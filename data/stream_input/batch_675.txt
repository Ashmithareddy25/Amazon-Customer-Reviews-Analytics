B000NA1OXY|1.0|I have listened to Avril Lavigne's previous albums and while I was not blown away by their content, they were not terrible. I would say I thought they were mediocre efforts at best with occasional hints of something better. In listening to this album, I am amazed at what a step back this is.  <br /> <br />First of all, the lyrical content is terrible. These are the egotistical and self-centered rantings of someone who sounds like a young teen. Delusions of greatness abound throughout each song. The maturity level on display is absolutely terrible. There's been no type of emotional growth in this person and, more than likely, there looks to be regression. Every song is about her and how fascinating and great she thinks herself to be. <br /> <br />Ignoring the lyrical content, the music is also a pretty poor effort. The order of the day appears to be shouting and layered vocals over the sound of clapping hands (or a facsimile thereof). All the songs sound the same. <br /> <br />I don't want to read too much into the current cultural landscape based on some pop album (and perhaps I am expecting too much thoughtfulness and musical experimentation/ingenuity for a pop album) but the ego displayed here is terrifying. This was just a terrible album. And again, I realize that I am probably not the target demographic and that I am expecting too much, but I listened to the album and this is what I thought of it. <br /> <br />sincerely, <br />R.C.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Patricia Arquette stars as Allison Dubois, an otherwise ordinary wife and mother who has the ability to help solve crimes through her dreams. Over a series of nights, Allison sees more and more details about the victims, which she shares with her boss, Phoenix District Attorney Manuel Devalos, and detective Lee Scanlon. <br /> <br />On the homefront, Allison is accompanied by her laidback husband Joe, a scientist, and their three daughters, Ariel, Bridgette and Marie. The girls are far apart in age -- Ariel in junior high, Bridgette in elementary, and little Marie just a toddler -- giving room to all sorts of growing-up issues. In this first season, the two older girls also show evidence of having inherited some of their mother's psychic abilities, which troubles both Allison and Joe. <br /> <br />Although there are other shows currently on air with extraordinary heroines, \\"Medium\\" continues to stand apart. Unlike some of the others, such as \\"Ghost Whisperer\\" starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, \\"Medium\\" doesn't try to make its cast look superhuman. Dreams aside, Allison's just a busy woman juggling a career and family, and she actually can be seen picking up dry cleaning or wearing old t-shirts as she hurriedly fixes her girls a late supper.  <br /> <br />Conversely, \\"GW\\"'s Melinda is perfect -- both in appearance and the way her life always goes her way -- which gets stale to the viewing audience pretty quickly. Who can possibly relate? Melinda's husband Jim has virtually no storylines of his own; his entire purpose appears to be supporting Melinda, listening to her prattle on about the cases she's working on, and maintaining the house for her as though he doesn't have a job himself. \\"Medium,\\" on the other hand, is too smart to insult its viewers by presenting such an improbable universe. <br /> <br />If you haven't ever seen \\"Medium,\\" I urge you to check it out immediately! You won't be disappointed.
0151013047|4.0|Excuse me, Sir, can I offer up an opinion on Mr.Hamid's mighty fine short novel? Yes you say.  But you fear not liking it as it is written as a long monolog. You say, again, you're not a big fan of this style so you will pass and read another book. Well, I can only answer that you will miss a valuable voice and I do so recommend this book.  Why? Well it offers a compelling and interesting view. It is about a very successful and well educated Pakistani immigrant's changing views of America. Correct, his name is Changez. Changez talks about how he comes to terms with his one great love, her name is Erica and recent events. You now look closely at me and I assume note the bulge under my arm beneath my jacket. Never you mind it is not what you think as I will not force you to read this. I suggest you do and it is up to you on what your reaction might be. Look I have to go right now. I will leave you to read and listen to Changez. It is something every American should do. But no you say, you really feel you know all you need to know about other countries. As I said to my last visitor, it would be good to have a cup of coffee and listen to Changez story.  But if you don't.... well let me just take my jacket off a while.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Well, it's official: The new RUSH is kickin me right into the dirt.<br /><br />3 standout tracks so far:<br /><br />~ The Larger Bowl - \\"Such a lot of pain on the earth\\" - Yeah this song is awesome. Killer bass sound, good sense of space in between the music, and Geddy emotes so well.<br /><br />~The Main Monkey Business - The first instrumental, and it is EPIC. I'd say this is the core of the album, right here (hence the title). It just jams out like they haven't in a long time. This is what I call RUSH in fine form (not like that instrumental from T4E, which was only \\"OK\\").<br /><br />~Bravest Face - Here is a throwback to Golden Era Rush, that is, Permanent Waves/Signals/Grace/Power Windows era, only leaner, meaner, somehow more stripped down in sound while retaining more heft in the delivery of lyrics/vocals. This is the kinda song we all listened to Rush for, back in the day.<br /><br />~ Hope<br /><br />I am listening to this acoustic 12-string solo instrumental played by Alex, and of course the first thing that comes to mind is: Jimmy Page. Man is it ever beautiful. We are talking, right here, about a post-White Summer ballad that conjures such complexities of reminscense and, yes, hope for the future, its enough to bring a tear to the most weathered eye. If only it weren't so short . . . but alas, isn't that often the way with hope ? The song is utter perfection. The rest of the band stood out for this one, and Let Lerxst shine.<br /><br />~ ~ ~<br /><br />Let me just say that this album is dense, alternating between a thoughtful heaviness that never goes over the top, and it is multilayered in such intricate ways as to present a difficult first - listening experience. After hearing the album the first time, I liked it ok, but I wasn't convinced it was better than Vapor Trails. Well luckily I decided to listen to the album on \\"repeat\\", because after the 3rd or 4th time, each song began spreading its wings and revealing all manner of glittering scales underneath, with odd gems of beauty here and there. It truly is a remarkable recording, and a close scrutiny of every song, and their sequence, reveals masters at the peak of their craft.<br /><br />After about 4 listens (and that says something in itself - that I could actually listen to it 4 times in a row) it was quite evident that Snakes & Arrows is a step up from Vapor Trails (which is definitely saying something - as VT is stellar in my opinion, despite other's claims it has \\"bad production\\").<br /><br />All of which is to say, RUSH is simply riding an escalating wave of creativity and inspiration, since T4E was released (arguably the \\"low\\" point of their career). With this kind of stunning complexity pulled off with such panache they make it look easy -- I can't imagine them stopping here.<br /><br />\\"I like that song about this wonderful world, it's got a sunny point of view, and sometimes I think its true, at least for a few of us. . . \\" (from Bravest Face, playing now in my headphones) . . . \\"Though we might have precious little, its still precious\\" . . . sound corny? Ha, that's one of RUSH's greatest strengths, ain't it though? Put on your bravest face . . . and I defy you to not to smile while hearing this song. It's got an almost funky groove to it, enwrapped with such glimmering hope and steeped in a sorrowful beauty that can only inspire the listener to greater heights.<br /><br />Let's hope the release & subsequent success of this album will do the same for RUSH.tering scales underneath, with odd gems of beauty here and there.

B00011CZRE|4.0|This is one of those movies that makes you cower in your seat as you cover your eyes repeatedly while viewing it.  Real scary stuff; one of the most frightening in its genre.    This movie was well formulated and the cast well-chosen.  Brad Pitt is perfect in the role of the young detective who wears his emotions on his sleeve, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the older, more patient but cynical mentor who tries to help the younger man.    Kevin Spacey plays the part of the insane killer who is on a misguided mission to save mankind from sin, murdering sinners to do so.  He's great in this role, also, leading the detectives from one bloody, gory crime scene to another and another, until he turns the tables on them in a surprise move.    The ending, though shocking and unexpected, is a brilliant piece of writing, but it ruined the movie for me.  I not only gasped at the ending, I cried for both detectives.  The movie left me craving a happier, more equitable kind of justice, so I had to lower my rating to 4-star, despite the extremely high-caliber of the acting and the screenplay.    SIDENOTE: You may have noticed that Amazon has made some changes to its website. If it looks the same to you right now, look out for a new format that will be rolling out gradually in the weeks to come.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|REVIEW <br />I think this is the finest work that Rush has ever done. The music is complex (as always), interesting, multi-genre, and emotional- but most of all: FUN! <br /> <br />Alex described the Vapor Trails album creation process as \\"painful.\\" The music reflected the struggle. However, the majority of Snakes & Arrows just makes me want to smile. It really flows well and speaks to me. This album evokes deep-seated emotions, especially the song Faithless, which is an unusual experience for a Rush song- at least for me. The emotion it invokes (at least in the author) is compassion, so it's not a bad thing. <br /> <br />There are slices of R&B, Blues, Country/Western, Metal, Hard Rock, Folk, and Soft Rock sprinkled throughout the disc, and most songs contain sounds from multiple genres. This album is a smorgasbord. <br /> <br />I get the feeling that the songs on this album are the band's attempt to aggregate a melee of varying riffs they've compiled over the years into cohesive songs. While that is the case on every album, it seems like we are being treated to a great many more creations on this album than on any other in the past. That may be partially due to the producer, \\"Booooge.\\" Regardless, it's rather refreshing to hear such a wide range of sounds within a single song. It is a testament to the band's ability to compose, and a demonstration of the continuing mastery of their instruments. Because of the variety it's rather difficult to get a feeling for the album by listening to sound bites of songs. Fortunately, a measly $11.99 will let you in on the full story. <br /> <br />BACKGROUND <br />Rush has often been described as \\"The Musicians' Musicians\\" because they write such interesting songs. As a musician you may not necessarily like a given song but you can more fully appreciate the effort it took not only to play it but to compose it in the first place.  I fully expect to see even more insane time signatures in the measures of the tablature that will be written for this album. Something like 23/7 sounds about right. Of course, Rush rarely writes any song within a single time signature, so that will be one of many odd times in the measures I'm sure. <br /> <br />I was rather surprised to see so many detracting reviews. While of course there are the die hard fanatics like myself, Rush still has what I call a \\"Budweiser\\" following. I've seen the same sort of thing with other bands, such as Queensryche. Creative people want to evolve, striving never to repeat prior efforts. I myself am not creative, but I understand this basic principle well as I have interacted with MANY artists over the years, including my little brother. However, not all fans/people evolve, and this often results in dissention. Rush's mission statement has always been to \\"get better.\\" It never ceases to amaze me that even in their mid 50's they can, indeed, \\"get better.\\" <br /> <br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR <br />I became aware of Rush through my brother's enlightening during the Moving Pictures epoch. I've been a devoted fan ever since. I haven't liked every song on every album, but I always knew enough to appreciate the effort. <br /> <br />I'm a recreational drummer with over 25 years under my belt. I am currently \\"between drum sets.\\" My last kit was a V-Session Pro, which is the prior generation from Roland. I own a Rickenbacker 4001 bass and I play a little guitar every now and then. <br /> <br />I'm a computer operations loser (i.e. Sys Admin) of over 5 years and have the awful body to prove it. <br />

B00005JPP6|4.0|Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, the guys that brought you Shaun of the Dead, bring you Hot Fuzz, a spoof/homage to buddy cop movies. Nicholas Angel (Pegg), the star officer of the London Police Force (actually, he'll tell you the word Service is more politically correct than Force), is being relocated to Sandford, a quiet village that appears to be perfect. He'll be teamed up with an incompetent partner named Danny (played by Nick Frost, also from Shaun). It doesn't take long for things to go sour and pretty soon, after a series of suspicious accidents all leading the victims to their deaths, Angel begins to believe they're dealing with a serial killer.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead; must have seen it about twenty times. Wright and Pegg's British humor was brilliant in Shaun and a lot of gags were so well orchestrated that upon repeated viewings, you could spot details in the background or clues in the characters's dialogue that led to punch lines later on in the film. They've managed to accomplish the same caliber of witty humor, long running gags, and escalating hilarity in Hot Fuzz. While not as good as its predecessor, Hot Fuzz builds up to one of the most amazing and hilarious climaxes in recent film history. Let's just say that the twenty-minute showdown at the end of the film gives any action film from recent years a run for its money.<br /><br />The first half of the film is your average buddy cop action comedy, featuring plenty of references to Point Break and Bad Boys, with a surprising amount of bloody deaths, all done in a comical way, of course. The second half really took things to the next level, transforming an already very funny movie into a whodunit in the tradition of Agatha Christie. All the clues and machinations culminate into a dazzling third act. The supporting cast includes Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge, Gangs of New York) and former 007, Timothy Dalton, who shines as a sleazy large scale store owner. Edgar Wright directs this little gem with the same deft hand as in Shaun of the Dead, using many of his now famous camera tricks.<br /><br />Kudos to Wright and Pegg for taking a direction such as this; they wrote a very coherent story and succeeded in taking a turn for the unexpected. It's laughs galore in Hot Fuzz, so if you're a fan of Shaun of the Dead or British comedies, you owe it to yourself to see this film.is little gem with the same deft hand as in Shaun of the Dead, using many of his now famous camera tricks. <br /> <br />Kudos to Wright and Pegg for taking a direction such as this; they wrote a very coherent story and succeeded in taking a turn for the unexpected.

074356619X|5.0|I absolutely love this audio book. I listen to it pretty much everyday while I'm working. I found it to be insightful, instructional, motivating, and encouraging. \\"The Secret\\" doesn't contain anything new. It simply shines a new light on the power of positive thinking, being optimistic, and avoiding pessimistic thoughts.  <br /> <br />What I really liked about, \\"The Secret\\" is the quality of the recording. It has a very well mixed sound track. I liked how the music corresponded well with the topic transitions. It made listening to the book very relaxing and almost meditative. <br /> <br />Rhona Byrne has a very soothing voice that's enjoyable to listen to. Her voice would be perfect on guided meditation CD's. I enjoyed hearing her talk and that made listening to \\"The Secret\\" more enjoyable.  <br /> <br />The topic \\"The Secret\\" covers is nothing new or extraordinary. It's been covered hundreds if not thousands of times by financial gurus, authors, entrepreneurs, and other successful people. I however found Rhona Byrne's way to be much more enlightening and refreshing.  <br /> <br />\\"The Secret\\" is very well produced. It is a perfect combination of instruction, enlightenment, and motivation. I like how Rhona included other successful teachers, leaders, gurus, and visionaries into the book. I liked hearing other successful people's personal uses of positive thinking.  <br /> <br />I really liked this audio book and it's well worth the price. It's very motivational and can be listened to multiple times.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|All it should matter it's the fact that it's an absolutely fun and solid album. It's one of the best ones of the year. There are no fillers at all. Every single song is pretty empowering, makes you feel all energetic and happy! I love to play it while I'm on my car and sing to the top of my lungs  thinking that \\"I can do better\\", that I can totally forget all those ex-lovers that have done me so much harm... Yeah, maybe there are no deep lyrics but who cares? Sometimes it's all about the fun. When you are in the mood to get depressed and deep, then play some Tori Amos. When you just wanna have fun driving around, put on \\"The best damn thing\\"!

B00000JSJC|2.0|I may strike a nerve here, but I have to say this big time. I am glad I didn't spend money on this film as I found it to be way too long, and way below average. This kind of reminded me of watching the 1987 film \\"Wanted: Dead or Alive\\". I mean there was no less than 200 spews of profanity in the first 10 minutes of the film. I was beginning to think they were getting off on swearing, and explode into a sexual ecstasy of screams and moans at the rate they were going. The film has the plot on New Year's Eve, 1999, and Los Angeles is a war zone( When wasn't it ever a war zone people?), and the drug of the day is a head piece that allows you to play back certain scenes with certain people, and it more, or less makes it a hot commodity, and everyone tries to cash in on the thing, and in the long run it causes strife, and conflict in a community that's already in a fire of decay, anger, hate, and any other negative, and critical thing you can imagine. The National Guard is out patroling the streets along with the city police, and the rogue police as well, and they can't be trusted either. One ex-cop turned dealer in the head piece is trying to help rescue a ex-girlfriend out of the clutches of a pimp/ record producer, and prevent the Millenium from going bust at the same time, and it's hard to tell who's on your side. This is what the world wants though. We have developed the theory that Fear is the beginning of enlightment, and therefore the more fearful we are then the more smart we are. We don't take time for friends, family, to enjoy life, or appreciate the beauty of the world. That's what the head piece is for we say, but guess what? The head piece also can be like a bad batch of acid which can kill you if you're not careful. Ralph Fiennes and Angela Baseheart give a convincing performance as you would see them in love with one another, and in a way they may have had the feelings repressed way down inside of one another as Fiennes when he was a cop rescued Baseheart's family especially her son, so the feelings were there, and they build during the film until thier passionate kiss at the end which to me was the highlight of the movie. The rest of it was a weak plot where excessive swearing has to give it meat, the other performances were at best lackluster, and just the fact that it shows the world as a place that I already know it is didn't make me feel any better. Not even worth a $1.00 price to watch. I wanted to watch it back when it first came out in the theaters, but now I'm glad I didn't.
B000O178BY|5.0|Trent has obviously grown up with this album. He spends much of the album creating sounds that are all at once, spooky, beautiful, creative and disturbing. Much like the a human being. We all have our good/bad/indifferent sides and it translates to his music here. I applaud him for taking a conceptional album and running with it. You cannot really appreciate this album unless you listen to it all at once. Of course that doesn't mean there aren't songs that stand alone by their own merits-there are plenty of them to be loaded onto your iPod; \\"The Beginning of the End\\", \\"Survivalism\\", and \\"Capital G\\" are instant classics in my opinion. Trent has shown us a maturity with this album as well: while previous albums had their social, political and human condition elements, Year Zero does the best to be a warning to us here in 2007. Change what we are doing now, or suffer the consequences. His music is even more relevant now than it was back in the early 1990's. It's nice to see him back shacking our private little worlds a bit and making us think. All-in-all I cannot help but give this effort a HUGE endorsement!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Well, after about 20 listens and going back forth from the older albums to this one I have decided to declare Snakes a total success. If Rush is not recognized for this masterpiece by the likes of the R&R Hall of Fame and the AMA's the critics have no taste in music. Armor and Sword may be one of the best tunes to come out this millenium. Rush loves controversy and that song is very controversial. You know the religiosos will go nuts when they hear \\"their heaven\\". Couple that with the song Faithless and the late Pope will be turning in his grave. Come on, \\"Nobody gets to their heavan without a fight\\". How telling in so many ways is that lyric with what is going on in today's world? If you haven't already done so, you need to order this thing today. It will be well worth the money. An instant classic. Move over Stones, Rush has claimed the title of the \\"Best Band\\" in the history of the world. Simply brilliant.  See you June 23 at the Nissan Pavilion at which time I will know it by heart and singing at the top of my lungs \\"I can get back on\\" with Geddy[[ASIN:B00004Z3F0 My Favorite Headache]].
B000NVIXFK|5.0|After three or more spins you will really begin to enjoy this one. After the first listen I thought, that's it? Although Vapor Trails had some good songs, Snakes and Arrows is much better as a whole. I can't wait to see them on tour June 22nd!
0151012768|4.0|This enjoyable book features the kind of \\"British\\" humor (or, should I say, humour?) spanning Monty Python to The Office that is the island's most valuable export to America.  Plus, I learned a little bit about Yemen, which I didn't know the first thing about.
B000O75F7C|3.0|This is my first Porcupine Tree record and I have a mixed review. <br /> <br />First off I find the CD to be very very dark lyrically and musically.  This isn't necessarily bad but it is noteworthy.  You aren't getting a 'pickmeup' here. <br /> <br />The title track is a classic progressive tune starting out thoughtfully mellow and gradually reaching a crescendo as more and more instruments delve into the catchy groove.  The song is really moving and working nice until the last minute or 2 where it dies out in disappointment.  Editing out the last 90 seconds would have made it a better song.  So often less is more!! <br /> <br />The second song is nice but again here it takes too long to find it's rhythm. <br /> <br />Anesthetize, the 3rd track is a gem but it has the same problems as the others -- It dies out at the end.  This is a 17 minute epic with nifty riffs and although a bit repetitive keeps you moving and on your feet all the way through about the 10 - 12 minute mark and they find a great jam but inexplicably do little to nothing for the final 4 minutes.  Another blank spot that could have been edited out to make it stronger. <br /> <br />The last 3 songs are not as strong as the first 3 and the final song should have been left off the album completely. <br /> <br />Overall I give it 3 stars - 'good'.  Enough good stuff here to tempt me to pick up another PT record.
1878424505|5.0|This was an inspiring read.  The Four Agreements are beautiful, fresh,  and uplifting concepts that one can easily integrate immediately. Ruiz believes we need not stay addicted to  beliefs that limit us,  nor should we strive for perfection, but always do our best. While  reading this profound yet simple book, I recognized  beliefs I had  adopted since childhood that were based in fear, not in reality. Being free of these limiting ideas allows me to live fully and joyously in  the present. <br /> <br />Another book filled with supportive and effortless ways to live magically in the \\"now\\" is called \\" How To Create A Magical  Relationship\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  There are three principals that  make living a brilliant life a possibility right now...without working  at it!  I can feel all of these authors' integrity and generosity on every page.
B000O75F7C|5.0|This is yet another impressive release from Porcupine Tree, though it stands apart from their last two albums due to the re-institution of Pink Floyd influences and the occasional touch of Led Zeppelin.  Though there are certainly sections that rock hard with forceful guitar riffs the emphasis on this release is more or less to achieve a balance through the use of excellent arrangements and flawless production tricks.  While there are only six tracks, the total running time is lengthy (50:53), due in large part to the epic \\"Anesthetize\\" which comes in at nearly 18 minutes long.  The title track would have sounded right at home on their previous album, \\"Deadwing\\".  \\"My Ashes\\" has keyboard flourishes that reminded me of the Led Zeppelin tune \\"No Quarter\\" but is mostly a spacey ballad with music that flows effortlessly.  Then the epic centerpiece \\"Anesthetize\\" unfolds and it is nothing less than masterful, with Pink Floyd-like sections enveloping the charging guitars and the addition of Alex Lifeson from Rush incorporating a guitar solo; the whole affair is absolutely mesmerizing. \\"Sentimental\\" sounds like a found classic from their superb album \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and it is the essence of melancholy beauty with a recycled riff straight off \\"In Absentia\\" (the song \\"Trains\\", to be exact) making a cameo appearance near the end.  \\"Way Out of Here\\" is easily the most progressive of all the tracks as it is the only song here where the entire band took part in the songwriting and is a Pink Floyd rocker with outstanding band interplay and focus from all concerned.  \\"Sleep Together\\" comes across as an organic version of a mid-tempo Nine Inch Nails song with yet another Led Zeppelin keyboard section that sounds a bit like \\"Kashmir\\".  Even though Porcupine Tree's last two albums (\\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\") are slightly heavier overall, there are plenty of sections throughout \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" that match those moments pound for pound while seemlessly integrating their pastinfluences with passion and precision.  The brilliant arrangements, flawless production, and highly intelligent lyrics are all here.  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />1. FEAR OF A BLANK PLANET (7:28) <br />2. MY ASHES (5:07) <br />3.

B00005JPFH|5.0|(4 1/2 *'s) Mainly for better than for worse `Spider-Man 3' comes back with a vengeance.  Not nearly as riveting as its classic predecessor 'Spider-man 2,' this movie swings ahead admirably enough.  Just when this adventure starts to reek of overconfidence, we find a fresh trek going in unexpected directions.  While 'Spider-Man 2' made our hero a constantly beleaguered underdog, #3 shuffles the deck of perilous contingencies.  Seldom extraneous or convoluted, the peril and story lines are still inventive enough to keep our interest.  Indeed, the shifting developments are at times intense and frightening.   In epic and intricate proportions, this installment seldom fails to awe.       We begin where we left off with impending engagement between Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry's (James Franco) angst against Peter for his father's death.  At first the rift between Peter and Harry takes a run-of-the-mill amnesia course, but the subsequent developments provide greater vigor.  Meanwhile, Peter's uncle's killer, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison to become the Sandman, an elusive monster with morphing dimensions.  If one villain isn't enough, then Peter's new newspaper rival, Brock and alter-ego, Venom (suavely and savagely played by Topher Grace) comes to roost after Peter's professor develops an evil transformative potion that even gives Spiderman a new makeover.  (Spiderman`s inner conflict gives us more depth than previously provided, and the startling visual effects are less recycled than reinvented.  Both keep us guessing.)      Still retaining characters we love (Peter's aunt still provides badly needed tenderness, and his growling newspaper editor boss is still the lovable curmudgeon) but giving us a whole new venue, 'Spider-Man 3' promises many sequels to come.  Although the tension is diminished compared to the masterpiece of 'Spiderman 2,' #3 is an edgy and excellent edition to the 'Spiderman' franchise.  Sam Raimi's directing refuses to dwell on past laurels, and the sharp editing ably assists eye-popping visuals.  Hopefully, the `Spiderman' franchise will continue to be this worthy.   Penetrating and often startling, 'Spider-Man 3' seldom disappoints.
B00005JPFH|3.0|And, so, I'll give Spider-Man 3 a nostalgic 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />I so wanted to love this movie. I liked the original Spider-Man, which was really fun, but didn't bear up during repeating viewings. Still, it was thrilling to watch, and captured Spidey's origins perfectly, even if the villain never really seemed particularly villainous. And then I really, really liked Spider-Man 2. It had the right mix of tenderness, energy, and action, and a fight sequence on a train that I'll never forget. The image of Toby Maguire trying to stop a speeding train was amazing, as was the touching carrying of his body by the appreciative men and women whose lives he saved. Simply poetic (as films, and even comic books, can sometimes be).<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 was a big let down for me. From a higher altitude, it has a bloated and a serviceable, but deeply flawed, script. The story has moments of real joy, energy, pathos and humor, but they're stuck in this undisciplined soup of emotions and transparent plot devices. It could have used a solid rewrite or two, and a hefty pair of scissors.<br /><br />The result is that the previously multi-faceted Spider-Man gets depicted in these broad, one-note strokes. His role is filled with repetitive beats, and instead of a clear character arc, he flips this way and that, black suit then not, until finally it's hard to figure who he is at the end of the film. How many times do we need to be hit over the head to figure out that Peter Parker is oblivious to the problems that beset his diva girlfriend? And because the story is so long and bloated, it forces us to swallow just one too many doses of the sage Aunt May (enough already with the dime store philosophy and the frugal nobility) and far too much of the whiny Mary Jane (who gives \\"emo\\" a new meaning). Why the heck does he want to marry her anyway? For a life of that? Gwen Stacy comes blowing in as this sweet, sensible, and shockingly gorgeous lab partner, and who does he want to be with? (Why didn't anyone tell me that Bryce Dallas Howard was such a knockout?)<br /><br />James Franco does a good job emoting, but, like the rest, fights against a meandering character arc that simply doesn't ring true or reflect the streamlined economy of a carefully crafted script. Also fighting the bloat is Topher Grace, who shows some wonderful comedic physicality, as well as deft handling of dialog. We don't get enough of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. We never do.<br /><br />There are some great effects, terrific fights, and magnificent visuals. There are scenes that not only work splendidly, but that maybe could only be pulled off by Sam Raimi. And despite its flaws, Spider-Man 3 is head and shoulders about so many superhero films -- way better than Superman Returns (by Bryan Singer, again tone deaf to story), The Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider (ouch), and Daredevil.  Yet, as I found myself checking my watch as Spider-Man 3 meandered along for well over two hours, I started thinking that the franchise may have lost its juice -- or that we reached that lamentable point where success and self-indulgence collide, and where self-discipline, economy, and the hunger for excellence suffer.<br /><br />I think I'll watch Spider-Man 2 again. That's the last memory I want of our web-slinging, awkward teen who captivated the hearts of awkward teens (like me) for so long. Adieu, Spidey. It was fun while it lasted.e tell me that Bryce Dallas Howard was such a knockout?)

0060887303|5.0|Okay, I found out about this book from one of my freshmen.  She brought it in one day and asked me if I could please read it, because she absolutely LOVED the book and needed someone to talk to about it....and said that her friends weren't really \\"into reading.\\"  I took the book home, thinking that I'd get around to it later.....maybe next week.  Maybe not.  I was wrong.  I started reading when I got home and couldn't put the book down.  You won't want to put it down either.  It really IS that good.<br /><br />Other reviews have basically told the story here: five friends are bound by a secret, referred to as \\"the Jenna thing,\\" until one of the girls, Alison, goes missing at the end of their seventh grade year.  Skip ahead to eleventh grade, when the remaining four girls begin receiving alarming text messages.  It's a mystery that grabs you and won't let go.<br /><br />I've seen several copies of this book (and #2 Flawless) floating around our school lately, thanks to word of mouth advertising.  I'm 30something and LOVED the book...my students are 14-18 years old and also love it.  Friendship, mystery, boys, all of the big topics pop up in this book.  Grab a copy and get hooked!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Yes, see the movie \\"Stand by Me.\\" It took me right back. Those boys walking down the railroad tracks were my friends and me. I even knew an Ace Merrill, but \\"Big Al\\" was nice to us boys.<br /><br />At the beginning of \\"Stand by Me\\" when Richard Dryfus is remembering the good old days, you can really feel it--especially as BB King's \\"Stand by Me\\" is played in the background. A scene of only a minute--so poignant!<br /><br />One night we took off on our bicycles and raided a driving range, filling two five-gallon buckets with beat-up range balls that had been left out. What an adventure! Also, a crime. Oops! Does this post count as a legal confession?
B000NVIXDW|3.0|First off, let me say that I am not musically talented myself so anything I have to say is strictly my opinion. On that note, I am disappointed with this new album. I purchased the special edition CD because I wanted \\"LOVE.\\" I truly love this song. Nat King Cole sang this, right? I thought it was okay. The very best song is \\"Everything.\\" I could listen to it all day. The rest of the album is mediocre. I don't like when Michael Buble sings with other people... it's distracting and he just doesn't need the help. I have two other Michael Buble albums that I like very, very much... self-titled album and \\"It's Time\\". These are definitely worth the money but this new album was not nearly as good. I hope Michael goes back to the sassier and jazzier songs on his previous albums instead of the sad and depressing ones on his new album.
1416914285|5.0|So, I bought this and read it because I needed something to fill the time, but I went into it not expecting much. Personally, I found it to be excellent... the characters are witty and amusing, the plot is well laid and just intricate enough to entice, but not enough to confuse. There were one or two little continuity errors, but Ms. Clare is a first time author, so that's to be expected. <br /> <br />I can't wait for the rest of this series!
0743496728|5.0|It is impossible not to be captured into this story from the moment you begin reading it!  The downside?  Be ready to give up some sleep because between myself and two friends that borrowed it, we all read it within a day and a half - because we couldn't put it down for that long!!<br /><br />I have been a fan of Jodi's books for years and I truly think this one hits the number one mark on my list.
0345451325|4.0|Lest this sound like damning with faint praise, it's not. I picked up this book on a whim after ordering a copy of the PC game and waiting for it to arrive, so this was my first introduction to the Halo universe. It turned out to be a most excellent one, and I knew that I would definitely be reading more in the series. I think what sold me most on the book was its depiction of the early training of the Spartans as children. The chapter in particular that truly hooked me was the one in which the young Spartans must win control of a drop ship from a squad of adult soldiers in order to complete their training mission. While it may not be the most original story--the training sequences feel very much inspired by Orson Scott Card's [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]]--it is written in a way that is always compelling. It fleshes out the world created for the game, and that is what makes the game itself so addictive. You honestly believe that these characters inhabit this world, because it is so fully realized.<br /><br />So, yeah, these books certainly haven't won any awards, and I'd never have expected them to. That really isn't the point, though. They exist for those of us who can't get enough of this universe just through playing the games, and for that, they are excellent.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Terrific new studio material that reminds me of the approach on Vapor Trails, My Favorite Headache and Presto. Great melodies and music throughout- especially Far Cry, Armor and Sword, Spindrift and The Way the Wind Blows. I also like the instrumentals. I can't say enough about Geddy Lee. His bass playing is superb as always. His singing is great and melodic. Alex also does some fine work. Neil is also solid. I'm happy that Rush is alive and as vibrant as ever.
0393327655|4.0|There has been a sudden flow of books by atheists -- and considering that atheists are the most maligned folks around (at least at home here in the US) this is indeed welcome. Sam Harris is part of a long stream of authors like Dennett, Richard Dawkins, David Mills, Victor Stenger, and Christopher Hitchens attacking the issue from different directions and perspectives. Sam Harris is well-renowned, has studied religion, and expresses his ideas and arguments with precision. This book does a fine job of demolishing the notion that faith is some kind of virtue.     However, I think his assessment of the middle eastern problem as almost totally driven by religious belief is wrong. Islam, like almost all other religions, does have its violent parts -- as does Christianity and Judaism(Sam quotes some shocking passages from Dueteronomy, for instance). But we have other forces at work as well -- national pride for instance. It seems likely that national pride anywhere (even if the prevailing religion is atheism) will be stung badly if armies of a foreign nation are stationed in their country. I am not denying the fact that the particular country contains the holiest two places in Islam doesn't exacerbate the situation. But at the fundamental level, there is a basic issue and it has nothing to do with Islam. Even something comparitively innocuous as a subsidary of Dubai port authority having some control over ports in the US inflames passions here. Sam Harris also seems to brush off collateral damage in (say) Iraq with a kind of \\"we mean well so it is ok\\" attitude.     Anyways, this is not a book about the middle east really. Sam Harris does a great job of breaking the invisible legs of faith and religion. Four stars.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|What can I say about Star Wars that hasn't already been said?    Not much.    This is quite possibly one of the most perfect films ever made. Since its initial release it has become a long-lasting international phenomenon and an American cultural icon. How many other films in history have kept such a large and faithful fan base 30 years after it was released?    This latest (and I'm POSITIVE it's not the last) release of this classic film is somewhat of a letdown. Many were outraged at the 1997 special edition and demanded the original theatrical release, but it looked as though that was not going to happen (yeah, right!). Finally, the original untouched version was given to us, but with no image upgrade or quality sound; plus, the image was letterboxed, not widescreen (BIG difference for those \\"in the know\\" and care about such things (like me)).    Fear not, true believers. In an attempt to bag another zillion, Lucas is sure to release yet another version of his beloved creation, only this time it will be in DTS and Dolby 5.1 as well as anamorphic widescreen.    You know it's going to happen. It's just a matter of time.    As for me, I REFUSE to purchase this title (I purchased the 2004 special editions because it was all I could get at the time). When Lucas finally comes to his senses and releases what I really want, I'll be happy to part with some of my money. Until that day, any other \\"editions\\" will be completely ignored by me.
B000O174CM|5.0|The film is great. I saw it 3 times in the theater to get my full \\"fix\\". The plot isn't really anything new. Struggling musical group gets their big break and then money, egos, and relationships start to mess everything up. Life long friends become bitter enemies and all that fame and money starts to feel real hollow. What makes \\"Dreamgirls\\" more than just another typical musical drama is the amazing combination of a stellar cast, an outstanding score, and a genius of a director. The sets, the costumes, the choreography, the editing: this movie just reeks of high quality and the kind of dedication that breeds Oscar worthy movies. Of course, the greatest treat is seeing some knockout performances, most notably from newcomer Jennifer Hudson and veteran Eddie Murphy. This movie just moves my soul. I really felt for the characters and what they were going through. It seems like the movie musical is a thing of the past but Bill Condon and Company prove that it can still be done and done well. <br /> <br />I bought the \\"Showstopper Edition\\" and it's definitely a must for the fans. The first disc has extended and deleted musical numbers. To see some of the numbers in their less edited form was exciting for me because I loved the music. Disc 2 has some featurettes and a more comprehensive look at the making of the film. Plus some screen tests for Beyonce and Anika Noni Rose. The best part of the \\"Building A Dream\\" documentary is the section \\"Gonna Take A Mean Ride Side A & B\\" which shows you a day to day look at the production from rehearsals, to recording the songs, and to the actual filming of scenes. The special features were worth the extra change BUT I was very dissapointed that there was no commentary by the director or the stars. I feel like there are more stories to be told about this incredible production. I guess there's a \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" edition in the works. But for now, the \\"Dreamgirls\\" 2 disc treatment delivers a ton of behind the scenes info and trivia that will satisfy any Dreams fan.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|Your kidding me, right? I thought I would never NOT like the Peppers music, but I'm there! Has Anthony been taking voice lessons in a room with scented candles, an area rug and herbal tea? They need to visit that house that they recorded BSSM in or go back Under the Bridge. I am not inducing past habits so please don't attack me. It's a euphemism folks. It's almost sitting in the doctor's office' music. What happened to Flea's bass? Did he suffer 'Kirk Hammett'ism? I actually heard the entire cd from my brother who's also dissapointed in wasting 14 bucks. Let's Resurrect Hilal! Keep John, he's still a great guitarist but they need that fire under their tails again. They can keep this crap!<br /><br />FISHBONE STILL RULES!<br /><br />BROOKLYN,<br /><br />S T A N D  U P!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|After Moving Pictures I could never really get the Signal Rush was sending out. Every album that came I hoped for (what I considered) the real thing. With so many synth recordings and mediocre efforts I simply concluded that Rush had lost the power that made them the legends they are.    Enter Snakes and Arrows. I can see now that they never had lost the magic that I loved. They simply liked the music they were playing and I didn't. Ok, that's life.    I am glad to have been wrong. Rush is capable of some of the most fulfilling, expressive and magnificent music that any rock band can produce. I find all of these Rush attributes on this CD. Yes, they have come back home but not in a nostalgic backward kind of way. No, in my opinion they have returned to there magnificence with all the forward motion I would expect from a progressive, mature band that has the possibility to \\"re-legend\\" themselves.    Diverse, rich and solid. Production quality is excellent. I predict huge record sales and thousands upon thousands of very, very happy Rush fans like myself. Thanks Geddy, Neil and Alex. I've been waiting many years for this record and you delivered. Excellent, thanks.
B000067CPX|2.0|I thought the Peppers would recover from Californication but it just got worst. Sorry, this cd SUX! I didn't know Lawrence Welk was still alive until I heard this trash. I guess the socks are soo long ago.<br /><br />Fishbone RULES!<br /><br />BROOKLYN S T A N D  U P!
B000HCO83Q|4.0|This movie was ok, it was good overall, I mean the twist and people in the characters that was affected, blew me away, but then again Im not a heavy die hard X-men fan, but i do like 'em.  I will say this movie was good, kept my attention and i was like jaw dropping, and in awe when certain things happen (dont want to give it away) I thought this was a good movie, but as for one part of the movie, i was like \\"What the blue heeba buh jeeba is going on?\\" lol but it kept me wanting MORE!! It was like \\"Oh my, what's next?\\"  Great film in that aspect, but I recommend this!
B00000J7JO|2.0|No, not the Primus cd \\"Frizzle Fry\\", this is my evaluation of this cd. Good songs but not BURSTING like they were on BSSM or Mother's Milk and not even CLOSE to Uplift Mofo Party Plan. They play some tof these songs on Lite FM. These guys are getting older with the music. Fishbone-Now there's a band that has been consistant for OVER 20 years! Longer than the Peppers (check you history before you debate me!). They are still great musicians but the Umph is gone. Last GREAT cd was BSSM. One Hot Minute was there downfall. Navarro is an average guitarist. They should have kept Arik Marshall. Just my opinion.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|Having watched the series on Discovery HD Theater, I thought I knew what to expect. Wrong! The full unedited and uncompressed HD-DVD verion from the BBC really outshines the televised version. I can't believe the American editors dropped the Emperor Penquins from Pole to Pole. And the special beauty of the changing seasons in the Northeast. While I'm a big fan of Sigorney Weaver (she was a great choice for the American Edition), I can't help but feel the series was \\"dumbed down\\" a bit for US television viewers. I'm so glad the HD-DVD series features the complete original BBC production.
B000AP04L0|4.0|Milton is the funniest movie character in years. Office Space is a pure example of comedic genius. The acting and story line take back stage to outrageous laughs and gags that never fail to deliver.<br /><br />It's honestly the most unreal story in the world, but it's a way that the common man can live vicariously through the actors. Who hasn't wanted to really just sluff off at work? Who hasn't felt underappreciated? Who hasn't thought that the office itself would fall apart if they left?<br /><br />One word of caution to take from this, however. Don't steal your co-worker's stapler!
B000EYK4KI|4.0|This movie was almost as entertaining as the off-screen love triangle that this movie sparked between Pitt, Jolie, and Aniston. You get a sense that Pitt and Jolie are falling in lust with each other during the making of this (who could blame them?) and that helps intensify every scene (as if it needed it). Wild and fun and stylish, the only thing that might have improved it would have been a cameo from Aniston herself. Come to think of it, she may have wanted to visit the set more often.
B000059R8Y|3.0|I just dusted this off and gave it a listen.  I was underwhelmed the first time I listened to it several years ago, but now it sounds pretty good to me.  I will say it is a significant improvement over \\"Pilgrim\\" which I also dusted off, listened to, and promptly sold back to my local music store.  It is obvious that the material on \\"Reptile\\" fits Clapton much better than the material on \\"Pilgrim.\\"  I will be keeping \\"Reptile.\\"
B00005JPFF|4.0|I loved Spider-man 3. I've heard the biggest knocks about it is that it tries to cover too much ground and that it's a soap opera. I was worried myself that it wasn't going to be able to cover everything. It has Sandman, Gwen Stacey, Venom, Harry Osborn and Spidies turburlent relationship with MJ to deal with, thats alot of ground! but it also makes for a great movie. My gripe is that ever though it covered all of these story lines, it did it by simplifying most of them so they could fit. The action in the film is the best of the series and the best I've seen in all of the Marvel movies. There are a great number of fights and all of them are complex and dazzling to watch. The best part of of Spider-Man 3? The sub text of the plot. While it is a comic book movie and it's got all the eye candy to keep the kids and fan boys glued to their seats, it has a very rewarding moral. Spider-man 3 is a film of friendship and forgiveness. The characters of the film are often hurting each other out of pride or arrogance. The film shows that even though these things can be devastating to our personal relationships, forgiveness and understanding are always options to make amends.Through all of it's razzle dazzle and high octain action I found Spider-man 3 to be a deeper and more \\"Human\\" comic book film than most of the others combined. Go for the action but maybe you can walk away from it with alitte more. Wonderful film.

0307277887|5.0|Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter technician for the Miami Police Department.  Besides being an expert at his job Dexter is also a vigilante of sort.  In his spare time, he hunts down serial killers and kills them.  One could almost support Dexter in his hunt for justice except that there is a big problem.  Dexter enjoys killing... and he enjoys it way too much.  Dexter is, in fact, a serial killer who only kills evil people.  He is a conscienceless sociopath who feels nothing for human beings but feels compelled to make them suffer.  And he is the hero of the story.  Dexter does everything he can to appear normal.  He has a girlfriend that he treats well but he cares nothing for her.  He has learned to look and act like any other person in Miami.<br /><br />But sometimes trying to convince everyone he is normal forces Dexter to do things he might not otherwise do.  Dexter's sister, Deborah, is also in the Miami Police Department and she desperately wants to get out of Vice and into Homicide.  When a series of brutal killings occur, she sees an opportunity to get recognized.  She doesn't know her brother is a serial killer but she does know that her brother sometimes seems to have an insight into the criminal mind and wants Dexter's help.  But this killer is something truly special... someone that Dexter is not prepared to go up against.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that a book that makes a hero of a serial killer could be so enthralling, humorous, and enjoyable but Jeff Lindsay has suceeded in creating a sympathetic sociopath.  Writing the book in the first person is ingenious as it lets us see into the mind of Dexter and allows Dexter to talk to us and show us his self-deprecating, sarcastic humor.  I could  like Dexter (even if he could never actually care about another person) if it wasn't for that little character quirk of occasionally letting The Dark Passenger, as he refers to his compulsion to kill, take control and drive him to unspeakable acts of cruelty.<br /><br />My daughter told me about this book and she was right that it is amazingly good.  After struggling through the Dante Club for weeks I finished this in three days and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Lindsay keeps the story moving so fast that we forget that we are rooting for a serial killer.  No, it is not going to win an award for literary genius but as a guilty pleasure it is a great read.cruelty.   <br /> <br />My daughter told me about this book and she was right that it is amazingly good.

B00005JLR2|5.0|Treasure Planet is by far one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. I'm so shocked it gets such bad reviews!  <br /> <br />It's a classic story of adventure and coming-of-age, adapted from the novel \\"Treasure Island\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. No, it is not a direct interpretation! But that's ok. The characters and the story are adapted from the novel to fit with the culture and imagination of today's world, and given a magical twist, as if 1800s England had special sci-fi technology.  <br /> <br />In this version, Jim is a boy of fifteen whose father-angst has left him committing crimes and having trouble at home and at school, much to the pain of his young mother, Sarah. A chance meeting with old Billy Bones, former cabin-boy to the dreaded pirate Captain Flint, ends with him being given the map and key to Treasure Planet, a fabled place that contains the Loot of a Thousand Worlds, taken by Flint. This begins Jim's chance to set out on his own and learn about the world and who he is, and what potential he has.  <br /> <br />The relationship between Silver and Jim is similar, but not exactly the same. It becomes a deep father/son relationship, with Jim finding in Silver what he always wanted from his deadbeat father. Silver is enigmatic, double-faced, and powerful, but grows a deep, unexpected soft spot for Jim that changes his mind about the treasure he's always sought.  <br /> <br />Overall, I think the movie is fantastic. The animation is buttery smooth and is visually stunning, the characters are unique and interesting and all have a history long before the story takes place, and the adaptation from the original novel is very clever and updates the story well. The music, done by James Newton Howard and Johnny Rzeznik, is absolutely gorgeous, with a touch of Celtic influence added to the powerful orchestrations and themes. The story is heartwarming and powerful.
1591840562|5.0|This book was like a breath of fresh air, confirming much of what we're already doing. I have been a little distracted by some critics but reading this book just put me at ease. This book is for you if need confidence that starting a new company without much more than a good idea and a good supply of sweat energy can be done. One key ingredient is the patience to bootstrap until the time is right for bigger moves.
0689825498|5.0|My 18 month old loves this book, only second to Eric Carle's \\"From Head to Toe\\".  The flaps are pretty sturdy, as he has not bent or ripped off any of them (yet), even though he \\"reads\\" it himself quite a bit. <br /> <br />Definite must have!
0143037757|1.0|This book gives an outline of the history of post-war Europe. In roughly chronological order it discusses the main milestones of European history: the aftermath of WWII, the Cold War, the \\"Culture Wars\\", Europe after the collapse of Communism etc. The second part gives an account of the political and ideological of developments the author considers crucial. <br /> <br />The book is off to a very good start: It stresses the centrality of the Holocaust in making morality and human dignity not just one of many considerations but the very touchestone by which political decisions are supposed to be measured in Europe. Indeed a large part of the book is devoted to investigating the extent to which this principle has been applied by European nations since 1945 and the author passionately criticizes their failures in this respect. <br /> <br />It is then all the more disappointing that in the book the universality of this principle is often abandoned in favor of a rather cynical interpretation which, in the case of international affairs, is based on Realpolitik, strategic considerations and, possibly, even ethnic prejudices. <br /> <br />An example from domestic affairs is the disrespect towards attempts by either right- or left-of-center movements towards a fairer society. The set-backs (in the author's view) of the social-democratic parties on the one hand and Thatcher's policies on the other are treated in a way that comes close to Schadenfreude. The author does not have to agree with any of these ideologies but he should have assessed them according to the extent to which they they were true to their own underlying moral principles, or, at least, he should respect them for aiming at what they think is a better society. <br /> <br />A second example is the glossing over (by omission, relativization or, possibly, denial) of Turkey's attitudes towards human rights and international relations. In fact, it blames Western prejudice for the poor image of the country in these respects, without accounting for the facts (widely known in the international press) that have caused this poor image: the Armenian Genocide (enclosed in quotation marks in the book) and Turkey's continuous refusal to acknowledge it, the often brutal suppression of the Kurdish minority, the serious problems facing non-Muslims etc. The book does not mention at all important facts on Turkey, such as the suppression of non-Muslim educational and religious institutions, the 1945 \\"property tax\\" designed to target non-Muslim minorities and the 1955 pogroms against Christians and Jews. <br /> <br />In all that, the book is not unique. The nihilism in domestic affairs and the selective downplaying of specific people's or nations' actions that would normally be condemned is all too common. However, for a book that begins by showing so convincingly the importance of Morality, historical Memory and the priority of preventing all human suffering, it is deeply disappointing.
B00005JPFH|5.0|This movie was the best movie of all time and is definately my favorite of all Spiderman movies.  Great acting, great directing, great story.  I love the theme of the \\"battle within\\".  I would reccomend this movie to anyone who is a fan of spiderman, action flicks, or even family people that want to teach their children good morals.  Trust me.... there is a message in this movie that we can all benefit from.  I just got back from the midnight screening and I cannot wait until this is out on DVD!  I read a few bad reviews before I went to see it but it exceeded my expectations.  I don't know what these critics are on.  This is an amazing movie!  My wife and I both agreed that this is the best in the series.  Definately worth the wait.  So what are you waiting for.... go see this movie!!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Every Rush fan in the world anxiously awaits the day they release a new album and launch another tour. It's been quite a few years since they released their last album \\"Vapor Trails\\" (not counting their 2004 cover album \\"Feedback\\" which was great) and on May 1, they released <br />\\"Snakes & Arrows\\" their oddly titled new album. If you're expecting a great album when buying this, I got great news: You will not be disappointed. This album is awesome! There is not a bad song on the thing. Every song deserves a 4 out of 5 or 5 out of 5. In fact, there's only two songs that get a 4/5 in my opinion. From the opening track \\"Far Cry\\" to the final track \\"We Hold On,\\" this album is SO good. You always hear The Rolling Stones getting press for still rocking at 60, but lets take a good, close look at Rush for a moment. They've been making music since the early '70s and have put out a lot of albums (I can't think of the exact number right now, but I know it's pushing 20 or is right around there)...They have the best drummer ever, one of the best bass players ever, ditto about the guitarist; drummer Neil Peart's lyrics put him in the top 10 lyricists of all time, he's arguably the greatest of them. Their music is so varied, due in part to the maturing of Geddy's voice of the years from it's original high screetch to it's controlled, high-pitching melodic singing. Rush is and remains one of the best bands of all time. For a band to be in the biz this long and put out an album this great is almost unthinkable. The best song on this album in my opinion is \\"Armor & Sword,\\" which is catchy and incredible. Out of the 3 instrumentals on the album, the best is \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" which is a narcisstic track but it works great. The guitar, bass, and drum parts all show just how talented the three are. The worst songs on the album are \\"Spindrift\\" and \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" and even those are quite good. Rush fans! Do not hesitate, purchase this album right now! Rush fans, convince people who have never heard of Rush to buy it. 30+ years later, Rush are at the top of their game and have not only released one of the best albums of their careers, but also one of the best albums of 2007. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
075640407X|4.0|Oustanding fantasy novel. His world reeks of verisimilitude, which is oftentimes the hardest thing to achieve in a fantasy world, a world that is which, by definition, is fictional.<br /><br />I really wanted to give the book five stars, but had to settle for four. I'm not really happy giving four stars, mind you, since I liked the book enough to basically read it nonstop until I finished it, but there were enough little things that kind of added up to bother me:<br />1) The intro was too long. The story really starts on page 55.<br />2) There's a bit too much repetition in the story. The narrators says, \\"And that's how I like to remember them now\\" several times, and the same events happen over and over in his attempts at romance towards the Girl.<br />3) A bit too heavy use of foreshadowing... it seems like every chapter ends, \\"Oh, but those happy times were soon to end in tragedy.\\"<br />4) The plot is interesting, but it doesn't cover a lot of ground once the story leaves his early childhood.<br /><br />Reading the above, it might like I didn't like the book. But the contrary is true. It's a great book, and I'll snap up the second and third ones whenever they come out. It's the best fantasy novel I've read in a couple years, and I read a lot of books in the genre. While I did wish it had gotten trimmed down a little more by the editor, with more things happening in those same pages, overall there is no better way to describe the book other than \\"outstanding\\".
B000005RTQ|3.0|Crusader is one of Saxon's best songs but this<br />album isn't one of their best. the production<br />and mix is horrible. I've listen to this a few<br />times and I just can't get into it and I'm a<br />big fan! I don't know what it is. Other than<br />Little Bit of What You Fancy and Just Let Me<br />Rock I don't hear anything else that stands out.<br />Some others seem to love it so.... maybe it has<br />something. Saxon is one of the best metal bands<br />of all time and it's still better than the [...]<br />that was out at the time and out now!

B00005JPFH|5.0|Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally found a balance between his life as Spider-Man and another with his long-time girlfriend M.J. Watson (Kirsten Dunst). However, his former long-time friend Harry Osbourne (James Franco), is still upset after finding out that Peter killed his father (Willem Dafoe), and donning his father's Goblin outfits, he plans to do anything possible to see him reduced to patheticness. Of course, Peter recently found out the real man behind his Uncle Ben's (Cliff Robertson) death: ex-con Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who was recently involved in an experiment gone wrong, and has become the Sandman. And a symbiote from space has infected Peter, turning him into an arrogant, overly confident punk who gets frisky with the New York captain's (James Cromwell) daughter Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and embarasses co-worker Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) to the point of revenge. Eventually, a bit from the symbiote has also turned Eddie into the monstrous Venom. So Peter must make up with M.J., quench Harry's thirst for revenge, stop the symbiote from taking over, and discover why Marko killed Ben. <br /> <br />Right up there with Bryan Singer's \\"X-Men\\", the \\"Spider-Man\\" movies have been the epitome of superhero movies since it started. Throwing in high-quality acting talent, a twisted sense of humor (from the likes of J.K. Simmons as arrogant Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell playing different roles), affecting drama, slick special effects, and slam-bang action, director Sam Raimi has created a treat for the eyes and the heart that would lead up to \\"Spider-Man 3\\". In work since \\"Spider-Man 2\\", this is Raimi's most ambitious, expensive (the budget comes in at a whopping $250 million) project. And the wait was worth it. <br /> <br />It's also long. Clocking in at two hours AND thirty minutes, \\"SM3\\" is loaded with everything. Raimi includes another batch of villains to the process, which include New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom,with aliases of misunderstood chums (Harry Osbourne is filled with passion to kill Peter Parker/Spider-Man, whom he believes to be his father's killer; Flint Marko is an ex-con who does whatever it takes to help his ailing daughter, even though his wife totally despises him; Eddie Brock is upset at Peter Parker for exposing him of a fraud, and a symbiote from Peter's suit turns him into the maniacal Venom). Raimi doesn't mind letting the viewer care for them, even though they're doing awful things (the Marko subplot is the most effective). <br /> <br />Of course, he throws in a bunch of useless subplots. The revealing of Marko as the man who killed Uncle Ben, while weaving into the story, doesn't seem satisfactory. The Gwen Stacy subplot seems like an attempt of soap opera ridiculousness, something that the series knew well of steering clear from. And Mary Jane Watson still has no luck keeping a job (this whole subplot is getting old fast, even though Dunst manages to leave with a shred of dignity thanks to some effective line-readings). It seems like Raimi was afraid that his iconic franchise might come to an end (which it fitfully does), considering rumors going about, that he decided to throw everything but the kitch sink. Sharp line readings and good story-telling aside, maybe they should've saved some of that stuff for the recent video game adaptation. <br /> <br />As usual, star Tobey Maguire is sharp and intense as he's ever been. With Peter Parker faced with alot of drama in his life - losing M.J., turning into an egomaniac that would put Tom Cruise to shame, and fighting off his enemies - the actor helps all of Parker's actions ring true. While he does overplay his hand with a dose of weepy scenes, that doesn't mean he continues sharing great chemistry with co-star Dunst (who still works her magic, but that ain't no surpris). <br /> <br />The rest of the cast fares well. James Franco, coming off a series of bombs (\\"Annapolis\\", \\"Flyboys\\", and \\"Tristan & Isolde\\"), reclaims his powerful, brooding performance as Harry. Topher Grace, J.K. Simmons, and Bruce Campbell (now playing a French waiter) provide plenty of comic relief in their roles. Thomas Haden Church, known for playing the cocky friend of Paul Giamatti's character in \\"Sideways\\", is affecting in his role as an ex-con who may or may not have purposely killed Uncle Ben. Other memorable performances also come from smaller roles played by Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brandt) and Bill Nunn (Robbie) among others. <br /> <br />I'll go out on a limb here and say that \\"SM3\\" is a delgiht. The film ends on a note that the trilogy has come full circle, which probably explains why so many characters and subplots have been added. If so, hat's off to Raimi for making one of the best comic book movies of all time.
B00004DTLJ|4.0|Saxon's no excuse was one of the best they made<br /><br />during the 80's. The songs and the production are<br /><br />excellent. Songs like Devil Rides Out, Everybody Up,<br /><br />Rock n' Roll Gypsy are catchy rockers and of course<br /><br />the brilliant Broken Heroes! It was the 4th Saxon Lp<br /><br />I bought at the time. it's one of my favorites. I lost<br /><br />touch with them in the early 90's but then Dogs of WAr<br /><br />got me into the newer stuff. The new Lp Inner Sanctum<br /><br />is one of the best they ever made! If you are into them<br /><br />or not I recommend this and the new LP. If you don't have<br /><br />Eagle has landed you aren't a true rock fan! get them now!
B000GFLAI0|3.0|Probably the best of Dylan's latter-day albums, Modern Times sees him in fine voice (or, rather, his voice has found a comfortable niche for its diminishing range).  It's a low-key effort, laid back, bluesy, and rootsy, and it's quite an achievement: I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|I loved the beginning of this movie - great stunts - but then it goes downhill from there.
B00006879E|5.0|This album has become classic. Every song is great. They will never put out an album as good as this one.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|If you have been a true Rush fan for a long time, then you understand that this group is not going to give you growling blues/rock tunes on every album.  They guys are true artists, and their work has evolved with every album since the beginning.  Some listeners may not like it, or expect the new album to contain super hits like Freewill or Spirit of Radio.  Those to me are like a painter's great work, and painters make lots of pictures. Contrary to what some other reviewers said, I love Armour and Sword, I think its the best track on the album.  Faithless is another awesome track.  Yes, things have evolved, ie.more acoustic guitar on the album among other things.  I personally love guitar leads, especially Lifeson's past work on Rush albums.  Does this album have alot of leads, aka.. a Freewill type of blast?  No. Alex's leads, like they have been lately are sublime.  But it is truly great work.  Try to play it yourself and you'll see he's a genius.  Neil's lyrics are better than ever, all I can say is he seems deeper than I ever imagined.  Geddy's work on the album is great, as always.  Five stars to this baby, can't wait for the tour.
B00005JPFF|5.0|Now i must say that i really don't honestly care if some people had a \\"hard time dealing\\" with the fact that so much was put into this movie, but i will comment. I managed to be lucky enough to see it 7pm YESTERDAY, and i thought it was/IS excellent. But i must point out that i ACTUALLY WATCHED the actors and LISTENED to them...apparently not many of the other reviewers here did. If you'd quit b1tch1ng about it being \\"too much in too little time\\" and actually SIT BACK and ENJOY it...oh wait...apparently sitting back is only to nitpick at the movie. OK, so they changed around some things from the comics (i personally quickly got over my doubts before the movie's main fight scenes started). Why does everyone have such a damn hard time enjoying a movie that combines different aspects into one (drama, comedy (which seemed really well-worked out especially), action, and...sci-fi of course (to a degree)? BOTTOM LINE: see it or not...don't let a larger cast of characters spook you from seeing this movie...think about it...THE CORE CHARACTERS that have the most \\"screen time\\" are Harry, Mary Jane, and Peter: what better way to shake them all up by adding more people into \\"their world?\\"
B00005JPFO|3.0|Nicolas Cage stars as Johny Blaze who as a teenager makes a deal with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to cure his father's cancer. He cures his cancer but never promises that he wouldn't die some other way...Johny then takes off and leaves his g/f behind. He continues as a professional stuntman in his father's footsteps. Eva Mendes \\"his former g/f\\" re-enters his life and she's now a reporter. He wants to get back into her life but he never makes it to their date because Mephistopheles also re-enters his life and he him to be his new bounty hunter. He turns him into a skull faced monster who can punish sinners. Cage has no control of his actions when he is the Ghostrider and automatically has to go head to head with Mephistopheles' son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wants to become stronger than Mephistopheles. So he wants Ghostrider to stop him and his other demon followers.<br /><br />  But Blaze learns to control his new powers and wants to use them for good. A mysterious grave digger (Sam Elliot) knows all about what is going on and wants to help Blaze learn how to handle his new powers. The effects are decent and the look of the film is good. Nicolas Cage who was supposed to play Superman like 10 yrs ago shows that he's surprisingly good in a comic book movie. He's actually the best thing about the movie. Peter Fonda is also good as Mephistopheles or I guess you can just call him the Devil. He's cool in the movie and it would've been nice to see more of him instead of the slightly annoying Bentley. Donal Logue (Blade, Grounded for Life) adds some humor as Blaze's trainer but he's not really used enough either. Sam Elliot also gives one of the better performances in the movie.<br /><br />  It's not really performances that hold this movie back from being great. Director Mark Steven Johnson handles the beginning of the movie just like he did with Daredevil. Although the father in Daredevil was developed better and we cared about his relationship with his son. We barely even see the dad enough here to learn to care about his fate. A lot of this movie just feels like one scene clunked onto another and another. It has it's fun parts but it would've been better if the movie wasn't done sorta sloppy. It can feel like Johnson is directing it with his eyes close. I think he did a much better job with the under-rated Daredevil. This movie has it's entertaining parts and Cage is super cool in the movie as are a lot of the supporting actors. But I had to remind myself that I even seen the movie. It's good looking and cool yet it is still pretty forgettable as well.even see the dad enough here to learn to care about his fate.

B000002HPV|5.0|Coming into the new world that Bjork is. I was very impressed to find myself with probably one the best CD's that I own in my collection. For years, I have thought that Bjork's music was nothing but weird \\"stuff\\". \\"Stuff\\" that I never thought was going to be as deep as it is.     I can clearly say that \\"Homogenic' is not an easy record. It's not easily likeable, and will not suit your ear on the first listen. This off course those not mean that the CD is not worth a listen, it means that this music is so \\"out there\\", so experimental, that your ears wont be able to handle it on a first time bases.     \\"Homogenic\\" it's the combination of passion, hatred, love and feelings that come from the inside. The album starts of with three lead singles \\"Hunter\\", \\"Joga\\" and \\"Bachelorette\\". Hardcore song. Bjorks roars \\"I am a hunter/I'm going hunting\\", claims that she loves to be in \\"state of emergency\\" and demonstrate her pain after her hurtful breakdown of her relationship. (I'm a whisper in water/secret for you to hear/you are the one who grows distant/ when I beckon you near.) The record also finishes with the other two highlights \\"Alarm Call\\" and \\"All Is Full Of Love\\", probably being one of my favorites. Even thought the album might come as intense, it has its up beat songs: \\"Pluto\\", \\"Immature\\" and \\"5 Years\\". Not necessarily upbeat, but definitely have a strong musical arrangements.    It is no question that Bork plays with lyrics, more than ever before. They are more in depth--not that they ever weren't--, more playful and more full of live. In \\"5 Years\\" she sings \\"I'm tired of cowards/that say they want/but they cant handle love/ it's obvious\\".    It is no question that Bjork plays with instrument. This is no \\"Post\\" or \\"Debut\\" it is the growth of a musician, no fears, full risks, and passion for music, cause without passion, neither music nor love, like proved in this record, can survive.
B00005JPFH|4.0|Spiderman 3 isn't as good as part 1 and 2 but it has pleanty of good moments for me to recommend it. It's missing something that the others had. It seems like it has a different screen-writer and I also missed Danny Elfman. When the film was being filmed I remember reading something about him actually never wanting to work with Sam Raimi again for some reason. So he's not back even if you do hear some of his original score here and there. I also think the story is sort of a mess, too much happening it once. It's sorta messy. I read the novel based on the movie before the movie came out and it's surprisingly more solid in some cases. I mean the stuff with the Sandman is better done in it and we understand him a bit more. The screenplay itself isn't developed well. It has it's scenes of emotion that do work but most of them come at the end.<br /><br />  Yes we have scenes with crying and argueing but that can be more annoying than it's entertaining. Kirsten Dunst for instance, she rarely smiles in this movie! She just accuses Peter of stuff through-out and whines about her acting career. Oh of course she gets taken by the bad guys once again too. Bryce Dallas Howard looks her best ever! as Gwen Stacey and she's not even developed much. She's just around to make Mary Jane jealous but the film could've used more of her. She's fresh to the movies and at least is happy and doesn't complain. Plus James Cromwell (Babe) is a great actor but he's pretty wasted as well as Captain Stacy, Gwen's father.<br /><br />  People complained that Topher Grace wasn't built enough to play Eddie Brock. Yes he's mis-casted but that's in style these days, I mean you have Heath Ledger playing Joker in the next Batman film for god's sake. I think Topher does a fine job even if I do think he would've been a great Spiderman if Tobey didn't come back. Through most the movie he has nothing to do but run around with a camera. When he becomes Venom he's awesome and Venom is awesome but he's not in the film enough. When you have 3 villians, Venom should of course take up most of the movie but he doesn't. We have Peter wearing the costume through a lot of the movie and when he does his hair turns black but no one even mentions once how odd it is that his hair keeps turning color back and forth. Anyway I guess that's not that important lol. The black costume is mostly used to show how Peter lets hate take over him and how it's not good to let hate take over. I would've preferred more of Eddie Brock as Venom though.<br /><br />  The film has a lot of too many simple flaws. We're supposed to believe that the Sandman just does bad stuff for his daughter. Yet the script just has him looking at her pic all the time and she's not used the way she is in the novel based on the movie. The Sandman's emotional scene in the end just sorta comes out of nowhere. It was actually done better in the book  since you had the daughter involved. Plus you also had a part in the book where he turns into a sand castle for his daughter. The movie could've used that too. Instead he never gets to have as big of a presence as the Green Goblin or Doc Ock. Plus like I said, I liked Topher Grace as Eddie Brock but he wasn't used enough either. But unlike in the book it's never explained why he knows stuff about Peter and Spiderman now that he has the stuff on.<br /><br />  I admit that the Harry Osborne stuff isn't done that bad though. Eventhough he has memory loss through most the movie and forgets that he blames Peter for his father's death. I've seen too much convenient memory loss in Smallville to wanna see it in Spiderman too lol. But I think the drama involving him is one of the stronger things the movie has going for it. Tobey Maguire is a good actor but in some scenes he didn't even look like he got in shape for the movie. I mean people have knocked Topher's built but he even looked in better shape. Tobey looked so bad in some scenes that I feared for his health. He has some scenes that he's really good and some that his heart barely seems like it's into the movie. Kirsten Dunst seems like her heart is barely into as well. Still though unlike 2 critics on Ebert & Roeper I can't just give the film a careless thumbs down! It's not the best, but it's just not a bad movie either. It's at least a better 3rd movie than X-3 was. But Sam Raimi maybe needs to read more of the comics and try to get his head back in the game because he barely seemed like he was there this time around as well.at he's really good and some that his heart barely seems like it's into the movie.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Well, after one listen, I realized that this album is special. Vapor Trails was great , especially because we thought we had lost Rush forever after personal tragedies. This album reflects their renewed sense of moving forward into new terrain. Geddy's voice sounds beautiful. Alex's guitar is fresh, and of course Neil is always a pleasure to listen to. I've been a Rush fan since 1980 and they don't sound tired or boring as some of you have put it. Actually, quite the opposite. If you are a real rush fan, but expect the unexpected from them, then this is an album to buy. Actually, anybody who likes music with genuine feeling behind it should buy this. Every time I go to a store to buy a new Rush album, the cash monkey tells me \\" Oh! This isn't as good as Moving Pictures!\\"  Again, if you expect that, then you won't like Snakes and Arrows. Move on people! Get with the program ya'll! Grow up! Grow down! Stop talking to yourself and go buy this album! NOW!!!!! THanks for agreeing with me, because you know I'm right! RUSH 2007--- See ya'll fro an EVENING WITH RUSH IN ATLANTA! Booooooooaaaaaa!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I've got lots of old Elton on vinyl (yes, I'm old) and was delighted to find 37 Elton tunes on CD for such a great price.  This is a wonderful collection with some newer songs I didn't have.  And I can play them in the car! (vinyl is not so good for that).
B00005JPD0|2.0|I often will have a willing suspension of disbelief in films just for entertainment, but this puts that willingness to the limits. I love thew sci-fi principle of time travel in this film... what I have a problem with is the tremendously flawed logic that the characters have. The chief flaw is the centering on a single character, played by Denzel Washington of course, to thwart a horrific terrorist attack. If any normal person were put in a similar situation as these supposed geniuses, they'd take much more obvious... much more logical decisions. Such ridiculous plot devices are a bit hard to swallow, despite how well crafted the movie may be.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|The dream couple of opera along with Placido Domingo provide many highlights in this well filmed concert from Berlin to celebrate the closing of the Soccer World Cup. I do agree with many of the reviewers that Domingo's diction is exemplary, compared with the new kids on the block. However, I must confess slight disappointment that none of the reviewers make mention that Domingo transposes most of his solo arias than what is originally written, which I am sure is to be expected, given the fact that he was 65 at the time of the recording. <br />However, Anna and Rolando's performances are incredible. Each aria or duet is sung with such passion and fervour. Highlights are definitely Rolando's 'La Danza' which gets the audience clapping and up on their feet and Anna's 'Quando m'en vo', where she also surprises the audience. Watch the DVD and see what I mean. Reservations aside, this is a classy concert, excellently filmed and the enormous audience of over 12 000 people enjoy every minute. Conductor Marco Armiliato and the Orchestra of the Deutsche Oper provide warm and sympathetic accompaniment to the star singers.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  You watch it expecting to see the XMen do something cool - something fitting with the plot and characters set up in the first two movies.  Instead, you're abused by a three hour long foray into bad acting, horrible dialogue, and the quick and pathetic destruction of just about everything that made the first two movies great.  Do yourself a favor and forget this movie ever happened.  I gave this movie 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option.  I'd say it was the worst movie ever, but I already gave Matrix Revolutions that distinction, so let's say this is the second worst ever, or the worst movie to end a trilogy after an amazingly good first two films.
B000LC55F2|3.0|The Prestige just didn't live up to its hype. The cinematography was wonderful, but the twists were dull and expected. I recommend watching the Illusionist instead.
B000O1799U|5.0|This movie based of a brodway play was supposedly lossely based on the story of the supremes. Also a little triva fact one of the actress in this movie I belive it was Jeenifer Hudson prior to this movie was a participent in on of the episode of the previous seasons of American Idol but she got voted off the show mid way through the season. This tells the phonimal story of three singer known as the dreams and the troubles and hardships the face from there beginning in the mid 1960s and to there final concert in mid 70 or early eigites the precise years aren't told all the time unlike in ray. If you enjoyed ray you'll love this movie. A word of warning like ray this movie has occasional drugs use mild sexuality scenes occasionally and occasional inappropriate word thrown in. As a result this movie might not be appropriate or maybe questionable to kids under the age of thirteen depending on what there parents our guardian think is appropriate for them. If you like this movie I also recommend the movie ray which celebrates I belive its third or fourth anniversary this year. Try to buy this in like new condition because if you try to get this used online in new condition it may be over 30 dollars for some copies because this dvd brand new it was just released in stories for sale and for rent about three days ago.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Strange as it seems, the last \\"proper\\" Rush record arguably was 1997's Test for Echo. Well what about 2002's Vapor Trails? Well, weird thing about that record is that people almost couldn't get into it that much with much of the blame placed on its production which sounded just noisy. There was bright spots and feelings of classic Rush but it was marred by fuzzy guitars and just an overwhelming sense of dirtyness throughout and a lack of trademark Rush interplay with a bigger emphasis on loud, distorted guitars instead of mixing it up (such as Limelight or the all-clean Time Stand Still). Snakes & Arrows though is a return to a kind of sound that we all miss and while there's not really any pop smash a la Tom Sawyer, it's still an enjoyable record. <br /> <br />Far Cry: First single and another top notch opener since they rarely disappoint starting their records. Big riffs and chords, this whole record feels like Rush circa Counterparts and this would've fit right along there. Weird solo though. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Armor and Sword: Seems like an epic in the vein of Natural Science or Jacob's Ladder. Great intro with a neat riff involving chords, harmonics and arpeggios. It drags ever so slightly since it kind of just keeps going without a change in the musicianship like Xanadu did but oh well. 9/10 <br /> <br />Workin' Them Angels: Remember people said Peaceable Kingdom sounded like Half the World? This reminds me of that too but it's still a likable track and is another one of the upbeat, catchy tracks. Originally I didn't like it (chorus, mainly) but it grew on me. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />The Larger Bowl: It's quite an accessible track and radio could potentially embrace it if it's a single with an radio friendly hook but strangely, I wasn't a big fan of it. Maybe it just needs to grow on me more. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Spindrift: Eerie arpeggios start the track before delving into an evil, onimous riff and the whole thing has a very compelling feeling to it. Reminds meof Witch Hunt or Double Agent in its tone. A very grandiose rocker. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />The Main Monkey Business: Possibly to make up for the lack of an instrumental on Vapor Trails, this is the first of 3. While it won't send guitarists to the woodshop like YYZ did, this is probably their best instrumental in years. Many changes and great interplay including some synth backing, this is an album highlight. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />The Way the Wind Blows: Even though it's a bit more rockier and blues-y, it always reminds me of a more faster Nobody's Hero or Resist. It's also one of the album's greater songs with a fast tempo and an anthemic chorus. If you want to test the waters, this is a good track to listen to first. 9/10 <br /> <br />Hope: Now this will either scare away or get guitarists ramped up. A Middle-Eastern flavored instrumental acoustic piece courtesy of \\"Lerxst Lifeson\\", it's nice to listen to but other than guitarists, most will probably skip it. 8/10 <br /> <br />Faithless: The record as a whole has the theme of faith in things and what can change it and this song is like the basic idea of that. Musically though, a mid-tempo number with plenty of progness going on,  it's alright but again, it didn't catch me on first listen and after a few, it still hasn't. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Bravest Face: I'm not a big fan of the verses but everything else works perfectly. Many musical changes from acoustics to patented Lifeson arpeggios and a great chorus, this is one of those songs on the record where you'll keep coming back to it as you keep listening. 9/10 <br /> <br />Good News First: Musically, it's actually quite an interesting listen. It's just the rest of it as a song works at times but not consistently. It seems to be a song that almost lacks a strong enough hook which many Rush songs usually have. 7/10 <br /> <br />Malignant Narcissism: The title (which has shades of \\"an exercise in self-indulgence\\" that La Villa Strangiato had, is taken from Team America: World Police and even appears in the song itself. The last of the instrumentals and is probably the more straightforward of them, like Where's My Thing. Geddy Lee is all over the place with his bass here. 9/10 <br /> <br />We Hold On: Like Everyday Glory, it ends the record on a kind of uplifting note. It's not quite fullblown optimism, just a more hopeful one. It's also one of the more likable songs on the record and in a warped world, could even be a song radio could embrace but since they always look for Tom Sawyer part II, it wouldn't do anything which is too bad. 9/10 <br /> <br />I think people by now know they're not going to do another Moving Pictures or Permanent Waves. Whereas those albums had more a feeling of songs intended to be chockful of hooks, these are more slow burner songs that eventually get into your head. A good handful from here will get into your head and it's nice to see the production lend itself to the songs.
B000059XUI|5.0|I really got into this Superman movie when it came out 25 years ago. It has all the excitement, action and thrills fans have expected through these years. Wonderful performances by Christopher Reeve and Terence Stamp! This movie rocks!!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|man what a terrible dysfunctional film. i myself weightlift am strong and mentally sound but dam i left seeing this film started to doubt myself and very angry. the way this snuff film the torture seen pull the eyeball of the victim out whats up with that, i mean we all know people sell their assess but sell them for a torture club hell no. the film was made in a way to inspire anger in civil audience types or idealist such as myself. i am completely jaded. when you see this film see it with a counselor and friends and make sure when you see it all your friends are strong and viable or packing because when you leave seeing this film you dont want to see any weakness around you thats how much anger this film brought out its like so negative and somehow jades you momentarily. i mean if the god dam aliens landed right now there would be no response from me because i felt after seeing this film i seen the abyss whats next.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The best thing about this movie are the opening credits! When I saw this movie nearly 30 years ago I was awe struck at the opening. The movie is first rate with first rate performances by Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder and of course Christopher Reeve.I enjoyed Superman I and II but didn't really care for the two other Superman movies. Don't get me wrong..Christopher Reeve is a wonderful actor and we miss him but the last two didn't have much of a plot. Superman I was and still is good high flying fun for everyone!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is 2007 and Rush has moved on, maybe some of us should as well. As I will always hold 2112 and A Farwell to Kings in the highest regard possible, I never expected Rush to play that type of music forever, writing and singing about dragons and castles, that's why they're progressive. Snakes & Arrows is the latest installment of this phase and I'm ranking it up there with Power Windows and Moving Pictures. Starting with the title, you should know this is a different Rush album. I'll say that I liked it upon the first play and have listened to it all the way through each time, no hitting the skip button on this one. Neil, Alex and Ged have more that enough musicianship on their own. Add to that Neil's words and put it all together for a combination that's far better than just about anything else out there in the rock spectrum.  <br /> <br />When \\"Far Cry\\" opens you know this disc rocks. I think that one of the first impressions is that Geddy's voice sounds great. It's smooth, emotional and full of fitting expression for each lyric, line and song, reaching beauty at some points. So he's not shrieking like days of old, he doesn't need to. And he's 30 some years older, give the guy a break. He still sounds damn good! <br /> <br />There is a lot of music on this record. At first it may seem like a bit too much but after repeated listening you realize that there's not really a wasted note and there's more to it than space filler. Ged takes it one step further in that on Vapor Trails he laid down solid lines with an occasional flourish but here he just spreads the jam evenly over the entire record. Neil plays so many drums that you'll miss most of them on the first couple of listens. The man is amazing and may be pulling out relics from the \\"Kings\\" days just to have more things to hit. I think he'll have 3 drum risers and rubber arms installed for this tour. And Alex is back baby! On the last few records it doesn't seem he's pushed himself as hard as he could but he's exploded like a time bomb. With great backing rhythms, plenty of leads in varying styles and very nice acoustic work spread over the whole recording, Alex again shows while he's one of the best guitarists in the biz today. <br /> <br />I like that there are 3 instrumentals on this disc and think all of them are good, with \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" being the best. As with other bands, I've thought about (dreamed) Rush releasing an instrumental only album and these songs are great examples of what they can do. <br /> <br />The lyrical subject can seem to get a bit tiring since the concept doesn't change much from song to song. The idea that a more global understanding and communications is needed along with less war and forced politics isn't really that different from 2112, Power Windows and several other Rush songs. Neil did state on his web site and in interviews what his inspirations for these songs would be so there shouldn't be a big surprise. At times being criticized in the past for writing from an observational point of view and then for being too personal on Vapor Trails he successfully combines the two here. Most of the lyrics can be easily taken on a personal, social, global, political and universal level, all at once. Like most writers he probably isn't trying to match our point of view although he does hit home occasionally. <br /> <br />The lyrics, along with the rest of the disc, are representive of balance. As they paint a bleak of world they also offer hope and change that begins with us. As Gandhi said \\"Be the change that you want to see in the world\\". Musically you can hear the exact contributions of each of these guys. There is no heavy leaning in any direction. They all jam all the way through. The production is also balanced between Raskulinecz and the band. There's as much of the \\"new sound of Rush\\" here (I can't recall any of their songs that sound like \\"Workin' them Angels\\") as there are echoes of the past.  <br /> <br />This has possibly created the most accessible Rush record to date. A first time listener, casual fan or someone who may not have cared for them in the past could find something they like in this offering. Not as radio friendly as Moving Pictures may have been, there is definitely potential for this recording to cast a wide net.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This year marks 50 years since this Broadway classic opened to enthusiastic reviews. In 1961..the movie version did the same magical thing. What a great cast, a great story and to sum up this is the musical that gets better every time you see it. It is a movie that has stood the test of time. I am a big fan of Rita Moreno not only for her role in West Side Story but for her role in The Electric Company! If you want a movie that dances, that sings, that has its dramatic and fun moments,WEST SIDE STORY is for you!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Jewish traditions and believes are portrayed throughout the movie. Soldiers in history would have beaten the prisoners the very way Gibson presented, I believe it was called \\"bloodlust.\\" It was horribly graphic. I would not recommend showing to small children. This movie has definately made my faith stronger! Highly recommended! Also highly recommended \\"The Nativity Story.\\"
B00005JPFF|4.0|While I may not have the credibility of some of the other reviewers listed (this is the 1st review I've ever done for ANYTHING) I do know what I like (The Spidey Series, X-men Series, and Blade 1 and 2) and dislike (Daredevil, Ghost Rider and Friggin Cat Woman, OH. MY. GOD.). <br /> <br />    With the amount of character content that was introduced in this latest installment, I think Sam Raimi did an outstanding job. He gave the fans exactly what they had been looking and asking for. Of course, any one of the villains this time out could have had their own Spidey film (and perhaps should have) but again, the fans had spoken and to me, it was handled marvelously.  <br /> <br />    The character and story progression was handled very well. The action was just what you've come to expect from Raimi (and he didn't disappoint!)and the pacing was just enough that I didn't find myself restless at anytime due to the length of the film. I think that Raimi presented us with one of the truest presentations of comic-to-film adaptations possible, and no one can take that away from him (THE most true to date - TO ME - was SIN CITY, Rodriguez just dumped the film straight from the comic to the screen with that one). I loved the Goblin upgrade. I loved the Sandman CGI and battle sequences with our hero. I loved Venom (although, admittedly, wished that there could have been more time with him) and the over-all satisfaction and relief I felt after 1st hearing that there was even going to BE an S3 (you kind of get a little worried about sequel disappointment - \\"awww maaann, they should have stopped at 2\\" Blade 3 anyone?).  <br /> <br />    Of course it was far from a flawless film but the things that I would pick on that I didn't like would probably be glossed over by someone else (I LIKED the little dance number Peter had and the Travolta, 'Saturday Night Fever' shout out Raimi added)so I won't bore you with what I felt were shortcomings and let you make your own decisions.  <br /> <br />   What it boils down to is Yeah, I'd recommend this film to my pickiest friends with a cheese eating grin on my face and two thumbs way the heck up. I could get into some of the other unfolding story and character points but honestly feel that you'd like to see what they are for yourself (and hope you won't think me a sucky reviewer after seeing it). Go. There's nothing stopping you...
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an absolute MUST buy! You'll be glued to your sets as you're transported to a variety of remote locations, rare animals and never-before-seen behavior.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Like many others, I highly anticipated the release of this album. In the latest edition of \\"Guitar One\\", guitar hero Alex Lifeson was interviewed on Rush's latest, \\"Snakes and Arrows\\". During the interview, he said that because he gets bored very easily, he wants to experiment with new tones that will inspire him. The different guitar tones, among lyrics and overall songwriting, do add different textures to \\"Snakes and Arrows\\". When I read that Rush was \\"going retro\\" on this album, I automatically pictured the \\"2112\\" album, but I guess my assumption was too obvious. However, this is a strong album altogether and should prove a nice addition to your collection. <br />The album in general reminds me a bit of Dream Theater, which, in my opinion, is a great thing. The beautiful, two-minute, acoustic piece, \\"Hope\\", performed solely by Alex Lifeson, is a wonderful piece, and due to his performance and the DADAAD tuning makes it sound a lot like a Led Zeppelin folk instrumental. \\"Malignant Narcissism\\", the other, two-minute instrumental, sounds like sped-up Black Sabbath with some dirty, alternative-rock textures. <br />On \\"Bravest Face\\", there's a brief, clean-blues tone that reminds me somewhat of Stevie Ray Vaughan and there's a reoccuring, yet not main, jazz riff in \\"Good News First\\" that kind of reminds me of a sped-up version of the riff in Peter Frampton's \\"Do You Feel Like We Do?\\". Neil Peart's drumming is spirited and energetic here; the music doesn't focus so much on his drumwork as earlier releases, but he proves that after all these years, he's still got talent and passion. <br />The lyrics here are interesting, too, opposite completely to storytelling epics such as \\"2112\\" or \\"Hemispheres\\". However, they add a lot of meaning to the songs and paint a picture of what Rush is telling. The art within the booklet adds to the description behind each song, so it helps to view the pictures and read along as you listen. At least, that's what I did, and it worked quite well for me. <br />Geddy Lee's basswork is present here, too and his voice is as vibrant and youthful as it was on Rush's debut (which, IMO, is an underrated album). Anyway, he delivers the lyrics with his signature style and it never wears thin. From the Pearl Jam-esque anthemic lyrics in \\"Bravest Face\\" to the self-assuring words in \\"Faithless\\", his voice carries Peart's words throughout. <br />Alex Lifeson's guitar work, as I previously got started on, is probably the key element on this album. None of the songs make me automatically think of the openings on \\"A Passage To Bangkok\\" or \\"The Trees\\", but Lifeson proves right from the start that anything he can think up, he can play, and excel at doing so. <br />The album as a whole is mystical and murky, diverse and delightful, and, at least to me, goes to show that Rush doesn't miss a trick. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I hope you can buy a copy before the stores rocket the price up to eighteen bucks (the regular amount for a new album). Anyway, thanks, Rush, can't wait to see you on tour this summer! <br />Peace!
0151012768|1.0|I found 'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen' a huge disappointment. The characters are limp, the plot insipid and the writing approaches the standard of a fourth form English Literature essay. It is verbose and clumsy, rife with tautology and factual error. I ploughed on through the turgid mire in the vain hope that it would actual deliver on some sort of conclusion or scant reward but to no avail. I felt cheated that I had wasted my valuable time reading such amateurish dross. I only persevered out of duty because I am an avid fly fisherman but was left feeling all the more cheated for that very reason. How Marina Lewycka could describe this book as 'A wonderful novel\\" is beyond me. No plot, no prose, no presence and really no point. Buy 'A River Runs Through It\\". A single page of that holds more majesty than this.
B00005JPFH|5.0|Once upon a time there was a comic book company named Marvel.  It was a tiny enterprise that was struggling to stay afloat in the shadow of its huge competitor, DC.  A man named Stan Lee worked for this company.  He had a vision that one day comic books would be more than, well, comic books.  Instead of simplistic plots and one dimensional characters he imagined story lines with heroes that shared all of the foibles of regular mortals, including fear, doubt, anger, hope and internal conflict.      Stan Lee poured this vision into a person he created named Spiderman.  The character was an instant hit and showed that Lee's vision had potential.  Marvel went from being barely known to becoming the gold standard in its industry.    Spiderman 3 is the ultimate fulfillment of Lee's vision.  This movie is a true epic.  Tobey Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman with incredible acting skill.  As the superhero's popularity grows he is faced with new temptations, including the desire to misuse his powers and give in to the dark side of his nature.  This is personified in the arrival of an extra terrestrial symbiont that gives Spiderman vast new powers but also magnifies his feelings of hatred and aggression.    The lovely and immensely talented Kirsten Dunst does a fantastic job playing Mary Jane as a caring, sensitive, highly vulnerable young lady who is struggling with her own conflicts.  She becomes embroiled in the movie's climactic scene in which Spiderman must fight enemies created largely by his own misdeeds.  The result is one of the best battle scenes in motion picture history, where special effects are used to enhance and amplify the story line, not replace it.  The end is in equal parts tragic, inspiring, touching and romantic.  It explores the questions of what qualities make up a true hero as well as what motivates those who do evil.    In my opinion the large cast is not a hindrance to this film.  Rather the sizable set of characters only adds to itsepic status.    In a day where authentic heroes are desperately needed, Spiderman 3 rises to the best standards of film making.  It gives us a character that not only entertains but also encourages all of us to live to the best of our natures.  In short, this isn't just a great superhero movie.  It's a great movie, period.  If you don't see this one you'll be missing something truly special.
0810993139|5.0|Reviewed by T.J. Jones (age 13) for Reader Views (4/07)<br /><br />\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" is about a kid named Greg Heffley.  He goes through middle school as a wimpy kid.  He and his friend Rowley have many adventures together.  They deal with school, family, and friendship.  Eventually Rowley starts to grow more popular than Greg.  Greg gets jealous and worried at the same time.  He has to do anything he can to save his friendship with Rowley.  That will not be easy for Greg because he still needs to have time for his school and family.  Greg is confused and frustrated; he just has to find a way to stop all of the chaos.<br /><br />I really liked \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" because it was very funny.  It is also very true.  Middle school is not easy.  \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" is a good book for times when you are bored or just feel like laughing.  It made me feel better when I was at school.  It is from the perspective of a wimpy kid; that is what makes it so good.<br /><br />Anybody who knows a good book when they read one should definitely read \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid.\\"  There is not even an age group for this book; it is funny to anyone who reads it.  The person who might enjoy it the most would most likely be a sixth or even seventh-grader.  The library should defiantly order \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid.\\"  It is totally worth it.  I think I might even read it again sometime.<br /><br />Book received free of charge.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I actually bought 8 copies the day it came out.  Kept three and gave away the rest.  The album covers alot of music and will appeal to everyone.  I gave copies to poople in there 20's and people in their 60's.
B00005JPFH|4.0|Going into this one, I was wondering if Sam Raimi would be able to top himself in the wake of his magnus opus SPIDER-MAN 2. Bluntly, the answer is no. But, listen, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much worth dropping your hard-earned dollars for. SPIDEY 2 was a five star film, this one rates as a four starrer and remains a quintessentially fun summer blockbuster picture.<br /><br />The special effects are seamless. CG Venom and the Sandman look great, while CG Spidey continues to astound. Admittedly, I wasn't too impressed with how the Goblin looked. You really gotta hand it to Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle epic superhero battles. In various fabulous faceoffs, Spidey takes on the Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom and, each time, our hero doesn't walk away without leaving a piece of himself on the floor. Even though we knew Spidey was going to come out on top, the fight scenes are credible and effective enough that he seems to be the underdog in each encounter. I have absolutely no complaints with the Spidey sequences.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 3 is again very well served with returning supporting actors J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson (hilarious!) and the sexy Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant (more, please). Sam Raimi's buddy, Bruce Campbell, has a funny bit as a Maitre d', Mageina Tovah as the landlord's daughter brightens up the room with her endearing if skeletal presence, Stan Lee provides the obligatory cameo ('nuff said), Bryce Dallas Howard is essentially wasted as Gwen Stacy, and Rosemary Harris is the usual boring fount of wisdom.<br /><br />Folks have already mentioned the overstacking of supervillains and the onerousness of the multiple plot stories. I say, \\"Phooey\\" to that. I was able to track every story arc with ease and keep up with every character. In my opinion, the villains are drawn with just enough depth and are given ample back stories. By virtue of having been in every film installment, Harry Osbourne comes off as the most layered antagonist. James Franco, whom I normally dislike, is very good here. Flint Marko, aka The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), is immediately revealed to be a sympathetic character as the audience, early on, becomes privy to his core motivation. Eddie Brock (a puny and miscast Topher Grace), however, is just plain bad egg. Now, there's a chance that newcomers to the Spidey mythos might be befuddled with the abrupt introduction of the inky, wriggly alien symbiote. Furthermore, Raimi then ignores the symbiote for lengthy film moments, opting to leave it in residence at Peter's cramped apartment to bide its time. Raimi is seemingly relying on the fans' knowledge of the alien costume to carry the day in lieu of actually sketching out some sort of a backstory. Not that there's much of a backstory on it in the comic book source. SECRET WARS, anyone?<br /><br />Hands down, Spidey's my favorite superhero. Like a host of kids, of the plethora of superheroes, it's Peter Parker with whom I identified the most when I was a mere tadpole. What makes him such a rootable underdog character is that Stan Lee and the ensuing comic book writers portrayed him as a sensitive teen/young man with relatable dilemmas who ekes out small victories in life even as he trounces heinous superbaddies. This film strays away from what makes him so likable. The start of SPIDER-MAN 3 finds a smug Peter Parker as Spiderman has become the toast of New York. His image is displayed on giant monitors and he is lauded in the newspapers (excepting the Bugle, of course). He even is presented with the key to the city. This same scene also comes up with an act by Peter as Spidey which is blatantly disrespectful towards Mary Jane. In fact, the success of his Spider-Man persona blinds him to what's going on with Mary Jane, whose career isn't flowing as smoothly. Understandibly, it's not too long before M.J. begins to feel that Peter isn't there for her. Suffice it to say, while I loved every Spidey sequence, there are moments here where I genuinely did not like Peter Parker.<br /><br />Or put another way, my dissatisfaction with Peter is actually a nod towards Kirsten Dunst's very effective performance. She's easily the best actor in this film and is so likable as Mary Jane that every thoughtless act by Peter towards her exacerbated my resentment towards the dude. I'm just not kosher with plotlines necessitating my hero to act like an obtuse jerk. And, since I'm crapping on the poor guy, I must say the hairstyle he chooses when under the symbiote's influence is less than cool. If it was supposed to emphasize his dark turn, it failed miserably, and the film, in my eyes, lost some credibility. The audience, including me, burst out laughing every time that goofy downswept hairstyle popped up. Unintended laughter - it's not a good thing.<br /><br />But I want to reiterate: Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. He got me thru junior high school (middle school, to you youngsters) and high school. I hated to criticize this movie, but it would've been wrong to merely leave it as a glowing review and to ignore the warts. Yet, with its flaws, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much a sensational movie, and I do feel that, ultimately, its positives outweigh the negatives. Tobey Maguire is the definitive Peter Parker, no matter what. I can't really envision anyone else in that role. Dunst, as always, is superlative and very lovely and oozes acting talent. The complex story, in spite of hitting a few false notes, did keep me involved. The action scenes are eyepopping, nothing at all wrong with them. Sam Raimi playfully continues to throw in insane gag bits and incidental, low key humor (for some reason, I like the doorknob bit). There's even several brief dance numbers, and it's up to you to laugh and go with it or groan and grouse. Most, hopefully, will do the former.nuinely did not like Peter Parker.<br /><br />Or put another way, my dissatisfaction with Peter is actually a nod towards Kirsten Dunst's very effective performance.

B000002KIC|5.0|Quite simply The Band were one of the greatest Rock N Roll bands ever. This is a recording of their farewell concert in 1976 (at least in the classic line-up with Robbie Robertson on guitar). The Bands music on its own would merit purchase of this disc. They run through a 'best of' set, that as a concert would be hard to beat.<br /><br />Add to this the guest list, and you have one of the best rock concerts of all time. Van Morrison in his hey day belting out 'Caravan'. Joni Mitchell singing 'Coyote'. Dylan with Robbie Robertson burning incendiary guitar licks behind him. Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Neil Diamond, Neil Young, Dr John, Eric Clapton... The list goes on and on.<br /><br />A few extra numbers were recorded after the concert and these are included on the CD as well. The best of which is a magnificent version of 'The Weight' featuring The Staples singers. If you haven't heard Mavis Staples, and you like gospel influenced music this takes what was already a great song to a new level.<br /><br />The same year this was recorded Punk came on the scene and changed music for ever. But it doesn't matter whether you were brought up on Elvis Presley, The Sex Pistols, Nirvana or Coldplay, this music is as essential now as it was 31 years ago.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|All I can saw is WOW! Rush continues to evolve and transform. This isn't from the \\"old days\\" it's from today and they have a new message from their experiences to give us. I don't look for new music from Rush to sound like anything from their past. How could it? They move forward (progressive) and take today's issues and put them into notes and lyrics. I can never thank them enough for setting the example and sharing their wisdom with us. For Neil to continue on after tragedy in his life sets a grand example of a man we can respect. I'm sure deep down he quietly wonders why we look at him with such admiration. Keep up the good work guys. You're one of the bright lights showing us the proper path through the tunnel of life. Thanks.
0312360266|5.0|Zoey is a typical teen.  She deals with the angst and friendships involved with high school.  She deals with her mother's coldness and her step father's conservative nature.  She deals with the struggles of trying to figure out who she is.  And in one instant, in the middle of a school hallway, she becomes marked and her life changes forever.  As if being a teen is not enough, now Zoey must be a part of THE HOUSE OF NIGHT, a place where fledgling twins are trained to become vampyres.  One thing that Zoey realizes in her journey is that The House of Night, despite the obvious difference, is really no different than the world she left:  she still have to try to fit in, to make friends, to deal with enemies, and to find her place within the world.<br /><br />I have to say that I really enjoyed this novel.  Typically, I'm not a fan of fantasy novels, but Zoey is a character you want to follow through a story.  She's so real and honest, and you will easily find yourself right alongside her, wishing her well through the perils that she faces.  I also love the development of the other characters, characters that could have so easily been made flat and lifeless.  Another important element of this story is its action sequences.  The Casts do a wonderful job of not only make the action realistic, but supplying it in a way so that it doesn't become a heavy factor in the story; it becomes yet another great element in a story full of strong characterization and storytelling.<br /><br />I am SO looking forward to the next book in this series, and I HIGHLY recommend MARKED to not only young adults but adults as well.  If you're not so much into fantasy, still give it a chance.  At the end of the day, this is a story about a young girl trying to find her place within a crazy world:  I think all chicks can relate!
B00000ING2|4.0|Every time they set a context, it's just to defy it. It's never predictable. They'll start going in some kind of serious direction and then just make the silliest thing possible happen.  <br />The dude who has the idea for the hula hoop, he draws a circle and expects people to understand what it is, and they never ask what it is they just ignore it like they think he's retarded or something. And the reporter gal's voice is so funny because it exists completely out of context. (People who dislike this movie seem to take the accent seriously.) <br />And the old guy who gets up like he's going to the bathroom or changing a lightbulb or something, really slowly while the other twenty guys around the table watch in silence, and then runs the length of the boardroom table like a diving board and dives through the glass of the 44th floor.  <br />I think the funniest part though was when the other old dude tells Tim Robbins he's fired, but he still insists on trying to put out the fire he started in the trashcan, and he walks over to the window for some reason and the old dude thinks he's trying to leave like he told him to, and he's like \\"not that way, through the door\\". omg that was so funny.  <br />And the sequence where the hula hoop finally reaches it's popularity, some kid finds one and starts using it and a crowd of kids stare for a while then run away screaming, seemingly in horror.  <br />They don't direct your attention to a certain place and then put the joke there, they hit you with it while you're waiting for something else to happen. A lot like Sarah Silverman and her Program. It's unfortunate that comedy in film and tv has become so regimented that people often can't see a joke unless there's an indicator beforehand telling them where to look for it.
0586071113|5.0|This was a very readable Sci-fi that takes place in the far, far future when there are numerous planets inhabited by humans, called the Galactic Empire. It follows the path of Hari Seldon, a mathmetitian that came up with the idea of psychohistory, a mathmatical way to possibly predict the future. This novel is the adventure of Hari with another character sent to protect him, on the center of the Galactic Empire, the planet of Trantor. Hari and his companion find one interesting adventure after another.
B0007GFFVQ|3.0|I am a big fan of Brian Eno's early abstract work.  I like the way he took simple ideas and explored them until they became transformed into something completely different.  For example, on \\"Music for Airports\\" he recorded women singing single notes, made tape loops of varying lengths from those recordings and let them circulate until many different combinations of notes and silences emerged.  The result was beautiful and other-worldly.  So, when Eno recorded an album of \\"soundtrack material\\" (for non-existant films) it seemed that he had stumbled onto a great outlet for his music.  Instead, this is a collection of pieces that sound like floor sweepings from the \\"Another Green World\\" sessions.  The pieces are short and often sound like passing thoughts that never developed into anything of substance.  There are some nice moments on this recording, including some great bass parts and guest appearences by people like Robert Fripp but overall this is one of the weakest of Eno's early recordings.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Warning - this review contains plot spoilers.  If you haven't seen it and wat to be surprized, read no further.  Ok, this movie had some great moments and a wonderful cast, but it also had holes in the plot that you could walk a horse through.  I just don't buy that a 16 or 17 year old boy could not know he was colorblind.  And I have the same problem with how neither of the girl's parents had no inkling of what their daughter was going to do when she got onstage. How long were they working on that routine?  Who bought the rip-away costume?  And then there was the issue of handling the grandfather's remains.  I can't believe that the family would have had so few options that they would have to take their dead grandpa on the road.  Then there was the traffic cop - he saw the magazines but not the bagged cropse?  Please! There are some great moments - the boy's reaction to the shattering of his dearly held dream.  And the scene around the table during which the suicide attempt was discussed.  But all in all I don't see this as Acadamy Award material.  There was just too much story trouble that was too hard to ignore.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|This recording is a classic from Eno's early days.  He took simple ideas and explored them until they were transformed into something new.  The pieces have a lot of time to stretch out and develop.  This stuff is both relaxing and engaging.
B000GPI2EK|4.0|I will be frank, this album blew me away. The attraction? The cover. Mastodon's \\"Blood Mountain\\" album is the first metal album I've listened to and have not stopped listening at all. Unlike other bands who scream death and grotesque remarks, Mastodon keeps it going with rhythms of power and melodies unlike before, filled with fantastical references. \\"Pendulous Skin\\" is the one track that changed the way I perceived metal, and other such tracks in this album simply are unforgettable.
0743496728|4.0|This book is pretty good, especially compared to the last horrible novel, Tenth Circle, that I couldn't finish. I think the book had to be a lot longer, with so many characters running around (Peter, Lacy, Lewis, Patrick, Alex, Josie) and there really wasn't that much of a moral issue. Instead of making me ask, Hmm What should we do about school bullying?, I was just caught in the story.
B000O77RLE|5.0|...and a fantastic companion piece to \\"Flags of our Fathers\\". I actually think it's the better film between the two.<br /><br />On the surface, attempting to let U.S. audiences see the battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of the Japanese could be a tricky endeavor.<br /><br />But the director (and English dialog) quickly immerse you in the period, the patriotism and the palpable taste of the war. These guys know they are on a hopeless mission, but their never-ending pride for country keeps them going, and keeps you hooked.<br /><br />This movie is much more engaging than \\"Flags of our Fathers\\". From the beginning, you quickly start to understand the relationship between the characters, and it lures you in.<br /><br />My favorite crossroads in this movie is when the Japanese troops spy the American soldiers raising the flag at Mount Suribachi. This provides the clearest reference point to \\"Flags of our Fathers\\".<br /><br />All in all, an engaging movie that deserves to be seen in Blu-Ray HD.<br /><br />5 stars
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I LOVE Michael Buble`'s music, and his newest CD is proof that he can sing as well as Sinatra or any of the other great singers of the past!  What talent this young singer has!  It is well worth the money to purchase \\"Call Me Irresponsible!\\"  I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.  Michael WILL become a legend in the music industry!!  He is incredibly talented!
B001EOOQEM|4.0|The band enters the 80's with their new signer, Ronnie James Dio and achieved a really great rock album.  Great guitars, a loud rythm section and one of the best rock'n'roll vocalist is all you need to produce  a fisrt class rock album. That's what they did with this one.  Favorites tracks are Neon Knights, Children of the sea, Lady Evil, Heaven and Hell and Lonely is the word.
B000001F5A|5.0|I've owned this soundtrack for several years without having seen the movie it accompanied until today.  <br /> <br />The movie itself is beautiful and emotionally charged and Vangelis' stunningly melancholic score ups the emotional quotient and will have you reaching for the Kleenex once you marry the visuals with the music. <br /> <br />Enjoy the breathtaking music on this cd and beg steal or borrow the movie to get the full experience.
B00005JPEG|5.0|A great film, couldn't wait to see it as I been a Beatrix Potter fan for a long time.  The director and producer did a great job with this film. Although one area is a little dark (when she is going through her depression,)  it is still a movie that children could see, after all, it's life.  I wish more films were like Miss Potter.  I'd go every week. I can't wait to own this on DVD.
B00005JPFH|4.0|When the review of \\"Spider-Man 3\\" in our local paper came out and trashed the movie I was braced for the worse, although since there were four midnight showings on opening day it seems obvious this movie is going to make a lot of money (at least this first weekend).  But I really did think it would be nigh impossible for this 2007 film to be better than its 2004 predecessor, which is my favorite comic book movie to date (a verdict I render as someone who teaches comic books in general and Spider-Man in particular in my Introduction to Popular Culture course).  \\"Spider-Man 3\\" certainly has its flaws and it is not as good as \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" but those things do not add up to the film being a disappointment.<br /><br />For Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Spider-Man these are the best of times.  Spider-Man is beloved by the people of New York City and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) has given Peter the engagement ring that she received from Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) a half-century earlier so that he can propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  But Harry Osborn (James Franco) knows that Peter is Spider-Man, believes Spidey killed his father Norman (Willem Dafoe), and has found the secret Green Goblin hideout.  So right off the bat he comes gunning for Spider-Man.  This seems like they are trying to wrap up a loose plot thread from \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" but this is but one of the several major pieces this movie puts in place for the endgame.  Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) has broken out of jail and become the victim of one of those classic comic book situations where science turns a man into a monster, in this case the Sandman.  When Peter finds out it was Marko who actually shot Uncle Ben he takes his first step off the deep end.  Peter also has problems in that ambitious Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace) wants Peter's job as a photographer at \\"The Daily Bugle,\\" where J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Then there is Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter who gets rescued by Spider-Man and has a big old crush on the web-head, and the sticky black thing from another planet that has attached itself to our hero.  No wonder the movie runs 140 minutes.<br /><br />Director Sam Raimi pours on the special effects in the computer generated fight sequences.  What made Doctor Octopus a great villain for a Spider-Man movie was how the two could fight on both the horizontal and vertical axises.  Obviously that continues with Venom and to a lesser extent with Sandman, but what those two villains have in common is the fluidity of their \\"costume\\" and \\"body\\" respectively.  They have fun making Spider-Man's costume all torn and tattered, but that is nothing compared to what they are able to do with Sandman's face and body in these fight sequences.  When Spidey fights the New Goblin (and there is a reason Harry is not running around as the second Green Goblin), it looks more like a high-speed video game with everything happening faster than the eye can see (compare that with the great fight between Peter and Harry when they are not wearing their costumes).<br /><br />For me the problematic character is Gwen Stacy, because in the original \\"Spider-Man\\" comic books Gwen was Peter's girlfriend long before Mary Jane became his wife.  Given the relatively small number of Spider-Man movies that you can make, it made sense to skip Gwen and have Mary Jane there from the beginning, even if it meant turning her into the girl next door instead of the sexy redhead in the go-go boots.  But we now know that Peter ends up with MJ, just like we know Clark Kent ends up with Lois Lane and Bruce Wayne is never going to get married.  So Gwen's mere presence is problematic because she cannot be the woman he loves who dies because he is Spider-Man.  In the \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" comic book MJ is there from the beginning too, knowing Spider-Man's secret identity, and the integration of Gwen's character into that revision of the story was okay, but itdid not have the significance or resonance of the original storyline.  The movie Gwen is more like the comic book Mary Jane and that whole plot line would have worked better with Betty Brant (Elizabeth Banks) or an entirely new character than resurrecting Gwen Stacy.<br /><br />Besides the delicious irony that the blond Dunst has died her hair red while the redheaded Howard has gone platinum, I was bothered by how they had Gwen be a model.  Mary Jane was the model and that was important because just like Peter it was a mistake to take her at face value.  Instead Dunst gets to sing a couple of songs and while the movie agrees she is not good enough to sing on Broadway it seems a strange way to create a crack in her self-confidence, especially given that nobody faked self-confidence better than MJ.  But they are fully committed to the idea of Mary Jane as the girl next door even if they have yet to figure out what that means for the character and her relationship with Peter.  Howard is not given much to do, although her last moment is her character's best, and the same goes for James Cromwell as Captain Stacy.  But Bruce Campbell completely steals his one scene, Mageina Tovah as Ursula steals a couple, and Stan Lee has his best \\"Spider-Man\\" cameo to date, but Dylan Baker's Dr. Curt Connors is still no closer to turning into the Lizard.<br /><br />The main element they have kept from \\"Spider-Man 2\\" is the idea that the conflict between Spider-Man and his foes is no longer black and white, but shades of gray.  I liked that for once Doctor Octopus was not a ranting lunatic with mechanical arms but a good man turned evil by a fateful accident (the flip of what happened to Peter Parker) who refuses to die a monster.  It was that moment more than Mary Jane discovering that Peter was Spider-Man that really gave \\"SM2\\" its weight.  This time around there are important shadings for Flint Marko and Harry Osborn, just as there are for Peter Parker as his black Spider-Man costume gets the better of him (but Eddie Brock, Jr. is bad to the bone from start to finish).<br /><br />In the end I round down on \\"Spider-Man 3\\" because I think they are overdoing it with Spider-Man's mask coming off or being half torn (even though I understand the impulse to have the face of the actor you are paying millions to actually appear on screen), the comic relief from spectators during the big battle at the end gets in the way of the developing tragedy, and the fade out scene was by far the weakest of the series to date.  I am also not happy with the way Peter's character is regressing, because even before the symbiotic flips him to the dark side he is embracing his inner nerd way too much.  Maguire is hysterical when he has Peter strut himself down the street, but it rings wrong for the character.  Also, even with the swelled head he is getting from the public adoration as Spider-Man, I do not want to believe that having the costume on when he receives the key to the city was enough to let Peter betray MJ the way he does there.  The scene later on at the Jazz club is the insult; it was the other that was the real injury part of the equation.  Still, I bet I make it back to the theater to see this one again.did not have the significance or resonance of the original storyline.

0439813786|5.0|Well, I was getting ready to send this out to my nephew who is 14 but started reading it.  Needless to say it got to him late.  I loved this book and I'm a grandmother!  THe drawings were fabulous, and the whole thing reminded me of a really good black and white movie, the kind that had better not turn into color!  Selnick's story moves along well and I found myself rushing through to see the next drawing to go with my own picture in my mind of what was happening. AFter I was finished, I studied the back of the book and started writing down all those old movies and went to my local library.  The next few weeks I had all these silent movies to watch including A Trip to the Moon, several Charlie Chaplin movies, other stuff from George Melies and found myself even researching automatons,- it was great!  I just hope the nephew that finally got the book for his birthday finds not only the book fascinating but all the periferal stuff as well.  What a great writer!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth is quite simply the most jaw dropping natural history series I have ever seen. Now I do not fancy myself a lover of nature documentaries but I have seen one or two in my time and this one takes the cake. This isn't simply educational. It's cinematic. The one thing that seperates this from others is that you become entranced and emotionally involved in the happenings before you.     Shot in High Defination (with the exception of a small percentage of scenes) the image quality is breathtaking. Never before have I seen anything look this good on my TV. I'm using a 30\\" High Def with 720p and it still looks crystal clear. I can only imagine what it would look like on a bigger TV in 1080p.     Sound wise it does the job well but it isn't an immersive cinematic experience. But for a program like this you really shouldn't expect that. The narration is up front and the rears are used when needed. One minor quibble is that sometimes the score seems to almost drown out the narration.     no extras on the HD DVD but the image quality makes up for it.    All in all Planet Earth is a must have if you are equipped with HD-DVD. It's subject matter and stunning image will leave you speechless.
B00005JPFH|5.0|The newest installment of the Spiderman franchise promised a lot, and actually kept a lot, but not all. <br /> <br />The production values of \\"Spiderman 3\\" are, as we've come to expect, fantastic. The visual effects are stunning, the fights interesting and exilarating, the sound amazing, very well casted and well acted. It just goes on where the first and the second movie let off. <br /> <br />\\"Spiderman 3\\" is by far the funniest of the three movies, and at the same time also by far the darkest. The comedy ranges from J Jonah Jamesons rantings and Bruce Campbells cameo part as in the previous two movies to a physical and circumstantial comedy when Peter Parker finds his \\"badass\\" self which is unlike anything in the first two films. The dark side of the film is, as the tagline tells us, Parkers struggle within. We see him go from confident (where he's just a bit infatuated with himself) to bordering cocky (where his loveaffair with himself gets more heated) and finally to an arrogant bastard (where he's deeply in love with himself). The story of Harry/the Green Goblin also develops even further with Harrys deepening madness and love/hate relationship with Peter Parker, which makes a very interesting storyline. Also of course we see the rise of venom, one of the darkest and most twisted characters in the Marvel universe. <br /> <br />It's not all a dance on roses though. First of all, with all those bad guys in play, they each don't get the attetion they deserve. There's not enough character development, and not enough \\"action time\\" for the baddies. They do it as well as can be done with the amount of time available. I don't think there's much that could have been improved in the film in this respect except for cutting out one of the characters (which in my opinion is what should've been done). They cleverly avoid the trap of \\"X Men 3\\", where it's all just a big confused mess though. We do get to know the characters, just not well enough. <br />The character of Sandman, well played as it is, is a bit reminiscent of Doctor Octopus in the second film. It's hard to be convinced that he's truly a bad fellow. The biggest problem, characterwise though, is Venom. He gets very short time to develop and therefore seem as just another henchman or such, not really a main bad character. I think the best way to give him room to develop and still make him a main bad guy, was to have the creation of him in this film and then use him in a possible fourth. Also his voice is all wrong. <br />Apart from the character/time problems, there's also a problem with one of the scenes. As Peter Parker grows more and more arrogant we see him develop in a very funny way. The way he walks, talks and acts all change in a hillarious way. The culmination of this change, a dance number in a nightclub, is sadly not up to par. It was, as another reviewer remarked, truly worthy of \\"the Mask\\", but not Spiderman. <br /> <br />I still give this film 5 stars because it is pure entertainment and there are some very good comedy in there. The images alone are enough of a reason to see \\"Spiderman 3\\", but there is so much more to be had from it. <br />  <br />I'm a long time fan of the comic so I guess, I may be a bit biased in my views, but still I would say that this film is highly recommendable. Go get it!
B0000021RB|5.0|Not that that is a \\"bad\\" thing--because to my ears, it's not. But the point I'm making is to show you how much the focus of this band's music had shifted from the first album to future albums. And if I didn't know any better, I would have thought that this album was a vehicle for guitarist Terry Kath's solo career. If you listen to this album throughout, you can make the conclusion that this was Terry Kath's album, as he was pretty much given free room to roam on virtually every track unrestrained--including his own pyrotechnic \\"freak-out\\" number, \\"Free Form Guitar\\". This is a far cry from even the next two albums, when the horns, which were supposed to be Chicago's trademark in the beginning, seem to at least share as much or more of the soloing. Much later, it would become ALL horns!  <br />But it looks like in the beginning, Chicago was largely a \\"guitar-based\\" band, centering around Terry Kath, who also shared a lot of the singing in the early days. It didn't seem to be Peter Cetera's band, as it seemed to come to be known many years later. The singing was shared a lot between Terry Kath, and organist Robert Lamm--who in my opinion, has one of the classiest singing voices in rock, especially on one of Chicago's most beautiful ballads--\\"Beginnings\\". As Chicago and Santana both played many of the same rock festivals during this period, it was easy to see a lot of similarities between Lamm and Gregg Rolie from Santana, as both men, similar in appearance, seemed to be the singing organists who stoked the engines of their repsective large bands--but Lamm was much less the organist than Rolie was for Santana. Perhaps, however, he was a better songwriter. <br />But again, I see this as largely a guitar player's album. Every aspiring guitar player should give this one a listen. Pay close attention to Terry Kath's techniques, feel, tone, distortion, and choice of amplification, because it is \\"smokin'\\" hot, and some of the best of 1969. In fact, I would register this among the best guitar albums of 1969--I know that sounds strange for a group known mostly for horns, but Terry Kath's contributions to rock guitar can simply not go ignored!
038560310X|5.0|What a ride.  In my copy Bret Eston Ellis has reviewed it and asked Will I ever recover?  I've had a week of no sleep, reading at stop lights and general dysphoria.  I am now exhausted but atleast finished.  This book is more than a story; it's a disease, an experience, a phenomenon.  You'll read it upside down, back-to-front, three pages at once, some pages not at all.   <br />I found it lost momentum for a moment near the end, but by then I needed the break.  This novel will play you like no book has.    <br />In House of Leaves, one of the characters burns his own fingers so he has light to read by.  I would have too.  5 stars.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This film has deserved the prestigious nomination and notable distinction - at least to my view - to occupy a relevant place in the recent production of the cinema.<br /><br />The result has been amazing. Not only this gem movie captivates and engages the most exigent viewer from start to finish. At the end of the projection you experience that cathartic magic of the cinema, because it's the cinema paying a priceless tribute to itself. It is the eternal ritornello that many times before we have heard it: the cinema is a dream's fabric An universe of illusions, where the spectral shadows and these twenty four shots by second personify and represent a dramatis personae.<br /><br />An illusionist Eissenheim, attracts the whole attention in the Vienna of the late years of the XIX Century. He met in his early adolescence the love of his life, his personal muse. He will focus himself around the illusionism as a way to make his life and astonish the world through his undeniable gifts.<br /><br />The careful photography in sepia, the marvelous shot angles, the effective camera work and the presence of a magnificent and inspired cast supported by a bewitching script, literally seduce us and invites to participate with this talented and novel director Neil Burger of one of the most original and surprising works around this interesting issue. I must confess that since Istvan Szabo's Hanussen, I had not enjoyed of such lavish achievement.<br /><br />Special kudos for Paul Giamatti (who is demonstrating step by step without making too much noise, to be one of the most talented mature actors at this moment) and Edward Norton who makes a convincing role. The employment of the iris in the epilogue of the film  and the special and that little but smart detail of the hat and that sardonic laugh is an extraordinary device that crowns a film made with good taste, fertile imagination and profound love for the cinema.
B000E8QVWY|2.0|I learned some valuable lessons from this movie, and consider myself much instructed thereby.<br /><br />One thing I learned from watching this is that adultery is cool.  Marriage is just another obstacle to get around.  See, if you've got a dream, and your spouse stands in the way (for example by suggesting that you pay some attention to her and help provide for your progeny), it's totally okay to dump her and latch on to someone more exciting, someone who believes in you.  Everything will be considered your wife's fault for having opposed your dream in the first place.<br /><br />(Johnny and Vivian's daughter, Rosanne Cash, was reportedly furious over this movie, claiming that her mother actually encouraged her father's music playing, the complete opposite of what is portrayed in the film.)<br /><br />Is it just me?  Has adultery and dishonoring one's marriage vows gone so completely out of fashion that filmmakers will portray a man callously ditching his wife and family, and yet not even seem aware of what they're showing?  The whole emphasis in this film was on how Johnny's spirit \\"needed to be free\\" so he could make his wonderful music.  Not a whiff of (or even a consciousness of) the moral problems presented by such behavior.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just getting older, but I'm getting sick of this crud.  And I've been noticing more and more of it.  Next time I see a movie doing this, I'm just gonna shut it clean off.  Those who toss their wives to chase their muses have nothing to say to me.

0140186409|5.0|What you're looking at is one of those slightly oversized paperbacks.  It's quite handsomely done, and the print is largish and easy to read.<br /><br />On the down side, the text merely consists of the text itself:  there are no footnotes or a glossary to help you with extinct terms and stuff, but there is a longish prefatory essay by Robert DeMott (with suggestions for further reading) that is quite an able piece of writing.

B000002J0G|4.0|Testament is one of my favorite bands. Having consistently released quality work throughout their career. And low is no exception never straying to far from their bay area thrash sound but being far from generic sounding. Low is the first cd to feature chuck billy using death metal vocals found on the song dog faced gods. Which would dominate their future demonic release. The high points of the cd are what has made testament so highly respected in metal circles since the 80's. Great guitar work,solos,lyrics,vocals, and drumming. Hail mary is one of my favorite songs possesing great guitar work,vocals and a killer chorus. Trail of tears is one of my favorite songs a slower number great guitar and vocals keep interest throughout. P.C.,chsing fear,low,legions in hiding are other highlights keeping the thrash quotient high. The only low points would be the song ride as it has a mediocre riff and goes nowhere. And the instrumentals just take up space. Overall low is another great release by a band sticking proudly to their bay area thrash roots.
1400032717|5.0|This book is going right up on my shelf next to Christopher Moore, Nick Hornby, Running With Scissors, Everything Is Illuminated, Widow of the South, The Shipping News, all the great contemporary fiction that mixes Romantic and Modernist style into thoroughly enjoyable reads (i.e. understandable, yet utterly powerful, moving, and still poetic). This novel is very Sound and the Fury, but much, much more accessible. Christopher (who is writing the novel for school) is (probably) Autistic. He is a very, very concrete thinker (math, science, logic are very accessible to him, but he is easily upset by anything emotional, imaginative, or slightly analytical), and so Christopher's prose is mathematical and matter-of-fact, containing a beautifully unique poetry. For instance, he describes the stars and how far away they are, and how problems seem so small comparatively. He explains that there is no heaven, but his mother is ashes floating in the sky above him. And yet, Christopher reacts with bursts of emotion (\\"groaning\\" and \\"screaming\\") over problems like colors, which goes against his logical nature. He has no concept of human emotions or other people's desires. While he depends on his parents, he's rather live in a world without any people. It's so true to the spirit and minds of kids with disabilities, that the book can be forgiven any leaps of reality. It reaches such a deeper truth. The novel captures exactly how Christopher thinks and feels, even though he doesn't understand his own emotions. We understand why he becomes scared, why he doesn't want to be touched, why he becomes so overwhelmed by the world. Even if Christopher can't understand us, we certainly can identify with him. Even though we can't understand Christopher's behavior, perhaps--like his parents--become frustrated with him, we fall in love with him, care deeply for him, root for him on his hero journey to his mother. Christopher discovers his neighbor's dog murdered and uses his logical and mathematical deductions to solve the mystery. This leads to a journey of discovery of his family and the world at large, and brings about deep changes in Christopher's world. At the heart of the novel is Christopher, a complicated, talented, and amazing individual character, who is the center of his troubled family (which are too concerned with emotions). It's a beautiful, powerful, and wonderful story told in an amazing way. No one would regret reading this book. Grade: A+
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|With PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS, Robert Plant continues to move forward musically and lyrically. On this CD, Plant continues on the path to where Led Zeppelin might have gone had drummer John Bonham not died in an alcohol-related choking incident in 1980.
0786838655|5.0|In traditional hero-fashion, a unique young boy discovers that he is part god (Poseidon is his father, to be exact) and is sent on a quest to clear his name of the thievery of Zeus' lightning bolt. If he doesn't succeed, Western Civilization will be thrust into WWIII. He is accompanied by his best friend, a satyr, and Athena's daughter, Annabeth. Along the way, of course, he must deal with numerous mythical demons (the Gorgon, the Furies, Ares, a Minotaur, Procrustes). The book is predictable (especially if you know something of Greek mythology and hero tales and Joseph Campbell). It lacks twists, turns, and a mystery to confound an adult reader. The characters are pretty flat (archetypes without pizzazz). Worst of all, there's a haunting Harry Potter-ness to it (which is not a good thing, as imitations are but shadows). Those three things aside, this is a pretty darn good book. Especially if you are a Greek myth geek. Frankly, it is a modern retelling of the myth (and this would work a bit better if it didn't try so hard to connect to the original myths). It's actually quite a brilliant and clever modernization. Procrustes is a sleazy furniture salesman, Ares rides a motorcycle, the Furies are spinster Algebra teachers. Our hero doesn't only have to deal with the fate of being half-god and a hero, but he also has to deal with his abandoning father and his cruel stepfather. This, I'm sure, is something that many, many kids today can identify with. Yes, mythology is still hugely pertinent today, and Riordan has created a superb updating. He's made a delicious and appropriate mix of the allegorical and the imaginative, showing why these tales have endured. He turns the metaphorical creatures and objects into more familiar and modern ones, without losing any of the beautiful antiquity or the deeper meaning. The writing is also incredible. It is honest-to-gods funny, particularly the chapter headings. Also, the descriptions of characters, moods, places, and thing of modernized Greek mythology is poetic and powerful. This is a great book if you're a Greek myth nerd (just for play and recognition and getting the joke), but it's also a great book if you're a kid and just getting to know the Greek myths. Grade: A-
B000HWZ5X8|5.0|With MANIC NIRVANA, Robert Plant goes beyond reaching back to his Led Zeppelin roots and covers old R&B songs such as \\"Your Ma Says You Cried In Your Sleep Last Night.\\" In other words, Plant digs REALLY deep here, while continuing to move forward by returning to aggressive hard rock following two highly psychodramatic albums. Overall, MANIC NIRVANA continues to where Led Zeppelin might have gone had drummer John Bonham not died in an alcohol-related choking incident in 1980.
B000A5044C|5.0|Nobody Knows is a very moving and powerful movie. In Nobody Knows, four children, each with a different father, are abandoned by their mother with only $500 and their apartment. They try to live without further assistance while waiting for their mother to return. What is even more tragic about this movie is that the real life story that it is based on (The affair of the four abandoned children of Sugamo) was much more horrible. <br /> <br />It is very much like another very sad movie that I have watched, Grave of the Fireflies. They are both about children living in dire poverty without the aid of adults, both Japanese, both sad, and both based upon true stories, and neither has a happy ending. Even though this movie is painful to watch, I still reccomend it, as it is very well made and has a powerful (and I think important) message. People need each other's help to survive, and children are especially vulnerable. Be your brother's keeper; extend a helping hand to those in need.
B000HWZ5VU|5.0|On PICTURES AT ELEVEN, Robert Plant's first solo album, he picks up where his former band's last one, IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR, left off, showing that when drummer John Bonham died in an alcohol-related choking incident in 1980, a lot of work remained unfinished. This album successfully takes the classic Zeppelin sound and style to the next level, and what you get here is where Zeppelin might have gone had Bonham lived. As a result, this CD provides comfort to Zeppelin fans brooding over the demise of their favorite band.
079284131X|4.0|This is the movie that spawned 4 sequels (all inferior) and gave rise to one of the most well known and feared characters in horror cinema: \\"Chucky the killer doll.\\" <br /> <br />To save himself from death, a man puts his soul into a doll because \\"nobody would be able to hurt\\" him but, more than that, he had no other choice.  The doll is then bought by a mother as a birthday gift to her 6 year old son.  Over the next couple of days the reincarnated Chucky is determined to settle old scores with the people who killed him.  Spooky enough for you? <br /> <br />Alright, the doll isn't THAT scary-looking.  But I just love its attitude of killing without mercy and the fact that the doll obviously enjoys killing people.  I wasn't scared so much as thrilled that the doll loves doing what it does and makes an art of it and, I think deliberately, tries to be creative in how it kills people.  This doll also has what has got to be THE most distinctive and recognizable laugh of any major horror figure. <br /> <br />It's all good fun except for one thing:  The reason why I didn't give five stars is the kid (Andy) sucks at acting.  I know he's just a kid but there are millions of kids out there and thousands of them could do a better job.  How this kid said his lines didn't 'feel' right half the time. <br /> <br />One last thing: Chucky is not, in my opinion, the scariest doll in horror films.  If you want to get something that involves a truly scary doll and makes Chucky look nice you should see the Trilogy of Terror.  Having said that, I think that Chucky is, if not the scariest, arguably the most entertaining.  It's a great movie to watch on a Friday night with a couple of friends.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend that you at least rent it.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|Ridley Scott? Russel Crowe? Again Hollywood has done it. Taken talent and managed to make a so-so movie. Ok, it is really cute. An English banker somehow inherits an estate in the South of France (!) where of course an excpetoinal wine happens to be produced secretly (Coin Perdu). Of course he meets a French woman and so on...I mean this is completely incredible in some ways that they dared to write such a screenplay. A bunch of bad clich&eacute;s thrown together...Ok it is nice and we had a good time watching it but actually it is very slow-moving and there is really no story. Oh by the way the real star of the movie is the Palm Treo phone that gets displyaed quite often (it also does not work that well in reality).
B00005JPFH|5.0|This movie is a \\"must see\\" for all superhero fans, action movie fans, and especially Spider-Man fans.  There were many negative reviews floating around about this movie, but also many reviews claiming it was excellent as well.  The range of different opinions was really surprising.   <br /> <br />Modern special effects really do Spider-Man justice, and it is clear that a lot of thought went into this movie, as well as a lot of hard work with the computer animation effects.  They are very high quality and truly seem real.  There was so much going on, really a lot to sink your teeth into.  It's complicated but still manages to be understandable throughout.  It's around 2 1/2 hours long, but time flies because you are having fun.  Some complained that there was not enough time with Venom, which is a valid point, but I'm sure that the movie in it's entirety will make up for that.  All I can say is if you fit into one of the said categories, give this movie a chance.  You will not regret it.
B00005JPFF|5.0|I went to see \\"Spider-Man 3\\" tonight after reading several not-so-great reviews earlier today from local newspapers. So I had some doubts going into the theater. Well I'm sure glad I went anyway, because this movie was a BLAST. The critics need to lighten up. No, it wasn't a perfect film, and if one insists on being a hardass they can nit-pick it and find some valid faults. But overall, it was one of the most exciting and *fun* movies I've seen in quite some time. <br /> <br />One of the complaints seems to be that too many villains are in it. I thought this may be the case before seeing it, but I thought the film handled their screen time quite well, even if Venom didn't get to do much (although he does have a very good showdown with Spider-Man during the final confrontation scene). But I gotta say that the Sandman grabbed my attention the most, especially his fight scenes with Spider-Man and others. To me, seeing the Sandman in the final confrontation was worth the price of admission. The special effects for his character were simply outstanding - they were fairly standard CGI for the others. <br /> <br />As with the other 2 movies, the scenes of humor were well timed and executed, without compromising the tone of the film. I do wish that Kirsten Dunst hadn't gotten suspended high in the air yet again, because we all know that Spider-Man is going to save her from falling, yet again. But I suppose that's a minor irritation I can live with. Performance-wise, I liked everyone in their roles. We already knew what to expect from Maguire and Dunst, so there were no surprises there. Thomas Haden Church put in a good show as the Sandman. And although I wish they had let Bryce Dallas Howard be her lovely redheaded self, she still looked mighty fine, and I'm glad she got a considerable amount of screen time. <br /> <br />IMO the first \\"Spider-Man\\" film was decent but not much more than that. And I'd rate the second film along with this third installment as superb, just in different ways. Part 2 was great due to the solid story and overall script. While part 3 lacks some of that, it more than makes up for it with better and bolder action and pure entertainment level. I was originally going to give this 4 stars but decided to go all the way to 5 mainly because I had such a great time with it. Think of this film as the nitro-charged extension of part 2 and I'll bet you'll find yourself more than pumped by the time the end credits roll.

I am so genuinely happy listening to some of the songs on this album (try \\"Rhayader\\" and \\"Rhayader Goes to Town\\" first). Even the \\"darker songs\\" without the flute melody make me smile, they are just that amazing.

B000OHZJLY|5.0|When \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" first hit the shelves, critics were falling over themselves with superlatives. Even Columbia's \\"Artist...Masterpiece?\\" ad campaign was begging the question. Was this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around Elvis Costello's neck since \\"My Aim Is True?\\"<br /><br />The answer was yes...and no.<br /><br />Granted, hiring Geoff Emerick to put his Beatle-esque touches made for a handsome, rich sound, more than any other album in EC's discography. The expansiveness paid off right from the album's opener, \\"Beyond Belief.\\" Toying with his own range and the overlapping vocal parts, Elvis' willingness to experiment rocked the foundations of all the early \\"punks\\" of the period. (Think of how closely Joe Jackson's \\"Night And Day\\" and The Police's \\"Synchronicity\\" followed.) The experiments were also inherent to the arrangements. The high pitched strings that slip out of the album's fade to \\"Town Cryer\\" were four cellos overdubbed to sound like an entire string section, as I recall.<br /><br />Working from the pretext that they could experiment like the Beatles did, each song was tinkered and toyed with till (as you can hear in the comparisons to the bonus disc's demo versions) they barely resembled their original ideas. It made the original album's side one a song suite of near \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" proportions, with the standout of \\"Man Out Of Time\\" marking the perfect bridge between the Elvis of old and the Elvis of new. His anguished howl that breaks the song open and then ushers it into the heartbreak of \\"Almost Blue\\" reset the boundaries of compositions in 1982.<br /><br />Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were also being tossed around when \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" first came out, one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with \\"serious music\\" than to the obvious merits of Elvis' songwriting prowess. The debt to Tin Pan Alley (\\"The Long Honeymoon\\") is truly there. But the lyrical jabs and jibes are still pure Costello, and a line like \\"In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman's shoes\\" would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross. I'd be hard pressed to imagine Cole Porter working up the anger behind \\"Shabby Doll.\\"<br /><br />In short, the dark and introspective \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" was a turning point for Elvis, final proof that he was at the crest of the still expanding wave of British writers that had begun emerging in the early 80's.

B000OHZJKK|5.0|If \\"[[ASIN:B00005MLU0 My Aim Is True (With Bonus Disc)]]\\" landed on the music scene like a stick of dynamite with the fuse lit, \\"This Year's Model\\" was the explosion that came after. Elvis' first album with the Attractions more than lived up to its predecessor, in that having a working band behind him matched the music to the blunt force of the songs.<br /><br />Once again, it is the stark voice of EC that opened the album as he ominously intones \\"I don't wannna kiss you, I don't wanna touch.\\" When the players kick in, it's a whole 'nother world from \\"My Aim Is True,\\" and for the first time, \\"new wave\\" had a front man. Before this album had been released, one of the central songs had made headlines. Elvis' broadside at narrow-format broadcasting, \\"Radio Radio,\\" was performed in such a bizarre fashion on Saturday Night Live that he was effectively banned from the show for almost a decade and made this (then) seventeen year-old a fan for life. That performance sealed a decision for me to get into radio and make artists like Elvis accessible to listeners. When I was fortunate enough to tell him this many years later, Elvis kindly autographed a ragged poster of \\"Armed Forces\\" \\"Don't blame me.\\"<br /><br />Personal nostalgia aside, fourth CD version \\"This Year's Model\\" contains all the songs that comprised the original US and UK versions and the original UK artwork. These are some of the songs by which EC is measured, like \\"Radio Radio,\\" \\"Pump it Up\\" and \\"The Beat.\\" The Attractions' playing was melody driven in addition to frenetic, a perfect compliment to Elvis' brilliant lyrics. And it was already becoming apparent that keyboardist Steve Nieve was becoming an architect of what American ears would identify as \\"punk rock.\\" The remainder of \\"This Year's Model\\" provides some hot songs that proved what this band of raving 20 somethings were capable in their rock and roll youth. This was the second of Elvis' \\"Angry Young Man\\" trilogy and it is a perfect moment.

B000O178BY|5.0|Through the past decade very little in the way of great influential music has arisen. A few good bands and musicians have risen, true. But only a few. And even those who were once great have weakened musically.  <br /> <br />The Fragile was compelling and listenable, but it didn't measure up to The Downward Spiral or Broken. With Teeth, although it grew on me a little, still doesn't match up to even the Fragile. <br /> <br />Then we come to Year Zero. The first few listens of some of the early released tracks, especially In This Twilight, wetted my appetite. Listening now to the full album, I can hear a turning point in the future of Nine Inch Nails. If some other artists start picking up on this vibe, maybe music itself will really pick up again. This album haunts, lifts the listeners on it's bleak waves and drops us on the edge of our future to watch the nation collapse. <br /> <br />Yes, this album is politically subversive. Not because it's criticizing George W Bush, but because it's NOT about GW. It's bigger than one man could ever hope to be. It's about the direction the changing trends we see now could easily take us... the Jesus camps, anti-abortion measures, growing levels of fanatic patriotism, religious politics, advances in genetics and chemistry and weaponry, the condensing of the broad spectrum of possibilities into narrow sighted, either-or, left-right politics and the marginalising of all other choices, subsuming the human being in the Great Machine, marginalizing free speech, press that's all-too-close to and dependent on the government, increased technological complexity, the constant barrage of fear-generating news, and especially, of reducing people to mere numbers. As Zero-sum says, \\"Shame on us, for all we've ever done, and all we ever were, just zeroes and ones.\\"

Nowadays they just don't make 'em like that anymore. Sad but true. (I'm not keen on the Pixar flicks, sorry). I vividly remember going to see each and one of them (starting with \\"Mermaid\\" in the spring of 1990) on the big screen. Those were scarce moments of true childhood innocence. Times that you take with you forever, and Disney has done just that to almost every kid in the world during the last 70 years. \\"Aladdin\\" came out at the peak of Disney's third golden age that started in 1989. The company released a number of films which broke new ground in animation and were huge artistic and commercial successes as well. Although it broke a few records when it came out on video in 1993, for some odd reason, this DVD release sold a meager amount of copies, catching everyone at the studio by surprise. Nevertheless, \\"Aladdin\\" remains as enjoyable as ever and much better than most of its successors.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I was *literally* dragged into the theater to see this movie a few months ago by a friend, an intellectual type who's dedicated his life to learning all there is to know about 20th Century American/English history. A movie about the stoic and staid (and boring?) Queen of England? Only a glass of warm milk could send me to my slumbers more quickly. I nestled down into the comfy seat with my milkduds and diet coke and prepared to take a nap as soon as the lights went dim, but I was delightfully surprised.<br /><br />The acting was first rate and both Michael Sheen and Helen Mirren were exemplary in every way. The most touching moment of the movie was the scene where the queen goes off to grieve privately, in the solitude of the countryside. That scene (and the rest of the movie) is both poignant, memorable and beautifully acted.<br /><br />The real footage of Princess Di was nicely woven into the film, as was the story line. And despite having seen (and read) voluminous amounts of news about her untimely death, this movie showed her passing from a wholly different angle and gave me a new perspective on the whole sad affair.<br /><br />One of the interesting benefits of this flick is it shows with great clarity the relationships (and interrelationships) between the Prime Minister, Parliament, the Queen and her staff.<br /><br />Loved it, loved it, loved it!

Not that we didn't know what the dysfunctional royal's thought of the \\"People's Princess\\" beforehand.<br /><br />Whatever your views on the British monarchy are, you have to admit that it's all about image and perception.  An exspensive image that the British taxpayers seem to be stuck with like the debt we bare here.  Prince Philip and Prince Charles come off as clowns in the movie, but thats no surprise.  Tony Blair as the new \\"modernist\\" PM, well he's about to leave office so the least said on his l-o-n-g term the better.  As for the Queen, well this movie serves her quite well.  Certainly it boosts her PR and celebrity rating.  And you find yourself asking, what happens when she steps down.  Who are we stuck with then?<br /><br />Stephen Frears on a very limited budget, has delivered a first class depiction of the royal's world and how they function under crisis.  Like the theatrical performer who has to go on despite their personal feelings, the Queen is contracted by pageantry and tradition to carry on the show!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List may well be Steven Spielberg's crowning masterpiece.  This is quite an achievement considering his other great films like E.T. and Saving Private Ryan.  Schindler's List is one of the most compelling films that I've ever seen.  You find yourself horrified and moved at the same time.  Anyone who truly believes that one person can't make a difference should add this film to their list.<br /><br />The story concerns how Oskar Schindler, a philandering, womanizing businessman finds himself with an opportunity to literally save the lives of over a thousand Jews.  This is not what he initially sets out to do.  His intial desire is to make money.  He has the charisma and money to sway and bribe high military officials to do what he wants.  There is a scene where a Jewish woman comes to him to ask that he take her parents into his factory because she knows it's safe.  Schindler becomes angry concerning this.  However, as much as Schindler would like to distance himself from his Jewish workers as well as the tragic events surrounding the holocaust, he can't.  The initial reason for him using Jewish workers is because they are the cheapest.<br /><br />The first scene that starts to make an indelible impression is during the elimination of the Jewish population in Krakow.  Schindler sits on a horse overlooking the small town and watches in horror as Jewish people are slaughtered.  Spielberg uses a brilliant touch here as we follow a small, blond girl in red as she runs and weaves herself through this mass murder.  Schindler is unable to take his eyes off of her.<br /><br />The power behind this story really begins when Schindler decides to use his mass fortune to literally buy the lives of his workers.  And the one scene that still touches me so powerfully each and every time I watch this movie, is at the end when Schindler is sobbing uncontrollably for not saving even more lives because he wasted so much of his money.<br /><br />This is Liam Neeson's best performance, in my opinion.  And as good as Tom Hanks was in Philadelphia, I really believe that Liam should have taken the Oscar for this film.  He gives Oskar Schindler such humanistic qualities that changes throughout the film.  At first, he's simply a powerful businessman whose sole desire is to make money.  He loves women, find foods, and clothes.  Finally, his attachments and deeper feelings develop toward his workers.  Evidence of this blossoms to a point where he reminds one of his workers that it's Friday, the Sabbath, as he gives his worker a bottle of wine so that he and others may commemorate the Jewish day.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley is wonderful as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's personal secretary and accountant.  Kingsley plays Stern as a vey skeptical man who really isn't sure of Schindler's motives.  This is especially true when Schindler talks the Jewish businessmen into giving him all of their cash so that he can get is factory running.  Stern's views of Schindler slowly soften as he realizes that there is something deeper in Schindler than he ever realized.  And, of course, this comes forth when Schindler confesses to Stern that he is, in fact, using his money to buy his Jewish workers.  And while Schindler never says so outright, we know that he is NOT buying them to be his workers as much as he's trying to save their lives.  In the end, Stern knows and understands this.<br /><br />One can't talk about the performances of Schindler's List without mentioning Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic Amon Goeth.  Here is a German commander who sees the Jewish people as nothing more than animals.  He shoots them arbitrarily from the top of his villa which overlooks the Jewish camp.  The slightest offense is met with execution.  There is a brief time when Schindler explains to Goeth what true power is.  \\"Real power is when we have every reason to kill, but we don't.  This is why a king pardons a person who's done something wrong.\\"  At first Goeth practices this, but ultimately, he takes too much pleasure in killing the Jewish people.  He could easily top the list as one of the most disliked characters in film history.<br /><br />I think an aspect of this film that really makes it powerful is the cinematic score of John Williams.  The use of the violin, especially from world renowned violinist, Itzhak Perlman, is so effective in how it conveys the tragedy of the holocaust.  The tune is simple, but it finds a way to burn itself into your mind until you hear the tune well after the film has ended.<br /><br />Schindler's List can be a difficult film to watch, but in so many ways, it is important to the history of humanity to understand what transpired among the Jewish population, with the hopes and assurances that nothing like this will ever happen again.<br /><br />Most people don't realize that most \\"heroes\\" are not perfect beings.  And Oskar Schindler, in this film, is certainly not depicted as being what you might think of a saint to be.  He's simply a man who does something amazing.  Each and every person out there is capable of doing the same thing.  There are many such examples throughout history, both in the past and today.

0812975219|1.0|I read through probably 25% of the book and couldn't understand the point of the book. The book itself seems random. This book is positively rated here so  it is probably for people who can manage to survive the randomness of the book itself.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|It took me about 4 or 5 listens before I went from hating it to really enjoying it. This record will be off putting to a lot of Rush fanatics because the infusion of folk and blues into this one is probably not what they want to hear. <br /> <br />I don't think I have anything to say that hasn't aready been said on this forum but I will say give the darn record a chance! Rush fans can be the whiniest people sometimes, listen to it 4 or 5 times with an open mind before posting here! <br /> <br />Spindrift, Good News First, and Faithless are my favorites. <br /> <br />Lastly, I would have given it 5 stars, but I gave it 4 stars because some of Peart's lyrics seem preachy and activist-like. Also, I wish Geddy didn't have to layer his vocals so much! I gets frustrating to listen to sometimes, he layers his vocals 90% of the time, and they do nothing but detract from the songs. \\"Arrows and Swords\\" is a prime example. <br /> <br />That said, this is a good record, still. On par with Vapor Trails, but with a superior sound quality <br />
B000NVIXFK|5.0|As I serve in Iraq and just being notify that my tour here would be extended it was hard to get motivated until I received Snakes and Arrows  from [...]. Believe me there are days here that \\"I feel that I am ahead of the wheel and the next it is rolling all over me.\\" I will get back home.    Rush has done it again. The incredible evolution of this talented Trio has amazed me and motivated me. Like most of you it took multiple listening sessions to discern the true talent and skill. I like the fact that as I progress in my life so do the talents of Rush.     I have been a Rush fan since my freshman year in High School and I have not missed a tour yet.  However, 20 years later, I will miss this tour as a result of my commitment to our great and beautiful nation.     Enjoy the tour and have a drink for the Boys in Iraq. To the artists of Rush...Thanks.       The point of Departure is not to return......Anything can happen
B00005JPD0|3.0|This movie was great until the last 5 minutes, then it get totally confusing . Seriously, you shouldn't have to look up the ending on the internet to figure out what happened.  Stupid writers.
B000I9VZJ8|4.0|When someone gushes about a movie being the funniest thing they've ever seen, it usually kills it for me.  Fortunately, I had no expectations at all for this movie, and ended up thinking it was hilarious.<br /><br />I don't know where to start...Napoleon's brother is SUCH a dweeb you'll want to smack him yourself---yet I'm laughing even now thinking about him.  There are all these subtle continuity errors and era-inappropriate artifacts that are so obvious they had to be intentional, and even those still make me laugh.<br /><br />But the real reason the movie is funny is because most of the characters are so incredibly pathetic they'll remind you, sometimes quite painfully, of real people.  Some parts almost make you cringe that way.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little different, and if you can sit down to watch this without any particular expectations, you might accidentally get a huge kick out of it.  I did.  (Make sure you watch the part after the credits; a lot of people miss that.)
B000C65Z1G|5.0|I think it is easy to get the wrong idea about this film. It is about so much, and much of it is uncomfortable to watch in many ways. If you focus on what might be considered the 'biggest' aspect of the story, you might just miss what is really important about it.<br /><br />Part of what makes 'The Constant Gardener' hard to watch is that it is so well done. Shot and edited in a gritty, almost documentary style, I felt like I was watching something that was, in ways, more intimate and more real than I should have been seeing. It's a hard illusion to pull off, but here it is accomplished admirably well. Fine performances by all the actors, and in particular the leads, Ralph Fiennes and the stunning Rachel Weisz in her best role to date, make this a compellingly authentic film, one that is difficult to extract yourself from once you are in it.<br /><br />On the surface, 'The Constant Gardener' is about Western pharmaceutical companies and the lengths they will go to to get their drugs to market before their competitors. This is an unstated evil in our culture, a secret we all know about but do not speak of, and this film makes a bold stab against it. Ralph Fiennes, as Justin Quayle, spends much of the film following his dead wife's trail, uncovering the dirty deals and dangerous (sometimes fatal) practices of one such company and one particular drug, and it just seems the more he digs, the worse it gets. It portrays well how Western companies abuse the vulnerable state of many African nations, where the people there do not get the medications they need and how big drug companies take advantage of this. This alone makes it a hard movie to watch.<br /><br />At its core, however, this is not just a political movie with a point to make. At its heart, 'The Constant Gardener' is a moving story of the love between two people. In following the trail of his wife Tessa after her death, Justin revisits his relationship with her.  We see how they met and how their love grew, and we see the passionate woman Tessa was -- passionate about many things. On his journey, Justin rediscovers his wife and his love for her, and he discovers just how much she loved him as well. He learns, along the way, how he could have loved her better. The ending, while sad in a sense, is also beautiful and very moving. It's the only way it could have ended to complete its story.<br /><br />This is a movie about secrets -- political secrets and the secrets of global economies, but also about the intimate secrets lovers keep, between one another and from one another. Though it may seem like a political story on the surface, it is really the story of a passionate love between two people, one which doesn't end even in death. Though it may be uncomfortably intimate at times, in the end it is a beautiful, heartbreaking film, and worth watching more than once., and we see the passionate woman Tessa was -- passionate about many things.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|The world can still use a crooner - and Buble is it!  There is not a bad track on this album. He has sensitivity and sassiness and a voice that I would kill for (not to mention his brooding good looks!) He breathes new life into old standards and really gives them a new interpretation. His popularity proves that there is still an audience for  music with a discernible beat and understandable lyrics. I am now a HUGE Buble fan. Gawd, I wish I could sing like that!

It is a drama focused on the world of intelligence and counterintelligence.<br /><br />I found the movie entertaining and quite compelling.  For someone with an interest in this area, this movie is tremendous.  Hopefully DeNiro continues the story with a sequel.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|OK - I'm partial to Buble. But the boy has a voice and the talent to reallly deliver a song. He has the big band sensibility with some current sassiness that really hits home.  The arrangements are brilliant. He should be around for many years to come - as long as there are people who are ga ga for the standards.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|So wonderful! The captured images are like nothing ever seen before. Truly a good investment. You'll want to watch this over and over again.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Seriously, listen up everyone. Rush has returned to an earlier form on this album and have brought back the heavy guitar, drums and bass in all their glory.  No it is not a return to the denim jacket era of 2112, but to the more passsionate, heavy, synthesized and addictive sounds of the  80's, which I personally loved (Power Windows should be performed in its entirety).  Their musicianship is on full display and the riffs and beats are monumental.  Vapor Trails lacked this (I thought it was a G. Lee solo album) so this album makes up for it.  It is not Moving Pictures II that everyone was looking for, instead it is an awesome progression from MP that secures their status in the top echelon of rock artists.  I predict they are going to blow the doors off the hinges on this tour.
1582701709|3.0|Oprah raves about this book. Courtney Love, the troubled widow of Nirvana's Kirk Cobain, claims that \\"The Secret\\" absolutely changed her life. According to the book's back cover, the secret \\"has been passed down through the ages, highly coveted, hidden, lost, stolen and bought for vast sums of money.\\"  <br /> <br />Wow. Sounds like the Lost Arc. Actually, it's just a terrific marketing ploy. There are many names for this type of nonfiction: \\"New Age\\", \\"Spiritual\\", \\"Holistic\\" to name a few. Readers of this genre hunger for spiritual growth and change. Most are well acquainted with books like \\"A Course in Miracles\\", Eckart Tolle's \\"The Power of Now\\", and the insightful writings of Deepak Chopra and Carolyn Myss. These readers will be somewhat disappointed with \\"The Secret\\" because it's message is no secret at all- thoughts are magnetic, they have a frequency. What you think about most will appear in your life, good or bad.  <br /> <br />That said, for the reader who has not been exposed to any New Age literature or Eastern teachings, \\"The Secret\\" could very well be a life changing book. It contains wonderful nuggets of truth. Ever wonder why some people get trapped in downward spirals of negativity, conflict, debt and disease? According to \\"The Secret\\", their thoughts are creating their circumstances. The reverse is also true. Some people are rich with friendship, family, and material blessings due to their kind and generous thoughts. A man like Donald Trump can go bankrupt and then recreate his vast wealth to an even greater extent, simply by the power of belief. <br /> <br />A big word of warning to anyone who has ever suffered- perhaps lost a loved one to cancer, or experienced a cruel and unexplainable tragedy like the murder of a child. According to \\"The Secret\\", we bring everything to ourselves. No exceptions. The victims of the Holocaust were drawn to the event due to their own negative thinking. The thousands of workers at the World Trade Center on 911 were inthat building on that fateful day because of their thoughts. Does that idea offend you? It should.  <br /> <br />\\"The Secret\\" is an enjoyable summer read, but if taken out of context, it's message is downright dangerous. Let the teaching inspire you to new levels of achievement and happiness in your life, but also approach the message with great caution. It contains grains of truth, but certainly does not encompass all truth as it purports.       <br />
B000NVIXFK|5.0|A superb record.  <br />There is something to be said for first impressions and I'm very impressed with my first listen to this disc. I haven't had that experience with Rush since Counterparts. When Vapor Trails came out it was more of a relief for what it signified about the band's continuation. My reaction to that music was, \\"Oh, it'll grow on me.\\" <br />Snakes and Arrows has taken a cue from Counterparts in regard to dynamics, and while it does harken back to their late 70s output in spirit the playing and execution are right now. They are not riding on the past , but building on it. <br />One thing I like here is that there are three (count 'em, three!) instrumentals. Let's face it, real fans of first class musicians like displays of instrumental virtuosity. Don't you always crank YYZ? (The Allman Bros. ...Elizabeth Reed is an endlessly reinterpreted, consistently interesting good example.) Anyway, on this album, \\"Hope\\" really caused me to prick up my ears. If somebody had just played it for me without any introduction to it, I might have thought I was listening to some long lost Jimmy Page piece! Seems Alex was wearing his influence on his sleeve. And, you know, that's OK (great, even) from a band that is so fiercely original as Rush. <br />Some have complained that a few of the songs don't seem up to snuff. I don't know that I agree, but that is an issue symptomatic of the digital age. CDs can hold 80 minutes of music and artists (or the labels?) feel compelled to fill a good portion of that. The limits of the LP enforced greater selctivity of material. The fact of sides further complicated the matter. The perfection of a record like Permenent Waves has alot to do with that.  <br />Snakes & Arrows is an excellent record for even the causal fan of Rush, assuming such a strange fish even exists.
0553383663|3.0|Mr Vise reports in brief and easy to read chapters the development of Google. Starting from the friendship of its two founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin as Ph D students at Stanford University up to today, when Google is a verb and a successful public company. <br />The book is written in a colloquial tone and works in two directions one the historical evolution of the company and the other deals with very concrete themes related to Google, like the creation of Google News or the Library project. A nice thing is that chapters are self-contained giving the possibility of browsing back and forth as one might like without loosing the thread. <br />The book manages also to describe the main characters and its story in a quite candid way wihtout flattering but keeping as much as possible to the facts. From the other side there are few things that are criticised from Google. Probably the main topic is concerning ad-fraud where the company does not disclose too much information compared to its competitors. (Might be there is no more to criticise). <br />The appendixes are quite interesting, including a series of Google hacks and the aptitude test for the Google Lab which gives an indication of the calliber that Google expects from you in case you want to write some code for them. <br />
B000MNP2KI|4.0|A fantastic movie, certainly one of the best Bond films.  This should have been the first Bond film though!  Judi Dench, great actress, should not have been 'M' in this movie.  The continuity of the Bond series is upset by having the current 'M' as a character.

B000002B2T|5.0|...honestly, this to date, it is in my top 10 albums of all time. <br /> <br />And, I like it all. Electronica, Jazz, Funk, Hard Rock, Trip-Hop, 50's 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and current, etc. Classics as well as new. This album makes you feel. <br /> <br />Sure, since it's release 10+ years ago, it has found itself not on my \\"go-to\\" list more than once. That's the nature of music though. <br /> <br />Yeah, Alice fans will dig, but it's bigger than that. <br /> <br />Where it hits hard...Staley. The man was obviously pained. That in turn produced a moving experience. Although he did the same with Alice, this seems more poignant. <br /> <br />\\"Wake Up\\" is THE most memorable cut. Starts out mellow, Layne crying out, a blues/rock riff, and leads to McCready getting off...just amazing. <br /> <br />The combo of musical influences is evident. Staley, McCready, Lanegan, et al just make beautiful, rocking music. <br /> <br />Not one song disappoints. From beginning to end it messages the soul. Whether a soothing effect or a punch in the the kidney...it's perfect. <br /> <br />Led Zeppilin III is in my top 5 of all time...and this rivals. <br /> <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|This album is amazing. There are brand new tracks on this cd and many of them have a new sound that I've never heard from NIN before. I listened to this cd once the first day I got it and all day at work I had the songs stuck in my head. The deeper the lyrics sunk in, the more meaningful they became to me. This is a NIN fan's \\"must have\\".
B000CBO04E|5.0|During the CD age 'Three Friends' has been the most enigmatic of Gentle Giant's classic releases. Very early on it appeared briefly on the 'Line' label but since the demise of that company the only way of buying this has been to go for Columbia's US version which, as is well known, bears the cover of Giant's debut and self titled album. In a way, History has repeated itself as German re-release specialists, 'Repertoire', have released sonically superior versions of all the first four records - except this one. Their website has listed 'Three Friends'as an 'upcoming release' for several months now but when I saw the Japanese (and authentic) version advertised by an Amazon trader, I decided to pay the requested king's ransom - and I have seldom been happier with a purchase. Not only do we have the magnificent original cover, we are also blessed with far superior sound quality. The theme of the album (that of three schoolfriends who become separated in adult life) seems to acquire ever greater poignancy as the years spin by. Kerry Minnear's 'Schooldays' recalls as though through a dream, the seemingly endless summer of childhood whilst the title (and closing) track would not be out of place performed in a cathedral. At their best, Gentle Giant combined Medieval, Renaissance and Jazz influences with hard rock in a way that made them masters of the progressive genre. What made them extra special was their talent for giving their music an icing of deeply thought provoking lyrics.
0307346609|5.0|Without a doubt WORLD WAR Z is the best novel about zombies ever written.  It's also the subtlest and shrewdest book on politics I've read since Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States.  Nicely dry, appropriately visceral, and absolutely crucial for any fan of the zombie genre.  Filled with intelligence, reverence, and insight.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|If you're one of those \\"fans\\" who wishes Rush never moved away from their late 70's, early 80's sound, and can't understand why they don't write that kind of music/lyrics any more, why don't you go listen to those records, quit bitching, and let the rest of us enjoy the new stuff. It's 2007, so grow up...the band certainly has.   <br /> <br />This is a great disc, with its own unique sound and character.  Sure, it's mostly mid-tempo stuff, but the songs grow on you quickly, and I personally feel this is one of their best discs in years.  I can't wait to see them in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati this summer.   <br /> <br />Long Live Rush! <br /> <br />
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Purchased it the day it came out,as with any Rush album and LOVE it. Of course,everyone will have their own opinion,as in anything else. I like slow stuff and rocking stuff. I think this new album fits the bill very well.Have many fave Rush albums and this one is up there. I wouldn't want to bore you with my past faves,because if you like Rush,most of us have the same tastes. \\"Fly By Night\\",\\"Moving Pictures\\",\\"Signals\\",\\"Hemispheres\\",\\"Counterparts\\",etc.,etc...The standouts on \\"Snakes & Arrows\\"...\\"Far Cry\\",\\"Workin' Them Angels\\",\\"The Larger Bowl\\",\\"Faithless\\",\\"Good News First\\" and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\"(1 of three intrumentals). Real cool album and if you love Rush,which I'm sure you do,if you read this...I think this album will please the most diehard and casual fan.Give it a shot,it won't disappoint.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is the first album I ever got.  I got it in Junior High School from a friend on cassette tape and back then I was a very casual rap fan unlike now, but I have to say I loved it.  I now have the 2001 re-release with 13 tracks.  Every song is a winner and definitely helped propel the rap industry into the G-Funk Era in 1993 and 1994.  Snoop's drawl definitely complements Dr. Dre's awesome melodic funk.  I like this one better than the Chronic, and that one bangs too!  One of my favorite jams here is \\"For All My N----z And B---es\\" where Tha Dogg Pound and Lady of Rage kills the track with relentless gangbanger flows over a bass heavy mobbin beat and loud whiny synths Dr. Dre popularized in the early to mid 90's.  \\"G'z And Hustlaz\\" is interesting, for the beat brings in elements of rock n roll guitars and Snoop kills the track.  He has one of the best flows in the game on this album.  I really can't say much more that what has been already said.  \\"Serial Killa\\" again brings in that whiny synth and Tha Pound and RBX bring so much heat to the table; all 3 kick such mainy flows right out the mental ward, what a classic.  \\"Gin And Juice,\\" \\"Doggy Dogg World\\" are what they are, classic G-Funk that stand the test of time; songs like those were repeatedly looked to for influence on other West Coast and even some southern albums in the mid 90's era.  \\"What's My Name\\" definitely is bouncy, anthemic, and catchy over a P-Funk type sample, another G-Funk stable.  If only rap was as passionate as Snoop, Dre and his guests were in this day of age.  Timeless classic is the best way to sum up Doggystyle.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I will agree with some who believe that his previous albums were better. Many songs were better done by other artist but he is showing some growth in figuring out what HIS sound is. He tries very hard to do something new with older songs and succeeds with some and fails miserably at others. The duets are good for the \\"missing in action\\" group Boyz II Men but seems a bit awkward somehow. (It's good they're finding work) He let me down with the performance on American Idol. The performance was mediocre at best and just him being ON the show was disappointing.  As with the \\"lisp\\" thing. I don't think he really has a lisp but rather uses a softer \\"s\\"  rather than a hard more pronounced \\"S\\".I don't know what the deal is or why it has changed since last album. I HOPE very much that he realizes that his absolute BEST songs are ones he has written himself like Everything (the best song on the album) and Home from It's Time. Do a whole album with songs like that and you'll have a hit record. Still with all the small flaws, he's young and has a long career infront of him, the best for him is still YET TO  COME.
B00005JPCF|1.0|This is a blatant propaganda film aimed directly at an audience that isn't able to evaluate the film for what it really is.  If you have any doubts that conservationism is the new religion, Happy Feet makes this abundantly clear.  The leader of Mumble's group of penguins is styled as an evangelical religious leader who hates science and won't seek the truth, while the protagonist seeks the truth, employs technology and saves the penguin's food supply.  To reinforce the point, the film is sandwiched with a docudrama about dwindling fish supplies and a tribute to \\"saint\\" Steve Irwin, who makes a cameo appearance in the film as the voice of an elephant seal.  Every new religion needs saints, right?  The not so subtle message of the film is that religious belief is bad, while conservation science is good.  Of course, there is no acknowledgment that it is religious belief, specifically Christian religious belief, which requires stewardship of the planet.  Such an acknowledgment wouldn't square with the filmmaker's prejudice.
B00005JKGO|5.0|The theme of this story is the narcissism that causes a group of dissatisfied \\"celebrities\\" and the reporters and journalists who exploit them to create dehumanized lives in the context of hedonistic materialism. <br />This story is culturally valuable because it shows us the lifestyles of \\"celebrities\\" and aristocracy and how standards are formed around those lifestyles. The story reveals a side of \\"the sweet life\\" that is often untold and unnoticed. It serves to remind us what is truly important, and to break up common illusions and misconceptions about the life of glamour. The final scene, in which the healthy young girl and Marcello, with his entourage of misguided celebrities, cannot communicate illustrates the distinction between the two and their value systems.  <br />The glamorous life is not the only thing about which Fellini reveals misconceptions: common understandings of love and religion are also shown to be ineffective and harmful. The scene of the planned \\"miracle\\" is one such instance that shows religious superficial and superstitious practices. In one instance, we are shown a group of the faithful ripping apart a sapling tree just because the Madonna was alleged to have appeared in its proximity. This story exemplifies many facets of humanity that are universal and timeless. <br />The way the elements of style are used serves to increase the worth of the film and intensify the force with which its cultural value is presented. Many of the elements are used with such subtlety that we scarcely understand why we are feeling the way we do until the film is over and we have analyzed it. The dialogue is well-written and telling; however, the other elements of film style contribute as much to our sense of what the film means, if not more. The lighting, editing and sound present to us the aura of the film; alienation, loneliness, boredom, self-centeredness and misery. <br />
1582701709|4.0|I've been a huge fan of the movie, \\"The Secret,\\" which I believe is an outstanding introduction to the principles of the Law of Attraction.  The book is a nice addition to the concepts explored in the movie, but in my opinion, the DVD is a much more inspiring presentation of the material.<br /><br />While The Secret has become a worldwide phenomenon, showing it has incredible appeal for those wanting to improve their lives, it has also received criticism from people who believe it over-simplifies what it takes to make change happen.<br /><br />Readers wanting more depth regarding Law of Attraction books can seek out \\"Ask and It is Given,\\" by Esther Hicks, \\"The Attractor Factor,\\" by Joe Vitale,\\" or \\"Quantum Success\\" by Sandra Taylor.  If you're looking for more science to back up what you're learning, try \\"The Intention Experiment\\" by Lynne McTaggart, or the more spiritual, \\"The Divine Matrix,\\" by Gregg Braden.<br /><br />And, if you're looking for great resources that are not Law of Attraction specific, but are life changing in themselves, try some of the literature in the realm of Positive Psychology (like Martin Seligman's \\"Authentic Happiness\\"), a field based exclusively on what research says works to transform your mind and your life.<br /><br />There's something for everyone out there...we all just need to find the right mix of information, science, and practicality to serve our unique needs.  The Secret is a wonderful introduction to the Law of Attraction principles.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|The latter half of '76- an exciting time in music? Let facts speak! Music- <br />  al acts ,such as  Pilot, StarBuck& Gary Wright(who all have decent songs) <br />  didn't just FLOOD the airwaves, they RULED them! Yes, it seemed as if there <br />  were some secret factory churning out mindless, un-original junk, designed <br /> by an Evil Consortium to turn us into thumb-sucking, disco-grooving autom- <br /> atons, willing to put down hard-earned bread to buy this drivel! Was all <br /> lost? Gems,such as Thin Lizzy's\\"Jailbreak\\", Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' <br /> debut, along w/ the Ramones' debut & JOURNEY'S( There's the poppy \\"journey\\", and then there's the real deal JOURNEY) \\"Look into the future\\" <br />  were just a few rays of light.....until Sept.  That is when the rock n' roll powers that be(And Tom Scholz) gave unto us Boston's debut album! 8 tracks of pure, un-adulterated Rock spun on truly tired turntables, giving <br /> all the message that was clear: ROCK WAS STILL ALIVE! Truly an album that <br />anyone who loves music of any genre needs to own. One of the top 10 albums <br /> of ALL time, hands down, and my personal fave. NOTE: Fran Sheehan is one <br />of the most under-rated bassists in rock history. The fluidity, the mast- <br /> ery of scales, his ability to use fills skillfully, & his ability to keep <br /> in harmony w/ Sib make this a real listening experience (I am a bassist). <br />  Brad's vocals are amazing(You are missed greatly!), Tom's guitar & eff- <br /> ects wizardry blow the listener away right from Track 1, \\"More than a f- <br /> eeling\\"( which has THE greatest intro of All time). Sib's playing gives <br /> the songs backbone( again,another grossly under-rated musician), while <br /> keeping it tight,& Barry's rhythm/ solo work are top- notch. What more needs to be said? If I had to pick the 2 best tracks, I would say they would be : #1- More than a feeling- again best intro, killer riff/solos; <br /> #2- Let me take you hometonight- Both Brad & Fran really shine on this <br /> track. Brad opens himself as both vunerable, yet confident- who hasn't <br /> felt this way around someone they have the hots for? His vocals really <br /> project this feeling,and you find yourself singing along. Fran's bass- <br />  line, basicly a scale exercise, greatly enhances the feel of the song. <br />  So buy. Listen & fall in love once again with Boston- you won't regret <br /> it! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000I0RNV6|5.0|This film recognizes the ennobling effect movies can have on viewers, and then proves this maxim by inspiring tenderness in the viewer. Though the story aptly concerns itself with the bitter effects of war on a family, the modernization of small towns, the distortion of culture, and the loss of young love, its lasting impression is the positive effect a loving mentor can have on the life of an individual despite such hardships. Salvatore's adult life does not reflect much outlet for emotional development, so the audience can infer the importance that his childhood, particularly Alfredo, held for him and his maturity. This loving relationship is most poignant for the audience because it occurs between believable individuals. Neither Toto, nor Alfredo, nor their town is reflected as perfect. Rather, they are all shown to have their flaws, their pompousness, humility and crazy characters mixed in with their beauty, compassion and adoration. This film is well balanced and will warm any audience, at any time, with its ageless story of humanity, regret, growth and love.  <br /> The film style of Cinema Paradiso makes the audience feel the love between Toto and the other characters, particularly Alfredo. Lighting and sound create a storm whose ear-shattering thunder and bright lighting during Salvatore's life review make the audience imagine how deeply he's responding to what he has been told: that Alfredo has died. Also, close-ups of adult Salvatore's face during the same time reveal these deep emotions. The music of Cinema Paradiso is perhaps the most touching element of film style used. Throughout the entire film, variations of the same song are slowed down or sped up during fitting times, and played with varying instruments. This is highly metaphorical, revealing the connection between the bitter and sweet times of life and perhaps, the continuing influence of Alfredo's love throughout Salvatore's highs and lows.  <br />
B00005JPFH|5.0|I just saw this movie today, and I must say, I don't know why so many people disliked this movie. I thought this movie was about as good as the others, but it had much more action and romance.  The ending was okay, but the only thing that completely bugged me, (being a big fan of Venom) is that Venom did not have that big of a part in this movie.  The scenes he was in, though, were great.  In the end I feel that there could possibly be a Spider-man 4, but it will, like this installment, be much more different than the first two films. <br /> <br />Note: This installment is much darker and more disturbing than the other films, but it is not something I think parents should be too horribly concerned about.  Age range: about 7 and up.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The Stones grew leaps and bounds with this album. Their songwriting beginning to reflect social, political and historical substance and their sound returning to a mean, more bluesy one after imitating the Beatles for a few years. This album disssociated the band from the Beatles for good. It was a pivotal album and the beginning of the Stones rule over the rock world. I can hear clear Dylan influences on this record as well as the Stones embracement of the country rock movement that was big around 1968.  <br /> <br />1. Sympathy for the Devil - Timeless classic and greatest Stones opener. One of Micks most charasmatic performances. The songwriting jumps out at you just as much as Micks guise as lucifer. <br />     <br />2. No Expectations - A well written country ballad with some great slide guitar work and an expressive vocal from Mick.  <br />     <br />3. Dear Doctor - Country flavoured singalong with the Stones. Humourous lyrics.   <br />  <br />4. Parachute Woman - Acoustic blues based song with great rhythm.  <br />    <br />5. Jigsaw Puzzle - Mick doing Dylan, one of my favourites here. A winning Jagger vocal and those surreal Dylanesque lyrics. <br />     <br />6. Street Fighting Man - Remains a concert staple to this day.  <br />      <br />7. Prodigal Son - Reminiscent of Johnny Cash, again fantastic rhythm. <br />    <br />8. Stray Cat Blues - Would become the blueprint for the term \\"Stonesy rocker\\" a hint of what was to come on at least the next 4 albums. <br />    <br />9. Factory Girl - Another simplistic acoustic country number with some interesting instrumentation. <br />     <br />10. Salt of the Earth - Fairly underrated album closer with both Keith and Mick vocals. Great lyrics with a social consciousness. The song builds up nicely with some backup singers present. <br /> <br />The Stones excelled with perhaps their greatest effort on the next album, Let It Bleed.   <br />
B000G8NXYQ|5.0|The theme of this story is the compassion that allows close-knit, small-town Italians in the 1930's to lead a meaningful existence in the context of Fascist oppression and economic hardship.  <br />This story is culturally valuable because it shows the beauty of meaningfully existing, unchanged, amid destructive and oppressive forces. When a peacock lands in the snow with its beautiful, vibrant blue and green feathers, it exemplifies beauty, simply existing, within harsh conditions. The point of the story is not that the characters of this small Italian town make any world-altering advances, but rather that they maintain what they already have and admire--their sense of community and individual compassion--despite oppressive odds. Fellini gives his audience mischievous adolescents, oblivious teachers, a \\"crazy\\" uncle, a humorous grandfather, an idealistic and extremely feminine beauty, a generous but sickly mother and her easily-angered husband, dissatisfied workers, a story-telling lawyer, a prince, and a lying snack vendor. And none of these characters is ever treated inhumanely, or as being of any less value than any other. The uncle has an episode in which he climbs a tree and throws rocks at people who try to get him down, all the while yelling, \\"I want a woman!\\" Hours pass and the doctor who eventually comes to get him down remarks, \\"He has normal days, and he has not normal days...Just like us.\\" Through the interaction of these characters, Fellini allows his audiences to encounter a town, the families, a community, and the simple life that exists within it. This film is powerful because it is saying that one does not have to defeat oppression to be worthy of being a model, seen and honored. You have only to live, to be yourself--which means to create--to be something powerful and moving.
B000002ULO|5.0|The sweet waft of nostalgia filled the air when Macca served up this pie. <br />However there is an underlying sense of sadness and impending loss, no doubt attributed to the declining health of his wife, which balances out an otherwise lighthearted Macca pop showcase. <br /> <br />1. The Song We Were Singing - Macca looking back to the past. We always came back to the songs we were singing. Those memories will never cease to be. Its an anthemic song sung by a proud and fortunate artist. <br />      <br />2. The World Tonight - Rocking and had a very modern feel to it when it came out as a single. <br />     <br />3. If You Wanna - Average mid tempo rocker. <br />     <br />4. Somedays - Simply stunning. Heartfelt and contemplative. One of the best songs he wrote. As good as many Beatle songs. <br />     <br />5. Young Boy - Moderately successful single. Find love in any situation. Love the instrumental break at the end, very Whiter Shade of Pale. <br />     <br />6. Calico Skies - Was happy when Paul played this live. It is truly a magnificant and jubilant song. Its what Paul does best. <br />     <br />7. Flaming Pie - A fun rocker. <br />  <br />8. Heaven On A Sunday - Sounds like something of London Town. Adult contempory sounding yet a lovely song featuring his son. <br />   <br />9. Used To Be Bad - A jam with Steve Miller. Dispensable but adds a fun and lighthearted moment to the album. <br />    <br />10. Souvenir - An underrated gospel tinged pop song with a dark and edgy production. Great work from Jeff Lynne. The chorus is great. <br />  <br />11. Little Willow - A tender and heartfelt acoustic performance. Up with his best work. <br />   <br />12. Really Love You - The second jam. <br />  <br />13. Beautiful Night - Power pop. Similar to No More Lonely Nights. A Moderate hit. <br />    <br />14. Great Day - A charming pre Wings sounding acoustic ditty that had been lying around for a while. <br /> <br />Fantastic pop album. <br />
B00000I41J|5.0|This is simply one of those amazing recordings that just about everyone can agree on labeling a CLASSIC.  And if any jazz recording truly deserves this description, it's \\"Somethin' Else\\".  It is my second favorite jazz album of all-time (right behind \\"Kind of Blue\\").  The way Miles and Cannonball play off of each other is truly somethin' special.  It's like watching an old William Powell - Myrna Loy movie, or Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen play basketball, two artists who seem to not only know the other like the back of their hand, but also seem to be able to feed off of one another, not so much in a competitive way, but more of a playful, venerating one.  The result for us of course, is magical!  This classic is a perfect example of why art is so important in today's society.  I can be having the absolute worst day of my life, however as soon as I come home and turn a CD like this one on it's almost as if my troubles seem to vanish within minutes.  Try to it sometime, and see if I am just throwing out b.s. hyperbole.  If you are a jazz fan and this doesn't do it for you, then I don't know what to recommend besides maybe some wine or opium.  It would be like a classic rock fan who doesn't like \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  You might get a few fickle jazz fans out there who prefer different cups of tea, but for the most part (as you can also see by the five-star Amazon rating) this one is a no-brainer as most jazz zealots will agree.<br /><br />This album is just over 43 minutes of pure bliss.  Everytime I play this one I enjoy it more than the time before.  And what's really ironic is the fact that everytime I play it I think the opposite - that I am actually going to be sick of the CD by now because of the many times I've already played it.  That Miles Davis sure had some kind of run during 1958 and 1959.  Has anyone in the history of music (the Beatles included) contributed more in nearly a two year span than this man?  Along with \\"Somethin' Else\\" and \\"Kind of Blue\\" there were also \\"Milestones\\", \\"Sketches of Spain\\", \\"Porgy and Bess\\", etc...  Not too shabby to say the least.<br /><br />So please, if you are new to jazz music, make this purchase right away.  It's not just about Miles and Cannonball, the rest of the quintet, the outstanding rythm section - Art Blakey (drums), Sam Jones (bass), and Hank Jones (piano) - all give inspired performances.  I have never heard Art Blakey so restrained, but it works to perfection on this recording and his performance was perfect for it's subtle, yet soft nature (yes, drums can actually sound serene).  This one deserves to be in it's own category - 6 STAR REVIEW!of Blue\\" there were also \\"Milestones\\", \\"Sketches of Spain\\", \\"Porgy and Bess\\", etc...  Not too shabby to say the least.

B00005UKE0|5.0|A monster of a rock classic. We all know the impact this album had in launching Harrison as a focused and successful individual making it on his own, free from unfair limitations, after the success and break up of the Beatles. <br /> <br />Disc: 1 <br /> <br />1. I'd Have You Anytime - Co-written with Dylan. Lovely slide work with a dreamy countryish vibe <br />      <br />2. My Sweet Lord - Classic! <br />     <br />3. Wah-Wah - Makes alot of noise, a musical thunderstorm <br />     <br />4. Isn't It A Pity - One of George's very best. Pink Floyd would have been listening to this kind of song to develop their successful sound in the years that came after ATMP.  <br />  <br />5. What Is Life - There ain't many pop songs finer. <br />     <br />6. If Not for You - Dylan song. Country love song. <br />  <br />7. Behind That Locked Door - Soft rock/country that George was nailing at the time. <br />  <br />8. Let It Down - Heavy treatment of an exquisite melody from Harrison. <br />     <br />9. Run Of The Mill - Philosophical. <br />     <br />10. I Live For You (Bonus Track) - another soft rock/country song with some brilliant slide work <br />      <br />11. Beware Of Darkness (Bonus Track) - Demo of the song from Disc 2. <br />      <br />12. Let It Down (Bonus Track)- In its best form here. <br />      <br />13. What Is Life (Bonus Track)  - Instrumental. <br />     <br />14. My Sweet Lord (2000) (Bonus Track) - Re-recorded with sublime slide from the master. Passionate yet deteriorating vocals from a man close to death. <br />     <br />Disc: 2     <br />  <br />1. Beware of Darkness - underrated gem. <br />     <br />2. Apple Scruffs - George doing McCartney. Nice harmonica and a catchy tune. <br />     <br />3. Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll) - Haunting feel to it. <br />     <br />4. Awaiting On You All - In your face religious message. To bombastic for my liking. <br />     <br />5. All Things Must Pass - Great song. <br />     <br />6. I Dig Love -Fun number with great piano and a fantastic vocal from George, wow was that George singing? you may ask. <br />     <br />7. Art Of Dying - Futuristic in every sense, Clappers on guitar there. <br /> <br />8. Isn't It A Pity (Version Two)- Reprise, nice version. <br />      <br />9. Hear Me Lord  - Spiritually inclined, very emotive. <br />     <br />10. It's Johnny's Birthday - Lighthearted. <br /> <br />Rocking Jams <br />   <br />11. Plug Me In      <br />12. I Remember Jeep      <br />13. Thanks For The Pepperoni      <br />14. Out Of The Blue      <br /> <br />
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This CD is what Rush should have made when they came out with Vapor Trails! <br />Every song is brilliant. My favorites are Far Cry, Armor and Sword, The Main Monkey Business, Bravest Face, and Malignant Narcissim. The latter which is an instrumental is great although too short. I love that funky bass line, sounds like something Flea from the RHCP's would come up with. I also love the intro to the song The way the wind blows, that blues part is very different from anything Rush has ever done. This album belongs in the top 5 of the greatest albums from Rush!
B000E33VWW|2.0|The only redeeming quality of this film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman and his portrayal of Truman Capote. Everything else is lacking- especially a good cast and storyline.  It barely scratches the surface of events surrounding the killings and its aftermath. It can't hold a candle to the orginal \\"In Cold Blood\\" starring Robert Blake. Those who read the book will notice all the flaws of the film \\"Capote.\\"  one of the worst films of 2006. <br /> <br />
B00005JPFH|3.0|Comic-book fans will have little trouble following the unusually large cast of characters (and their entanglements); nonetheless, fans of the films alone may find themselves a little overwhelmed: Mary Jane Watson v. Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker v. Eddie Brock, Spidey v. Venom, Spidey v. Sandman, Spidey v. New Goblin. The uninitiated may need to bring a notepad! Likewise, comic-book fans will not mind the \\"uncomfortable\\" tension (in fact, many will enjoy it), but fans of the films alone might find it nearly unbearable. Now, Raimi tries to inject humor to deflate the film's tension, but it frequently leaves the viewer (even fans of the comic-book) more perplexed than amused. For example: it is really bizarre to see Venom's \\"emo\\" affect on Spidey ... his black eyeliner, black sweeping hair, and black dress shirts ... like he just fell out of a \\"Panic! at the Disco\\" video. Certainly, comic-book enthusiasts are familiar with this this \\"dark side\\" trope (like red kryptonite's effect on Superman), I personally wish it was done with a little more finesse (something that might stand the \\"test of time\\").    Now for some points on which we all may agree (maybe!) Christopher Young's compositions undermine Raimi's intent. Dramatic battles are completely undercut by his decidedly undramatic score. On a positive note: the acting has remained fairly faithful to the previous two films. Maguire does the best he can with the whiplash script, Franco succeeds in his complex role, and Dunst does a perfectly adequate job. Of course, J.K. Simmons and Ted Raimi rock ... and Bruce Campbell shines (what else would we expect?!) And, needless to say, it is always great to see Stan Lee!!    Some will find that the conclusion is a little too \\"clean\\" (I, for one, agree with that assertion). Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that comic-book fans expect this ending ... it is faithful to its conventions.    Like many of the reviewers here, I was relieved when the credits appeared. It felt about an hourtoo long, relied too heavily on awkward battle-scenes, failed to develop characters, and \\"took the easy way out.\\" And yes, IMDB has Spiderman IV slated for 2009 ... so let's hope Raimi returns to simpler, more intimate plots (if he elects to sign-on for the project!!)     If you're are a fan of the comic-book (or even just the films), see it!! Then return here and weigh-in on the debate!!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I think this CD is the best Michael has done since his self titled debut album Michael Buble.  As another reviewer mentioned it is Michael's tribute to 1960's Vegas style music.  The songs blend so well together on the CD it is hard to tell the covers from the new ones because Michael once again does what he does best blend modern versions of the old clasics with new original songs.  The staand outs are the songs Everything, I'm comming home in which Boyz to Men lend their voices to sing back up to Michal.  Me and Mrs, Jones in which Michael injects passion and soul to a song I never realy liked before I heard his version on this CD.  I am also pleased with the fact that Michael once again has the smile back in his voice.
B00005JPFF|5.0|I have to say Spider-Man 3 was another great addition to the Spider-Man trilogy. I do have to admit I was afraid this movie would not live up to the first two Spider-Man's. I mean those first two were great and how could this one possibly match that? After I finished watching it I can say I was not at all disappointed. I think many people were expecting this to be just like Spider-Man 1 and 2. Spider-Man 3 does take more risks than its predecessors by having more villains than usual, but It still manages to entertain, spark emotion and above all inspire and bring out the kid in many of us. It is like the first two with many of the same characters returning, but where Spider-Man 3 differs is when we get to see the dark side (with the black suit) of Spider-Man which takes the movie to a whole new level. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did a great job as usual and brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, that's what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride that I highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the hype of this movie, or the negative things some critics had to say. I went to see Spider-Man 3 to be entertained and I was not at all disappointed. With a expected DVD and blu-ray release date of November 2007 this is sure to be one great year for Spider-Man fans!
B000M4RG42|3.0|This is one of Clint Eastwood's pair of movies about the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II, the other being \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\".  \\"Flags\\", as you would guess, tells the American side of the story, from both the battlefield and from the homefront as the \\"heroes\\" of the famous picture of Marines raising the flag on the island, are escorted around the U.S. in a last-ditch effort to sell war bonds. Eastwood explores many aspects of the nature of heroism, and what keeps troops fighting, which is often not much about heroism at all.  Wisely, Eastwood employs unknown actors to play the \\"heroes\\". There were a few recognizable faces among the brass and stateside players, but primarily Eastwood lets the story carry its own weight.  There's a good bit of \\"blood and guts\\" especially early on as the invasion is depicted, so I'd limit this one to adults and older high schoolers.
B00005JPFF|4.0|As the story progresses from Spiderman 2, we see a sprite Peter Parker prepared to propose, and a glum Mary Jane, struggling as an actress unbeknown to Peter.  Then we see Peter's and MJ's friend, Harry, once again try to assault Peter, only to lose his memory in the process, and make a return to old times.  Additionally, Peter's schoolwork is excellent, but he's got competition at the office from a young hotshot Eddie Brock Jr., whose all to eager to get a scoop.  Then, we have Thomas Haden Church's character or Flint Marko in the story, running from jail, while still trying to get money for his daughter's medical needs, only to find himself turned into the Sandman early on in the film.  Peter finds out from the police that actually Marko was the one to kill Ben, and soon enough, all of these stories intertwine. <br /> <br />I introduce the film this way one, to be free of spoilers, and two, because in reality the greatest downfall of the film is the entanglement of all the stories together, into what appears to be a relatively coordinated mess.  Mind you I do still like the film, but in this one, I wanted to get my complaint out there early. <br /> <br />Now for my praise, as I felt that even with all of the crossing of story-lines, I did feel a sympathetic ear for the characters, as was intended.  Especially since, more then ever with the introduction of the symbiote, Peter Parker/(the Black Spider) takes a dark turn, and starts ruining his life, among others.  Thus, we were allowed to learn about all the characters, even if there were so many different characters. <br /> <br />Which actually brings me to another complaint, and that's the unnecessary emphasis of Peter Parker's cockiness.  For instance, there's at least a five-minute scene where Peter's just strutting on the street, and sure we get he's changed, but this is quite worthless a scene. <br /> <br />All in all, while the movie ran a little long, and definitely earned some of its negativity, I personally enjoyed the film, and that's all I can say when the lights go up.

B00005JPFH|5.0|The legendary arachnid superhero is back in his 3rd masterpiece as he takes on Venom, the Sandman and Harry the new Goblin and battles internal conflicts. The Best Spidey yet and the best Superhero yet, don't let anyone stop ya from seeing this thrilling and emotionally powerful masterpiece, those people are parasites, go and see for yourself. Venom is the best villian of the 3 movies and in the comics, Sandman and Harry are great too, don't take that Marvel superhero crap that the 3rd X-Men is terrible or any other 3rd Marvel movie. I thought X-Men: the Last Stand was the best of those. Go see Spider-Man 3 and see that's the crowning achievement of superhero movies.

0140177396|5.0|I read it in the 9th grade which was about two or three years ago. I loved it. I thought it very well written. I love George and Lennie. I love George's hate/love relationship with Lennie, and how he takes care of him and look out for him even though Lennie gets him into a lot of trouble. I loved the ending and how Lennie was thinking of the farm that George and him have dreamed about. I cried at the end of the story it was so amazing yet terribly sad. You really connect with how the characters feel at or by the end of the novel.<br /><br />thank you for your time,<br /><br />Loran

B00006JDU9|4.0|This movie would be 5 stars had there not been a few acting problems. First off, Jar Jar Binks was the most annoying character in the entire series of Star Wars movies. Liam Neeson was great in his role, but it was slightly overdone, with a few too many \\"my padawan apprentice\\" and the like. Jake Lloyd did some good acting, but to many of us it may seem like he possessed too much naivete to become Darth Vader so quick. Also, he was a little childish, even if he was only, what? Nine? Ewan McGregor was an excellent choice to play Obi-Wan Kenobi, mainly because he did such a good job, but also that he was able to keep the job throughout the three prequels. <br /> <br />This movie has some of the best special effects and great lightsaber effects, with all the noises timed perfectly. Darth Maul was a nice twist, with his double-bladed lightsaber. He definitely made for a fierce opponent to the Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). The ending fight scenes were beautifully laid out and acted. <br /> <br />So therefore, easily a 4-star movie, but not quite a 5-star.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I live in the Dominican Republic and had to wait until today to listen to the album and i'm very happy that all the bad reviews were wrong.   Thank you Rush for the matureness of your work.
B00005JPD0|4.0|This movie got my attention right away and kept it! It's face paced and has a very interesting story. There are some problems in the story line,but not too much to keep you from enjoying this intense and intriging thriller.
0385751060|3.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" is told from the viewpoint of Bruno, a 9 year old boy who moves with his parents and older sister to Auschwitz where his father is the commander.  Bruno and his sister are sheltered from the realities of where they are and what goes on behind the barbed wire fence - in part by their parents and in part by naievity stemming from their privileged upbringing.<br /><br />Bruno is lonely and imagines that the children behind the fence are lucky because at least they have other children to play with.  He secretly befriends a little Jewish boy called Shmuel who lives within the concentration camp.  They have daily conversations across the fence.  As time passes, Bruno gets more curious about what life is like on the other side of the fence and why Shmuel always looks so miserable.  Shmuel tries to explain how it is to Bruno, but Bruno's sheltered life has not given him any points of reference by which to understand what Shmuel is saying.  Some of these conversations are painful to read as Shmuel is suffering so badly, yet Bruno is so self-absorbed and oblivious to what is happening.<br /><br />I found it hard to believe that a child of Bruno's age could be so unaware of what was taking place in Nazi Germany.  He seemed to have never noticed Jews wearing the Stars of David on the streets, nor even to have heard the word Jew until he hears it from Shmuel.  He meets Adolf Hitler and is underwhelmed by him.  Given that his father is a high-ranking official in the Nazi regime this seems unlikely and it somewhat undermined the book's credibility for me.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is an absorbing book to read.  The ending is brutal.  Throughout the book you know that this story cannot end happily and you are steeling yourself for various outcomes.  Having said that, I didn't see the one that came and it hit me with force.<br /><br />This is a quick and easy book to read, but I don't think I will forget it easily.
0316010669|5.0|Every once in a while someone explains something so well that you can't figure out why you didn't see it before.  Gladwell does this.  I've read and studied decision making quite a bit, and most of it made a lot of sense and was based on good research.  None of it--with the exception of one author--however, explained for me the reason of why people seem to \\"jump\\" to decisions, without following the \\"rules.\\"  This is a great book!  (The other author who explains things this well is Gary Klein (Sources of Power, Intuition at Work), whom Gladwell discusses).

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the most stunning production I've ever seen.  It's a first for the two creators.  People set up cameras in the most remote and unique locations for days if not months on end, waiting to catch a part of nature hardly ever seen.  Then, with a camera designed to slow down what was filmed, we see in amazing speed (or lack thereof), some of the most fascinating footage ever. <br />I love the beautiful polar bears coming out of hibernation and losing their footing and sliding a little.  They are so cute. <br />This is the most superb documentary I've seen, and I highly, highly, highly recommend it to EVERYONE.  I think this is something that every human should watch.  It gives you a great sense of how beautiful nature is and gives you an appreciation for nature and animals and life in general.  This is a purchase you must make.  I love it.
B000055YG6|5.0|I enjoyed all the feedback and interesting comments and points of view about the \\"issues\\" this movie conveys. But a sad truth that we all seem to miss is that the United States is a huge country with people from many different races and cultures all mixed and blended together. Add to this mix a society and culture that thrives on materialism and self-centeredness and you have what American Beauty attempts to communicate and raise our awareness about. <br /> <br />Needless to say, this movie does not portray an \\"American\\" issue, it effectively raises our awareness that IT IS a world issue because of the fact that most nations around the world make up what we like to call our \\"American Society and Culture.\\"  I DO agree with Mrs. Walker when she stated, \\"...it's a sad day when a movie likes this says something this important about who we are as a culture. A sad day indeed...\\"  People like to say that this movie displays an \\"American\\" issue and it thrashes its culture, but it is a sad world out there where all nations and cultures have been \\"sedated\\" with its own desires for personal gain and power. BUT, thank the Lord that there is still \\"good\\" out there, around the whole globe...but we are just too \\"blind\\" to see this subtle beauty that surrounds us daily... <br />
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|The reviewer who gave this one star was basing this on technical difficulties. This is one of the best movies ever made. It was chillingly ahead of its time in predicting the scourge of corporate media. A post-Watergate classic.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1978.  I remember sitting up until 1AM to see them on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert.  Seeing them lip-sync to \\"Xanadu\\" with bloodshot eyes in the early AM, I was hooked.  I saw them in concert at the International Amp in Chicago in 1980 and 1981 and was mesmerized at the sight of Neil's flailing arms.  I quickly took my allowance and bought up the old back catalog and loved it all.  Then came Hemispheres which I adored, \\"Permanent Waves\\" which I loved, \\"Moving Pictures\\" which was cool, and then \\"Signals\\". Which I tolerated.  After that, I bought the albums up to \\"Hold Your Fire\\", every album with high anticipation that led me back to my teenage years, only to be disappointed.  Was it back music?  Maybe not.  Was it cheesy?  Yep. The cheesy synths of the 80s made my stomach churn.  I didn't buy the couple 90s albums, I just refused to put out my money and get irritated again.  I bought TFO and VT, which I thought was a turn in the right direction, but they still seemed kind of lifeless.  I picked up the new CD yesterday and have listened to it 4 times now, and I can honestly say, that for the first time since 1981, I have listened to a Rush album and look forward to hearing it again.  Is it the 70s regained?? No, not even close.  But what this album is, is finely crafted, smooth running songs that have grown on me with each listen.  \\"Hope\\", is the acoustic guitar solo we have been waiting for 30 years for Alex to record.  It is only a shame that it's a hair over 2 minutes long.  I would love to hear him record a Steve Howe type album showcasing this type of acoustic.  Acoustic is a running theme with Snakes, as all of the songs have been crafted on the acoustic, and the tapestries and layers of sound on this album, may be Rush's finest moment on vinyl, I mean plastic!  The other 2 instrumentals on the album rock out, I think they are better than YYZ.  Don't buy this album looking for the next 2112, but listen to it with an open mind (all you old fans).  I think you will like what you hear!
B000UR9T7I|4.0|I don't care what the critics say, or the comments I read on message boards, this is a good Spider-Man flick. The use of CGI is well done and there are numerous funny scenes to lighten the mood a bit. The only slight negative was that some of the scenes did drag on a bit too long at times. The use of three villains was pretty cool. I liked them all, but Venom could have used much more screen time. He should have been saved for the only villian in Spider-Man 4.<br /><br />Well, with an opening day of around 59 million dollars, you reading this have probably already seen it. If not, swing (pun intended) by your local theater now.
0743298020|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable book that draws you into several stories at once and then brings them altogether in a surprising way.  Although some of the plot twists you will see coming, others you won't and they're all interesting.  It's one of those books where every chapter leaves you hanging and wanting to read \\"just a little more\\".  If you picked it up because you thought it would be a ghost story or supernatural thriller, it's not.  But it is great literature and easy to read and enjoy for anybody.  Also makes you wish you could read Winter's works!
0451191153|1.0|I can summarize all of Ayn Rand's books for you. Are you ready? Here it is:<br /><br />\\"I am smarter than everybody else. People who read my books are smarter than everybody else, too. Therefore, since you are reading this book, you are smarter than everybody else.\\"<br /><br />That's it. That's all Ayn Rand ever says. She says it over and over again, ad nauseam, ad infinitum. Now that I've told you everything she says in all of her books, you don't have to bother reading them. Read something good instead. Read _The History Of Western Philosophy_ by Bertrand Russell. Read _Flim-Flam!_ by James Randi. Read _Fads And Fallacies In The Name Of Science_ by Martin Gardner. Read _The Demon-Haunted World_ by Carl Sagan. Read anything you want, but for Pete's sake, don't bother with Ayn Rand and her narcissistic, egotistical, paranoid garbage.

0143038419|5.0|I have been a Super Seeker for decades and have read a gazillion spiritual/mystical books...so many that I stopped doing so for the last couple of years as I thought I'd read it all, seen it all...been there done that.  Fortunately for me I was on a ten day cruise and their tiny library held mostly books I had no interest in but there was ONE book that caught my eye, `eat, pray, love'.  I was entranced, laughed myself silly, was fascinated by Elizabeth's courage, wisdom and daring...and her amazing ability to share on such a deep level...I felt I was in Italy, India and Indonesia with her. What a gift she has.  I now look forward to reading everything she has ever written and am hopeful that she will do a year in three other countries and keep an ongoing journal to share with us.  I wish their was a rating higher than 5! All I can say is Thank You
B000AMJDHY|3.0|I'm not sure if it would be fair to classify Panic! At the Disco as an emo band because there seems to be more influences in their music; for example, an abundance of dominating keyboards here and there. Anyway, after hearing some talk about these high school buddies-turned-rock stars, I decided to see what their album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out had to offer.<br /><br />This is another one of those albums that took a while to really get to the masses, considering it came out in 2005. But what the album has to offer is a whole lot of confusion AND comparison. For one thing, guitarist Ryan Ross wrote all the songs on the album, and when I looked at the lyrics I scratched my head as to what in God's name he's talking about. I mean, I even ask that when looking at the otherwise listenable singles \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" and \\"But It's Better If You Do\\".<br /><br />Another thing is, well, sorry, but it's hard not to compare Panic to Fall Out Boy. Basically, reviewer Kathryn Jago took the words right out of my mouth, but I'll still throw in my two cents. First off, frontman Brendon Urie is a good vocalist and all, but he sounds a little too much like Patrick Stump. Second, you can sort of tell that Panic is signed to FOB bassist Pete Wentz's label because this album also is mostly made up of songs that not only have way-too-long titles, but the titles are never actually said in ANY of the songs. (That's not necessarily a bad thing, but considering how the album is structured, it doesn't exactly HELP matters either.) And while I understand that the techno interlude \\"Intermission\\" is just that, it's still pretty pointless.<br /><br />Panic! At the Disco would be a lot better if they had more individuality, and if Ryan wrote much better material. At this point, if someone asked me for a short opinion on A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, I'd say, \\"Don't sweat it.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000O178BY|4.0|The first two tracks are a lot of random distortion with no vocals; I didn't particularily care for them or the way that they introduced the album. I prefer strong beats and a song that sucks you in from the very beginning. However, once you get past Hyperpower! and The Beginning of the End, the ingenuity and imagination that is uniquely Trent Reznor starts to appear (he also starts to sing). Rather than abstract distortion, there is beautiful fragmentation and calculated funk. I fell in love with the cd after the first two tracks were over.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|What struck me about this film was the interesting debate between theological speculation and scientific reasoning.  Was Emily Rose's death caused by a evil spirit or was it murder?  Laura Linney and Oscar Nominee Tom Wilkinson give strong performances in this very intriguing motion picture.  Director Scott Derrickson does a great job of trying to keep our interest by giving both side of the arguement without trying to insult our inteligence with a ridiculous and predictable storyline.  A more inexperienced director would have tried to shock us with blood and gore, turning it into a forgetable \\"B\\" movie.  By not taking the low road, this film actually becomes rather entertaining and spiritual. Don't let the title fool you.  Give this movie a chance.  You might like it, as I did!

038572179X|5.0|After The Child in Time McEwan went slightly off-course with Black Dogs, Amsterdam and Enduring Love. Despite the awards, critical acclaim and film adaptations, the coterie of fans who have grown with McEwan suspected his powers to be on the wane. Then along comes Atonement. There is no more engrossing, heart-wrenching and insightful contemporary novel. McEwan's social criticism, so skillfully deployed against the ravages of Thatcherism in The Child in Time, here disassembles the arrogance and stupidity of the British upper-classes, the pathos, heroism and squalor of Dunkirk, and the cycle of guilt and forgiveness that writers excise through their work. Both a love story and summation of Britain's 20th century, this novel climaxes with a stunning literary device at once simple and sublime. McEwan is the finest English-language writer and is at the top of his game here. The theme of fractured families struggling against social and psychological oppression, so darkly introduced in The Cement Garden, comes to full fruition in Atonement. Highly recommended, but not as a first introduction to McEwan. Read First Love, Last Rights, the short stories, then go on to The Cement Garden. The journey to Atonement's explosive, wholly satisfying conclusion does not start on the first page of the novel, but decades earlier in McEwan's iconoclastic early musings. Start there, and the experience of Atonement will be worth waiting for, and so much richer.
1582701709|2.0|For anyone who has studied psychology, and especially those with training in psychotherapy, this should NOT be a secret revealed. True, it is a good thing that the popularity of this book will open the eyes of many who may never have taken the time to think about this concept, but in all reality, this book would be better if it were only a quarter of its length. I got very frustrated reading the same message over and over and over and over and over and....<br /><br />Does it help to think positively so that we may see our life's circumstances as a learning and growth experience? Yes. Can I be taller, slimmer, richer, smarter, simply by thinking I am? No. And the question begs to be asked - who decided I would be happier if I were richer, had firmer abs, or a gorgeous man by my side? This book does a poor job of extrapolating the theory beyond these very simplistic (and for me, shallow) goals.<br /><br />We all want what we do not have - some of us are more blatant about this than others, but truthfully, the grass is always greener on the other side. We only want what we haven't got 'till it's ours...<br /><br />If you take what the author says literally (and I fear some people will) you are doomed never to get what you want if you cannot rid your mind of all negative thoughts related to your desires. I have to ask - how is it possible to never have a negative thought about the things we long for? To the author's credit (or is it the editor's credit?) they do make sporadic comments throughout the book to bring reality back into the conversation - how it's impossible to defy the other laws of the universe (gravity, for example). But this piece of writing is nothing more than the manifestation of yet another person having done a good bit of self-reflection, becoming increasingly self-aware and finding that their life improved as a result.<br /><br />If you're really interested in learning how to change your thinking, (and by default, your life) get a book on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or go to a few sessions of individual therapy with a practitioner who uses this modality to help his/her clients gain a better sense of why they cannot find whatever it is they are seeking in this life.r go to a few sessions of individual therapy with a practitioner who uses this modality to help his/her clients gain a better sense of why they cannot find whatever it is they are seeking in this life. <br />
B00005JPAO|4.0|Helen Mirren is great in this role. Is she terribly controlled and a bit flat and generally emotionless? Yes, but that's the character she's playing! The amazing thing is how she can wear the royal facade so convincingly while also giving glimpses of the person underneath it. She's a great actress, in this and many other roles. <br /> <br />What I find particularly striking about this performance is that I actually come away with a more sympathetic picture of the Queen. Yes, more sympathetic. Helen Mirren and the director somehow make it clear that the Queen is burdened, shaped, empowered and trapped by the role she was born into. She was never allowed to be a regular person; yet she is a regular person, even as she's bought into notions of her god-given station in life. All very complicated, and interesting. <br /> <br />That was the strength of this movie to me. All the stuff about how they responded to Diana's death isn't as substantively interesting. Having said that, part of me did enjoy watching James Cromwell doggedly dig them further and further into a public relations nightmare.

B000NVIXFK|2.0|I buy Rush records since 1984, maybe earlier. I own all of their albums and many bootlegs from the various gold eras of the band. Each album Rush record I immediatly go and buy it, because I love the band. Each time hoping in the deep of my heart that the album would give me some of the thrills and joys Rush gave me in the past with true masterpieces. Unfortunatly, each time in recent years I ended up being VERY disappointed. Frankly this thing is boring me. Now each time I see a new Rush album on the shelves I think \\"Gosh, ...another album from Rush ... I know I'll not like it, I feel it, I fear it ... they are 20 euros in the trash, ... but I Know it, I have to buy it ... ok, let's drink this medicine ...\\" and I buy it. But this is not the way one should buy an album from a band he used to love so much. This music Rush is recording recently has no ispiration at all. The last three studio albums are mediocre. MEDIOCRE. This album makes no exception, it is flat, it is the same from the beginning to the end. And you can listen to it, one hundred times, it still sounds the same. Flat. The texture are nice, the sounds are nice, the album is well produced, but one thing lacks terribly: the music. Geddy is singing the same line over and over again for the entire lenght of the album. What a boreeeeeeeeeee! But did the guys listen to what they record before the release? Obviously the guys plays well like they ever did, but it is what they play that doesn't work. I don't want to point out specific tunes because they really sound the same. It is almost incredible, but it is. Glory days unfortunatly are gone. By the way, nothing last forever, we have to admit this magic band has nothing left to give. But there's one good news for me. Luckly, for the next five years I'm okay, .... til the next bad medicine.<br /><br />... march 08 ... and now, what is coming next ladies and gentlemen? ANOTHER DOUBLE LIVE ALBUM, OH YEAH!!!! Another live album Just a couple of years after the mediocre Live in Rio ....!!!! Yes it is exactly what we needed, another double cd live album, Rush never recorded Tom Sawyer live infact!!! A live album after just ONE album! Oh my friends, I'm sure I'm going to hate this band that I used to love so much!Live in Rio ....!!!! Yes it is exactly what we needed, another double cd live album, Rush never recorded Tom Sawyer live infact!!! A live album after just ONE album! Oh my friends, I'm sure I'm going to hate this band that I used to love so much!
0783235380|2.0|Do you remember when that woman in tie dye puts up her left leg in that one tide commercial??? That's EXACTLY what this whole movie is like.  Sandra Bullock, as usual, put up a very strong performance, but Ben Affleck (who in this movie was KINDA HEAVY AND NOT TOO SWEET) was a weak point.  But anyway, back to the Tide analogy.  So in the commercial, the woman gives a little scream, sways back and forth, looks like she's going to be sick, and then instead pulls a rabbit out of the dryer.  Just like this movie because it's not that good until the end, and then JUST LIKE A MAGIC TRICK it all works out in the end.  Still overall, I would call this a weak movie that should best be avoided.... unless you use tide and love rabbits like ME!!!!!

6305882592|1.0|yuck is all I have to say, this is stuff that NOBODY should be subjected to.
0751532711|1.0|I agree with another reviewer who said his favorite part of the book was the first two chapters. Sums it up for me. The rest of the book repeats the mantra - don't indulge in buying material goods - furniture, cars, etc. (guns/butter theory) Save your money. Invest in things that will pay you. Make money work for you; don't work for money.<br /><br />Certainly a lot of wisdom there, however, it's pretty basic.<br /><br />I was troubled by the author's attitude towards the average worker. Somewhat condescending. The author's dad [poor dad] was a college professor. The *second dad* [rich dad] was a neighbor who had invested in real estate and businesses and took young Robert under his wing. Rich dad pointed out different folks in his employ and told Robert \\"you don't want to be like them.\\"<br /><br />And why is that? Because they didn't have the vision to invest? Because they weren't rich? Because they were working in service work? Wow. Kind of harsh.<br /><br />One gets the impression the investor dad [rich dad] worked constantly. A real workaholic. Is that the model we should aspire to? This book uses money as the measure of success. I have a problem with that.<br /><br />College professor dad [poor dad] and others like him who work 9-5 jobs and struggle to support their families were regarded as parents of a lesser ability or lesser vision.<br /><br />The counter-argument might be, well, Robert retired at 47 years of age. I don't know about Robert, but I *do* know about my own life's experience. I am 47, and one of the worst decisions of my life was investing in real estate when I was 22-years-old. My little girls spent too much of their spare time, working alongside mommy and daddy in a crummy apartment building, scrubbing the toilets, cleaning the floors and trying to coerce money from the hands of deadbeat tenants, so we could forward it to the mortgage companies. And then we lost all our money in the late 1980s when Tax Reform of 1986 hit the investment real estate market.

B000FQ4M58|1.0|After his little 15 minutes of fame in the 70's this tired OLD crow releases yet another 'bat out of hell\\" series, I think the majority is over it buddy, I never liked you anyway, let alone your performance in the RHPC, can't you come up with another title to a cd besides bat out of hell, talk about a no talent troll, this indeed is one. this should be made into FREE frisbee's. <br />no more ROTTEN meatloaf PLEASE.
B0007Y08T2|5.0|Having myself started with Character, I've been uncovering the hidden treasures of DT, starting with this one, I'm very happy to say that although Stanne's vocals are a little rough around the edges, they are infused with fantastic lyrics as stated earlier, but most importantly they establish an unforgettable in style.  Aside from recording quality I can see most of these songs appearing on Character.  Guitarwork is tight, and DT is without a doubt my favorite metal band... they don't simply grind charnel house with their guitars, the construct beautiful melody that speeds right along.<br /><br />Though metal fans tend to be fickle, I have to say that the established a specific style with this album, and though they broke from it largely in the future, they've emerged a very mature and competent band that takes these ideas and makes something truly new and original.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|What? Rush has gone MELLOW on us? Is nothing sacred? <br />This CD gets three stars entirely because Rush still writes great songs. And Neal Peart remains among the greatest drummers in rock and roll eternity. But there is way too much acoustic guitar and mellotron for my tastes. My first Rush album was the classic 2112. I have followed them ever since. Vapor Trails was a tremendous return to form. Snakes and Arrows sees Rush becoming almost elderly in comparison.  <br />Diehard Rush enthusiasts will love it. Everyone should take a listen first.
0618680004|3.0|I have read this book from cover to cover and found it informative yet as fun to read as a dictionary.     There are many good references and topics covered that loosely break down into: classical fallacies, modern fallacies, contemporary history, and modern events with heavy doses of Darwin throughout. Dawkins attempts to cover the topic on an emotional level on the last chapter but only loosely stays on topic.    The book for the most part is a summary of content taken from other sources. This includes 20 pages of citations and notes in the back. Each chapter is broken up very well logically but topics tend to stretch on due to tangents. The train of thought leading to each of these tangents follows but leaves the reader with a \\"yawn\\" feeling by the end.    Update:  Christopher Hitchens [[ASIN:0446697966 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]] is vastly more entertaining on this topic but if your just getting started on the theism debate this is a much easier read.
B000065V3H|4.0|Standard unpopular boy dates popular girl to become popular.  This is a classic from the 80s and I still enjoy it today.  It's even fun to laugh at what we used to wear and what our hair looked like back then.  Story line is very good and the acting is good for a group of teenagers, the adults were actually the bad ones in this film.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|Since I was a boy standing on the parapit of the fireplace of our living room and pretending I was conducting Beethoven's 9th as it played on our stereo , I wondered what it was like when Beethoven conducted it completely deaf.  It was rather disturbing to anticipate this during the movie, when they showed him at the end of the choral.  I was deeply moved when I had first read about how afterward unable to hear the crowd's appreciation and only feeling the vibration of their ovation. It was said tears rolling down his face were visable from witnesses.  The movie showed only his nephew crying.  A terrible diversion from what it must have been like.  Beethoven suffered terribly from what they termed as Melancholy. So it was hardly protrayed in the movie and worse could not protray his triumph at the end of his 9th's first exposition. <br /> <br />As many of us growing up listening to Beethoven, were awe-stuck with his genius.  Anybody can listen to Beethoven, or Mozart, Bach and not have any musical background to experience this genius, unlike Picasso or Eistein where it requires some education.  We are instantly attached to him personaly, and therefore need what little we know of him to be adhered to in a movie, even one as fictionalized as \\"Copying Beethoven.\\"  <br /> <br />Lastly, American production of European historical fiction always lacks credualty as the screen writer and director assume the dialogue can be of American accents and modern colloquial.  It is left to the audience to imagine how that they used American expressions like \\"hard-on\\" in German in the 17th century.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Wow. The more I listen, the more I'm starting to think this is one of the greatest pieces of ART Rush has put out since say Grace Under Pressure, but really, it's more than that. This is what all hardcore Rush fans have been waiting for. It's the perfect blend of old and new rush....finally. All the synths of the past decade have pretty much been abandened for alexs superior classic riffs, but with the blend of the circular landscapes they've been crafting for the past 20 years. Amazing. I've been a fan since listning to 2112 in 1980 w/ my old friend Craig Sell smoking the fine Columbian and drumming on pillows in 9th grade, and Snakes and Arrows brings back that same feeling of power and attack, but with more grace. If you want a serious education in musical expertiece, but yet an emotionl journey second to none, I highly recomend this piece of Art. Buy this and you will not be disapointed.

0618680004|1.0|\\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins documents humanities' tendency toward religiosity, which seems to involve taking up a cause and following said cause in a tightly focused, narrow-minded fervor.  Examples of humanities' causes past and present include, but are not limited to, science, environmentalism, God, gods, money, astrology, Creation, creation, George Bush, Republicans, global warming, Faith, gun control, Christianity, the second amendment, child abuse, Judaism, pedophilia, democracy, homosexuality, war, Catholicism, war in Iraq, education, abortion, women's rights, children's rights, fetus' rights, potentially sentient cell clusters, Islam, world hunger, etc.  Are the causes of humanity spirits of the times?  Shortcomings in this work, among others, include nano-technologies, bionics, the socio/economic impacts of immortality, and select secret society histories.   <br /> <br />It is unlikely that this work will substantially accomplish Mr Dawkins' stated purpose to convert the religious to atheism.  A heavier emphasis on human psychology and sociology might have established a valid path leading toward more credence and objective success.  However, after reading \\"The God Delusion\\" one can conclude that humanities' \\"common sense\\", scientific, religious, or otherwise, often doesn't equate to good sense.   <br /> <br />This work is a somewhat entertaining non sequitur sophistry.  We should all look forward to Mr Dawkins focusing his time, intellect and financial resources on humanities' important questions; just how many angels can dance on the point of a needle? <br />
B000002GXS|5.0|My step-dad told me around Christmas time that he was a Tom Waits fan. He had never told me this before, and I was pleasantly surprised. I pin-pointed him as more of a early Tom Waits music kind of guy, so I bought him Heart of Saturday Night. It's a beautiful, fun, jazzy album that never goes out of style. We all had a great time listening to it together as background music. But, as avid Tom Waits fan, I like to sit down and listen to every one of his lyrics. They are stunning and spectacular. This album is a must for anyone who knows what's good for them.
B000MV8AE0|2.0|Why can't Hollywood exhibit any intelligence?  Profit motive only?<br /><br />Well, perhaps one of these days someone there will realize that an accurate movie about what really happened in Beethoven's life would pack 'em in to the theatre faster.  Beethoven's true life, not fabrications based upon marginal and basically unknown love fantasies about him are insults to the movie-going public and the nobility of his person.  I've lost any remaining respect I had for Ed Harris with this movie.  This movie does a great dishonor toward the spirit of a great human being.<br /><br />Think how exciting a movie would be which was accurate in it's depiction of his true talent and inconceivable suffering.
B00005JPFH|3.0|Well I must say I feel like a REAL geek writing a review for a movie that just came out today.  I cannot believe what Marvel is doing to their franchises.  I remember Marvel declared bankruptcy back in the late 1990's because Saban screwed them over.  Well they bounced back with brilliant some movies and new TV shows.  Now, their inevitable financial problems are a grave they dug for themselves.  With recent movie failures such as X-Men 3 (why did people like that movie?), Electra and Fantastic Four (Jessica Alba? Common, Marvel) you know where they're heading.  They have failed to produce a PROPER DVD release of extraordinary television series such as \\"X-Men: Evolution\\" and the 1990's Spiderman series.  Instead, we are being sold these lame DVD \\"volume releases\\" instead of season releases.  Marvel, try and learn something from DC. <br /> <br />WARNING for some minor spoilers: <br /> <br />I'll start with the inconsistencies from the previous movies.  Firstly, wasn't Eddie Brock in the first movie?  The answer is yes, he was (not physically though but he was mentioned being unable to capture a photo of Spider-man by Robby).  So, why was he just recently hired to work for the Daily Bugle?  Also, Spider-man was clearly having trouble with his powers in the 2nd instalment.  He was seen having trouble scaling walls or using his spider-web.  None of these issues are even mentioned in the 3rd film.  I saw that as an obvious opening for Kraven the Hunter and possibly the Neogenic Nightmare story from the very successful cartoon in the 1990's.  So much for that plan. <br /> <br />Now for the inconsistencies of the third movie.  Harry gets a type of amnesia after his fall.  If he lost his short-term memory, why doesn't he know that he's rich?  Harry's butler knew that his father was killed by his own device, yet he doesn't tell Harry, even though Harry has obviously been suffering from this psychological torment.  The comet falling from he sky with the Venom symbiont seemedlike a very forced entry for an amazing villain.  Why couldn't they incorporate the fact the Jameson's son (who is an astronaut that returned successfully from space in the second movie) brought Venom with him on the shuttle they returned in? <br />Speaking of Venom, how the hell does Spider-man realize that loud noises will cause the symbiont to leave its host?  He just randomly visits some church that conveniently had a large bell.  Why did he decide to go there to get rid of the Venom suit?  How did he ever consider that loud noises hurt the symbiont?  Eddie Brock is conveniently at the church while Spider-man is trying to remove Venom.  Marko conveniently sneaks into some top secret physics test site with ease just to get converted into Sandman.  Everything is so conveniently placed.  Another strange point, Mary Jane leaves Jameson's son for Parker at the end of the 2nd movie.  Jameson's not even a little upset at Peter Parker?  Any father would be.  The last fight scene, with the \\"Stop us if you can\\" sign and Mary Jane in danger of falling (yet again) was pretty lame. <br /> <br />I did like Peter's personality change; some parts of it were just hilarious.  The actions scenes were staggering.  Venom falling onto Eddie Brock in the church was really my favourite scene as it was identical to the cartoon series.  The only difference being that Brock was there for a non-convenient reason (he was following Parker). <br /> <br />Well, Spider-man is officially finished.  We could have seen some good sequels but so much for that.  Save the franchise some honour and don't make another Spider-man movie.  The movie cost $500,000,000.00.  I think all that money could have been better spent on a better cause.
B000NA2776|5.0|What can I say, I love this cd! I purchased in on March 18 and listened to it for two days straight while my husband and I worked in the yard, it's now the only thing in my cd player.This cd has you up dancing, almost in tears, and then back on your feet. Mika's voice is so special, you can say he sounds like a lot of people, but to me he just sounds like Mika. I've tried to choose a favourite song and I just can't do it, each song is so unique. Grace Kelly, everyone loves Grace Kelly how can you not, the words are angry but the music is happy, bizare but it works! I have chosen three I listen to most often, My Interpretation, Any other World and ( I think my favourite) Erase. There's just something about Erase that is haunting, I love it. I'm not sure why Over my Shoulder is a hidden trac but it's so beautiful and showcases Mika's voice.  Wonderful Mika, can't wait for the next one! Definately worth the price and then some!
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie. Although it has a sad beginning, it's a wonderfully funny & touching movie. Albert Brooks' character, Marlin, is very funny as the overly cautious (with reason to be) father. And Nemo is a sweet kid, who manages not to seem bratty at all even when he's being defiant. All the main characters are super funny (& endearing) whether in the sea or in the aquarium. Examples: Bruce & friends are sharks that don't want to eat fish (though it's hard to fight their natural urges); and Jacques is a neat freak, so naturally very bothered when they decide to let the tank get filthy in order to force the owner to clean it, allowing them the chance to possibly escape. However, Ellen DeGeneres' character, Dory, tops them all though. She suffers from short-term memory loss (at times, very short-term), which makes for many laughs. And she thinks she can speak whale, which makes even just stating that very funny. One of my favorite parts is when she tells Marlin that they're not the only two ones in here (the ocean, that is). Basically, it's one of my favorite movies.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|The Covenant, as many other reviewers have stated, is what I imagine an animated horror / sci-fi Gap poster would look like. Lots of skinny kids dressed in designer clothes, fitting neatly into perfect teenager sterotypes, and speaking in robotic brain-dead two-word sentences.<br /><br />The entire movie feels as if its based on every stereotype they could squeeze into the film. The incesant rain and thunder, the long haired \\"bad-boy\\" biker, the clean-cut athletic jock protagonist, the blonde just-transfered-in and is perfectly innocent protagonist's girlfriend, and the list goes on... its really quite laughable.<br /><br />And don't worry about the plot. If you felt you might be missing something in the story line, it's just not there. I will say, however, that the plot could have been interesting. A continuation of the blood line of witches prosecuted in the Salem Witch Trials could have been a fertile start to an interesting story. But its not. Its only as deep as the two-word long sentences that plague the dialogues let it be. It's extremely predictable as well. Having never watched the movie before, you will probably find yourself mouthing the next line from each character.<br /><br />The only real plus for the movie is the quality of the special effects which is on par with most sci-fi movies today. Though the cinematography turns around and quickly kills what the movie had going for it. How many times can a viewer watch a Mustang GT or Ducatti motorcycle whizz by before they start thinking its rediculous? I'm not sure, but they attempted to find out in this film. There are also way too many \\"set the scene\\" shots with the camera floating aimlessly around looking at buildings and trees and butterflys and little kids picking their noses. Ok, so I'm exagerating a little but these scenes really are used too much in the film. I guess they were looking for filler since the dialogue wasn't going to provide it.<br /><br />The final fight scene was also about as unoriginal as could be produced. If it had been set in the middle of a city, it would have been a direct copy of the third Matrix movie. The endless knocking each other back and forth and flying through walls with nobody ever seeming to get hurt. Sure they act shocked and grunt and moan... but how many walls can a guy go through before he's had too much!?<br /><br />I know I'm knocking this film around about as much as the antagonist and protagonist do to each other in the final \\"fight,\\" but that's because its horrible. My honest opinion is that the underdeveloped plot, brain-dead dialogue, and rip-off scenes were all written / copied by a 15 year old kid because most of the elements of this movie would appeal to someone that age. Everyone else will just laugh at how horrible it is and then flip over to an episode of \\"Everybody Loves Raymond.\\"s unoriginal as could be produced.

B000002OX3|3.0|This is probably the worst Who album of their first decade, simply because the whole band was encouraged to write songs. Now, with Pete and John, that's fine: Boris the Spider, Whiskey Man, Run Run Run, So Sad About Us and the mini-opera title track all rule. But it's in the other two's songs where this falls apart: I Need You and See My Way are two of the wimpiest, most sterile Who songs ever, Cobwebs and Strange is stupid, but not in the \\"stupidly fun\\" sense, and their cover of Heat Wave is as bad as the two James Brown covers from the first. And Pete's Don't Look Away falls in the same category as the Keith and Roger songs. So if Townshend and Entwistle had written this whole album together, it would've been great. Now it's only lousy. And Happy Jack should've been made a part of the UK LP as well as the US one...
B00005JPFH|3.0|It was a fun movie to watch, plenty of action - a few laughs here and there.  in other words a popcorn movie that probably needs to viewed in the theaters. <br />Having said that ... I do have some suggestions that would have made this movie better. <br />1. the beginning ,where MJ and Parker are so in love and then MJ gets fired and Parker just can't understand her feelings and then Spidey gets the key to the city,  it all needs to be cut out of the film - bad acting and writing. <br />2. Harry vs Peter = LAME-O .... a small little scuffle in the beginning then it just laughable the way their whole relationship  develops throughout the rest of the movie. Though James Franco was a lot less stiff in this one.  I'm not sure how this would've been better approached to make it less silly,  maybe killing off Harry during that first scuffle would have satisfied my bloodlust,  hey Lucas killed off Count Duku off in the beginning of the 3rd Star Wars, maybe it would have worked here too. <br />3. What is with the friggin Mask???? Since the second installment Spider-Man can't seem to keep his mask on.  In 2 it was ridiculous how much he didn't have it on.  In 3, same thing  it was off more than it was on,  i think he carried it in his hands more than actually  wearing...and when he did wear it, it needed to be ripped or torn so parts of Toby Maguire's face always showed,  i forgot what the mask looked like by the end of the movie. <br />4. Less to zero Sandman,  the guy from \\"Wings\\" didn't do a bad job, it was just more time should have been spent on the Eddie Brock/Venom story.  Venom is a superior character.  <br />5. The end battle was a little too silly for me,  but take away Sandman and the Goblin.  A one on one with a Spidey and Venom battle royal would have sufficed.  Too many people were fighting,  I found it suffocating and pretentious. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the other 2 then you'll love this,  probably the best of the lot.  But after watching this one,  I'm not sure doing a 4th one would be a good idea - there not a lot of places left to go with this character, unless maybe \\"Carnage\\"
B0000AUHOH|2.0|The premise for the Final Frontier, where the ultimate advanture is of the supernatural, where we as human seeks the purpose of life, wow what a storyline huh?  I give Mr.Shatner credit for taking a risk of combining the almighty with sci fi as they are truly going where no man has gone before. I like the friendly humor among the big 3...Bones, Spock, and our favorite capitan, Kirk but the whole plot of just too wacky to be believable for the sane that i do not know where to begin so why bother. I do suppose those of faith would be curious in how it would end but the rest of the masses just don't give a hoot. And Kirks directions might be acceptable for his tv show but not so for a motion picture of this magnitude but then again, even with the capable Spock directing it, might not be enough to save this movie from being the worst of the best.<br /><br />Do i recommend the Final Frontier?  Unless ur a big trekkie fan who would watch anything involving the world of trek, just skip it and check out the Undiscovered Country, a great closure to the original series (TOS).
B0002N4U1A|4.0|I'd never heard of Amy Winehouse until searching on Amazon, got curious, and click a link for \\"Back To Black\\" ... After listening to just 2 snippets, I had no other choice but to buy the album. And B2B is still in heavy rotation till this day. <br />If you're expecting another \\"Back to Black\\" this isn't it. It is however still good, creative, thoughtful, and imaginative. She has a tremendous amount of soul, and it's evident in a number of tracks. My favorites are:  <br /> <br />Stronger Than Me <br />Know You Now <br />F*** Me Pumps <br />I Heard Love Is Blind <br />Moody's Mood For Love <br />Take The Box <br />What Is It About Men <br /> <br />There are no 'Bad songs' on the album, either you like it, or it's okay.  <br />NOT at all better than \\"Back To Black\\", but not a disaster either. If it's your first listen, it can tend to sound all over the place, from R&B to jazz, to Blues to !!!!! She seems to have a song for every emotion and incorporates them in the creative spectrum, often leaving you laughing at her sense of humor. You could never regret putting aside 60 minutes to give it a listen. I haven't.  <br /> <br />Given this album, and Her Sophomore album \\"Back to Black\\" you can't help but sit and wait with bated breath for the third chapter in her story. And with all honesty, with her talent and soul, she could make some of these american artists look silly. <br /> <br />If you have the time, another song you may want to look up from Amy is \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" From the [[ASIN:B00069MOIQ Bridget Jones's Diary, Vol. 2]], an EXCELLENT remake of the supremes' version. She definitely does the song justice, And I'm extremely hard on remakes, mainly due to a lack of originality and talent with some artists today (See Ashanti). <br />If you can't find frank or this single, feel free to contact me.
0307346609|3.0|The world is quickly getting overrun with zombies. They bite living humans; those humans eventually die and are reanimated at zombies themselves. The only way to kill them is to separate their brains from their bodies. Cutting off all their limbs or disemboweling them won't do it; they'll keep dragging their bodies along, in their continual quest for warm bodies to snack on.<br /><br />This is the basic problem in World War Z. Which brings up the first point of anatomical puzzlement (one of very few): if the brain is vital to keeping the zombies going, then wouldn't severing their spine also do the trick? The book makes it a point to note that a human body is just a bunch of meat with a command-and-control unit attached, and once that c-and-c unit is gone the body is, too. But command-and-control isn't much good without a way to get messages from the general to his troops, so to speak.<br /><br />Getting hung up on that kind of detail, though, would doom this book. And in any case, Brooks is very good at tying up the loose ends. The zombifying virus changes the bodies' chemistry somehow, so that they also don't need food or water. For that matter they don't need oxygen, leading to what I found one of the most effectively terrifying images throughout the book: swarms of zombies lying on the ocean floor, their undead hands glancing off nearby swimmers, or pulling unlucky ones down. By the time of the book's writing (it's a look back at the Zombie War, after humanity has started to win against the zombies), there are millions of zombies lurking beneath the waves, and the next generation's children have long since learned to stay away from the water.<br /><br />What are the consequences of a zombie takeover? Brooks takes us around the world to answer that question. Borders are hastily closed off to outsiders, leading to a few missile exchanges and eventually all-out nuclear war between a couple of the combatants. People get in their cars and head out into the hinterlands, quickly running out of gas and abandoning their vehicles on the side of the road. (This leads, coincidentally, to one of my moments of disbelief: as it turns out, the zombies do not have the complicated motor skills to open car doors. Hence if they die in their cars, they cannot get out. As far as I can tell, Brooks invents this constraint to motivate one particular, highly effective, scene midway through the book. But again, we set aside our disbelief and move on.) They head for the sea and take any boats they can...but the zombie virus has already infected some of them, and of course there are those murderous zombies waiting below the sea in shallow water to drag the boaters down.<br /><br />Others head for the north, where the zombies freeze motionless during the winter. They're trained to expect that someone will come and save them, so they act like the German army invading Russia and don't plan for the winter; they expect the zombie problem will be licked by then. Consequently many of them freeze, and [follow your Jack London imagination].<br /><br />Brooks is mostly great at visualizing where the story should go. As my friend Chris (who encouraged me in the strongest terms to read World War Z) says, Brooks could probably write a 600-page book in place of this smaller one. The longer story would expand on places where Brooks had to rush: he was forced to pack an entire world's worth of zombie stories, spread over 10-odd years of fighting, into 340 pages. So I don't fault him a certain economy of style, with any clunkiness that that caused.<br /><br />WWZ starts as Lord of the Flies on a global scale, with governments and individuals all huddled around the same campfire. \\"Fighting the last war\\" fails: all the high-tech weapons the U.S. military has stockpiled with zest count for naught, and we have to return to shooting bad guys between the eyes with pistols or lopping off their heads at close range. Our sedentary American lifestyle fails, and those who buildthings with their hands for the rest of us are suddenly our superiors. Had Brooks kept this arc going throughout World War Z, it would have been perfect.<br /><br />As it is, I'm afraid it degenerates into what Chris calls a \\"war procedural\\" -- though Chris's claim is that WWZ never reaches this point, whereas I claim that it does. The last half of the book is \\"grunts\\" talking about the details of which particular bit of ordnance they threw at the bad guys, and how their tactics changed, and oh my god the military acronyms. So many acronyms. Brooks has read too much Tom Clancy; I have as well, which is where the nausea of recognition came from. Had he made the single decision to not interview a single soldier in the final half of the book, the book would have been saved from disappointment. As it is, I left it feeling let down: not upset at having read it, but also not inspired to reread it.se who build things with their hands for the rest of us are suddenly our superiors.

I will be disappointed if they are not rewarded for the talent and intelligence evident in this film. After the Wedding is so honestly human that it does indeed break your heart. Happily it also hands you hope, a little laughter, and moments of tender warmth and love.

038073186X|5.0|Wanting something beyond the ordinary suspense thriller, I asked for a recommendation and was not only pleased, but thrilled!  For me, the story started out a little slow.  However, by the middle I was hooked and scrambled to get to the \\"Sixth Sense\\" style finish.<br /><br />If you reread the book after knowing the ending you can pick apart the story line, but isn't that true of every book or movie?  If you are interested in an enthralling story with a blow your mind ending, this is the book for you.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|Is there any difference between these CD's and those issued in the Perception box set? Thanks.
B000O1799U|5.0|I don't know if it's because I grew up in Michigan during the 60's or what, but from the first note from the \\"Dreamettes\\", I was hooked!  This movie has great music, wonderful performances, and tremendous energy.  It's the story of a trio of young women from Detroit and how they made it to the big time.  It tells of their days as backup singers for James Early (Eddie Murphy) to their promotion as a group by manager Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx).  It chronicles them falling in and out of love with self-centered, ambitious men who are only looking out for themselves.  When Jennifer Hudson sings \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" the world stands still and the viewer feels all the pain of a young woman being betrayed in her love life and her career.  This is a fast-paced, totally absorbing movie and I highly recommend it!
B0000AUHPK|3.0|how some people say this version surpasses the 1939 version is beyond me....id really say its 3 and 1/2 stars......the pacing is just too fast...it all happens too fast...they fit the entire novel into an hr and 46 mins....we barely have time to FEEL the love between cathy and heathcliff before she marries edgar ..heathcliff comes back..cathy dies....it just happens so fast before we can really connect to the lovers...Fiennes is brilliant and is what really keeps u interested in the film....Binoche is ok but to me pales in comparison depthwise to Merle Oberon....just watch the scene where Cathy discovers Heathcliff runs away...in the 1939 version it is pouring rain and u can actually FEEL the pain and longing to have Heathlciff back.....makes me cry everytime...but this one Binoche barely seems to shed a tear or show any emotion in what should be one of the most emotional scenes of the film.......and the other actors in the film dont compare to those in the original..........still the film is beautiful to watch..contains great scenery on the moors.....and a wonderful score as well..id love to have the soundtrack....it just isnt as moving as the original.......but worth watching for a great performance by Ralph Fiennes
B00005JO9J|5.0|Whether you are a new Grey's Anatomy convert, or were a fan from the beginning, the show is indeniably addictive, entertaining and very well written.  If you are interested in seeing it from its start (for the first time, or all over again), this is truly the way to go.  I don't want to elaborate on tantalizing plot twists or character quirks, here.  That is something you should take the time to see for yourself, and I don't want to ruin anyone's viewing experience!  I will say that the life and times of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Dr. Derek Shephard--AKA Dr. McDreamy (Patrick Dempsey), Intern Christina Yang (Sandra Oh), and the lot of them are funny, at times quite fantastical, and thought-provoking.  Give this first DVD a try, and I guarantee this will only leave you wanting more!
B00005JPFH|5.0|This was the best spiderman movie! The acting was amazing, the action was exciting, and the villians were downright evil! The three villians in this movie were the Sandman, Venom, and the Hobgoblin! Venom was hands down my favorite villian because he was coldblooded, which is exactly how a good villian is! This movie is awesome! I saw it the day it came out because I was so excited!
B000O178BY|5.0|Trent Reznor pretty much invented and defined early industrial music and nearly singlehandedly created a genre. It is fitting, perhaps, that with the release of \\"Year Zero\\" he redefines it's possibilities and uses it to deliver much-needed political protest they way only he can. Both artistically and musically, this is perhaps the best industrial album ever created.<br /><br />Full of Reznor's trademark fear and loathing, this album reaches greater heights because of it's conceptual nature. Although he has covered this ground before (The excellent \\"Downward Spiral\\" was certainly conceptual in nature), this time around he delivers a vision of a full-fledged dystopian near-future America, in which Christianity is the official state religion, citizens are under surveillance by the \\"United States Bureau Of Morality\\", and mysterious aliens may have finally decided to wipe us out like the virus we are. Compelling and topical stuff.<br /><br />Musically, this disc delivers the nihilistic machine-like weirdness the way only Reznor can. Full of the requisite programmed drumming, off-kilter distorted guitar riffs mutated and bent beyond recognition by signal processing, and throbbing bursts of static and nearly (but not quite) recognizable noises and sounds, this may be the first \\"progressive\\" industrial album. Very, very cool and original, even if you don't like NIN. Recommended.
B000O178BY|5.0|Basically, if you love or even like NIN you're gonna feel the same way about this album, despite it's a little different in content to previous records, it's actually kinda refreshing. The songs that don't jump out at first definitely grow on you. There are a lot of songs or parts of them that I just say \\"wow, Trent did it again\\" because its just like what you expect from an NIN melody. 99% of music these days is crap with a nice beat, this album is part of the remaining 1%. Must have for any NIN/true rock fan.
B00005JPFF|3.0|Sometimes, a movie is overhyped & it faces the risk of underwhelming the audience. This franchise was excellent under the guidance of Sam Raimi & I had my reservation if it's going to have an uneventful death as XMen3.  Fortunately, Spiderman 3 is still good when it could have been an outstanding classic. One outstanding trait from Sam is that he seldoms portrays the villains as two dimensional but that they are portrayed as victims of their circumstances.  This is intact for the third offering.  However, a better editing or a tighter script could have ironed out a few lull spots particularly Parker's relationship with Mary Jane which tended to drag on. In the cinema, I could see a large number of audience shifting uncomfortably looking for some actions.  The editor of the Daily Bugle is naturally the comic relief for this offering & so was Bruce Campbell from the Evil Dead.  I'm glad that the twists in this movie isn't revealed or else it would spoil the fun of others who haven't watched this movie.  Having said that, for comic book fans, you probably know already.  I do pick up nice messages from this movie, that ultimately, all of us have a choice in life.  At times, we might have lost our way but then, we need to persevere & we need to have self belief to bring the best out within ourselves.  This is arguably one of the most expensive movie ever made and it shows.  The final climatic battle is worth every penny.  Commendable watching.
B00005JPAO|2.0|I had great expectations for this film but I was disappointed with it.<br /><br />I actually thought that the Tony Blair character was better acted than the Queen character acted by Helen Mirren. (BTW, I think Meryl Streep got robbed of another Oscar). The Queen's character is flat and one-dimensional and as the viewer, one cares nothing about her so-called internal struggles.<br /><br />The cinematography was nothing special, the score was practically nonexistent and definitely forgetable, and the MTV-like connecting of real television images and the actors was not a smooth and seamless presentation.<br /><br />And then there's the story itself....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.<br /><br />I'd skip this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly really shows what's wrong with the Fox network.  This was easily one of the best shows on television when it came out, and if given the chance to grow into its potential, could have been so much more than it was.  What is presented here is the complete series, including the episodes not seen in the U.S. until after the original run was over, along with the behind the scenes stuff that adds to the show. <br />If you are a western fan, a science fiction fan, and even a comedy fan, there is something here for you!  I was very surprised when I found this for a reasonable price, and quickly snatched it up. <br />For a show to STILL have people talking so many years after its premature demise is really a credit to Joss and his writing team.  Very different characters color a future that is both classic, futuristic, Chinese (watch the series, you'll understand) and funny.  Gone are the pristine, military ships of Star Trek, instead you get ships that have debris on them, aren't too pretty, and basically look like HOME to a crew.  Don't take that as a bash on Star Trek, I love Star Trek, but I also love the crew of Serenity.  Why another network doesn't jump on this show and take it to the next level is beyond me.
B000002HPV|5.0|The whole world knows Bjork for being that crazy lady who attacked an interviewer, having worn a swan dress to a awards show and apparently being completely alien to this world. Although I agree her voice is eiree I wouldn't quite describe it as alien. After all she does sound very Icelandic. After two brilliant albums that shook musical boundaries Bjork returned with her true masterpiece \\"Homogenic\\". One thing always puzzles me about this album. Why didn't it sell? The production is flawless, the songs are Bjork's most dramatic (and that's saying something) and it leaves a strong impression after being listened to. Though the songs are a bit odder than on 1995's \\"Post\\" or her \\"Debut\\", they aren't so far out to alienate fans.<br /><br /> The album starts off with one of Bjork's most important songs, \\"Hunter\\". The production and delivery of this song are truly original. The electronic beat is incredibly catchy and different and Bjork sings in a more focused way than usual. The string arangements blend perfectly with the electronic beats and the lyrics are effective. The dreamy \\"Joga\\" is another true masterpiece. Bjork's voice amplifies all her emotions into this song. \\"Bachelorette\\" similarly is a dramatic moving piece with an epic feel. The album progresses through sadness to complete anger as shown on \\"Pluto\\", arguably Bjork's angriest songs. Some call this song unlistenable but I think it provides some much needed anger into the album. It is quite similar in style to \\"Declare Independence\\" from \\"Volta\\". \\"5 Years\\" is another angry song that becomes better with each listen. This song is nothing short of genius. The albums climax \\"All Is Full Of Love\\" takes us back to a much calmer Bjork, as though she vented all her anger out through the album. The song symbolises rebirth and is a beautiful way of ending the album. This song also gives us a continuation to the album after it \\"Vespertine\\".<br /><br /> The album holds together, almost as a concept album. It shows us a side to Bjork which isn't present in any of her other albums. This apparently is the album where Bjork reverted back into her shell, however, I feel this is her most important album to date. Although some of Bjork's albums take a lot of time to get used to (\\"Debut\\", \\"Vespertine\\"), this one grabs you on first listen and won't let you go. This is a masterpiece.<br /><br /> Download: \\"Hunter\\", \\"Joga\\", \\"Bachelorette\\", \\"All Is Full Of Love\\".which isn't present in any of her other albums.

0451191153|5.0|The topics that Ayn Rand chose to write about are dense. Her books make every woman or man think about their potential. Society is challenging and Rand paints a picture of people who face the challenges and succeed. There are a few books that I believe everyone should read within their lifetimes and Rands work (collectively) are among them. These books will challenge your views of society, politicts and potential.
B000002H70|5.0|this is the best album the cure ever recorded every song is great ,i wish i could give more than 5 stars.
B00005JPFH|5.0|This movie seemed to involve a great mixture of action, love, friendship, comedy, and forgiveness. Spiderman does quite a bit of fighting in this movie and for the most part these scenes where quite impressive. The new goblin was great to see but I was disappointed that he did not wear the same wicked costume his father wore in Spiderman 1. Sandman was really impressive in this film and the cgi work done with him was amazing. The sight of Sandman being as tall as a New York city skyscraper was astounding and amazing. On the other hand, Venom was a disappointment to me. I have to say Venom was cool to look at only when he is actually seen with the Venom face. Every time Venom speaks, he uses Eddie Brock's face. I think this really took away the fear and impressiveness of the Venom character. Spiderman of course fights his inner demons in this movie as well. This movie also involves an ongoing love story between Peter and MJ. There is also the friendship between Peter, Harry, and MJ. In Spiderman 3 there seems to be quite a bit of comedy, which was done very smoothly as usual. Although this movie involves many different elements, the main theme in this Spiderman 3 movie is forgiveness. The only thing I did not like about this movie is some of the characters do not act like their usual selves.  This makes the movie somewhat weird to watch at times. I had to keep reminding myself that I am watching a Spiderman movie. Overall, this movie was a great emotional adventure filled with great action that tells the ongoing story of Spiderman.

B000NA1OXY|1.0|I'm so happy that people are finally starting to realize that Avril Lavigne is completely and utterly talentless, she's a complete disgrace to music.  Her music is horrendous garbage and her lyrics sound like they were written by an angry 10 year old who failed English class.  Please do not support garbage like this, buy real music, go search for indepedent rock bands, anything, please there is so much good real music out there, the fact that people waste their money buying trash like this makes me so sad.  PLEASE BUY OTHER MUSIC, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BS.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|A wonderful gift for all movie lovers around the world, Giuseppe Tarnatore's deserving Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Language Film has been (and I believe will be) loved and admired by the viewers regardless their age, gender, native language, and the country they grew up and saw their first movie in the theater, be it a huge multiplex or the modest cinema in a small village.<br /><br />\\"Cinema Paradiso\\" takes place in a postwar Sicilian village and tells about a friendship between a projectionist in the local cinema of the title, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret, one of the best French character actors whose career spanned more than half a century and who was equally good in the surreal satire, light comedies, moving dramas or revenge war movies) and the little boy Salvatore or Toto whose father had died during the war. Since his childhood, Toto was fascinated by the movies and spent countless hours in the projection booth with Alfredo who had become the boy's friend and the mentor. After a fire blinds Alfredo, Toto becomes the projectionist, and the Cinema Paradiso continues to attract all villagers and to bring them together on Friday night to experience again and again the miracle of film. The boy's obsession with film becomes a lifelong love affair which will make him eventually a famous and successful filmmaker.<br /><br />Deceivingly simple and straightforward, the film is always moving, tender, touching, full of humor, love and compassion to its eccentric characters but what makes is special and unique, is the fact that we the viewers, all of us can and do relate to the story because we relive our own childhood movie experiences while watching the film. My memory took me many years and thousands miles back to the time when I was 5 and my grandmother took me to the theater for the first time. She later told me that she had been afraid that I would've became bored, restless, and started to cry - it never happened. I was so charmed and fascinated by what was happening on the huge screen that I sat not even moving, mesmerized and not uttering the single sound. Since that very moment, I have been always ready for the miracle to happen again. I expect every new movie to be great; I want to love, to cherish and to adore it. When it happens and the movie becomes mine, I am the happiest person in the Universe. It did happen tonight when I was watching Giuseppe Tarnatore's \\"Cinema Paradiso\\", one of the best films about the power, beauty, and magic of FILM ever made.happening on the huge screen that I sat not even moving, mesmerized and not uttering the single sound.

B000L212HC|5.0|The movie was a bit choppy, alot of shifting timeframes, but if you stick with it I think it was one of the better movies in recent years.  Christopher Nolan's darkness protrudes through the scenes while Bale plays another terrific double character.  I would recommend the movie to any of my friends and it plays wonderfully on blu-ray.
B00005JPGO|5.0|If one were to want to know about the history of Africa and how the diamond industry helped to influence a \\"Hitler like\\" attempt to extenction, than this is the movie for you. I definitly recommend the two disc set as the documentary on the second disc is the best I've seen to date that is about blood diamonds. Not even the National Geographic documentary is as insightful or entertaining. This movie represents what hollywood could do to help bring some general knowlege to the average public, without having it be too,.... instructional. I believe this movie will have a surprising affect on most people whom see it.
B000002B35|5.0|I was first introduced to Pink Floyd's \\"Pulse\\" by renting the concert DVD as a suggestion from a friend.  Let me just start by saying that the DVD was so good, that I immediately went down to the store to by it.  After watching it a few times, still in awe, I then went out and bought the 2 disk CD set.  No doubt this DVD and CD set is the best concert work of Pink Floyd I've ever seen or heard.  Even with the absence of Roger Waters they seem to hit every note to every song to a tee.  I find that it's impossible for any aging band to try to sing there songs as good as there original LP recordings.  In this concert they did!  A must have if you're a Pink Floyd fan and I believe you'll get more enjoyment if you buy both the DVD and the CD.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret book is a great tool for understanding and using the Law of Attraccion. In my opinion, the book is much better than the movie since it provides much more detail about the discoveries of Mrs. Byrne and of course about the input of the participants. <br /> <br />This book is a jewel, very easy to read, very clear and friendly. <br /> <br />No one should miss it!!
0743289684|4.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali, born in 1969 in Mogadishu, Somalia, to a polygamist Columbia University anthropology degreed literacy teacher father and a recently divorced mother of one, matter-of-factly tells the story of her displacement-prone life. At two, her father is imprisoned for political reasons. Three years later, she and her siblings undergo circumcision. She is regularly beaten by her mother and verbally assaulted by her grandmother. More often than not, her father is absent. Upon escaping from jail, he moves to Riyadh, they to Mecca until they can go to him. They are especially disadvantaged by his absence, lacking a requisite adult male to escort them in public, and immerse themselves in the practices and traditions of Islam. Deported in 1979, they move to Ethiopia, later to Nairobi, Kenya. After receiving secretarial college certificates in 1989, she and her sister return to Somalia, the place of her first of two brief marriages. The following year, the sisters become refugees in Nairobi. Her father arranges a second marriage. En route to her husband's adopted country, she chooses divorce and life in Holland. On the letter apologetically informing her father of her decision, he scribbles a disowning reply, telling his \\"deceitful fox\\" daughter to go to that really hot place. Although tracked down, she stays put, translates for a living and studies political science. She begins questioning her faith, especially the tenets requiring the submission of female followers, suffers the wrath of members of her former faith after politicking against certain pro-Moslem government practices, speaks out against Islam, and is forced into hiding. Much can be learned from her meandering and sometimes rocky path towards, amidst, and in retreat from Islamic enlightenment. Recommended companion read: The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright.

0743298020|5.0|First Sentence:  \\"All children mythologize their birth.\\"<br /><br />Margaret Lea is a young woman working with her father in an antiquarian bookshop.  She receives a request to write the biography of the famous author, Vida Winter.  Although Ms. Winter has been interviewed many times, each time she gives a different story of her past.  Now she has decided to tell the truth.  The story draws Margaret into Ms. Winter's life and she discovers tragic parallel in their lives.<br /><br />Ms. Setterfield begins her writing career with a completely mesmerizing, although not altogether pleasant, story within a story within a story.  The top story is Margaret's narrative.  It is lyrical and speaks to the heart of those of us who love books.  There is the story of Angelfield which is grim and rather unpleasant.  There is third story which is sad but is one of survival.  I both read the book and listened to the audiobook.  The book is wonderfully written; the audiobook narration adds a richness and deeper emotion to the story and left me crying with its ending.  This book won't be to everyone's taste, probably best for those of us who love gothics.  It will definitely be on my 2007 top reads list.
B000IY06CK|4.0|Julia Fischer gives excellent performances of the Tchaikovsky works for violin included in this CD.  In the Concerto in D, she gives a sensitive and well-naunced reading.  Her reading of the Seranade melancolique and the Valse-Scherzo are first-rate.  But the real joy, for me, is her performance of the Souvenir d'un lieu cher.  Julia Fischer's reading of the Meditation (the original slow movement of the Violin Concerto) was really touching.   <br /> <br />This is an excellent CD.  Yakov Kreizberg did an outstanding job as both conductor of the Russian National Orchestra and piano accompanist.   <br /> <br />If you enjoy the music of Tchaikovsky, this CD is a must for your music library.   <br />
B000KGGLCU|5.0|For anyone who has enjoyed the music of Madonna The Confessions Tour Live from London shouldn't be excluded. The two disc set contains a DVD and a CD for everyone's viewing and listening pleasure. Disc one the CD contains a sort of songs from Disc two of the concert. Many favorable songs from the concert include: \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Let it Will Be\\", \\"Erotica\\", and \\"Hung Up\\" all live. <br /> <br />If you just listen to the music and decide you like it, than this Collection is good enough. Just listening to the music without any perceptions about it. Don't expect the collection to be anything other than what it is.  <br /> <br />Finally a side note that I have noticed about Madonna's other Albums connection to her Confessions Tour. Some of the lyrics in \\"Hung Up\\" are also in Madonna's Like A prayer Album \\"Love Song\\". Many of the songs seem to build from other albums and are an interesting new way of continuing her themes.  <br /> <br />

NEIL AND GEDDY ARE THEIR USUAL TOP NOTCH SELVES AND NEIL'S LYRICS MAY BE HIS MOST PERSONAL YET ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE SO MANY OF US STRUGGLE WITH FAITH.

B000FZETIO|3.0|I don't know, maybe I'm in the minority here, but after seeing this film--after having not seeing it in like FOREVER, I'm still at the conclusion that the Molly Ringwald character--'Andie' should've wound up with the Jon Cryer 'Duckie' character--and not that the two of them would've turned all madly in love with each other--because it was clear throughout the film that the Andie character just didn't have those kind of feelings for her friend 'Duckie'. <br /> <br />I just think it would've been cool if the Andie character could've showed some kind of solidarity and YES loyalty to Duckie--the ONE (if not) ONLY friend that she had at her school and stayed with HIM at the prom--I mean, let's face it, she was Blane's for the taking and then suddenly he didn't want her anymore, but then to sorta wrap things up, he develops some kind of conscience or thick skin or whatever and decides he wants her back and like clockwork, the Andie character is all eager to take him back? I mean, what about Duckie?  What about his feelings?  Don't worry Duckie, I'm with you all the way--the Andie character missed out on the only good thing she had!  (Jon Cryer, where ever you are, YOU ROCK!!!) <br /> <br />Also, there's great acting from James Spader being his Spader best!
B00005JPFF|5.0|\\"Spider-Man 3\\" is great! The original cast from the first two are back for the second sequel. Also, some of the original crew from the first two are back for the second sequel, as well. Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker / Spider-Man), Kirsten Dunst (as Mary-Jane Watson), and James Franco (as Harry Osborn / The New Goblin) are back and lead an incredible cast that includes Thomas Haden Church (as Flint Marko / Sandman), Topher Grace (as Eddie Brock / Venom), and Bryce Dallas Howard (as Gwen Stacy). The directing by Sam Raimi (who also directed the first two \\"Spider-Man\\" movies) is great. The screen story by Raimi and his brother Ivan & the screenplay by Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Alvin Sargent (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"Spider-Man 2\\" (2004) is great. The music by Christopher Young (who also did the music to a movie that was released as counter-programming to \\"Spider-Man 3\\" (2007), that movie is \\"Lucky You\\" (2007), which was directed by Tobey Maguire's \\"Wonder Boys\\" (2000) director Curtis Hanson) is great. The cinematography by Bill Pope (who also did the cinematography to \\"Spider-Man 2\\") is great. The film editing by Bob Murawski (who also film edited both \\"Spider-Man\\" movies) is great. The casting by Kathy Driscoll & Francine Maisler (who also did the casting to \\"Spider-Man\\" (2002) is great. The production design by J. Michael Riva & Neil Spisak (who also did the production design to both \\"Spider-Man\\" movies) is great. The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr, David F. Klassen, David Swayze, & Dawn Swiderski is great. The set decoration by Leslie A. Pope is great. The costume design by James Acheson (who also did the costume design to both \\"Spider-Man\\" movies) is great. The visual effects by Scott Stokdyk (who was also an visual effects supervisor to the last two \\"Spider-Man\\" movies) are impressive and should get an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. This is a great movie that ranks in between \\"Spider-Man 2\\" & \\"Spider-Man\\". This is thrilling, impressive, and smart.
B00008RH3L|1.0|The kind of movie where the relevence of one scene to the next and even one line of dialogue to the next is often unclear. I don't understand how they can get made.

1582701709|1.0|I understand the need for & significance of self-empowerment.   <br /> <br />Understanding \\"The Secret\\" is not how one authentically empowers herself.  This book is based on the following assumptions: <br />1) That all people should have everything they want. <br />2) That having everything you want will bring one joy or happiness. <br />3) That the purpose of life is to have everything you want. <br /> <br />I find these assumptions seriously flawed.  I will, however, note that there are principles or \\"Truths\\" contained in this book that are liberating such as the notion that ideas create reality and that change occurs through the renewing of one's mind.  These truths, however, are applied in such a way as to enable individuals to think they are their own \\"God\\"- having ultimate control over everything that happens to them.   <br /> <br />Invoking principles of truth to gain autonomy outside of God is an unfulfilling, if not dangerous, thought/act.  Exploring the purpose of life-- not how to get everything you want-- is a much more meaningful  endeavor.   <br /> <br />Are there no critical thinkers left? <br /> <br /> <br />

0790729342|4.0|This is a great addition to the first in the saga of the Mad Max movies.  This film is a non stop roller coaster trill ride with great stunts and vehicles, as well as good characters and acting over all.  A definite must own for a fan of this series.
0789208547|3.0|<br /> <br /> <br />Wonderful. Even my grandkids enjoy this book. The covers were done long before even their parents were born, but the appeal is universal. It's fun when the grandkids ask questions and notice the little social intricacies which made Nornam Rockwell so loved by so many.
B000ICM5W6|4.0|The hulk is a good movie.  Just like the comic books and the tv series.  A brooding David Banner and an enraged green HULK!  The story and the effects are top notch.  I can't wait for the sequel.  Hopefully they don't junk it up because the first Hulk wasn't \\"kid friendly\\".

1582701709|4.0|I know \\"The Secret\\" has generated controversy and a great deal of emotion. I don't want to get into my own philosophy very much for this review. Instead, this is a summary of what you get when you buy this book.<br /><br />First, I should explain that I bought this book to see what everyone is talking about. It turns out, the book is based on the movie. So, the movie is the original \\"The Secret\\" that got everyone talking, not this book. And after reading the book, I believe that the book may be designed more as a supplement to the movie, and less as a stand alone book. So, consider watching the movie before purchasing the book.<br /><br />However, the book does explain what everyone is talking about fairly well.<br /><br />The basic premise of \\"The Secret\\" is that your thoughts create an energy which results in magnetism that goes out into the universe. The author, Rhonda Byrne, feels that you attract various life happenings based on the nature of your thought, whether positive and negative. She covers attracting: money, relationships, and health. She believes attraction works in specifics. In other words, if you want a fancy new car, you must visualize owning a fancy new car.<br /><br />She also has sections on the secret to: the world, you and life. These three cover ways that you can effect more general happenings through your own thoughts.<br /><br />The book consists mostly of many short quotes by living teachers of \\"The Secret.\\" I had heard of a few of the teachers- and not heard of others. However, they represent a spectrum of professions from scientists to new age teachers.<br /><br />Other quotes are by people who are no longer living and obviously did not agree to be part of this project. I must say I was slightly distracted wondering if these great people, for example Albert Einstein, would agree with their words being used in this context, or with the philosophy of the secret in general.<br /><br />Between the quotes are summaries and interpretive comments by Rhonda Byrne.<br /><br />In most cases, she explains how the quote relates to the philosophy. Although I can see how this structure works well in film, in a book it made reading feel slightly disjointed.<br /><br />In summary, I would recommend this book to those who find appeal in the idea of your own thoughts being the cause of events in your life. If this idea already resonates with you, this book will support your beliefs. If you are mostly curious about \\"The Secret\\" and aren't sure you will actually buy into the philosophy, consider watching original \\"The Secret,\\" the movie.terpretive comments by Rhonda Byrne.  <br />In most cases, she explains how the quote relates to the philosophy.

B00009V7P8|5.0|One of the best albums ever! My favorite song keeps changing from time to time and mood. \\"Older Chests\\", \\"Eskimo\\", \\"Blower's Daughter\\", ... all of them are fantastic compositions with great lyrics, music and vocals ... a truly stunning album!
1582701709|4.0|I had never been into `self help' or `new age' books (I know it's horrible to stick labels so broadly, but that's how I used to think). I really got introduced to the genre by my wife, who is an avid reader of such books, and when I got my hands on The Secret, I gave it a go. <br /> <br />I think this book has attracted its fair share of rave reviews and scathing criticism- I guess the best way to look at this book is a balanced perspective. First of all, there are many, many things that could be a real source of inspiration on a day to day basis- the simple fact that thinking positively helps, or visualizing the desired outcomes helps us focus our energies on it- thereby creating a positive spiral. Yes, a lot of these are not rocket science, and we may have heard variations along the way, but the truth is also that it is so easy to lapse into negativity in the course of the pressures of our day to day lives, that we often forget these. The Secret acts as a great reminder of the power of positivity. <br /> <br />Having said that (and here's the piece on balance)- at the end of the day, what you get out of any book is ultimately up to you- so don't expect this book alone to change your life. You need to really believe in the principles and then be willing to act on them on a day to day basis. <br /> <br />So why only 4 stars? To be honest, the only gripe I have with a lot of such books is that they focus so much on material progress (how much money, how many cars, how big a house). Nothing wrong with that- since that's what many people want, and presumably why such books zoom to the top of the bestsellers- but I only wish more books would celebrate the power of being happy about day to day, little things. Not all of us will ever become millionnaires, but all of us have people or things that we can feel happy about everyday- and that may be an even bigger secret to happiness. <br /> <br />- Mainak Dhar, author, [[ASIN:0470822295 Brand Management 101: 101 Lessons fromReal-World Marketing]]
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Excellent entertainment. Rivals Sean Connery at his best. Looking forward <br />to seeing more of Daniel Craig.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I'm a big Rocky fan and it is an excellent film about life.  I often reflect back to the \\"Rocky Balaboa\\" film when the challenges of life come.  Some of the sayings from the film pick me up when I'm feeling down.  This is a must-own.  Stallone's commentary on the film is like a healing balm.  The bonus features were quite entertaining, as well.  It's not over, til it's over!
B000GRUS22|5.0|There hasn't been one song since Enigma starting putting out music that I don't like. This is another great masterpiece!
B000N0W9WO|5.0|This movie is so good and it looks great on blu-ray!  Seriously a chick flick! Cameron Diaz is one of my favorite actresses and she really cracked me up in this movie.  I am not usually a big fan of Jude Law, but he was sooooooooo sweet in this movie.  A feel good movie!
1596680199|5.0|What else can I say - everyone has said it all.  I wish Carol had written this book before I purchased the other 50 or so I have!!!. <br /> <br />BRAVO - WELL DONE - WONDERFUL COMPILATION - JOLLY GOOD!!!!!

B000MXPE74|4.0|Costello Music is a delightful, foot-stomping romp. It is like a Saturday night full of illicit substances and bar-hopping in Edinburg. It's loud, it's crass and it's got more sing-alongs than a Disney movie. Costello Music is pure fun. Excessive listening leaves one feeling kind of hung-over, but the album is a diverting ride while it lasts.

032147404X|3.0|This is a good book for someone starting out in Photography and desiring some simple means to increase the quality of their images.  However, there are technical errors in the book in which the set up described does not work with the camera shown.  Don't know if the author was thinking about a different camera but a few of the tricks with the D-70 shown in the picture are not possible.  If you already have an understanding of basic photography and the use of digital equipment I would recommend you seek out a book that will elevate you skills more. I am a photographer and camera equipment specialist, bought this book to review and see if worth purchasing for new folks at entry level with our business.  I have decided no, if you have any photography training or basic skills get something more advanced.

1582701709|5.0|I have seen many reviews that panned this book, but I loved reading it.  Sure, the premise is something we all know, positive thinking brings positive things into your life, but how many times do we forget that??   <br /> <br />I thought that this brought forward many different view of that premise, and how to implement this in your life, and knowing that each person quoted in this book, was quoted saying basically the same thing with NO knowledge of what others were saying should tell us something very important.  That important thing is this:  Postive thinking, attitude and expectation WILL affect your life in a positive way.  How you choose to use that is up to you - physically, mentally, spiritually, whatever.   <br />I think we sometimes forget that very important distinction, we CAN use this, it DOES work, and we DO sometimes forget that!

B000MQC9H4|3.0|Sappy romantic story without the bite or the humor of \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". 3 star female rating, 1 star male rating.
1933784105|5.0|Like the models depicted in the book itself, the painstaking attention to detail is amazing. As a long time fan of Star Wars and collector of memoribilia from the saga, the Lorne Peterson signed limited edition version is a must have for any fan. Aside from the hardcover book, which is very well presented and detailed, comes a plethora of other unique, such as the case itself, moulded and hand painted pieces from the original scaled model of the Millennium Falcon and Death Star. Then there's the copy of Lorne's original scaled Lanspeeder with Luke, Ben, R2 and 3PO. I thought 'Dressing a Galaxy' was fantastic, well this is even better.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|After recently seeing the stage show version, I bought the DVD ...and I liked it better than the stage show.  It was easier to understand.
B00000IBDY|3.0|The packaging is rather dull compared to the Zombies re-issues as far as information and pictures are concerned but the recordings have been digitally remastered and they sound awesome. The only complaint that I have is the fact that the original Single Mono Mix of \\"My White Bicycle\\" was not included!!! I don't understand how the record company could have ommitted this version of the song. The \\"fake\\" stereo version that is used on this cd release is the same one used on the original release but it's pretty bad and difficult to listen to with headphones. It sounds like you've stuffed your left ear with a cotton ball, it really does! Stand out tracks for me personally are: \\"My White Bicycle\\", \\"Colonel Brown\\", \\"Real Life Permanent Dream\\" awesome song!, and the cover of \\"Strawberry Fields\\" is actually quite good! The bonus tracks are also pretty good, but no biggie. My actual rating would be a 3.5. There are at least 4 good tracks and that's a lot by today's standards!!!
B000065VB0|4.0|Other than stating the obvious that this is a masterpiece, a landmark, Gabriel at his solo best, the only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars (what it truely deserves) is even though the recording is clear with excellent soundstaging, its lacking in base extension. One might disagree and say that there is a lot of base and yes there is, but it's all in the upper base. There is none in the lower registers. This takes away some of the power and authority that this music demands. But taken into perspective of the greatness of this music, it's a minor nit pic.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|it is sad this is the last 1 i will miss them my girls and i love this show we get junck food out when it is on our dog loves the theme song he runs around when he hears it
B00007KWHN|5.0|What makes this a truely great and timeless album is that not only is the music superb but the recording is equally superb. This is the downfall of most recording of this genre. Many albums, where even though I love the music, I find them hard (and painful) to listen because of the muddy nature of the sound and the lack of base dynamics - so I end up not listening to them. Not so with The Yes Album, it stands up to todays recordings. The only other one of their's that comes close is Fragile. Relayer, which I consider their creative best, is lacking in soundstaging and base punch. (On the remastered release there is a demo version of Gates of Delerium that is beautifully crystal clear with lots of dynamic punch. It painfully demonstrates what the final recording is lacking)
B000001ZSE|4.0|This music works well for specific workouts. That was the intent for the puchase.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|We heard the Piano Concerto No. 5 in F on National Public Radio and decided that we must have this piece of music in our CD collection. We selected this CD since the two CDs allowed us to purchase all 5 of Camille Saint-Saens' Piano Concertos. This CD has become one of our favorites and we play it often, discovering more interest in the work of Saint-Saens with each playing.  <br /> <br />Camille Saint-Saens' sense of drama, his lyric runs, his ability to evoke mystery, all make this listening experience highly recommended. I am fascinated by the way Saint-Saens creates rich variations of his themes as he takes us from movement to movement. Saint-Saens has the ability to develop ethereal melodies and variations on themes that are hypnotic and mystical. His piano runs are pushed for dramatic effect. The creative and amusing variations of his themes are pleasant and amusing. <br /> <br />This CD is highly recommended. In addition to the 5 Piano Concertos, Saint-Saens' Wedding Cake Caprice and the Africa Fantaisie are included. I found Jean-Phillippe Collard's interpretation to be masterful and rich, capturing the vast complexity and variation that Saint-Saens created in his compositions.
0823003590|4.0|There is a reason why this book is requested in the finest Ateliers in the world: it's the real knowledge of what you are seeking as an artist.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I had heard Rush and their producer, Nick Raskulinecz (\\"Boujze\\" from now on, his real name is too hard to type.) saying things like how it's \\"the album of their career\\" or \\"their best work in 20 years\\". Of course, artists always rave about their new albums to promote sales... But I think it really is both of those things. It's a big change from the loud, fast, crazy Vapor Trails. It's a little more relaxed, with less overdubs, more solos, and my oh my, a little keyboards! I think it's far easier to listen to this one all the way through than Vapor Trails. In fact, I like the music on on S&A far more than Vapor Trails (well, except Secret Touch. That one could fit on this album quite well.).  <br /> <br />The three instrumentals are all great! They're fresh and energetic, definitely not forced. (I thought Where's My Thing was a little bit forced. Not bad, but not as organic as YYZ or LVS.) Though the tracks stand out well by themselves, I just have a hard time shutting this album off and walking away. There's soooooooo much good material on here. The only song I don't quite understand yet (remember: it was just released 5 days ago!) is Good News First. It's not clicking yet. I like it, but I don't get that \\"Oh hells yeah!\\" feeling that I get from all the other ones. That's why I'm not doing the song by song review yet. I think it still needs time to grow on me further. Maybe it'll get old and I'll have to reduce the rating to 3 stars. But I really hope not.  <br /> <br />At this point, it's my favorite Rush album ever.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable concert DVDs I have ever seen.  Every song is wonderful with such talented singers and players.  If you like a beautiful setting, great camera work and suburb singers and players, this DVD is for you!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is an Amazing DVD showing a performan by talented vocalists and musicians.  The quality is absolutely amazing, and the songs are so beautiful that they'll simply envelop you in their stories.  overall very good clasical music.

1401302378|2.0|Too much general ideas and too little innovative informations: <br />I would hope finding a more stimulant approaches to the future of Business and about our role in a such globalize economic word.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I received the DVD promptly. It was in great shape. I would order from this vendor again.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The greatest collection of the Greatest movie ever made.  Excellent extra's.  Never a better 2 movies ever made (number 3 not so good).
0140067477|5.0|I recently finished reading this book (and have now moved on to \\"The Te of Piglet\\") and absolutely enjoyed every line of it!  I am a huge fan of the Winnie the Pooh books and also of trying to look at life from different angles, this book blended these two things perfectly!
B00023B1LC|5.0|I love the Bourne Movies and Matt Damon what can I say?  Can't wait for the third.  Movies arrived on time.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
B000NA28HU|5.0|I read the book and I was not disappointed with the movie.  The movie followed the book very closely,except for the time Saphira was growing to adulthood. My husband had not read the book but did enjoy the movie and we both look forward to a sequel.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|John from Cleveland has placed the best review I have seen on this site, so I will just add my own opinion. This is without a doubt the best cd of 2006, and will stand the test of time.I find myself listening to it at least once a month. Considering that I own at least 1,000 cds, that is saying something. My favorite track is \\"Nettie Moore\\" but I consider the whole album brilliant. It is some of the finest roots music I have heard in a long time.
B000B5H6WY|2.0|This was not my type of book.  After reading \\"An Unquiet Mind\\" and \\"Girl Interrupted\\" , I should have realized this is not a book that was going to keep my interest.  The writing is very choppy.  The time and place changes through out the book and it is difficult to follow at times.  I do think the story of Sylvia Plath is very interesting.  And sad.  I would probably be more interested in reading a book about her written by someone else.
0375805613|4.0|At first when I began reading this book to my daughter at 6 months, she was not very interested. Now that she is a little older she really likes the story.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|This was the only S.T. movie I had not seen.  Sure glad to have found it and enjoyed it!
0399230033|4.0|My daughter is 8 months old and, although there are not many words in this book, she loves the pictures and bright colors.
B00005JPGO|4.0|I don't want to review this movie much since it is already covered by many folks. It is a good movie to watch. I just want to focus on similar subject about blood money. Tantalum is the material used in high tech industry primarily cell phones. Due to global demand of cell phones, companies have explored Congo. Did this blood money help to fuel a bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo? Darfur crisis (Sudan-China oil/gas and arms trade connection) - Is money received from China is prolonging Darfur crisis? . These topics also need to be researched. Also, do watch how arms industry participate in supplying arms in special features (second disk) in Lord of War (Nicolas Cage).
B000MNP2K8|4.0|I am still a Sean Connery fan as James Bond, but Daniel Craig put a new spin on Bond, and I really enjoyed the movie.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I received this cd quickly, well before the estimated arrival date. Thanks for the great service.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE IT HAS LOTS OF ACTION AND KEEPS YOU THERE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT DURING THE ENTIRE MOVIE. THIS IS ONE YOU CANT GET UP AND LEAVE DURING THE MOVIE OR YOU WILL MISS SOME EXCELLENT ACTION SCENES . HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! FIVE STARS FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|A lot of my friends did not care for this movie, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it was nice to get to a realistic Bond movie. It is like watching a different thread of Bourne Identity. I really liked the change in Bond. Comedic in a sense, but all business.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Great music from groundbreaking movies, arranged for solo cello and orchestra.  Selections are arranged roughly into suites by the director of each film (e.g. the Sergio Leone Suite, the Brian de Palma Suite, etc.)  Ennio Morricone's work (recently celebrated with a Screen Actor's Guild Lifetime Achievement Award) more than sets the tone for each movie, it becomes a character in each movie -- when you hear a certain theme played, you are instantly transported back to that moment when you first heard it.  A definite must have for film buffs, soundtrack enthusiasts and fans of Morricone or Ma.
B00000I8UF|5.0|This is an absolutely stunning set.<br /><br />One of those moments when a group of musicians takes the music to an unrealised place.<br /><br />Pure passion and soul.<br /><br />The recording was one of masterful precision.<br /><br />A jazz classic in the highest regard.
1582701709|4.0|Rhonda Byrne has written a great introductory book (the DVD enlarges the vision of the book)for those of us continually looking for self-help material. It has the potential to be life changing because of the information that is in it as well as the information that it alludes to throughout the text.  It can be a quick read and a quick reference of pithy sayings to help one with postitive thinking. I found the most value, however, in the contacts she gave in the book. The book does not do a complete job in explaining the Law of Attraction, and one could get frustrated with seemlingly no results in the process as it is explained in this book. It is defintely worth the money and excellent background for a study of the law of attraction and metaphysics.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a great movie.I watch it with my granddaughter and she is always mesmerized.She never gets tired of watching it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I found this movie to be light-hearted, entertaining and genuinely funny.  Kate Winslet is fabulous and her character resonates with anyone who has ever loved someone who did not love them back - just used them!  Cameron Diaz pulls off the comedy beautifully.  Jack Black and Jude Law were awesome.  I actually bought two copies so I will always have it in my library.  One of my favorites!
B000MXPE7O|4.0|I'm curious: yesterday I wrote and submitted a fairly long review --- which reflected, in my view, a lot of thought about The Good Shepherd --- and then, when finished, clicked the \\"submit\\" or \\"post\\" button, and shut down my pc.  Today, expecting to find the review on your web site, I notice that the review hasn't been posted.    [...].        Thank you, Michael Gordon
1582701709|3.0|This is a interesting book.  There really is no \\"Secret\\".  What it all comes down to is \\"Faith\\"..Jesus said, \\" that whatever you ask for, Believing in you heart, is yours\\"  Not in those exact words.  \\"The Secret\\" seems so mystical & awesome, but it  is not....just  deep rooted Faith .
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil is in great voice here, and playing solo acoustic versions of lots of songs that eventually wound up on Harvest, plus earlier stuff.  Played with passion, this is good stuff.  The DVD leaves much to be desired.  Terrible picture quality.
0316779237|3.0|I enjoyed the opportunity to read David Sedaris' stories, some of which I had read elsewhere. It is a good format to launch someone on 'the good ship Sedaris' but for those who have been initiated, it was all too brief in the newness arena. It rattles along very comfortably, like an old Chevrolet, but we do like the smell of a new car every so often, don't we?
B000002J5K|5.0|I am still a fan of this movie but the music is AWESOME! John and Dan did a splendid rendition of \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" that stands out of one of the best selections in this collection! The late James Brown adds an awesome power in The Old Landmark that should make your hands clap!Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin were first rate with their selections. We can't forget the musical legend Cab Calloway with Minnie the Moocher! Great Movie...Great C.D.! This rocks!!
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is some sort of nut, like Shakespeare was in his time. To grab the attention of a reader the way David Sedaris does in his writing is a particular skill enjoyed by very few writers. \\" Is thems the thoughts of cows ?\\" , has gone into google-speak as a stand-alone expression worthy of such an accolade. I would never say that I could identify with his life experiences or his family but after riding along on his journey with him, I do feel that have stayed the weekend in his mind. I've enjoyed the visit but I feel fortunate to be able to check out afterwards. I've laughed, smiled and shaken my head at his writing and can't wait to go back for more.
B00000F14B|5.0|This is a movie I am proud to own in my collection. I may be biased but it has a lot to do with the state that I live in and the person who wrote it. Meredith Wilson composed this classic based on his experiences growing up in Mason City, a community some 65 miles to the northeast where I live. This year marks 50 years when this musical came to the Broadway stage and 45 years when the movie first opened up. To this day, \\"76 Trombones\\",\\"You Got Trouble\\", \\"Til There Was You\\", \\"Marian the Librarian\\" and the other tunes still stand out as the best around! Whenever I need a pick me up, I turn The Music Man on my DVD player! Loved every minute of it!!
B000KC8O3S|4.0|This cd is loaded with all the music from the new Doctor Who episodes. My favorite music is when the Doctor and Rose have been separated.  The music is haunting and beautiful truly capturing the meaning of their separation.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|The movie itself, is hilarious and entertaining.  Watching it in BLU-RAY just brings it up another level!  The picture clarity is so amazing is almost distracts from the movie.  Highly recommend the movie and watching it in BLU RAY format!!!
1582701709|5.0|If you are serious about creating a path for you life and are willing to let go of blaming others for the imperfections you currently face, this is the book for you! I listen to this on CD regularly and I have to say... my life was not bad before but it has wonderfully transformed into exactly what I desire. I no longer sit on the sidelines and think to myself, my life is okay, this is the best I can do. No sir!! I am responsible for my thoughts and I use them more deliberately now. I give the credit to God for blessing us with the gifts we have inside and a mind willing to allow good in. <br /> <br />Many say The Secret is not a new concept. Regardless, this concept is needed at this time in this world. Lets change our world into a peaceful, happier, and more abundant place to live, one life at a time. Do your part and watch it spread.

B000021XS0|5.0|Metropolis Part 2 is the end result of having a joke called \\"Metropolis Part I\\" go too far, far enough to get the best of Dream Theater and push them to make an album for its second part.  The end result is one of the best works Dream Theater has delivered to date.<br /><br />The song of Metropolis has been cut to pieces, separated from each other, inserted as individual partitions to different songs atop which Dream Theater added new material inspired by and inspiring them.  That 12-minute song blasted into an epic classic.  The album contains two ballads (Through Her Eyes, The Spirit Carries On), one instrumental song (The Dance of Eternity), and many other things mixed in with good prog metal.  Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci and Johny Myung deliver in fine fashion; this one contains an emphasized diversity on their part.  James LaBrie also delivers one of his best performances.  Everything is right where they should be, there are no loose ends (if there are, they are loose in a very prog metal way).<br /><br />Lyrically, the complex story is enticing due to the intense writing; you think you got it at first listen, but if you re-read them, you get more and more each time.  If anything, the first few times it makes perfect sense, but then it starts to make more sense as you go along.<br /><br />The flow, I have to add, is perfect.  Normally, you get one or two songs out of place or not as perfect.  But not this one.  Once you start, I recommend you not stop (not that you'd want to) to feel it, for the album takes you in and never lets go if its possible.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to those that are going to start listening to Dream Theater, or prog fans that haven't listened to DT yet, or any rock/metal fan who is with an open mind and wants to explore.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|S&A is a work of art, perfect song after perfect song. It's quite simply the best Rush record ever and probably one of my favorite records of all time. \\"Far Cry\\" was just the tip of the iceberg. And next month is the tour. Life is good.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|More listening pleasure from the talented Loreena McKennitt!  The long-awaited \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is nearly as delightful as \\"The Mask and Mirror\\" and \\"The Book of Secrets\\". We were fortunate to see McKennitt at the majestic Wang Theater in Boston and the sets, musicians and performance was fantastic! The influence of her Celtic interests and Morrocan and Spanish travels come through again in this her most recent CD.  Each time I listen to it, I like it more!
0807126063|5.0|It takes a genius to write a character like Ignatius J. Reilly THIS well! This is such a brilliantly funny book, I could not put it down when I first read it at the age of 16, and each subsequent time. I've read it in 2 languages and in both cases I couldn't tear myself away! It's hilarious on many different levels! It's psychological comedy! I lent it to a friend who is a clinical Psychologist, and then to my mother, neither one could put it down either!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is the best one yet. Very uplifting. Will be looking forward to the next one.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Having small hands and rather weak wrists, using an ordinary garlic press was often a painful experience. After reading several reviews of the Rosle press, I decided it would be worth experimenting with. I find that it really does require less strength. There's a feeling of having more leverage. Inserting a clove initially seemed more awkward than with a typical press because there are more moving parts, and they need to be held in the right position. Cleaning is easier (as advertised), because the holes are a bit larger than with a standard press and don't seem to get clogged. It's pricey for a garlic press, but worth it to avoid wrist injury.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The magic of this movie is its blend of the fantasy and that of the Stage Magician.  I choose my movies not by the stars, at least usually, but by what they seem to be, good movies.  So I will jump genras and that makes it hard to find a specific line for me to follow.  I had seen \\"The Illusionist\\" and thought perhaps this was like that movie.  Though not entirely disappointed it was still a wonderful fantasy drama.  The Stage Magicians world is one of illusions and sometimes you really wonder 'how did he do that', which is what the Magician wants you to wonder.  Wonderment is his stock and trade.  \\"The Prestige\\" was such an act but unlike \\"The Illusionist\\" it took a fantasy turn at the end, like something out of H. G. Wells, where fantastic things happen out of science but they have unexpected results.  Though I liked this movie, I was hoping that it was something like the other.  I did enjoy the mystery of the plot. <br />I thought the acting was believable.  Bale and Jakeman were very good as the rivals, both bent on ruining each other for the purpose of vengence but the fantasy ending was unexpected.  But then that was true until I remembered that the time setting, and therefore was in perfect harmony of the turn of the century of 1900 era, when technology, as represented by Tesla was new and very mysterious.
B000002KDG|5.0|If you are a Neil Young fan, this is a must for your collection.  Every song is great!
B000NA28IE|5.0|I am a fantasy fan but only of good fantasy.  I am basically a historian so a novel usually needs to invoke a sense of history behind it.  Likewise with movies.  This is one.  Now I know that there has been criticism of the book that it is like Star Wars and LOTR together but there is a quality that is unique in it that is as ancient as the mythology of the world, the quest of the the young boy to find his manhood.  This is a hero genra movie (as the book is too) and is an important addition to my collection of quality fantasy fiction that deals with Hero Quests.  It resonates in my consciousness that way.
B00008O31H|5.0|This is a super offering by the Black Keys.  I like their latest, \\"Magic Potion\\" a little better, but both are so good that you should own them if you are a fan of blues guitar.
B000MRA5EM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this IMAX production.  I learned about the different forms of sealife and how their survival depends on each other.  It also sheds life on how humans are destroying this marine life by continuing to fish for these exotic fish.  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a wonerful job on the narration.  It is almost like they are just having a conversation between themselves.  It was very informative and entertaining.
B000MVN8HE|5.0|Don't believe the cheesy promo and other ads for this show, Veronica Mars isn't your typical teen drama, in fact it is nothing like your typical teen drama with plenty of action, suspense, humor, and yes, some romance for all the ladies out there.  Plus unlike other teen drama that just pluck actor from an Abercrombie catalogue, this show has actors that can actually act so you won't start laughing whenever one of them tries to emote like on other shows.  So give Veronica Mars a try, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B00006YXE4|5.0|What a wonderful concert. The CD's and DVD are awesome. <br />Great price, too!
B000NA1OXY|2.0|From her first album to her second, there seemed to be growth to Avril Lavigne as she moved from the power pop to a more rock sound. After the second album the maturity seemed to grow as she got married and released the Celine Dion type power balled from a movie that no one saw. Then the Girlfriend video came out and everyone saw that Avril had traded in her neckties for high heels, hot pants, and pink streaks in her hair. It's almost as see saw Britney shave her hair and thought that if anyone could fill the void of blonde pop princess with a trashy husband, why not her? <br /> <br />With the image makeover, the songs on The Best Damn Thing aren't musically that far from those that made up her debut. But that makes it a step backwards; sure the songs here are catchy like Complicated, but they are most disposable of disposable pop whereas songs like My Happy Ending have a mush longer staying power. Everything Back but You is just a rehash of Sk8ter Boi, though it does have the best line on the disk, \\"I wish you were her, you left out the `e'.\\" Classic. When she slow things down things only gets worse. Keep Holding On is stuck on the end, and songs like When You're Gone just bogs down the album. <br /> <br />One of the reasons why When You're Gone loses its weight is because you can't help listening to it and thinking it is about her husband. Seriously, do we really need sappy loves dongs about the dude from Sum41? Even more embarrassing for Whibley than the love song written about him is I Don't Have to Try where Avril starts of the song in another faux rap like the breakdown from Girlfriend, I'm the one, the one that wears the pants.\\" But then again, how can you embarrass a guy who is a notch in Paris Hilton's bedpost. <br /> <br />Hopefully by the next album, Avril will have stopped taking her giddy pills that she took in the making of this album because smiling and happy Avril. As catchy as some of the songs are, they will be forgotten by the time the next powerpop girl releases her album of forgettable middle school anthems. And since they seem like they come out once a month, that won't be too long.

B000NQR7NO|4.0|Nobody in recent years had a bigger buzz leading up to the release of their album than Arctic Monkeys. Then the album was released and they were met with general indifference. Yeah, not even the Beatles could have lived up to that kind of hype, but Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not was a good album (that landed at number 14 on my 50 Best Albums of 2006). Who know why the band was ignored, my guess is that, even though most people lose their accents when singing, Alex Turner's vocals still sounds very British. <br /> <br />And if the British thing is what kept Americans from jumping on the bandwagon for the first album, it's doubtful the second will change their mind, right down to the extra British \\"U\\" in the album's title, Favourite Worst Nightmare. The disk may even be less palatable to the general audience here as the disk is distinctly harder and faster as evident with the album opener first single, Brianstorm, a jarring sound of guitars that will command your attention right from the start. <br /> <br />But much like on the last album, the band is at its best when it goes into the mid-tempo area with quirky lyrics that cleverly rhyme and nowhere on Favourite Worst Nightmare is that displayed than of Florescent Adolescent a song about a girl gone wild who is wild no more as she, \\"used to get it in your fishnets now you only get it in your nightdress.\\" With two good albums in as many years, the Arctic Monkeys may be providing those who like real music for years to come, long after the current crop of dudes wearing eyeliner are resigned to VH1 reality shows.
1582701709|5.0|I suggest this product for everyone.  Even if you don't follow it completely,  it gives alot of food for thought and a great way to better yourself and your way of thinking in a very positive way.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|An enjoyable movie whose climax fell short.  Stories are about choices.  Will Ferrell's character ultimately has no power or choice in resolving the conflict that he is thrust into by the omnipotent narrator/novelist who controls his life.  By the end, I was wondering, if Harold Crick cannot change his life unless the narrator lets him, why should I care about him?  In that sense, even though the movie is about Harold Crick, the story is ultimately about the novelist, Kay Eiffel, since she is the only one who has the power to act and change anything in the story.      In spite of this weakness, I found the subdued comic portrayals by Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Hoffman to be outstanding and the first 3/4 of the movie showing Mr. Ferrel's character expanding the bounds of his claustrophobic life to be very touching.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|\\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is by far the finest collection of music Rush has released in well over twenty years.  I can't say Rush has ever released a truly awful album, but they have swam in the waters of mediocrity on more than one occasion.  Rush has always displayed outstanding musicianship on all their albums however sometimes the songwriting has been lacking to say the least.  I'm happy to say that this release showcases some of the finest lyrics Neil Peart has written since the eighties.    The album opens up with the energetic  single \\"Far Cry\\" which is the best album opener since \\"Dreamline\\" from 1991's Roll The Bones.   The song has an energy level similar to that found in \\"One Little Victory\\" however the improvement is that it has a great melody and one of the best choruses from a Rush song in years.    Many of the best tracks here touch on religious fanaticism.  \\"Armor and Sword\\", \\"Workin' Them Angels\\", \\"Faithless\\" and \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" tackle the religious fundamentalist without being blatant or in-your-face.  \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" in particular is subtle swipe at the current administration and \\"Faithless\\" has the message that being a believer does not make you a good person and being an unbeliever does not make you a bad person.    Some of the other tracks on this release are about strained relationships.  \\"Spindrift\\" uses the weather on the sea as a metaphor for a relationship gone awry.      This is the first Rush studio release to feature multiple instrumentals.  \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is an instrumental that fits up with the likes of \\"YYZ\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\".  \\"Hope\\" is a fine solo by Alex Lifeson and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" is a short but sweet jam session.     At this point in their career it becomes more and more likely that the latest Rush release may be their last.  If \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is to be their last (and I hope it isn't) it will be comforting to know they band went out on a high note.

B000O174CM|5.0|<br />As a drama major in college, I bemoan the fact that roadshow versions of Broadway musicals are too damned expensive nowadays, especially when souvenir booklets and sweatshirts are factored in.  So I am grateful when an Oscar-winning writer/director like Bill Condon (GODS AND MONSTERS, CHICAGO) decides to lavishly film a Tony winner, like 1981's DREAMGIRLS.  It's a fabulous, glittering three-ring circus of a movie, with a strong script, stunning performances by three extraordinary African-American singers (Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as Effie, Beyonce Knowles as Deena, and Anika Noni Rose as Lorrell), and dazzling theatrical lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer (Tobias Schliesser is cinematographer).  It's a gem of a musical that, at a running time of 130 minutes and with twelve almost non-stop songs, has to be pretty close to the stage original.  And if some songs have been shortened, I did not notice. <br /> <br />With lyrics by Tom Eyen, music by Henry Krieger, and choreography inspired by  Michael Bennett, DREAMGIRLS is loosely based on the rise and fall of the Supremes.  Effie, Deena, and Lorrell are here called The Dreams, and Jamie Foxx as Curtis Taylor is their arrogant manager.  He is not afraid to walk all over people in mid-1960's Detroit when the more talented Effie is put in the rear of the trio because Deena is more beautiful.  And Eddie Murphy (deservedly Oscar-nominated as James \\"Thunder\\" Early) never attracts a white crossover audience as a drug-addicted R&B lounge singer; he eventually dies of a heroin overdose.  We follow The Dreams all the way to Los Angeles around 1975 as they try to make it as black singers in mostly white middle America over fifteen years or so.  The finale is a stupendous and dazzling, ten-star, rock-the-house affair that leads in to ten minutes of closing credits to let us know that literally hundreds of talented people on both sides of the camera helped bring this beloved stage musical to the screen as a razzle-dazzle affair. <br /> <br />The version of DREAMGIRLS that I bought is the \\"2-disk Showstopper Edition\\", and they aren't kidding.  Disk one with the movie includes extended versions of all twelve musical numbers, a special cutting room floor Jennifer Hudson number, and a Beyonce music video.  And a mammoth disk 2 includes a full 2 hour documentary on creating both the stage musical and the movie step by step 25 years apart; auditions and screen tests; and individual featurettes on the dazzling lighting, creating the costumes, doing the editing, and many more technical shorts.  It should keep you out of trouble and humming happily for days on end. <br /> <br />For once, new Hollywood has improved on old Hollywood by showing how to transfer an award-winning stage musical to the screen brilliantly and successfully.  DREAMGIRLS is a giddy and exhilarating knockout.  And, yes, it should have been an Oscar nominee for Picture and Director, though it got plenty of other nominations.  Like the brilliant LITTLE CHILDREN, also shut-out for Picture and Director, it will be fun to see what movies from 2006 people are still raving about in ten or twenty years.  By the way, do see DREAMGIRLS in wide-screen format for its Panavision images.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />

B000BSNPR6|2.0|just stick to the their cd's honestly, I was really looking forward to seeing them live on stage, but they whole thing is like a britney spears concert, all were pretending to play their instruments, and that orchestral arrangments that sounds so good on a cd just looked really bad as a background tape in the concert...they should have hired the proper orechestra to be more authentic, true will cost more money..but thats how art and music should be performed... <br />

0393061310|3.0|I'm not sure why but this book was difficult for me to read. Prior to this book I had no background in anthropology. It did change my mind on a few long held mis-notions I had. For me this book provided a good (yet difficult) introduction in breaching the big subject of history of the human race. That is a pretty broad subject, huh? But this book did provide me some background and stimulus in this subject. I found many of Mr. Diamonds theories interesting and sound, but then without much of a background on this subject it comes out as just my opinion. If anything this book is thought provoking.
B000GUJF4G|4.0|A good movie that's it, but incredible sound and video.
0099771810|2.0|It's my impression that the Pulitzer Prize is generally awarded to superior writers for inferior books. Maybe the idea is to encourage newer writers who show promise and belatedly to acknowledge experienced writers in decline or maybe it's strictly a matter of politics, but I've yet to read a Pulitzer-Prize-winning book I thought was up to scratch.     John Updike's second novel, \\"Rabbit Run\\", was possibly his best, certainly his best Rabbit book, and deservedly won a National Book Award, but Updike was awarded Pulitzer Prizes for his anemic \\"Rabbit is Rich\\" and his slightly better \\"Rabbit at Rest\\" instead. Other disappointments include the disjointed \\"Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\\" by Michael Chabon and \\"Ironweed\\" by William Kennedy.    \\"American Pastoral\\" is probably not much worse than \\"Letting Go\\" and the \\"Facts\\", but it's certainly no match for any other of Roth's books from \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" to \\"The Counterlife\\". The thing about it that disturbs me particularly is that if I didn't know his previous work or his biography I'd be willing to bet its author had no first-hand acquaintance with the sixties at all. The tone is completely off.

B000002534|5.0|Santana has released many albums in his long and distinguished career and naturally some get more attention than others. \\"Borboletta\\" came in 1974 and was part of his jazz fusion period but much more uptempo than his previous jazzy outings. A great listen from start to finish with songs like \\"Mirage\\" and \\"One with the Sun\\" standing out. Definitely one of his all time best- he's done other jazzy works but none quite like this. Great album cover too!
B000MZHW4A|5.0|\\"Blood diamond\\" is a multidimensional movie, because it must be seen and scrutinized from different levels.<br /><br />First at all, it's a courageous film, that, following similar traces in  the same pattern of \\"The constant gardener\\" has decided to deal with this delicate and compromising issue about which everybody talks in silent voice. And the smart script involves the lives of four people, united randomly; a mercenary, an inquisitive journalist, a native and finally the big boss who is beyond stage in this dark affair , best known as conflictive diamonds.<br /><br />There's a lot of action, but also many moments to make us to reflect around this theme.<br /><br />Towering acting of all the cast and fluid direction of this talented director.

B000GCFO0S|5.0|I have played the original Silent Hill for the Playstation One, and let me tell you, the main story of this movie is almost exactly the same as the video game! I'm not kidding- I knew exactly what was going to happen because the stories were so much alike that a part of me was actually worried that I might be wasting my time watching the movie when I could be playing the game. <br /> <br />As you've probably heard, the video game Silent Hill was extremely groundbreaking in the year 1999 because the game was SO scary and SO different compared to every other game that was on the market at the time. Now, with that in mind, this movie failed to live up to the intense atmosphere of the video game.  <br /> <br />However, it doesn't matter, because the movie did a respectable job at scaring me, and you know, having the main character be a woman who has to find her daughter instead of a father who has to find his daughter (like the video game) may have actually been a better decision. If you've played the game, you'd know that Harry Mason was a REALLY bad voice actor. The woman who plays the mother in the film is really good.  <br /> <br />Also, considering this movie came out years after the video game it's based on, technology has improved which means you are guaranteed to see better visual effects in the movie than you would in 1999 playing the game. Silent Hill the game was more about remaining quiet and building an atmosphere, whereas the movie has some really unusual effects such as blood rising off the floor and walls and increasing the overall amount of action. <br /> <br />The similarities between the movie and the game don't stop there- remember when you had to run around looking for your daughter in the beginning of the game? It's in the movie. Remember that snowy town with buildings all around it, and only a human police officer around? It's in the movie. Remember finding a note from your daughter that she's at the school? It's in the movie. A lot of things fromthe game are in the movie. <br /> <br />Another complaint people have with this movie is that the story doesn't make sense. That was a popular complaint with the video game too. I don't like it when horror movies make sense, to be honest. I can't feel scared when the story begins making total sense. Silent Hill leaves you wondering what's going on. You'll know what's going on. The movie just takes a weird direction later on that may end up confusing you. <br /> <br />Really good movie worth watching, even if you've played the video game a million times like me.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is another in the list of CD's in my collection that you wouldn't expect a metalhead to have.  I mean, the guy who runs Black Sabbath's website - liking Stevie Wonder?!?  To be honest, before I bought this, when I thought of Stevie Wonder, I thought of three things.  First, he's blind.  Second, Eddie Murphy used to parody him on Saturday Night Live.  Third, his song \\"Superstition\\", which I loved.  That was it.<br /><br />In April 2007, my stepfather died, and due to that, I had to head over to Men's Wearhouse to buy a suit for the funeral.  While I was in there, I was getting fitted, and a song came on.  I thought it was Will Smith's \\"Wild Wild West\\" from the (bad) movie of the same name.  However, as it went along, I realized \\"Hey, that's not Will Smith\\".  Listened some more, and said \\"That sounds like Stevie Wonder\\".  Turns out it was, it was his song \\"I Wish\\".  I was quite amazed.  Not only did Will lift the main \\"riff\\", there was a lot of the same song structure.  I then realized I was quite deficient in Stevie Wonder music.<br /><br />Then I listened to it.  I was quite amazed at how much of Stevie Wonder's music I actually knew!  As I listened to more of the music, I realized I knew just about all of this stuff, just not by name.  To be honest, when I sat down to listen, I thought this would be one of these knee jerk purchases I make, which I later go \\"Why did I buy this?\\"  Not this one, I enjoyed it a lot, especially the more I realized I knew.  It's hard to quantify his music - some might say \\"funk\\", but that doesn't seem right.  I just know it's good music.  Worth picking up.
1582701709|2.0|Like your mother used to say.  It's good medicine to be reminded, repeatedly in several different ways, that the scripts that we play in our mind can lead to failure, and that rewriting those scripts can lead to success.  And so it is a good argument.  Or, The Secret is not so much an argument but an experience. <br /> <br />But then, it takes it farther.  The Secret is basically a religion, and the God in this religion is basically your mind.  It is not psychology anymore; it is magic.   <br /> <br />Not only is it a religion, it is a calvinist-type religion, where it is your fault that the holocaust happened to you or that you are fat, etc.   <br /> <br />So I don't buy it, but I don't buy Santa Claus, and yet a lot of people think it is a good thing for kids to believe anyway, right?  George Santayana didn't believe in God but he was still a practicing Catholic, because he thought it was good to believe in it.
B000NA77YO|5.0|When I started listening to Black Sabbath in 1981, Ronnie James Dio was the current vocalist, and [[ASIN:B000002KMY Mob Rules]] was the current album. So I'm familiar - very familiar - with the first 13 songs on this CD. When Black Sabbath got back together with Ozzy in 1997, I figured that was pretty much it, the Dio Years (and the others, too) would be gone forever. Well, fortunately in 2006, the word came down that there would be a compilation CD (this one) in 2007 based off of \\"The Dio Years\\" of Black Sabbath. Dio's two previous tenures in the band produced three studio albums, and one live album. This CD is a decent cross section of the tunes from those three albums.<br /><br />Like any other compilation album, there's always someone's personal choices as to what they think should have been left off, and put on. I would have personally left off \\"I\\" and replaced it with \\"Computer God\\", which is a far better song. I also would have put the studio version of \\"Children of the Sea\\" on here, instead of the version from \\"Live Evil\\". Perhaps also replacing Lonely is the Word with \\"Time Machine\\". But that didn't happen. The 13 older songs here are all great (except for maybe the live version of Children of the Sea). You can't go wrong with this compilation.<br /><br />But this isn't just a simple compilation. There's three new songs. They are \\"The Devil Cried\\", \\"Shadow of the Wind\\", and \\"Ear in the Wall\\". During Interviews, Tony Iommi said of the three new songs \\"There's one for everybody - a medium one, a slow one, and a fast one\\". He's right. The songs are that distinctive to me. Ear is my favorite of the three, it evokes memories of \\"Neon Knights\\", one of the best Dio era tracks. Shadow of the Wind is your usual slow powerful Black Sabbath track, and \\"Devil Cried\\" is a good track as well musically. I'm not terribly fond of the lyrics, though. They cross the line into cheese for me, but the song behind them is quite good. It's a mixed bag, that one.<br /><br />As a whole, this compilation is well worth it, especially for the remastered versions of the tracks.

1400063515|1.0|Stirred by the mention of \\"uncertainty\\" (a pet topic), I purchased this zany refutation of everything conventional.  A total contrarian, and full of cynicism, I'm not really sure even still what this author advocates... that we should NOT plan for tomorrow, because the sun might not rise?  To buy flood insurance?? Who knows? - Because he certainly proposes that we can't learn ANYTHING from experience.  He says it's the 9/11s and Tsunamis that have a great impact in our lives. How true, and yet most of us cannot ignore the \\"small hours\\" (Rob Thomas's latest song about poignant moments) or the individual people who have had huge impacts upon us. So what exactly is his point?  Can we truly say that we shouldn't plan on going to college, and someday actually attend because of the random tornados that might intervene? Or on some day having children? Give me a break.  This author's very metaphor of a \\"black swan\\" being rare, unpredictable, and big impact is inappropriate... Please -- I ask you -- what big impact does a black swan have, or ever had upon the first one's discovery? Why didn't he name the book \\"earthquake\\" -- Now there's an unpredictable, rare and big impact event!!  When you read some of the names of theorists this author has insulted, it becomes apparent that he has some real issues, and is in a deep search for some attention from anywhere he can get it. Self-discredited, he doesn't like Bell curves -- well that's because this individual is way out in six sigma land -- an outlier to be ignored. That unpredictable things will happen is not argued, but that we should not have logical expectations is inane. Disappointed -- This book won't sell, despite a snazzy look and (poor) metaphor. It is of little value to anyone who wants to make things happen in the real, mostly predictable, world.
B00005JPFH|2.0|Clocking in at an interminable two hours and twenty minutes, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a movie desperately in need of some serious streamlining.  There is such a plethora of characters, plotlines, villains and monsters - all vying for attention and getting in each others' way in the process - that the movie feels as if it has been assembled by a committee rather than having arisen from a single artist's organic vision.<br /><br />The ostensible selling point of \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is that the meek and mild-mannered Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) dons a mysterious black suit that suddenly turns him into a heartless, cranky bad guy.  The suit, which is actually a creepy-crawly creature from outer space that changes the personality of whomever it clings to, is only one of four villains Spidey has to contend with here - in as clear a case of malefactor overload as we've encountered in quite some time.  No wonder Spider-Man looks so worn out (we seriously thought it might just be the by-product of sequel fatigue).  The other foes include his friend, Harry Osborn, aka New Goblin (James Franco), who still believes Parker was responsible for his father`s death (\\"old\\" Goblin, if anybody`s keeping track); Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual murderer of Parker`s uncle who has been transformed into a giant killer sandman; and a cocky little newspaper photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is determined to snap a photo of Spider-Man doing something bad so as to tarnish the superhero`s hitherto sterling reputation around town (Brock becomes a victim of the dark suit as well).<br /><br />One would think that with all this occupying the hero, the scenarists (Ivan Raimi, Alvin Sargent and writer/director Sam Raimi) wouldn`t have much time left over for romantic entanglements, but one would be wrong in that assumption, for a great deal of the film is devoted to the relationship between Parker and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who has become a tremendously needy, whiney and self-pitying character in this installment.  In fact, so tedious is the romance this time around that whatever charisma and charm Maguire and Dunst exuded as a couple in the previous two films has been completely wiped out on this occasion.  While I must concede that they are both tremendously likable actors, I think they may have gone once too often to the well with these particular roles.  Maguire's impossibly sweet and good-natured demeanor has become particularly annoying at this point (although he isn`t all that convincing when he`s trying to play the bad-boy villain either).<br /><br />I've never been much of a fan of Spider-Man, either in comic book form or in the movies, but one of the reasons why \\"Spider-Man 2\\" worked as a film and the others haven't is because, in that movie, Parker's crippling self-doubts about whether or not he was really cut out to be a superhero gave a depth to the character that was psychologically sound and which made it easy for the audience to identify with him.  In \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" however, Parker essentially has his \\"evil\\" thrust upon him from an outside source and, thus, that key psychological dimension is now lacking.  Instead, the filmmakers have decided to really turn on the waterworks in this film, with just about everybody breaking down in tears at one point or another, culminating in an ending so syrupy and sappy that both dieters and diabetics should probably leave the theater a good fifteen minutes before the close of the story.<br /><br />That pretty much leaves the special effects, which run the gamut from decent (they still haven't really figured out how to make Spider-Man's \\"flying\\" very convincing on screen) to spectacular (the Sandman is a really cool creature, indeed).  The fight scenes are impressively hectic and noisy (which may explain the headache I developed halfway through the film), but it is rather difficult to develop much of a personal rooting interest in the outcome when a group of what are essentially invincible figures are battling it out for supremacy.  And talk about villain overkill!<br /><br />With \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" the superhero's movie batting-average drops from an impressive .500 to a middling .333.  Let's hope he can raise it back up the next time he steps up to the plate.ttling it out for supremacy.  And talk about villain overkill!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|A wonderful version of Jane Eyre, where every look and every touch exuded romance between our hero and heroine long before words passed their lips.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This was a complete disappointment.  The director reduced James Bond to a brutish oaf devoid of finess. The actor portraying Bond did not pull it off.  I saw the original when it was first released, and this strayed entirely too far off mark.

0743496728|3.0|I love Picoult's books for the first 98 percent, and this book is no exception.  With the exception of My Sisters Keeper, I get the feeling she doesnt know how to end the story.  The ending in this story was not at all believable.  The characters are well developed and you feel like you know them, but in this book, there is no way the main female lead would have participated in the massacre.  Her books are starting to sound the same with the same not believeable endings (see The Pact).  She doesn't know how to end a book and the volume is getting \\"Pattersonish\\"
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Great Movie! Back to status of Dr No and From Russia with Love. No farfetched gagets and corny one liners. More Realistic, if you could call it that. Bring back a Male \\"M\\"! Then it would be Excellent.

B00005JPCF|5.0|I ended up seeing this moving while I was at someone's house, and they had put it on for the kids. I ended up sitting down and watching the entire movie with them! This is my favoritre animated movie since Finding Nemo came out. This is one of those movies that make you feel warm and happy after watching it. I liked it so much I went out and bought it and made my husband watch it with me the next day! <br /> <br />I thought it would be your typical \\"different from the crowd story of acceptance\\" film, and although it had some typical child movie themes, the way it was done was so original and entertaining. I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't seen it, so that's all I'll say-but I highly reccommend this film.
B0007M22TI|5.0|If only I had half their talent. What an incredible gift. I have watched the video's and listen to their CD's over and over again and enjoyed every minute. Buy it!! You won't be disappointed.
B0000844I8|4.0|I like this movie. I've liked it ever since I first saw it in theatrical release and I liked it enough to buy this DVD \\"Ultimate Edition\\" a few years ago. Despite this, however, I'm finding it hard to explain exactly why.<br /><br />There's nothing profound or particularly clever in STARGATE. It's not outstanding in any way. In fact, as the professional reviews above point out, it's pretty hokey. But, if you like this type of hokey scifi adventure, you'll probably like STARGATE, too. As with INDEPENDENCE DAY, the Indiana Jones movies, or the STAR WARS movies, it's just fun to sit back and watch (not to compare it to those flicks, but it's in the same genre). The good guys win and the bad guys get what they deserve when the dust clears. The plot's pretty predictable, but there's lots of action and a few tense moments. Going through the star gate for the first time, not knowing what's on the other side, gives you a little tingle if you haven't seen the movie before.<br /><br />STARGATE is another fun ride for fans of the scifi/adventure movie genre. If you like this kind of movie, don't miss this one.
B00005JMXX|2.0|I finally decided to do it. After much deliberation, I've finally decided to review Roland Emmerich's \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". I must admit I liked his work on \\"Independence Day\\". The special effects in that movie achieved the loftiest of heights, creating a truly mesmerizing experience that entertained even though the whole thing suffered under a slew of plot holes the size of the Titanic. Unfortunately, Emmerich decided to indulge his appetite for left-wing politics with \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". The subject? Global warming, of course! It's the new religion for millions of idiots with sad lives who have nothing better to do with their time. I think the whole global warming phenomenon is a bunch of bunk, a pseudo-scientific con job bolstered with shoddy \\"facts\\" that appeals to the media due to its lurid, sensationalistic potentialities. This film does absolutely nothing to advance the idea of global warming. In fact, it probably hurts the cause in ways unanticipated by the director. Oh well. No global warming induced sweat off my brow. Of course, none of this means I wouldn't watch the film. I'll always give a mindless action flick a go, even when said flick reeks of far left-wing pabulum.<br /><br />I initially wept over the appearance of Dennis Quaid in the role of main character Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist (say that five times real fast) deeply concerned about warning signals he's receiving from Mother Nature. Then I decided to forgive him and just watch the movie. Hall claims that computers tell him that a new Ice Age is coming down the pike. He tries to warn people at some conference, but laughter essentially ushers him right out of the room. In films, laughing at leftists means disaster in the near future. And sure enough, weird stuff starts happening. Like what? Oh, the usual. Snow in warm climates, heavy winds knocking planes out of the sky, killer tornadoes wiping out Los Angeles, a tidal wave and freezing temperatures engulfing New York City, England icing over, massive super storms sending temperatures plunging in the northern half of the globe. Like I said, the usual. The special effects showing the disasters unfolding are pretty cool. I liked the reporter in L.A. dying horribly as a result of the tornadoes destructive power. I hope he believed in global warming. The New York scenes work well too, especially the tanker floating through the city streets. Pity about England, though.<br /><br />Anyway, enough talk about the effects. Emmerich, having heard something about \\"characters\\" and \\"a story\\" somewhere in his career, tries to pull at our heartstrings with myriad plot lines both big and small. For example, Jack Hall's precocious kid Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) just happened to head to the Big Apple before the weather took a turn for the worse. He'll spend most of his time trying to get fellow student Laura (Emmy Rossum) to warm up to him (pun intended) during the time they seek shelter in the New York City library. Jack's wife Lucy (Sela Ward), a doctor by trade, spends her time weathering the disaster by taking care of a terminally ill cancer patient. Ian Holm shows up as a Scottish meteorologist long enough to turn the lights out in England. As for Jack, he foregoes helping the United States survive the storm in order to take a nice trek up to New York in order to save his estranged son. How heroic! How stupid! All sorts of threatening situations unfold, usually laughably, before this two-hour piece of propaganda shudders to a stop.  The conclusion plays around with the irony of Americans having to head to Mexico in order to survive the disaster. A[...] Ain't that a kick in the head!<br /><br />A laugh a minute, this \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". It's less a film and more a collection of jaw dropping inconsistencies, cackhanded dialogue, and shock and awe special effects. I won't kid around about the effects--they're awesome and superbly rendered. The unfolding calamity is the only reason to watch the movie. The rest of what we see onscreen is, as my 8th grade science teacher used to say, dumber than a box of rocks. Are we really supposed to believe these super storms, the size of continents, could form this quickly? And why isn't the southern hemisphere affected in some way? How can the temperature drop to at least minus 150 degrees yet we see characters ambling around outside? How can you drive and walk from Washington, D.C. to New York City in these conditions, and do it in a matter of a few days? The answer to all these niggling questions, and others, is simply this: it's in the script. The almighty script trumps all manner of problematic plot holes. Maybe we should use copies of the script to plug the hole in the ozone layer, or provide shade for our rapidly warming planet. You got a better idea?<br /><br />If you're willing to turn your brain off before starting the DVD player, you'll probably make it through \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" relatively unscathed. If you don't turn your brain off before watching, though, you risk serious and irreparable damage on such a scale that you'll resemble Al Gore for the rest of your life. Extras on the disc include a couple of commentaries from Emmerich and assorted personnel, a couple of deleted scenes that add nothing to the monstrosity we just watched, a sound demo, and a DVD-ROM featurette that I didn't bother to investigate. Not much for a \\"blockbuster,\\" but I see a double disc release has also come out. If you really like the film, pick that up instead. Lastly, an aside: Sela Ward is the most gorgeous woman on the planet. Her presence in the film eased some of the pain I felt from watching such a huge piece of misinformation. I'm ecstatic that she survived the film and went back to her career in television. Call me, Sela!en is, as my 8th grade science teacher used to say, dumber than a box of rocks.

1416914285|3.0|This novel seems to have garnered a reputation for being either loved or hated immediately. Frankly, I don't understand why. There were great things about it and horrible things about it.     The concept is original and fascinating. Epic fantasy in Manhattan has never been done before, and the urban setting grounds a novel that could have otherwise been painfully melodramatic. The pacing was perfect. The structure lacked nothing; it flowed well and kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending was unsatisfying and abrupt, but Clare has had a chronic problem with endings in the past so it came as no surprise. What I love about Clare's style is that the snappy dialogue and wry wit employed throughout the novel prevent it from taking itself too seriously. Just when melodrama looms on the horizon, one of the characters will make a joke that disperses it completely. The dialogue is superb, the repartee nothing short of hilarious. Clare had me in stitches one moment, in terrified apprehension the next. Her writing is wonderfully volatile, flashing unpredictably (but not implausibly) from hilarity to tragedy, roaring action to quiet introspection.       On the other hand, the characters disappointed me in a huge way. The main character, sixteen year-old Clary Fray, lacked originality entirely. I can't think of a thing that stood out as unique or captivating about her character; she was woefully two-dimensional. A self-described \\"shy\\" young woman(never exhibits the trait once), she doesn't know she's beautiful and has a feisty, stubborn attitude. The male lead, mysterious Shadowhunter Jace Wayland, is marginally better, but doesn't strike me as fully realized. The supporting characters sometimes outshone the lead characters, particularly the glitter-infused, Asian, cross-dressing, half human, half warlock character Magnus Bane, a personal favorite of mine, as well as Simon, Clary's loveably average best friend, who was possibly the only character that didn't come across as unrealistic and larger-than-life. Clare often sacrifices authenticy for wit or drama, but not with Simon, who is refreshingly mundane and grounded. The villain, aside from having a fantastic name, seemed cliche and washed out. I don't understand what happened with the characters here; in the past I believed that Clare had a special talent for invoking character in a subtle and authentic way. These characters are a joke compared to those I've seen her capable of rendering in the past.     The plot fared no better. I predicted each \\"twist\\" long before it was revealed. The Star Wars parallels became unbearable, and anyone who has read Harry Potter with any attention to detail whatsoever can draw the obvious connections. Lucian and Remus Lupin are incredibly similar; Valentine and Voldemort could be cousins, Valentine and Anakin could be brothers. And of course, the Jace/Luke Clary/Leia aspect of the novel factored heavily into play. The plot is the weakest element of this novel; too cliche to like, too strange to love. However, it incorporates themes that most YA novels shy away from, such as racial supremacy and homosexuality. For this, I commend it.     There were inconsistencies in facts and POV, and yet the novel as a whole functioned well.     I'd say that this series has enormous potential; hopefully Clare will use the next to installments to flesh out her characters and spruce up the overused plot devices. I attribute the general shakiness of these elements to the fact that this is her first novel, and the transition from fanfiction to original fiction is clearly jarring. Already armed with a fantasy world, characters with potential, and backstory, City of Blood will undoubtedly feel less strained than this first installment.       Bottom line: The novel is as good as most YA titles, but not as good as Clare can do or has done in the past.     The weaknesses include shallow characters, cliche plot, and metaphors/similes that sometimes made me want to tear my hair right out of my scalp in frustation.     The strengths include pacing, setting, structure, style, and dialogue. If you want a fast, witty, enjoyable read, give this book a try, but don't expect too much, especially if you've read her previous work.
B00005JPFH|4.0|Spidey, everyone's favorite webslinger, has returned to the summer box office....reloaded with twice the amount of villains, 3 times the amount of action and triple the romance.  Now the question on everyone's mind....is it as good as the other two?<br /><br />Well, not really.  Its not a bad film by any means but the third go around lost a little of the charm.  Tobey Maquire remains endearing as lovable nerd, Peter Parker, who is a diligent student by day and crime fighter every available minute of the day.  Kirsten Dunst is also back as Mary Jane, Peter's girlfriend who, in this film, is having an emotional meltdown.  And, James DeFranco, returns as well becoming the New Goblin, reviving his rivalry and hatred for his former friend, Peter Parker.  JK Simmons also gives us laughs as stressed out and Spidey hatin' Daily Bugle editor, J Jonah Jameson.<br /><br />New additions include Topher Grace, who does a decent job as Eddie Brock, who eventually becomes the evil Venom.  Thomas Hayden Church is the Sandman, a onetime crook who is linked to the death of Peter's Uncle Ben.  And then there is the beautiful Gwen Stacey, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who throws a little tension into the Peter/Mary Jane romance.<br /><br />So with all the amped-up action sequences, the extra stars and big budget you'd expect that Spidey 3 would trounce its predecessors.  The problem is this----sometimes you can simple OVERDO IT!  This is the case with Spiderman 3.  Things are so jam packed with extra villains and all the action sequences (my favorite being a scene at the beginning with Gwen Stacey and a runaway crane) that the story seems to just fall into the background.  Things are rushed this time to get us to Spidey vs Venom/Sandman and some things (such as the alien lifeforce that attaches itself to its host) go completely unexplained.<br /><br />With a record breaking weekend haul of 148 million domestically, it is certain we are hungry for a new Spiderman movie.  Let's hope, however, that our next viewing of the worlds favorite webslinger returns to a simpler, more story driven movie with enough action to keep us interested but not enough to bog the film down.  Worth watching---a good popcorn movie but not as good as the best in the series, Spiderman 2 or the original.'s hope, however, that our next viewing of the worlds favorite webslinger returns to a simpler, more story driven movie with enough action to keep us interested but not enough to bog the film down.

B00000G3PA|1.0|What a horrible movie.  If I started talking about what's wrong with it and why I hated it I would have to spend several hours on this review so I'm not going to do that.  Just think of everything you've ever hated in those touchy, feely, blindly pro-American, self-righteous movies whose logic is so bad that it often contradicts even its own self.      Are you thinking about that now?    Multiply it by 100 and that equals Armageddon.

Mounting bills --- so what, people will wait until tomorrow.  Unhappy wife --- she'll be happy tomorrow.  Then it hits the fan.  But instead of folding and crumbling in self-pity, or relinquishing his son, this man chooses to take a chance he knows has the best possibility for a secure, long term pay off.<br /><br />There are so many lessons in this film on attitude, self-worth and never giving up on the right thing.  In such a competitive environment, the film showed what to do to keep up with and pass the competition.  This man had drive.  At the Day Care, I was glad they showed a Dad being concerned with the care of his son.  It was good to see a Dad answering his sons questions and never ignoring him.  And even though the showing of his elation was brief, I cried.  For all the struggle, the breath of relief was a huge one.<br /><br />Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, available to us all.
B00000I41G|5.0|Kenny Burrell is a great jazz guitarist, but he really shines on blues.  This set is a quartet setting with bass, drums, guitar and tenor, and it's all blues in various forms.  Stanley Turrentine really shines on this CD, too.  If you love great blues, you will love this CD.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|An excellent comedy series.  I would never have thought that a plot which is based on the totally unrealistic assumption that teenage children can patiently sit around to hear from their father telling them with every detail (for hours) how he met their mother, can be so good and hilarious.  Both the write up and the extremely good chemistry between the actors make for a fantastic and very enjoyable comedy series.  Not to be missed.  If you have enjoyed sitcoms like \\"Friends' or \\"Two guys and a girl\\" you will simply love this one.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|The 2005 superhero family fantasy \\"Sky High\\" is about a boy named Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) whose parents, Steve & Josie Stronghold (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston respectively), are famous superheroes named \\"The Commander\\" and \\"Jetstream\\".  Steve (\\"The Commander\\") has super-strength and Josie (\\"Jetstream\\") can fly.  Naturally, Steve & Josie believe that their son Will will grow up to be a superhero, so they enroll him in the exclusive superhero high school called \\"Sky High\\", so named because it floats several thousand feet in the air thanks to an anti-gravity device.  When new students (freshmen) arrive at Sky High, they are separated into one of two groups: heroes or sidekicks.  A hero has a real superpower, whereas a sidekick may have a power, but not something powerful.  The man responsible for determining which kids are heroes and which are sidekicks is Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell, who may be remembered for portraying Elvis Presley in the 2002 film [[ASIN:B0001LQJMQ \\"Bubba Ho-tep\\"]], as well as his roles in the various \\"Evil Dead\\" films).  Upon arrival, the new freshmen are met by Sky High's principal, Principal Powers (Lynda Carter, best known for portraying Wonder Woman in the 1970's TV series of the same name), before being tested by Coach Boomer.  The determination of whether a child is a hero or a sidekick determines not only what classes they attend, but also their social status: sidekicks are generally not socially accepted by the heroes.  Hence, when Will cannot initially demonstrate any superhero powers, he is designated as a sidekick along with most of the new students who rode to Sky High with him in the flying school bus driven by Ron Wilson (Kevin Heffernan).  Of course, Steve & Josie aren't particularly happy that their son may only be a sidekick, but Will may only be a late bloomer, as he demonstrates when he gets into a fight with another student, the flame-throwing Warren Peace (Steven Strait), in the school's cafeteria.  Once it becomes apparent that Will is a hero and not a sidekick, he's moved from the sidekick classes to the hero classes where he gets to spend time with the beautiful senior named Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who may be more than she appears.  Will tries to continue to be friends with his former fellow-sidekicks, including his very dear friend Layla Williams (Danielle Panabaker), but Gwen and her friends want to separate Will from them.  As the film progresses, the stage is set for a climatic ending. <br /> <br />With good special effects, good acting, an interesting story and good direction (under Mike Mitchell), the family-friendly \\"Sky High\\" is a very entertaining film for young & old alike.  Those familiar with the Harry Potter stories written by J.K. Rowling may find some similarities between Sky High high school where students are separated and Hogwartz with its separation of students into four houses.  However, whereas Hogwartz separates children based upon personality traits, Sky High separates students based upon abilities.  Overall, I rate \\"Sky High\\" with a well-deserved 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.   <br />
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This DVD edition was superb. The casting was excellent. I've got three versions of this favorite story and I would rank this one as #1. (Have the Timothy Dalton version and the 1944 version with Orson Welles.)Toby Stephens gave us a Rochester that has less sarcasm than the others. He was gentler in his abrasiveness and I thought that was a nice change. Ruth Wilson was terrific as Jane. How she managed to be strong, quiet, homely, lovely all at the same time was great to watch.
B000085RTR|5.0|Fantastic! That's how I can review this album!!! Nowadays, Kamelot is one of the best bands in the 'melodic'-metal genre. Criative, inovative and so on! <br /> <br />Khan's voice is really great! This album is worth since the first music! And besides that, this special version comes in a beautiful digipack-version, with one bonus and a temporary tatoo. A version only for true-fans! <br /> <br />I assure you, buy it and you will never regret!
0061139378|5.0|It is not hard for Neil Gaiman to write a really good book.  Although this is more geared to a younger reader, it is still enjoyable.  It has all of the Gaiman touches of his longer books.  Definitely a good book, and quite scary.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Ferris is easily one of my favorite movies, especially from the 80s. It was fun, hip and in style then, and watching it now it's fun to laugh at the clothing and hairstyles you remember wearing. Though Ferris and his friends seem outside that 80s style bubble and will always seem timeless to me, his charm and ability to get what he wants, even at the cost of others, is what always draws me back. Always a lot of fun seeing him outsmart his principle and drive his older sister to the brink, but in the end, everything turns out A-OK.  Why they never made a sequel I will never know.
0060853980|5.0|Neil Gaiman is very talented.  This book is definitely one of his very best. I have read several and I have loved them all, but I may be biased. Not only is the story great and full of his signature dark plot-lines, but the book is often funny as well.  It involves magic and black magic, but it also has angels...making it chockfull of mythical imagery. The well sculpted characters and the way the book meanders through their lives in a clever fashion keeps the reader engaged.  This book and author are worthy of high praise. While it isn't as dark as his other works like Neverwhere and American Gods, it isn't a kids book either.  Good for ages 12 & up is my recommendation.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|another great movie that i grew up watching, the scary parts are still a little freaky and i just loved this version as a child. It is very good for opening the imagination, and i will cherish it for a long time!
B000HBK3MM|3.0|Simple relaxing music after a rough day at work...Not Nina Simone, but who is?
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I think I've hit upon the reason newer Rush music doesn't do it for me like the older stuff, and for me , that means pre Grace Under Pressure album.  Since that album,  they've had bunches and bunces of hit or miss recorded moments , nothing was ever terribly awful, but nothing quite hit the heights of the earlier stuffs uniqueness of sound. This CD sounds not too much unlike Vapor Trails to me. That CD sits unlistened too after a couple of plays when it came out,  on my shelf. When I browse thru my CD's and wanna hear Rush, I inevitably pick something older. Why? This isn't bad music I'd say, although Geddys tendency to strech out words into 2  or 3 syllables has a certain irritating quality to it LOL. There is a certain 'genericness' to the riffs , grooves , tempo and singing and I never felt that with their early stuff. However, you could also argue that music that really hits a zenith , can be tough to perpetuate. Think about the Stones...still kicking, but have any of their albums of the last 25 years reached the brilliance and acclaim of  Sticky Fingers or Exile on Main Street, or even Goats Head Soup? Probably not. All this aside, Rush is still incredible to go see perform live, even the newer stuff.

B0000009SE|5.0|Great music and band.  Every track is awesome...all four songs are definitely worth it!  Sal Marquez's trumpets are one of my favorite highlights of Waka/Jawaka.  This is a cd for all music lovers, jazz lovers, Zappa lovers, and people who particularly dug The Grand Wazoo and Imaginary Diseases.  Upon first listening to it it became one of my top 5 Zappa Albums (Jazz From Hell, Make A Jazz Noise Here, The Yellow Shark, You Are What You Is, One Size Fits All, and the You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore series are some of my favorites).  I own over 40 of his cds and love them all, but this one quickly rose to the top of the list for me.

0895260131|5.0|PRO-Americans need to read every word in this book in order to understand clearly what the ANTI-American liberals are attempting to do with the USA, siding as they are with the Islamofascists.  ANTI-Americans and others in the liberal swamps need to read this to understand that we KNOW what they are trying to do with our country, and that we are not going to tolerate the overthrow of our American way of life.  You cannot be both pro-American and pro-Islamofascist at one and the same time.  Make up your minds and vote one way or the other.  If you are confused, read this book, or have a reasonable adult read it to you.
B000NA28I4|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie.  Ending was left open for maybe a 2nd?  I sure hope so, tho I know the box office didn't do that well.  Oh Well!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|The Holiday is a romantic film by Nancy Myers and has a lot of big names in it: Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Jack Black. If you enjoy a heartwarming, romantic comedy, you will love this movie. If you have wondered what could happen if you just picked up and basically exchanged your life with a stranger, then you will also love this movie. It is definitely a 'chick flick'.  My husband bemoaned the fact that no one was killed, there was nothing blown up, etc. I found the movie captivating and found myself smiling a lot as sweet moments occured.  <br /> <br />This is a story of two women who are having love life and personal problems.  They find one another through Home Exchange and within a day, they have left their troubles behind and journeyed to new lands. Kate Winslett, who has very little self-respect, finds a bushel! Her outgoing personality attracts those around her and while she is helping others, in the end she helps herself to become stronger. <br /> <br />Cameron Diaz is a powerful, wealthy woman who is emotionally blocked. Her journey into love finds her overcoming past sorrows and learning that loving and taking chances can be very rewarding.   <br /> <br />Jack Black and Jude Law melted my heart with their smiles.  They both did a fantastic job.  I highly recommend this movie!
0977326403|5.0|This is the first book that I have been able to put my hands on that deals directly with helping non-profits and churches step up in their organizational approach to excellence.

0679879269|4.0|I have read these three books to my sons out loud.  They are terrific.  This last one moves a bit slower than certainly the first, and maybe the second, but meanwhile, it still has plenty of shining moments.  I cannot imagine not reading it if you have started this series.  It is a wonderful trilogy probably best suited for jr. high and above, but I have read it to a 9 and 12 year old, and they absolutely love it!  I will admit that I even sometimes have to sneak a peek ahead, as I cannot wait to see what comes next!  I recommend this series and book!
1563894696|5.0|I read this 260 page graphic novel in about 2 days. The murder mystery aspect  was very engaging and if you are into that at all, I would recommend you checking it out. Theres also some side aspects that make it great like the use of familiar villains. There is a lot of them yet they are incorporated in the story so well. I've recently began purchasing graphic novels so I actually benefited from not knowing the identity of certain people. If you are a novice like me in the DC comic world, you might appreciate it like I did.
B0007PALRU|5.0|Well, this movie was great nonetheless, but it was fast shipping, and great service.  All in all, 5 stars!
B000N3SS80|4.0|This is a beautiful album where J.Lo shows the strength of her vocals and continues to show us her Latin sultriness with seductive rhythm and lyrics.  Her words reflect depth, passion and power.  I am frankly shocked by the other reviews that say this album is not \\"true J.Lo\\" and she's \\"trying to be a serious artist\\".  My opinion is those reviews demonstrate the mental barriers in the mind of the reviewer and not of J.Lo.  <br /> <br />I don't understand Spanish to any significant degree but I can appreciate the awesome music and the power behind her words.  Her albums have never had the fluffy nothingness of Gwen , Britney, or Fergie.. those I consider \\"entertainers\\".  Lopez has always musically been an artist to me (now the movies is another discussion... ).  The one criticism I have is that the album is a little ballad heavy however she has enough up-beat songs in there that I don't get bored and I think the album flows nicely.  However it is not a dance the whole way through album by any means.  Just good, beautiful music.
B000KQGX1Y|4.0|I really bought the CD for one song after watching their live in concert on our local Public Broadcast.  I just fell in love with the song Caledonia.  Every time I hear the song it makes me feel like smiling.<br /><br />The whole CD is wonderful!!  I would hightly recommend it to anyone who likes Celtic music.  The Live concert is also sold too!
B00005MP58|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.  It is long, yes, but well worth watching if you have any faint adoration of Jane Austen.
B000001FYL|5.0|This album is in my top 3 favorite Bon Jovi albums (even tho it is a solo record). In this record, you really get to hear just how powerful and gifted Jon's vocals are (with some exceptions - such as in NJ - usually only demonstrated live) - Santa Fe solidified in my mind, the assertion that Jon Bon Jovi was one of the most gifted singers in rock & pop music with very few people (in rock/pop) able to come close to his vocal abilities.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This recording exemplifies the limitless possibilities of the recording medium.  Sutherland never sang the role of Turandot live.  She certainly could have but the focus of most of her international career was the music of the 18th century.  This performance came as a huge surprise to the public when it was first issued on LPs in the 1970s. She's nothing less than a phenomenal Turandot.  Her singing is flawless.  Perfect. <br /> <br />For me, bad habits and self conscious effects plagued much of Caballe's singing.  Her voice was never a beautiful instrument but she used her voice beautifully.  Sometimes the famous pianissimo singing she was famous for sounded overly luxuriant and outside the meaning of the words and music.  There are times on the recording where vowels and consonants become sounds.  Her performance here is good but I much prefer Tebaldi whose incredibly beautifully voice is used for full expression.  Caballe's voice is more calculated.  Effective yes, but I can still hear the wheels turning. <br /> <br />The main attraction of this recording for many is the youthful Calaf of Luciano Pavarotti.  By the time of this recording, Pavarotti was perhaps the most famous opera singer in the world and here he is caught in full youthful bloom.  The tone rivals the great tenors of the century.  His singing is fully expressive with an irresistible lushness and expansive quality.  The high notes have ping and in general, he gives a gorgeously sung and dramatic portrayal. <br /> <br />I have never warmed up to Mehta's bombastic approach to everything he conducts but here it works extremely well and the playing of the New Philharmonia Orchestra and John Aldiss Choir is superb. <br /> <br />Is this recording better than RCA's famous living stereo edition? No, but it clearly is equal to that recording.  In fact, this is one of the best opera recordings of the century. <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The singing was superb as was the music and scenery.  An extra star should go to Máiréad Nesbitt for her superb fiddle playing as she moved about with the grace of a butterfly.  Having once heard this group on PBS, I could hardly wait to hear more of their remarkable talent.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Out of the 20 or so Classic Rock DVD concerts I've watched this year, Live at Massey Hall was musically the best. This DVD is not visually flashy due the 1970's technology but the content is well worth the price. I think this concert would be enjoyable for any Classic Rock fan and a must for Neil Young fans. Just Neil, a couple of guitars and a piano, he's always at his best when he plays alone!
0618551050|5.0|A very amusing read. <br /> <br />The book is divided clearly in two parts. In the first and longest, the current status of basic physical sciences is described, of course with the aim to emphasize that the string theory has made it go into a blind alley. The experiment data that are still unexplained are presented, since they should provide the basis for verification or falsification of the new theories. Even only for this, the book is worth the read, since this kind of up to date information is not easy to find. <br /> <br />In the second and shorter part, the status of the academic institutions and the social aspects of the research in basic physics are presented, from the point of view of the author. <br /> <br />Both parts are very subjective. Smolin opinions are certainly not mainstream, and the reader should go for counter-opinions from the other side. But this subjectivity is the real value of the book. <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, it has been very important that somebody has dared to say out loud what many people are thinking now about physics: they've come to a dead end. I don't know whether it is because physicist took the wrong way, or because most of what can be experimented has already got a theoretical framework, and doing science without experimenting is not possible. Smolin argues this is not the case: doable experiments can show us the way, and he also argues against the antrophic principle. I wouldn't be so sure... <br />
1577314808|1.0|This is a perspective, an immature perspective that could serve as a spring board for further searching for hopefully many, but there are no instructions on gaining this perspective for yourself, if you wanted to, and no instructions on where to go for better advice. The popularity of books like this testifies to the naivete and spiritual immaturity of the American public. Living in the now has it's obvious problems. Tolle says he sat on park benches for almost 2 years. How was that made possible? Did he leave his hat on the sidewalk for coins? He doesn't say. Lacking instruction in how to acheive Tolle's perspective, you could follow in Tolle's footsteps, in which case a nervous breakdown would suffice. Doesn't it make more sense to seek out a spiritual master rather than a guy who had a nervous break down and then consulted with teachers to explain what happened? Who did he get his information from? Why not recommend those people to us? The old cliche about inventing a religion comes to mind.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I've listened to it four times now and each time I have found myself on a different musical adventure --that was totally unexpected.  I loved their last album \\"Vapor Trails\\" and I consider this one to be even better.  I especially like their intrumental tracks. <br /> <br />Ok, I admit that some of their lyrics are a bit cynical and dark, but in my opinion, so is the inspiration for this album  --fundamental christianity. <br /> <br />I cannot wait for their next one.  Go Rush! <br /> <br />
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I purchased the movie \\"The Secret\\".  Loved it.  Great movie.  I then purchased this movie - The Celestine Prophecy.  It's an okay movie to watch, but it didn't provide me with the same degree of inspiration or personal awakening as \\"The Secret\\".  If you're wanting a decent movie to watch for pleasure, buy this.  If you're looking for a movie that is insightful and thought provoking, look for another movie.

B000002VQQ|5.0|It is a bit surprising that there are not more Amazon reviews than there are for Patti Smith's 1975 debut.  After all, Horses is the kind of album - like those by kindred spirits The Velvet Underground and Television - that critics go absolutely bonkers over. (The 2007 Rush album had more reviews within a day of its release.)  Like most such albums, this great praise did not lead to equally great sales. It did, however, result in reverence by the scores of musicians Smith has influenced, and ultimately in her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br /><br />Patti Smith had published a few volumes of poetry in the early 70s, and was part of the Greenwich Village music scene that included guitarist Lenny Kaye and pianist Richard Sohl.  Horses gave her the chance to show off her talents as both a poet and a rocker.  Those who are leery of her 9-minute poetic flourishes will find her shorter, more conventional rock songs quite satisfying.  These include \\"Free Money\\" (about winning the lottery, a decidedly non-poetic topic), the pop-flavored \\"Kimberly\\", and \\"Break It Up\\", which was co-written by Television frontman Tom Verlaine. On \\"Gloria\\", however, Smith sews together the poetic and the conventional perfectly, weaving the Van Morrison classic in and out of her own lyrics, highlighted by the mid-song headfirst plunge into the original without a missed beat. It is so seamless that one might find him/herself unsure of whose lyrics are being sung when.  Drummer Jay Dee Daugherty is extraordinary, driving songs like \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Free Money\\" relentlessly forward.<br /><br />Van Morrison clearly had an important influence on this record, but it is another Morrison - Jim - who is more often cited as an influence on Smith.  I personally have never cared much for this comparison, as I am not a great admirer of Jim Morrison.  However, the comparison is apt, as the tracks \\"Birdland\\" and \\"Land\\" can be interpreted as in the spirit of songs like \\"The End\\" and \\"When the Music's Over\\" by The Doors.<br /><br />Horses is a crucial precurser to punk primarily because it anticipated that genre's sound before it came to fruition.  However, it also anticipated the spirit of punk by looking to the early days of rock 'n roll to capture its youthful and inspired essence.  This is heard not only in \\"Gloria\\", but in the middle section of \\"Land\\", which co-opts the oldie \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\".  While The Ramones would also cover oldies (eg, \\"California Sun\\", \\"Do You Wanna Dance?\\"), they preferred to keep their songs to about 2 minutes.  Smith - like Television after her - was willing to give her songs a much larger canvas.  The fact that Blue Oyster Cult's Allan Lanier, a boyfriend of Smith, was the co-writer of \\"Kimberly\\" and \\"Elegie\\" made this album an all the more bizarre musical stew.  (But the fact that The Velvet Underground's John Cale produced the album seems more appropriate than bizarre.)<br /><br />Nearly 29 years old in November 1975, Patti Smith was no spring chicken when Horses was released.  This gave her something of mother-figure quality to not only the mostly male punks who would follow in her wake, but also to tough-minded female rockers ranging from Siouxsie Sioux in the 70s to Chrissie Hynde and Kim Gordon in the 80s to PJ Harvey and Liz Phair in the 90s.  (And I really like the possibly untrue story that Morrissey and Johnny Marr had their first encounter at a Patti Smith concert.)  Horses may have its soft spots, but its updates on the past and influence on the future make it one of the most essential American recordings ever.Doors.

0316166685|5.0|One word adequately describes this amazing book: family. But we are not talking about the kind of family depicted in 1950's television shows or Norman Rockwell portraits. The Salmon family (\\"like the fish\\") in The Lovely Bones is authentic in every way: the mother feels trapped by her servile role as nurturer and housecleaner in suburban America in the late 1970s; the father is bored with his office job and lives for his evenings at home when he plays with his young son in the back yard or makes model ships in his study. The adolescent sister, Lindsey, is wrapped up in high school sports and her boyfriend. However, the Salmon family has a heavy cross to carry. Each member is trying to cope with an impossible situation- how to grieve the tragic death of a 14-year old daughter and sister, Susie. <br /> <br />It is the narrative voice that makes this novel so exquisitely beautiful and haunting. From her position in Heaven, the murdered family member, Susie, tells the story of her death at the hands of a serial killer, an eccentric neighbor who even the police do not suspect as the perpetrator. Susie observes her family's ongoing grief in the months and years following her death. As a spirit, she is able to crawl under the skin of her family members and actually feel their hidden thoughts and pain. She watches as her father mentally breaks down because he instinctively knows that his odd neighbor, Mr. Harvey, committed the crime and no one, including his wife and the local police, are willing to believe him due to lack of evidence. Susie sees how her mother emotionally closes up following the murder and attempts to dull the pain through adultery and eventual flight to California. She grows to respect her adolescent sister's noble strength as she watches her comfort her father and become a mother to their abandoned young brother.     <br /> <br />Susie is not really in Heaven yet. She is in an in between place where souls apparently seek refuge after sudden and violent deaths. In this case, Susie is in a peaceful but lonely realm full of dogs, gazebos, and other young girls. She is still partly bound to earth and to her family. The chords that draw her to her parents and siblings are strong, and she is not yet willing to sever them. Her family is not willing to let go of her, either.  <br /> <br />I cannot think of any book that I have ever read that tugged at my heart in this way, causing it to strain with sadness for the plight of the characters. As I read, my thoughts would wander to families that I have known or heard about who lost a child, perhaps through terminal illness or a tragic car accident. It is a lifelong  trauma that leaves each family member forever changed, forever sorrowful.  <br /> <br />Word has it that Peter Jackson, the brilliant director of Lord of the Rings, will be making this movie for Dream Works. Better bring a box of Kleenex to the theatre.         <br /> <br />        <br />

As in her recording of the Brahms concerto, Julia Fischer is technically perfect and the recording excellent -- although the orchestra is a bit forward -- but ultimately the perfromance is unmemorable (especially when compared to great recordings like Sitkovetsky/Marriner, Ferras/Kletzki, Oistrakh/Kondrashin and Morini/Horenstein). As in the Brahms, it is hard to understand what all the excitement is about.

B0001CNRBG|4.0|I bought this video to view before we visited the inn where it all happens: Heritage House in Mendocino, CA. As we drove up the coast, we talked about the movie, the moral issues, the actors, and it gave us so much to talk about, we almost missed the view of the Pacific! Just a little dated, but Alan Alda is so magnificent in this that you can put<br /><br />aside your critic's pen and just enjoy. His performance should have brought him an Oscar.
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido's voice has this ethereal feminity to it which invites hope, gladness and serendipity. Almost every song on Life for Rent makes you wonder why you haven't heard it in a while.This came out sometime in 2003 and it still is worth it's weight in gold. I'm not a big pop fan and I don't like Justin Timberlake's music. I'm more of a grunge fan from the mid 90's and a bit psych trance gets my mood going. I'm a big Cranberries fan and I adore voices with range. Dido's voice, however, doesn't quite display range yet manages to comfort one's solitude or multitude. When White Flag came out, the world rocked to it and various remixes were made. She was 32 when this record came out and today she is 35.<br /><br />The disc has 11 songs. There are no songs that are forgettable. Whether you're in a car or in a house made of wood or alone on your bed at night wondering if you should pick up the telephone, her voice will guide your mind. Now before I try display more faulty comprehension, I should conclude by mentioning my three absolute favourite tracks on the disc. See You When You're 40, Mary's in India and Stoned. The title track is maybe the most forgettable one on this disc but there will be days when listeners might have warmed their ears to it.<br /><br />Avoid playing this on earphones. It's meant to be played to your room's walls. Just a thought. Very well, see you when you're 40.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I first caught a glimpse of this performance on PBS, and was very intrigued with what little I saw. I also have Riverdance, and thought this would be a good addition to my Celtic music collection. I was very pleased with the purchase, and look forward to more titles by Celtic Woman. Buy it!
1852691247|5.0|Carle, E. (1969).  The very hungry caterpillar.  New York:  Scholastic, Inc.<br /><br /> Synopsis: Oh the length a caterpillar will go for a delicious meal!  You will wonder just how far this hungry little creature will go to find a satisfying meal to fill his belly.  Carle is a timeless author that continues writing stories that capture and enchant the minds of young children with this tale of a little caterpillar searching to find a fulfilling meal. This caterpillar's story has a beautiful ending.<br /><br /> Evaluation: This story presents the early learning concepts of counting and the days of the week.  The only discrepancy is that in the end the caterpillar builds himself a cocoon.  Moths build cocoons, while butterflies build chrysalises. Carle's story provides children with easy to understand language that they are sure to repeat over and over.  Young children are mesmerized by Carle's unconventional use of smaller pages.  Little fingers cannot help but explore the tiny holes created throughout the book by the hungry little caterpillar.  Eric Carle's vividly painted tissue paper collages continue to draw children into the imaginary worlds he creates.  These simple painted collages are uncluttered on a crisp white background and keep children's attention spans.  The counting patterns assist children with the one to one correspondence needed for early math skills.  As well, children can't help learning the days of the week with this fascinating tale. As youngsters begin to learn to count and recite the days of the week, this story offers children the opportunity to use repeated readings to fully grasp these concepts.  In addition the counting and days of the week patterns provide children with some predictability.

B000002KBU|5.0|Some ethereal force prompted your Metamorpho to review this c.d. This has been part of my considerable archive for some time. Yet, somehow it came to mind and I don't have any clue why. Perhaps it may be the need to frequent some dark cafe and meet Joni with her fishnet stockings and talk of life, and loves, and drink some fine wine. I think she can teach me alot, as well as me teaching her about life. And, in large part, this c.d. is about life, but not only the outward life we all experience, but the life within the soul.<br /><br />I will tell you all, right from the beginning, that I deem this one of the highest recordings of all time to reflect by. She is a dreamer, a person who wants to so desperately to break free, who is fully aware of the shallow games she plays (and others play) and wants nothing more than true love to flourish. However, she is aware that she is her own saboteur and fears winding up lonely and loveless. When it comes to the enigma of the human condition, Joni is without equal on this c.d. There is a real sadness underneath these gems, but that is not to say that Joni can't fix it. It's just that she is helpless and prone to her own personal quirks, which she knows brings her great pain. But still, the songs ring true and this whole outing is an amazing confessional therapy for all to see.<br /><br />First off, Joni's warbling and hitting those high notes might be off-putting to some. To me, they are essential because they emphasis the emotion she is feeling.  And this is, for me, a blessing.<br /><br />This album is a lesson in economy. It is Joni on acoustic guitar; it is Joni on piano. And, when there is background accompaniement, it is sparse and not anywhere near overdone. I think that this only adds to the charm of the album.<br /><br />\\"All I Want\\" is an amazing track. It is a yearning in love. However, she knows that being so vulnerable opens her up to hurt- so she hurts back. Overall, alot is conveyed with the line, \\"Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling, it's the unraveling, and it undoes all the joy that could be\\".  Such great wisdom. But, most of us have a hard time coming to grips with this in our lives. Joni included.<br /><br />\\"My Old Man\\" is a vision of hers. Real or not? But one who can surely keep away her lonesome blues. Sometimes it's hard to qualify her content,  With Joni, it's an aspiration to someplace higher and built on edifices of wishes and dreams. This is what is so amazing about her. \\"Little Green\\" is about bringing up a child within the distance of a broken relationship. Beautiful acoustic conveying the beauty of the child; but with all the nice things, \\"sometimes there'll be sorrow\\". So very melancholy. Wonderful juxtaposition of mood.<br /><br />In \\"Carey\\" she's leaving her lover for home. Yet, it's a joyous ode because she's living in the moment and wants to celebrate the now. Even with the underlying sadness-she toasts to a mean ol' Daddy who is out of sight. In the long run-she must move on. But, she is not sure where she's running to.<br /><br />\\"Blue\\" is amazing and so wistful and tender with loss. Songs are like tatoos. Indelible- and undeniable- and Joni has the sadness of blue stamped on her soul. Listen to the piano on this. So expertly tied to the theme. As far as creating a mood with music- there aren't many that can do what Joni does.<br /><br />\\"California\\" is a lilting tune to having the blues and wanting to return home. However, this time she leaves a man to return to California, that she personifies to a love. \\"Will you take me as I am?\\", a safe question to ask her home but, maybe, not of a lover.<br /><br />\\"This Flight Tonight\\" is jaunty but unsure tune insofar as Joni's emotions are concerned. She is torn between leaving a love for supposed safety- but he's got the lovin' she likes alright. However doubt enters and there is much in the line \\"sometimes i think love is just mythical\\". Is real love just a dream we all fool ourselves to be real?Joni asks this question here-and, believe me, we have to exhume Aristotle to try and resolve this issue. And that's not to say we will, or won't succeed. But, as Joni knows- we have to try.<br /><br />Next up is one of the most wonderous sweet/sad songs I have ever heard in my life. It is \\"River\\" and, to my mind, it hits deep. One of the saddest and most melancholy Christmastime tunes ever written. It is regret- it is a deep yearning to escape the pain. It is a beautiful pain. How she can convey all this with one tune is testimony to her incredible artistry. If you ever lost someone very special-listen at your peril.<br /><br />\\"A Case of You\\" is about how blood and wine get mingled into an addicted love. And, yet, it is bitter and sweet. She is frightened by the devil, and drawn to those that ain't afraid. Her vulnerability has mingled with his strength, thus, she becomes strong enough to deal with the pain of seperation.An amazing tune.<br /><br />By the last tune \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\", with sparse piano, Joni has finally become empowered to deal with a cynic more cynical than she is. Richard was a dreamer, but he totally lost his faith. He puts on songs that are dreaming but, ultimately, settles for, instead of a candle in some small cafe, a house with all the lights on and a t.v. That's how Richard deals with the darkness. For Joni, she's gonna blow the candle out and wait for redemption. Only a phase- so she hopes.<br /><br />In conclusion- there is alot here. And I probably only scratched the suface on all the nuances and revelations revealed within this c.d.<br /><br />This c.d is a testimony to sweet sadness- perhaps the best one I've ever heard. Done so economically but with such a powerful punch. Music doesn't have to have grinding guitars to make an impact. Sometimes, the softness in music is the most pertinent.<br /><br />In any all-around music collection- this one is essential.<br /><br />Now that I'm over this-back to my inane ways! - your Metamorphome, we have to exhume Aristotle to try and resolve this issue.

B000E1ZK50|5.0|I enjoyed the original DVD and I don't see any mentions of the quality on HD DVD. I bought this HD DVD from Amazon and here are my comments:  First of all, if you are not a Vampire, Dracula, Wolfman, or Frankenstein fan then you should not be revewing this DVD. This is without any doubt, the best of these type of movies and in HD even better. In HD details of this movie are nothing short of fansastic, my favorite scenes are Dracula's castle, Dracula's ballroom, Vampires attacking in the courtyard, Kate Beckinsale in the courtyard and ballroom dance with Dracula, Frankenstein's design, Werewolfs detail and much more. The Snow scenes and backround scenes are so detailed. Hugh Jackman's fight against Dr Jeckle, Mr Hide is a classic. How can anyone knock the fun of this movie, I don't know. BTW, this HD DVD has plenty of extras showing how the scenes were filmed. Hope there is another Van Helsing adventure in the works....
B000FGGE68|4.0|Let me first say, I loved this movie when I first saw it in High-Definition.  It was absolutely beautiful, which is one of the huge things about this movie. Even in standard definition, this movie is easy on the eyes. <br /> <br />One problem with this movie is that it appears as if some of the storyline is missing, which apparently it was; somebody cut a two hour movie down to a 90 min. movie.  Because of this, you have to pay an extraordinary amount of attention to this movie, and remember every detail because if you don't, it wont make sense later. <br /> <br />This movie is not great for an action-packed movie night with the kids, or with your buddies, but if you have time to focus on the story, what this movie is is an extraordinary piece of art with lots of symbolism, moments of humor, and huge, awesome action scenes. (And not just any action scenes, the sort of action scene you play out when you're a little kid where every single enemy until the last one falls at your hands) <br /> <br />Super seious Sci-Fi fans will find major MAJOR faults with this movie, but remember, they wet themselves when they see Star Wars, you probably don't. So, if you wanna see a movie that, although it isn't perfect, will probably entertain you, even to the point of making you think, get this one!

0440237688|5.0|Lowry, L. (1993).  The giver.  New York:  Bantam Doubleday Dell Books for Young Readers<br /><br />Synopsis:  Life is perfect when everything is given to you.  Jonas lives a happy life with his family unit.  All his life, Jonas has lived in utopia, a perfect society where no one feels pain, experiences starvation or is ever left to want more.  There are no wars, crimes or fears in his world.  There are rules and guidelines for how each person dresses, wears their hair, and apologizes for transgressions.  Everything is under perfect control.  Or so it seems!  On his 12th birthday, Jonas receives an important assignment and has no idea how it will change his life forever.  After the assignment ceremony, nothing remains the same.  Suddenly Jonas' world is turned upside down.  All the value he found in his life is now a web of lies and a controlled environment.  Set in a futuristic small community environment, Jonas, who has been sheltered from pain and pleasure his whole life, will now become The Receiver of these suppressed memories from the community's past.  As he receives memories, Jonas realizes that all the choices in life are made for the citizens by the Elders.  He begins to understand that the control of their entire lives is the price that the citizens must pay for the community's utopian society.  Once Jonas receives the truth, it \\"colors\\" his whole world forever.<br /><br />Evaluation: Readers quickly realize this story is fantasy.  When Jonas describes the \\"sameness\\", population control, lack of pain, suffering and pleasure, the reader is sure to understand that Jonas' world is a utopian society full of necessity and lacking freedom of choices.  The citizens' experiences do not include color, music, or love.  When Jonas realizes the level of control in his society, he uses this knowledge to become assertive and change his destiny.  Lowry carefully balances the values of freedom with the necessity of security in our lives.  The plot is full of surprises and leaves readers hanging on the edge of their seats.  This book provides an abundance of conversational topics appropriate in multiple settings.  Used in the home or school environments, children are encouraged to analyze the benefits and deficits of a society like Jonas'.  Educators are bound to use this text to compare students' lives with Jonas'.  Students aged 10-17 are likely to find this story captivating.and leaves readers hanging on the edge of their seats.

0684824906|5.0|One of the reasons Lincoln was one of the greatest president is that he was not afraid to take advice from a wide range of people. Every Republican opponent in the election of 1860 was made a member of the cabinet. The cabinet fought like cats and dogs but what held them together was Lincoln himself. Even the leaders who despised Abraham Lincoln came to respect him.<br /><br />If only the current administration was willing to listen to anyone who is not an insider and cheerleader for the current policy the county might not be in the current situation.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|i bought his first and his second and his cd/dvd and this and that but this album is a bit of a dissapointment to me.<br /><br />it's way too predictable,it's like they were afraid to take any chance and just leave things as they were,witch is boring i guess,i love the americain songbook but i really think most versions of the swingtracks he did are lifeless.<br /><br />i like<br /><br />-it had better be tonight<br /><br />-me and mrs jones<br /><br />-lost<br /><br />-i've got the world on a string<br /><br />-i'm your man<br /><br />-comin'home<br /><br />they are pretty decent versions not allway new and exiting but they are good but the rest of the album is uninspiring i think,everything sounds a bit too poppy for my taste nice song but that's it,as for the other interpretations,well they lack that certain something,i can't explain but overall this album doesn't exite me as his first did,it sounds just like i expected it to sound and that's predictable.his voice is like allways superb that's why i allready ordered tickets to see him live but this cd i'm not crazy about shame,next time michael be really irresponsible!!

B000MTPANQ|5.0|Live at Massey Hall captures the best of Neil Young's solo accoustic accomplishments.  The concert tour was subsequent to \\"After the Goldrush\\" but before \\"Harvest.\\"  Neil elected to play a majority of new compositions from Harvest rather than rely on the commercial success of \\"After the Goldrush.\\"  The audience in Canada openly embraced the performance and Neil responded with an intense performance.  While the video portion is weak and even absent at times the audio accoustics are breathtaking.  Never were Neil's vocals stronger as his voice resonated throughout Massey Hall. <br /> <br />This is solo guitar aned piano music; no feedback guitar and screaming rock and roll.  It is personal music with thought and emotions that can move the heart.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. <br /> <br />Jim Musec
B00005JPFF|4.0|*Possible spoilers within.*    Though Bryan Singer's \\"[[ASIN:B000078UJV X-Men]],\\" released in 2000, revived audiences' dormant interest in the superhero film, it was Sam Raimi's \\"[[ASIN:B00005JKCH Spider-Man]],\\" released two years later, that renewed their fascination with it.  \\"Spider-Man\\" was exactly the kind of superhero film moviegoers wanted to see: lighthearted, humorous, over-the-top but still grounded in reality, action-packed but still clever.  After the huge box office success of that film, a sequel was inevitable, and so in 2004 we received \\"[[ASIN:B00005JMQW Spider-Man 2]]\\" like a gift from on high.  At the time of its release, \\"Spider-Man 2\\" was hailed as \\"the greatest superhero movie ever made\\" and, more than that, an excellent movie.  Needless to say it was a hard act to follow.  Yet follow it they did, and now, three years later, we have the very highly-anticipated \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" again directed by Sam Raimi.    \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" which makes Raimi the first director ever to direct every movie in a superhero film trilogy, is also the first of the \\"Spider-Man\\" series to feature more than one villain.  Raimi and star Tobey Maguire pushed for the inclusion of the Sandman, portrayed by \\"[[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Sideways]]\\"'s Thomas Haden Church, but the villain for which audiences gave \\"Spider-Man 3\\" the biggest box-office opening of all time is Venom, played by Topher Grace of \\"[[ASIN:B0002PYS5G That '70s Show]].\\"  (Grace actually left the show solely to perform in this film.)  Among fans, Venom is by far the most popular of the \\"Spider-Man\\" villains, despite the fact that he is relatively knew to the comics (the character was introduced in the mid-80s).  He's the result of the combination of sleazy photographer Eddie Brock and a parasitic alien symbiote, which leeches on to Brock and brings out the aggression in him (although not before it's leeched on to Spider-Man himself, the central point of the film).    Despite the fan interest in the character, however, Raimi was originally dead-set against included him in the film, claiming that the character's \\"lack of humanity\\" put him off.  It was producer Avi Arad who suggested Raimi take a closer look at the character (\\"I told him, 'You're not giving the fans what they want,'\\" she says), and take a closer look at he did.  Thus Venom makes his big-screen debut in \\"Spider-Man 3\\" - for roughly 15 minutes.  At the end of the movie.  The good news is that for whatever time he's on-screen, Venom is the center of attention, a deliciously animalistic and vicious creature whose inhumanity and violent tendencies are what make him so fascinating.  He's everything the fans have been waiting so long for.  The bad news is that he's in the film for 15 minutes - before he, the symbiote, and Eddie Brock, the whole lot of 'em, are killed.    But don't blame Spidey for the untimely death of Spider-Man's greatest foe: blame the writers.  The biggest problem with \\"Spidey 3\\" isn't that there's too many problems - it's that there's one problem big enough to nearly destroy the movie.  That problem is the script, authored by Alvin Sargent (who also wrote \\"Spidey 2\\") as well as Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, who also co-wrote Sam's cult legend \\"[[ASIN:B0000844IT Army of Darkness]].\\"  Whether it's because there are too many writers (Sargent did pretty well solo on \\"Spidey\\" no. 2!) or because the film was just rushed (though you'd think three years would be enough time), or just because Sam Raimi had a hard time deciding which villain(s) to use, the script is a mess.  The storyline involving Sandman and Venom feels lopsided, and the story structure feels like it's strewn all over the place.  To top it all off, there's some absurd dialogue, ranging from an enraged Harry Osborne's \\"I protected you in high school, now I'm gonna kick your ass!\\" to a news anchor's cliched \\"Oh, the brutality!\\"      Aside from the film's lame duck of a screenplay, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" has a lot going for it.  For one thing, Tobey Maguire gives one of his sweetest, most likable performances ever, and that's saying something for a consistently-amiable actor like Maguire.  James Franco gives a surprisingly winning performance considering his character's pigheadedness.  And while the rest of the regular cast is as fine as ever, it's the newcomers who steal the show.  For example, Bryce Dallas Howard (of M. Night Shyamalan's \\"[[ASIN:B00064LJVE The Village]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000JLTR8Q Lady in the Water]]\\"), who plays Gwen Stacey (apparently related to her comic book counterpart in name and appearance only), is charming.  Again the script's lopsidedness comes into play, as Howard doesn't have nearly enough screen time.  Thomas Haden Church's Sandman is a sufficiently sympathetic character, but it's Topher Grace who really shines.  Grace's performance is perfectly sleazy and also delectably insidious.  He makes a surprisingly frightening Venom as well, considering his reputation as the thin wisecracker from \\"That 70's Show.\\"  And, for the many fans of Sam Raimi's \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy, Bruce Campbell makes an obligatory (and, naturally, hilarious) cameo as a French maitre d'.    Raimi himself takes a darker approach to directing the film than he did with the first two.  That's perfect, though, because the storylines demand that he do so.  Unfortunately, his approach is also a little too dreary.  Raimi seems to have lost some of his zest.  That's a pity, because his obvious enthusiasm was a big part of what made \\"Spidey 1\\" and \\"2\\" so much fun.  Nevertheless, his talent as a director is still quite clear through many emotional performances and neat camera tricks, as well at least one very memorable and moody panorama.    Speaking of visuals, the film's special effects deserve some mention.  One of the things the film is not lacking in is spectacular fight scenes, and, since \\"Spider-Man 3\\" has the costliest budget in U.S. movie history, those scenes are pretty neat.  Unequestionably the highlight of the effects-laden sequences is the Sandman, whose ominous appearance becomes awe-inspiring through some stellar CGI.  Unfortunately, the great amount of this stellar CGI and the lesser amount of Mr. Thomas Hayden Church reduces the character to a simple visual showcase through most of his time on-screen.  Fortunately, though, one of the few good aspects of the script is a perfect balance between scenes of action and scenes of drama.    One last thing of note: Christopher Young's score.  Young is taking over for the brilliant Danny Elfman, who declined to work on \\"Spidey 3,\\" citing \\"creative differences\\" with Mr. Raimi.  All of Elfman's really memorable score has been reused in the film, so he's not as sorely missed as was when he left the 90's \\"Batman\\" series with Tim Burton.  However, while Elfman would undoubtedly have crafted some very memorable music for the Sandman and particularly for Venom, Young's themes, like the rest of his score, are instantly forgettable and just plain uninspired.      In the end, how much you enjoy \\"Spider-Man 3\\" depends on how much its faults bother you, and whether or not you can accept it for what it is.  What it is is a great superhero movie and a worthy installment in the \\"Spidey\\" saga, despite a few nearly fatal flaws.  And while comic book aficionados will have a bone or two to pick with Mr. Raimi, any moviegoer who enjoyed the previous adventures of Spider-Man should find \\"Spider-Man 3\\" a dandy way to entertain themselves for a little over two hours.  Though it may get some spider-senses tingling, \\"Spider-Man 4\\" is planned for a 2009 release, and regardless of whether you enjoyed \\"Spidey 3,\\" there's little doubt that audiences will still web-sling their way to see more adventures of the amazing Spider-Man.

Zeus, Poseidon and Hades are having a little disagreement about the theft of the said lightning bolt, and unless Percy can retrieve it and return it in time, the resulting fallout will have earth-shattering consequences.<br /><br />This great (albeit relatively unknown) first book of the series is an easy read, and is sure to encourage young readers to improve their knowledge of Greek mythology, especially the stories of the Minotaur, Medusa and the gods Poseidon, Ares, Zeus, Hades, Kronos, Athena and so on. Highly recommended for young readers in search of an original and imaginative adventure series.<br /><br />Amanda Richards

0800141660|5.0|GREAT movie, second only to the PBS version of Pride & Prejudice.  Emma Thompson is, of course, fabulous, and Hugh Grant does a terrific job as her love interest. <br /> <br />It's a classic Jane Austen tale about love outside class boundaries and the inequities of women in 18th century England who can't inherit. <br /> <br />Can they surmount the odds against the match?  Will their reticence in speaking openly keep them forever misunderstanding each other?  Can one sister become less romantically blinded by love, and the other become a little MORE so? <br /> <br />Well worth the watch.
0345494768|5.0|Incredible indepth \\"inside\\" information on the legendary film. George Lucas' vision is told very clearly here- you will get a real sense of what he was struggling to make and how he got there. No fan of the film will want to miss this. A time capsule of moviemaking and culture of the mid-seventies. The detail of production dealing from artistic vision to day-to-day realities of getting in the trenches to film under difficult circumstances is both mind-boggling and so facinating. The film came together to be a world-wide success not by accident. Hard work and artistic brillance was rule of thumb in this cinematic universe. You will come away deeply impressed. This book should be a film school staple textbook if it isn't already! Worth it's weight in gold...
1400031362|5.0|This is another wonderful slow amble through Botswana, but do not be deceived, badness is like a Mamba snake in the brush, waiting to catch you unawares. Pretty faces can hide bad thoughts and even worse morals. Or a total lack of morals. Even on the African plain where life should be serene it is not so, a brother is being poisoned and there is much unhappiness and suspicion in the household. A lost boy child smelling of lion turns up in the middle of a safari hunting party, so is given over to the orphan farm, where he will be coaxed back to health. With a little help from Mr.J.L.B. Matekoni, who also needs some nursing as he suffering from depression. So the two help each other.<br /><br />Back in town beauty queens turn out to have feet of clay and to cap it all the fiance of Mma Ramotswe is turning his back on his beloved engines. Hence his rest cure out at the orphan farm. But the business cannot run itself, what if those useless boys take a hammer to an engine again? What would happen to the reputation of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors?<br /><br />Action is required all round and the ladies of The No.1 Detective Agency don't fail us.<br /><br />This is not the book to read if you like fast-paced thrillers, this is more Miss Marple but instead of Darjeeling she is sipping her cup of red bush tea on the veranda of Zebra Drive thinking about how the daddy, that fine judge of cattle would have solved these manifold problems.<br /><br />I love each and everyone of these books and I commend them to you all for some much needed calm and peace in a bustling world.

0143036556|5.0|I have been a fan of Jared Diamond for years and Collapse cements him in my mind as one of the most important thinkers of our times.    Where in Guns, Germs and Steel Diamond addressed the question why did some societies \\"succeed\\" in the sense of technological and imperial advancement while other societies remained firmly at a hunter gatherer or pastoral level, in Collapse he addresses why some societies fail and the implication of these findings on modern societies,.         Diamond starts by reviewing the environmental issues which are currently affecting a Montana a state to which he is a regular visitor. From this starting point, he then looks back into history to review why a selection of  previous societies including Easter Island, the Maya and the Greenland Norse failed, identifying five major reasons including environmental damage inflicted by the society, climate changes, failure to correct faulty cultural practices, loss of advantageous arrangements with trade partners and conflict with neighbours.  After investigating reasons why societies fail, Diamond then looks at societies which have succeeded in addressing the environmental issues which have confronted them and highlights there ability to plan in the long term, to be flexible to address issues as they arise and to actively drive change either from a popular bottom up or politically inspired and enforced top down basis.    And then in finally in the last third of Collapse, Diamond applies these lessons to the modern world first highlighting countries and regions which are currently facing immediate serious environmental and the impact that this has had upon those countries including the genocide in Rwanda which he argues was at least partly driven by population growth and its impact on limited land resources. Of personal impact this section included a critique on my home of Australia which highlights the immense damage which has been afflicted environmentally (and continues to inflicted) due to a lackof understanding of the country and the attempts to apply European farming techniques and culture to a uniquely non European land.     Finally, Diamond on a grander scale details the environmental issues which are facing the world in general and issues a call to action to act both personally and via political influence to address or reverse these changes. Diamond states that ultimately he is cautiously optimistic that we will act in time to head-off the failure of the global civilization which we have built. I wished that I could find his optimism.     Collapse should be required reading for all politicians and frankly for all members of society
B000LC55F2|4.0|This was a more than decent big budget Hollywood film.  The film struggled with a fundamental problem:  in a film about magicians, you know from the outset that it is going to be a succession of surprises and that nothing is going to turn out to be what it seems.  So, one would have to be a pretty inexperienced filmgoer not to anticipate most or all of the surprises at the end.  I actually figured out the Hugh Jackman side of the surprises pretty early in the film and the Christian Bale side just short of the very end.  So the film suffers from being a film that needs to surprise you to be completely successful, but telegraphing at least 50% of the surprises.<br /><br />What we are left with is a film about revenge and duplicity.  I won't go into the later since it leads to spoilers, but I will say that I rarely if ever enjoy revenge as a major theme in a film.  Two major period films dealing with magicians were released at approximately the same time:  THE PRESTIGE and THE ILLUSIONIST.  I personally enjoyed the latter more than THE PRESTIGE simply because while it also contained a revenge element, it also focused on the possibility of uniting separated lovers.  No such uplifting theme accompanies THE PRESTIGE.  In short, I found it to be something of a downer.  Albeit a highly entertaining downer.<br /><br />Despite these objections I am glad I saw the film.  There is a wonderful period feel to the entire thing and it looked great from beginning to end.  And you can't find a much stronger cast than this one.  Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were superb in their roles at the heart of the picture.  Jackman plays the less gifted magician of the two, but one far more gifted with stage flair and presentation than the rather wooden Bale character.  Michael Caine, who teamed with both Nolan and Bale in BATMAN BEGINS, is as welcome as always.  Scarlet Johansson is certainly a lovely woman, but I would prefer to have seen the highly underrated and under used Piper Perabo in her role (why is Ms. Perabo not a superstar?).  Still, it was nice to see Perabo in a decent role in a major film, playing Jackman's wife early in the film.  David Bowie was effective playing eccentric genius Tesla, though made up in a way to resemble Edward Fox.  Voice over artist Andy Serkis (Golum in the LORD OF THE RING series) plays Tesla's assistant.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the film and I imagine that those not so intent as I was to figure out what the future twists in the film might it enjoy it a lot more than I did.r Perabo in her role (why is Ms. Perabo not a superstar?).

B00005JPFH|5.0|If I had listened to all of the unbelievable negative reviews, I would never have seen what I consider to be not only the best movie in the Spiderman series, but the best superhero movie ever!  <br /> <br />The acting was superb, as was the amazingly touching story, and the special effects were some of the best I have seen in any movie. It was well paced, with a good balance of character drama, suspense, action, emotion, comedy, and even suprising moral lessons about the damage inflicted by hate and revenge, and the redemption of true love and fogiveness.  <br /> <br />I have never written a review for a film in my life but after reading all of the negative reviews written by critics, I thought this review might make a difference for someone debating on whether or not to see this movie. Needless to say, I loved this film; and according to countless reviews on this site, there are many who feel the same. If you see this film you will not be disapointed. Forget all the negative things the critics have to say. If you ask me, their taste is all in their mouth.
B000MGBSI0|4.0|Watching these many years after the show first came out is a lot of fun; the first season was somewhat of a snoozer, but with Kimberly and Sydney on hand, season 2 becomes much more entertaining and campy. If you want great acting and credible storylines, Melrose Place is not for you. If you're looking for cotton candy entertainment and great zingers, well, it doesn't get better than Amanda (Heather Locklear) and crew. Have to comment on the DVD's themselves; Paramount didn't go to too much trouble in giving a high quality picture; the source looks like a VHS tape, and it was somewhat disappointing to read on the liner notes that episodes had been edited and the music changed. Looks like Paramount went on the cheap for this one.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|This is a comprehensive collection of Matrix material intended for those interested in the entire breadth and depth of this artistic statement. Too often the Matrix collection is judged on the basis of the first film, which is an outstanding entertainment, but not the complete story in either content or artistic intent.  <br /> <br />The most valuable additions this collection contains are the contrasting commentaries. One commentary is done by three film critics who give a review of the films from a view that generally doesn't see the deeper philosophical, theological, and intellectual elements of the full story. The other commentary is that of two philosophers who examine their interpretations of the deeper levels of the Matrix. This is an outstanding extra. The brothers have avoided giving their own interpretation of the story, and when asked to do a commentary for this collection, they came up with this unique set of contrasting viewpoints. It is invaluable if you are interested in the multiple interpretations of the Matrix. <br /> <br />Also included are the Animatrix shorts which fill in some of the pre-Matrix story. Most film is entertainment (often poor), but a few films rise to the level of art. If you have any doubts that the Matrix story is a work of art  rich with multiple levels of interpretation, this collection will lay that to rest.

B000FS9MZQ|5.0|These are the single-disc widescreen editions of films that, in my humble opinion, should have won the Oscar for Best Picture of their respective release years.  Both films are unusual and thoughtful love stories that will stay in your heart and your head for some time after you see them.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is about two mismatched people who both need each other and hurt each other to the point that each has their minds erased by a company that provides such a service - Lacuna Inc. In spite of this, they wind up meeting and starting the relationship all over again. The film has a lot to say about how we are the product of our memories and our choices - both the bad and the good. It also illustrates how absolute power corrupts through the unconsciable actions of some of the employees of Lacuna Inc. who start out helping people and end up helping themselves.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" doesn't have even the bittersweet ending of \\"Eternal Sunshine\\". Two people who might have had a lifetime of happiness together - Ennis and Jack - stay apart because the society in which they live and the time in which they live doesn't give them any other options. Instead they have only stolen moments together several times a year over a twenty year period, and they and everyone close to them suffers because of the lie they both live. Only the rules of society end up satisfied in this film.

A very good selection of material and out of all the tracks there were only maybe 2 that I did not particularly care for the arrangement(s), but I would still recommend purchasing this CD. <br />It is one of which I will never tire of listening (and enjoying). Tip of the hat to Ringo for forging on with the project when there was probably not a lot of encouragement. He did well.

B000JSI7AI|5.0|This film is about love lost for the sake of keeping up appearances that, in the end, just makes everyone involved miserable. Ennis and Jack are two young men who spend the summer of 1963 herding sheep in Wyoming on an isolated mountain in Wyoming. Ennis is the strong silent type in the Gary Cooper tradition, while Jack is more outgoing. During the two months they are together they become friends and then lovers. Had the time and place been different, they would have probably stayed together, based on the powerful scene in which they go their separate ways after that first summer. However, with the culture being that of the rugged mountain west and the time that of the early sixties, this was an impossibility. The reaction of their boss and Ennis' wife when they discover what is going on tells you what they could have looked forward to if they had been open about their relationship - muted ostracism by daylight, perhaps violence come nightfall. At first, the two just try to put their feelings for each other behind them. Ennis, already engaged, goes through with his marriage as planned and fathers two daughters. Jack goes back to Texas, meets and marries the daughter of a wealthy farm equipment dealer, and fathers a son. Four years after their initial separation, Jack returns to Wyoming and their relationship picks up where it left off - still a secret, this time on the pretext of week-long \\"fishing trips\\" they take two or three times a year for the next fifteen years, never able to tell anyone about their love, never able to show their affection in public. Many have mentioned that the two were just cheating on their wives all of this time, but the fact is if they had been able to follow their hearts, they would have never had wives to begin with.<br /><br />Much of what is great about this film is what is left unsaid. Is Ennis actually homosexual or did he just fall in love with someone who happened to be a man? Did Jack die the way his wife said he did or he way Ennis imagined? Did Jack lie to Ennis that last time they were together and say he was having an affair with a woman because he knew Ennis would be jealous of another man but not another woman? Did Jack deliberately take Ennis' shirt as a reminder of him that first summer or did he just find it and decide to keep it? The acting is tremendous, and I find myself mourning the tragedy of the characters in this film as though they were real people, although I'm sure their situation represents many real ones past and present. This is a beautiful and thoughtful film that definitely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. Jack and Ennis' double lives just leave themselves, their wives, and everyone else who is close to them feeling empty and just add up to time and opportunity lost. Only the unwritten rules of society and conformity come out the winner in this one.Ennis imagined?

I recommend this album to anyone that enjoys great rock with a splash of progressive. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it can leave you feeling gray and flat after a few listens. Definitely something you don't want to put into your regular rotation or play at a party when you're trying to pump things up.

George's son plays the throughout most of the consert.  He looks so much like his Dad.<br /><br />It's like a two for one concert.  You can have some great Indian music for dinner, then for an upbeat party atmosphere play the George music.

B000NVIXFK|2.0|I'm going to say what many others have posted here before me: I've been a huge fan of this band since the early '90s and have eagerly anticipated each release since. I can't really say which one album I like most; as Rush changed their sound and approach throughout the years, I came to appreciate them all in their own way. From the hard rock sound of the mid'70s, prog rock of the late '70s, cleaner more approchable early '80s rock, the synth period of the mid to late '80s, the pop-rock 'Presto' and 'Roll The Bones', back to basics 'Counterparts' and 'Test For Echo' and the hard rockin' but controversial only because of the harsh production 'Vapor Trails', every one of these records has a place in my heart. That being said, I really can't get into 'Snakes and Arrows' and I doubt that I ever will. 'Far Cry' is a decent song. 'Spindrift' has a slightly evil sounding riff and dark mood. 'Armour and Sword' has a nice catchphase for a chorus. But the whole of the album just has a sameness to it due to the overabundance of midtempo songs, indulgant forgettable too-wordy lyrics, total and complete lack of good hooks or melodies and too many layers of guitars and vocals. I swear, it's like they recorded one song and just crammed in Neil's unusually whiny lyrics over the top every time. Why does Geddy have to do the same lazy phrasing that he's been doing the last couple of albums and stretch out the last word in every line of every song? And out of the three instrumentals, only 'Malignant Narcissism' holds my attention, sort of. 'Hope' sounds like someone recorded Alex toying with an acoustic in the studio and 'Main Monkey Business' sounds like an outtake from 1996's 'Victor'.  <br /> <br />I can't tell you how much this hurts me to slam this album and my musical heros, but 'Snakes and Arrows' is just not up to par. Even the cover art is a let down. They should have used the carrage/lightning pic on the inside of the album for the front. The reviews that enthusiasically claim this to remind them of 'Hemispheres' and other '70s albums are nuts, this sounds NOTHING like their old work. The production is fine, but the songs are just lacking anything interesting. Here's hoping that the upcoming tour will change my mind about some of the songs after I hear them live.

B00000JXZ7|4.0|This review is in response to gripes by the aforementioned reviewer regarding the \\"excessive\\" dynamic range on this CD. <br /> <br />Sound engineers do not purposely \\"exaggerate\\" dynamic range on discs - in fact, if you were familiar with modern sound engineering, you would know that a prevalent problem nowadays is the *reduction* of dynamic range (compression) in order to win the \\"loudness race\\". I do not know of a single disc out there that had its dynamic range artificially \\"expanded\\", if this is even possible. <br /> <br />In other words, your playback equipment is to fault - it is (sadly) typical for lower end audio equipment to not reproduce low level information well; it vanishes, making fortissimos startling and pianissimos absent. Or perhaps you are listening to this disc in a noisy environment, with low level information getting lost in the haze of environmental noise. <br /> <br />Regardless of the reason, I feel that your opinion on this disc's sound quality should be taken with more than a small pinch of salt given the information that I have relayed here.
B00065EB2M|3.0|This set contains a lot of TV footage, and not much 16mm film footage.

The video is full 30 FPS, but it has \\"muddy\\" pictures.<br /><br />The audio is sometimes incomprehensible.  I had thought this was going to be a professionally digitized product, and I guess my expectations were too high.

B000J4QWMC|2.0|Is it me or is Colin Farrell overrated? He's not a fire breathing tough guy and he doesn't look weathered enough to be an undercover narcotics agent. And except for his Ray performance, Jamie Foxx always seems comical. I don't know if it's his facial expressions or what, but I have hard time believing Jamie Foxx as a bad guy. Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest, the movie did have some redeeming qualities. Michael Mann movies always seem to have an amazing color palate. And the special features portion is well developed. Unfortunately, the plot didn't live up to the hype. Since when do White Supremacist deal with Colombians and vice-versa? And since when do drug dealers take hostages; especially without killing them? How come Crockett and Tubbs never get made as cops? I really wanted to give this film three stars, but I can't. The movie oozes with the seedy, sleazy, sexually charged and fashionably raunchy environment that only Miami can offer. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't work because the stars of the show seem out of place and not well cast.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|The music is beautiful; it either is or seems to be, some ancient, wonderfully mystical stuff. We saw (and heard) Ms. McKinnit on public television and I looked up the CD on Amazon, something I do often.

B000O1799U|2.0|Dreamgirls, One of the Best Musicals ever comes to the big screen and like many I was looking forward to seeing one of my all time favorites shine. Regrettably this is not the case. I will credit the actors hired for this. They were given a less then great script to work with. That said, I feel that Effie was not nearly powerful enough. I know that it would take alot to fill the shoes of Jennifer Holiday and in the movie this shows. I cannot help but think the actress was stifled by the very even leveled volume thru the dvd. I have tried listening thru home theatre at a decent volume but when Effie was belting ( or lack there of) her soul I didn't notice any difference in volume. This should have blasted at that point. Further the camera angles were very odd. Why the pan in and out at odd times was ever chosen that way I don't know other than they take away from the scene at hand. Also the fluff added to make this longer was so so at best. It could have happened yes, but I feel it strayed away from the original far too much. Also the fact that numbers were moved around didn't help. I tried really hard to watch this and keep in mind that it was not the original and tried to view it in its own light, however I could not find that place. Bottom line is this, Some Broadway shows should never be redone on the big screen and this is one of those. If you were fortunate enough to see the original you will know what I mean. Again the actors they hired are not to blame for this lousy attempt at bringing a cherished play to the big screen,the attempts to tie this to Diana Ross and the Supremes were too blatant ( the unspoken was this was based on the struggle they had making to the top) and rent the dvd. I know that I wont be buying it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well here it is fans..the complete series. I defy any Browncoat to start this without stopping . I promise you wont be able to stop until you have done watching the whole series and by then you will have ordrered the movie ! All your favorites are here Mal, Kaylee (sigh),Wash ,Jayne,et al giving the performances that have made them the biggest science fiction cult since the trekkies. Besides the amazing technical prowess of the production there are clever scripts great stories and just some downright emotional moments as the tales of the future echo the real world of today. If you have somehow lived deprived of this amazing series I can just about guarantee you'll be happy and if you have not seen all the episodes your hunger for more Firefly will be satisfied...can't stop the signal right ??

B00005JLKB|5.0|I had never seen this while it was running, and happened to come across some re-runs. I got the entire series after that. A great series with characters that you enjoy watching - for the story lines and for the acting. They are all pretty easy on the eyes too.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|I returned this item.  I ordered the wrong version.  Please refer to my other order...\\"Full Screen\\" version for the review for this movie.
B000J10ERO|2.0|Just couldn't compare to Smallville or even the first Superman. Mildly interesting story line, but basically ho hum. Brandon Routh suffers by comparison both to Christopher Reeves and to Tom Welling. What was the point of making this movie?
B000JBWWRY|5.0|The little one LOVES it over and over again!!!  So much more vibrance than the VHS version!!!  Which we have too.  Amazon shipped very quickly...thanks!!!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Very gritty and exciting, this is the best Bond since Sean Connery's Bond films. Unlike recent films in the series, \\"Casino Royale\\" bears some faint resemblance to the Ian Fleming book of the same name, and the characters are recognizable from the book as well. Highly recommended for fans of the book and of the film series.
B00005JPFH|4.0|Spoilers!<br /><br />I thought it was pretty good while watching it and then after it was over, several things began to bother me.<br /><br />If one is going to have Harry die at the end, why not have him just die after the ally fight? It would be great seeing Peter have to fight Sandman with that guilt on his shoulders too.<br /><br />So Sandman is just going to fly around for the rest of his life and rip people off and Spiderman is okay with that at the end?<br /><br />Why have Harry make Mary Jane break up with Peter if that was never going to come back into play at the end with Harry saying, \\"I'm sorry,\\" and Mary Jane confessing what had happened. I mean they were so giddy to talk about their feelings throughout, why stop there?<br /><br />I think it would have been better to have Harry find a way to make Peter break up with Mary Jane so Peter would have that hanging on his shoulders too.<br /><br />Also at the end, since Eddie/Venom is pissed that Peter \\"stole\\" his girl (actually Eddie and Gwen only had one date briefly mentioned in a throwaway bit of dialogue so they weren't actually going out) why not have both Mary Jane and Gwen hanging from the rooftops at the end so Peter would really have to make a choice and Mary Jane would be shown that Peter truly loves her.<br /><br />And yes, Venom is handled so fast, so abruptly that one is left with wondering why he is in the movie at all. I mean there are other characters in this series who are supposed to turn into villians too but they haven't so far, so it would been better to just have Eddie in this film and transform him in a later film.<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained but this is the weakest in the series so far as a film.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is by far the best Bond.  It let's you in on the few key secrets to who James Bond is.  It shows an early stage in the development of Bond, a stage when mistakes happen and are corrected.   <br /> <br />It's not an easy film.  Bond is hard and complex, flawed and as human as anyone with a \\"license to kill\\" can be.  It is also not for those of a weak nature.  This Bond takes damage and expects you to feel it, too. <br /> <br />If you ready for a hard look at a super-assassin-spy then this is the film.  If you are ready for a hard look at James Bond then this is the film.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|In the cinema, it was thrilling to see the Bond franchise come back from its addled, paunchy blockbuster cycle with an actual story, characters that were as fun to watch as their stunt doubles, and set-pieces that came at you like a shock treatment cure for CGI. (I hope the cast and crew all held hands in a circle every night and thanked Paul Greengrass for scaring their producers straight - or almost straight.) <br />For me, it's the relative lack of CGI - and that 'processed food' feel of synthetic epics - that makes it such a great candidate for a Blu-ray to buy. Boy, do you see and hear and feel what you're getting. The extra clarity and and detail really did make me feel more of the crackle, mischief and grit, as well as the gut-punches and 'holy ... that really is for real!' moments.  <br />Other little details make me happy, too. The bonus features don't send you back into little 4:3 blurry boxes that have you fiddling with aspect ratios - they look and sound like nice little films, for the most part. (One of them also reminds you that, yes, maybe the 20 minutes they should have cut out was the relapse into dumb-blockbuster-itis that had them building the Biggest Ever Sinking Venetian Building on Gimballs for no particular reason.) <br />And an annoying detail of watching movies on the PS3 is that you really do have to buy the bluetooth remote. No IR, or even RF, works. And the gamepad is a horribly frustrating way to navigate PS3's peculiar menu naviagation. You'll be happier if you get the extra remote, I'm afraid.[[ASIN:B000M17AVO Sony Playstation 3 Blu-Ray DVD Remote]] <br />PS: to make the interactive experience more complete, it's well worth following the advice of the UK film critic, Mark Kermode, and having the room yell, \\"Ker-ching!\\" at the excruciatingly ham-fisted product placement moment when Vesper says 'nice watch - Rolex?' 'Omega' replies Daniel Craig (because no, we have been yanked out of our suspension of disbelief by that little exercise incrassness and audience contempt, so he's not James Bond). Of course, it could explain why having his other bits of dignity swung at didn't faze him later.
B00003OSTN|5.0|She is downtrodden and hammy in this overly dramatic movie.  What can I say...I loved every minute of it.
1400097029|4.0|The negative reviews of Banville's novel make a point of the book being all fluff and no stuff, which is probably warranted.  If you're looking for an easy page-turner sort of read, then you will probably dislike this work.  Banville is no story-crafter, he's a story-writer.  There is a difference.  If you do not appreciate good writing at the expense of plot, it is only fitting that you would not enjoy reading The Sea.  But, if we were to consider this in terms of art, then there is really nothing wrong with Banville's method of writing.  It's just a matter of style compensating for what a typical reader would consider \\"substance.\\"  Picasso or Matisse's appeal was in their style more than anything else.  While I am not making any sort of comparison there, I simply believe that there is merit in an author's style as much as there is in his ability to construct an engaging plot.  Someone previously mentioned Nabokov, and I believe the comparison is apt.  Find some joy in the singer's voice as opposed to the lyrics he or she is singing.  While not the best book (stylistically or plot-wise), it is a worthy demonstration of a terrific writer.
0374105235|5.0|For a first-time author, this is a remarkable effort. It is a tragic and compelling story of the loss of childhood and family in a war-ravaged society. The author tells his story in a straightforward and unsentimental way. His writing is often lyrical in descriptions of natural surroundings as he viewed his world. Despite the horrors he describes in which he was both victim and victimizer, you cannot stop reading, nor can you condemn. A must read for anyone who is enamored of the glory of war - it tells of the true cost for  the active participant, the innocents caught in the cross-fire, and the greater society.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|It's getting difficult to find good films nowadays and I can say that Batman Begins is an unpolished gem. It has several things that were missing from the previous films allowing this to be a complete story. It's all right to keep Tim Burton's films for good artistic expression and value, but if you want to look at a more character driven piece, then this is it. <br /> <br />In Batman Begins we delve into the psychological or zen like as well as the physical shaping of Batman. Bruce Wayne goes from a frightened child to an angry collegian whose rage must be focused into fighting injustice. Recieving the \\"Superman\\" treatment, this film has a delightful cast (Holmes being the only exception) that gives rousing performances all around. The blend of action and humor is there. In addition, the story is well rounded and interesting, leaving everyone to wonder about the upcoming sequel. The only thing that can stop Batman now is Warner Brothers. In retrospect, let's see if Christopher Nolan has time to direct a Superman film as well.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|As just an action movie, I might have rated Casino Royale higher.  Casino Royale, however, isn't just an action movie, it's a Bond movie.  Therefore my expectations are much higher and my rating much lower.<br /><br />The Bond movie that I found Casino Royale most comparable to was On Her Majestry's Secret Service.  In both movies Bond fell in love and had his heart broken when the women he fell for died at the end.<br /><br />In this comparison, I'm almost tempted to give On Her Majestry's Secret Service the edge.  Casino Royale was arguably a better action movie but I feel that On Her Majestry's Secret Service had more of the key ingredients that make a Bond movie a Bond movie, in spite of Bond getting married in it.<br /><br />The ingredients that I felt were lacking in Casino Royale were Bond's charm, humor, gadgets and, to be blunt, scantly clad women.  All three were sorely missed, especially the scantly clad women during the opening credits.  I think the movie would have been helped by John Cleese's return as R to give the movie both more humor and more gadgets.<br /><br />I understand that Casino Royale called or an edgier Bond but I find it hard to believe that Bond had to lose his charm in the process.  I don't know whether that was because of the script, the directing or Daniel Craig's acting.  I suspect that it was a combination of the three.<br /><br />I think the Bond enterprise will benefit by turning to Hugh Jackman when they decide to bring Bond's charm back.  It won't be the first time an Aussie played Bond (George Lazenby in On Her Majestry's Secret Service) and I think Hugh Jackman will return to James Bond the much needed charm that Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Bronson brought to the role.  In Casino Royale, I felt that charm was sorely missing.
055358202X|4.0|I've read a number of the other reviews of this book and must admit, I don't agree.  While many argue that this book wasn't as strong as the others in the series, because it was only \\"half\\" a book, I must say that I did really enjoy it. <br /> <br />Is it the best in the series?  No.  But does it do a great job at moving along a number of elements of the story.  Absolutely.  And it also kept me engrossed.  I was enjoying reading about events from Jaime's point of view, getting more insight into the Kingslayer and his quest for redemption.  I don't know whether he'll achieve it (based on twists that Martin has provided in the past, I'll predict not).  I also enjoyed, kind of like watching a train wreck, reading as Cersie makes blunder after blunder, misunderstanding how to rule. <br /> <br />I found the other characters stories also engrossing. <br /> <br />Would I have liked to have more on Jon, Bran, Tyrion and the others?  Sure.  But I was very satisfied with what was in the book, and it has left me waiting and wanting for the next chapter in this story. <br /> <br />Good job.  Good series.  Still strong.  Still well worth the time in reading.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|How i can describe this? <br />I will put my impressions in simple words: Nausicaa is one of the best <br />anime movies ever made, and i must note that is one of the best movies <br />in science fiction too, his level of excelence are not only restricted <br />to the world of animation.  Simple one \\"must see\\" movie.

B00064VR0W|5.0|This Rod Stewart concert at Royal Albert Hall has to be one of his best performances I've seen.  There were no aspects of the show that I did not totally enjoy.  You felt like you were sitting up front in the audience!
B000J103YI|4.0|This is a superb soundtrack, although I wished I had realized that there was also a 2-CD version...I would have purchased that instead of the single disc version. Though there are a few tracks that don't really shine for me (Steppin' to the Bad Side, Cadillac Car) I think its probably a matter of personal preference...I'm sure there are people who really love those tracks. That said, the best tracks on the album are \\"Love You I Do\\", \\"Dreamgirls\\",\\"Patience\\", \\"I Am Changing\\", \\"One Night Only\\" (both versions), \\"Listen\\" (a new addition to the score, and its fantastic!), \\"Hard to Say Goodbye\\", and the too-short but sweet finale \\"Dreamgirls\\" reprise.    I ommited mentioning Jennifer Hudson's \\"And I am Telling You I'm Not Going\\", only because I want to comment on this notion people have that Jennifer's performance here is bad. First, let me say I never watched American Idol, had no idea who Ms. Hudson was, had never heard her sing before, and was certainly not an established fan. That said, I take extreme issue with the review (and any others like it) in which the reviewer said they were familiar with the original cast recording with the fabulous Jennifer Holiday and that Ms. Hudson's performance was so bad they had to turn it off.  This is ridiculous, and totally destroy's this reviewer's credibility as far as I'm concerned.  I'm 40 years old, own the original cast recording, and although one could certainly claim that Ms. Hudson's performance isn't as good as Jennifer Holiday's (though I actually like both equally...they are just different, apples and oranges, so to speak) it is completely obvious that Ms. Hudson's performance is in no conceivable way BAD.  You can argue that it suffers in comparison to Jennifer Holiday's performance, but you cannot intelligently claim that it is so bad as to be unlistenable.  Shame on you.  Ms. Hudson's performance is perhaps not quite as \\"frantic\\" as Jennifer Holiday's, but I think its a refreshing take.  I think some people just wanted Ms. Hudson to mimic Jennifer Holiday's performance note for note, ad-lib for ad-lib, which is not being a singer...its being a vocal xerox machine.    People, don't listen to the nay-sayers.  Jennifer Hudson is fabulous here. I look forward to seeing what she does in the future.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is first-rate entertainment for kids--and adults, too! At first, the idea of cars talking was a little off-putting to me; but if you can accept the idea that cars can be animated, taking the place of people and all other living creatures in their world, then you can appreciate the hilarity of the jokes, double-entendres, and the universality of a story about a young punk \\"kid\\" who learns how to grow up and slow down, while at the same time bringing an old \\"man\\" out of hermitage and hiding. This is a story of growth and change, with a good dose of innocent comedy (supplied by the character Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) a touch of romance, and a bit of history. Non-Nascar fanatics like myself can still appreciate this new notch in Pixar's belt. Highly recommended.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|It was spectacular when it was released -- even more so now that my tastes have matured and my artistic appreciation has finally been realized.  When  I viewed it for the first time, I think I loved it for its social black/white, Russia/American message and the fact that races and nationalities can come together for a common purpose.  I still love it for that but now, to see these two great dancers together, in their individual forms of dance, takes my breath away.  This is truly a great film!  The special features are so well done, giving a brief & glorious look at Moscow as it was when Baryshnikov danced there.  This film is a fitting & lasting tribute to the talent of America's own Gregory Hines.  I am saddened that he was called away from us so soon -- he is missed!  \\"White Nights\\"is right on top (sharing first with \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\") of my list of the 800+ movies & documentaries I own.  Take my adice -- buy it, cherish it and -- don't lend it to even your best friend. I promise you -- you'll have a difficult time getting it back!  Make your friends buy their own -- they'll love you for it!
0465043577|4.0|I bought this book for a presentation for a course on chaos theory. I read the book, hoping to find some way of tying economics and chaos theory together. Mandelbrot did not disappoint. He carefully explained the flaws in modern financial theory, the research that he had done, and his final model of markets. From this standpoint, the book was very interesting and educational. <br /> <br />It was, however, not for those with little to no mathematical or economical background. Mandelbrot made it understandable, but there were times where it was obvious that someone with no experience in the field would not understand. It is a good book for those interested in understanding financial markets and applications of chaos theory. <br /> <br />My only wish is that Mandelbrot had explained how he made his multifractal model more than what he did. The \\"binomial bending of time\\" was the foundation for why his model worked over all the others, but he devoted less than a page explaining it. Aside from that, it was informative and intriguing, and presented some ideas for further research. It was, all things considered, a good buy.
B0009Q0F5U|4.0|If you're a Battlestar Galatica Fan, this audio is an excellent companion to your collection. Passacaglia, Forgiven, and The Shape of Things to Come are emotional and addictive orchestral soundtracks. Not every song from the first season is included in this CD. The opening credit songs for the UK and the US versions and the battle songs (The Thousandth Landing, Battle on the Asteroid) are included. Battlestar Muzaktica is quite odd and doesn't fit with the collection of songs.

It describes how \\"agnosticism\\" is really a copout and systematiclly deals with all of the so-called proofs of god's existance.

0141184272|5.0|I read Orlando because someone told me that a central theme was Knole, the massive great house of the Sackvilles in Sevenoaks, in Kent south west of London.  (I also liked Mrs Dalloway--See my Amazon review.)  When we lived in London my family and I spent a day at Knole.  It is supposedly the largest private house in England.  Much of it now belongs to the National Trust.  Knole beggars description--it is a vast mansion, brooding, and dark, but also eminent; it is a castle, a factory, mills, breweries, a village, and menagerie.  I remember the deer as being especially numerous and friendly.  Orlando the novel is dedicated to Vita Sackville-West who sadly was unable to inherit Knole although she grew up there.  Only males could inherit.    The novel Orlando is a tour through English history from the mid-15 hundreds to 1928 always from odd perspectives.  It is also a subtle and searching exploration of gender roles, social roles, and artistic and creative efforts.  Themes interweave with lightning speed.  It's crazy, funny, satirical, wild, and moody.  I found parts to be incoherent, post-modern stream-of-consciousness, but most is entertaining and illuminating.    But this novel always comes back to Knole just as Orlando does.  He/she (there is a sex change mid-novel) tours her house, thinks about it, ponders it, worries about it, and is always focused on it.  Orlando lives for hundreds of years, but somehow I think he/she is a metaphor for the great house.  Knole is not mentioned by name in the novel, but that's it.  Knole is also the setting for The Edwardians by Vita Sackville-West.  Knole is very worth a visit if you get to London or Kent.  On the web at the National Trust website.    A visit in person however would help bring the novel Orlando to life.  The novel is titled Orlando: A Biography.  I think it is the biography of Knole.    One other odd feature:  My edition (Signet Classics) has in index.  This is the first novel I've read with an index.  This suggests to me that Orlando is more than a novel, it is also a history of sorts.

B00000GAIW|5.0|What can I say??? One of my fave albums in a short, matter of time.. Just purchased it on cd.I'm not a Tull fanatic,but love a lot of the standard material.I love to dig deep into many artists music.Tull is perfect for this reason.Always listened to the best of over and over and figured,if there was one Tull album to start off with,it would be this one. Really from beginning to end ,it shines greatly.\\"Aqualung\\",\\"Cross-eyed Mary\\",\\"Hymn 43\\" ,\\"Locomotive Breath\\" & \\"Fat Man\\",I was all familiar with.With listening to this album and hearing some at alternate radio,I discovered,\\"Mother Goose\\",\\"Up To Me\\",\\"My God\\",\\"Wind-Up\\" & \\"Songs For Jeffrey\\". Believe me,you can become a Tull fanatic after listening to this one. Buy it,if you are a casual fan or just wanting to hear songs from Tull,that you ordinarily don't hear.Highly recommended .

B000NVIXFK|3.0|This is not the same band that recorded Moving Pictures, Signals, Permanent Waves, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, Presto,and Counterparts. This is an old band who has latched onto an old sound from another old band that is not them.  <br /> <br />If you do not like dark, slow-mid-tempo songs about war, religion, and life sucking than this record is not for you.  <br /> <br />But if you like something different from that old band that has always kept you guessing all along anyway...then there are some good songs for you as well. <br /> <br />In a day and age where rock music and classic rock needs to be supported more than ever I recommend the purchase of this cd. It is far from horrible and it is DIFFERENT. You will not get a Limelight or Tom Sawyer or Subdivisions on this. But you will get some great instrumentals like Hope and Malignant Narcissism. You will get good heartfelt rockers like Faithless and Good News First. You will also get what is already becoming a radio anthem for the band Far Cry. <br /> <br />Personally I do not like the negative tone of the record lyrically and Peart comes off as someone who is just always complaining or shoving his agnostic or atheist beliefs down our ears and throats. There just seems to be a real clear lack of positivity on this album and it melts into the songs one after the other. <br /> <br />I give it 3 stars because it is better than most of the current output from classic rockers and quite simply...is a decent record.
B00028HBL6|5.0|This beautifully directed, acted, and scored film reaffirms Christ's love for His people. Period. Now, there are some liberal agenda-driven detractors who have expressed a misplaced concern about the film, because, as they see it, every time the devil appears on the screen, the hideous creature stands in the midst of some Jews - thus somehow implying the spurious and ugly charge that Jews are evil. But what is not mentioned by the detractors of the film is that the depicted sanctified and saving Christ stands in the midst of Jews, too! And why not? After all, it was Jesus who said, \\"ALL GOOD THINGS COME FROM THE JEWS.\\" The most troubling aspect of this majestic film is not the storyline, but the fact that the film did not win \\"Best Picture.\\" Indeed, the sad fact that the film was shunned by the \\"politically correct\\" Academy Award crowd says more about political cowardice than it does about the imperfect Gibson's perfect masterpiece.

Especially where Stallone talks with his son about \\"expectations\\". A VERY insightful piece of forthright frankness that ALL persons should watch and especially listen too. My only problem was that the DVD took three times the estimated time for arrival from the supplier - NOT GOOD and must be remedied to save your customers

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins is a non-confrontational, non-agrumentative, nearly pure logician.  This book lays out in largely layman terms the case against the existence of god, the absurdity of religion, the utter nonsense of religious \\"leaders\\" like Falwell, Robertson, Dobson, et. al, and makes laughable the intonations of the creationism/intelligent design crowd.  As a scientist, Dawkins debunks every \\"proof\\" of the existence of god - old and new.  His message is not an agrument for atheism, but a scientific, logical, and very persuasive dismanteling of theism and secondarily religion(s) and creationism.  While southern bubbas may be offended by his logic and his conclusions, none seem to be able to refute the cold hard facts;  none seem to be able to present any facts of their own.  A marvelous read, but not for closed minds.
B00005JPAO|4.0|The movie The Queen, starring Helen Mirren is a very good film, and those who like historical period pieces, and also documentaries, should like this film. <br /> <br />The Queen takes place after the election of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the days leading up to and immediately following the death of Princess Diana. <br /> <br />The movie basically gives us a behind-the-scenes view of the royal family at this time.  It does this by intercutting archival video footage with the actors to enable you to follow the story, and give you some sense of why the family reacted the way they did. <br /> <br />Some people say that this movie was more sympathetic to Queen Elizabeth II.  However, I believe that this is just a balanced telling of the story, the director wished to tell.  I believe no judgments can be made.  This movie was another showcase for Helen Mirren, and she deserved the Oscar that she won.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I love Diana Kralls voice and delivery. I listen to this CD when I am on planes and trying to relax and tune out the world...very very nice.
B00005QFE5|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Very moving.  For english speaking viewers, you really must watch it in Chinese and read all subtitles to truly appreciate it.   A movie about love and dedication, not an action movie. Beautiful outdoor scenes.  You wonder why US film makers can't make movies like this.  The movie is slow moving at times, but with a purpose, building true appreciation for the characters.   Liked it so much I have purchased the dvd for family members as gifts.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|The Celtic Woman A new Journey is a great CD.  They blend together really will.  I have their other CD's and this one is equally as great.  Their music is superbly done.
B00005JPCF|4.0|This was one of the cutest movies i watched in a long time. My roommate and i are in Iraq and i watched it just because my son (10) told me that it was a good movie. It made me feel alot better to watch it and understand what he was talking about. It gave me alot more to talk to him about when i called him the next time.
B000J103PC|1.0|I for one hated this movie and it is in pieces in the trash can.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|All I have to say is that this film is a MASTERPIECE!
B00004U28G|4.0|Its a classic, brought back old memories. very funny.. <br />If you haven't seen it you need to add it to our library..
B000E41MS6|5.0|The return of Doctor Who to television was well worth the wait. Christopher Eccles as the ninth incarnation of The Doctor is a refreshing change from the posh and sometimes haughty language of previous doctors. Eccles's Doctor is more down-to-earth in language and approach to the character, making him eminently more approachable.<br /><br />By carving out his own niche and making the character his own, Eccles manages to not only take the show in more fun and interesting directions, but his incarnation does not detract from the actors who previously played the role. Although there are faint echoes of Tom Baker's zany and often mischievous persona, they echoes are very faint indeed. Casting aside the posh accent and adding an element of competence bordering at times on mania, Eccles brings new life into an old favorite and ushers in a new era of intelligent and inventive writing that retains the best (and sometimes hokiest) of the old era.<br /><br />Bravo! And welcome back.
B000JFDBXO|5.0|Ok I can agree on a few things. The added chars did little.  Jeans Rez is part of the comics and i thought it translated pretty well to the movie and added some great Unpredictability.  Personally i thought this was the best of the 3 because you never knew exactly What was going to happen.  I dont want to spoil it for anyone who is going to watch it, but as I said, I think it's the best of the 3 movies.
B000EDWL82|4.0|I love this CD.  It's a great range of high and higher, and I can't wait to hear more from them.
1400032717|3.0|Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone, inspired by his favorite literary character Sherlock Holmes, sets off to solve the mystery of a neighborhood dog's murder. The problem with this is the investigation sends Christopher into the path of strangers. Christopher has listened very carefully to the \\"Stranger Danger\\" lessons at school and knows that strangers are up to no good. As Christopher has recently grown apart from his father, he has to learn to be more independent and to do what he believes is right. I wanted to like this book. I usually like quirky novels, but I felt like Haddon was so focused on portraying Christopher's autism symptoms accurately, that all he (Christopher) was to me was a sum of his quirks, not a person. This novel has pretty good reviews from people who thought it charming and original, so I think I'm in the minority with this opinion. Don't let me discourage you from reading it.
B00005JPP6|4.0|I love Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.  This film was great.  This film had everything from John Woo double slide side shooting Hong Kong film action, to American pyrotechnics and dry British wit.  True to its zombie gangsta roots, it was hysterical.  I'd see it again in a heartbeat.
B000O174CM|4.0|I just finished watching the DVD of \\"Dreamgirls\\" and the movie comes off as a mixed bag.  The scenes between Jennifer Hudsons powerful and heart-tugging perfomrmance seem to stall until she appears on screen again and it was frustrating that many of the numbers were reduced to fragments or heard as background to other scenes being played out Luckily one of the extras on the DVD has twelve of the numbers fully shown.  This includes \\"Steppin' To The Bad Side\\" and it's a shame it was edited for the finished film because the extended version is superior in every way.  It was also nice to have the extended versions of \\"I Am Changing\\" and both the soulful version and disco version of \\"One Night Only. <br /> <br />Pat on the back time-when I reviewed the CD back in December I knew just from her rendition of \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" that Jennifer Hudson was going to walk away with an Oscar-and i was right and congratulations Jennifer. <br /> <br />The scene that affected me the most in the movie besides \\"And I Am Telling....\\" was the scene at the very end when the Dreams invite the \\"fourth Dream\\" to join them for their farewell and as Jamie Foxx notices Effie singing to a young child sitting up front in the audience he leaves his box seat, races down the aisle looks at the child then Effie then the child and the look of loss and regret on his face as he realizes she is his child-I don't think many reviwers noticed but I did and left me with a great big tear in my eye.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|It's not that the screen play was phenomenal or anything, but it was so real. It was a great insight into the sexual psyche of normal people. Nothing about the scenes was inappropriate or rude. Good movie to learn about you and the world around you.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The Illusionist is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />The ending is a fantastic surprise!
4770030096|4.0|I've heard so many good reviews about this book, that I finally bought it. I've learned more with this book about making sentences, than I have with all my other books. My other books start off with \\"This is a pen. That over there is a pen.\\" Yeah ok, how useful is that really?<br /><br />This book tells about Mr. Smith, the lawyer from ABC Foods, and his adventures in Japan. A couple of useful items are Mr. Smith's schedule, and giving directions to a driver. Both of which are great lessons I wish I had known when talking to Japanese friends months ago!! Other relevant subjects are shopping, going out to dinner or a movie. Ordering food, tickets or getting your size clothing is not mentioned. Hopefully that will be covered in future books.<br /><br />This book is well thought out, and gives the definitions of words when they first occur. English translations are only at the beginning of the next lesson. After that, they expect you to remember the words and be able to read Japanese. My only complaints about the book, is I wish they would start introducing kanji in each chapter, and give you more room to write.
B000NA2776|5.0|Ok, that being said, Mika is not actually a total Freddie rip-off he seems on his single, \\"Grace Kelly.\\" He is very eclectic and a lot of very different things are happening on his album, from a heavy 80s feel of \\"Love Today\\" to 90s, to a Barenaked-Ladies-like harmony of \\"My Interpretation.\\" The musical pressure on Mika now is to focus his eclecticism into something a little bit more coherent. Still, i feel that at least 2/3 of this album is wonderful, and i think Mika can break the US market. Whether he can pull it off as a mega-pop star icon is a different question. I think that Mika is a little too weird to pull off another full scale British Invasion that seems to flood this country at least every decade. Still, Mika has a huge potential, his vocal range is amazing- he's another opera-trained singer, following in the footsteps of the operatic voice of Freddie Mercury. Mika is an excellent musician, and this record deserves to be heard. I mark it as 5 Stars not necessarily because i believe the record itself deserves full 5 stars (it's probably at about 4 for me), but because of the potential that Mika has that needs to be noticed, and because of my anticipation for his next project, which i think will be a more focused, more effective project.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|I am a huge fan of the original book Peter Pan, and there are definite aspects of racism toward Native American Indians in the book, but they are not NEARLY as overt or offensive as they are in the Disney edition.  I had totally forgotten (since I saw it when I was young) about the terribly racist treatment of the Native Americans in this film.  If you're committed to the fight for racial justice, don't buy this film.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|If you like Black Humor, you'll like this film. All of the actors do a competent job, but the real star is Alan Arkin, an underappreciated old warhorse who has been around since the late 60s.<br /><br />Those who are offended by the liberal use of profanity or who take beauty pageants seriously, should look elsewhere for their entertainment. But if you're looking for some good laughs, and are willing to suspend your disbelief, you'll enjoy this one. Perfect family entertainment for those who understand that all families are dysfunctional in some way.<br /><br />In a favorable review, a reviewer for the New York Times stated:<br /><br />\\"\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" doesn't look particularly ambitious, in terms of either its narrative or its function-over-form visual style. But tucked in between all the hurt and the jokes, the character development and the across-the-board terrific performances is a surprisingly sharp look at contemporary America, one that sets the metaphor of the stage (and, by extension, competition) against the cherished myth of the open road.\\" Indeed.<br /><br />If you like this film, consider buying [[ASIN:0780628306 Drop Dead Gorgeous]] and/or [[ASIN:630227883X Trust]].
B00005JPFH|4.0|This is one of the best sequels I have seen. Usually by #3 most sequels lose their way from the original, but not this one.  The action is awesome, the emotion gutsy, and Thomas Haden Church makes a surprisingly good villian, aka Sandstorm.  All in all a great flick, and a must see movie.
B00005JPFF|4.0|This is going to be a difficult review to write, but I shall try my best. I waited for Spidey 3 for a hell of a long time. Long, long time. I bought my tickets to see it in IMAX two and a half weeks before it opened. Slowly and even more slowly, the weeks went by alongside tons of schoolwork that only led me closer to the anticipated night.    Well, it's half past midnight and I just got home from seeing it. First of all, let's look at the good side of the movie. The special effects were ASTOUNDING. They were incredibly realistic (even if it IS a comic book movie!) and experiencing the amazingly choreographed fight scenes in IMAX was well worth the extra five bucks per ticket. Sam Raimi's directing has also greatly improved, as he was able to balance somewhat of a minor interlocking storyline between three villains and still manage to keep the movie on its feet. I felt the length of the movie (roughly 2 1/2 hours) was perfect--long enough to keep you entertained, and short enough to keep you from not going bored out of your mind. Raimi and the writers even pack some HYSTERICAL humour into the film, with a classic cameo from Bruce Campbell as the Maitre'd of a French restaurant, plus many other laugh-out-loud hilarious scenes. Plus, my favorite part of the good points, is that Spider-Man 3 is a fun, fun, FUN popcorn movie. Lots of fun. Sometimes you look up at the screen and wonder \\"what in the hell was that?\\" But it's all good, cause overall, it's lots of fun and you end up not caring if the story makes sense or not. (It does, don't worry) The storyline is much more darker, complex, and mature than the first two movies, and it doesn't seem \\"Spider-Man\\" ish, which a lot of people were definitely NOT expecting. I think this is why a lot of people didn't like it. Now the iffy parts. The acting was OK. Yes, just OK. Not good, DEFINITELY not great--just OK. Tobey Maguire had me believing that he had improved from Spider-Man 2 but when we got to the scene with him and MJon the bridge--oh my, the entire audience was gasping for air because we were all laughing so hard at his terrible fake-crying. Kirstin Dunst's acting skills never really annoy me; I think she's a great actress and while she's certainly not as good as many other actresses in Hollywood, she does a fine \\"B\\" job in Spider-Man 3 that works for the movie. I felt James Franco needed some variety, though, as throughout all three Spider-Man films he seems to be acting the same. And, surprisingly, Topher Grace was a lot of fun to watch! It'll be hard to watch That 70s Show again without thinking of Venom! Yet, out of all the performances, Thomas Haden Church comes out on top with a very serious portrayal of Sandman. He blew me away! (pun intended!) I didn't have a huge problem with the corniness of the movie. Yes, I know, the scene with Peter going emo and then gyrating his hips in front of a suit store had me raising my eyebrows, but it was a funny element to the storyline. Sure, we could've done without it, but they got some laughs and that's what counts. There were one or two scenes (particularly MJ and Peter on the bridge) that made me want to get up and leave, but they're over quickly.    The part that bothered me the most, though, is that the \\"strange black entity\\" that bonds with Peter--the symbiote--had no real significance in the story whatsoever. It kinda just...happened. There was no backbone to the symbiote story, nothing about it was explained at all, and it just kinda attached itself to Peter's motorbike and then possessed him. It felt very random and, even though it was the whole movie storyline, very out-of-place. This bothered me a LOT.    Overall: worth the trip, and if you get a chance, see it in IMAX. It's FAR from great, but it's a good film, and I liked it better than the first Spider-Man. A very nice kick-off to the summer movie season. Well done, Mr. Raimi!
B000HA4WTS|5.0|Excellent HD-DVD title. Superior sound and picture quality. Nice interactivity gags. Highly recommended!
B000063V8S|5.0|This was the show that I loved most of Star Trek (other than the occasional love of Kirk or Spock) but TNG really opened Star Trek back up to the world... I wish this show was even now still in action but all things must come to an end I suppose. But I do enjoy having my DVDs to watch on occasion.
1400076943|4.0|Adichie takes any non-African reader into an enthralling fictional world without compromising anything about the context, history and sensibility of Nigerian life. She achieves this through sharp, immediate characterization and a strong storyline. It's not a \\"difficult\\" book - it's a total page-turner - but it packs a great deal of complexity beneath its apparently simple surface. When you finish this slim novel, you know you've been somewhere.
B000002U94|4.0|This CD captures the experience of Bob Seger live.  A must have for Seger fans.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I have been a RUSH fan from the day  they produced their first album with John Rustey on the skins.  I spent a few hours reading all the negative reviews (and some positive) for this CD and it peaked my interested in getting it.  Mind you I am a professional drummer and have the Neil P. DW kit that is exactly the same \\"set up\\" on the acoustics, I hate electronic drums thus I don't have them.  I have been playing for 35 years now and always looked up to RUSH for a music lesson (I am a Jazz fusion Drummer)  So here is my review of S&A. <br /> <br />I agree with a lot of the negative comments with respect to the tracks having the same feel.  So I added S&A to my iPOD shuffle and shuffled it with a mix of Keiko Matsui and Buddy Rich and Ice Age and reached a completely different conclusion.  S&A is one of the better albums that RUSH has produced musically etc.  The band is tight with time and really goes back to their roots by playing with some odd time etc.  I am not going to bore any of you with the tech of the music but I will say it is brilliant and this CD is will worth a listen and the cost. <br /> <br />For the guys and gals that are down on this album, try mixing it with a cross section of Jazz etc. and I think you will get a whole new view of it.  Frankly speaking I think RUSH could have done a much better job of laying out the tracks.  After the first listen I too felt too much was done on the CD and it all started to blend.  Thanks to Apple I know have heard some of RUSH's finest music :)
B000053VAZ|5.0|One of my all time favorites- just a cute, feel good movie that is easy to watch.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I am so glad this wasn't the final season! Loved this show.  The 'series finale' wasn't as near satisfying as season 8, but would have been ok.  Good intrapersonal relationships, effects, plotlines. Avatars didn't seem to realize the contradiction in themselves, by ignoring their own dual natures. Good addition to the series. (which to me, had NO 'bad' seasons)
B000H5TVKI|4.0|With the amount of different versions of the Rambo movies on DVD, you really get the best of both worlds with this one.  For years, the very good David Morrel commentary was the highlight until a Sly Stallone version came out... both commentaries are excellent.  The transfer is good for a movie that was shot back in 1982, the sound is pretty good. With the amount of \\"bubble gum' movies out there, this one is reasonibly priced, great replay value and one of the best Sly movies to boot!!!!
B000002ADT|5.0|I like this CD lots!  Miles Davis is my very favorite and I think this is his CD.  Thanks for sending it so quickly.
B000KN9G3E|5.0|The real bonus here is the 55 minute documentary taking in the 1985-86 period spanning from Shake The Disease through to Singles 81-85 and right through to the Black Celebration and the subsequent highly successful tour, and th eitroduction of Anton corbijn to the scene. It is great to see Alan included in these documentaries. I was especially happy to hear that he did try (unsuccessfully) to have the It's Called A Heart single and Fly on The Windscreen B side \\"flipped around\\". A very interesting time for DM as this album probably represents their \\"link\\" from their early \\"naive\\" years and their latter \\"stadium rocker\\" years. Lots of great home video footage of the band - with lots of smiles and laughter.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|I actually borrowed this CD from a friend - I didn't want to throw my money away, I just needed to satisfy my curiousity.  Smart decision.  If Rush was unknown, and this was their first CD being played for the record execs, they would never get a recording contract.  There's no substance here.  Boring, mundane, uninspiring.  I don't long for the \\"OLD\\" sound of Rush, I just hope that one day they recapture the MAGIC they once had.  There's nothing wrong with changing your sound, you just can't be lazy and change it to junk.  Too much filtering and electronics.  Go back and listen to the blockbuster song \\"Spirit of the radio\\".  The song was an enormous commercial success for many reasons.  I'm not looking for another \\"Spirit\\", but I would like something equally bombastic for a change.  I don't expect magic on every record, but once every couple of decades isn't really asking too much.  Until that day comes, I've got very shallow pockets.
055358202X|4.0|This series has captured my interest because of the complex characters and underlying supernatural theme.  The characters are well fleshed out and even the bad guys are given enough good qualities to understand their actions from their perspective.  I'm surprised by twists in the plot and never know what will happen next.<br /><br />BUT.....will the author ever finish the series?  I suggest that you wait until it is finished to start the series.  Otherwise you will forget the plot and many characters before the next installment comes out.<br /><br />MR. MARTIN:  Please focus on finishing what you have started.  It isn't fair to your readers to buy half a story with no end in sight.
B00005JPCF|5.0|What a great movie!  It's fun and entertaining and drop-dead cute.
B000M4RG42|5.0|My dad was part of that war time Navy and a POW of eleven months by Japan.  The movie is Typical of how the Government spends time and money training our troops and in return Abandon the returning combat GI's without Any proper emotional transition support.  Only calls them names and arresting the rest from support.  <br /> <br />I too am a US Army Vet. <br />  <br />Can you tell I loved the flick?  Buy It!   <br />
0709058764|4.0|I found this to be a fantastic book.  It is very well written and beautifully illustrated.  The text covers every detail of the art of making a violin.  It does lack in a few areas however.  I would have been thrilled with the addition of some information on original design and or mechanical drawing of a violin.  Also, the book is a bit thin in the areas of plate graduation, tap toning, wood selection, tools and varnish. Overall though, I highly recommend this book; it is more than enough to get anyone started on building their first violin.  I'm sure it is the best text currently being published.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie makes one Think or it should and makes me want to move to higher grounds.   <br />Avoid the Nay sayers!  Buy It!  Plant Trees. <br /> <br /> In This Life All things are possible! <br />
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I remember hearing about this movie a while ago.  Of course the critics hated it but when have they ever agreed with the general public?  There are two movies out about Magic these days and the other is the Prestige.  Both the Illusionist and the Prestige were awesome in their own way.  The Illusionist had an awesome plot and the magic was very unique.  I can;t give away too much here but one of the tricks in the movie makes you feel stupid, especially when they show how it's done.  As they always say, always expect the obvious and well, that trick was tooooo obvious.  One of the best movies I have seen in a while; romance, intrigue, plot and great Illusions.  i cannot see how anyone would not like this flick!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I'm not a music critic, but I know what I like. Every track on \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is simply irrestible. I can't stop listening to it. <br />Michael has proven that he is an amazing performer. <br />Don't compare him to Sinatra. Don't compare him to Bobby Darin. Don't compare him to Harry Connick, Jr. <br />He is Michael Bublé--A consumate entertainer in his own right. <br />If you have any doubts, discard them now and buy this CD. It's destined for greatness!
B00079FUI6|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I watched it like a million times! will never sell my set of DVDs :).
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This movie is so funny and it makes me laugh more each time I see it.  I now have a tradition every Christmas to see this movie.  I never get tired of seeing it every year and look forward to it.  Chevy Chase has always been one of my favorite movie stars.
032147404X|5.0|Kelby is the best.  Even those of us who think we are pretty darn good photographers can benefit from this no nonsense how to book which covers most of the map on digital photography.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|She has the most amazing voice.  Not one tract that I didn't like !!!
B00009R6J7|5.0|This is an amazingly simple to use and effective device - never again have anyone tell you, \\"Great picture, but it's crooked.\\"
B000LAZDQA|5.0|While a lot of the buzz around this film relates to its depiction of sex, it is actually a truly beautiful film.  The characters are interesting and the message is touching.  The use of music is also exceptional.  Highly recommended.
B00005JPFH|1.0|I just watched it. That movie was very painful to watch. Not only the worse of the three, but it had nothing good about it. Not even action. The acting was a joke, the writing was a joke, the story was a joke. I mean good God that movie was horrible. Eddie Brock? More like Eric Forman with a backbone. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, I figured I would at least get some nice action like in the second one. But not even that. Venom? Where? I saw mean Eric Forman in a black costume. And the dance scene in the place MJ was singing at. Good God. What the hell? And the whole \\"look at me dance through the street having all the girls look at me.\\". That movie was flat out horrible. Now I have a really bad taste in my mouth. I think I should go watch Batman & Robin or Elektra. Yeah, the movie was really that bad. Maybe even the worse movie I have seen. I never thought I would see something as bad as Open Water but I might have just found it. I want my my 2 1/2 hours back. Hell it took two hours for anything decent to happen. And saying the final battle is decent is really a huge compliment that it doesn't deserve based on the previous two hours of horrible movie. Nothing positive to say about this movie. Not one single damn thing. Horrible movie. <br /> <br />I now know what people mean when they say they feel that their child hood was just molested because it really was that horrible beyond recognition. <br /> <br />Oh my God. How could I forget the horrible ending. The way he beat the symbiote. What a joke.
B000M341QO|5.0|I haven't seen a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat in a long, long time.  This one did.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I really liked the first two Rocky movies, but 3, 4, and 5 were like horrible cartoons: shallow, predictable, nothing much to them, and cliched. I must admit that I thought this was going to be a big joke of a movie. I am very much wrong about it. It 'feels' a lot like the first two. It has dialogue much richer and deeper than the middle three, and it was NOT over the top. It was down to earth, and would have made the perfect ending to a trilogy of a saga. Little wonder why this one is called Rocky Balboa and not Rocky VI.
B00005JPD0|4.0|I love time travel movies, but they always have so many plot holes. This one seems to have a few, but it has a tight script for the most part. Denzel Washington delivers as usual and the movie moves at a brisk pace. Worth a rental or even a blind buy if you like Sci-Fi/Thriller/Time Travel movies.
B000002OR4|5.0|It's by far one of the best pieces of music ever written for a movie. Just by listening it brings back the same feeling of overwhelming that the movie had.
0679745653|5.0|I made the unfortunate mistake of watching Edward Blake's classic film adaptation before reading Truman Capote's novella BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S.  However, I was glad to have gotten a chance to buy/read the story of Holly Golightly and her life's endeavors in New York City and beyond as written from the perspective of one of her many male followers.<br /><br />Capote allows the reader to create their own image of Golightly, although I had serious problems getting Ms. Audrey Hepburn's image of Holly out of my head.  The brilliance behind Capote's work is his focus on the character of Holly and continually giving her an air of something almost like immorality.  She is a beautiful soul, and Capote lets her get away with just about anything.  It's because she is the ultimate dreamer, and regardless of the common sense men and women alike try to shove into her face, she ignores it.  Her life and how she wants it to be per her mind's eye is just too important to ignore.<br /><br />I would recommend this novella and its collection of other short stories as well.  Capote is a force to be reckoned with, and he doesn't apologize for anything he includes on paper.  This is too good to pass over.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Incredible Information.  A must see for everyone no matter what your polital views are
1400079179|3.0|I originally read this because I was on a dating site and every single person seemed to have read it...so I checked it out. If this was really a religion...I'd be religious. This is a great read and it made me want to learn more about a lot of different topics. I wish there were more references and resources listed in back to follow up regarding some of the crazy stuff that sounds so real.
0679720200|5.0|I will never forget my introduction to Albert Camus' THE STRANGER.  As an alienated twelve year old girl, the main character who ends up involved with shady people and their [equally] shady dealings was compelling and evocative to me.  Here, our character finds himself pulled into a world of pimps, violence and love affairs where is emotionally detached and absent from any form of intimacy (other than in the physical sense).  I can see why THE STRANGER has stood the test of time.  It is truly timeless.......
B00000IMTF|5.0|After reading the other reviews, what can one say? Just this: I own this album since it was released in 1976 (back then as an LP, now as CD) and it is the only album from that time that today still gives me the goosebumps. (allthough I agree with the other reviewer that 'Do You Close Your Eyes?' is a weak point). To me it is almost unbelievable that an album that was recorded more than 30 (!!!) years ago, can still today sound so fresh and new. But this one  does, and will continue to do so. This is a Legendary Album. If you are interested in rock music and don't own this one: go to the store as fast as you can and buy it! Rock doesn't get any better than this.
6300182282|5.0|Doris (Ellen Burstyn) is a young housewife who has a chance encounter with George Peters (Alan Alda), at a country bed and breakfast.  Though married to others, the two have an instant connection and mutual attraction.  Though, both of them are devoted to their spouses and children, they agree to meet at the same time and place, year in and year out.  As their 26 year love affair progresses, their conversations reflect the evolution of United States politics and social issues.<br /><br />This film is funny, insightful and witty.  Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn have wonderful screen chemistry.  They are very believable and are a joy to watch, as they celebrate one another's joyous ups and comfort each other at their darkest hours in life.  Really great!
B000059GEH|5.0|my girls and i always watch this when we're in the mood for something funny and lighthearted.  it's a charming movie featuring 3 adorable women, and it's funny without being bawdy or crude.  and of course we love happy endings.
0767821769|5.0|This movie is a great feel-good movie. I particularly liked the way the director made it impossible for the viewers to pick a side between Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon's characters.  <br /> <br />The scene where the dying Susan Sarandon takes her daughter for one last horsepack ride at 5 in the morning, is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen!  <br /> <br />This movie also shows how great of an actress Julia Roberts really is. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys to watch a poignant, heartfelt family drama.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|When this movie came out in the theaters, I thought the previews for it made it look stupid so I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. Fast forward to USA Network promoting it; these commercials actually made the movie look tolerable so I decided to DVR it. When I finally watched this movie I couldn't believe how good it was. Will Ferrell (who ordinarily I cannot stand; he is too over the top in his movies) was great as was all the supporting cast. He is a genuinely good-hearted elf just trying to meet and earn the affection of his real father. This movie has been added to my must-view list during Christmastime because it was so sweet and funny and NOTHING like the movie previews.
B00005JPCF|5.0|If you're not in to musicals or animals, or if you don't know how to just watch a movie to enjoy it without analyzing it to death, this is not the movie for you.  Yes, there is the political message running throughout most of the movie.  However, it's the cutest thing ever.  We saw it at the theater surrounded by a bunch of kids who loved the movie too.  The only thing that upset me was that Mumble never fully molted off all his baby feathers (which would play in to the over-analyzation of the movie).  The CGI is amazing.  It was so good we were trying to determine which parts were real footage and which weren't (especially the end with the chopper).  If you want to analyze the movie, I'll give you a hint on the villain - it's the humans.  I have not met anyone who doesn't absolutely love this movie.  If you're unsure after all the contradicting reviews, rent it or borrow it from someone before you add this movie to your collection.
074356619X|5.0|This is much more extensive than the DVD. Rhonda Byrne, the creator of the DVD, \\"The Secret\\" goes into much greater detail of the material, 10 chapters in all like The Secret to Money and The Secret to Health as well as The Secret to You and the final chapter, The Secret to Life. Her beautiful voice and tone bring the book \\"Alive\\" with feeling. This is my favorite of the DVD, the book and the audio CD's. I agree with Bob Proctor who says she is absolutely \\"illuminated\\". Get it and listen, you'll be transformed by her passion and understanding of The Secret.[[ASIN:B000K8LV1O The Secret (Extended Edition)]]
6304698798|5.0|You cannot watch westerns without watching The good the bad and the ugly <br />Simple as that, this movie rocks :-)
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Great soundtracks from the movie, a couple songs weren't or I don't recall hearing them.  If you liked the movie you'll like this.
1878424319|5.0|I was referred to this book and it was awesome.  Just some basic things that we take for granted.  It is an easy read and hard to put down.  It speaks to everyday situations and give you the tools for make a better you.  Great BOOK!!!!!!!!!
B000JLTRKE|4.0|This isn't a movie about why or how as much as it is a movie of the 18th and 19th survivors pulled from the wreckage.  Oliver Stone did an excellent job of showing how this fateful day effected two Port Authority Officers and their families with such intensity that my wife had to take a break, it was really a lot to take in.  The movie was well done, the actors were on top of their game, even in a difficult situation that they were given.
B0000UJL96|3.0|The folks from MST 3k are running a great new service where they provide audio tracks to go along with... quesionable... movies. This is one of them, and the commentary is funny, and the movie is actually watchable (unlike, say, Firewall).  <br /> <br />As far as the movie itself - I remember going to see it on the opening weekend, and probably the most memorable and entertaining part of the experience was the local chapter of Serious Trekkies had their own section of the theater roped off, and the place was just swarming with people in spandex and velcro shoes. As far as the movie itself, its probably one of the worst Star Trek films, though it is just about cheesy enough to be entertaining in its own right.  <br /> <br />I think that a one-eyed shakespeare-spouting klingon dude should just be a staple of every sci fi movie from now on.
0307277887|5.0|this book is so gloriously dark. obviously different than the show, just little differences here and there, this book sucks you in and the show gives dexter and everything else a better picture.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Quirky, kinky, sensual, beautiful and fun! <br /> <br />James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal both have wonderful performances!  Steven Shainberg put together a great film with more substance then may be expected from a love story.  That said, be warned that if you are uncomfortable with the idea of bdsm being anything other then a sickness then \\"keep on walking\\" because this is not a movie for you. <br /> <br />One of the things I liked most was the depth of character development.  Gyllenhaal and Spader had fantastic chemistry and were able to pack so much emotion and communication in to simple expressions and gestures.  I can't say enough good things about the work they have done here. <br /> <br />As for the story, I LOVE IT!  Both Mr. Grey (Spader) and Lee (Gyllenhaal) start out in dark places.  Lee is drifting in life and has taken to cutting herself.  Mr. Grey is alone and disgusted with himself.  Both struggle with \\"unnatural\\" feelings and a sense of detachment, they just don't feel normal.  By the end they have learned that it is OK not to be normal so long as you are who and what you are.  They fine that together they are complete.  A very satisfying ending!
078322933X|4.0|when watching this really good movie, you realize just how old it is. william petersen for starters just makes you want to watch him as grissom on csi, wahlberg straight off of calvin klein billboards and witherspoon centuries before winning her oscar for walk the line. well worth the watch it keeps you in the whole time.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I wouldn't have acted THAT way over breakups with men, but when God closes a door He opens a window.  A DreamY life swap of not-so-perfect situations into perfect situations.  Jude Law is soo DreamY in this, I'd jump into bed with him too!  AND Jack Black...he's actually appealing (no SH_T!)  Each girl \\"finds\\" herself and discovers she doesn't NEED a man, but WANTS one anyhow.  A real escape!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|One of there best yet, can not wait to see them in concert, I love there music its so pretty
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I needed to watch this film twice to really appreciate the complexity of the characters.  Who's baby is it, Leonardo's or Matt Damon's?  Jack Nicholson is fabulous (as always) and its a star studded cast.  Who knew this happens?  I hope its not all fantasy.  I've heard of moles but WOW!  Really an all time great film!
B000GY729M|3.0|With the release of the Killers' debut album Hot Fuss, their sound helped usher in a revival of the new wave sound (something that I, a big fan of `80s music, had absolutely no problem with). Now they come back at us with Sam's Town, an album that is getting very heavily mixed reviews. But I think it's somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />At first, though, I had to make sure that this was really the Killers. Not that their sound is any different, but, well, it's still the same four guys, but they look, like, ten years older now (and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. now looks like Jason Lee). Anyway, I wasn't that much into \\"When You Were Young\\" for a long time, but it's really grown on me now. But my favorite song would have to be the current single, \\"Read My Mind\\".<br /><br />There are also a few songs on here that sound like Brandon and the boys are shooting for an arena rock sound. Not that the songs sound bad, but I think listeners would appreciate them more if they were heard at live performances. Oh, well; \\"This River Is Wild\\" and \\"Bling (Confession of a King)\\" are decent enough.<br /><br />But then you have a group of corny tracks like \\"My List\\", \\"For Reasons Unknown\\" and \\"Bones\\" (sorry; I never liked that song). And the intro and outro are pretty cheesy too (and shouldn't the intro be the first track instead of the second track?). As another reviewer hinted at, Sam's Town is an okay place to visit, but you might want to revisit Hot Fuss first.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
067003830X|5.0|For me, a special education teacher this was brain candy.  The book was so exciting I could not put it down, as exciting to me as Harry Potter.  I read it in just a couple of days and passed it on. <br />I was educated in the 50's and 60's by teachers of the \\"Old School\\" and I found that often the old practices that were used were validated in the book.  Practices such as Chapter 2 rote memorization,chapter 3-getting things right, and learning a new language, Chapter 6 paying conseqenses for mistakes, and Chapter 7 why grandma's kisses take away pain, chpater 8- drill.  For my own self the concept of building up a cognitive reserve, and the importance of education and continuing education.   <br />I am sure others reading it will find som many other things in the book, this is just a small sampling from me and I took pages of notes. <br />The research is fresh, some as late as July 2006, not even a year old at this writing.   <br />This was a real value for the money book and I compliment the author.  One winning book! <br />
B00005O3VC|4.0|This movie starts with some clips that make you feel you are lost, or took the wrong DVD to watch... soon enough you realize that even the opening lines, and the credits have been written to keep you laughing... not sure if at the plot... or at the fact that you are watching one of the silliest films ever made. <br /> <br />But... we watch from beginning to end... The movie starts with King Arthur of the Britons searching throughout the land for brave men to join him to form Camelot... the Knights of the Round Table.  <br /> <br />He finds the pure Sir Galahad... the daring and brave Sir Lancelot...  As the movie opens, you hear the distant clapping of horses hooves, only to realize that what you are indeed hearing is only  a servant, banging coconuts together to pretend... and you know you are in for an ever ending sequence of rather funny and definitely silly recreations of history... where famous characters spend their days and nights overcoming obstacles in search of the Holy Grail. <br /> <br />King Arthur is played by Graham Chapman, while John Cleese is seen as the Second Swallow-Savvy Guard, The Black Knight, Peasant #3, Sir Lancelot, the Brave, the French Guard who taunts King Arthur's group, and finally as Tim, the Enchanter.   <br /> <br />In the end... King Arthur finds the Castle of Arrrghhh... where the Holy Grail actually is... and we had no choice but to say to ourselves.... Arrrghhh!!!  <br /> <br /> <br />
1582701709|1.0|Simplistic and corny are a good start to describing The Secret. Napolean Hill, Tony Robbins and others have talked about the power of positive imagery without making it in to a magic formula akin to \\"just think, you may win the lottery\\". <br /> <br />imagine, ask and receive? Ok, how about know what you want, positive imagery helps, and work very hard to get the things that you want. Oh wait, its a much easier sale if you tell people they can just imagine it and it will happen. <br /> <br />They make leaps of logic using pseudo-science, and take famous quotes completely out of context to make their case.  <br /> <br />sad that folks are deceived by such
B000NVIXFK|4.0|solid album From Rush....Not crazy about a lot of stuff they did, but Snake and arrows is a great one.  Their best since signal IMO.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|We forget what a creative force that Dylan has been over the past 50 years, and this film reminds us in spades.  It needs to be seen with Scorcese' No Direction Home, because they capture a young artist at the moment of his maximum creativity and it is an awe-inspiring sight.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is the highest review I have ever given anything, and as far as I can recall, the only time I have given it.  The staging at the Castle was wonderful.  These are the most gifted singers I have ever heard, and I have been associated with music all my life.  The filming, including the tight shots, was excellent; the orchestra was excellent as was the conductor.  Each singer was excellent in their individual numbers and as a group, the colors of their individual voices and personalities blended uniquely to became one.
B000AM6OQ2|3.0|It wasn't so much the fog itself but that sound that accompanied what was in the fog.  Good movie for children's sleep overs - since they do not go to sleep anyhow.  Good story line, good acting and interesting characters.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This is the daddy of sci-fi films - and has Leslie Nielsen in a serious part! <br />Also comes with a second  movie The Invisible Boy that features that robot again - the missing movie from many collections. Great presentation too.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Great movie, the Blu-Ray version in terms of visual and audio are superb. Buy this movie, get the player Blu-Ray is worth the price.
1582701709|4.0|The power of thought is very strong but there is one part of the equation left out by the authors, the power of ACTION. Wishing hard for something, thinking \\"correctly\\" is not enough. If it were, more people would win the lottery. You must actually work, too. Sometimes your vision may be an indirect by product of your action but action is important. Perhaps the boy whose bike just showed up was also working, helping an elderly neighbor for free or being diligent in his chores, but that portion of the story wasn't told. This phenomenon of The Secret just missed the mark by a little bit, most of it is quite good.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I have the orginial copy of this movie.  The Blu-ray version is the director's cut which adds scenes not shown in the theather release.  This release fill in a lot of the holes that the theater release had and provides the view with a more complete historical account of the events.  The visual effects of Blu-Ray are great and is the audio track.  Sony has delivered its promise in respect to Blu-Ray technology.  <br />    The only negative thing I can say is that the orginial release did contain under special affect a pilgrim verison of the movie, which provided the view actual historical background to the scene being display,verus some screen writer's view to sell the movie to the public (hisorical false -- history according to Hollywood.  With Blu-Ray being hawked as being able to contain more information it should have be an easy thing to do, but the studio got cheap and have short changed the viewer and purchaser.  Wrote to the studio but never got a response.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|This fascinating movie based on the novel by PD James has an original and provocative theme -- for some inexplicable reason, the population has become infertile.  It could have occurred because of pollution, gamma rays, radiation or some unknown factor.  Scientists don't know but the end result is that the last child was born on earth 18 years ago.<br /><br />Set in dreary England, besieged by civil unrest and a totalitarian state, Children of Men stars Clive Owens as a disillusioned revolutionary who sees no future for himself or his fractured family.  His ex-wife is played by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine gives a strong performance as an eccentric hippie type who lives in a cabin in a remote area with his catatonic wife.<br /><br />Enter the modern-day Virgin Mary -- she's black and part of an ethnic minority that is reviled.  The chase is on as the Clive Owen dude risks everything in order to save the life of the unborn child and its host.<br /><br />The concept of this movie was terrific, acting was good and filming was marvelous.  However, character development was weak and there were many unanswered questions in terms of plot, along with an unnecessarily long and predictable ending.<br /><br />Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.  The idea that we might become infertile is not so improbable; we already have declining population rates in North America, Europe and Russia, not because we can't reproduce but because many people are choosing not to, which is also scary!  Fertility is an important topic.  As Shakespeare said, the fundamental question remains: To be or not to be?<br /><br />Sigrid Mac
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Great movie.  Daniel Craig has pick up where the other Bond actors left off and has done a great job.
B00005JPGO|5.0|This movie is one of the great movies from the '06 year.... Leonardo DiCaprios performance is as good as it gets as well as Dijmon Hounsou. Very powerful movie, very entertaining. I recomend this to any who enjoys watching movies
B00005J6UP|5.0|Great Movie. It's unfortunate how the magic sometimes goes away when you rewatch a film from your childhood... nonetheless, still a good time.
0618680004|5.0|Kudos to Mr. Dawkins for getting out a book that crystallizes all the reasons why God does not exist, and that believers are just deluding them selves. Its not us infidels who are at fault, but the \\"chosen people\\" who enforce their will, and legislate their nonsense on the rest of us. <br />The beauty of the book is that he goes through all the arguments *for* a super natural power and debunks them, step by step. And then he clearly lays out why its just not possible for God to exist.  <br />Then he talks about the evils of religion, the past and modern day crusades, the lies & hypocrisy of our religious leaders, and the excuses churned out by  various apologists. <br />Master piece!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This CD is worth twice the price just for \\"Rock Bottom! Michael Schenker must have been temporarily possessed during his lead solo on this song. I have this release on vinyl, can't wait to hear it with the clarity of CD. If you can only fit one UFO album (CD) in your collection, please make it this one. On this release, not only do you hear the songs, but you feel them. That doesn't happen very often. Must have been magic in the air that night (or nights) it was recorded. I would suggest you sweep your floor before you listen to \\"Rock Bottom\\" so your jaw doesn't get dirty when it drops.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Got these a couple months ago, they are installed in the trunk area of my Jeep that sees a lot of rough offroad terrain, even though they are made of plastic they are very durable and have yet to fail me.  I have yet to even have the light fall out of the clips regardless of how rough the ride go.  Good price and good quality.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|We have watched the TV series Planet Earth narrated by Sigourney Weaver and have enjoyed it immensely.  We bought the DVD set narrated by David Attenborough and were highly disappointed. Mr. Attenborough's voice is not the problem; the problem lies with the balance between the volume of his voice and that of the music. The volume has to be turned up to hear his voice, in which case the music volume becomes intolerable. We found ourselves straining to hear what he was saying and playing it back to listen to what we missed.  It is such beautiful photography, it is a shame that it is so poorly produced.  Instead of taking us on a wonderful serene voyage around the planet, we found our experience quite stressful and had to return the discs.
B00003CXBH|4.0|The content of the film is excellent. the DVD is good, but at some point the picture stops, few seconds after it runs again.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The quality of this HD DVD title has by far the best HD in my collection.
1582701709|1.0|Well it seems like Ms. Byrne has certainly proven one thing by writing this book - as P.T. Barnum said many years ago \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\"!  If sales of her book are any indication, Mr. Barnum's estimate was far too conservative. <br /> <br />For most of us, by the time we reach adulthood, hopefully we've learned that carrying around lucky rabbit's feet and wishing on lucky stars in the hopes that our dreams will come true is not the way the world (or the cosmos for that matter, work - thankfully)  To think that any intelligent, free-thinking individual would fall for this kind of baloney in the 21st century is to me at least, mind-boggling. <br /> <br />Lewis Carroll said it so well when he wrote \\"if you don't know which path your on, any path will do\\", and I recently heard it put another way \\"if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for just about anything\\".  No truer case could be made for such a statement than this book. <br /> <br />RadioActive1
074325144X|1.0|I bought the book with a lot of expectations and I was disappointed. The author keeps on sayng trivial statements as if they were his own discovery. Not a very useful book.
B00005JPFH|3.0|Spiderman 3 adheres pretty tightly to the \\"More is More\\" theory.  More villains, more subplots, more running time, more special effects, etc.  It is a big, loud \\"Summer\\" movie...apparently among the most expensive ever made...and the money shows on screen. <br /> <br />It is also an occasionally boring or silly movie.  I realize this is a comic-book movie, but Spiderman 2 gave us enough believable humanity that we now kind of expect this series to present believable humans enduring unbelievable things and reacting in a way that resembles the human race as we know it. <br /> <br />SPOILERS AHEAD  (BIG ONES): <br />Spiderman 3 veers back into incredulity.  For example...(this could be spoiler if you haven't seen any previews), Peter becomes infected with some black goop that not only turns his red suit to black...but unleashes his id.  He pulls his hair down over his forehead, resembling the lead singer of The Cure or Fall Out Boy.  That's amusing.  Then he begins to strut around the neighborhood, checking out the girls and buying \\"stylish\\" clothes in a scene that looks like it would be a spoof of Saturday Night Fever in a movie like Date Movie.  It's a sketch comedy bit in a bloated Action movie.  It was painfully out of place. <br /> <br />There are other moments.  Mary Jane Watson, Peter's beloved, never manages to tell Peter she's lost her Broadway gig.  Granted, their relationship is struggling...but she would have told him at some point.   <br /> <br />Also, I'm finding it harder to buy all the coincidences.  First, the black goop falls from a meteor that happens to land right where Peter has his moped parked.  Then Flint Marko, the \\"bad guy\\" just happens to stumble into a scientific experiment at just the perfect moment to be turned into Sandman.  And then when Peter sheds the black stuff, he manages to drop it right onto his nemesis Brock.  It just stretches my willingness to suspend disbelief. <br /> <br />Also, while we're on the \\"bad\\" stuff:  James Franco as Peter's friend/enemy Harry is terrible.  When his character gets amnesia, he also becomes a complete goofball.  And when he gets his memory back and is \\"torn\\" between helping or hurting Peter...his torment is just laughable.  I know Franco garnered a lot of acclaim in his earlier career...but he pretty much wasted any goodwill I might have had for him.  And frankly, Tobey Maguire looked mostly bored in his role.  I know he's always felt some ambivalence towards his role...but they paid you enough to lose that ambivalence, Tobey.  Get over being filthy rich, successful and a star!  I know it's tough, but suck it up! <br /> <br />SPOILERS OVER: <br />On the good side, we have nice performances from Topher Grace, who is alternately amusing and despicable.  Here's an actor who has some spark.  He could be in a league with Ryan Gosling if given the chance.  Think of his work in TRAFFIC.  Thomas Hayden Church does well by Marko/Sandman.  (And our sympathy for him is helped by EXCELLENT special effects for his various transformations.)  Bruce Campbell has a brief but VERY funny cameo as an unctuous French maitre d.  Thanks, Sam Raimi, for continuing to use him! <br /> <br />The most important parts of any Spiderman movie are the action sequences, of course, and there are some good ones, alright!  The scene in which Spiderman saves the girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the malfunctioning high-rise crane is a blast.  There's real suspense there.  The final scene is over-the-top and exciting...especially as cars, cinderblocks and other debris plunge dangerously close to the imperiled Mary Jane.   <br /> <br />So I found the movie to be somewhat of a letdown from the psychological and acting standpoint.  The screenplay was just TOO packed...trying to be too many things to too many people.  But you won't complain about the action set-pieces...they are state-of-the-art.  So if you lower your expectations a little...you'll still have fun.  3.5 stars. <br />
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Awesome music.  Even the children will stop and sit and watch the video. We also own the music CD. This music is even great in the office as it relaxes you and you can get more things done.  We own the first Celtic Woman and that is well worth buying too.
6305594252|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  The intrigue, the mystery, the wonder of traveling through the gate, discovering a ancient civilization, finding the way back home (in more ways than one) - all are covered in this movie.  It pulls you in and doesn't let you go until the end.  I love Kurt Russell and he is great in this movie, even though he's not the only main character.  And to see that such a movie brought to TV, has lasted 10+ years is amazing!<br /><br />It's such a great adventure - a must see for those who have not seen it and for those who have - they'll see it over and over again!!!!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I think this is one of the best cds!!i rearry like it!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I must preface this by declaring I have not read the paperbacks, and can therefore give no assurance as to the accuracy of the show with the books.<br /><br />But that's a moot point.<br /><br />The show as a standalone original tale is worthy of -- and requires -- a second season. And a third. Basically, it shouldn't stop.<br /><br />The freedom of a premium cable medium allows the show to fully explore the violent nature of such a character's world -- there's plenty of profanity and gore to sate my morbid appetite.<br /><br />But it's the softer moments of this show that inspire pathos. Seeing the pain a killer feels about the charade he must perform for the world to appear \\"normal,\\" the viewer is imbued with an overwhelming sense of empathy. Whether we are killers isn't even the point -- we can all identify with the daily life and lies of Dexter Morgan.<br /><br />From his sister Deb who wants only to connect and is consistently rejected, to his girlfriend Rita and her two young children, to the dark history and teachings of his stepfather Harry, the policeman and idol of our tragic hero, Dexter is surrounded by loving family and friends; but none of them can ever know the truth. And this is Dexter's main mode of survival -- but this lifeline to normality cannot change who he is.<br /><br />Character development, cinematography, dialogue, plot, subplot(s), even the score is awesome, both amusingly quirky and appropriately unnerving. The emotional swells are so vast and intriguing you find yourself wishing you had a friend like Dex, if only to see how a life like that is possible. This show certainly gives us a good idea.<br /><br />If body parts, bloody crime scenes, ice cream with the kids, family reunions, a suspicious sergeant and lots of Saran Wrap are your idea of a good time, Dexter is a must own.
630469654X|5.0|What a great romance. I watched it when I was younger and I think I enjoy it even more now. It was such a moving story that your heart just goes out to the characters.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Overall, I thought that it was a good movie. Was it supposed to take place right after the first movie? It had to of, due to the fact that Corvinus had the bodies of Viktor and Amelia transported back to him. I also think the whole love story between Selene and Michael was weird. In the first one, there was definitely some sexual tension but it was just something that was there. At the end, it seemed like it didn't matter much to Selene and was just another thing in her way. But right quickly in the second one do they prove that wrong. I also think they handled that scene extremely well. Nowadays it is usually you have to show everything but they made the scene where you totally get the idea but it is done in a tasteful fashion. You can't see absolutely anything (I know boys how disappointed that made you!) but they way they showed the scene it was like you could see everything. Basically, you totally got the idea! The movie overall was pretty bloody (no surprise there!) <br /> <br />I thought it was also extremely ironic how Kraven was such a big part of the first movie yet; he is killed in the first five minutes of the second. I actually liked the second movie a lot better than the first one. I totally recommend people seeing it! <br /> <br />Michael and Selene are actually pretty well matched. I really like their pairing and when I thought he was dead, I thought I was going to kill someone! If he had actually died the movie would have been the worst movie on the face of the earth. You cannot have a love (even though fake) like that in a movie and then kill off one of the characters. It should be like sacrilegious or something; it just should not be done. There is never a need to kill something as sweet as that when nothing like that actually exists. It is something greater than you can ever hope for so when you see it no one should ever interfere with something as strong as that. If there is no hope for a love in this world then there should at least be a dream that it could happen. I think that was what I liked most about the movie. It was so blatantly obvious how much Michael cared for her and when he died just how much she cared for him. It is like a love that will stand the test of time and I am so happy that they ended up together. I think that brought it up to being one of my favorite movies. The first one had potential but the second one was just a great story. This movie definitely has something for both boys and girls and I would recommend it to everyone, especially if you have as much fascination with vampires and werewolves as I do.

B000BQ7BX2|4.0|Gary Bertini and the Cologne Radio Symphony?  The Mahler symphonies have been recorded in toto by many of the \\"biggest\\" names in music Leonard Bernstein (three times), Solti, Kubelik, Haitink and so on with the best known orchestras in the world ---- Vienna Philharmonic, Concertgebouw, New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Berlin Philharmonic, and so on and so on.  I've given away my bias by those I've chosen to list and the sequence I've put them in.   <br />And along comes a little known conductor, now deceased, with an orchestra I would not rank with those above; and by virtue of their sheer musicianship they belong alongside all the above.  Mr. Bertini's performances hew closer to Mr. Kubelik and Mr. Haitink in being moderate in both tempo and phrasing.  At the same time, Mr. Bertini still beings a far greater feeling of intensity and passion than either.  Mr. Bertini's performances have  a sweep and a grandeur that places them on the same plane as Mr. Bernstein's performances without entirely going \\"over the top\\" as Mr. B. was inclined to do.   <br />No: Bertini's recording of the Sixth Symphony does not take us emotionally to the depth of Mr. Bernstein's last recording (DG digital).  Nor has Mr. Solti's magnificent performance of the Eighth been surpassed.  But I were asked to choose one cycle to live with for the rest of my life, it would be this one.
B000007OTH|5.0|Max Bruch did not exhaust the possibilities for romantic, passionate violin performance in concerto. He merely came close.<br /><br />That astonishing achievement earns this underrated late-Romantic composer a place in every listener's library, to say nothing of the Hall of Honor inhabited by 'classical' composers. Kurt Masur's baton leading the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and the inspired violin of Salvatore Accardo in this 1998 Philips 'Duo' release of recordings made in 1978, 1979, 1984, and 1988 make this a CD well worth owning.<br /><br />The title is anomalous, since the two discs contain not only Bruch's three symphonies, but also his Romanze in A Minor, Op. 42; Adagio appasionato, Op. 57; In Memoriam, Op. 65; and Konzertst&uuml;ck in F sharp minor, Op. 84. Yet nobody's complaining, for it is largely via these pieces that Bruch's mastery with strings shines so brilliantly.<br /><br />The symphonies are another matter. Those not familiar with Bruch might well use the Brahms symphonies as a reference point, from which one can then move on to mark the significant differences between the two composers.<br /><br />Bruch's symphonies are sonorous and profoundly moving, a kind of German varietal linked horizontally at some deep level to the tonal palate of an English composer like Vaughan Williams.<br /><br />This is very fine music. Bruch's symphonies are not Brahms, either in shape or in quality. Yet they are 'Brahmsian', if one may coin an adjective to indicate a master's less gifted but honorable disciple.<br /><br />It is while listening through the pieces for violin and orchestra that a reviewer wonders how he could have stumbled erect thus far through life without having known this splendid beauty. An album with *only* Bruch's symphonies would be a workhorse piece of the library with little threat of keeping one up late into the morning, listening. An album of Bruch's symphonies *and* these that feature Accardo's violin in front of an exceptionally well-led Gewandhausorchester Leipzig is another matter. Threatening, indeed.ewandhausorchester Leipzig is another matter. Threatening, indeed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I watched the first disc as a rental... We liked it so much that we decided to purchase the whole series.  Just loved the whole thing.  Now we have also purchased the movie that was done after the series, which is \\"Serenity[[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]]\\".  Haven't watching it yet but if it is anything like the series, we will enjoy it just as much.  This is a set we will watch many times as you always see something you missed.  The characters are great and it is well acted and put together. We highly recommend it..
1582701709|2.0|It was an ok book.  I'm not sure what I was expecting.  It basically said what a lot of other self help books have said, just in a different way.

I had read that they would give higher output when driven by low power headphone amps but I still had to go with a different headphone amplifier set-up to get sufficient volume.  A high quality product (not made in PRC!).  I like the collapsible design and replaceable cable feature.

B000957O7S|5.0|Great Lovable Family Movie about love, life and the ups and downs between men and women.  I've seen this move 50 times and I'll see it 50 more.  Absolutely  Fantastic!
B00005JPFF|4.0|The film has been criticized for being too interested in saving the characters' souls - essentially the criticism is that the film is too religious.  I don't mind the strong moral themes because I've always been drawn to mythological and super hero stories because they aspire to touch on great moral and \\"religious\\" questions.  So I don't fault the movie for trying to bite off more than it could chew.  However, unfortunately this movie is not as easy to swallow as the previous two.<br /><br />Church's appearance and physical presence are great for Sandman, but the lines of dialogue he is given are a little bit too much one note over and over again.  Topher plays Venom very well, with great charm and panache.  Jameson and his staff's reparte are excellent as always.  Campbell's comic relief scene as a French waiter is pitch perfect again.  Stan Lee's cameo is always appreciated.  Franco's acting is always a little cagey, but he's asked to play improbable emotional arcs, so like Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars' prequels, you kind of have to tip your hat to both actors for trying to make something out of the sometimes humorously overwrought and implausible roles they have been given.<br /><br />Maquire and Dunst have proven to be perfect casting and are strong as always.  But Mary Jane's role is written a little too \\"Damsel in distress\\" and too imperceptive for modern sensibilities.<br /><br />The action scenes suffer from a sense of \\"Matrix\\" 2 & 3 style overload in that they are very well done, but not novel (but at least they are not all in monochromatic Matrix green tones).  The person I saw it with said, \\"How many times can someone land on a their back on a steel beam?\\"  My other criticism of the action scenes is that they are done in low light and at night too often.  And even though there is a lot of fast action, it's almost too fast to fully appreciate the fighting decision making (kind of like watching a martial arts film that just keeps fighting & fighting superfast with little ingenuity, or like the lightsaber fights in Star Wars Episode III).  However, the crane action scene was novel and spectacular.<br /><br />Before the movie came out, fans were already criticizing trying to fit 3 villains into one movie, and the movie does run long.  The editors should have cut the Jameson \\"Little girl, can I buy your camera scene?\\" because it deflated the tension build up and wasn't that funny - if they were really trying to build up to an emotional release (a little too much like the many Tim Burton mistakes with the Batman franchise).  Editorially, we could have done without the news anchor and reporter lady 'commenting on the obvious' during the final battle scene.  Scriptwriting - we could have found a better pretext for the Venom power transfering from Peter Parker to Eddie Brock, instead of \\"Oh wow, what a coincidence you were here when I was there.\\"  In a city of 10 million people, what were the odds?<br /><br />A primary theme of this movie was a redo of the excellently executed theme in Spiderman 2.  But we've already been convinced that one man can make a difference and that everybody always has a choice whether to fight for good or to not fight.  So thematically, it was too much of a redo, with added, heavy handed emphasis on forgiveness (which wraps up the story a little too sugary for modern viewers).  Like most American movies, the heroes overcome their enemies in this film by killing them.  For the movie to have packed more of a relevant punch, more of the villains should have survived, continuing their never ending menace.<br /><br />The movie and Raimi must be commended for doing the following very well: The movie reminds us there would be no Spiderman if there had been no Aunt May.  She is Peter Parker's moral compass.  She is a beautiful, archetypal model of a feminine conscience in a masculine hero (a theme also emphasized well in movies like The Bourne Supremacy).  She not only inspired him to become a hero, but also her presence and influence will always be regularly needed to help Peter find his way.become a hero, but also her presence and influence will always be regularly needed to help Peter find his way.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I sent it to my daughter who is lives and works in Singapore. I live in Milan, Italy.  We both love it!!  I had to send it to her as she doesn't have a tv at home and I don't know if there's Gilmore Girls series on the tv there. I watch here in Italy but unfortunately they don't show chronologically but sporadically in 3 segments from different seasons (1, 2 and sometimes 3, I guess). Love it very much as it reminds so much of my relation with my daughter. <br /> <br />I'm addicted to it.  I love every show.  But I had to start with season 1 for my daughter where I already reached season 2 here in Italy. <br /> <br />Very sweet storyline.  Love Lauralai and Rory.  But I wish Lauralai would not be so antagonistic towards her mother and her mother would not be so detached and cold to her in return.  That's the only dissappointment I have in this tv series.   <br />Will save money to buy the whole series up to season 6 if possible. <br />Thank you.

B000M3452Y|4.0|Many music critics have accredited bands like The Killers to bringing back the retro sounds of the '80s.  While The Killers infuse elements of retro, they're too mainstream and clean to really be compared to bands like The Cure, Depeche Mode, and New Order.  Bands that redefined electronic music, that wore makeup and died their hair black, yet weren't afraid to write silly lyrics.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the true \\"retro band of the '00s:\\" LCD Soundsystem! <br /> <br />Not all of the tracks on this 9-track album are authentically retro, and that's just as well - if they were simply focusing all their energy on mimicking an older sound, no one would care.  But they do have a sound all their own, a sound one might hear if Franz Ferdinand decided to collaborate with Robert Smith, which so far hasn't happened, making this sound unique ;)  It's dance rock fused with dance techno, tongue-in-cheek lyrics coupled with a thumping base and repetitive yet inspired chords. <br /> <br />The best track is by far... a tie actually :)  Between two completely different songs: the lackadaisical North American Scum (a better radio-friendly song would be difficult to find), and its polar opposite (and, ironically, the next track on the album), the perfect '80s gem Someone Great.  I've played both of them on my radio show, I'll play the again and again, switching off, until people tell me to stop.  They're that good. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is fairly good too, but not nearly to the degree of the above 2.  Time to Get Away is another easy radio hit, one you could introduce people to this album and get them hooked on.  Some of the tracks near the end such as Us vs. Them and Watch the Tapes get very very repetitive, to the point where they certainly don't need to be over 5 minutes long each, but if you overlook the repetition they're still quite enjoyable.  And then there's the closer, New York I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down, a huge title for an impish little bit of poetry.  Tongue-in-cheek poetry of course, and possibly the best lyrical track on the album. <br /> <br />Overall this album isn't perfect: some tracks are too long, there aren't enough tracks total, some tracks will get annoying fast, other tracks won't stick in your memory (the purely instrumental ones mostly).  But if you want to take a trip back to when Star Wars was still \\"good\\" and some of the best music came from white nerds on their keyboards... then this is your ticket.
0385312083|1.0|Slaughterhouse 5 tells of the treatment and conditions of American prisoners of war at the end of WWII.  It also follows the life of Billy Pilgram, one of these POWs at other times in his life.  Billy believes himself able to time travel and believes that he was once abducted by aliens that studied him as well as the other Earthlings they periodically capture.  Because of his time traveling abilities as well as the insights that the aliens imparted on his life, he knows how his life will be long before he actually experiences it.  Much of his life is shaped by his experiences as a POW and war time is a period that he frequently revisits during time travel. <br /> <br />Not only did I have trouble and frustration with the plot of the story, I simply did not enjoy the writing style.  I found the constant use of the phrase \\"So it goes\\" to be distracting and annoying.  It is never clear whether the reader is to believe that Billy can actually time travel or whether he is completely out of his mind.  At times it seems as though his inventive memory is completely influenced by things he has read or seen and that this is simply his reaction to dementia.  Other portions of the book leave the reader thinking that it is possible that he has powers that others do not.  Either way, it makes for a confusing and disjointed story that is not particularly enjoyable.  It is a novel that is ripe for discussion in a high school or college lit class that will excite the professor and utterly confuse and bore the student.
B000N3ST8Y|2.0|The remaster job on the album is superb.  This in one of the Depeche Mode albums that may not have aged has well as the others but, hearing it again and with the DVD documentary sheds new light on a oft-overlooked masterpiece.  My main complaint on this and all of the Depeche Mode Remasters is important songs like Get the Balance Right, Love Itself 4 and the Everything Counts (in larger amounts) are not on the CD because when they were originally released they were not on the album.  So they are bonus tracks on the DVD.  But not on the CD.  Leaving the fans to have to either go by the regular US editions with the bonus tracks or get the six different singles collections box sets which are only about $50 each.  It's a long long way for the Depeche Mode completist who sold their original US editions in eager anticipation of the remasters only to be burned by having to spend more money to obtain some of the best songs.  Don't even get me started on the Remastered Black Celebration without \\"But Not Tonight...\\"  Summary Excellent content, but just like many of these Deluxe editions (i.e. Flaming Lips) so can't hear any of the B Sides or songs once included on the US editions on the CD.  You gotta listen sitting at home through your DVD player at home on the TV.....at home....BOOOOOOOOOOO.!!!!  Shame Shame.

B00005JPLU|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this sorry excuse for what should have been a great film. If you want to understand what really happened with the 300 and the other Greeks at this battle watch \\"The 300 Spartans\\" OR the History Channels documentaries about the 300 Spartans instead. They are available from Amazon and are much better. Spartans were very proud fighters and were extremely proud of their armor. They didn't fight half naked without their breastplates. Zerkes didn't have a bunch of pearls and such hanging off his face and didn't go around half naked either. The Greeks and Persians were proud people. To display them as was done in this film is a disgrace. The fight scenes look like they came from Matrix or another world.

0743496728|5.0|I happened to be right in the middle of reading this book during the unfortunate events at Virginia Tech.   Ms. Picoult's description of the pain, isolation and alienation felt by the character in her book, heightened my ability to comprehend a real life shooter, such as Mr. Cho of VT. The book helped me comprehend, not understand or excuse the rationale for retaliating against innocent young people to assuage the \\"pain\\" experienced by the shooter.   <br /> <br />Excellent writing, once again, by Ms. Picoult.   She obviously needed to distance herself in time from the Columbine shooters to examine the serious problems that would lead a young man to enter a school with guns and take aim at his peers.  Yet, Ms. Picoult surely could never have predicted the actions of someone like Mr. Cho at Virginia Tech.   Society needs not to walk away from the events at Virginia Tech, Columbine or other schools that experience this kind of violence without a way to prevent this from happening in the future.  Nineteen Minutes was a study of the kind of mind set in a young person, who would resort to violence to end his own personal hell in school. <br /> <br />Tammy, Marietta GA
B000HBK3MM|4.0|A great CD for those quiet, mellow moments. Perfect while sharing a bottle of fine wine. A+++
B00004DTLJ|5.0|Saxon are barely a footnote in the US despite their being a perennial favorite in Britain and Europe to this day.  The band, like all metal bands who've been around a while has its weaker moments, and especially strong.  \\"Innocence Is No Excuse\\" is one of the most powerful and best produced albums of the earlier days, and should have been a classic in league with \\"Back In Black\\", \\"British Steel\\" or \\"The Number Of The Beast\\".  Instead, one can only find it as a special order import, but it's worth the search.<br /><br />  Saxon easily bridged the gap between loud rock n' roll ala AC/DC and all out metal, like its brethren Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.  On \\"Innocence\\", the rock and roll face shines throughout with great loud duel guitar by Graham Oliver and mainstay Paul Quinn, impassioned vocals by Biff Byford and tunes that are mid-tempo and full of hooks that should have propelled these guys to headliner status.<br /><br />  Let's be glad, however, that Saxon's underground US audience and rabid European following have allowed them to stay in business and continue to release new material as tough and heavy as anything on the shelf.  \\"The Inner Sanctum\\", the newest CD, is a fine addition to the catalogue.  For those who miss the age of early '80's metal, that brief time before glam posuers from LA took over, and thrash was still in its diapers, \\"Innocence Is No Excuse\\" is a must have.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|After almost three decades of ear time, it would be impossible to displace a classic like Moving Pictures from the top slot, but Snakes and Arrows (weird title) is a very solid effort. The songs are strong all the way through. Alex managed to change his sound A LOT without losing that essential Lerxst-ness us guitar player fans know and love. He mostly plays Gibsons into tube amps, no effects, and a lot of acoustic. Geddy is solid on bass (what did you expect?) and his vocals really work quite nicely, though they took me a bit to get used to. Neil's drumming is a bit simpler sounding than in the past, but in a good way that leaves some more space in the material. His lyrics are dark, mostly being reflections on faith and war, in particular making it in a world full of faiths you don't share that's plagued by war and all sorts of bad stuff. This isn't really new for terrain for Rush, though, since most of the scifi the band was famous for went out back in the early 80s. Nonetheless, Neil seems to put it together in a way that the rawer songs on Vapor Trails didn't manage. I give a lot of credit to producer Nick Raskulinecz (who previously worked with Foo Fighters), who pushed the band to strip things down and get back to the 70s in a good way. (Of course, I credit the band for having the wisdom to know they needed to hire a producer to push them.) For instance, recording took 12 days total, from an interview I read with Alex, amazingly short in this day and age. Unlike Vapor Trails---which sounded muddy to me---production is nice and clean, with instruments inhabiting their own distinct sonic space.

B000002O51|5.0|A successful lawsuit against CBS records and two mediocre recordings from Boston alumnus Barry Gourdreau later, Tom Scholz and Brad Delp stormed back onto the 1986 singles chart with Amanda, Third Stage's first single and lead off song.  It took seven years to get this album released, but the delay was worth it, 40 minutes of beautifully crafted pop-rock, from Amanda's opening chords on the acoustic guitar to the soaring electric on Cool the Engines to the elegiac finale of Hollyann.  If you want to purchase only essential Boston material, get Third Stage plus the first two albums and you'll have the absolute best of Boston - or anyone even remotely associated with Boston.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|The Australian actor Heath Ledger stars in this delightful nonsense, supposedly chronicling the exploits of a young Casanova in Venice during the eighteenth century. It's impossible to take seriously this costume farce, but it is great fun nonetheless. Outrageously, the movie ends up (spoiler included here) with Casanova settling down and discovering the joys of monogamy. A bonus: Jeremy Irons, who that same year played another period Venetian (Antonio) in The Merchant of Venice, here camps it up as an inquisitor who will stop at nothing until he captures Casanova (the constant mockery of the Catholic Church ends up being a little tiresome, though). Oliver Platt, playing a morbidly obese romantic rival of Casanova is very funny; less accomplished is Sienna Miller's performance as Casanova's love interest and a very improbable proto feminist. But the real star of the movie might be Venice itself, shown here as never before, a splendid feast to the eyes. And who knew that an all-out loud baroque soundtrack could be so cinematic. <br />
1400063515|5.0|This book is the best book on philosophy that I have read since Hume. Indeed, the book, like Hume's philosophical writings, is informal. Nevertheless its erudition is prodigious, as indeed is the intellect of its author. The book also contains a half-decent introduction to Levy statistics and similar processes. As I discovered, in physics, the uselessness of Gaussian random processes in the theory of spectroscopy forty years ago, it was a shock to realise that my pension fund is probably managed by people who regard Gaussian processes as an a priori given. <br /> <br />Nassim Taleb's book is amusing, or perhaps droll, as well as profound and erudite, and his stories of growing up in Lebanon into the beginning of the civil war there are fascinating. <br /> <br />A book not to be missed.

0553296981|5.0|i first read this book when i was 14-15, and i just finished reading it again at age 32 and i throughly enjoyed it.  Anne Frank was someone who was a deep thinker who discussed subjects like: politics, love, nature, death, philosophy, human nature and history.  She gives very accurate details of what life was like for her and her family in Nazi-controlled Amsterdam.  The restrictions placed on Jewish people and she even describes the heart pounding day her family decided to leave for the 'secret annexe.' How quiet they have to be and to never go outdoors for the next 25 months. I am still in awe of what an intelligent and deep thinker Anne Frank was, for example on p. 263, she even says 'in spite of everything, i still believe that people are really good at heart'.  This from the young girl who heard planes bombings above her head sometimes on a daily basis...i plan to visit the Anne Frank house sometime in the future and i recommend this book to everyone!!!  Anne Frank was one of millions of victims of the holocaust but still believed in the good of all people.  Still a terrific read after all these years...

B000N4SHPS|4.0|Rocky Balboa is a surprisingly good and touching movie and is very reminiscent of the original Rocky film from 1976. Though many may argue this is a just another predictable Rocky movie, I feel that Stallone has redeemed himself here and has made a fitting farewell to his most famous and enduring character.    In my opinion the acting, writing and directing are all top notch, and this film is so much more realistic than the last two Rocky movies. Stallone looks much older in this film and he's quite believable as an aging \\"has been\\" former champ.    This film is arguably one of the best in the series and it's my personal second favorite after the classic orginal. Rocky is part of American pop culture now and this film is a wonderful ending to this series. If you're not a Rocky fan to begin with, it would be pointless for you to even watch this movie. But if you are a fan, you won't be disappointed.     PS to Mr.Stallone: Please end the Rocky series here on this very high note and don't be tempted to make yet another Rocky sequel!    Mike
1401302378|5.0|This book is extremely well-written and provides a good analysis of the current Internet-driven new economy for niches. For people who have actively been using the WWW for the last 10 years, everything in this book will be clear and intuitive: more content and goods are being produced to fill niches; digital delivery reduces the warehouse and delivery costs; and tools to find desired contents allows users to get the goods that fit them better. If you are a regular Amazon user, then you know this to be 100% true. I've been led to excellent products I would otherwise never have found if not for Amazon's recommendation engine and user reviews. <br /> <br />Here are some points the author does not explore: (1) The author says that recommendations and filters are what drive consumers to the niche products, but what if these recommendations are subverted for commercial gain? Worse, what if there is absolutely no trust in the recommendations? (2) The absolute best form of niche content is news, with the current state-of-the-art in recommendation-driven news being websites such as Slashdot and Digg. The author does not explore this aspect of niche content.  <br /> <br />Note to the author: a bit does not comprise ones and twos. <br /> <br />Excellent book overall. Highly recommended if you are active in WWW culture.

I'm surprised that they let two nobody writers take charge of America's greatest hero. They obviously had no concept of the character or else they wouldn't have had to borrow so much from previous material, especially since there is such a wealth of material out there.

1400044162|4.0|Highly recommended!<br /><br />Strip away the thin veneer of civilization, and history teaches that you can quickly fall into savagery.  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie disagrees with that conclusion.  She sees elemental nobility in people that overcomes for most even the most trying conditions.  As a result, Half of a Yellow Sun is a very hopeful work, despite recounting the horrors of the Biafran attempt to separate from Nigeria in 1967-70.  She also realizes that even the best people will slip up . . . and deserve forgiveness when they do if they repent.<br /><br />However, betray someone at a personal level . . . and that's much harder to take than mere life-threatening and degrading challenges.  The contrast between surviving external conditions and personal betrayal is deftly and powerfully made in this kaleidoscope of how world politics, colonial policies, religious differences, tribal influences, geographical prejudices, racism, economic class consciousness, business activities, family connections, friendships, sexual desire, obligations, and personal favors interplay.<br /><br />At the center of the story is one household at rural Nsukka University comprised of the socialist-leaning professor Odenigbo, his beautiful mistress Olanna, daughter of Chief Ozobia, and their houseboy, Ugwu.  The plot also heavily involves Olanna's fraternal twin sister, Kainene, who runs the family business interests and her lover, the ineffectual English writer, Richard Churchill. Intellectuals from Odenigbo's university circles also stand-in as surrogates for various attitudes in society.  In fact, each character is clearly symbolic of one part of the story or the other.  Follow their fates, and you get a good sense of the author's ideas of what happened to the overall social fabric.<br /><br />Two things make this book special:  First, Ms. Adichie has captured the psychologies of different times in Nigeria and Biafra in a subtle and interesting way.  Her book is very much more about the psychological landscape than about the physical one.  No doubt she was helped by her interviews with her relatives and others still living who experienced those days.  Second, she takes the time to endow ordinary life with extraordinary meaning.  It's a beautiful gift.<br /><br />The book has two weaknesses from my perspective:  Ms. Adichie curiously decides to turn some of the personal events into a mystery so that for some pages you see characters estranged from one another . . . but without knowing the reason.  I felt like this approach simply served to make the story harder to understand . . . as though the reader didn't really qualify to know family matters.  The other weakness is that many characters are drawn very superficially while Ms. Adichie shows enormous skill in portraying great depths concerning Olanna, Ugwu, and Odenigbo.<br /><br />For those of us who don't live in Africa, it's always exciting to see events there from the perspective of Africans . . . rather than American journalists and visiting politicians.  I felt deeply rewarded by reading this fine book.ore about the psychological landscape than about the physical one.

B000MV9026|2.0|I really didn't like this movie, neither did anyone else we watched it with, including the kids.  There is not a lot there for kids once the cutesy animation wears off.  You have the same old story of an outcast who ultimately saves the day in the end but it is a long time before you get to that point.  There are some funny moments in the film and some cute acting but not a lot of it is really age-appropriate for young kids and the movie is too shallow to hold older audiences.  My real complaint with the movie is that it comes across as just a thinly-veiled attempt to get an environmentalist message across.  Unfortunately, it fails because the parents see right through it and the children are too young to understand it.

B00005JPO8|5.0|\\"The lives of others\\" (= \\"Das leben der anderen\\") is a wonderful film directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, that won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Truth to be told, I hadn't heard his name before, but I'm certain that I won't forget it now. This film, his debut as a director, is simply exceptional. An engaging political thriller, this movie is at the same time a complex study regarding the power of choices, and the way we behave when faced to our worst fears.<br /><br />The story is set in East Germany in 1984, when the lack of freedom and the zeal of the Secret Police (Stasi) were pervasive. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he) is an agent that specializes in discovering \\"traitors\\", that is, those that don't agree with everything that the government says. Wiesler is very good at his job, and has no mercy for those that don't add up to his ideal of what a good socialist should be.<br /><br />That is probably the reason why his superior assigns him the task of of spying on Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a well-known socialist playwright that is nonetheless suspicious, due to his friends. Dreyman lives with his girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a talented actress that loves him but has sexual trysts with a powerful government official that promises her that she will never be in the black list of artist that cannot work.<br /><br />As Wiesler learns more about the couple, thanks to the hidden microphones his team installed in their apartment, he starts warming towards them. He even protects them when Dreyman becomes actively involved in \\"subversive\\" activities, as a reaction to the suicide of a friend that had been blacklisted. But how far will Wiesler risk himself? And can human beings really change?<br /><br />Strangely enough, \\"The lives of others\\" tackles those difficult questions in a manner that leaves nothing to be desired, and makes you think almost involuntarily about many more that have to do with them. On the whole, I must say that I cannot recommend this film strongly enough.  Please don't miss it...<br /><br />Belen Alcat, May 2007lm strongly enough.  Please don't miss it...    Belen Alcat, May 2007
B00004S875|4.0|I would have to disagree with the reviews on the 5.1 multichannel not being as good as \\"The Stranger\\" SACD release. It's it's equal easily. <br />The real issue is that \\"The Stranger\\" is just a better album to listen to.  <br /> <br />52nd Street loses it it's strength after the Stilleto track and Stranger on whole is stronger from start to finish. Hence my 4 star rating versus the 5 I gave to Stranger in SACD. <br /> <br /> <br />Differences here for 52nd to a normal cd: <br />1) entire album sounds better. I never really liked Zanzibar, but changed <br />my mind after hearing this. <br /> <br />2) stand out tracks: Honesty (Vocal is exceptional on this one), Zanzibar(you can hear all the instruments finally), Stilleto (still think the Kohlept version is best though, it's got more kick and he seems to nail the feeling right) <br /> <br />Definitely worth buying. <br /> <br />Not worth buying, \\"Innocent Man\\" on SACD. <br />(straight Stereo dump to SACD, no multichannel. Sounds like a regular CD) <br /> <br />

1582701709|5.0|We've all heard the expression, \\"you are what you eat,\\" but in \\"The Secret,\\" Rhonda Byrne brings together a collection of fascinating leaders/experts in all areas of personal growth to explain and explore the many facets of the law of attraction. This \\"law\\" basically says you are what you think: whatever shows up in your life, you attract it through your thoughts. The book talks about how even things that seem like permanent fixtures in our lives - like not having enough money, attracting types of people you don't like, bad health, etc. - can be positively affected by how you hold them in your mind. Some of the stories they tell as examples of this are really amazing. It's a wild concept to see how much we are actually in control of our lives.     I was first introduced to the idea of watching my thoughts and becoming aware of them through another incredible book, [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]] by Ariel & Shya Kane. Though this book has a different focus (the Kanes book explores more about 'being', while \\"The Secret\\" focuses more on 'thinking'), there are so many wonderful parallels between the two. I don't read a lot of personal growth books, but these two books have had a huge impact on my life, and I strongly recommend each of them. They both present very real, incredibly powerful possibilities for experiencing a quality of life that most of us think is impossible. Even if you have doubts or think this stuff only works for other people, do yourself a favor and buy these books - they can change your life!

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush fans, rejoice.  Judging by the numerous other reviews (with the occasional hiccup), most of you already are.  Here is a superb new album from a legendary rock band who have managed to maintain freshness, vigor and originality for over 30 years now.  This new album is yet another intriguing chapter in a fascinating canon of great, aggressive rock music.   <br /> <br />Rush ought to be congratulated by fans worldwide for putting forth such a spirited and focused recording, and they ought to be respected by all up and coming bands with any interest whatsoever in writing and executing sophisticated rock music.  Although they have long been the targets of music 'critics', most notably Rolling Stone, this album proves once again that when you ignore your critics and challenge yourself you can achieve genuine artistic integrity and have a good time doing it.  This is a fun, hard album that will make you pound your fists and shake your feet.   <br /> <br />This is not a perfect record, but for me the five stars is awarded for the aggressive and constantly interesting arrangements, the outstanding production by Nick Raskulinecz, and the obvious spirit and heart these men have put into these songs.  What the songs lack in lush tones, vocal prowess, or modern bells & whistles they more than make up for in their tight, crisp musical performances and their nuanced rhythms and structures.   <br /> <br />Each song is worth poring over for the music and the overall energy.  I won't run them all down.  Each musician here shines, and they each show more restraint than may be expected for a Rush record.  With his extraordinary bass playing skills you can never blame Geddy Lee for competing equally with Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson, but here he reigns it in just enough to provide an absolutely perfect combination of his aggressive style and superb foundational playing.  Neil Peart is an absolutely phenomenal drummer, as we all know, and what I like about his performance here is theprecision and mature restraint rather than going overboard.  I have never minded when he let it fly either, but you do experience an appreciation for those virtuosos who know exactly how the instruments should be played in the appropriate moments.  Neil and Geddy's jamming during the guitar solo for 'The Main Monkey Business' should make all Rush fans exalt.  This is what Rush has always done so well for so long.  If you can listen to that whole song without playing air-something, you have a great deal of restraint yourself.   <br /> <br />Special props are due for Alex Lifeson in my opinion who has delivered a wonderfully colorful performance on the guitar on \\"Snakes & Arrows\\".  He has always had a unique style but here he has clearly driven many of the compositions and, in my mind, he has re-invented the guitar solo with some of his beautiful gems here.  The solo has been a largely dead form for years now and to my ears Alex has reclaimed it as a form and an art.  He has not always been my favorite member of Rush but he has done a service to all Rush fans here by envigorating this record and taking a leadership position in their newest material.   <br /> <br />Lyrically I do find Neil's quasi-relgisious humanistics to be slightly trite and sometimes almost cliche.  This will be a sin to proclaim to many Rush lyrical afficianados, but that's how I feel.  Nonetheless I respect his views and I give him credit for attempting to lay them out in these songs.  I don't agree with them but I don't begrudge him for them.  He's honest and he's cultured, and he's been through a lot.  I don't love the lyrics here but they do not take away from the accomplishment of this record, they are simply a matter of taste.  His songs have been a big part of my life for years, and I am grateful for them all.   <br /> <br />In sum:  a superb, spirited album from a great, great rock band that deserves accolades for their longevity and creativity.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008O89K|5.0|Among others, I miss Bail Poledouris also.  \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" is an outstanding soundtrack.  I also have the \\"Varese\\" edition, I bought it back in the 90's for $11.99.<br /><br />My only complaint:  If you remember the scene just before Conan kills the giant snake, he stumbles onto that jade copy of Thulsa Doom's \\"two snakes\\" symbol and freezes for a few seconds (just before the female sacrifice jumps in), that violin passage was the best part of the movie for me (it lasted maybe one minute!).  I wish that violin solo was on the soundtrack, but, alas, no such luck!<br /><br />Still, the soundtrack garners '5' stars from me...
B000002HMH|2.0|I will keep this simple. Metallica still shows decent musicianship, but no balls, no passion no real OOMPH. I love all kinds of music and I dont just hate the change in musical direction. Its a little deeper than that. Just listen to the first disc of Garage days especially the songs that were the 5.98 E.P. revisited. This is the music they cut theyre teeth on the music that helped them define theyre own sound and intensity. When you listen to most of the newer stuff it is clear that they are what, wimping out getting old who knows all I know Is I have been playing Guitar for over 17 years and I do listen to loads of music but my first loves are metal and punk and I cant see that ever changing.

1416524800|3.0|A NASA Earth observation spacecraft has spotted a meteorite in the Arctic that turns out to contain fossils. Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton is sent off by the president to help investigate, along with Carl Sagan successor Michael Tolland. But all is not as it seems, as apparently some people don't want too close a look at the meteorite and are willing to kill to prevent same.<br /><br />The book takes a long time to get going, not getting really interesting until around page 350, when Rachel communicates her growing skepticism to a White House advisor and is accused of playing politics when she's actually being sincere. From that point on, it gets entertainingly difficult to figure out what's really going on and who the good guys really are (though since one side consistently suffers grisly deaths, such as being eaten by sharks, it's not that hard after a while).<br /><br />More of the usual inaccuracies: one of the key plot points turns on a software error onboard the Earth observation mission which somehow can't be fixed by a simple software upload (a capability built into almost every satellite) but requires a shuttle servicing mission, even though it's a polar mission and the shuttle can't fly into such orbits. And Dan Brown doesn't seem to like NASA much, though he provides respectable justification for doing so.

The girls in Casino Royale <br />seem to be a bit short of beauty too...maybe I am being cynical...but then that isn't what made Casino Royale the hit movie to me. There was an <br />excellent amount of action and drama to keep it moving. Not as many gizmos <br />as I hoped for like in Goldfinger, but enough to sustain the tech era. <br />Speaking of ugly...the villan was really a trip as far as the torture scene...yikes...anybody watching had to hold their breath a little during <br />that sequence.

032147404X|5.0|I have recently been introduced to Scott and his approach to photography and writing.  I must say that his style is welcomed and refreshing!  <br /> <br />So many other writers get involved in esoteric and highly embellished verbiage that it's difficult to get to the core of what they are attempting to say.  <br /> <br />I admit that at times Scott's humor is a bit overdone, to the point of obnoxiousness, but with the understanding that every person has their faults, I'll take his style of writing any day! <br /> <br />This book is direct, to the point and gives the essentials needed to get the job done right in as little space as possible. It's amazing how quickly one can get through the book. Scott waists no time on triviality (other than an occasional dry joke). He says what is necessary and avoids the endless and worthless details that others add just to fill the pages to make a longer book and try to justify  charging more money.  <br /> <br />This is the second book of Scott's that I have and  admittedly I am now a loyal fan of his style. I highly recommend this book, although it is likely best suited for the beginner/intermediate or demented-advanced user.  <br /> <br />Enjoy!

1594200823|5.0|This book takes us on a journey from the origin of humankind to the present. He clearly places humans as animals alongside other animals, and speculates on how our omnivorous nature has played out in our cultures across time, and especially in today's United States.  This is the backdrop for specific investigations the author explores.  <br /> <br />These investigations are varied. Some are social inquiries, others look into business or farming practices. Ultimately, the inquiry becomes one author's personal experience, a form nature writing often takes. He does not condemn, except where careful description by itself condemns. He does not ultimately take a stand. He attempts to show us the multiple simultaneous paths individual and groups have taken that have resulted in today's reality - a reality which still includes not only mega-farming, but also occasionally permaculture farming, and the lone hunter.  <br /> <br />Entire books could be written about almost any of the subjects covered, some in passing, some with at least a chapter. But this book is not about thoroughly explicating any one facet of the encounter we modern Americans have with food. It's about stitching all those facets together, presenting such seemingly disparate events as mushroom hunting and feeding corn products to cows, and creating a linked story. Human beings have always been able to eat a variety of foods. But how, given our early ancestors foraging on berries and bones alike, did we arrive at the oddity and lack of variety of the foodstuffs we consume today?
0060755598|4.0|This CD set gives a good perspective about how to make a business work.  Some of the philisophical stuff in the middle of this set is off - but other than that, it has a lot of good ideas and nuggets.  I'd recommend combining Gerber's ideas with other good business authors, like Lencioni.

1582701709|1.0|This repackaged, new-age drivel is so absurd I can't even begin to refute it. The popularity of such utter nonsense is testament to how badly people want to believe something - anything. This is religion without even the pretense of a story. If you think Scientology is a joke (it is), this is even worse. Why can't people just accept that the world is the way it is, and that it doesn't revolve around your petty wants?

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|There sure was a lot of controversy surrounding The Passion of the Christ when it was released back in 2004.<br /><br />After finally viewing the movie this past weekend, I can certainly see why the movie is deeply upsetting...especially to all that believe that Jesus was The Messiah. The Passion portrays Christ's death as one of the most brutal I have ever seen in any movie, and I've watched a lot of modern day TV & film with some ugly death scenes...including HBO's Rome that suggests it was a pretty barbaric time in the hundred or so years Before and After Christ.<br /><br />Perhaps the interpretation that Christ's death was so horrifying was \\"controversial\\" to some because they'd have preferred a depiction of a \\"kinder, gentler\\" murder of Jesus. I'd therefore have to go with \\"deeply upsetting\\" versus \\"controversial\\" when asked about the violence in this movie.<br /><br />The other word-of-mouth controversy that I heard about regarding this movie was that the Jewish community was angry because The Passion depicted Jews as cruel and savage. On the contrary...Jews were depicted no more uncivilized than others living in the period. If fact, according to The Passion it apparently wasn't even the Jews that directly murdered Jesus; Jewish priests did have him arrested. But ultimately--according to the canonical Christian Gospel that the The Passion clearly based a lot of its story from--it was Pontius Pilate (the governor of Roman Judea) that presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion. Hence, it was the Romans that carried out a death sentence and did most of the actual torturing and crucifying.<br /><br />Therefore, as for controversial....I say, what's all the hub-bub, Bub?<br /><br />As for the movie...it was extremely powerful. Informational...educational even. The film's dialogue is in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew, with subtitles. And do indeed watch it with the subtitles; watching in the native languages adds a whole degree of reality to a movie that already comes off as very believable.<br /><br />The acting is first class. James Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus is burned onto my memory. There are many aspects to this movie that I will not soon forget.

1582701709|2.0|Just a collection of pop sayings to effect a positive attitude. Nothing really indepth or startling. Okay for those looking for a bandaid approach-or those who prefer to avoid real reading-unfortunately nothing in this book provides any real guidance or direction. Disappointing.
B00004VYH1|5.0|<br />I knew this was a foreign-produced DVD but didn't know it was Korean, and debated between this and what turns out to be a Chinese version. I chose this one but didn't notice the misspelling of \\"EL\\" on the cover. (It must be a misspelling and not French because it is correct on the edge of the case and on the DVD itself. I know a little bit of the Korean language, having spent a year there in the service, and the Korean phonetic spelling on the cover is \\"el\\". <br /> <br />I saw this movie when it was a first-run in the theatre where I worked in 1961. I watched it over and over because I thought it was great then and still do. This DVD is not a bad reproduction of the original film. The color is not quite as rich, but it seems to add to the medieval setting of the story. Although it is only stereo, the sound is good on my 6.1 surround. It does have a \\"Dolby Digital\\" trademark on it, for what that's worth. One minor annoying thing is the default for the Korean subtitles is the \\"ON\\" position, so you have to turn them off manually each time you view it. <br /> <br />I had put this movie in my Amazon alerts about four years ago and got nothing, apparently because the studio decided not to reproduce it domestically in DVD. I don't know if the one by Golden Classic Collectibles is foreign or domestic, but another reviewer for the Chinese DVD mentioned that it's possible the studio wanted to avoid a possible controversy because of the obvious jihad plot. \\"Allah has commanded us to rule the world,\\" is the opening line, spoken by the leader of the Moors, and it plays out throughout the movie. <br /> <br />Based on the reviews of the Chinese version, I would recommend this one. As far as the Golden Classic Collectibles version is concerned, I've never bought any of theirs, but in any event, the difference between it and this Korean one could not possibly be worth $20. <br />
B00068TJM6|4.0|I am learning to fly and to celebrate the fact that I passed all theoretical exams I wanted to buy a 'real' aviation watch. <br /> <br />The 411 seemed to offer good value for money which was the reason to get it.

1582701709|2.0|This book is extremely overrated!  I mean, come on Ms. Byrne, it's no secret that the power of positive thinking can do wonders for all of us.  If we wish hard enough, will we ultimately get what we desire most in life?  NO!  It takes more than that.....hard work, determination, persistence, faith, etc.  Ms. Byrne suggests that we will get what we want out of life by simply thinking hard about it and not letting ANY negative thoughts into our head.  That may be all well and good, but in my humble opinion, it isn't the answer for people who wish to make real change in their lives.  This book is a waste of money and time.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|One of my personal favortie movies. Easily a good watch, even if you don't normally like subtitles. This movie will keep you up at night, asking yourself \\"What if...\\" <br />What if you were forced to kill your entire high school class? what if you watched your best friend die right in front of your face? what would you do? would you run, hide, and wait things out, or would you strategize, fight your friends, or fight the system. <br /> <br />Tatsuya is a phenominal director, and has fantastically created this movie to seem very much like real life, much as was done in 28 Days Later. <br /> <br />The movie is a fantastic display of human nature. everyone has a story. I also highly suggest that you read the book or the manga, as it is far more detailed. <br /> <br />and as for those who have already read the book, you, unfortunately, will be disapointed to find that many parts of the book are summed over. <br />However, Battle Royale is still a fantastic book, and a great dvd with plenty of exciting extras.  <br /> <br />highly suggested

B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile's second CD starts with a song that pretty much positions her for the knowing listener. That is, if you like Melissa Etheridge and Rosanne Cash and Emmylou Harris --- smart, sensitive singer-songwriters who can shout as well as whisper --- you're going to like this singer-songwriter too.<br /><br />That is, she's pleasant. Accomplished. But derivative. And, thus, hardly essential.<br /><br />The second song --- the title song --- begins. It's written by one of the twin brothers who are Carlile's house band. It rocks a little harder, and then, at 2 minutes and 56 seconds, it returns to its opening:<br /><br />All of these lines across my face<br /><br />Tell you the story of who I am<br /><br />So many stories of where I've been<br /><br />And how I got to where I am<br /><br />But these stories don't mean anything<br /><br />When you've got no one to tell them to<br /><br />It's true...I was made for you<br /><br />And as Brandi Carlile delivers those lines, something happens that I can't recall occurring for donkey's years. The singer doesn't \\"sing\\" the first few lines. She explodes out of your speakers. Looks you right in the eye. And flat-out screams.<br /><br />Do you shiver? I did. And I'm the guy who likes a lot of emotion.<br /><br />From there on, Brandi Carlile was as necessary to my life as caffeine. \\"I started losing sleep and gaining weight/And wishing I was ten again/So I could be your friend again.\\" There's stuff like that in every song.<br /><br />Thirteen songs. Love songs, all. If, that is, you define love as living in each other's guts, or trying to get there, or wondering why you're not there any more. I adore authenticity, but this is more of it than I'm used to --- to pay attention to every song on this CD is to be forced to compare Carlile's emotional resources with your own.<br /><br />But this CD is in no way harrowing. Carlile and her friends may slit a vein before they write, but as a piece of music, \\"The Story\\" is very pleasing. For every shout there's a gorgeous trill. For every heavy lyric, there's a clever melody. And for every heartache, there's a notion like \\"Your friends are never gone/if you look to the sky and pray.\\"<br /><br />It is entirely possible to listen to Brandi Carlile and think: up-and comer, pleasant voice, nice songs, great in the car and at parties. I hope I get there soon. For now, at 2:56 of \\"The Story,\\" the world stops and a woman I'll never meet gets in my face to tell me what love costs. And whatever I'm doing, I honor her with my full attention.y shout there's a gorgeous trill. For every heavy lyric, there's a clever melody.

B00005JPFF|3.0|So, I went and watched Spider-man 3 on a midnight show in Miami. I was so exited to see what the movie was going to look like and to my surprise the movie just fell off high expectations. There are so many problems with the movie I don't even know what to start with.  <br /> <br />The movie is difficult to follow. It has so many characters that you get mixed up on which storyline you should follow. The writing wasn't so great either. The Scenes?? Well to tell you the truth, I can not take the good out of a movie just because it was bad, I would say the effect where amazing, clearly better than the ones before, but in the end, effects does not make a movie \\"good\\", there is not one scene that I would say \\"Wow, that was an amazing scene\\". I remember that in Spider-Man 2 the scene where Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are in the coffee shop and Doc Ock throws a car at them, the picture becomes slow motion, Kristen barely touched the car-- there was nothing like this in the picture, nothing worth really watching for, none of the stories really had an end. Everything was just mixed all over the place.  <br /> <br />I hope that if they plan on releasing Spider-man 4, they need to think about it, and if they are going to make it this long, please throw some action at us. I would say stick with the action-packed Spiderman, not with the \\"heart-broken\\" one. If you are a fan, see it just because you have seen Spider-man 1 and 2, but if you are new to this (which might be impossible) don't watch it, I'm telling you, you won't like what you see.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Picked up the new Snakes and Arrows cd the day it was released.  I'm one of those people that, although I love music, and listen to lots of it, all the time, I still usuaully cannot get a feel for an album without a few listens.<br /><br />I just got through listening to the whole thing straight thru while working on the computer, and I have to say...Wow, this is some good stuff!  I have all of Rush's music.  In fact, Farewell to Kings was one of the first albums I ever walked into a record store and bought.  Just for a perspective, I consider Hold Your Fire they're \\"worst album\\".  I liked Vapor Trails for the music, but still don't like the bad sonic properties of the mastering job (Metallica's St. Anger got one listen from me and I shut the door on them).<br /><br />Some people have said that the instrumental The Main Monkey Business just didn't do anything for them?  I think it rocks!  Sure it's not gonna be as exciting as hearing YYZ back when you were in High School and you and all you buddies thought Rush were Gods, but it is the YYZ of Rush in 2007.<br /><br />I have definately been let down by \\"New\\" Rush discs before (Power Windows, Presto, Hold You Fire, etc.) But, this one is so diverse.  It's got that \\"heaviness\\" of Counterparts, with the sprinkling of acoustic guitars reminiscent of Farewell to Kings.  No keyboards.  No Rapping (OK I like Roll the Bones...but). Just really good modern Rock from a very mature and intelligent band.  Four and a half stars actually.

B0000214F0|1.0|Caligula is an utter mess of a film if only for the sole purpose that the possibilities for the concept itself were pretty good ones.  Gaius Caligula Caesar's rise to power and ultimate early fall and assassination is a story worth telling a million times over, especially in the daring form of an X-rated film.  It is a direct warning to the social ills of power in the wrong hands and cultural excess. There seemed to be a superstar lineup for this unique idea.  Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren and John Guilguild are three great actors.  The film is directed by Italy's racy Tinto Brass and produced by the editor of Penthouse Magazine who brought a bunch of his girls to `co-star' when things got too hot for the real actors.  It co-stars an exhibitionist model Theresa Ann Savoy and the lead is played by the insane and undeniable presence of Malcolm McDowell.  So what the hell happened?  Gore Vidal wrote an awful screenplay and Brass seemed to have problems with the writer wanting all of the credit for the film. This conflict itself along with all the other ego issues probably contributed to its failure.  I also think it is entirely possible that all of the focus, costs and discipline were replaced with piles and piles of uncut cocaine.  Seriously though, the set must've been one enormous party and as we see it was at times a real-life orgy and acting became secondary.  The flaws are almost wholly directorial in nature.  I feel for the cast because the guys behind the scenes had no idea what to do so why bother delivering a decent performance?<br /><br />Anyway, the rumors of Caligula's insanity and the stories that exhibit this were tossed into the picture in spurts and the film follows, and perhaps even sets the standard for, many of the varied cliches applied in shocking the hell out of its audience.  The film stands as a landmark for this alone.  You will not forget Caligula but you may want to forget just how exploitative and stupid it really is.  It's not a movie as much as it is an attempt to hold the title as most disturbing footage ever filmed.  To draw a parallel, I think of the scene were O'Toole's Tiberius is showing Caligula his circus of sex and freaks.  It is almost as if this idea of showing just how indecent and indulgent he has become to Caligula mirrors the intentions of the film itself to it's audience.  I don't believe this is intentional as that would give too many morons too much credit.  I will credit Bob Guccione of Penthouse for adding the hardcore scenes after the film, because let's face it the R-rated version is completely disposable.  You got that?  Don't waste any of your time on that version because everything that the film Caligula sets out to accomplish is on display exclusively on the unrated version.  Guccione probably imagined that his director and writer could inject some artistic merit while he brought his merry band of naked women.  As egotistical as he is, I'm not sure he can be blamed...he kind of did his job.<br /><br />Allow me to point out a few key scenes and why they are monumentally shameless and disqualify Caligula from being a real movie. At the beginning of the movie we see Caligula dancing around, chasing and flirting with his sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy).  The scene's only purpose is to tease the audience with Savoy's body.  She is hardly dressed and by the end of the scene we get a look between her bum cheeks, and then the title of the film appears and the dramatic score is cued.  Why now?  What about the exit of Savoy's lower gastro-intestinal system represents Caligula as a horrible individual or makes any kind of social commentary at all?  It seemed like kind of a strange place to emphasize the direction of the film, although it sure is consistent with what follows.  Moments later (after naked men break rocks or something) we get even closer and more lingering shots at Savoy's intimate areas as she begins rolling around in bed with her brother.  The film goes on and on likethis focusing on different sexual acts and parts of the body, which I guess is all Tinto Brass really does anyway.<br /><br />Judging from behind the scenes extras with Guccione's ranting about some kind of vision, this film is even more unforgivable and ostentatious.  We see blatant fellatio up close and graphic about four or five times, actual brief penetration twice, a long and completely random girl-on-girl scene, a girl peeing on a dead castrated man, people being impaled, a guy being forced to drink whine and then stabbed in the stomach and several other odd things I probably shouldn't get into (I think I've said quite enough).  All of this in the name of what?  It's a mixture of mindless motives because this film is lost.  It says nothing.<br /><br />Notice I refused to make comments on historical accuracy.  Firstly, it is hard to accurately portray something two thousand years old.  Secondly, the film is not convincing.  I don't believe for one nanosecond that any of these characters remotely represent the real people from that real era.  Historical commentary can only be made within a compelling context to begin with.  Theoretically, there could've been something to say here and the film is a complete failure in doing so.  I would love to see someone try to take this story on again, if only to create a film that is this controversial in addition to a film that is actually smart.  This notorious movie fails on so many levels.n different sexual acts and parts of the body, which I guess is all Tinto Brass really does anyway.

Historical commentary can only be made within a compelling context to begin with.   Theoretically, there could've been something to say here and the film is a complete failure in doing so.  I would love to see someone try to take this story on again, if only to create a film that is this controversial in addition to a film that is actually smart.  This notorious movie fails on so many levels.
B000NA2776|4.0|The first thing that has to be said about Mika is that he has an excellent voice, as he should since he studied opera in college. Second is that the comparisons to Freddie Mercury aren't 100% valid. It's definitely true that he sounds like that rock god on opening track and first single \\"Grace Kelly\\" but i don't hear any other spot reminiscent of Queen on this album. This is a good sign, as he shows his versatility throughout this album. \\"Grace Kelly\\" is one of the catchiest songs I've heard in a long time with absolutely brilliant vocals. It will take me awhile to get tired of this one. However, the problem with this album is its usually either hit or miss. The second track \\"Lollipop\\" is absolutely heinous in every way possible, and surprisingly there isnt even a sign of the vocal talent showcased on the opener. By the time a tonedeaf little girl starts yelling the verse of this song, you know its time to skip to the next track (even on first listen) and delete it from your playlist. Things get infinitely better on \\"My Interpretation\\" where Mika turns in a nice piano based midtempo ballad with good vocals and a more normal atmosphere than that of \\"Grace Kelly\\". <br />I'm a little bit undecided about the second single \\"Love Today\\". There are certainly moments of vocal brilliance, but there are also moments where Mika just speaks the words in a very flamboyant manner that merely comes across as irritating. Not terrible, but not great either. Mika showcases yet another side of himself on \\"Relax(Take It Easy)\\" which sounds so much like the old 70's discos jams its funny to realize that it came out in 2007. \\"Ring Ring\\" is another piano based tune, but this one is more upbeat, kind of a mix between the styles of relax and my interpretation. The album highlight for me is \\"Any Other World\\", which is packed with lush string arrangements and excellent vocals (once again). When i first heard this song, I had to stop everything else i was doing and just let the music wash overme, something that happens with only the very best songs. <br />\\"Billy Brown\\" is a funny lighthearted song that tells the story of well...a man named billy brown. \\"Big Girl\\" has been hyped as a modern day \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", but the song just isnt very good musically, and ive come to skip it almost every time, and i'm not a big fan of \\"stuck in the middle\\" either, because its probably the least memorable thing on the album. <br />The end of the album is a real tour de force though. Starting off the conclusion is yet another piano ballad, \\"Erase\\", another one of my favorites on the album, and the pomp and circumstance crescendo of \\"Happy Ending\\" could be the next great graduation song, filled with more pianos, strings, and gospel choirs than any southern church. It might seem a little bit cheesy at times, but the song works well as an almost closer. The hidden track, \\"Over My Shoulder\\", is completely different than anything else on this album. Just piano and voice and very slow, it closes out the album in a luminescent and quite haunting manner. <br />So basically, Mika's debut album is about half hit and half miss. Luckily, the good moments outweigh the bad, and who knows, you might like the overwhelming weirdness of \\"Lollipop\\" and \\"Love Today\\". Overall, its a nice breath of fresh air, and a good album in a year that hasnt seen many yet. 3.5 stars.
B000MV9026|5.0|I had been seeing the trailers for awhile in the theaters and I went to see it when it was released to see if it was as good as the previews.  I thought it was so cute that I bought a copy for my mom when it came out on DVD.
1582701709|1.0|I won't go into great detail, the other 1 star reviews are very well written. I am a Christian and this book is offensive. The only \\"magical checks in the mail\\" are for the author of this TRASH. Awful, I couldn't even get through all of it.
0330485385|4.0|To start off, I recommend this book to anyone who can stand stories that are highly emotional for the reader.  I personally, enjoy those kinds of stories.  The only reason why I gave this book 4 stars (really I would have given it 4 and a half if that was an option), is because there is one scene in the book (which is a major scene in a way, but I feel it could have been left out) that is HIGHLY unrealistic.  In reality, I know that the entire book is probably not realistic, but this particular part of the book would have made me stop reading if I was not towards the end.  The section was a little too sappy for me, and was not what I (nor many of my book club members) would have written if they were the author.  It kind of throws the reader off a little.  That is just a tiny detail, however.  The book covers the emotions and hardships that come with the death of such a young family member.  Just the idea that it was a murder makes the book twice as intense.  It really does leave the reader wondering what it would be like if dead loved ones could see what we were doing here on earth.  I have never read anything like it before!  I can see why it got so much attention when it first came out.
B000G73UEU|3.0|I am a long time fan of Leonard Cohen and thoroughly enjoyed the \\"I'm Your Man\\" DVD, so happily bought the soundtrack...... BUT where are my favorites on this cd?  The Traitor version is different from the amazing dvd rendition, and my all time favorite tune from the movie, Hallelujah, is missing!!!   <br /> <br />Most people are probably familiar with, and prefer, the Buckley rendition of this wonderful Cohen song.  I, too, loved it until I was blessed to hear the Rufus Wainwright version -- now nothing else compares, especially with the harmonies and additional performers on the dvd.  Yes, you can find the song by Rufus on one of his albums, but it's not the one from the dvd -- even the director expressed disappointment at its ommission from what should be a compillation of the best and most important songs.   <br /> <br />Still worth a listen, especially for Antony's chilling version of \\"If it be your will\\" and a couple others, but I need to learn to read the song list & also how to get an audio dub from the film!!!  <br /> <br />Get the DVD instead!
B00005JO9J|4.0|I sat and watched this straight through.  I barely even got up to go to the bathroom.  It was so good.  Dramatic, funny and just great.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|Wonderful, Marvelous. This is just great!!
B00005M989|5.0|This CD was great one of the best that I have purchased in a long time.
B00005KARK|3.0|One of the interesting things about having children (among the many wonderful and interesting things) is getting the chance to re-experience childhood and to see movies I enjoyed as a child. I was somewhat disappointed with \\"Dumbo,\\" though, because of the scene in which the baby elephant Dumbo (who is ostracized by other elephants for having oversized ears) gets drunk, making it seem as if underage drinking is a harmless, playful activity that produces fun and funky hallucinations of dancing pink elephants. Other than that scene, the movie had a good message about overcoming adversity and turning personal weaknesses into triumphant strengths.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. A must - everyone should see this. Al Gore is an excellent speaker who conveys his message very clearly.
0792839749|4.0|I want to start by saying THIS IS NOT A DISNEY MOVIE. SOme of the reviews pan the film because of a connection with Disney. But the film wasn't and isn't a disney release. If you want to hate the movie, you should hate it on its own merits (or lack there of). Personally, as an adult, I find the movie overly long and cloying. BUT, my kids love this movie. Given all the choices they have (and they have a bunch) they often choose this film over many others. They have no problem with the length, and they find the film funny and entertaining. For me, I am pleased that the film has little violence, no bad language, and no nasty double entendres. No \\"winks\\" to an adult audience such as those that peppered all three Shrek movies for example. I, personally, find this refershing. The movie treats children like children, and this is almost reason enough to have a copy around.
B000002BBY|4.0|Flicking through some of the reviews on here, I understand why some people don't like this. Oasis really typified the 90's Indie Rock scene in the UK, they stood for everything that was British culture at the time, they're lyrics and attitude was perfect. So for many americans, i can understand how this culture would pass you by, and in turn this album. Many people really had to be living in Britain at the time to fully get why Oasis and Blur etc were so big. It's much the same for a lot of American artists that we don't get over in the UK.<br /><br />...Either way, a fantastic album full of meaning and great songs.
B00005JPD0|3.0|Ever get tongue-tied after watching a movie? People ask how it was and rather than just say it was \\"okay\\" or \\"sucks\\", you go \\"well...it, hm, it was kinda...yeah.\\" That was basically my reaction after watching Deja Vu. Unlike similar action director Michael Bay, Tony Scott makes weirdly interesting movies as if you know it's not brain food yet you just go along with it (whereas in the case of Bay you can't get it out of your mind how much awfulness there is). It's got time aspects, it's got action, attempts at drama and at times it was even a smart script and that's quite surprising, really. <br /> <br />Doug Carlin is an ATF agent brought on to investigate the explosion onboard a ship celebrating Mardi Gras, killing over 500 passengers. In his investigation he notices a woman, Claire Kuchever, who is revealed was killed before the explosion. The one odd evidence, Carlin finds a group of people who specialize in a quite advanced technology: the ability to see 4 days into the past (they can't rewind or fast-forward, they can only just watch and manipulate from what angle to see from). Carlin uses this technology to try to prevent the murder of Claire, the explosion on the ship and the bomber responsible. <br /> <br />I gotta say that this feels like one disjointed film. First it's a forensic investigation a la CSI, then it's some kind of sci-fi thing, then just a straight action thriller. Now, it does each thing right but it does feel kind of all over the place. For a long while, there's a scene of characters basically watching Claire's life before she dies and you feel like \\"wow, exciting...we're watching characters watching another character who's maybe a little aware she's being watched\\".  Not to mention the science is quite out there. You can tell this was written by a guy who probably studied a physics textbook and said \\"I know how we're going to write it now\\". It's a neat idea but it's used a bit too sparingly although it does have one cool scene involving Carlin watching a mark on the ground while the technicians and the goggles Carlin's holding (which acts as a \\"past viewfinder\\" for lack of a better term) sees the grisly act that makes the mark. <br /> <br />Acting though is pretty solid although characters aren't necessarily one-note, just slightly uninteresting. Val Kilmer plays one of the members on the tech crew yet we barely know anything about who he is, ditto for the other 2 crew members. The only ones that get development are Doug, Claire and a bit about the bomber. It's hard to tell if this is a serious action thriller, a simple thrill-ride or a serious actioner that didn't handle the serious properly. Who knows. It's a Tony Scott movie (you know, Top Gun and Donimo?) so this is basically nothing new; good, but not new. <br /> <br />It's not really a waste of time but it wouldn't make your day better if you saw it.
1582701709|3.0|I saw the movie and have read the book.  The movie was great, but I felt the book was only so-so.  The book is basically a transcript of the movie, but with a few extra things here and there.  It discusses some of the concepts in a bit more detail, but as a result, Byrne often finds herself falling into the trap of contradicting some ideas and statements she makes in other parts of the book (like she didn't remember when writing chapter 8 what she had already stated in chapter 2).  I feel like the best parts of the book come from those she quotes and not Byrne herself.  Her comments and anecdotes, while reaffirming the concepts she introduces through those other sources, often seem to me a little lofty and, I'm sorry to say, a little delusional.  Basically, if you buy this book, it's going to have to be for the general concepts and life affirming advice - you may find yourself having to take the personal anecdotes with a grain of salt.<br /><br />A lot of my friends jumped onto \\"The Secret\\" bandwagon, and, unfortunately, many of them treat the whole \\"law of attraction\\" concept as some sort of magic or voodoo (one wrong step, and you'll have a lifetime of bad luck).  For prospective buyers of this book or movie, please understand that this book is supposed to be *inspirational*.  The law of attraction is not magic, it's about thinking positively, having faith in yourself, being responsible, and being optimistic with the decisions and actions you make in your life.  Also, for those of you who are religious and are hesitant about getting this book, the concepts in this book do not encroach upon or attack any religious beliefs.  In fact, it incorporates concepts from many religions (Christianity, Buddhism, etc.), all of which are actually in tune with each other.<br /><br />Long story short - If you need to find something to inspire you or motivate you, then this book is for you.  If you're trying to find something that is pragmatic and will teach you how to achieve whatever you're trying to achieve, then you might want to look elsewhere.ve whatever you're trying to achieve, then you might want to look elsewhere.

B000PSJDSC|5.0|WOW!  This CD is a winner!  I've got ALL of Michael's CDs; but this one has a different feel.  Each song is it's own story and separate entity.  The flow of this CD is a bit different. Come Fly with Me & It's Time could all be a part of the same CD.  They both had the same feeling to them, but Call Me Irresponsible can't be lumped with those CDs.  I think Michael knocked this one out of the park!  His modern musical interpretation and arrangements of all this classic songs has really struck a cord with me!  There are 2 original tracks (co-written by Michael); \\"Everything\\" and \\"Lost\\" both top notch and probably 2 of my favs.  You can feel a very deep emotional connection with Michael and the songs, whether it be happy or sad.  I really think he has outdone himself once again!  There are 2 duets; Boyz II Men on \\"Coming Home Baby\\" and Ivan Lins on \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" - both very great choices.  It wouldn't be a Michael Buble CD if there were no sexy tunes as well; \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\", \\"Me and Mrs Jones\\"& \\"I'm Your Man\\" very HOT songs, not only Michael vocally are these songs HOT, but the instrumental blew me away!  The light heartedness of \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" and \\"I've Got the World On a String\\", just perfection.  The uplifting and love tunes of \\"Always On My Mind\\" and \\"That's Life\\".  \\"Dream\\" takes me back to old Hollywood.  I can't say enough how wonderfully talented Michael is!  I spread the word - Michael Buble is number 1!! Roll down your windows, crank up your CD player and enjoy the ride!  Now I can't wait for his Tour in the US!  Well done Michael see ya in Maryland!

B0007NMKB2|5.0|Where has this band been all my life?  You know that feeling right?  You've been ignoring a band for such a long time.  You keep hearing things about them, but for whatever reason just don't get around to listening to them.  Then when you do, it's so mind-blowingly amazing and exactly everything that you like about music that you wish you had gotten in on the ground floor.  That's how I felt about Dinosaur Jr the first time I heard this album.  Regrettably, that was only about 4 months ago.    <br /> <br />I came across Dinosaur Jr in my journey to fill the holes of my musical knowledge (I am one of those obsessive music people, with a bias towards underground and indie).  I never liked the eighties at all, so I was in the course of listening to all the underground acts that I had missed by dismissing the whole decade for so long.  Along the way I discovered the Minutemen, Husker Du, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Echo & the Bunnymen and many more that I had heard mentioned a lot but had basically ignored (more because of the fact that I always have such a long list of bands to listen to that I never got to it).  I kept seeing Dinosaur Jr's name pop up, but it was still last on the list.  What a shock when I finally heard \\"Freak Scene\\" by them!  It was one of those moments where, before you even are done listening to the song the first time, you know it has entered into your personal pantheon of all-time great songs.  Naturally, I went out and bought `Bug' which only cemented my love of Dino Jr and I have since become very familiar with their whole catalogue.  <br /> <br />`Bug', currently the last album by the original trio, opens with a one-two sucker punch of \\"Freak Scene\\" and \\"No Bones\\".   \\"Freak Scene\\" opens as lazy garage rock at it's finest, with J delivering the first verse in typical laid back fashion: <br />\\"Seen enough to eye you, <br />But I seen too much to try you. <br />It's always weirdness while you <br />Dig it much too much to fry you. <br />The weirdness flows between us, <br />Anyone could tell to see us. <br />Freak scene just can't believe us, <br />Can't it just be cool and free us.\\" <br />The last line is delivered and almost drowned out by the immediate thrashing on low E.  The bashing seems to be the musical representation of breaking free, although it doesn't seem to work because the first verse is repeated as some acoustic strumming manages to peak it's head forward.  Maybe J decided to stop trying to break free and accept his place?  No, as he says it's \\"so f**ked I can't believe it...what a mess it's best to leave it.\\"  The following guitar solo is perfect, but it's when everything suddenly drops out and J delivers the classic last lines that \\"Freak Scene\\" crosses the threshold of greatness: <br />\\"Sometimes I don't thrill you, <br />Sometimes I think I'll kill you. <br />Just don't let me f**k up will you, <br />Cause when I need a friend it's still you.\\" <br />Clearly this is a song about a particularly stormy relationship, but there's just something in the details of it that make it more.  Maybe it's just the fact that this is the first song I ever heard by them, the one that started it all for me.  Maybe the way that even after that last verse you still can just barely make out Mascis sigh \\"what a mess\\" as he fires his way through the final solo.   <br /> <br />\\"No Bones\\" pretty much continues in this same fashion.  The little descending guitar riff/fill that permeates throughout the song gives it a unique identity on the album as it slowly winds its way to the climactic end.  The solo at the end gives out to what sounds like layers of feedback that can best be described as sounding how lightning actually looks.  Keep listening for the acoustic guitar strumming that doesn't quite break through the noise completely, but the feedback somehow compliments it while J slowly sings the last verse.   <br /> <br />\\"Yeah We Know\\" is set apart by the bludgeoning wah-wah riff that refuses to let up at any point, as well as yet another great solo.  \\"Let It Ride\\" is, musically, a bit of a lighthearted point of the album and on this album that's quite welcome.  \\"Pond Song\\"  continues this kind of faux-happy sound.  The guitar is somewhat restrained, with a great riff and quiet, high pitched feedback that beautifully harmonizes with J. throughout the song, which is one of the album highlights.  \\"Budge\\" follows with some straight ahead grunge rock comparable to Pearl Jam with a touch of Pavement (and it's worth noting that Pavement weren't formed until a year later).   <br /> <br />As a rabid Neil Young fan, it's really no surprise that Dinosaur Jr has quickly become such a favorite.  J Mascis somehow manages to channel not only Neil's voice, but his lead guitar and songwriting style as well.  The big, dumb riffs of \\"Yeah We Know\\" are pure `Rust Never Sleeps', while things like \\"Pond Song\\" and \\"Keep the Glove\\" have melodies that recall the poppier songs from `Zuma' or `Everybody Knows'.  Of course, all this is not to say that Dino Jr sounds anything like a Crazy Horse cover band.  Certainly they are informed by the hardcore scene they came out of, as witnessed in the thrashy parts of \\"Freak Scene\\" and obviously in \\"Don't\\".  The rhythm section of Murph and Barlow are also clearly more musical than Crazy Horse at their best.  <br /> <br />After `Bug', bassist Lou Barlow left, feeling smothered by Mascis, to form his own band, Sebadoh, which would become a great indie band in it's own right.  Dinosaur Jr's first three albums would become huge influences on Pavement, Pearl Jam, Weezer, and of course Nirvana which, looking back, ironically would become a dinosaur of a different sort.  J. continued making albums under the bands name until 1997, never quite reaching the same heights but coming awfully close on `Where You Been?' and `Green Mind'.  The new album, `Beyond', proves that they are as great as ever, if not better.  Long live Dinosaur Jr.

1582701709|4.0|For the past 20 years or so, I have been aware of the timeless concepts presented in this book.  These universal spiritual principles probably date back thousands of years; they are valid for all people at any time or place.  I congratulate Rhonda Byrne for enlisting a number of practitioners to bring these concepts--once more--to the attention of today's generation. It is NOT easy to put these principles into practice, however, since it is NOT easy to eliminate fear and/or doubt from one's mind! Nevertheless it is worthwhile for today's generation to understand that many aspects of their lives could be vastly improved if they could change the way they think.  I am totally persuaded that an individual's health, interpersonal relations, financial circumstances, etc., depend significantly upon that person's frame of mind.

An exciting bonus is the DVD offering rare never-before-seen footage of landmark recording sessions, live performances, and music videos.  Stevie Nicks is a timeless artist and this album/DVD release is a timeless product.  It gives creedence to her staying power and the deserving title of the \\"Queen of Rock.\\"

B000JBWWRY|3.0|I'd forgotten that major plot points in Peter Pan revolve around mysoginistic pre-adolecent female attacks on each other and racist stereotypes of Aboriginal people, so when my three year old pointed to the 'cheifum' and asked what he was, I was at a loss. If I'd said, 'oh, that's a Native American,' she would've thought to associate that image with Native folks forever, which is a bad thing. I ended up telling her he was a 'stereotype', and she asked no more. She now refers to him as 'that big guy'. I can't wait to explain why the mermaids were trying to kill Wendy.  <br /> <br />Still, the movie has its merits and tinkerbell is pretty popular around here. I would choose many other movies over this one, but compared to such abominations as 'Cars' or 'Madagascar', the quality of this production is unmistakeable. Be aware though - if your children begin pushing other girls on the playground while chasing a particular boy or shouting 'how!' and pretending to scalp each other, you'll have this movie to blame for it!!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The movie was great, start to finish.  As always, orders from Amazon <br />arrive promptly and in excellent condition.  Craig is BOND!!!!!

B000O1799U|4.0|Be careful which DVD you order. Amazon seems to merge all the reviews together of the two-disc and single-disc versions. So when I was reading on the product page of the single disc, the reviewer was talking about the two-disc set.<br /><br />Here's the link to the two-disc version: [[ASIN:B000O174CM Dreamgirls (Two-Disc Showstopper Edition)]]<br /><br />What I watched was [[ASIN:B000O1799U Dreamgirls (Widescreen Edition)]], which is a single disc. It contains:<br />1. the widescreen edition of the movie<br />2. extended and alternative scenes<br />3. music video of \\"Listen\\" by Beyonce Knowles<br />4. previews of Norbit and Shrek 3
B0000024JN|5.0|In response to Rickey Wright's editorial review (this guy's an editor and didn't see this?)... <br /> <br />The joke, Mr. Wright, is not them crashing their jet into the side of a mountain and surviving, but rather what the image turns into when you unfold the album cover and hold it length-wise with the tail-end up. It's the image of a 'joint' being mashed out (like a cigarette in an ashtray). So I think the genius behind it works, making the obvious - unobvious. <br /> <br />Also, the call letters on the rear of the plane (3MTA3) actually spell 'EAT ME' when viewed in reverse - which is what is usually done when you're smokin' a fatty and 'Jake' is on ya.  <br /> <br />As for the album itself - CLASSIC! True Beastie Boy gold!
0743289412|5.0|On par with the Talisman, very very good. I am actually puzzled by the negative reviews. Read and see.
B0007M22TI|5.0|As seen on PBS with a few additional songs and interviews with each of the girls and David Downes, their talented musical director.  I ordered this DVD after I'd seen the group's second PBS special and I have to say, this one is actually better.  Pop it in the DVD player as background entertainment while you're having a get-together and you will get plenty of compliments!
B00005JPAO|4.0|I have to confess, I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is nothing short of stunning, and is much deserving of the Oscar and all other awards bestowed upon her... The script, however, left me a bit flat. It seemed rather conventional and TV-movie-of-the-weekish, and rather insular as well. Screenwriter Peter Morgan assumes a great deal from his audience, most of all that we have already shared in the media mania that surrounded Princess Diana, and are all well steeped in the twists and turns of her life story, and in her relationship to the royal family. Of course, millions and millions of people are well-versed in the minutae of that story, but for those of us who were casual and neutral observers, this movie does a poor job explaining what transpired, and the significance of various events and personal histories. A great deal of familiarity with the royal family is taken for granted, and we are expected to know their personalities -- the steadfast Elizabeth, the dithering Prince Charles, the bigoted Prince Philip. We're also expected to know their place in the national psyche of Great Britain, and to really feel the dramatic heft and social significance of the commoners rebelling against the old-world propriety of the nobles. In many regards, it's amazing that this film played as well as it did to the American audience... I suppose it's due to two factors, the enduring tabloid appeal of the late Diana, and to Helen Mirren's masterful performance. It's an impressive bit of acting, buoyed by other first-class actors... Bravo, Ms. Mirren... On to bigger and greater triumphs!

B000066JCT|5.0|\\"Twin Peaks\\" was the ultimate cult TV show -- suspenseful, complex, hilariously written and with hidden layers that casual channel-flippers might not catch.<br /><br />And though it's only eight episodes, the first season of David Lynch and Mark Frost's \\"Twin Peaks\\" is a brilliant piece of television, with a dozen subplots all somehow linked to the mysterious death of the beautiful, troubled Laura Palmer. Brilliant writing, quirky acting, and great cherry pie are all mixed up in the darkly eerie season.<br /><br />For the record, it doesn't contain the pilot episode, where Laura is found \\"wrapped in plastic,\\" and Special Agent Dale Cooper(Kyle McLachlan) is called in to investigate. Nope, the first season starts with the episode after that: Cooper continues to enjoy the comforts of the hotel, while continuing the investigation -- and getting some surprising results from the autopsy.<br /><br />What's more, the question of who killed Laura is getting more complex, due to a bloody shirt, a drug deal, a secret affair and a heart necklace. People catch glimpses of a one-armed man and a grey-haired killer -- and Cooper has a prophetic dream with both men, as well as a red room, a double of Laura Palmer, and a tiny man who dances to jazz music.<br /><br />While Cooper tries to sort out his evidence and dreams, he finds that Twin Peaks is not the small-town idyll he thought it was, and Laura Cooper was enmeshed in its darkness. There are secret love affairs, town crazies, drug smuggling, corporate devilry about a mill, and an evil presence that lurks in the woods nearby...<br /><br />\\"Twin Peaks\\" is hard to even describe, because the plots were a perfect balance of the surreal and mundane. It starts off as a basic murder mystery that allows us to the see the underbelly of rural America. But starting in the second episode, it becomes something much, much more.<br /><br />Lynch loads the storyline down with eerie symbolism, creepy visions and inscrutable (but important) lines (\\"Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....\\"). But he and Frost also spun up some wonderfully quirky scenarios, such as Cooper throwing stones to determine who killed Laura, or his famous dream of a dancing midget and a strange Laura double, both talking in a weird \\"backwards\\" manner.<br /><br />And the dialogue has that brilliace that most series cannot keep going for long (\\"Fellas, don't drink that coffee! You'd never guess... there was a fish in the percolator\\"). Considering how strange the characters are -- including Cooper -- it's not too surprising that it's crammed with quotables (\\"Black as midnight on a moonless night....\\" \\"Pretty black\\").<br /><br />And the characters are VERY strange. Cooper himself is played with quirky brilliance by McLachlan -- he's a bright, lovable, friendly kind of guy who loves Tibetan mysticism, tape recorders and a \\"damn fine cup of coffee.\\" He's not your average hard-nosed FBI agent.<br /><br />And Cooper flanked by a number of talented actors playing two basic varieties of characters: the relatively normal ones with a slight quirk, such as abusive truckers, the sheriff, teen lovers, obnoxious FBI agents. And the REALLY strange ones, like the weird Log Lady, the one-armed man, the spacey Lolita, and the eerie spirits that haunt Twin Peaks.<br /><br />Quirky and surreal TV is currently in vogue, but they all stem from the little town of \\"Twin Peaks,\\" and the first season is an entrancing experience.ut important) lines (\\"Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....\\").

B000GLKLCK|5.0|The performances on this 12 disc set have been praised since they were orginally issued in the late 1970s and through the 1980s.  I have other complete sets and individual discs of these works, and I find myself returning to Perahia as my favorites.  He has astounding tone and sense of rhythm, and the English Chamber Orchestra is in lock step with him throughout I am sure in part due to the fact that Perahia conducted them from the keyboard. <br /> <br />What makes this 2006 reissue even more special?  First, Sony remastered all of the recordings using their Direct Stream Digital process and SBM direct.  What this means is that the sound sparkles with a realism that was lacking before.  In addition, the set is packaged in sturdy envelopes and a cardboard case that takes a little over an inch of shelf space.  It saves you money, and takes up much less space that traditional jewel case require. <br /> <br />A legendary set, with recent technical improvements, at a great price. <br /> <br />Highest of recommendations!
0553278398|5.0|Classic science fiction by one of the masters.  Fantasy fans might get bogged down, but for sci-fi purists this is the stuff.  The whole Foundation series is excellent and I would highly recommend.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|I love Jude Law! With those sexy baby blues and that raspy accented voice its easy to look past his philandering ways. On top of that he plays a doting single dad to two adorable little girls..definitely a recipe for greatness. I like Jack Black in this too. He had a few goofball moments but for the most part played a romantic kind of dude. It wasn't an Oscar contender for the acting but it was a nice little feel good movie. Even people whose lovelives are downright pitiful can find someone when they least expect it. I for one needed to believe in that.
044651652X|5.0|Usually I have read the book first before seeing the film and the film disappoints. This time I had seen the film with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood in the starring roles. I could only admire the casting when I read the book. Neither disappointed. The book is a delight: beautiful writing and sensitive treatment of the characters.I have subsequently bought the  follow-ups, A Thousand Country Roads and High Plains Tango. Both lived up to expectations. Highly recommended. J A  Were. Christchurch New Zealand
B00005O3VC|5.0|Love Monty Python, love amazon.com - good deal on a classic comedy!
B00005JPFH|5.0|First off I must say the story line in this one is a lot darker then in the first 2 spiderman films. There is also a lot more action in this one. I thought throwing in more villians in this one gave spidey more of a challenge and it did. I think fans of the first 2 films wont be dissapointed just because of the eye candy and the action scences. Last of all the story line is very good and will keep you watching.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have been a fan of the FF series and love the CG anime. This one blows my mind. The graphics were better on \\"The Sprits Within\\", but the story lacked. This one has almost on par with graphics but has a good story with a lot of good action scenes. A thunderball from the start.
B0009IW88A|5.0|One of the best soundtracks that I have heard in a long time.  Enough said.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|It is sort of movie that you watch once and have fun during. Good action scenes, stretched out fantasies.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|I read many really bad reviews about this one, so I was prepared for the worst.  I thought it was pretty darn good though.  Yes, I prefer DC's animation over Marvel's, but this is quality animation.  It is clearly its own style.  I look forward to the next installment.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|The best of the best of Bond. A grownup realistic portrayal. A bit violent for younger viewers but for the rest of us, wow. Tight knit story, great views, great stunts that did not strain the believable factor.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I would kick out the current administration and install the cast and crew of the west wing led by President Sheen. <br />This would have to be the pinnicle of Television production. to borrow a line from \\"Jack\\", this is \\"as good as it gets\\".  <br />The only problem is, be prepared to be berated by your partner for spending all your spare time glued to the box.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I love this film.  In fact, it's so good, you don't remember that you're watching actors.  Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connolly, and Marlon Wayans are just brilliant.  I was so engrossed in the story that I was a bit shocked when it was over.  The film's drug use sequences are genius.  They are fast, shocking, and consistent.  This film had the potential to be a bit confusing but the drug use sequences tied everything together beautifully without becomming too graphic.  Jared Leto's performance was stunning.  He goes all out for this film and it makes every painful moment of Harry's life worth watching.  Ellen Burstyn was completely believable considering what a classy lady she seems to be in real life.  This film does not glamorize drug culture and the addictions of every sort are brought to us in all their gritty truth.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watch the US version, the one with Sigourey Weaver, and while I liked her voice, I am not particularily impressed whit her saying constantly \\"This is the first time ever seen\\", or \\"No ne else have ever filmed this before\\" which in contrast to David Attenborough commentary is not mentioned as often. I thought they had the same script, but despite that the quality is excellent, even better than the HD version on Discovery.  <br /> <br />Not sure why someone would want to purchase the DVD version, might as well record from TV.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|Once again, as on previous CD's, Michael Buble delivers great vocals for some wonderful songs we all know and love.  However, where were the arrangers; were they on vacation or taking a nap during these recording sessions???? <br />  Most of us who love Buble's style love all the \\"kicks\\" in the way he delivers a song. This is due to dynamic arrangements which include plenty of  horns and  strings with a great rhythm section.  Even a ballad can deliver a \\"WOW\\" with the right kind of arrangement. <br />      This CD fell short of the expectation I have of Michael Buble's recordings......Not totally his fault; his vocals are right on the money, but there is nothing exciting or unexpected about the songs. <br />
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I've noticed some of the comments here stating this story is somewhat improbable and (Western) Ukraine isn't all that bad. <br />But as an ex-Ukrainian Jew I can say that it is! Though it's getting better... <br />My grandmother survived the war, passing herself off as a gentile Ukrainian girl, but she watched as thousands were taken out of their homes in Vinnitsa by german soldiers with the ever helpful Ukrainians running around and pointing at Jewish houses. After they were rounded up, a handful were selected for labor (slavery) camps and others were shot in the woods. She later found the spot where her mother was shot in the back while holding her 2 year old cousin. Obviously it is impossible for all Ukrainians to be monsters and as proof of that there is Yad-Vashem that named hundreds of Ukrainians as Righteous Among the Nations. My grandma was saved by a Ukrainian woman who took care of her as only a mother can. Unfortunately for every such happy ending, there are hundreds of unnerving ones, where Ukrainian police participated in the orderly gunning-down and TNT-ing of Jewish children (See Babi Yar, Odessa, Lvov, Vinnitsa...) <br />One day when my then 12-year-old grandma was sent on an errand she was stopped by the police acting on a tip-off. They insisted she was a Jew and wanted to send her to the Germans, but another officer interfered and insisted that a Jew couldn't have such \\"Ukrainian blue\\" eyes and fair hair and that the others should stop putting Ukrainian girls at risk. <br /> <br />I'm very happy to have known this wonderful shtetl of Trochimbrod. <br />The only thing left to do now is live on and honor the dead by remembering them and learning the right lessons.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|For those of you who remember Neil Young in the earlier days this is an excellent album to listen to.  He is playing a lot of those songs we now think of as oldies when they were new.  And, he is playing a lot of it either acoustically or with a minimum of band.  This album features very good instrument work.  Neil has somewhat of a conversation with the audience which interesting.  And, the DVD shows just what shows in those days were like. <br /> <br />As before, this is an excellent album to remember Neil Young in the earlier days.  I highly recommend it
B00005JLF5|5.0|I love Star Trek (in most of it's incarnations) and easily loved Deep Space Nine the best.  This is the start of a wonderful series, with awesome characters and stories.  I think one of the things I like best about this series, is that it takes place in a fixed location.  And in setting the story on a space station, you get to know the place and all its inhabitants better.  There is room for development of not just primary characters, and that I think is what makes this series so good.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I wish that I could have given this movie less than 1 star, but the system wouldn't let me.  This has to be the worst, plotless movie that I have EVER seen.  I kept watching it, because I thought that it had to get better, but it kept getting worse.  Let me repeat, there is NO plot whatsoever.  I can't believe that a mainstream movie company actually greenlighted this script.  Do NOT waste your money!!! <br /> <br />p.s. Like 10 minutes of this mess of a movie would not have been enough, it is WAY too long, and lasts about 2 hours (which feels like 7 hours).
075640407X|5.0|If one book is chosen this year as a must read in fantasy then there would be no discussion. This novel, \\"The Name of the Wind\\", would win hands down, no questions asked. Patrick Rothfuss has mixed together a brilliant storyline, wonderful and believable characters, an engaging world, and magic to create this masterpiece. <br /> <br />The first in a trilogy, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" tells of the early life of Kvothe of the Edema Ruh. Kvothe sees much of the world before he is twelve, but it is in his twelth year that his life dramatically shifts. I would love to say more on how, but I couldn't bare to spoil anything for you. This book tells of Kvothe's trials and tribulations, from learning about symphany (magic) to the University, from his run-ins with another student to his music, from his obsession with the Chandrian to his fight with a draccus. As you read, you will understand everything I have just mentioned. <br /> <br />The words that Rothfuss has so brilliantly displayed jump off the page and dance before your eyes. Rothfuss's eloquent style of relaying the actions, emotions, and happenings of Kvothe will keep you awake at night while you try to absorb every word before your eyes are too laden with sleep. Please, please purchase this book and experience how a book can bring another world to life right before your eyes. This book deserves every bit of praise it receives and then some. Enjoy!
B00004YA66|5.0|This has to be the most underrated movie ever.  It has incredible performances from two incredible actors (Dennis Quaid is awesome and Jim Caviezel is beyond awesome!!!)  It keeps you on the edge of your seat nearly through the entire movie, and it has some awesome plot twists.  I highly recommend this movie!!!  Buy it because you will want to watch it again and again! <br /> <br />p.s.  The music is also great!  If you don't like the song \\"When You Come Back to Me Again\\", there is something wrong with you.
B000M341QE|4.0|The screenwriters did a brilliant job taking the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of murder, intrigue, the underworld, family ties and primal revenge in the Departed. A must see for any young business executive wanting to understand how to really get ahead in business.
0790729350|3.0|My kids gave me this, probably to stop me binding on about the old days, and it is intresting to see some of this about 37 years after I first saw it on the big screen in Edinburgh. <br /> <br />Something that you don't realise from early cuts is just how lamentable some the the bands were - no wonder it was so swingingly edited. Jefferson Airplane are beyond awful, and Canned Heat are quite dire - I don't know what Henry Vestine was on but his guitar is out of time, out of tune and out of it completely. Some acts managed to get it together, such as the Who, Santana, and even Country Joe and the Fish (nice, if out of tune, guitar from Barry Melton) and it is easy to see why dear old Alvin Lee in 10 Years After was such a hit - coming from a country that boasted Peter Green, Jeff Beck, Clapton, Rory Gallagher, Jimmy Page, Kim Simmons, Mick Green and many others, it was the norm to be very good and to play very well. Excellence was expected and the British Blues Scene led the world. Muddy, BB King and many others have paid tribute to the Stones, the Beatles, Clapton, Green and all the others for making sure that anybody who isn't from the planet Zark knows who Robert Johnson is. <br /> <br />If you had to sum the whole thing up, I suppose that the performances by CSN and Ritchie Havens sum it up pretty well musically - lots of flailing at acoustic guitars and sweet vocals. And Hendrix ... well, Hendrix. I blow very hot and cold about Sir Jimi, and I am cold about this performance too. Thank goodness somebody else has had the courage to say that he was not actually that good. In 1968, at the Woburn Abbey Festival, I saw a dreadful performance from Hendrix, and I mean dreadful, when he was completely upstaged by a 20-year-old Rory Gallagher with a primitive version of Taste. And here they are again, a year after Woodstock, at the Isle of Wight Festival, and those who were there told me at the time that the absolute show-stoppers were Procol Harum (don't laugh - they hadRobin Trower, BJ Wilson and Gary Brooker)and ... Rory Gallagher with Taste. Luckily we have \\"Taste At The Isle Of Wight\\" available so you can judge for yourselves..... but that great Deceiver, Memory, has put Saint Jimi forward as the star of the IOW show.  <br /> <br />Anyway, as a social document it is fascinating, lots of Peace and Love and rolling in the mud. But like all dreams it had to stop, and what this self-contained village (supported by food drops and an army of social and medical volunteers) left behind was a bloody awful mess, an emerging account of some very threatening back-stage scenes and an acreage \\"ankle deep in human s***\\", as one American (called Berry - where else?) who was there told me. It reminds me of the Travellers, who want to be \\"left alone\\" and not \\"victimised\\" - as long as some silly bu**er in full-time work is prepared to pick up the tab, hand over the dole, pay for the schooling, pay for the medical needs, pay for everything in fact. I know that's a bit cynical, because there really was a soft feeling to the 60s and early 70s, but there was also a buzz of anger and violence. Perhaps you had to live through Nixon, Vietnam and the Hell's Angels to really get the point of Woodstock. Perhaps not.  <br /> <br />Buy? Yes, I guess so, because there are good parts musically and socially, and it surely won't happen again. But FF the dreadful bands - there's a lot of them, too - almost all from the U S of A. <br />
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is one of the funniest shows of all time.  It's a little expensive for twelve episiodes but I bought it new when it was on sale.  Plus, you can watch these episodes again and again and because of the quick humor you'll laugh every time.  Definitely add Fawlty Towers to your collection!
0765340798|3.0|The Battle of Corrin is well written and entertaining.  It also contains the birth, if you will, of the world order found in the original Dune series.  It leaves a few large-ish questions unanswered, presumably to leave the door open to more prequels.  The biggest questions posed in the first installment of Legends of Dune are answered but some of those answers feel anticlimactic and clumsy in their execution.  The resolution of the Harkonnen/Atreides question felt especially unconvincing. <br />The one thing I found interesting in the book is its criticism of democracy, i.e. its inherent lack of long term determination and unwillingness to face critical problems if they have high-cost solutions.  This idea is not new, though, and proof of the problem can be found in today's Afghanistan, among other places.
0671027344|5.0|I chose this story to read for my english project not knowing how much i'd love it. I have since read it 5 times and decided to buy it myself. Right now my friend has it because i know he can relate to it. I'd suggest this book to anyone who feels even slightly outcasted and needs something to relate to. It really opened my eyes. Thank you, Cbosky.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|As a life-long Rush-er, I will start by saying that I am happy to have a chance to review another RUSH album this late in their game.  Having said that, I will not give even my favorite bands a free pass.  The mix is the best since Counter Parts, no doubt about that.  Apart from the single, there is no one killer song that I gravitate back to time after time.  I gave this CD about 20 solid listens before I formed an opinion.  There are indeed a few throw away tracks.  There are songs that have some great elements but I find myself wanting a bit more vocal melody on a few songs.  I love the instrumentals and started thinking maybe they should approach an album with an instrumental mentality and then throw on the vocal melodies.  No track-by-track breakdown here, I find that annoying.  I'm sure I will grow to love this in a way I think back fondly on a hot piece of tail I had years back and wonder what became of her. <br /> <br />I give this band all the credit in the world but there is at times something, some cohesiveness missing that I can't quite put my finger on.   4 stars for an incredible body of work and 3 1/2 for the CD.  <br />

B000090278|5.0|MY DYING BRIDE, PARADISE LOST, CATHEDRAL, WINTER, disEMBOWELMENT, and lastly ANATHEMA are the god-fathers of the \\"Doom/Death\\" movement... Silent Enigma is what I like to consider the last truely original \\"Doom/Death\\" record... scores of bands count them as influence...<br /><br />I have always nicknamed this release as the \\"Into the Pandemonium\\" of this era of \\"Doom/Death\\" metal... Vincent's \\"clean\\" vocals are very similiar to what Tom G. Warrior refered to as his \\"mournful vocal\\"... and the guitar work is simply brilliant, and crushingly heavy. This album is a very important release of this era and for those who dont own it, that's unfortunate.
0205313426|3.0|If you are an English major or playwrite, maybe this book is for you, but if you just need a book to suggest ways to draft letters to corporate america, I think you can find smaller and better directed information.
B000O178BY|1.0|There are no melodies or solid guitar riffs in any of the songs on this album.  Heaviness is not to be found either - everything is a soft drone of mostly random noise.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I first saw this movie as a netflix rental, and loved it so much I bought a copy from Amazon. I won't say exactly what part of the movie I related to (it would spoil it if you haven't seen it) but part of it really touched me. Of course, the characters are all charming and attractive (especially Jude Law!) but also easy to relate to.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is a nice, romantic story about being different, living well, and accepting the differences in others.  Johnny Depp plays a fairly minor role, the real stars are Juliette Binoche Alfred Molina and Judi Dench.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Yes, you can watch this film and pick out problems with the logic of time travel and the consequences of changing the past, but then what are you thinking?  Time travel movies are notorious for not being logical.  Watch this movie as an action adventure and just enjoy it.  Denzel Washington is terrific.  The rest of the cast is very good.   This is just a good movie to pass some time and enjoy yourself.  Also, you don't have to worry about your kids.  There is no foul language to ruin family fun.
B0006B2A42|4.0|Just a good solid sci-fi/adveture picture. This is what the studio put up against 2001 a space odessey. Good actors, good special effects for the day. Great story from the cold war, you'll like it.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is ending this year.  Season 7 shall be the end of one of the most creative, witty, intelligent and well acted series on television.<br /><br />Season 1 begins it all and this show is very rare for most shows are a little rusty during their first season.  Not Gilmore Girls.  You watch the pilot and it's as if these people have always been around.  And by mid season its as if the show has been around for years.<br /><br />The acting from the entire stellar cast is exemplary but none of it could exist without Lorelai - the truly believable characterization brought to life by the gifted Lauren Graham.  She carries this show on her shoulders entirely.  Yes, she and Alexis Blesdel as the amazing Rory have unique and true chemistry.<br /><br />But it is Lauren's acting chops that everyone els must match.  Her scenes with her mother - Kelly Bishop and Luke - Scott Patterson are all Emmy worthy.  And who can't love the sweet and wacky Sookie.<br /><br />I have always found it sad that this show was on the WB (now the CW) for shows on this network never got their due.  Had this show been on a major network it would have garnered Emmy nods and wins every year - especially Lauren Graham.<br /><br />But get season 1 and all the rest.  Gilmore Girls may be leaving prime time but it will never leave my life.  I have just started watching the dvd's from season 1 for the third time.  It always sparkles and never looses its glow.
B0006Z2LP6|4.0|I had to replace my original Apollo 13 DVD which, after several successful playings, started to fail to \\"play back.\\"  Possibly, this failure was exacerbated by my attempted \\"fix\\" which was to clean the business side of the DVD with an (electronic grade) 99% alcohol cleaning solution. <br /> <br />At any rate, I am happy to have the new disk. <br /> <br />(Of the many [more than 100] DVDs I have, this is the only instance of media failure I have experienced.) <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
0780628551|2.0|This was a pretty disappointing movie.  When I first read the description and found out Johnny Depp was going to be one of the main characters, I got excited.  Unfortunately, his performance couldn't save a rather boring and slow-moving storyline.  However, this was one of his older films, and was made before he turned into an extremely popular movie star.  If only the plot was actually more interesting, I might have given the Astronaut's Wife a higher score.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|After viewing Kerry Conran's \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\\" I was definitely looking forward to tomorrow. Here's a film that looks and feels so different from anything modern movie audiences are used to that it's sort of difficult to get your head around the whole thing. Maybe it had something to do with the techniques Conran used to create the movie. According to the featurettes on the DVD, he created everything we see on his computer. None of the sets existed in reality. Only the actors and actresses are real (although one can certainly make an argument that Gwyneth Paltrow is not real in any way, shape, or form--an argument for another day, alas), and they had to stand in front of blue screens and basically imagine what was going on. Conran filled in all the details later. This process creates an intriguing world--the equivalent of eye candy of a particularly delicious sort I must say--albeit one that doesn't favor a human focus. We're so caught up in the breathtaking visuals that the actors and the story sort of slide into the backseat. Truth be told, there isn't much of a story to tell. What story there is exists to showcase the visuals.<br /><br />The main character in \\"Sky Captain\\" is one Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), a sort of citizen of the world, James Bond type who flits around the globe saving us from evil. He owns a really cool underground base filled with planes and various high tech gadgets. He receives help in his missions from Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi), his head scientist and a crack inventor. Whenever trouble erupts, Sullivan, otherwise known as the Sky Captain, hops in his trusty plane and flies to the scene of the crime. His latest mission promises to be a doozy. Gigantic robots are rampaging through the streets of New York, smashing their way through buildings and sending the civilian population into a frenzy. What sort of madness is this? That's for Sky Captain to find out. Fortunately, his old flame Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is on the case. She's a hard driven reporter who possesses such a cool demeanor that she's calling her story into the paper as the robots rampage. Sullivan and Perkins must team up, amidst much wisecracking, to unlock the mystery of the robots and to stop the heinous evil behind them.<br /><br />Their adventures take them from place to place in a non-stop flurry of activity that leaves the viewer breathless. The two literally fly around the world, and under the ocean, to save the world. They discover that one Dr. Totenkopf, a World War I German scientist and all-around jerk, is the man behind the metal behemoths. He resides in an enormous complex located on a secret island guarded by all sorts of perilous henchmen. Before they can pay a visit to Totenkopf, however, Sullivan and Perkins must protect the contents of a couple of mysterious vials, and they must also rescue Dex Dearborn, who was captured during a raid on the Sky Captain's airfield. It's a tall order, but fortunately our dynamic duo can rely on the gregarious Franky (Angelina Jolie with a really cute hat and an eye patch), the commander of a British air fleet that floats, literally, through the air. Franky and the Sky Captain have a past of their own to work through, much to the consternation of Polly, but the assistance rendered by the Brits helps move the adventure along to its over the top conclusion at Totenkopf's over the top fortress. It makes sense that none other than the late Laurence Olivier plays the evil doctor.<br /><br />I couldn't hate this movie if I tried. \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" bombed big time at the box office, but a lot of critics loved it. I can see why reviewers went gaga over this flick. I think several elements factor into the critical praise. One, it's the plot and style of the film, the way Conran took the 1930s serial actioner and brought it into the modern day, that wins plaudits. The color scheme alone, a mix of blurry browns and blues that makes the movie looklike a photograph taken in 1935, shows a love for old movies that literally leaps off the screen. Two, the fantastical elements, the sheer over the top effects seen in every frame of the film, take the viewer back to the heady days of childhood when going to the movies meant stepping into a magical world far different from reality. Three, and finally, the banter between the characters mirrors in no small part the sort of wordplay one would see in an old black and white movie. Movie reviewers think of films in a different way than most people. They really believe that a film should transport the viewer to a different time and place, and they're willing to applaud a movie that does just that. This is why they liked \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\".<br /><br />Despite the poor box office, I think \\"Sky Captain\\" has already proved its influence on the future of film. Just watch \\"300\\". A lot of what we see there, in a technical sense, originated with Kerry Conran's picture. Needless to say, the DVD presentation is nearly flawless. The picture and audio quality will make your jaw drop, especially if you watch this on one of those big, fancy television screens. Extras include a couple of commentary tracks featuring Conran, producer Jon Avnet, and selected members of the visual effects crew. We also get a few featurettes giving us a behind the scenes look at the film's production as well as interviews with members of the cast. A gag reel, some trailers, deleted scenes, and the original six-minute film Conran made to sell the idea to a studio round out the disc. Whew! So there you go. Check this one out posthaste.

B000000W5H|4.0|Even though I'm giving this album a 4 rating, it's more like 3.5.  I'm totally serious when I say my least two favorite tracks on this album are the title song (which was never interesting to me) and their version of \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\".  The rest of the album rules, though. <br /> <br />My favorites would be \\"Luxury\\" with its beautiful vocal melody, and the more emotional tunes such as \\"Time Waits for No One\\" and \\"If You Really Want to Be My Friend\\".  Also on the album are short catchy little rockers (\\"Dance Little Sister\\" and \\"Short and Curlies\\").  The album closes with a really good groove rocker called \\"Fingerprint Files\\" and I mine as well mention that the album opens with the perfect hard rockin' \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\".   <br /> <br />Also worth mentioning is that the piano playing throughout the whole album is the main highlight.  I love it.  It's the best thing about it, in my opinion.  This album catches the Stones between going commercial and sticking with their hard rock roots.  The whole \\"caught in between\\" period is interesting to me.   <br /> <br />An album worth owning?  Yes.

B00006AW2S|5.0|Listening to \\"Out of Our Heads\\" is almost like listening to two different LP's.  The first 6 songs (Side One) are mostly covers of R&B chestnuts, with \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" being perhaps the most emotive. Which is saying something because the 3 tracks that precede it aren't too shabby either!! The live version of \\"It's All Right\\" is also a killer.  On the next six tracks (Side Two)the boys mostly establish their own identity with their own material, including the definitive \\"Satisfaction.\\"  Either way, you can't lose, the pace transitions from song to song are very well handled, very nice staging!

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have listened to this CD about 7 times now, and it has such a clean and crisp sound. The Acoustic guitar is really prevalent on this record. The drumming is spectacular, as always. Geddy's singing is terrific and his Bass playing is lightening quick. I can't wait for the tour! <br />Songs that stood out for me almost immediately were: Far Cry, Armor & Sword, The Larger Bowl, The Main Monkey Business, Hope and Malignant Narcissism. The others are very close beind, but these songs have a uniqness about them, that I cannot really elaborate just yet.  <br />It is almost the way Vapor Trails took time to grow, and once it did, it was listened to almost every other day for a period of time.  <br />Buy this CD !!!!

B000002P2V|5.0|Who are You is the best Who studio CD ever, hands down. Even better than Who's Next.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|The DVD crams in a TON of anti-globalization propaganda in the extras, stuff to make Gore's \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" look like a 1950s Disney film.  Featuring angst-ridden self-rationalizing extreme-left philosophers and propagandists, such as Naomi Klein and Slavoj Zizek.  Expounding basically the notion that the post-apocalyptic future depicted in the film will happen because of overpopulation and capitalism.  More or less.  Also more or less NOTHING to do with the central premise of the movie, which was mass sterilization happening following a flu epidemic in 2008, and the collapse of civilization following (don't worry, this is reavealed in the first five minutes, if you didn't get it from the commercials).  There is not the slightest metaphorical connection between the movie and the extras. <br /> <br />Which kind of evokes a big \\"WTF?!\\" <br /> <br />Science fiction has long had a tradition of providing \\"fantasy scenarios\\" in which current social problems are debated, often without notice or censure of mainstream society.  For example, Star Trek (TOS) handled everything from the Vietnam War to interracial sex. <br /> <br />But to tack on the anti-globalization extras  to this movie appears to be an effort to hitchhike extremist viewpoints onto a completely dissimilar effort.  Was the studio asleep at the wheel to let this happen? <br /> <br />So, movie: 3 stars, DVD extras a total zero.  The initial release doesn't even have a commentary, which makes one fear a director's cut may be imminent.  I'd say skip it if/when it happens.
B000GFLKF8|3.0|This is one of those movies that probably would have worked better as a novel than a movie.  The slow pacing left a lot to be desired. I was expecting something more brilliant than what was presented here. Dalton Russell's who, what, and when explanation was fine, but he definitely short-changed us on the why.  Why the heck did he care how Case made his money?  None of the robber's where Jewish.  How did he learn of his past if no one else knew?  Once Dalton and Ms. White had their little dicussion, hence, telling the audience the real deal, I was bored waiting for Det. Frazier and his crew to catch up.  Then I wasn't rewarded well enough for the wait.  Why was Dafoe in this movie?  have the acting gigs dried up that badly that he's taking parts that could have easily gone to a glorified extra?  Foster was good, wouldn't mind having her job.  Overall, it's just okay.  I like Washington more when he does character pieces compared to his action/thriller/ heist stuff.  I can rarely tell those characters apart.

B00003CXC7|3.0|Rear Window is the story of a photographer with a broken leg (Jimmy Stewart). He spends his time in his wheelchair confined to his room with little to do but spy on the neighbors. There is a ballerina star, a lonely middle-aged woman, and a married couple. He becomes very interested in the married couple when one day the invalid wife disappears and the husband begins acting strangely. The photographer includes his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), his nurse (Thelma Ritter), and a detective friend in his theory that the man murdered his wife.<br /><br />When one thinks of Hitchcock, thoughts of crimes and plot twists come to mind. This film seems to be much more straightforward. It moves very slowly and none of the big events in the film seem all that major to the audience because most of them happen outside Stewart's apartment building. The most exciting part of the film is of course the ending, but even it is too little too late. If you have high expectations for this film as a constant thrill ride, see another film. You will certainly be disappointed.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Excellent collection of all of Britney's hits.  A must have for Britney fans and a guilty pleasure for any pop music fan.  Whatver you think of Britney's goofy antics in her personal life, she did do some damn good pop music.  Can't help it, the stuff just got stuck in my head.  Good music for when you just want to have fun, not think.  This album demonstrates why Britney was the Queen of Pop for awhile.  Maybe she'll come back someday, maybe she won't.  Doesn't matter, she's made her mark on pop.  Even her detractors prove as much - if she didn't matter, they wouldn't bother.  Good stuff.

0743496728|5.0|'Nineteen Minutes' has to be one of THEE best books I have ever read! (And I've read A LOT of books!) A part of me would like to believe if everyone read this book, it may change our world for the better. I continually worry about my niece and what she goes through at school... pure pressure, teasing, school officials that just look the other way. This should be required reading for all students. Unfortunately, I think school shootings is yet another situation slipping through the cracks. I truly feel things like this could be prevented!!!... metal detectors, better education on socialization, letting kids know that their status in high school will have nothing to do with how they turn out in the real world...

1592401791|5.0|and one that I would highly recommend to any person interested in music and how it is recorded.  Of course having The Beatles as the examples takes this book to another level altogether. <br /> <br />I've read dozens of books about The Fabs and this perspective, which is more of a mature business and professional look instead of one of constant praise and adoration, is extremely interesting.  It brings out a human element that I've not read before...You mean The Beatles were human ?  Yes they were !  In fact, they were the hardest working band around and with the help of Geoff Emerick became the greatest rock group of all times...Without Doubt ! <br /> <br />If you're looking for a great read, please select Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles...It will be worth your time.

0446677450|5.0|This is a motivational book and it does just that.  It makes you think about money in a whole new way.  If you should take the advice, you may have a chance to make a difference in your own life.  One thing I especially like about this book are the references to other great sources of information by other authors.  This lets you know that the ideas and advice presented here are not just one mans theories or ideologies.  I recommend this book to any teen or even grade school child.  The younger a person starts investing, the better off they will be when it comes to retirement and the earlier they will be able to do so.

B000F3T3CS|4.0|This opera is light and entertaining to watch, I enjoyed it for its fun quality and the performances of the lead singers, chorus, set and music. Villazon has a beautiful expressive voice and he can ACT, dance and juggle too; he 'is' the lovelorn swain. He also looks the part which adds to the performance. There is a rapport between Villazon and Netrebko which comes through in their scenes together. For a complete contrast and my 5* rating see their DVD of La Traviata with Hampson.

B00005JSGK|3.0|Hatari! is Howard Hawks at his most laid back. Thankfully not as shrill and manic as his Thirties screwball comedies, this veers totally in the opposite direction with its ambling, almost low-key and virtually plotless look at a group of animal catchers in East Africa who embody all the usual Hawksian stereotypes - likeably gruff but not humourless hero (Wayne), quiet punk kid who makes good (Gerard Blain), professional sidekick (Hardy Kruger), obligatory comic relief (Red Buttons) and game gal (Elsa Martinelliu). It in no way justifies its 157-minute running time, but all the reason Hawks needs is that he likes these people and wants to spend more time with them. Gently entertaining, but at times a little too laid back.<br /><br />Paramount's DVD offers a good transfer with the original theatrical trailer the only extra.
B000PUAHOY|4.0|I asked my friends to go see this movie and they declined, because they didn't want to see a 3 hour movie directed by David Lynch. I think you really have to be a movie buff or film maker to be able to want to see this movie and enjoy it at the same time. It's a total anti-Hollywood movie in many ways. One would wonder if Lynch is attempting career suicide to do a movie that is hardly marketable. I don't think this film was intended to please or draw in any mainstream audiences, maybe that's why there was a group of 5 or 6 audiences seated in front of me walked out after one hour. As for me, I went to see this movie for two obvious reasons, one would be for the bizarre and unconventional work of Lynch, and the other would be to see the many characters played by Laura Dern, who no doubt turned in an Oscar-caliber performance.<br /><br />I really don't know how to explain the plot of the film, because it's like watching a dream or nightmare that's filled with wierd, twisted, imaginative scenes all randomly edited out of chronological order, so it was confusing to follow it. To distinguish the different characters played by Laura Dern was by her wardrobe and makeup and performances at times. I was bored by some of the scenes, but the film was consistently moody, creepy atmoshpere and music score. Some elements in this film confused me like the bunny characters, and the Germen/Polish characters that occasionally appeared and then vanished in a scene didn't make sense. Then there is  a bunch of imaginery dancing prostitutes that added some wierd sexual element to the plot. There was a very memorable scene that served comic relief where the homeless Black woman talks to the homeless Japanese girl while witnessing Laura's character bleeding to death. The scene was so funny even though it was a very tragic moment at the same time.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this film was that it was so home video like because it was shot on digital camera, maybe Lynch intended to make this film looked raw in a way. The supporting actors turned in striking performances. I thought Jeremy Iron was underused and didn't have much of a challenging role. Laura Dern's performance is truly mesmerizing, it's so multi-layered. Honestly, I don't think I am not the only one who feels the need to watch it again to understand this film better.d to make this film looked raw in a way.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|This movie possessed a well-developed plot full of surprises up until the very end.  The political context of the film gave it some relevance, and gives the viewer something to think about...at the same time, this can't be categorized as a 'message movie', as the message isn't too overbearing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|If you want to know 5 (or 6) essential things about the new Rush release \\"Snakes & Arrows\\", this review is for you. <br /> <br />1.  \\"Far Cry\\" is probably the most well-composed and best-executed single track that Rush has produced in the past 10 years.  I know that's going out on a limb, but that's the way it sounds to me.  Why?  Well, it really makes great use of the bass-following-guitar-groove thing that the band brought on hot and heavy  - and to excellent effect - in \\"One Little Victory\\" from 2002's Vapor Trails.  The verse, chorus, and bridge all flow together organically as the song's lyric brings it together perfectly.  To quote a well-informed friend who knows Rush's music well, but isn't necessarily the biggest fan of the band, \\"This song sounds the way contemporary Rush and rock SHOULD sound...this is Rush updating their classic tone - it's real evolution\\".  <br /> <br />2.  Significant use of layered vocals and harmonies: This Rush CD has the most extensive use of layered vocal effects and harmonies that I remember on any of their work to date.  To my ears, it is very reminiscent of what can be heard initially on Geddy Lee's 2000 \\"My Favourite Headache\\".  I really love that CD, so it sounds particularly good to me.  Those that prefer the traditional, single \\"voice\\" of classic Rush will notice this right away.  Some might say it makes the music sound a bit more commercially viable.  I personally think it makes the vocals more powerful, and also compliments the mellower and more balanced approach Geddy has brought to his voice over the years.  Geddy's voice has proved to be like a fine wine, getting better with age. <br /> <br />3.  Acoustic guitar is everywhere:  I recall reading that Alex Lifeson wrote much of his contributions to the material for this CD on an acoustic guitar.  It sounds like it, as acoustic guitar tracks can be heard on just about every tune.  Most of the time it's great.  However, at other times - it sounds a bit forced into the cracks and corners of songs, and seems to pops up in places where it just might not belong.  Listen and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />4.  There are 3 instrumental tracks on this record...with \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" sounding the best to me, and also the most \\"Rushlike\\".  This is not just because there are solo breaks in it that are reminiscent of those in the 1981 classic \\"YYZ\\", but because the song is short, compact, and more thematic. The other \\"performance instrumental\\" on the CD -  \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" - is a bit too long, kind of wanders, and seems to suffer from lack of a memorable melody or theme.  \\"Monkey\\" is an interesting tune, but it's probably of most interest to bass players out there who continue to be inspired by Geddy's magnificent playing.   I really like the third instrumental song on the CD, \\"Hope\\", which is a guitar instrumental that sounds more like Led Zeppelin circa \\"Physical Graffiti\\" than \\"Broon's Bane\\" from \\"Exit Stage Left\\".  I can't be sure, but I think Alex used an open tuning guitar technique on this song.  If so, I think it's the only open tuning piece I've ever heard him do.  I'm open to correction on this one, though. <br /> <br />5.  Improved sound/production quality:  If you're like me, you really didn't like the production and sound quality of 2002's \\"Vapor Trails\\".  I know the band wasn't especially happy with the results, either.  I have to say this release sounds GREAT, and achieves the low-end punch and growl that Lifeson famously pushed for on \\"Vapor\\", without losing any sonic highs or tonal quality.  <br /> <br />6. The return of Lifeson guitar solos:  Yes, they're Ba-ack!  Ale x ends his self-imposed moratorium on guitar solos this time around.  Completely absent from \\"Vapor\\", they return on Snakes, and I think with somewhat mixed results.  Some of the solos are very good, while others, well...are noisy, and lack discernible melody and phrasing.  Overall, I think Alex is appropriately less interested in flash these daysthan he is in sound and texture - and that's a good thing.  There is no solo in \\"Far Cry\\", which was absolutely the right choice.  In the break where a guitar solo would have been in the old days, Alex chose to do a tonal, ascending, feed-backy thing that works great for the song.   I think the best solos on the record are those in \\"Good News First\\" and \\"Bravest Face\\".  The former is classic Lifeson, where he makes great use of harmonics, open strings, and tremolo vibrato - think the solo in Limelight, just not as dramatic.  It really is his signature kind of soloing.  The latter is a jazzy, clean guitar solo that is fun to listen to, and demonstrates a style of playing that you don't normally hear from Alex.
B00002E23E|5.0|I am biased because i love Zeppelin and have done for over 30 years but Song Remains the Same is just a fantastic insight into the band and an awesome display of live music. Not many bands sound better live than their studio albums but Zeppelin pull it off, from Plants awesome vocals to Pages screaming guitar this album just blows you away!

B000PUAHOY|5.0|I'm not sure what David wanted to accomplish,if anything with this film,but I think that film students could definately learn things from it.For one,this film PROVES that anyone(with talent)can create an interesting,stylish film without a billion-dollar hollywood budget.I just started taking film courses in college this year,so the entire time I was transfixed to the screenwhen I saw it in the theater I would find myself stepping back from the experience to do quick physical/psychological dissections of what I saw and felt:this film allows the viewer a smorgasborg of oppurtunities for this!Some of the scenes in it which were only a minute or so long actually carried more to them than some of the lengthly ones,which I found cool.Anyway,great experimental,neo-noir/psychological-horror film which any fan of film as an art should enjoy.<br /><br />Rhino is said to have the dvd on the way June 8th or so,\\"loaded with extras\\" as Lynch himself said!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This was a great movie, and was shipped in a reasonable time, and was in great condition just as described.  Would deffinately do business again.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|WOW - A great James Bond movie.  Very entertaining.  HE is gorgeous!  Thank you again. <br />Pat
B0002JP4L4|4.0|I loved this movie in highschool.  Now my daughters can enjoy it too!!  It was fun seeing the actors all grown up.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Over 5 hours of Led Zeppelin Live and most of it you wouldnt have seen before.Footage of when they were up and coming and footage of them at their peak. The audio is unbelievably good as is the video. A must have for any Zeppelin freak like me!!!
B000000OMB|2.0|no me gusto para nada, tal vez si la hubiera escuchado 25 años atras hubiera estado buena.
0743267478|5.0|Q & A is a very entertaining book on many levels.  The view of Indian culture, the inclusion of crimes against humanity we see around the world, and the organizational structure of the novel itself create a fascinating story.  You cannot help rooting for the underdog, even with his flaws.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I came accross Planet Earth a little late, after most of the episodes were broadcast on the Discovery Channel.  I loved the episodes, but was annoyed by the narration.  It wasn't Sigorney Weaver's voice or anything, but I soon grew tired of how many time she said that the footage was the first time this behavior was ever filmed, or the first time ...... It seemed too puffed up.  I didn't want to hear about how awesome they thought they were because of this footage.  But I loved the series overall, so when I saw it at my local Costco (for a similar price as on Amazon), I went for it.  I much prefer David Attenborough's narration.  The show is pretty much apolitical - you're not going to have to listen to a bunch of 'mankind is horrible' talk.  I think this makes it much more effective in getting the point accross to protect the environment as it doesn't offend conservatives like me.   <br /> <br />I think my favorite parts are the diaries.  It's amazing what the photographers and everyone else had to deal with to film all these scenes.  The funniest moment of the whole set is the guy who filmed the bird of paradise footage.   <br /> <br />Great set that I think everybody should get.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This was a good film but not great.  The best adaptation of Jane Austen's classic book is the 5-hour miniseries created for A&E.  In my opinion it sets the gold standard and is the version to which I compare every other version. <br /> <br />However Keira Knightly makes a very good Elizabeth Bennett and McFadyen's Darcy is definitely worth looking at (I may be a \\"mom of 5\\" but my mom taught me that you're never to old to appreciate a fine looking man).  Oh and he has a great voice. <br /> <br />This film takes liberties with the story, such as changing event settings.  For instance, in the book, Darcy did not propose to Lizzie in the pouring rain on a picturesque stone gazebo or mausoleum or whatever with a great view in the background.  However, I did enjoy the scene they added of Mr. Bingley and Darcy practicing how Bingley would propose to Jane. <br /> <br />Overall I found the story a bit confusing and hard to follow - and I have read the book at least a dozen times.  I can't imagine how someone who never read the book would be able to follow the storyline in this movie. <br /> <br />Donald Sutherland seems somewhat miscast as Mr. Bennett.  I guess I'm a purist - they should have cast a Brit.  And every time he laughed he had to put his hand over his mouth - I assume to hold his dentures in.  It was very distracting for me. <br /> <br />Overall, this was an enjoyable movie and I recommend it.  But if you haven't already seen the A&E version, it is a must.
B000O1799U|3.0|Again a well- made but really slow moving movie. This is the movie of the broadway show about a girl band from the 60's that is based loosely on the Supremes. As I wrote the actors are really good but there is really too much singing (OK, I know it is a musical...) and it sometimes is not fosued enough on the story because of this. While at one point musicals were a Hollywood speciality, here they employ actors that are not all greatly suited. OK the women are great singers but are they actresses also...Anyway it is beautigul to watch but too long and some of the singing numbers reallly drag on forever.
B00028HBKC|5.0|When i first watched this i was dumbfounded. If you can watch this and not be moved, check your pulse.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I must admit, I didn't know what to think when a friend recommended this to me, but I ended up enjoying this movie completly.  It was hysterically funny, with some absolutely brilliant scenes which accurately describe life in any office, but particularly in the computer biz.  Very witty and apt commentary on the things that go wrong with bad (or even average) leadership.
1582701709|1.0|THIS IS FOR SURE A SELF-HELP BOOK, BUT STILL A DIFFERENT KIND OF IDEA ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SECRET. I STILL DON'T GET IT TO BE HONEST WHAT IS THE SECRET BUT POSITIVE THINKING AND IN SOME WAYS WISH FULL THINKING. <br />I DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WAS SUCH A BIG BIG SECRET. <br /> <br />IN MY OPINION NOTHING COMES TO YOU WITHOUT HARD WORK, EDUCATION, AND MONEY. <br />SO MAYBE NEXT TIME CALL THE BOOK.... FOOL YOURSELF TO THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET RICH SECRET....
B00001U0DP|5.0|So much taste in the story telling, only an italian could do it!
B000B8QEYC|2.0|Not much new here.  Enya's voice is as beautiful as ever but the songs sound pretty much the same as the ones on all of her earlier recordings.  The title piece, \\"Amarantine,\\" I find to be annoying.  If I listen to this track the refrain just plays over and over in my head afterwords and drives me nuts - because its just the one word Amarantine. Over and over and over and over..... AAAAAAAAARRRGGGGG! Now when I play this CD, in the interest of my sanity, I just skip over this track.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Reminds me of 'I Heart Huckabees.\\"  It's existential in nature if you look past the comedy.  It's a great movie I'd recommend.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I like this show so much. It's original, scary, funny and the actors are good. Everyone will like this show.
0440237688|1.0|This book has generally been described as a book about a utopia, while we ignore the pressing issue: this book is a dystopia.  Much more that a miscategorization, this book is generally poorly written.  With little to no figurative language, how can we expect our children to learn to write while reading just the basics of language.  Metaphors and irony make political commentaries good.<br /><br />There are also logical errors in her book.  It does not follow that death and leaving the bounds of the community would have the same consequence, yet in The Giver, they do.  There are much better books that offer much the same message of The Giver while using better language and better logic like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Anthem, and 1984.  If we are looking to educate on a dystopia, any of those books would provide much more substance.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|Too much...too much sophistication accurately describes this film. I realize not being able to understand the foreign languages was the crux of the film, but come on! At first, I thought the DVD was defective because I couldn't produce the sub-titles. When I finally realized I was mistaken, not only was I frustrated, I also felt stupid. Yes the performances were on target, especially the nanny character played by Adrianna Barraza. And the child actors were great! The reason I gave this film two stars is because of the effort needed on behalf of the viewer to enjoy this film. If it's a documentary, then make it a documentary; if not, put us (the audience) in a position to both enjoy and understand the plot instead of clubbing us in the head with our inabilities and insecurities. I'm not saying don't see it; however, I am saying be emotionally forewarned.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband's birthday and what a winner! Everyone should own a copy so we can remember how Planet Earth should be cherished and not destroyed. It's the most beautiful visuals and amazing stories nature has put on earth for humans to behold. We all need to value it like we value insignificant things like (gold, diamond and yes the almighty dollar). Shame on us....we are so stupid to be so remiss in taking care of the only place in the universe we can truly call home. I hope this incredible documentary is a wake up call for the world. I recommend the BBC David Attenborough version over Sigorney Weaver- his voice suits this film much better.
B000E6FSPW|5.0|if you love the athems of the 80's. then this is just perfect!i use to own the album, now it's great to have this in a remastered cd format! listen to it loud and enjoy!!
0757302661|5.0|I found this book to be highly informative and interesting. It is a very easy read (I finished it within a day or two), and it gives you a good understanding of why hypnobirthing works from a biological perspective as well as practical tips for using the techniques during birth. I have subsequently decided to take a course so that my fiance can be more fully involved, but I think the book alone would help you manage your birth more effectively.
B00005JPCF|5.0|My 20 month old daughter loves it so much, we have to watch it about 3 times a day. She dances to all the songs in the movie.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|This may be; no, this is Will Smith's best work to date. Even the Ali performance was more Smith than Ali. Some actors have such big personalities that it's hard to see them as the characters they're trying to portray. Except for 'The Legends of Bagger Vance' and the 'Fresh Prince' characters, most of Will Smith's performances have fallen into this category; which is hard to believe given his bankability. But 'The Pursuit of Happyness,' may take Will Smith's career in a new direction. I know he's already successful, I'm referring to his ability to play more realistic down to earth characters; characters with more substance. I usually approach these type (a black-man struggles to prove himself worthy and make it in a predominantly white mans field) films with a bit of trepidation. In truth, I generally hate these type films, because I'm always forced to ask myself why? Why do black men seeminlgly have such a hard time (both past and present) in a country that touts fairness and equality as it's cornerstone in the job market, the courts, etc. But this film was a refreshing departure from the quintessential feel-racially-sorry for that guy piece. It was a vindication of sorts for the determined. Smith finally takes you to a place where you momentarily forget it's him and follow the character. The performance by his son was also believable. Be advised though, the character had so many set backs it get's a bit tiresome to watch him rebound yet again. I would've liked to see the Chris Gardner character enjoy some of his well-deserved success. Living with new-found success is sometimes just as hard as the pursuit. This film ultimately works because of it's refreshingly new approach. Since it was directed by Italian director Gabriele Muccino, it's a film that centers on undying determination, not race!
B000059T00|4.0|After groveling in the hovels of dark cafes and zoos after midnight, I finally emerged to the meditative mountain for a quick, few, inspirational visionary episodes. What meditative mountain you ask? I am a Seer- of course I have one. Anyway-through the haze- I was able to see many things concerning this album. And seeing isn't always good when you're asked to take them on Blind Faith alone. Regardless- it certainly is more pleasant reviewing this than having my locks changed in my castle (yes, again!). It's amazing what fans will do. Oh well.<br /><br />I have to be honest here, you have to look at this album in context if you are to get anywhere. Yes, yes, I love it too. But honestly, is there anyone out there that really, sincerely believes that this is the best they could do? I certainly don't. I think this was meant as a side project only for Clapton and Winwood, in between groups or group obligations. Why isn't it the best?  You only have to look closely at what came after - Winwood's \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\", and Eric's \\"Layla\\". Now THOSE are highpoints my people. Blind Faith has many pleasurable moments here - and wonderful musicianship. But nothing really lifts you more than three inches off the ground.<br /><br />Which is not to say that there aren't superb gems. The subtle, quiet yearning of Winwood with great acoustic guitars on \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\". Listen to the insistent snaking along of the beat and Winwood's soulful plea at the end. Wonderful. Too bad everything was not like this.<br /><br />\\"Had to Cry Today\\" has an interesting riff to recommend it- and it flys off and returns to us time and time again. But the song itself labors along and the best part is the lead guitar interplay between Winwood and Clapton. I will say this- at least those two have some idea of where all this is going.  But Ginger Baker and Rick Grech, although both extremely talented, are overshadowed.<br /><br />Ironically, one of the few songs that show any real life here, \\"Well All Right\\" was not written by any of the group members but was a Buddy Holly tune. And Winwood share's his piano gifts with us here. Nice jam at the end Steve!<br /><br />\\"Presence of the Lord\\" is a Clapton tune and a lumbering (or is it slumbering?) one at that. And one has to wonder if this was before, during, or after his heroin addiction? I would hate to think the Lord had anything to do with that! In fairness, the thing that saves this song is the middle break when the Lord allows Clapton the freedom of a lead. As a Seer I know that we must be grateful for small miracles in our lives.<br /><br />But all is not lost because we are on \\"The Sea of Joy\\". I rather like this one. It has some life and could have been included on a Traffic album like \\"Low Spark\\". However, that being said, Mr. Winwood does himself (and us) no favors by writing this in a bad key for himself. I've always liked the sound of his vocals, but his voice is straining here to hit the notes. I am advising honey and no speaking for three days to get up to snuff. That Metamorpho-always willing to help.<br /><br />We conclude with \\"Do What You Like\\", a long, floating, noodling of a song that gives everyone the spotlight leading up to the famed Ginger Baker drum solo. Well, after all, he wrote the song. I sort of like this jam though. They finally let Baker and Grech shine just when I was beginning to get worried....about the time the doorknob broke.<br /><br />In conclusion, is this the best thing these musicians have ever done? The answer is no. Are there some fine and plausible musical substance that would make this a worthy find? Definitely. Anything Clapton and Winwood get involved with is definitely worth a look see. But a super-group? Well........almost.<br /><br />Now it is time to get down from this mountain and get some insect spray. All I need are mosquito bites on my face. After all, I have a public to think of!<br /><br />Slightly overcooked but far from done--as always-- Metamorpho
1878424777|5.0|This book should be required reading in every school, in every country!  It contains some very basic and practical wisdom that is relatively easy to understand but, not easy to practice.  We must replace most of our current beliefs (concepts we blindly accepted as truth, early in life) because they sabotage our lives and relationships.  As human members of this planet, until we truly \\"get it\\", we are doomed to suffer and cause suffering. <br />This has nothing to do with religion.  Although, it's based on ancient Toltec wisdom, the teachings allow for everyone to see reality the way they wish.  The goal of this book is to show/remind us all how to be happy and respect others.  If enough people practice these agreements, it could eventually lead to world peace!
0374105235|5.0|I found this to be one of those books that I could not put down.  The story is based on the author's first-person account with the horrors of war in Sierra Leone, as seen through the eyes of a child. <br /> <br />It does not dramatize this experience, but gives a day-by-day account of simply trying to survive. <br /> <br />Outside countries have heard so very little about this ongoing civil upset, that accounts like this are so very important in informing the world about the very real horrors that continue to exist.  Extremely well-written.
B00005JPFH|4.0|\\"Spider-man 3\\" was fairly enjoyable, featuring a fine set of villains, and a story in line with the previous films, though I do feel the whole \\"black-suit\\" thing went on for a bit long and that the Venom scenes (which I was looking forward to the most) were a bit rushed, as was Venom's character development. The ending was a little up in the air in some ways too. A little under 4 stars, I think.
1594481717|5.0|I think every person in the US should read this book. The implications for all of us are overwhelming and the need for funding for the arts is compelling. The need for the arts, according to Pink, is economic. I bought a copy of this book for my middle school principal and the superintendent of our school district. After reading the book, I had the opportunity to hear Pink speak....WOW!
B00013RC8O|5.0|This movie, though dated, contains so much clear imagery of the processes that drive men (sometimes to their own destruction) that I had to have a copy of my own for a constant reminder.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Great album if you like the Clash. In fact if you like the Clash you should already have this. I had it on vinyl and decided to replace it with CD now that I've done away with my turntable. <br /> <br />Five stars for anyone who likes the Clash. Otherwise it could range between zero and five stars, but isn't that how music always is? Amazon recommended \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" by the Sex Pistols to be purchased with this CD, and both are great but I much prefer \\"London Calling\\" in my old age of 45. I still crank up my car stereo when I play either one on the highway and suggest you do so as well, preferably with the windows down and a good breeze. It's just one of those albums that feels better that way! <br /> <br />Not sure if I spelled \\"sattamassaganna\\" correctly in my title for this review, but this is the only album I know with that word on it. <br /> <br />Definitely worth far more than the $8.99 price. I ordered this at the same time I ordered Rockpile's \\"Seconds of Pleasure\\", a completely different style of album from about the same time-- both are worthy of places in the collection of anyone who likes music from around the 1979-80 time frame. That was a time of many styles of music, many of which are now classics, including \\"London Calling\\".
B000MXPE7Y|3.0|I was sure I would love this movie based on the cast alone.  But it was soooooo slow.  I doubt if I watch it again.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|This is her best CD yet.  The tunes are catchy and hot.
B000NA28IE|5.0|I don't read the book yet, but I saw the movie and I love it. Maybe is not the best adventure movie, but is great. I love Saphira and of course, Eragon. I bought the special edition, because have an interview with Christopher Paolini and bonus materials. Great movie!
B000O178BY|3.0|If you're a fan of NIN, concept albums, or post-apocalyptic dystopia, then this CD is for you.  The music is great, closer to older NIN than recent more rock-like releases, but still accessible for those who don't want to hear just a wall of distortion and noise.  The cd packaging is half of the fun, since it fully embraces the sci-fi concept and has great art and design.<br /><br />Buy the CD.  Unlike so many current albums, there is actually a value to buying the physical CD instead of just downloading the single online.  An excellent addition to any collection.
6305736650|4.0|Like so many movies out there in the late thirties and early forties.Humphrey Bogart,Ingrid Bergman,Claude Rains and Peter Lorre.Anything with Lorre in is good to me.Its a movie I can watch over and over and not get sick of it.It was playing in a theater near where I live but the time was 1:00 pm during the weekends.Its gone now pity I really would of loved to see it on the big screen.
B000MRA5EM|2.0|music drowns out audio. why have a naration if the music makes it not possible to hear.
