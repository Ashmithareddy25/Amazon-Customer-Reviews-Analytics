B005GG0MIS|5.0|i never paid much attention to politics until now. Wished i had known more earlier. It seems very sensible that all the presidents past and present are supportive of each other.Tough office.
B0045HCJRG|4.0|Just plain fun. Christopher Walken at his best. Nice character development and each scene is truly entertaining and laugh out loud funny.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|By the time I got my hands on this book, I was already an avid fan of Gillian Flynn because of Gone Girl. The blurb didn't really appeal to me that much and that's why I read it last. I honestly think Camille is the most screwed up of all the author's characters. I mean, going in I already know she'd be in some way twisted but it's not until Camille revealed the reason for her stay in a psych hospital that I realized just how much.<br /><br />SPOILER: From the blurb I thought she has tattoos all over her body because she has some sort of addiction with them. She is addicted...but hers is so much more chilling. I seriously had no idea she was a cutter until she admitted to the fact. And she doesn't just cut...she cuts words and her body is literally covered with them except for her face and a small part that she can't reach on her back. END OF SPOILER.<br /><br />I don't know why, but out of all the characters that the author has created, I feel sorry for Camille the most. She's a classic example of the poor little rich girl, growing up privileged but yearning for her mother's love. She is beautiful but extremely broken and scarred. It doesn't really help that her family, from whom she wanted acceptance, is the reason she's so screwed up. Half the time I was reading I wanted to shake some sense into Camille, especially for letting herself get manipulated by a 13-year-old girl.<br /><br />The book has a gothic feel to it, like being sucked into a backwards town full of dark secrets. There are so many mysteries to uncover and a lot of them are unexpected. Because this is the author's first novel, it somehow has a different feel from the others, the narrative more traditional than her later books. Overall, I really enjoyed uncovering the mysteries of Sharp Objects, and it turned out to be so much more than I expected.<br /><br />This review is also available at: [...]
B002SJIO54|5.0|Great story and very unique way of telling it through common social issues. Great acting but could use less &#34;F-bombs&#34;.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|I am going to keep it short and straight to the point. I am a big fan of Only By The Night, so that might tell you what I enjoy from Kings of Leon. At first I didn't enjoy this album very much. Not many songs reached out to me where I need to listen to it again right away. However, I went for a 2 hour walk and listened to the album again and I came away enjoying it. The more I listened to the album the more it grew on me. If you are a Kings of Leon fan, go buy this album. If you like rock music and want to listen to something new, I recommend this album. I am not going to talk about the individual songs because everybody likes something different. Just pick the album up and give it a shot.
B00F91H15W|3.0|I expected to be better. I was kind of disappointed seems a little low budget. We were hoping that they would have developed the characters more.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Awesome book. Totally enjoyed. Begins quick like all his books. Ends great. The days of filming the the documentary got a little long but never boring, you just knew there was more going on and I couldn't wait to get to it.
B00BIQZQPE|5.0|Awesome book especially for a beginner like me!!!! I keep going back to this book more and more I learn something each time I go through it.
B000002GXS|5.0|fantastic album,  one you can enjoy from start to finish.  worth a listen if you're a waits fan or just discovered his music.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|loved J Carrey's movies from the 90s, his best work in my opinion. movie that jump started Cameron Diaz career, would recommend
1416955070|5.0|chose this book because of the cover and synopsis on the back. Interesting and gripping...would recommend to scify and fantasy readers.
B0058YPG1G|3.0|Why can't it just play through???  Why does it just stop??  Sometimes it stops and if you wait a minute it starts again.<br />Other times it just stalls and I have to fast forward it<br />J. Yuzzi
1416972242|5.0|Love this book... In fact, I love the whole series... gripping and intense.. makes you consider if there actually are Nephilim.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|It's a classic for me. It's fun and my kids love the music. I think it's just a good goto movie for the whole family.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I WATCHED THE TRAILER LAST SPRING AND COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL IT WAS RELEASED AS A DVD. I LOVE SCI-FI AND THIS MOVIE WAS RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE LATEST STAR TREK MOVIE.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|My kids loved this movie and I enjoyed it too.  I think it's just at good as the Shrek movies. I would recommend it for the whole family.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|BOUGHT THIS FLICK FOR MY WIFE. SHE WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE TRAILERS SHE HAD SEEN. ONCE SHE VIEWED IT, SHE IMMEDIATLY PASSED IT ON TO A GIRLFRIEND AND TOLD HER TO KEEP IT!
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Dream Theater is my absolute favorite band. Admittedly, I don't think they could ever disappoint me, but this new offering is still an evolution of their previous work. It has all the hallmarks of a Dream Theater album, instrumental opening, heavy tracks with tons of solos, and an epic piece to tie it all together.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|How i met your mother is so ridiculously funny already and now its totally covenient on instant video! I can watch whenever I want on all my devices.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|A7X continues to get heavier and nastier with each release, but still maintains the creativity it showed on the self-titled release in 2007. That album was probably the height of their creativity, but this album manages to create some interesting ambiance on &#34;Acid Rain&#34;, and a pretty haunting vocal harmony intro on &#34;Requiem&#34;. Most of the other tracks are heavy and mid to moderately uptempo, with cool dual leads, driving riffs, strong vocals, and good drumming.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Boy, if people really understood everything presented in this movie we would easily eliminate the Fed and central banking from our country.  The collapse of our economy in the &#34;housing crisis&#34; was absolutely created intentionally.  Unbelievable that we are so easy dupped into believing we are responsible to pay for this crisis... we walk away from our homes, hand over generations of our family wealth, and accept that we saddle our future family with the bill for all these foreclosed homes.<br /><br />The big banks create the collapse, they take out insurance (credit default swaps) on our mortgages so they get paid 100% when the loan is 90 days past due, then they ALSO repossess our homes (with no consideration for how much has been paid), sell them, and all the while they ALSO get money printed for &#34;bail outs&#34; to cover their losses... when they've been paid several times over already.<br /><br />THEN, our future generations are expected to pay off all this &#34;bail out&#34; -- essentially paying for homes that they will never get.<br /><br />This is so twisted that no good citizen can face it or believe it.  And that's exactly why it can happen.<br /><br />The most disturbing part of this is that our forefathers fought and died to establish a country free from this danger.  In only 250 years, we've succeeded to set aside the ideals they established and hand over our wealth and future to these criminals.  Scarey.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If more science fiction were written and cast half as well as this movie I would get out to the theater more.  Granted, you should watch the Firefly series before seeing this film as this is more or less the &#34;final episode&#34;.  It pains me to say that, because like many Browncoats we are in denial that the series is over and will not return.  Buy them, own them, and watch them repeatedly.  You will not regret it. The characters are fantastic.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|A very fine example that disproves the commonly-held notion that movie casts for popular fiction paperback always turn out sub-par.
B001EN71CW|5.0|If you have not been introduced to the Firefly &#34;Verse&#34; you are missing a great future world, which is a mix of old and new.  No aliens (sorry Mr. Spielberg) just people, with the same issues people have had since the beginning of time, trying to make the best of their particular predicament.  At first I was skeptical about watching a 'space western', but Wedon and company have created an intriguing world with compelling characters.  The humor, compassion, and personal struggles of the main characters unfold as the series progresses and you slowly develop an appreciation and affinity for each character. It doesn't surprise me that the show was canceled after 14 episodes (only 13 aired), but Fox made a big mistake not giving this series another season to build it's already fanatical fan base. Buy this series, own it, and watch them repeatedly.  You will not regret it. The characters are fantastic. The one negative comment, I wish they would have included the spoken intros that accompanied the aired versions at least as a special feature. Keep flying. You can't take the sky from me since I found Serenity.
0446556750|5.0|Love Michael Connelly and love the Lincoln Lawyer Series.  I had surgery on my foot and spent my recovery period with this series.  Made the recover much better and faster.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I like this game a lot, it has been very fun. No problems with it, plays well and just super fun.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A very touching tale of love, life, and death. I laughed and cried, sometimes at the same time. I highly recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This app comes in handy when i'm doing something and using Pandora on my Kindle. That way I can see the big clock from a distance if I need to. Not to mention you can turn the light on it up and down. The only thing I was not happy about is you don't get all the options it can do without paying more for the app. But, oh well. It's a handy clock.
0895260131|5.0|Everyone needs to know the real story.  The storm is gathering. The victory is already won.  Check out this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|This was an ok book just slow to me. It was worth reading but not for the price. I would definitely read it for $.99.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's just awsome<br />Really should get it if you read the other books are you would be confused with it
B00E95ED32|1.0|I have no idea what people are raving about. This is just terrible. It's all that is wrong and terrible in Electronic Music. Cheeseball Cotton Candy Country House for the unintelligent masses. Enjoy.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Great movie with an excellent moral and plot twist.  Great actors, as well!  I would recommend that people see this file, especially if they like quirky directors like Wes Anderson.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written story with some surprising turns.  Loved the story development and the insight to the mind of a quad. My opinion of the characters changed over time
B0034C9CFK|4.0|Another good cd by Alan Jackson, he's been around for years, his voice is as good as ever, especially on the fast Freight Train, the cd is a nice mix of fast and slow songs, it's a must for any A J fan
0812550706|5.0|I read this in 9th grade. Decide to re-read the book before the movie comes out in November. Great read. Just as good as I remembered it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is really fun in the beginning but when you get further in the game it gets a little boring because it takes so long for new items to become available.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I've only been playing for a few minutes and seems fun and not too difficult.  Can give an update in a few weeks.
B008Y212PI|5.0|the plctures are great and they are a real challenge.  I thought it might be boring but was pleasantly surprised to find myself playing for hours at a time.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes challenging puzzles.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My favorite part about this alarm is the bells tone. It's not too harsh, but rather pleasant to wake up to. That is very important to me. Sounds rather like a deep church bell playing a soft little tune.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|I ordered this movie to be mailed to my son.  I have not seen this movie myself.  The rating of 4 stars references my son's opinion.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The author's idea of building a coherent and enjoyable story around a collection of extra - ordinary photographs was mostly successful. I admired his imagination.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Best alarm app i have used so far. Many options that are easy to select and change as needed. Looking forward to updates!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki is one of our era's greatest animators, and this is his masterpiece. At first he was not going to release it outside of Japan. We can thank the Walt Disney Company for negotiating a broader release and shepherding it along. Many of Miyazaki's films are outstanding, but in my estimation this one tops them all.

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|So many grand themes explored... What it means to be human, the bonds of family, politics of animal rights, perils and prizes of academic research, the promise and pitfalls if memory, just to name a few.. All in an incredibly moving, wrenchingly personal narrative<br />Not an easy feat to pull off as a writer...brava, Ms fowler

B003L5BRXK|5.0|I have a confession, I am a 59 year-old guitarist who loves the Stones but until now I've never owned a copy of &#34;Exile On Mainstreet.&#34;  Oh I've heard it before many times, at friend's houses, on the radio, etc.  I downloaded it this week (shamefully because of a $5 Amazon special) and have been blasting it in my car (iPhone -&#62; cable -&#62; car audio system) every day since.<br /><br />In a world of Autotune, this music sounds very real to me.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|The narrator described the events of the novel from the viewpoint of a brilliant young teen with Asperger's syndrome.  While this viewpoint limited the beauty of the prose, the overall effect was eye-opening and innovative.  I thought it was terrific.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Loved this book! Interesting characters unique setting. Plenty of mystery to be explored. Very nicely done.<br />I like how the author finished up Jordan's &#34; Wheel of Time &#34; series and decided to give some of his own work a try. I'm very glad I did!
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|I love how the mainstream press all influence each other and basically end up writing the same review for a film while jumping on their own self-made bandwagons. The media was so obsessed with the fact that Will Smith would have the audacity to appear onscreen with his son Jaden in a movie helmed by a \\"failed\\" director that they couldn't just enjoy \\"After Earth\\" for what it is. It's a sci-fi movie filled with action and suspense and a deeper meaning at its center.<br /><br />Enroute to another planet, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) and his father Cypher (Will Smith) must make an emergency crash-landing on one of the deadliest worlds in their solar system - Earth. The human race was forced to leave the planet after generations of destroying and depleting it of its natural resources. Left to its own devices, Earth has become a wild kingdom of dangerous and deadly plant and animal life. Their ship split in two, Kitai must make his way across dangerous terrain to recover an electronic signal which will call for a rescue team.<br /><br />\\"After Earth\\" is about the relationship between a father and son. It shows how a father can have unreachable expectations for his offspring but mean well at the same time. It's also a movie about overcoming your fears and doing what you have to do to survive. Lastly, it shows one boy's journey to becoming a man - not because he wants to, but because he has to.<br /><br />Whether you want to admit it or not, every male child wants to win the approval of their father. \\"After Earth\\" captures this perfectly. Everything Jaden Smith's character does during his hero's journey is based upon what he thinks his father would do.<br /><br />I really don't understand where the animosity toward Jaden Smith comes from. He's actually quite a good little actor. The emotions he runs through in \\"After Earth\\" come across as genuine and his interactions with real and CGI characters and beasts are convincing. Again, I think the media wanted to hate this kid from the get-go and just spread the disease from one outlet to the next.<br /><br />The CGI and special effects in \\"After Earth\\" were well-executed for the most part. They weren't perfect by any means. There were parts you could tell were obviously digitally animated. However, for the most part everything looked good.<br /><br />\\"After Earth\\" is rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and some disturbing images. I can't even recall there being any bad language in the film at all. I would suggest it for anyone over the age of 13 and can see where a father and son could use it as a portal to communicating with each other and bonding. Contrary to what many have said, I didn't picked up any strong or dangerous Scientology messages being thrown at audiences.<br />The DVD version of \\"After Earth\\" contains a few entertaining special features. \\"A Father's Legacy\\" shows us Jaden and Will Smith working on and off-screen together. \\"1,000 Years in 300 Seconds\\" takes viewers behind the scenes and on location with the cast and crew. \\"The Nature of the Future\\" gives us an upfront and personal view of the landscapes used in the film. Jaden Smith introduces the winning video of a contest people entered called \\"Xprize 'After Earth.'\\"<br /><br />\\"After Earth\\" is a casualty of pre-conceived notions by the press. People responded to the film based on the fact that Will Smith was supposedly shoving his son down our throats in a movie made by a director who's hit a couple bumps in his career recently, but still has more good features under his belt than bad. Judged on its own, \\"After Earth\\" is a touching and action-packed sci-fi film with something to say about relationships between a father and son.he get-go and just spread the disease from one outlet to the next.<br /><br />The CGI and special effects in \\"After Earth\\" were well-executed for the most part.

B008Y212PI|4.0|So far, it has been error free, a big plus!<br /><br />I am almost finished with the 10x10 grids.  A little frusted in that some grids are 10x7 or 10x8 instead of 10 x 10.<br /><br />I put this app on my tablet the day is was free app of the day.  Not I would like to download it to my phone; I am unable to find it in the listing of my apps.  Searching for words in the name of the title did not work.  Will give back the missing star when it shows up again for installation on my phone (or some explanation why I cannot install it on my phone).  .
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great so far.  I have only been playing for a few days.  I need more practice with Yoda and young Anakin, they can be frustrating, but still enjoying the game.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Years ago, like millions of readers, I read THE SHINING and was scared out of my head. Following that piece of work by Stephen King, I read everything I could get my hands on, from PET CEMETERY, to IT, to SALEM'S LOT, and the list goes on and on. Every time a new book would come out, I had to read it. Though not written so much to be scary, it finds the little boy Danny, grown up and having issues with alcohol. While overcoming his addiction, his shining (the gift he has) brings him in contact with a young girl (a few years have passed during the story). With a great conclusion to this story line, King has made me glad to be a reader.

This is a great show that I only started watching after the finale last week.  I will get all of the seasons as I am totally hooked.  I rate this equal to or better than my favorite show of all time The Sopranos.

B00CVQYMB4|5.0|I read all Rhonda's books. Even though I believe in everything she says, I like the idea of reinforcement and a reminder from reading excerpts. The pages or passages are not numbered or dated so you can just experience the book in any way you want. You can go page by page or just open the book randomly.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|Horror movie with what starts as a bunch of bad boys who mugged a woman and ends with you cheering for the boys and the woman. Don't want to do any spoilers, just will say ending will surprise you and have you yelling at your tv. Excellent movie especially getting ready for scary night movie watching.

B000002UB3|5.0|Arguably the Beatles best album. Really a must have in any music collection. Two of George Harrison's best Beatles songs. Also, the most recognized drum riff in classic rock history by Ringo. Then there's John & Paul's great work, I only wish I hadn't already listen to this album a 1000 times already.

1607066017|4.0|Saga, Volume One (2013) collects the first six issues of the Image comic written by Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by Fiona Staples. Here, two lovers whose people are at war attempt to flee the planet with their newborn baby.<br /><br />Saga is an interesting and imaginative blend of science fiction and fantasy that calls to mind both Star Wars and Mass Effect, but which does so without feeling particularly derivative. Vaughan has created a cast of good characters, all with believable motivations. In fact, The Will and Prince Robot IV might be more interesting and more sympathetic than the wishy-washy Marko (although he gets better quickly) and the walking annoying rage tantrum that is Alana. The themes of parenting and family are particularly well done, though, which makes them endearing enough.<br /><br />Saga is consistently explicit, both in terms of violence and sex. At times, this is used to good storytelling effect (e.g., Prince Robot IV and his wife in issue #1), but more often, it's just gratuitous. In combination with some of the dialogue, Saga sometimes feels like Vaughan is trying too hard to be edgy, and it works a lot better when he's not.<br /><br />Entirely apart from this issue, Staples' art is quite good. Her characters are realistic, and she uses backgrounds to create a rich world. The highlight, though, is her faces, which are excellent both in their expression and consistency. The only real complaint with the art is that the heavy inks on the characters often make them look like paper cutouts overlaid on the much softer backgrounds.<br /><br />So, while it's got a few issues, Saga is a reasonably compelling story that's rich with potential. I don't know that I'd run out for Volume Two, but I was invested enough to wonder, at least, what happened next.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|AMAZING, I have watched it twice through. Cant get enough of the action and plot changes.<br />Having it on blu ray is a must, Cant beat the price
B008Y212PI|4.0|I found this game to be relaxing yet gives your brain a challenge. Look forward to the other FlipPix games.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This was the best of the Iron Man movies. It was like riding a roller coaster with all of the action. It leaves you wanting more.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this book. The first book was, in my opinion, one of the worst books I have ever read. Yet curiosity pulled me into this book and I am so glad! Not only did Lauren Oliver improve/progress as an author but Lena (the main character) did as well. I was pleasantly surprised and now must read the final novel an the novellas as well! The ending of the story, although easy to sense that it was coming, still surprises and shocks you! This novel was gripping and suspenseful and the characters were easy to love, understand, and relate to! Again, 100 times better than the first novel
B0044XRIMW|5.0|A wonderful classic!  A movie for all ages, with no worries about inappropriate behavior or language being heard by small ears.  They don't make movies like this anymore!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Very frustrating. A good story, but if it was detail overload in the first 60 percent of the book, the ending wouldn't have been so rushed and cliff hanger-y for the final book of a trilogy. There is too much left unsaid, and this is a big issue when reading the final book of a trilogy!<br /><br />Edit: I have slept on it and am even more upset than I was when I first finished the novel. In this book we have implied promise of a revolution. We are left, at the end of the last novel, with the feeling and foreshadowing of a coming revolution. Yet in the book we travel around the wilds for 70% or more of the novel, and hear of the horrible happenings in Portland and to Lena's friends and family. Yet the last 20-30% of the novel is where we read of the revolution taking place and all we get is the beginnings of it. And then it ends and we do not know if anyone survives, if there is a power overthrow or shift, if the crypts are cleared, or what happens to Hana and Fred. It is all very frustrating. Is Lauren Oliver just planning on releasing a new book and making a quartet? Ugh..
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Like his.previous books, Hosseini weaves a beautiful, sad and thought provoking tale. The characters are complex and the story is skillfully woven. Loved it!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I read this in just a few hours! It was NON Stop! Gripping from start to finish. It is impossible for me to give a thorough review without any spoilers but lets just say that it doesn't disappoint.
0800141660|5.0|I rank this in my top ten all-time. The performances, paticularly by Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, are wonderful and should bee seen again and again.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Must read for everyone. It is a well written well rounded book that will make you feel better and more comfortable about rejecting dogma

0736083863|5.0|I bought this book on recommendation from a friend who teaches Pilates.  It is extremely thorough but not pedantic.  I use this book every morning with very little exceptions.<br /><br />I received this item in less than perfect condition.  The package was ripped open and there were tire marks which also covered the stamp so this obviously happened outside of the sellers control.  Nonetheless they gave me the option of replacing it or discounting it.  I chose the discount because I was too excited to wait!  The whole process was friendly and prompt.  I will definitely be using this seller again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Hard to put this one down.  A compelling tale with good pace.  Surprises with the complexity of a jailhouse plan.  Does he pull it off?  Good guy or bad guy?  You can be the judge!
B00EUS6FR0|4.0|This is not the best Pink Martini album to come out, but it is still a welcome addition to the collection.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|With the tedium of character development for the returning characters out of the way, this sequel gets right down to silly business. I liked it a lot, my wife liked it a lot, our grandchildren loved it. It is out of the theaters now and our 2 year old granddaughter still asks to see the \\"minion movie.\\" Our easily frightened six year old was not scared at all... the scary parts are very short and are not menacing. No kids crying in the theater any of the times we went!<br /><br />Obviously the movie does not have the depth of serious movies, but it is a comedy. Laugh and enjoy it or pout alone.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|In my opinion this app is better than its 3 star overall rating as it is easily to use and quick to get tv to what you want. However there are improvement s to be made like the subscription box and channels` recent uploads. But over all it is a good app and much better than going on the web to watch YouTube.

1439153663|5.0|It was a &#34;fast reader&#34;.  I couldn't put it down!  I learned a lot about white slavery<br />during that time of history as well a black slavery.  It was a very emotional<br />book!  I have recommended it to friends who have already purchased and read it.<br />They express the same sentiments as I do.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Our whole family loves this, from Grandma and Grandpa to my 2 and 3 year old boys, and everyone in between.<br /><br />The pictures are beautiful and captivating, and it boasts an educational experience that is thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />I only wish there was a french version included.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Loved that this young man was able to succeed, against all odds.  What a wonderful legacy to have left for his children, friends and family.  Not only was he a hero but his wife was equally heroic in how she supported and stood by him.  Kudos.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Not expecting a lot with a Brad Pitt flick, but was pleasantly surprised.  Lots of action and good story had me on the edge of my seat.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|When I first saw \\"A Quest of Heroes\\" pop up on Amazon's suggested reading I was excited to finally sink my teeth into a new series.  However, that's where the excitement ended.  After the first chapter I was annoyed with the simplistic writing style, shallow characters, and complete lack of depth in the writing.  The development of the main character, Thor, is laughable.  By the end, as one of the other reviewers stated, I was against the main character because he was whiny and annoying.  In fairness, I wasn't happy with myself either for actually finishing this book rather than stopping after that first chapter (I hoped it would get better...it didn't).  In the end, the writing is elementary grade school level and the subjects are not quite fit for kids that age (brothels, some cursing), so I can't even recommend this book for kids.  Terrible.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved it! It was amazing and very entertaining!! The action in this book was awesome and I love the romance in the book
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|The acting was excellent and the music was awesome. It was truly entertaining. Having read the book, it's fun to see this director's rendition of the story - it was accurate, but had the director's touch.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Game worth $5. By the way if if stuck look up strategy so you can beat the level. It is not really cheating because online walk throughs will only let you beat the Level. When I started I was clue less, and they will get you stated( and unlock worm and zombie) but to get a good score ( without being a hacker) like 2million plus you need your own way. After using guides I learned enough to get that on my own. Ps how many people have this game for kindle?
B0064MPXFA|5.0|As someone who works closely with elected officials and lawyers, I loved this show! Could not stop watching once I started.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Morgan rice did a good job and held my interest, simple but enjoyble. Compared to Terry Brooks I would recommend this series so far I havent been able to put it down. Brooks writes with more depth but Rice is rigt behind him. Also with JJ Tolkens Lord of the Rings and even Harry Potters series
B00296A4F4|4.0|I love all the music numbers....some especially.  I decided to watch from the beginning over since I caught only a show here and there each season.  Anyone who likes music, I think, would like these performances within the story of all the characters.  Put a Ring on It, No Air are special standouts through season 1 through #7 show.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is a wonderful way to search anything I am looking for.  It gives me several options to choose from to narrow down my search on a specific topic. I like it because it is quick & easy to use.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Love, Love, Love it.  Beautifully filmed in Iceland (tho bleak), Ireland and Croatia, costumes fantastic and takes you to a different fantasy world.  A bit difficult to pick up on all the talking and characters, cause the names are so foreign, but there is never a loss for excitement, albeit very brutal at times and very sexual.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Love the having no commercials! When I have nothing better to do this is great to kick back and relax with.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Watched twice....great suspense and mystery attempting to figure out what he is figuring out.  I understand the book may depict a bigger, tougher guy, but Cruise does the role well.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Just about every issue that could come up regarding pregnancy is covered. Several different stories are played, some funnier than others. My favorite one was the one with Cameran Diaz. She is a pregnant physical fitness guru. It is so funny.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Hooked after the first show.  This series is very brutal and sexual, yet extremely well done fantasy of the seven make-believe kingdoms in battle for the almighty throne.  We watched sometimes 3-4 programs in one sitting as an enjoyable escape from reality.  Beautifully filmed and characters to sink your teeth in.
1607066017|5.0|In a distant place where there are multiple warring species, two people fall in love and have a baby.  It's an age old story -- he's a devil man who has sworn off violence, she's a fairy lady just looking for a safe place for their baby.  Also, ghosts and rocket trees.  That's right, rocket trees.  Weird and wonderful.
B0096HL33G|2.0|We started watching it and it was so slow and depressing and our company and us decided to stop watching after about 30 minutes.  A disappointing pick unless it got much better later!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Love love love this old favorite.....<br />Would highly recommend for anyone who grew up with the amazing Carole King :)
B0089LOG02|5.0|This tale of unspeakable hardships thrust upon already burdened children, some too young to understand, will make your heart ache.  Then, as they grow and learn how to thrive in spite of the challenges they faced, you get a sense of hope above fear and a grace above the sadness they once knew. Well worth the reading.

B005C0DHEY|5.0|Shocking. Revelatory. This movie should be viewed by all Americans so they can see exactly what is going on in areas affected by fracking.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|At times, it's brilliantly cheesy and ridiculous, but strangely believable. But, truly, I do LOVE this show and if Star Trek fans are called &#34;Trekkies&#34; then count me a &#34;Gater!&#34;

B006CHML4I|4.0|The watch actually looks better than the photo posted on line!<br /><br />Have been using it for a few weeks.  Like the design and lightness of this watch.<br /><br />Another feature I like is that I don't need to change batteries as long as I wear the watch regularly.<br /><br />Although the canvas strap seems flimsy, it works quite well so far, making the watch very light.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Great book.I loved it.  America seems to be based off of USA s attitude today. She is an amazing. Wonderful
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great read, full of nostalgia. I read the shining recently for the first time so it was all fresh in my head, this picks up as close to where it left off as it could. I only wish there were more.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun, good interface, LOTS of levels.<br /><br />Slightly addicting puzzle game with a concept similar to minesweeper, where numbers help you identify which tiles are hit and which are miss. However, its mechanics differ by placing the number clues around the board instead of inside it,  providing tile counts of columns and rows.<br /><br />Although this game got pretty easy once I figured out quick ways to identify tiles, I still have the desire to beat every level. 5x5 boards are way too easy - I skipped all of them. 10x10 is the ideal board size, as 15x15 is way too big for a cell phone and requires page scrolling. 15x15 takes longer to complete but that doesn't necessarily mean it's more difficult.<br /><br />I recommend this app.
B00EVN3JNM|5.0|i didnt know what to expect when i bought this movie. it turns out, this is one of my favorite movies and i &#34;high&#34;ly recommend it to anyone who likes movies about bank robberies and magic!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book. I didn't think I would. Especially as locked away and permanent as little Danny Torrance seemed in my head for all these years. It was painful to witness, via King 's colorful prose, Danny's sickening bottom as a young adult. But much like the Generation X Danny and I belong to...life doesn't stop at your biggest mistake. He grew into a fine, useful man...one who'd been knocked around by life and his own bad choices but felt obligated to the people who had been good to him, to be better. Not as terrifying as The Shining but oddly more satisfying. I came away feeling grateful that the kid was all right. Thanks as always Stephen King.
B005HSGB6W|4.0|I read this a number of years ago, enticed by the music from the movie.  I enjoyed the story then as I did recently when I re-read it.  As in my previous reading of this Burgess novel, my mailn interest was focused on the author's use of a Russian slang for the main character.  I have, as yet, not found anybody who read this book who did not understand Russian.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Adam shatters conventional wisdom about personal success and impact over time which should help us all enjoy the benefits of trust, cooperation and collaboration. Too bad conventional wisdom gets all the press...
B009S33I68|4.0|I read this book because it was highly recommended by people whose opinions I trust.  They were misguided.  The action and general story line were great.  It seemed as tho' the authors relied on mentioning a name to ensure the sale of the book to that person.  Disappointing!

1476727651|4.0|*** spoilers! ***<br />Dan Torrance grew up to be an alcoholic, just like his father. But now he's in recovery and working in a hospice where he uses his Shine to comfort people when they die. But what is his connection to a young girl named Abra Stone? And what does The True Knot, a traveling group of RV people, want with her?<br /><br />After all the glimpses shown in NOS4A2, I knew I'd be reading this one hot off the presses. Was I disappointed? Well, I don't think it was a home run.<br /><br />I loved the story of Dan Torrance, recovering from his experience at the Overlook with his parents in<br />The Shining, only to become an alcoholic just like his old man. His road to recovery was well done and I loved how the connection to Abra Stone unfolded. Dan's friends were well done and I found myself dreading which one of them would die at the bloody conclusion, as is the fate of many Stephen King supporting cast members.<br /><br />There were some nice Easter eggs in Doctor Sleep. Charles Manx, Castle Rock, the Dark Tower, and probably a few others I've already forgotten. When Dan got a job at TeenyTown, I had flashbacks of Joyland. Maybe Joyland started life as a fragment of Doctor Sleep that got cut out like a bad appendix. Also, I have a feeling Stephen King read a book about carnies and felt the need to work as much lingo into his work as possible.<br /><br />Another thing I loved was the True Knot. I love the idea of a bunch of psychic vampires riding around in RVs, draining kids of their Shine to rejuvenate them. Rosie the Hat was pretty vile and her compatriots were almost as bad. I almost feared for Abra Stone's life.<br /><br />Almost. My main problem with the book is that Abra was too powerful and I never thought for a moment that she wouldn't survive. When she outmaneuvers the bad guys at every turn, there's no sense of jeopardy. The ending was straight from the Nerf factory. I don't remember another Stephen King book where so many of the good guys survived the final encounter.<br /><br />Still, it was a fun read and there were some tense moments. We'll call it a 3.5.ved the final encounter.<br /><br />Still, it was a fun read and there were some tense moments. We'll call it a 3.5.

B007HUD6OS|5.0|This was a great read, and I would suggest this to any of my friends. Theo`s quirky personality and calculating ways blending with realistic events make for a great read. Another success by John Grisham.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I was hooked from the first moments. The series is well-written and the characters are believable. It is like a little slice of life during a time when the social order of hundreds of years was on the brink of major change. The industrial age was about to come to a small village. Class distinctions and divisions were slowly eroding, and the worker would rise in prominence and the farmers would slowly see their lives changed. The series explores many of the issues and joys of this social and political change. Many things that were viewed in only black and white, were soon seen to have many shades of grey. For some, flexibility became necessary; for some the changes were frightening and they would take a stand to remain the same.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|The ultimate success of this genre depends on the viewers \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\"  Very hard to do when:<br /><br />1. Zombies take over the world at light speed.  The entire city of NY NY falls in about a half hour, yet Brad Pitt and his family manage to escape.<br />2. A former \\"UN Envoy\\" (Brad Pitt) is portrayed as a James Bond like character that the US military, the Israeli government, and the CIA come to for answers.  Not the UN from real life.<br />3. Israel is able to keep the zombies out by building a 40ft-plus ft high wall around their entire country.  Then the zombies climb up on each other to form a human mountain of undead flesh and scale the wall.<br />4. Pitt's wife call him on an iridium phone while he is in South Korea investigating the source of the zombie outbreak, and while he is surrounded by zombies just waiting to take him down. The call is so he can say goodnight to his kids. Pitt narrowly escapes, several of his comrades are bitten and become zombies all thanks to his wife's naivety...  and Pitt doesn't even bother to tell his wife not to call him again, while he is involved in operations.<br /><br />I could go on and on. If you want pulp action and are a fan of zombie movies then by all means watch this.  Don't expect to laugh, cry, or feel like you are there, however.<br /><br />As someone who both loves action sci-fi, but also realizes a well done movie may be done by artistically representing something like an old man fishing from a boat and nothing more (as in Hemmingway's \\"Old Man and the Sea), I have to say this movie is not well done on either end of the spectrum.  I stopped watching it after 45 minutes--something I only do about once every 5 years or so.

The lead singer, Hayley Williams, is a gifted singer that pours everything she has into ever track on the disc. I am glad that Paramore is getting some much deserved air time on a national level and will be buying more of their  music in the near future.
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, great soundtrack. Joe Pesci really gives a memorable performance. Have watched it several times over the years.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Really loved this movie. I have watched it several times. I love a movie that gives you hope. And without all the sex and gore. There are some scenes that I would not recommend for young children, as there is violence . I love having a female heroine. I read the book and it is very close to the book I was not disappointed. I can see this happening in our near future....
B002361MLA|4.0|Having finally read it, I can certainly understand why so many people are drawn to this book. Eckhart draws from the ages of perennial philosophy and articulates it with incredible fluidity and simplicity. He also draws from the great teachings of various major religions and applies them in largely unfamiliar, 'esoteric' ways. He doesn't personally ascribe to any particular religion in this book but it's clear that his background is Christian. The entire goal of the book can be summarized, very simply, by focusing one's attention in the 'present moment'. Being a Christian myself, I found the book intriguing, but couldn't help but have a sense of disappointment in the very nebulous description of God. God seems to have no personality but was more the 'universal intelligence'. Eckhart is understandably cautious about how he uses the word 'God'. However, to me God seems to be so much more than just an intelligence. I personally perceive God, as do many Christians as an extremely caring and loving being. One who has a personality of his own. A compassionate nurturer who empathizes with the suffering of people. This book paints an 'intelligence' of indifference whereas according to the New Testament - God is Love. I realize that this critique is biased, based upon my own experience. I gave the book 4 stars for the  incredibly articulate manner in which it was written. However for me, it falls short of seeing the beautiful person who is at the center of it all, that is, God.

There are quite a few gems on this album and the remix brings a greater separation between Alex's guitar & Ged's bass. The original mix of guitar & bass sounded loud & muddled - Not at all like a RUSH recording. I'm digging it! ENJOY

B00ARA4SLU|3.0|Just some quick observations: Hitch was not only an iconic director but also an iconic personality, with his profile and jocularly morbid observations almost as famous as his films; While we see quite a bit of Mr. and Mrs. Hitch, where is their daughter, Patricia? She was IN Psycho and where is Saul Bass?; What were the changes in the Alma and Hitch re-cut Psycho? It had to be more than the Herrmann score; This film never quite gets the period as believably as say Hollywoodland. Hopkins had an insurmountable task in portraying Hitchcock. While some scenes and angles produced mildly convincing potrayals the vast majority of scenes had Hitch looking lifeless, stiff and hopelessly over-applied. All said and done not an unenjoyable 100 minutes for fans... Johansson does an admirable job of nailing Leigh though...

0060245867|5.0|We had this book when our children were young. Now we are purchasing it for several friends and relatives who have small children. This book, and the other &#34;If You Give...&#34; books by Laura Numeroff are wonderful!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|The magic was entertaining and slick, but the plot was lacking. I would recommend it if you love magic tricks and how they are done.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|All too often contemporary professional women with families are essentialized as giving career or family too much priority at the expense of the other. For many of us the reality is family (at least our children) first, unrelieved stress due to knowing it is impossible to do all we want for both family and career, and a beloved husband who talks the talk of supporting women but does not walk the walk of doing so. Alicia is more glamorous than we are, but we identify totally with her complex dilemma.
B00DYFCYSO|2.0|I guess its growing on me but I should have just bought the single of the one song that sounds like John Legend
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I love this movie, but I think it would have been nice to add bloopers in the extras. The only extras are how it was made.
B000F6IOC0|1.0|Typical fare of gore and more gore that today's horror film makers have succumbed to. Try watching any of the gothic Hammer films of the 60s instead, when casting and suspenseful plots were the norm.
B005544TRQ|4.0|A little depressing, but fascinating. Winning a case against your opponent only matters... there is no such thing as truth, ethics, or morals for these guys. And these are the guys that have applied this mentality to our politics as well, and even run our country.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is one of the very best games, I've ever played ! Totally addictive, I hope they make more like it. Well worth the price. !!!
B00004RF98|5.0|Also bought this for my daughter to watch. Very inspiring for dancers to see especially if they are going to do musical theatre!
B00DW39B2K|1.0|John Travolta actually repellant. Gruesome and unnecessary violence. Perfect film for a sadist. Poor Robert DeNero, well not so poor. Another film made for money, I'd guess.
B00F91H15W|2.0|I found this movie to really slow at times. Its not one of my favorites. It was more frustrating than entertaining.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would enjoy this movie or not when we made the rental purchase, but can honestly say that it was a great movie that I would watch again!
B008Y768XO|4.0|I watched this movie because its storyline was from a true experience. The movie was slow moving, although I enjoyed it. Towards the end I was crying to think of the devotion of Hachi. I enjoyed Richard Gere's performance.
0385523394|1.0|This book offers yet another example of how a privileged, well-educated, middle-class white person seizes an opportunity to exploit people of color in order to make a quick buck.<br /><br />This self-righteous brat drones on and on about how smart and well-read she is compared to her inmates. If you are really that smart, then how come you were dumb enough to get involved in a major drug trafficking scheme when you had a college degree and enough imagination to land you any opportunity that your privileged heart desired.<br /><br />Why weren't there more stories about the women who found themselves in FCI Danbury due to a racist legal justice system, and the unequal opportunities that are available to them in society? She only alluded to these injustices.<br /><br />To top it off, she sells her story to Netflix in order to create a comedic series about her short stint behind bars, only furthering to exploit the (fake) relationships that she formed, and making a joke out of an extremely corrupt prison system that needs to be remedied.<br /><br />One word: sellout.
B00A287PG2|3.0|No surprises here but a good overview of the history or the company, the growth of the consulting industry and the myth of McKinsey.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who wants to build up their endurance and lose weight. I would start with level one. I am a beginner, but I've heard even people who are fairly in shape start with level one as well. I've done this for seven days and I can start to tell a difference in my strength and energy level. Get this now!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Loved the show. Great plots and super writing. Can't wait to see all episodes. I'm glad to see the show is still on.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|I LIKE IT. bUT IT IS AN OLD FILM. I HAVE SEEN BEFORE. IT IS GOOD. I SAW IT WITH MY DAUGHTER THIS TIME.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|A great story with real characters--fun to get to know, and you care how it turns out for them.  The twins go off to college--and all the challenges that brings---I think a teen would love this book--but it is fun for me with young adult offspring off to college---really top notch writing and a great story.
0553240749|5.0|IT IS GOOD. NEARLY BRAND NEW. MY AUGHTER IS READING IT EVERYDAY THIS WEEK FOR HER LITERATURE CLASS. IT IS GOOD FOR STUDENTS.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|What I like best about this movie as well as the last Star Trek movie, is you don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy them.  The action packed movie is far beyond that of the &#34;trekie&#34; people have known to stereo type.  Awesome movie.!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was an excellent book. This is the first time I have read a book from this author and was very impressed and certainly will read another of his books
B00A83075M|5.0|The kids love this movie. I must admit that I watch it with the kids and so do their parents
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|It was different that I thought it would be but it is fun and challenging.  I enjoy playing it when I have some downtime.
0062012339|5.0|A great read for anyone who loves rock memoirs. It's offensive, shocking, and just simply amazing. Prepare for a crazy journey because you will not be able to put this book down!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love this book. I couldn't put it down.  Its worth th read if you are into fantasy type books.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I have read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books and his entire archive of New Yorker articles so it's safe to call me a fan of his writing style.  David and Goliath was consistently interesting, and an easy read, but the premise of the book and the supporting anecdotes were weaker than some of his previous novels.  Several of the stories did little to prove his thesis, including the chapter on little fish in pig ponds, or the chapter on the civil rights movement.  I think fans of Gladwell will enjoy this book, but those who are new to Gladwell and looking for the best example of his writing would probably be better off with Outliers, my personal favorite.

B00007LTIA|5.0|I think it is the Magnum Opus of a great band.  I have seldom been so affected by a recording, including other Yes albums.  This one just hits hard and mixes beauty and cacaphony in a truly engaging way.  I listen to it frequently and always hear something new.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Producers of this movie chose quality actors.  Frodo is charming and the rest of the cast interesting.  I can't wait to view part II of this movie series.  BTW:  Recommend you read the book.  There is a depth and scope to the book that Hollywood just can't seem to capture when producing movies based on classic novels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the book, I am actually disappointed with how much is not in the movie. But still I loved the book a whole lot more then the movie. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00881VLCE|4.0|great little game  love playing this as there are several levels. would like to see more of these puzzles with more scenery or popstars instead of animals and Christmas.

B0096DFBZQ|4.0|The grands love it! Not for me, I can't seem to stay in my lane (LOL) it keeps them entertained.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This was an excellent book! It validates this introverts' need for inner recognition that we don't all have to be loud and gregarious in our everyday lives to get by. It also explains how an introvert can become an extrovert when he/she is wrapped in the midst of something they truly believe in, if necessary.  This was a feel-good book for me.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very entertaining, always full of surprises, amazing characters. I was looking for something engaging and different from all the television shows I've been watching. So far, this show game me something to look forward to.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|So much emotion in this book . The reader can taste the dust, feel the pain, of Himmel Street.  Recommended.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I find this game to be challenging but not too hard. It is a little wordy but at least the storyline makes it worth it. You have to really think about what you want to accomplish with the tools they give you.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations. Required reading for dog lovers. Every dog should come with a copy of this book.
B0000714BP|5.0|I love this movie and it can in on time brand new... buy this product you will not regard it
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Love it! I have a 3yr old and a five yr old. They love this movie. Better than most of these kids movies that come out.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I am a big Charlton Heston fan and have seen 99% of his movies.  This is one of my favorites.  I also like it, because of it's historical background about the true &#34;Cid&#34;.  This along with &#34;KHARTOUM&#34; are just great historical epic films with one of the world's greatest actors to have graced us with his talent!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a well-written story that kept my interest from beginning to end.  The characters are interesting and believable.  I give it thumbs up.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|Fun-but below Leo's gripping ability. Will have to watch again for better judgment of sound and visual details.<br />May be over rated.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is such a fun game that is great for people of all ages. Coming from somepony without a credit card however, the game is difficult. There are a lot of things you can only get with gems, which are semi-rare unless you buy them. But with that a side, the game is awesome.
B00EC6VA98|5.0|Sophomore albums can make or break an artist; with her second album Obel dazzles the listener with a style and an artistic vision that show confidence and mastery. I pre-ordered the album based on the strength of Philharmonics and was not disappointed, not one track feels out of place or takes a miss-step. Spare, impressionistic, beautiful arrangements of lyrics that, while sung in perfect English, add more of an instrumental quality to the music than meaning. Five stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought it was going to be an easy kid game that I would check it out. I loved the movie so what the heck. I thought I would delete it soon after. NOT!! I am addicted. At 42 years of age. SURPRISE. AWSOME GSME.
B0083Z614S|5.0|very good book recommended for ages nine through eighty one of the best books I have ever read great book.
B000FC130E|2.0|I adored AMERICAN GODS and ANANCI BOYS but I could never get into this fantasy tale.  Save your money for something else.
B00EFNXPFK|3.0|The only other album I had was the 2008 live show, so I really had no idea what to expect.  I like parts of it, but just a tad too twangy for me.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is a great story.  It is told from a very interesting perspective.  It is very thought provoking, would be good for a book club book!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|He is a spectacular writer.  Always excited about his books and when they are over, very sad cause I want more.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Another fun game from Rovio. Keeps me entertained for hours. It's filled with little surprises like trading characters. I like this one better than the original Star Wars.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|I guess I am easily entertained. I enjoyed the action. This is typical Bruce Willis. Lots of action with a little plot.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was really opposed to buying this, because I am leary of anything that has the brand name Google (this company has too much power, like reading your gmail emails) but my husband wanted to try it, If you stream from your tablet to your TV the images are dark like it is always night time when the shows are being taped or something. We tried to play around with the settings but the wireless capability is not as optimal as you want it. But if you just want the convenience they go ahead and try it. Personally, I think it does not matter to me if I stream from a tablet because we have an Xbox and the Xbox gives a clear picture when streaming.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is he was a great game you should play because my mom  told me to get good games so. Get it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is an awesome alarm!  i use it instead of my old clock radio alarms...who needs a clock anymore?!  i love the snooze feature too!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Certainly not as good as the previous novel! - this one let him down - not as absorbing a read
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|DT fan since 1991, I pretty much love everything that DT has done.  There are albums I like more than others, and my favorite albums are I&W, SFAM, and ADTOE.  I like both Portnoy and Mangini.  I loved the music on their last album (but not the lyrics so much), and listening to `backs of angels', `lost not forgotten', `bridges in the sky', `outcry' and `breaking all illusions\\" just blow me away each time and are just DT perfection in my mind.<br /><br />Getting that out of the way, I'm struggling with this album a bit.  In a specific moment, it's great, quintessential DT music.  But stepping back, many of the songs on this album are made of awesome riffs that don't fit together or transition well for me.  Enemy Inside is the only song that doesn't suffer from that problem, and I think is one of the strongest songs on the album.  On the other end of the spectrum, Illumination Theory has too many `whiplash' moments - the sections of the songs are beautiful, but the flow and connection between them are not there. For me these songs just don't compare with `bridges' or `outcry'; they just don't pack the same punch.  Finally, I thought the solos/jamming/progressive interludes were slightly below DT standards; was hoping for more insane jams like on 'lost not forgotten' and 'outcry'.  Regardless of the mix (I like the bass mix on ADTOE slightly more than this album) or musicianship (awesome as always), to me DT's songwriting is key, whether ballad or heavy metal epic.<br /><br />I feel like I've just sat down with a 10,000 piece puzzle, and while each piece is stunning, I'm having trouble putting it together into the masterpiece that I expect.  Not that I'm going to give up, as with each listen it's getting better.  While I dont think this album is as strong as ADTOE, its still a 4-star album, and looking forward to many more.

0375413405|5.0|This cookbook should have been a first cookbook purchase for me, but I really didn't get into cooking until about a year ago and have been relying on the internet and what's laying around the house. I'm late 40s - it's never too late to learn. It's my night time reading right now just so I can get to know what's in there. Love the presentation of the basics along the way - everything from what types of knives and cookware to have to the various types of chicken and what to do with them etc...I have barely scratched the surface, but it is totally worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it. It is so addictive to play plus its free! Get it!<br />I love how it lets you get so many bananas unlike some games where you have to buy things like that.
B00CM9JL4S|5.0|Another great album from Orphaned Land.  By the third time through I was hooked and I played it continuously in my car for about 3 weeks.  It doesn't matter that not all of the songs are in English when the writing is this good.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Like like this game .it have a lot of adventure.and ever end .............anybody can play this game .so much fun .
B000GWE44U|5.0|Although I find the movie a bit too long, it always scares me.  Even when I try to imagine the boy's scenes as just a movie, it still gets to me.  This movie is on my top 10 list.

B005K17RU0|4.0|I've had this awhile now and I only have one problem with it. I love that I can add many different cities all over the US and the world. I like to keep track of the weather where my family and friends live. The problem is that I want to delete one of them and I can't find out how to do it. I would really appreciate it if anyone could tell me what to do. It's not an end of the world thing- just a bit annoying.<br />I would definitely recommend it to others.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Renters don't even bother. it lack so many things includes a story line and good acting.I want my money back
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show, love it.  Friends suggested I watch it.  I figured I had plenty of time to watch all 3 seasons before January's new season.  Couldn't stop watching it and finished all 3 seasons.  Now the wait for January to see what happens next!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just sit back and find a way out. Don't give up. You never know where the next puzzle piece may be hiding. Fun way to spend a little down time. Try it. Nothing to lose.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I've been with this series from the start. They are amazing actors and the story lines keep me on the edge of my seat as well as laughing over their funny antics. Highly recommended!
B003UYUP58|5.0|A vibrant walk through much of the history of not only cancer but medicine. The book provides a window into the illness experience and the way to mitigate illness

B000058USU|4.0|I only recently became aware of the exalted reputation of this 1966 recording. Some reviewer somewhere said it was the only Missa Solemnis you need. If only I'd known that before I bought the other five! For many years I owned only Bernstein(1979), Karajan(1975) and Shaw(1987), with Bernstein clearly the best. Later I acquired Gardiner's super-fast and rather superficial period instrument version and most recently Ormandy's underrated 1967 recording, remarkable for the crystalline clarity of the choral singing and which I've also reviewed.<br /><br />After listening to the Klemperer once I decided for the purpose of reviewing it to do a movement by movement comparison with the Bernstein, which I hadn't heard in some time and which is also highly regarded. As is well known, the sound engineering on the Klemperer is exceptional. That said, like most recordings I've heard it fails to achieve an ideal clarity in the most texturally complex sections of the Gloria and Credo. [Note: I heard this on a copy of the original 1988 recording not the 2001 \\"remastering.\\" Another customer review, filed under the 2001 release, suggested there is little difference.] Bernstein's was a live performance although you can't really tell - there's no audience noise and while the sonics are good, it's not nearly as good as the Klemperer. I also had the feeling that it took a little time for the performance to warm up.<br /><br />They say the most important thing is to make a good first impression and Klemperer certainly does that - his Kyrie is as perfect as any performance can be. It's expressively sung by both chorus and solists and crisply executed - every rhythmic attack, every dynamic change seems exactly right and as Beethoven wrote it. Bernstein's isn't bad but doesn't have that same crisp execution. Also soprano Edda Moser and alto Hanna Schwarz sound a bit strained. They get better later.<br /><br />After that great beginning Klemperer's Gloria is a letdown. It's a real bear of a movement, with its thick textures and sharp transitions, the most difficult in the work. His opening tempo is somewhat slow for my taste, and it does matter here, making it more difficult to maintain cohesion through the sudden rapid changes in tempo and dynamics. The execution seems less sharp than in the Kyrie. The final fugue is EXTREMELY slow, much more so than in any other version I know and I see no payoff from it - it's no clearer than in most recordings. I was hoping at first that he was merely holding something in reserve for Beethoven's two tempo increases in the coda, but he only gets a little faster. If Bernstein doesn't solve all the problems of this movement, at least he's a lot more exciting. There's a crispness of execution that was missing from his Kyrie. Score tied at one all.<br /><br />The Credo is a return to form for Klemp. That sharpness of execution is back. The Et resurrexit section is a little on the slow side but not so as to matter too much. The first part of the Et vitam fugue is sung very quietly, almost in a whisper. The vocal lines are nicely defined. But when the fugue speeds up he really is too slow - still it's not as harmful as the slow tempi in the Gloria. On the whole his Credo is quite good.<br /><br />But Bernstein also raises his game here - and so do his soloists! The first part is excellent, although here the A-B comparison made me appreciate again the superiority of Klemp's sonics. Bernstein's Crucifixus is very powerful. When we get to the Resurrexit his - shall I say normal? - tempo makes it so much more exciting than Klemp's. Oh, those rapid 8th note figurations in the strings! I took quite a vulgar pleasure from it. And now Bernstein begins to leave poor Klemp in the dust. The recapitulation of the Credo theme is much more dramatic and thrilling. The first part of the Et vitam fugue is taken at the same tempo as Klemp's but not quite as quietly and with a more urgent expressivity and yet he still has plenty of room for apowerful crescendo before the coda. Then in the part where Beethoven increases the tempo and the fugue subjects are sung in diminution (twice as fast) Bernstein really does speed up and it's tremendously exciting and once again I took a shameless toe tapping pleasure in it. The slow ending is heavenly, the women's voices fully warmed up now as their scales rise to heaven. Altogether a towering performance.<br /><br />Turning to the Sanctus, the opening Sanctus plus Osanna is very similar in both recordings, though Klemp again benefits from better sonics. Bernstein takes the Praeludium (the orchestral introduction to the Benedictus) much slower than Klemp and the effect is awe inspiring. If you think of the Missa Solemnis as a five movement choral symphony then the Sanctus is the slow movement, of which the heart is the Benedictus. It's one of Beethoven's great slow movements, with that almost mystical quality of the great slow movements of his late sonatas and quartets. That feeling is missing from Klemperer's approach which has an almost operatic quality. There's little difference in tempo between the two, Bernstein being perhaps a trifle slower. Bernstein here is simply transcendent.<br /><br />Both Agnus Dei's are excellent. There's little to choose from in terms of execution and even interpretively they're practically identical.<br /><br />To sum up, this is a good performance with a superb Kyrie and an excellent Agnus Dei, marred by excessively slow tempi in parts of the Gloria and Credo. To others these may represent valid interpretive choices. That's what makes a horse race.

B000QFW7UA|5.0|The Goonies Bowling for Movies Score: 300 of 300!!  Wahoo - a perfect score :]  Good stuff for sure - at the time of this review only a small handful of movies can boast they got a perfect Bowling for Movies Score - The Big Lebowski, Popeye, and A Clockwork Orange.  A prestigious honor (if I do say so myself) and an incredibly small list considering the hundreds of movies I've seen.<br /><br />But wait - what is this whole Bowling For Movies score anyway (you may very well be asking yourself)?  Well, let me tell you ladies and jellyspoons, I watch movies - LOTS and LOTS of movies.  In a typical week I can watch a dozen or more movies.  I own hundreds of movies - some are 3D, some Blu Rays, many DVDs, heck - I even own a few streaming on Amazon.  It occurred to me that my great love of movies (and collecting) has resulted in a unique problem - I had no way of knowing which were my favorites and then a brain-flower was born which blossomed into Bowling for Movies - just an average dude's way of ranking movies using a scoring system which literally has NOTHING to do with bowling!  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea.  I know what you're likely thinking - what a great use of quasi/pseudo-science!  And I'd agree :]<br /><br />Ok, Movie Dude - if its so great what's it about??<br />Set in and about the Oregonian coastal town of Astoria, a group of pre-teen rejects (The Goonies) set out on the adventure of a lifetime to find the fabled treasure of the dread pirate One-Eyed Willie in order to save their homes which are slated for repossession and destruction to make way for a golf course.  Lead by the iron-willed asthmatic Mickey Walsh (a young Sean Astin) and armed with a treasure map the band of misfit friends brave subterranean labyrinths, dangerous booby traps, and hardcore, despicable criminals in their bid for all that shiny swag.<br /><br />Wonderfully shot, creatively crafted - The Goonies is a true gem of an 80's movie.  To top the entire movie experience off the flick features a top notch soundtrack with some of the decade's most memorable artists such as Cyndi Lauper, REO Speedwagon,  and The Bangles.  This movie was more than Goon-enough for me when I was 14 and now that I'm 42 it's even better as I share the Goonies experience with my little Goonies (Little Miss Movie Dude).<br /><br />What went right:<br />&lt; > Um, like everything - great story, great cinematography, great jokes, great adventure... what can I tell you - it's just a wonderful time.<br /><br />What went wrong:<br />&lt; > Um, like nothing - great movie for kids, teens, or simply the young at heart.<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

B00E0SX118|5.0|Love this movie plus the kids can watch it when we r out. Only thing that I dont like is having the WiFi.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had the good wife marathons and was captivated for hours! This show is addictive and holds your attention and that is not easy for me! Love all the actors making guest appearances and the story lines are great! This is my favorite show for this season and I now have my husband watching also! It is not a surprise this show is in its fifth season...and still going strong! Love this show!!!!!
0800141660|5.0|Hugh Grant made this character come alive.  He's the only one, thus far, that portrayed his character as I imagined him to be.  All the cast were beautifully cast.
B00884GR0W|3.0|The good things about it and the bad things about it are both &#34;it's not Minecraft.&#34; There are many more options for developing your character using levels, but it's much messier to play and the interface is less friendly (this is a failing of no keyboard, not of the game itself... they did well with the inherent limitations of touch-screen interaction).
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Great movie!  After seeing the previews I felt let down that this was going to be a comedy, but I knew that I wanted to see the movie anyway.  It of course had many changes to the original story, but this was to be expected and actually made the movie more enjoyable for me as it offered up new surprises.  Nay sayers remember, we fans are used to the story diverting from alternate dimensions and time lines.  Also the '90s reboot and the original movie had alternate story lines as well.  If you are fan, I feel you should give this movie a chance.  It will also help if you are a fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton as well - I am.  Danny Elfman does a great job with the music.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Frame for frame, this is arguably the best comic to film adaptation out there. It's a film that marries fantastic acting with first rate effects and a story that stands on its own without compromising itself by straying from the source material.<br /><br />Urban and Thirlby are electric on screen, perfectly cast and given great dialogue to work with. And while Urban's effort can't be praised enough, Lena Headley nearly steals the show as the sadistic drug kingpin Ma-Ma.<br /><br />If you want plenty of non-stop visceral action, a great story and great acting, then look no further. After you see it for the first time, you'll be begging for a sequel!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was the first problem I have had this part fixed the problem and is working great thank you for your support
B008Y212PI|5.0|This app has taken me hostage and is still holding on strong! It has a great tutorial that I watched after playing it for hours, it was fun to figure it out the hard way. I recommend trying to do it that way. This app just doesn't get old. HAVE FUN :-)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app has officially replaced my alarm clock! It has all the features that I would want a good clock to, and the music for alarm feature is awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|They are 4 & 7 and are giggling the whole time they are playing. They have asked for help to get through some parts.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|LOVED IT, LOVED IT was everything that I expected.  would recommend it to everyone to see. Hoping there will be another one soon
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Hard to stop watching.  The continued slide of Walt into more and more extreme behavior makes one wonder how far he will go.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I found Hosseini's third book his best so far.  HIghly recommended even if you haven't read the previous ones.  It seems that Hosseini has matured in style, the plot is well constructed and I was totally engrossed from beginning to end.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Love this series.  Enjoy all the actors and the great story lines.  Now we can watch them over and over.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Especially when using the new Nickel batteries, the recharge on this particula flash is extraordinary. I would highly recommend it to any photographer.
B000V6583C|5.0|I may not love what happened to Axl and the boys, but this is one of the best albums made.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|I tried and tried and never could get it to install, so I don't know if it works.  Sorry but if it don't work, no stars..
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It's still a lot of fun but I like the original Angry Birds the best. It's somewhat harder too. Recommend buying!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was excellent. They all were. I enjoy  nice little \\"happily ever after\\" trilogy every now and again. I found myself longing to live in their world. Not even for the erotica, but more so for the love and affection they had for one another. Enjoy!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have used the Kindle charging cord you sent me four times to charge my Kindle and so far it has held up fine. It looks identical to the last three that  failed (the small USB fitting failed on the others) but hopefully this one is better quality.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Must have for Bourne fans (with Blu Ray players). Hint : Use Damon to open the box. I actually had to YouTube how to open because I could feel it tearing. Sure enough, there was a video on how to open the box for this specific trilogy haha.. Excellent feeling knowing I wasn't the only one.
B000JMKNJ2|1.0|I got this book for my teenage son due to it's excellent reviews. It is in a genre he enjoys. However I was appalled at the amount to foul language and graphic subject matter already abundant in the first chapter to the point that I wouldn't let him continue reading it. We got it while on a trip but didn't listen to it first out of the books purchased so I didn't realized how bad it was until it was too late to return it. This is the kind of book that makes parents want ratings like they have on movies for books.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It's amazing. I've been hooked and can't put it down. It's not a mindless game, nor a tedious boring puzzle that keeps increasing in difficulty. I love this app!
0810970686|5.0|My kids have read this books many times already and I always hear them laughing and enjoy it!  Most definitely would recommend it.  Fast shipping and great customer service from Amazon.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Simply Great Steven and Kenny and Barry Goldberg how could they go wrong Thanks for the great new CD. Where's the vinyl?
0810979772|5.0|My kids have read this books many times already and I always hear them laughing and enjoy it!  Most definitely would recommend it.  Fast shipping and great customer service from Amazon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|BEST BOOK IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE ALL PF JOHN GREENS BOOKS ARE AN INSIGHT INTO THE TRUTH OF LIFE AND EMBODY THE LIFE OF TEENAGERS
0810994739|5.0|My kids have read this books many times already and I always hear them laughing and enjoy it!  Most definitely would recommend it.  Fast shipping and great customer service from Amazon.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Great!  It was a wonderful series .  I looked forward to each episode. I felt connected to all of the chsracters.
B00340ESIS|4.0|My son, a writer/actor, recommended this book to me, so I bought the Kindle version, and read it in one sitting.  It has changed the way I approach screen writing, and changed the way I watch movies.  The concepts Snyder presents are fresh, and smartly written from the perspective of an industry-insider who intimately knows the nuts and bolts of writing and selling a screenplay.<br /><br />The book is non-stop, hands-on examples of what to do and what not to do.  There's no showbiz fluff here.  Snyder breaks down the mechanics of screenwriting in terms of telling your story in a time-proven method that is getting scripts sold and movies made in Hollywood.  No, it's not a cookie-cutter &#34;add water and stir&#34; approach, nor is it a formulaic approach telling you that you have to have at least one car chase and one love scene to sell your movie.  You have to bring talent to the table.  But once you've brought your talent, Snyder shows you in explicit detail how screenplays are constructed in terms of where in your script to introduce all the characters, on what page the theme of your movie needs to be setup, on what page your character needs to encounter the crisis that spins the movie into the third act toward your ending.  While what I've just written sounds like a connect-the-dots mechanical way of screenwriting--it isn't.  Snyder helps you understand where so many screenplays go wrong in the first ten pages, and why script readers and producers will toss them out of hand without getting to the end of the first act.<br /><br />If you are serious about selling screenplays, you MUST add this book to your library.  Your screenplay writing will go to a whole new level.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love these puzzles! I can play these for hours! The first two levels are fairly easy but still fun to play. The larger puzzles are more challenging and tame a bit more thought to complete. Love em.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am having a hard time with the dialect but feel the story line is boring. I would not recommend it
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|About 10 years ago I randomly picked up &#34;Difficult Conversations&#34; by the Harvard Negotiating team, of which Roger Fisher is a member and it changed my life.  While all of their books focus on essentially the same points, I still get something new and rich out of each book.<br /><br />They constantly remind you to separate the people from the problem.  The examples and situations that they use to illustrate their point are well written and conversational.  The tips are reinforced throughout the book.  It's a great read and genuinely helpful.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|It's not easy for such an accomplished man to confess that he was wrong but it is refreshing.  The Vietnam War was the single factor that shaped my political life and the life of my wife.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|And we've been fighting to pay out ever since. Some levels are easy, some more challenging. It's  fun to play together.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was an easy read novel with lots of information about the lives of slaves in the late 1700's.  The character development was good and the plot was very interesting.  The story was narrated by two women, one black and one white, who were slaves at a farming  estate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app! Works perfectly on my kindle!!! I did not need another excuse to be on Pinterest all the time!
B000I9W08I|4.0|I purchased this video through Amazon Prime, so I have streamed the video countless times and just love it. It's based on an earlier play, but the movie version is almost true to the original script for &#34;Hello, Dolly!&#34;<br /><br />The only reason I'm rating it 4-stars is because of the poor streaming quality that Amazon provides. I have high speed DSL Internet (so it's not like I'm trying to stream this on a 14.4k dial-up connection). I thought this was important to mention because the movie stops, starts, loses its places. etc. quite frequently.  This can be annoying to some, so it may be worth it to just order the DVD based on personal preferences.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the few electronic gadgets that is really useful and  is truly simple to install and set up. It really does what it says. A refreshing change form most new gadget hype
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Once in a while, a book comes along that catches me by surprise. It's one of those \\"I'm-not-really-expecting-anything\\" experiences that literally makes me glad that I'm able to read.<br /><br />\\"The Rosie Project\\" is one of those books.<br /><br />When I started reading this wonderful romantic comedy, I thought that I'd come across a pleasant enough diversion. Imagine my surprise when I discovered myself laughing and actually tearing up in equal measure.<br /><br />At its most basic, \\"The Rosie Project\\" is the tale of Don Tillman, a man who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, and Rosie Jarman, a bartender who is looking to find her biological father. Naturally, there is the requisite \\"Meet Cute\\" thing going on from the beginning - but I can assure you there is nothing pedestrian or mundane about this book.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away anything about this book - other than to tell you that it's a story about connections, and how finding the right person can change someone forever.<br /><br />The author, Graeme Simsion, has done something truly remarkable here - and when I discovered there was a sequel in the works, it lifted my spirits.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough - and I'm looking forward to reading it once again so that I can spend time with two of the most delightful characters in recent memory.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great Product and one of the best movies ever. Avatar is definitely a must see movie for everyone. I watch it often, the special effects are fantistic.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Usually I have to start lowering stars by the time you get to the 3rd in the series but not this time! LOVE IT!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic comedy that everyone should see. I watch this at LEAST twice a year. It's a must see!
B000U6BT40|5.0|This tall tale set in a futuristic world has enough &#34;today&#34; and &#34;future&#34; to be funny and quirky.  I enjoyed the series on TV and was saddened when it was cancelled.<br />Keeping the twists in the timeline straight was a challenge but added to the interest.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Man I just finished reading Ender's Game and I definitely suggest to anyone reading this to read Ender's Game. Cause it's awesome.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|Great company. Fast responsive staff. The pouch is tough enough to protect the phone. It's a tough and at the same time a compact holder.
B00E7SFAAG|1.0|Motorola electrify (1st geration). Crashes after completing both levels I tried before uninstalling. Fun for both levels I played. I like that it wasn't teaching into my wallet like most phone games. Will try on my kindle fire and hope.
B000002O03|5.0|One of the best albums ever made. Unfortunatly they did not send the updated cd I ordered but I gave it away to a friend. Wont do that again but Fly High Freebird!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|great read for fans of the TV series. Might make many rethink our criminal justice system. Compulsively readable. Well written.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Great movie!  I liked this one just as much as the original.  Daniel Craig make a very good James Bond.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Watched all of the series and never missed on of them. I also bought all the series DVD's and have not opened any of them. My daughter will get them when i am gone. But she said she didn 't want to open them either. So now i have to get her a series set to give to her.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Lots of action.  The opening is awesome and leaves you wondering what will happen next.  I was very sad that we lost &#34;M&#34;.
B00CLNZR2A|4.0|This movie really works for some reason.  The plot has its predictable elements and it resembles Good Will Hunting so much that the Matt Damon cameo at the end worked as an inside joke when the movie was in theaters.  Nevertheless the two lead characters have enough depth to make the story believable and the drama compelling.  This is one of those low budget movies with a great script and great acting that makes you wonder why they don't make more like it.  It hasn't lost any impact over time.  Outstanding (not in an over the top way) performances from Sean Connery, Rob Brown, and Anna Paquin who sparkles in a school girl romance subplot.
B00DYCBH4O|4.0|One of Jane Austen's most widely taught novels.  Read it originally in high school but a quick reread and I remember why I liked it to begin with.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really really loved these books ... Very erotic and a great story line that keeps you coming back for more... I wish there were more of these books lol
0060736267|5.0|This takes me back to the way things were a long time ago. It's good to read about the simple, but hard, life in the city of a while ago.
B001MSMULG|4.0|I'm reading my second Silva book now, The Kill Artist was the first, and I find them very detailed in the beginning and a little hard to get into.  I liked The Kill Artist but am struggling with The Confessor.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|It was to small for the price.  My Grandson didn't like it.  We thought it would have been a little larger.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fun show! Lots of legal jargon, plus twists and turns throughout. If you like analytical shows, you'll like this one.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|Adorable main character who we get to see grow and get everything she wants, AND she's in fandom? I remember the feelings of excitement at the Harry Potter midnight releases, so reading about her waiting for the final book in her favorite series was a wonderful reminder of my childhood. Wonderful story about growing up and shamelessly loving the things you love.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, cannot wait for Season 4 to start! Michonne is the best character, hope they keep her!
B0061S073A|2.0|It advertised as working on the Kindle, but is only for Android devices.  The wording needs to be clarified more carefully.
B009CGCQPU|5.0|Love this version of Austen's classic! Being able to watch it on my Kindle Fire In HD... Awesome! Highly recommended!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is fun for ages 9-13 play the game by saving the characters beat levels to unlock fun things like videos
1419835491|5.0|Not only did I receive the complete series promptly but its condition was excellent. As long as one is mindful when removing discs from their pockets so as not to scrape the discs, all is most brilliant.  It did take longer than a week to watch all 45 discs to ascertain their condition.  The content of West Wing is amazing... of course.  No complaints, no concerns, no negative comments.  Only kudos, commendations & gratitude.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game very much. I think I might be addicted to it . You guys should  make a game in a different place like  Russia or France.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game, great graphics.......awesome gameplay...I highly recommend this is you are looking for a shooter game. This is the best so far.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Pretty limited use unless you subscribe to NetFlix, or now Hulu.  Maybe when more sign up to cast it will be better.  I do have to remind myself though that it's only $35!
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I love this CD and love that it was available immediately, even before I received the CD in the mail, to download the songs on to my Cloud Player. I love this feature.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Loved this season of The Good Wife. I really like Calinda (sp?), and she plays a major role this season. I'm not sure that the trials were that exciting but then that really isn't why we watch the show.  The ending, as always, leaves us both wanting to be sure what it means and hoping we misinterpreted the last few seconds.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great books!! Couldn't stop reading!! Makes a woman sit back and yearn and wish she had a Mr. Grey to protect, love,and punish her ;)
B0063M22QO|3.0|I've only had it for a day. Still learning the rules, but good vacation tool. Looking forward to learning and plying more
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the update app and in game messages have a glitsch that needs repaired, but otherwise a fun game! must play
B008B9JTLI|1.0|Content poorly handled. Could have been done much better .Director could have done a better job. Did not flow smoothly
B008FPOIT6|3.0|and a good adventure story. What I enjoyed most were the current world references - technology, graphic design, movie set design - plus the mentions of actually existing companies and brands.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|There finally is another game from Fire Maple that is up there with their others. A true point-and-click mystery game that allows you to use your brain! And,  NO HIDDEN OBJECT SECTIONS- those fillers that so many devs use,  that I don't like.<br />The graphics are beautiful, and the objects in the inventory responded on the first tap.<br /> I had just been trying to play Age of Enigma,  and,  out of desperation of the tap response not working properly,  checked out the &quot;Recommendations&quot; section,  and saw Mosaika listed. Once I saw it was a Fire Maple game,  and saw the reviews,  I knew it would be among my all-time favorites.<br />I highly recommend this game. But if you like HOGs., always use the Hint button,  and don't have patience,  then skip this one. This is for the TRUE point-and-click mystery game lovers. I play on Kindle Fire 1st generation.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|We had to purchase a different lapel microphone so that we could move forward.  This one stopped working after only a few days of us.
B004QX07G4|5.0|It's like watching a hilarious monologue chapter after chapter. Love me some Ellen! Laughed out loud through the entire book
B007MDB548|5.0|This is a magical movie that completes the four season Tinkerbell series. Disney really knows how to entertain .  Best viewed with a grandchild and popcorn
0812981448|4.0|I heard only a small bit about TOMs.  However I had just finished reading Decision Makers and this book came on my radar screen.  First it is a comfortable read.  It had me asking questions at the end of each chapter, in fact by the first I had bought myself a notebook to jot things down.  I lead a consulting team and we focus on programmes and project which can result in the social and economic inclusion of marginlaised young persons, persons with disAbiliites and mirco entrepreneurs.  I got this book and a notebook for every member of my team and I watched them during breaks reading and nodding their heads.  Somehow the combination of the two books has lead to a more effective and creative team.
B00FKQ4FHS|5.0|They say the cello is the closest instrument to the human voice and it does show in this beautiful collection of 21 arrangements for two cellos and piano/harp (well, four cellos in the case of the Holst piece).<br />From Monteverdi's haunting \\"Interrotte Speranze\\" to the soothing \\"Estonian Lullaby\\" by Arvo Part, Julian Lloyd Webber and his wife Jiaxin take us onto a fantastic journey through more than 500 years of gorgeous music, including Purcell, Schumann, Dvorak, Saint-Saens, Shostakovich, Rachmaninov, just to mention a few.<br />I love the Piazzolla and Hahn's pieces (they alone are worth the price of the CD!).<br />The Ave Maria by Saint-Saens was a very nice change to the more often played Ave Maria by Bach, Gounod, Caccini and Schubert, very nice indeed.<br />Moon Silver, by Julian Lloyd webber's father Willian Lloyd Webber, also deserves a mention. I heard Julian play live in concert \\"In the Half Light\\", also by his father, and I am starting to really like his works.<br />What impressed me about this CD is that the music flows, Julian and his wife Jiaxin make the playing appear so effortless and totally natural, just like the photo on the cover.<br />Lovely to see BBC Young Musician of the Year 2012 Laura van der Heijden appear in the Holst piece, well done, a great achievement for such a young cellist! Thumbs up for all the other supportive artists too, Catrin Finch, Guy Johnston and John Lenehan.<br />Highly recommended, ordering a spare copy for the car now while it stays at this price! :)
B008602KQI|5.0|Its an Amazing movie! ! It will be a great series to watch for when the rest of them come out
B0028AQLYE|5.0|I thought that tis snorkel dry top would leak, but it does not. My old traditional snorkel, you remember the ping pong ball in the basket, was a pain in the butt. This is far superior.
B000H0MKO2|1.0|Parody is one thing -- stupidity is another.  This film is billed as a comedy.  It is as funny as a root canal.  It defines &#34;poor taste.&#34;  If you are considering buying this film I suggest you take a deep breath, then hit the delete button as soon as your reflexes permit.
B008Y212PI|4.0|.<br />Great game, levels from easy to challenging, quick to learn. Our entire family enjoys playing this game. Great for the price
B00129H7VS|5.0|Unbelievably realistic presentation of WWII.  Retired army husband was thoroughly impressed.  Actors seemed especially well-versed and directed.  Couldn't stop watching, and looked forward to what was coming next.
B00F91H666|3.0|This movie pitches itself as a zombie type apocalypse but in reality the movie seems more based on a viral outbreak.  Camera work is erratic and annoying at many points throughout the movie.  Ok on its on merits but for me never really got it quite done...
B00EP22QKG|2.0|I love Joan Jett. I saw her a decade ago and she still rocked it. However, let's be honest... she's no great songwriter. All her biggest hits were either written by other people (I Love Rock N Roll, Do Ya Wanna Touch, Everyday People, Light of Day, Crimson & Clover) or co-written by other people (Desmond Child, Paul Westerberg, Kathleen Hannah, Jim Vallance, etc).<br /><br />Hence, almost all of her albums are really hit or miss. And this is no different. There's a few decent tracks, no real knockouts, and some absolute duds. There's nothing on here that will be on a greatest hits package in 10 years. Still a great live show, still a great rock n roll persona, still lacking songwriting chops.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I luv this game I always enjoy playing with my horse and competing but it also shows how to take care of your horse and see what others are up to so I give it an A++. Love it and it's great for young and young at heart.
B000MDHJFE|5.0|Anatomy of a Murder is one of those American courtroom classics that everyone should watch. Jimmy Stewart delivers his role with perfection and George C. Scott is expertly cast as his opponent. Lawyers and aspiring lawyers will get more out of this classic than most but it's extremely well done for it's time.
0307719774|5.0|Received this as a present just the other day and it is way better than I had anticipated. I am looking forward to writing in this nightly for the next 5 years and reviewing.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It is a program that is geared for adults, very intelligent (once you get over the weirdness),very well acted and with great attention to detail, often very subtle. Quite funny too. It gets better after the first season and gets addictive. Fortunately, for an addict, there are 100 episodes available on Amazon Prime.
079283318X|5.0|Bought as a gift off of wishlist but the person who received the gift loved it and was very happy.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Took me a few tries to figure the game out, but once I got the hang of it, I loved it.  This is a real challenge once you get past the first several levels.  You need to be very good at spacial reasoning.  This game is definitely a keeper and will challenge me for quite some time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was not expecting the story that I just finished, but as I sit here after finishing it in less than a day I am so glad that I got this book. Fantastic, emotional, and funny I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B004YXE438|4.0|It's really nice that this app gives you the ability to make the puzzle as easy or as hard as you need it to be.  Easy level locks the pieces in place when you get them right and shows you edge pieces, medium level shows you edge pieces, while hard level gives you no help.  You also have the choice to choose from a wide variety of piece counts, increasing the difficulty with the more pieces you have.  I find it challenging to go through a few days worth of playing the puzzles and then go back and do them again without the helps and with more pieces.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|Did not like it, I did not want to even rent it but my boyfriend made me rent it. I will not own it at all.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Great game, varying levels of difficulty.  If you love Sudoku, you'll love this game.  Only problem with the app is that it took me just a week to get through all the levels and now I'm getting bored.  The highest level difficulty on the largest board isn't enough for me and it just keeps repeating the same few boards over and over again now.  The nice part is that when you get stuck early on in the game, you can get a hint, but then you can't get another one until the timer resets.  Would really love some additional levels or another edition of this app.
B0015AARJI|5.0|shipping took 2 weeks..but what do you expect if its 25 bucks used? However it was like new and it works very well. i love it. Well my son loves it because its his..i borrow it from time to time when he is in school.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have been thriugh some gruesome things the past this six months. I found the opinions of a brain doctor, who I hope, understands the workings of the brain, to be helpful in becoming less afraid fo some of the memory things I have been bothered with. I feel encouraged to give myself a year to see if my problems get better with the passing of time.
B00EEDJHXA|4.0|Fun to play, it makes you think ahead. you can become addicted to the time it takes to complete a board
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|In the top 5 favorite movies ever! I never tire of this story line. The acting is spot on. Wonderful!
B00E0SX118|3.0|This film is highly overrated.  I found it rather lame but did like the animations.  The beauty of the Croods world was beautiful
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great outing for Jack Reach.  He solves the mystery and saves the day, of course.  Great read that goes quickly by.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I love the characters, costumes and scenery, but I don't care for the sex scenes which don't leave much to the imagination. It's not always necessary to follow a story line exactly.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I wasn't to thrilled about this Iron Man and din't buy the DVD; I rented it for 3 days.  In that 3 days, I watched it 4 times then bought it.  I found it to be very satisfying.  I had less than glowing feelings about #1 and #2, but #3 did it for me.  Special effects were good to great, but not overwhelming the movie story plot line.  That, in the end, and the character development made me care about Stark's emotional development and his discovery of his morality.  Well done Marvel and well acted Downey.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great fun.  The Hobbit takes you into the realm of fantasy in a breathtaking way.  The scenario and the characters are great, funny, and wise.  The dwarfs bring you into their lives and adventures to return to their homeland.  You will not regret adding this, as well as the trilogy, to your collection.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I am in love. The graphics are amazing and the storyline keeps you guessing. I can't wait for the sequel.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig is the epitmoe of what James Bond should be - cold and calculating with a sense of humanity.  Movie is gripping to the end.
B00B4FU6KE|2.0|Not a satisfying read! A good book for discussion in a book club, but I don't like to read books unless I WANT to pick it up, not because I have to finish it!
B005K17RU0|2.0|Recently updated the ap and don't like it as much. Too much info on page and colors of screen look washed out. Why change something that had been a 5 star ap? Bad move.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|John green is my favorite author right now and in this book he didn't fail to please me again. RECOMMEND!!
B007MB5OCE|2.0|I understand that the author was trying to satirize some of history's greatest figures, but he seemed to string  bunch of unbelievable tales together connected by one individual, who really appeared in each case by happenstance.  And the gang that couldn't  shoot straight was more slap stick than I could take.<br />If found a few things amusing ( such as the Bible story) and  Albert Einstein's sister were very clever.<br />Overall I found myself waiting for the punch line at the end of each chapter.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I loved the book, I thought they did a good job with the movie.  I thought the actors were well chosen.

B005FVNIW6|5.0|I am a reader.  What this means is that for the past 40 years of my life I have read 4-8 books a month. I read all genres of fiction.  So when I say I haven't read a book of this caliber in a long time, I mean it. The story is riveting, the characters are well developed, and from the first page I was sucked into a different reality. In four days I read the first three books of this series, and am saving the last one like a child who doesn't want all of his Halloween candy to finish too soon.<br /><br />The book can be read on so many levels.  It is fast paced and easy to read - a definite page turner. On other levels it deals with the issues of  speciesism, religion and science, human belief system, and so many other levels of philosophical discussions. As you read the other books in the series, it goes deeper into these issues.<br /><br />Even though the book was written in 1985, I feel it is timeless and it doesn't feel dated in any way.<br /><br />I have already recommended this book to my two sons to read, and feel it would be a great book to teach in that it would be interesting and fun to read, and a great starter for discussions t afterwards.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent writing and acting.  Kept me glued to it!  It's like reading a book you can't put down. Great guest stars too. Rita Wilson was/is fantastic!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I rate all three this way.<br />1. Iron Man 3<br />2. Iron Man<br />3. Iron Man 2<br /><br />This one just floored me. It had great drama with a wonderful story with a large scope and great dialogue. Gwenith has a much bigger part. Robert is more charismatic than ever. The Hi-Tech gadgets are awesome and fun to watch.

B005LAIIN0|2.0|I admit, while watching I caught a few plot holes and general weirdness, but was generally entertained.<br /><br />While the credits were rolling, however, more and more things started to bother me.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHOY!<br /><br />The zombie piles - Physics? Anybody? No? OK, then.<br /><br />10 seconds to turn - OK, so by the time you actually chopped off Sagan's hand the infection should have already spread to her whole body. Gerry conveniently starts counting after he chops off her hands. Um, no, she was bitten more than 10 seconds ago already.<br /><br />Bites infect you, but zombie blood in your mouth does not?<br /><br />This man may be our last, best hope...so let's send him out into the apocalypse looking for clues with Gerry. With a loaded gun. That he doesn't know how to use. How could that go wrong?<br /><br />We lost cabin pressure, so surely the plane will now crash, because....PLOT DEVICE!<br /><br />Everyone thinks to use rolled up magazines and insulation, nobody has a leather jacket?<br /><br />Let's everyone fly around looking for clues, because radios suddenly stopped working. Even though sat phones still work. And certain radios, apparently.<br /><br />The live humans entering Jerusalem through wire cages do not entice the Zombie horde, but Jewish songs do.<br /><br />There isn't so much a plot as a spiderweb built around holes. Who wants to bet that the sequel is direct to video and stars neither Brad Pitt or Matthew Fox? (Who must be so pleased that most of his scenes were cut.)

B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Being only a casual fan of Megadeth in their heyday, I have recently began listening again, mostly because of my 16 old daughter who is a guitarist and huge fan of Dave Mustaine.  I bought this book for her as a Christmas gift, and I just finished reading it, in just a couple of days.<br /><br />I have so much respect and admiration for him now, mainly because he never blamed others for his problems, and did everything to straighten out his life and career, after many attempts.  He has truly grown up and made peace with most (or all) of his demons.  It saddened me to read that he always felt himself to be in the shadow of Metallica, always trying to compete with their success. He rightly carried a lot of resentment and jealousy for many years because of his failed relationship with them, but had nothing really bad to say about them in this book, he truly took the high road on that.  I believe he has come to terms with it, finally, as he is an exceptionally talented man in his own right.<br /><br />Thank you Dave, for giving us a glimpse into your personal struggles and finally, triumphs.  Love you always, and keep rockin'!!!

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Jack Reacher had a great story and Tom Cruise really showed his action hero chops in this non-stop thriller.  I would recommend this movie is worth the purchase or rental.

B0073COMUW|1.0|I have four LED bulbs from home depot that work quite well in my dining area.  I bought these because they were a bit higher color temperature (closer to daylight) and assumed they would work just as well.  I was incorrect.  These bulbs flicker constantly, and if you try to put them on a dimmer they go into a strobe mode rather than dim.<br />I will return all four.  It was a terrible choice.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|As long as you don't take the movie seriously you will have fun.  Not your typical zombie movie, its a zombie movie with heart.  Its worth your time investment.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Loved the series.  Looking forward to #4.  Jeffrey is a great writer and I just enjoy everything British. Quick reading.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|This movie always seemed rushed to tell the story and you never really feel connected to characters due to their stunted development.  I think if this movie was split into two parts to tell the story more fully it would have gotten a higher rating from me.  Brad Pitt is great on screen but he just seemed hollow; again due to lack of depth of his character.  Most of the others in the movie were forgotten the minute they left the scene.  I would not buy this film with it is worth a spin if you don't have anything else to do.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Sorry to say this was a tedious chore to read.  A real downer!  About the dregs of society.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone.

B000RLH2VM|3.0|Lots of expensive car wrecks; ensemble cast, including Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno, violence and gunplay; car chases; location filming in France.

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This superbly-paced thriller takes us on a roller-coaster ride of paranormal thrills, spills and conspiracies. We meet 16-year-old Nathan Ryder, who is in the process of discovering his psychic nature and heritage. The `Outviews' of the title refer to his `journeys' back into bloody moments of history (the Black Plague, the American Revolutionary War, the slave trade, etc.) where he experiences a series of hideous and fearsome deaths. He hears voices (just as his now institutionalized brother once did), has premonitions, sees auras, practises telekinesis, and begins to suspect that his father's earlier death may well have been a murder orchestrated as part of a CIA government conspiracy. The author brilliantly marshals these disparate elements into the riveting tale of a group of teenagers combatting corruption in high places and entering ever deeper into a world of astral planes, time vortexes and time portals, culminating in a finale of expertly-wrought tension and excitement. Check it out.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is a great movie!  I recommend it! This 20013 Star Trek movie directed by JJ Abrams is a guilty pleasure because the film is a homage to Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan (1982)!  I like the movie because it is tribute the original Star Trek crew and the character Khan (originally played by the late Ricardo Montalban!) The movie is tribute to what happened before. Chris Pine is Captain James T. Kirk, Zackary Quinto is Mr. Spock,and Bennedict Cummberback is the new 2013 version of Khan!  Bruce Greenwood is Captain Christopher Pike, Peter Weller is Admiral Marcus, Alice Eve is Carol Marcus, and Simon Pegg is Cheif Engineer Montgomery Scott, John Cho is Mr. Sulu! Original Star Trek actor, Leonard Nimoy has a cameo as \\"Spock Prime\\"! A Great Movie! A
B007RFDQN4|2.0|As a Chaplin fan, I wish this film had not been made.  I was going to give up at &#34;Sorry children, we're having fish-heads again for dinner&#34; or something like that.  Tough.  Tough.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I've been interested in the historical Jesus for some time, and you won't find a better book on him than this.  The contemporary comparative Theologian, Reza Aslan, has the people's touch and is able to render a complex story in an understandable way, much as Carl Sagan used to do for the cosmos.  There are really only four independently verifiable facts about Jesus: that he was born in Nazarene to a peasant family, that he was baptized by John the Baptist, that he led a three-year itinerant ministry, and that he was crucified under Pontius Pilate.  The Gospels, while useful in setting forth Jesus' teachings, are completely unreliable as historical documents, and Aslan does a very good job of explaining why this is so and how much the Gospels were influenced by the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, and how much the Gospel writers did not want to antagonize the Romans.  It also becomes clear how much in the Jewish Messianic tradition Jesus was and how unlikely it is that Jesus was intending to start his own religion.  In any case, in some ways this is more a biography of Jesus' time than a biography of the man himself.  Needless to say, if you're interested only in the Jesus of scripture and believe him to be your Lord and Savior, this unvarnished examination of the historical man, as much as we can examine him, might not be the book for you.

0385344228|1.0|The macro idea of this book (the crime itself and the challenges that lawyers and DAs face trying to discover the truth) are interesting but the execution (the writing) is bad. Too many long, shallow (sometimes meaningless) and repetitive descriptions and dialogues in a failed attempt to develop the characters and provide interesting insights into life or people. My impression sometimes was that the author kept writing and writing without knowing where to go with the story. I wanted to know what happened and kept reading until the end but was annoyed with the many boring, shallow pages. I don't recommend.

0060556501|4.0|I just finished reading the complete Chronicles of Narnia and thought this would be a good way to introduce my grandkids to Narnia. The storyline seems like it only hits the high points, but doesn't give much feeling and expression. Could be because I still have the Chronicles so fresh in my head. Beautiful drawings.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very relaxing puzzle game that is easy to pick up. Not a major brain bender, but a pleasant way to wind down. Some of the pictures you reveal are a bit humorous when you notice both fresh and salt water fish swimming on a reef, for instance. The sound is minimal but well done. The crashing sound when you break a block is oddly satisfying.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice little reveal the picture puzzler, this would be a good choice.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|amazing story line! sent shivers up my spine with the possibilities of what could happen in our world today. very compelling reading!
0486290492|5.0|Much though I love [[ASIN:1853260002 Pride and Prejudice]], and although Lizzie will always be my favourite Austen character, for me Sense and Sensibility is the better of the two books overall. That's not to say it's more enjoyable - P&P definitely wins out on both humour and romance. But in Sense and Sensibility, I feel Austen paints a more realistic picture of the lives of the 'gentry' of her period, and in this book we see much more clearly the constraints placed on young men, as well as on the women. The main thrust of the book is on the contrast of personality between the reserved and sensible Elinor and the frenetic romanticism of Marianne, but for me the more interesting element is what the book tells us about Austen's late 18th/early 19th century society.<br /><br />The book starts with a similar premise to P&P; the Dashwood family, all girls, find themselves forced to leave their home and reduced to genteel poverty when, on the death of their father, his house and estate pass down through the male line to the girls' half-brother, John. There is, of course, no possibility that the girls could work, so they must survive on the little income they have, and look to kindly relatives (all male) to assist them. The only other alternative is to achieve a good match.<br /><br />But in S&S, we also see the other side of the coin - Edward (Elinor Dashwood's love interest) is an eldest son and as such has been brought up to be ornamental (which he's not very good at) and useless (a skill he has pretty much mastered). And so his life is not his own - he must marry to please his mother or risk losing the wealth he has grown up to expect. But as a wealthy young man of a good family, he is considered a good match, despite this combination of uselessness and spinelessness. (Edward's eventual `heroism' was forced on him, so he deserves no praise for it.) Then we have Sir John Middleton: a kindly and generous man, distant relative of Mrs Dashwood, who offers the family not just a cottage on his estate, but also his friendship and concern for their future (i.e., marriage prospects). And how do the Dashwoods repay him? By looking down on his taste and manners, and the vulgarity of his relations by marriage. The nuances of a multi-tiered class-ridden society, where every tier is jealous of the one above while despising those below, are already becoming clear.<br /><br />There are things I don't like about S&S, but these too tend to shed light on the same class divides and gender roles. Lucy Steele is a much-maligned young lady, in my opinion. Why shouldn't she have become betrothed to Edward? Should she really have said 'No, no, I am too vulgar to marry such a sophisticated (and rich) young man'? What was it they all despised her for, except her birth and lack of education - two things she could not control? Why is Edward considered noble for sticking to an engagement he entered into willingly, while Lucy is reviled for not freeing him from it? Is Mrs Dashwood's desire to marry her daughters to rich, or at least well-established, men any different to Lucy's desire to escape her relative poverty through rich connections? And since everyone despises her anyway, why shouldn't she act as she does at the end? I'm always rather glad that things work out for Lucy - she reminds me a little of a less entertaining, but more successful, Becky Sharp.<br /><br />And then there's Colonel Brandon - and of course I love him. But I can't help feeling a little queasy that he fixes his passions on a seventeen-year-old girl barely out of the schoolroom and clearly immature. But he's a rich landowner, and so again seen as a good match, and although Marianne makes it clear from the outset that she sees him as an old man, her entire family encourage her to think of him as a potential suitor. Would they have had he been poor, or even just comfortably off? Lastly Willoughby (the hottest boy in the county, according to the blurb for the [[ASIN:0007461763 Joanna Trollope remake]]) - a rake, yes, but does what he does because he can't face disinheritance and, despite ruining one young woman and breaking another's heart, gains back his place in respectable society within a very short space of time, by making a good though loveless match.<br /><br />Not as sparkling as P&P, but with much more depth, Sense and Sensibility shows more clearly how this society operated through family alliances and marriage, with the young people of both sexes expected to conform to the wishes of their elders and marry for social advancement. While Lizzie and Jane are whisked off at the end, Mills & Boon style, to great houses and handsome men, the matches made by Elinor and Marianne are less glitzy but probably more realistic. Both books are great in their own right, but together they give a much fuller picture of the nuances of this complex society, where money and birth determined status and worth in an ever-fluctuating pattern. Needless to say, really, but highly recommended.<br /><br />I read the book in the highly recommended [[ASIN:B004WBJ5T0 Delphi Complete Works of Jane Austen (Illustrated)]] for Kindle.ollope remake]]) - a rake, yes, but does what he does because he can't face disinheritance and, despite ruining one young woman and breaking another's heart, gains back his place in respectable society within a very short space of time, by making a good though loveless match.<br /><br />Not as sparkling as P&P, but with much more depth, Sense and Sensibility shows more clearly how this society operated through family alliances and marriage, with the young people of both sexes expected to conform to the wishes of their elders and marry for social advancement.

B00E3JGCHO|5.0|Most of the reviews for this product have been transplanted from the 4CD/1DVD box set the Band released more or less simultaneously with this two CD set. I would guess you would have to be a bit of a hard core Band fan to pony up 80 bucks for a big ol box set and honestly I own their greatest hits and the Basement Tapes (the Dylan Columbia release, not some hard core bootleg which costs hundreds) and thought I owned all the Band material I would ever want. Years ago, I began to watch the Last Waltz on TV and quit after about 25 minutes while I wondered what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I went to the local record store yesterday and noticed this nice 2 CD set of the Live at the Academy of Music by the Band. I had read the Rolling Stone review which give it five stars or something and praised it to the skies--but you know, I am one of those cynical hipsters who thinks Rolling Stone is full of it--and I thought, well, if I find anything else, maybe I'll buy it..........<br /><br />And I was just about to leave when the record store clerk (who knows me) walked up and said \\"Man we got all this used old blues in\\" and I went over and grabbed 5 or 6 old blues CDs, and thought, well, what the heck, I'll buy the Band CD too.<br /><br />And was I ever glad I did. This may be the single greatest rock live album I have ever heard. These guys are playing in some incredible zone, tossing off great solos and great vocals. The sound is amazing, so immediate that even on my little cheap Sony stereo they sound great. I would wager that on an audiophile system this CD would be divine!<br /><br />These brilliant musicians are rediscovering their own music--living in it--and playing loose, furious and supertight--all at the same time!<br /><br />This is a must have 2 CD set! Buy it, I don't care if your favorite music is rock or raga, counterpoint or calypso, you will love this CD for its incredible good feeling and intense great musicianship.

B005K17RU0|1.0|There is far too much &#34;stuff&#34; unrelated to the weather forecast.  I want just the forecast; not a bunch of other articles.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app is tied in with facebook so the more friends you have playing, the better.  You can trade extra items with your friends.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Game decides what moves you make.  You cannot always put cards where YOU want them.  I need five more words.
B00BOTCKCW|5.0|Wonderful, high -quality, enthralling story, highly recommend this to all BBC, Masterpiece Classic, HBO fans. Rebecca Hall, Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast all spot on. Production values, screenwriting do justice to Ford Maddox Ford's original work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well developed story lines and fantastic acting from everyone -- and I mean everyone!  Why isn't there something this good in the United States -- next to, of course, Scandal, Suits, Covert Affairs, Breaking Bad and White Collar?
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|As usual - Sanderson delivers a very very readable book. The writing isn't China meiville - but the characters are interesting, nuanced, likeable and complex. There's plenty to be mined here for sequels (I almost can't wait for more). It' an altogether rollicking good time!
B00026ZG10|3.0|Schwarzenegger, Curtis and Arnold combine to make a movie combining marital suspicious/problems, a crisis involving stolen Russian nuclear warheads, and a ridiculous attempt at a running comedy throughout. The film is mildly interesting at first, but eventually becomes farcical and boring.
B0029EDMEG|3.0|Of course it's kinda corny, but I liked it.  Also slow, so it's not something to put on if a buddy is over.  Kinda have to like Selleck.
B00011CZRE|5.0|Newly transferred Brad Pitt is assigned to help retiring homicide detective Morgan Freeman. The two immediately become deeply involved in cases involving a sadistic serial killer whose murders link to the seven deadly sins. In the first - representing gluttony, an obese man was forced to eat himself to death. The second involves the murder of a rich attorney (greed).<br /><br />Pitt and Freeman track down the killer (Spacey) using library records to identify anyone checking out books related to the case. Returning to the police station after almost capturing Spacey, they're greeted by Spacey turning himself in. The ending involves another horrible death, and the completion of representing all of the seven deadly sins.
B0094MFITS|3.0|Of course it's kinda corny, but I liked it.  Also slow, so it's not something to put on if a buddy is over.  Kinda have to like Selleck.
B00513DEWM|3.0|DECIDED TO READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE I HAD SEEN THE MOVIE DECADES AGO AND DIDN'T REMEMBER THE ENDING.<br />IT GAVE AN INDEPTH REVIEW OF CHARACTERS AND TIME PERIOD.  THE AUTHOR DID RAMBLE ON IN A FEW CHAPTERS<br />ABOUT THE RICHES THAT WERE DORIAN GRAY'S THRU THE YEARS, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT WITHOUT TAKING AWAY FROM THE STORY.  OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE READ!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book! This is the first book I've read by this author and I'll have to get another one! Real characters, interesting insight into human nature.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|A wonderful movie. Magnificently produced, lovely acting.  This is a movie you can watch with your children, and you will like it as much as they will.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this series.<br />Great cast and well executed.<br /><br />It's like CSI but for Lawyers!<br /><br />I look forward to completing the rest of the series.

0740748475|5.0|I was looking at buying this set at a bookstore, but the price is MUCH better here!  The books were perfect.  I used to love reading Calvin & Hobbes in my bed as a child, so I'm really excited to have to full collection now to read with my husband!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Does its job well; I needed something to give a little better than 500mA, and this does it as advertised. It's only been a couple weeks, but no problems so far.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Survival craft is better than this. This game doesn't have a lot of graphics. If you like really lame things you should get this game
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Every song on this album has a catchy yet soothing melody, and the overall style of this group is far from what you hear everyday.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Love the originality of the sci-fi/western and the character interactions, but the show did contain themes I found highly objectionable (especially the &#34;respectability&#34; of Inara's being a licensed &#34;companion&#34;...and her doing business with both sexes).  Given the show's short run I'm not sure whether this readily apparent conflict of legally endorsed moral depravity would have been explored for its real-life impact on our own society (abortion, gay marriage, etc.), but I find that highly doubtful.  It also seemed like the show more than once went to heavy lengths to make &#34;Christians&#34; (or people who were transparently similar) look very backward and superstitious.<br /><br />I love Joss Whedon as a director and his handling of large casts as he demonstrated in The Avengers.  But as much as I wanted to fall in love with Firefly and its intriguing universe, to me it was held back by these issues.  Sometimes I'm left wondering how much the writing of a show simply reflects the larger nature of its world and those who inhabit it, or is actually propagandizing an agenda.  With sci-fi especially, the latter has often been the case throughout the genre's history.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played this is one of the most popular game that I have.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Great movie, different than the book but it was very good, I wish there would have been more zombie action, good movie
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I gave this book a five as I would the majority of Stephen Kings books. We finally find out what happens to Danny, and what a ride it was. Very suspenseful and exciting.<br />I have read most of Stephen's books and love his style. This was right up there with the rest of his work.The climax was pretty fast and almost a letdown, but didn't hurt the book any. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Stephen or if you like a good suspenseful edge of your seat ride! Loved it!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|This move made me so nervous from the utter chaos not to mention bored. I do not recommend this movie.
B00BV5FVR0|4.0|Mad world, mad plot and sane survivalists but one can't help but read on and ask 'what if the world really turns out like this?'
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|My husband cried over this move. A great romantic movie with and amazing twist at the end. If you like Romance movies, watch this. You will cry like a baby like my husband did.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a great game and very addicting !  Lots of fun and never have a problem with  the game.  Don't need a WiFi connection to play.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This was a funny and sweet zombie movie. I love the witty and funny dialogue they gave the zombies. This is a must watch if you have any sense of humor at all.
0810996596|5.0|This is a fine book with unsurpassed paper & print quality. What's more, it is a tremendous value for the money. Kirk's collection of horror is all encompassing and presented here with superb photography and layout. Like most people who purchased this book, I have a few of the items presented, but his collection (probably only a small portion of it is in this book!) is awesome. Though not really a Metallica fan, though they have 2 good albums (Black & Garage, Inc.), I've always considered them a poor man's version of Sabbath. However, I love his book and his interest in a subject I also cherish. And he does in fact discuss the correlation of Black Sabbath and their namesake, the 1963 Karloff film.<br /><br />One small disappointment for me; as I was paging through the art work section, I was hoping to find one or more of the original paintings from Rod Serling's Night Gallery tv show. With the hundred or so they did, Kirk certainly has the means and contacts to acquire a couple. These macabre items seem like they would be right up his alley. Perhaps he's working on it and they'll appear in an updated edition of his book!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|We couldn't wait to get these dvds and we have been enjoying watching these great quality dvds of Dr. Quinn. Great for the family!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I think all 3 books must be read to fill in all the blanks.  It is an eye opener on a part of the World I believed was far different than the U.S.  Obviously, I was way off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It is so much fun  and it is really entertaining to play because of the realism
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is a great drama! I love the emotion and politics in this movie. It is a great portrayal of the difficulties encountered in life.
B008Y212PI|4.0|really addictive, but not amusing. I would recommend this to someone who likes relaxing puzzles. this is not at all an exiting or epic game
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a great show.  The characters are amazing and complex. Juliana Margulies plays the part of Alica Florrick so very well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the characters and I love the story lines for each character.  The writing sometimes seems like the author is trying to fill up space like the soldier who said he was a Crawley and the affair  with lord Crawley and the maid.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|If you're an opera fan, you're use to excellent voices. But if you're interests are pop or country, you don't hear the type of voice Adam Lambert gives us in these beautiful songs. Apparently he wrote most of them, and they are fantastic for listening, dancing or exercising. Shady done with Nile Rodgers should be played day and night on the radio. It is a totally perfect song. Underneath showcases Mr. Lambert's magnificent voice and is somewhat dark. Several tremendous dance numbers. Makes you wonder why we all don't get the opportunity to hear this music on the radio instead of just my playlist.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The authors are well-respected writes on IT operations and processes.  Their book on Visible Ops has been on my frequent give-away list.  The value of this book as a novel is that it puts the story of DevOps into an easily digestible form where the value of mature IT processes to the business is conveyed emotionally as well as intellectually.  It is a great first read introduction to the topic that will make IT practitioners and business people ready for the work necessary to make the effort to align IT to the business, since every business function is now an IT function.
B002E01MHY|5.0|So refreshing to see one of these Italian films that doesn't center around a ponderous female lead and a bevy of stage lesbians.  &#34;The New York Ripper&#34; is different in that it is told from the perspective of a male lead and most of the suspects are men.<br /><br />This film probably seems more &#34;controversial&#34; today than it did in 1982.  I remember when it came out and there was a flood of violent, intensely sexual thrillers playing theaters at the time: dozens of slasher films and even comedies like &#34;Porky's&#34; which were huge hits but would never make it past censors or &#34;family values&#34; police in 2013.<br /><br />Enjoy it for what it is: an entertaining, engaging and well-paced thriller with sleaze, thrills, suspense and a wonderful, trick ending.  Much recommended!
B004FWXKXS|5.0|This movie is great if you like survival stories. It is interesting to see the true character of people come out under trial. Anthony Hopkins does a great job of playing a billionaire who must use his skills to help people who only use him. The scenery is tremendous!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I really like this book it's really incredible to read I will say that towards the end it gets a bit less descriptive but other than the dated style of slang (for example the expression right on), that was my only complaint about it ,and most of the book was very descriptive and very enjoyable. I highly recommend this book especially to people who like action/adventure or drama, and books that really make you think about what your reading.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The show is a little bit campy, but I think that's just because it's British.  Very good show overall, looking forward to the next seasons.
1416955070|5.0|This book is extremely amazing! I love it! It has romantic, action; even men would love this book!!! GO BUY IT.
1594202273|5.0|This book, while occasionally getting too specific, is a fantastic overview of the evolution of the mechanisms designed to prevent unintended nuclear war and a harrowing look at how close we came.  Reading about some of the first weapons, learning about the thousands of accidents (both major and minor) with nuclear weapons makes one realize that we made it through the cold war alive more by luck than anything else.
B004EBBPU0|3.0|The outstanding thing about this movie is the the soundtrack of Doors songs is well-matched to the storyline of the movie.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I have only watched the first 3 episodes and they are excellent.  Kudos for Claire Danes' winning the Emmy.  She is so fantastic in it.  Can't wait to see more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the way Green wrote his book like a screenplay. It was so easy to connect and fall in love with the characters. I feel like a better person for reading this book.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|This was an intense book in places, but really inspirational as well. I loved that you found out everything that led the author to where she was. Self re-discovery while walking hundreds of miles. Fantastic.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is great for the whole family. There some glitches here and there but other then I love it.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, despite putting it down once at the beginning and leaving it for a week or two. Once I got into it, the book became really interesting.
1608870081|5.0|The paper art is very well done and captures the story of hero, Harry Potter.  Will make a nice gift for the holidays or birthdays.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|There are two few of these offerings.  We need more from Josh.  This is a great listening experience.  I enjoy his writing.
0375428550|5.0|This book is amazing. I studied it for less than a month and did my test few days ago. The test looked very familiar to me as the book gave me great background about the test. I love this book and the CD made it even easier to get to know the test more and more.
B00BJDARGO|5.0|Whitesnake shows are always good and as a Bonus this show features Brian Tichy on drums....Great Show !<br />All around great musicians !
B004UID2LC|5.0|Hi, been trying to download stuff on PC to sync with Kindle Fire, Music/Videos Etc. This App takes seconds to download on Kindle Fire (Free) and I have access to 'Everything I needed' It all can Listened to, or viewed at any time without Wifi Connection. Great !!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Quick download to my kindle fire hd. Controls are very smooth and easy to use. Excellent graphics and music. The object of the game is to get the apples and advance to the next level. Great for all ages.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't know if this could be as good as the first. But I think it may be even better. I am so addicted to the series! On to the next!
B000002A33|5.0|I've been a fan since the 90's, and have loved everything they have done, but this album is BEYOND perfect.  We're talking, PEARL JAM's TEN, ALICE IN CHAINS's DIRT,  LIVE's THROWING COPPER, SOUNDGARDEN's  BADMOTORFINGER
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love this series and the historical fiction of the drama during this period of history in England.  I am waiting for the next one to be published.
B001MSMULG|3.0|I enjoy espionage fiction and decided to read some of Silva' s work based on his interview with Stephen Colbert. I like his flow of story and characters. I started this genre with James Baldacci when he first surfaced. Silva' s writing keeps me with the story much like Baldacci did in the beginning.  Ludlum still reigns supreme for me however!
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|My two year old daughter loves this film.  She asks to watch it almost every day.  She loves when the little girl says &#34;da da daaaaaaa!&#34;
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I find this game relaxing,skill sharpener and addictive.  Once I start, got to push myself. Would recommend to family and friends.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This  an awesome app and I love it.it's so entertaining especially when u are bored . It makes u happy and u don't need WiFi at all. What a wonderful app this is
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is hilarious!!! I love unlocking the new minions!! Freeze ray and more are included. I really like the menna and vector battles:)
159463176X|2.0|This book did not hold my interest like this author's first two books, which I absolutely loved. Somehow, I think there was too much back and forth between time periods and characters, and I have not been able to bring myself to finish the book-The brother and sister that were separated early in the story, have not reconnected, and I was thinking that would be what would have happened before the last 100 pages. I think there were too many details instead of just getting to the point of the story. I was a bit disappointed, although many of my friends loved this book.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This show follows Sarah Conner's and her son John. Cameron shows up on the seen early. Played by Summer Glau. As the one who protects John Conner. The show is exciting and has a lot of action ans so much more. It's a great story. It took me getting through the first 3 episodes to actually being a bit addicted to it.<br /><br />I can't believe I didn't watch this when it was on TV.  I really wish a lot more people would have because there's only 2 seasons and I so wanted to see more. I was a little annoyed by a couple things I seen a lot in the first 2-3 episodes, but after that they seemed to change those things and it became an even greater show. The cast and their characters grow on you. I loved when Brian Austin Green joined the show also.
1579128955|5.0|this book has excellent pictures and informative commentary on the elements. this is a must-have for any chemist. buy it.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Loved it.  Sorry I waited till the end to begin..........I will watch them all, one by one to the bitter end!!
B001BANK32|5.0|read this years ago but wanted to re-read this before the sequel came out. one of my favorite king books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever. It is alot better than subway surf.and if I were you I would buy this game
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|Could have gotten this movie for seven dollars less,  locally.  Amazon price protection did nothing for me on this one.  Movie, however, is great.  Highly recommended.
B000I186FW|2.0|It was really interesting and I liked the action. The storyline was very strange though and I don't enjoy gory movies.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|The only issue I have is the slop play the of the droid player other wise the game is great
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|You sent the movie today.  Without an invoice.  Please send one by E-mail!  It is bedtime.  I am not going to fool with this.<br /><br />David Parsons
B005HED11Y|5.0|Have always loved Star Trek and now with the upgraded graphics it is fun to watch again.  Ok ... like I really need a reason to watch it again :)
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like this much better than the stock PDF viewer that comes with the Kindle. Text Zooming and page scaling is much better. The only trouble is the page load time when flipping pages seems to lag a bit.
B007704HO6|5.0|I loved every minute spent reading this book and am thrilled to see it goes on! I have 4 of these beautiful creatures and was privilaged to be godmother to Leo, who unfortunately had to leave this world way too early. This wonderful book shows that people can really learn alot about life through these majestic animals! I am really proud of James and Bob, they truly are &#34;soulmates&#34;...
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I have this same application on my phone too. It is fantastic for rummaging around the filesystem for where to a file is kept or where to put one you are transferring.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Long time fan of the originals.  Love what JJ is doing with these remakes.  Yes, lots of re-treading, but in a new and different perspective.  Can not wait for the next installment,
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written, gripping novel. Awesome character development.  Kept me up late at night reading. Had to know what happened next!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Incredibly written, this book has everything the popular HBO series has plus an outstanding insight into the rich history George R. R. Martin created for his setting. This book is an intense read that will keep you turning the pages.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|This movie was awesome, highly recommended if you like action & Machete Kills will be out next week !! !
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I listened to a couple of songs on the Amazon sample and they sounded pretty good.  I already LOVED Radioactive, so with the few songs I heard sounding OK...I took a chance.  Was I ever pleasantly surprised!  What a GREAT CD first to last song. Love it!  I recommend listening to the short clips on Amazon if you are not sure, see if they sound like something that you'd like to hear more of....if they are...buy this CD. You won't be disappointed!
B00F56AZK4|4.0|I think that this app is cool, it just needs more puzzles because I did all of them the first day I hot this app. MORE PUZZLES! MORE PUZZLES! Anyone with Me?
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|I have to admit, I love the Eagles and bought this along with a 2-CD collection of their greatest hits. I was disappointed in Long Road. There are some great musical sounds but once the singing and the lyrics start....something just goes awry. Not at all what I expected. If I had it to do over again, nope....
B004LROUNG|5.0|I will read anything Grisham writes, he hasn't let me down, yet. I anticipate rainy days with  his books and a wool quilt.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I haven't read a lot of science fiction, so this was a fabulous introduction. The end seemed abrupt and unclear regarding the passage of time.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|The mystery portion was good.  If you are the sort of person who becomes involved with the characters in the books you read this book is enjoyable because it provides follow-up of the lives of many of the characters in Jane Austen's novels.  Dispels the illusion that everyone lives happily ever after.
0316228583|5.0|I was excited to get this book, being a huge harry potter fan. The story was slow in the beginning, and I actually put it down for a few months until I picked it up again a few days ago, and I haven't put it down until I finished it today. Admittedly, I like books some may consider dry or boring, and I love getting very involved in character's lives (dickens anyone?), so this was right up my alley. I saw parts of myself in these characters, even things that weren't so flattering. I think it paints a good picture of how people can get so involved in themselves and their own feelings that they become blind to what other people may be thinking about the same situation, and do not think about where their actions will ultimately take them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book, and would recommend that you at least make it a few chapters in before you decide you don't like it. I can't wait to read more of her work.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent book for discussion in book clubs. It raises many questions about what makes a life worth living and it reminds you how quickly life can change in a moment.
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|Initailly I was apprehensive about buying a disc I hadn't heard any music from as most cd's you might like one or two songs and that's it. This cd, I like every song! More I listen the more I like it. Great purchase!
0399534601|5.0|Whether you are a child or an adult, this book helps you awaken to the little things in life that have meaning.  Too often, we travel through our days never noticing what is around us.  The playful exercises in this book raise our awareness.
B0045HCJRQ|2.0|it was ok, but I wanted more civil war action,,the film location was great and beautiful, but I think it needed a script
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this for my parents because they wanted it and just from looking at the box it looked like it was going to be a boring game.  But I was wrong!  There is a lot of strategy that goes into winning this game. It takes about an hour or so to play a single game but that hour goes by fast!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is perfect for going on vacation instead of trying to learn some of the alarm clocks they have in hotels now a days...very bright, your own music perfect
B009JZSC9S|5.0|One of our favorite series ever.  Not only good acting but good stories.  Looking forward to the next season already.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate the upgraded version I wish they would bring back the other one. It was a lot easier to find the things you wanted to look at.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book is ok they're some good stuff and horrible thing in this book Jeff kinney is a funny author and I love his books

B00000D9TQ|5.0|great hits from the movies white night against all odds and his many other hits as well are the greatest vocal artist gone solo ... you will enjoy all these great songs...
B00ESY77LO|1.0|The movie itself deserves 5 stars. Amazon's picture and sound quality were beyond horrible! DO NOT RENT MOVIES LIKE THIS FROM AMAZON. It was pixelated, blurry... ugh I was so disappointed. I had seen it on blu-ray... I must say, wow! Amazon, you didn't even respond to my complaint. I'll never waste 5 dollars renting a movie from you again.
B00006JIA4|5.0|all their greatest hits on the radio and in the movies became a great recording artist .. Freddy Mercury 's voice was amazingly great and he could sing anything even opera.. this man had talented moments which other's never knew he had...
0425252868|5.0|This is a wonderful true story of a german pilot who also had the integrity and conscience to not follow mindless nazi rhetoric.  His family suffered loss and struggled with a war that they didn't not always agree with.  He comes to understand the human condition that develops in war-time, and in a turning-point in his life, must make a decision as to finish off a badly damaged American fighter or assist them in leaving german territory.  Pictures enhance this true story of courage and moral struggles that define a man's principles.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The product really good, got good range. Last very long. But when I charge it it makes this beeming sound occasionally. Voice morphing it's great. Easy to set up. G keys are amazing.
B00ECLU346|2.0|Predictable, not very funny, they made two movies too many. Amazon should have had it to rent not to buy,
B00068TJM6|5.0|Dear Amazon,<br /><br />The watch is fine. This is my first occassion whereby I ordered an item that may be subject to Dominican<br />Import Tax Duty and that resulted in a complicated process. Firstly, UPS charged me USD 40 for Customs<br />paperwork and then I was advised that I had to pay USD 200 Customs Duty. According tothe Customs, the<br />watch was described as a &#34;luxury item&#34; which of course it is not and eventually I managed to have the duty<br />reduced to USD 100. FYI Import Tax is levied here on any item ,new or reconditioned with value over USD 200<br />and I doubt that I will make any further orders with you that fall into the Import Tax bracket.<br /><br />Regarding the PG Tips Tea Bags, this order was never received. Medideals refunded me the full cost as apparently the order had been sent somewhere on two occassions by their courier company but were damaged and returned to Medideals. Somehow I find this hard to believe and I advised Medideals that I am not a satisfied customer. Being British and a tea drinker I particularily wanted this order as PG Tips Tea Bags are not available in Dominican Republic.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|The disk and the case both had a couple scratches/smudges, but it works excellently.  It was a really good purchase.

B00985E3UG|5.0|Great book. Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us by Michael Moss is the most informative book I've read on the food industry and it's role in the obesity epidemic and health care crisis in the United States and around the world. A true milestone.
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|My child just loves this game. She likes the fact that she can change it as many times as she wants.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is a fast-paced, thrilling story with a clever twist. A serial killer is back in town, and he's taking out anyone in the town of Rockton, IL, who wastes his time. The new detective duo, Larking and Fairlane are on the case, but the first violent murder of the Bjornson family already has the partners fighting. Fairlane is untested, Larkin is testy, and the clues are adding up to something neither wants to face.<br /><br />Then Larking starts to remember....<br /><br />This gripping story is a one-night read. You won't be able to put the book down as you race to the end, along with the two protagonists trying to stop the next gruesome murder. This crime-thriller is well-plotted with interesting characters and gory murder scenes. Exactly what you want from a crime drama. An exciting first novel from Todd M. Thiede, and I, for one, am looking forward to his next.

B0002IQMKM|5.0|Great CD, everybody loves The Talking Heads.  This is a great blast from the past with soo many great songs on it.  We listen to it all the time.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|When I started reading I wasn't sure I wanted to keep reading but I did and found the story very intriguing with a very surprising ending. One could say it was a love story of a different kind. I had been to Ireland in 2012 & was able to picture in my mind the descriptions in the book. Recommend reading g it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this series can't wait to read book three.Gideon and Eva are hot even with all of their baggage the make you wanna be them.

B0027ZCQ4E|4.0|Rented this movie using my Smart TV that is synced with my Amazon account.<br /><br />Just took seconds and I was knee deep in the original Bourne movie.<br /><br />And it looked incredible.<br /><br />Still blows my mind that I can get such good quality over wifi instead of using a DVD or Blu-Ray, for example.<br /><br />Good times we're living in.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|The book is slow and too hard to get into.  I read 80 pages and just didn't feel like reading anymore.
B002KEZ96Y|4.0|A cult film I was tired of pretending to have seen, around friends.<br />All the references they drop just made me feel like I had seen the movie.<br /><br />But I hate people who just do not care enough to watch a classic.<br /><br />It annoys me how many people have not seen The Godfather, for example.<br /><br />So I had to follow my own rule. Rented it over Amazon Prime streaming using my Smart TV and spent the next hour or two enjoying this movie.<br /><br />Great cast, good writing and all the references made sense.<br />BTW, did Goodman win 'Best Supporting Actor' by chance?<br />He should have.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|The Broadway show way fantastic and way beyond my expectations.  Now, having the CD, I can learn all the lyrics and keep the experience alive!

B008Y212PI|5.0|What a great logic game! I've had lots of fun solving the grid puzzles, and am happy there are different levels of difficulty. Good choice for the price.
1441761268|5.0|I almost did not get this book on Audible when I read the reviews.  Then, I decided I would not let a few bad ratings stop me, because for the most part I find I do feel the same.  This book was one I became so absorbed in, could not quit listening.  I was totally captivated by the characters.  It was simply just a beautiful and well told story.  It alsmo got me interested in researching Amercan Slavery and now just want to know more about these people and their lives.  You will not be disappointed in this book.  Absolutely enjoyed it and will most likely listen to it several times.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can't say much that others haven't said. The thing just works. Plug it in, and you'll be streaming Netflix, Youtube, and now Hulu Plus in minutes. at $35 you can't really go wrong. I imagine before Christmas Google will release the SDK (this means people can build things to work for it), and then we will see the real possibilities of this little guy.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|liked all the ironman movies, the oringals are almost alwas the best, no exception here. this one is alittle more quirky than the rest but still some good action scenes and of course cool technology
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love the game but don't get attached to your village.  After putting hundreds of hours it reaches a point then &quot;you cannot go any further without updates&quot; .  Then in the end we can't find the update and it certainly isn't doing it on its on.  Auto updates are on. It sends me to app store. The app store sends me to &quot;you cannot go any further without an update.&quot; Its a circle.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|have two preteens, we all watched the movie and enjoyed it, it wasnt bad at all yet we all thought it was going to be better

B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great casting, well acted, legal drama with a fun and ironic twist. Nice to see some talented actors back at work.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|Nice album there are really some great songs on there especially pound cake with jay z he went in on there!
B00DOQK2OG|5.0|I've always been a Ritchie blackmore fan, especially his rainbow project<br />with various vocalists. this has a little of all the eras with a different vocalist<br />who seems to pull it off o.k.<br />Pretty decent for a live album!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So, i never review books. I read them on my kindle & i hate typing on this thing (hence the lack of caps). But, i couldn't let this go by without telling people how great it is! And let me add, I'm not a huge sci-fi reader. This book had me completely hooked from the first chapter. Lots of twists, lots of unexpected turns, i couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the rest!!
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|I purchased the cd when I bought the dvd to get both. this is a decent like album<br />where Ritchie plays pretty good, and the whole band seems to work well!!!<br />I'd recommend it to die-hard rainbow fans like myself!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The book was very interesting.  Kept you on your toes.  had a twist ending.<br />I liked the book very much
B005FISC52|3.0|again I can't rate this either, it was bought as a gift for my wife which likes the show!!!<br />so I beleave she likes them!!!!
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Has many points and perspectives that professional sales people overlook. I really like the concept of &#34;Hot Cognitions&#34;, as that is something that all proposals and deals need in order to get it done quickly.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|anything steve morse is in, I usually like, and this ain't no exception.<br />all the players are really good on this cd. nice to listen to!!!!!
B00F35BV64|4.0|Loved this show - messes with your head having seen all the older Star Treks. The characters were very well assigned to these acters who do not fail.
B007LKHP2I|5.0|I really like john 5 as a solo artist. he is a great guitarist who can play about any style,<br />he plays totally different when he isn't playing in rob zombies band or the manson days!<br />in the country realm he would make brad paisley look sick!!!!!
B00E1L9N8E|2.0|I have this a rating of a 2 instead of a 1 simply for the fact that the filming and locations were beautiful.  I didn't rent this but actually bought it without seeing it first because I was so convinced that it would be as amazing as the first. I was so disappointed. Leonardo and Toby did a great job. I hate the lead role female. The written character did not show the true shallowness of that part. Huge disappointment.  Possibly the thing that really made me sick was the musical score. It was horrible. It  was way too modern for such an old beautiful time.
0307891402|3.0|was purchased as a gift, so I don't know how much the person really likes it'.<br />so I can't honestly rate this item! sorry!!!!!
B00CATONCA|4.0|This was exactly as advertised, only complaint is that the lights are not very bright and the power button is kinda sticky.  Special features and extended episodes add a lot of additional content.  If you are a big Walking Dead fan this is definitely a BUY!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|If you read the book and have that background knowledge this is an excellent movie! Otherwise you may be a little lost at times!
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|The ordered DVD is exactly what I needed as a replacement for a lost Dvd.  Thank you so much.  Its perfect.
B00AL1P9PY|5.0|Old time Rush! Magical story telling...great anti-communism theme. Too bad it never got any air time due to the length of the songs. The percussion work is absolutely breathtaking.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Its perfect.  I needed a replacement disc for a misplaced one.  Its exactly what I thought it would be and a came in a timely manner and was in extremely good condition.
023076651X|5.0|One the the most influential business books I've read to date. I recommended it to anyone who has ever felt the desire to start something but didn't think they were ready.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I found the subject matter interesting and somewhat new to me.  I knew that there wasn't much that was fact in the bible, I just wasn't sure what was true.  The author's premise is that the real, true, historical Jesus is every bit as impressive as Jesus the mythologized Christ.  However, the details of the book don't support his thesis.<br />I'm grateful that someone who has fully delved (20+ years of study) into what's knowable was willing to share his knowledge with the masses.  I just wished he would have told it more compellingly.
B000002G9S|5.0|Bad Co has the same guys in the group.  This group was from the 60-70's.  I love them and their music
B008Y212PI|5.0|really like this tipe of game. The artist in me get to make pictures in a way but it also lets me firure out the right patterns to get it solve.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I have read many of John Grisham books and I have never been dissapointed. In Litigators, Grisham tells a story which is completely<br />believeable in today's ambulance chasers rush to sue the big drug manufacturers
B000QCQ8XA|4.0|Loved this book. I really enjoy the way he writes; funny and touching at the same time. All his work is enjoyable.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Lorde has redefined pop. The whole album is full of meaningful lyrics about growing up, normal life, and making fun of mainstream music. Which ironically has made her reach number one on iTunes. I love every song on the album. I was first stuck on \\"Royals\\" because of the beautiful harmonies and amazing bass empowered background beat, only to find that nearly every song is just as catchy and perfect as that song. Not to say that there are any bad songs, but maybe 1 or 2 songs are great, but not up too par with Royals. All that said though I think it is an album anyone will enjoy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|My buses keep getting stuck at the shopping mall though and I can't figure out how to keep them moving.  Other than that though it's a lot of fun.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Love the Doc.!! Just started watching the Doctor. Fell in love with him like all the others!<br />He Is wonderful!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is free, well when I bought it, and its a nice app with tons to do and little advertisement.  Great hidden object game.
B008JFUP0I|3.0|This so funny to me. Why in England Fast 6 was releases early last month.  What is wrong with these bloody studios for them to release the title in the country where it was produce so late. I bought it from Amazon UK. It was region free too. Also I have to mention it cost me only $ 22.50 with shipping from uk. That was gala. I love the Fast And Furious line-up. But not so much the Two witout it's original cast. To date my favorite is \\"Fast Five \\".  It is only my opinion, to my self. Movie I gave it a 3.5 Stars as too much of night shooting and it did took a way the fun a bit. Still love it.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Huge Star Trek fan, I just don't like that it is remastered.<br />Working my way through all of the series, and Amazon Prime is the best deal ever because I get to watch all of it for free.
B001VU1NJ0|4.0|I had not read anything about the film and the title was enticing. However, the story not a  happy one, although it seemed to me to be what might have happened in reality. The acting was excellent and the plot carried out honestly. I would recommend it to a friend.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Gripping story of a murdered child in a small, English coastal town. Nearly everyone is suspect, in the manner of an Agatha Christie. The mystery never lags, the performances of this character-driven drama are stellar (although I could have used subtitles) and the ending is both devastating and moving. Highly recommended.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|I was charged for buying it but they never downloaded it to my Kindle. I don't appreciate paying for something then not get it.
B00F96P8S4|5.0|Beening a fan of Cher I love all that she does.  She amazes me on how she gets better with each project.  This CD offers a song for every mood, situation and moment.  Women's World is even better than it was life on &#34;The Voice&#34;.  I &#34;Hope you find it&#34; as great and awesome as I did;  you will not be disappointed.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This is an awesome sea-going adventure movie.  My sister was squeamish about the boy getting his arm amputated but the scene is not graphic, it didn't bother me.  So, I guess be advised if you're watching it with little kids although I do recommend this movie for the whole family.  The only thing I'm disappointed about is that there's no sequel and it doesn't look like there ever will be.  I give it 5 stars, easy.
159420411X|3.0|The author chose some applications that may have been of interest to others, but not me.  I didn't read much of it, and donated it to my local public library.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think. I love it. I would recommend this game to any one who likes to solve puzzles.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found that I actually couldn't put this book down. It made me late to a couple things in had going on for that reason! LOL. great writing and I shockingly related to almost each character in the book.
B002TVQ4AS|4.0|I liked the songs, the interviews, the background.  Excellent work and great idea to preserve Cuban music and recognize good musicians.
140006922X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very interesting and I would recommend it to my friends. It is an interesting way to look at the life and times of Jesus. It really put his life and actions into perspective. I have a whole new respect for him and a rebel and human being.
1476727651|3.0|It's understandable that Mr. King had a great deal of trepidation about writing a sequel to one of his most popular books. 'The Shining' was a claustrophobic horror book which kept the readers on the edge of their seat the further they got into the story. Because of the author's two previous works (Carrie, Salem's Lot,) it wasn't a sure thing that the Torrance family was going to survive the Overlook Hotel. It was easy for the reader to place themselves in the family's situation and freak out to the point of puckering their sphincter muscle to a 10.0 on the ole rump scale. I didn't envy Mr. King trying to top, let alone meet, the quality of 'The Shining.'<br /><br />'Doctor Sleep' started off great. Burdened with not only having the shine but also dealing with the mental trauma of surviving the Overlook Hotel, Dan Torrance very believably falls into alcoholism. I was rooting for the guy being able to eventually get his act together and having a decent life. Mr. King has proved, time and again, that his protagonist(s) may not necessarily get a happy ending. Midway through the book, it evolved from a heart-wrenching Dan Torrance odyssey into something almost mundane. The 13-year-old heroine, Abra, has such a powerful shine that the True Knot antagonists, who have abducted, tortured and murdered young children for hundreds of years, don't ever seem very threatening. Sure, the True Knot gypsies would be terrifying to your average everyday Joe, but Abra is like the kid, Charlie, from Mr. King's novel 'Firestarter.' She packs such a serious punch, you start feeling bad for the evil True Knot lot.<br /><br />If you are inclined to pick up 'Doctor Sleep,' I strongly suggest you first read 'The Shining' or you will miss out on a lot of important back story. The novel is okay, but nowhere near as suspenseful as its predecessor.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I'm eagerly awaiting a time when people outside of the USA can purchase MP3 albums online without having to buy the physical cd.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|The story of Tess is so sad!  I enjoyed watching this and thought the acting, scenery and dialogue all worth watching.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I don't normally like games with &quot;buttons&quot;, but this one is both fun and challenging!  I love the look on Granny's face when she falls, but like a senior citizen with lots of spunk, soon she's up and running again.<br /><br />The levels I've played so far are not so difficult that I become frustrated, but are definitely able to be overcome with a little practice.<br /><br />This game works on my Kindle Fire with no problems at all.  And today, the game is a bargain!

B005DF2QMC|3.0|I checked if all the parts were there. I did not start using it yet. It was delivered or shipped very quickly to my door. it seems to me that this is a good item to have though. I could have bought this many years ago. Thank you. Goodbye.
B008JFUO72|4.0|It was bought for my wife's birthday she loves Iron Man Movies. The Kids Loved it too. They all appreciated the bonus rental.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the book immensely. I felt the author used a thesaurus way too much while writing the book, but it is a quick read.  It is thought provoking and interesting.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|One of the best series I have watched.  Great acting. Keeps you guessing until the end of the show and adds more information with each episode.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Quite different than other &#34;lawyer&#34; shows.  Very witty.  The characters are interesting.  The cases are thought provoking.  Just really great entertainment.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Great book!  the language is more than I'd like but it's part of the jadedness of the main character.  Chris tells a great story in a very creative way.  the main character, Carson, spends all his time & energy focused on getting out of the small town of Clover, & his best friend, Malorie, Spends all her energy creating memories of clover - Carson does grow throughout the book, I guess not as much as some reviewers want, but I think it's realistic,  The movie is awsome & the audio book Is So worth getting. Chris is incredibly talented, listening to him read his books with all the different voices he uses is a real treat.
1603425381|5.0|Absolutely terrific addition to my library of crochet items. I have used different borders for scarfs, pot holders, towels, etc which added a special finishing touch to gifts. Clear instructions, diagrams and photos.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|This book is intense in the fact that it's full of live changing and life saving information. I highly recommend everyone to read it and have this knowledge. In this day of horrible eating habits and unhealthy diet choices, the information here can change your life for the better! What's better than living a healthy long life?
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|Much better than the regular Kindle calendar app which doesn't sync at all. Give it a minute and it'll sync up.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|It's quick, easy to learn and a straightforward version of the game. It's very professionally done. It was quite the bargain when it was offered as the free app of the day.
B00E0PT0FC|5.0|They are an unbeatable combination. This is a great recording, very different from Dave's recent work. Brings me back to the Extensions album which is one of my all time favorite Dave Holland records. Thanks Dave!
B000YABS8E|5.0|So cute, so naive, so sweet. I love Brendan Fraser - his boyish charm (especially in this movie) warms my heart. Fun movie to watch, lots of fun actors in this movie - unexpected role for Christopher Walken. Just love it.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I had to watch it two times after I watched it  I loved it to go out and buy it
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Yeah, maybe we know how the story and how it all turned out, but this was the most suspenseful slow-movie I have ever seen. Not a lot of action, but with sooooo many things that could go wrong at every turn, it was an incredible story to see unfold.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I think that Prendergast is the most interesting character created in mystery writing since Sherlock Holmes.  He has many of the same characteristics that makes Holmes unforgettable, but he is more open to including others n his circle than Holmes.  If this is just a taste of what's to come, and I, for one, wish time would hurry.  I want more!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book was awesome. Took a little while for me to like it. Now on the third book.The Characters are all like you've known them forever.
B005PK57IK|5.0|What's not to like here?  Juliana M is cool and calm and Baranski is very cool and Josh Charles is charismatic/charming and capable and they all look and perform GOOD and the writing is snappy and the show always has little twists and turns and moves along very fast but you always catch up.  Whaddddddddddddddda ride, fun and colorful.  Kudos to the writers/producers/directors and all involved.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Picture of Dorian Gray is a complicated read but it goes quickly. It's lush imagery and rich psychological portraits are a real pleasure. It's often classed as a &#34;classic&#34; novel but, as Alan Moore recognized when he incorporated Dorian Gray into his &#34;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,&#34; both in style and content, this story has as much in common with early science fiction as it does with other Romantic novels. The only disadvantage of this free kindle copy is the lack of explanatory notes. The book is fraught with Greco -Roman literary allusions. Some of the allusions are very obscure but they are not mere ornament. In fact, the most obscure references are often the ones of greatest importance to the plot and themes of the work. The story is worth a read (or three!) but the this might not be the best copy for everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I never actually opened nor played the game.  I do not appreciate having to provide my birthdate to be able to play.  What is the rationale for this?  Isn't the year of my birth adequate?  With all the risks of identity theft, this really bugged me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101 games is great because of the variety of games it offers. It is simple enough to engage my son amd challenging enough to engage me.  Great game to take on a roadtrip!!!
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|This CD was not a very good CD. Kanye West needs to do much better than this. I really only enjoyed one of the songs on this album.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite CD by Zac Brown Band. There isn't a song on the CD that I don't like. It has a different feel than The Foundation as well as Uncaged, but I for me I love it as much as The Foundation. I also appreciate that Zac Brown Band is talented enough to give each CD a bit of a different feel. It's still their amazing music, but there is something unique to each album. I'd highly recommend this CD to anyone. There are very few albums out there that I like EVERY SONG. TOTALLY WORTH THE LISTENING EXPERIENCE.
014050639X|5.0|This is my favorite childens' book!  I read it to my daughter and am now reading it to my grandchildren!  The little ones love the sing-song rhymes, and everyone has fun trying to find the characters in the illustrations.  The illustrations are detailed with a lot of fun things to spy.  I give this book to everyone having a baby--it's just so sweet and fun!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Very surprised by the ending! Did not see that coming! Hoping there is a second season, a lot of possibilities for answers regarding the main characters.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Great season of the dead. Zombies' heads are getting really squishy and bloody. The governor is a great creepy guy to hate!
B005DC68NI|5.0|This was a great read with loads of links, advice, and how-to's. I highly recommend it to anyone considering self-publishing
B002M9WW30|5.0|It's Rocky, on Blu Ray. Really what more do you need besides something to watch it on and with? Besides the films themselves I am very pleased with packaging size for a 6 disk set.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I have owned Seiko 5 watches in the past and always liked them.  I bought this one mostly because of the color.  It coordinates with my khaki shorts and tan clothes well. It is very comfortable and a little smaller than most of my other watches.  It looks even better in person!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was recommended to me by my Granddaughter.It gives us a chance to discuss living.Which is also about dying. BEING A CANCER SURVIVOR there is such truth in this book.It may be fiction but could be a true story.Great book
B009CFYRCG|5.0|This movie is my absolute favorite movie of all time.  It is a movie you either &#34;get it&#34; or you don't.... there is no in between. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are pure genius.  Their chemistry is incredible, and their characters are so totally believable.<br />If you have twisted sense of humor, you will probably enjoy this movie...especially if you love Coen brothers movies.
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|Now here near the fun of the previous Birds  Slow  just not good<br /><br />I am told I need more words to complete this  Okay there
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|A few minor issues as people mentioned before: being able to drop the weights into the body of the mouse, but other than that I'm happy.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great read, as usual. Grisham, above all else, is consistent. I've read nearly all of his books and this one is as good as the rest.
B003RV43X4|5.0|I got this movie because I enjoyed the first one so much and the remake was just as good to watch.

B001BJNIIK|5.0|I enjoyed the action and the drama that this movie contains. Got it so that I can watch it when I want.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This will not work with your windows phone or windows RT tablet. You should also not let it connect to the internet so you can flash (hack) it.
0316044695|5.0|Amazing story! What a courageous group of men who put their lives on the line so we don't have to.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This software is thought very good. I've tried the English version and it helps me to remind and learn new words and forms.<br /><br />You start from the basis and grow with small block of information at a time.<br /><br />Very good software.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|Super Heroes should be special, Iron Man should be special, Iron Man 3 was not special.<br />I think Tony Stark should be the one in the suit, not Rhodes as the War Machine, not the evil Savin, or the President as a hostage. I did like the suit flying to Tony in pieces and I did like Pepper in the suit and the story line with the kid and Tony's New York induced PTSD anxiety. I watched it from a 3D disc and that OK too, but the 3D previews of Thor's Dark World looked better.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This program is well programmed.<br />With a lot of options. You can choose sub-frequencies to help you to improve your relaxation or your attention.<br /><br />Could be grater to insert a sort of casuality in sound...
B003U53GK8|5.0|This was a great show and the quality of the streaming was pretty good once I upgraded my internet speed.
0500289077|5.0|Source of inspiration for me with some of the greats inside as content. Wish I got the hardcover though. Very flimsy
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Time Killer by Todd Thiede is an edgy, chilling thriller.<br /><br />Main characters are a detective and his new, female partner. Characters have a great chemistry, and it's fun to read the tension that builds up (and sometimes explodes) between them.<br /><br />Highly recommended crime drama, but it today.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|5 stars whennu can access all the cool extras through normal gameplay. prettyncool game though.not bad for a kindle fire game.
B0099HUB8Q|5.0|A beautul read, a top writer, thank goodness you have these magnificent books now listed.Cant wait for my next Herriot book.
B00D6DVSAE|1.0|If you're looking for a new Sting album -based on his past -you're out of luck!!!<br />My fault that I didn't research this release -I guess...<br />His fault for putting his name first, this isn't The Sting I've come to know & love.<br />Oh well... my loss<br />Don't let it be yours...<br />One last thing -Sting's brogue accent just doesn't cut it
B004W1GCNC|4.0|The first 3 episodes were great and much drama in each.  However, Season 1 is missing the last 3 episodes!
B005IQZB14|5.0|an amazing journey beautifully told. i did not want it to end. A lesson in courage, to do what you think you can't. Brava, Cheryl Strayed
B007CFL4WO|5.0|Needed this book for one of my classes, and needed it in a hurry. Got it when expected and for a great price.
0446310786|5.0|Needed this book for one of my classes, and needed it in a hurry. Got it when expected and for a great price.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|SO EASY TO USE AND DOWN LOAD, MY 7yr OLD GRANDDAUGHTER HAD DOWNLOADED A GAME BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO PASSWORD PROTECT IT. I HAD TO GET HER ONE AS SHE KEPT PINCHING MINE, AND I COULDN'T USE IT AT ALL
B000VSAEYI|5.0|The kids I bought it for really enjoy it especially the two seep rate pools and you can keep it shallow. The only part I say is hard is blowing up the different a parts and breaking it down. But other than that love it.
B0060CREHO|5.0|My four year old daughter giggled her way through this movie!  Loved it and kept her occupied for a portion of a long road trip.  Such a classic.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I became very confused by her characters. Went back to some of the reviews. Realized it was nto just me and deleted the book.
0060507772|5.0|This was a gift for my adult daughter who is a big Pratchett fan.  The book is beautiful and we are both really pleased with it.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Very suspenseful! I absolutely loved and need more Revenge! Can't wait until season 3 is available for purchase. Must buy
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a Great comparison to the books! While I was watching it, I kept questioning if I've seen it before. ;)
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I love this series. This is the third or fourth time through for me. The characters of John Shepherd, Tayla, Dr Weir, Ronan and Dr. Becket and Dr McKay are unforgettable. It is a wonderful space fantasy. Whenever I want to escape into another world I go to Stargate Atlantis. I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English. The SG-1 series is good too and was the beginning of the Stargate series. In the beginning of Stargate Atlantis Jack O'Neil passes the torch to John Shepherd. Very cool indeed.
B009JZORSI|5.0|Loved it! I'm a huge Star Trek fan and this proved the franchise is still going strong!! I LOVE SPOCK!!!
1609611543|5.0|This book was a bit technical in places, but brought to light startling facts about why we have the fat epidemic in America.  We have changed our diet and recommended the book to several people.  Great recipes too!
B00003CXAR|5.0|great picture quality also a good addition to anyone's collection. Great price for the DVD would suggest to anyone for a copy
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Great game, it can keep you occupied for hours. Only bad thing is sometimes spidey doesn't do what you want, other wise it's fun.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was even better than the first book. Never a dull moment. I recommend it to everyone that loves magic, love, and suspense.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|This is a very mild series.  There might have been more punch to it, but, I am still seeing it.  Have decided that I do like &#34;Brendan Coyle&#34;.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great color and images.  Story was enjoyable.  Adult funny and child acceptable. I enjoyed the characters and the story. Great flick.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It was everything that I wanted and was the perfect match! It arrived quickly and surpassed all my needs. It was perfect!
B00003CXAW|5.0|This was a great purchase!  I also really enjoyed the seperate disk explaining the creative makings behind the movie. It gave more insight to the story.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|It was everything that I wanted and was the perfect match! It arrived quickly and surpassed all my needs. It was perfect!
0143036424|1.0|I requested a &#34;Large Print&#34; copy and did not receive a &#34;Large Print&#34; copy, so I gave the book away.  Very disappointing.
B00AL1P9PY|5.0|cant explain the greatness within this album....i was at Karen V's house in JR High...it was her brothers album...i was and still am HOOKED!
B00FEN000S|5.0|It Has Alot Of Action In It :) It Is A Good Movie And I Would Tell Everyone To Watch It
B004SDEP38|1.0|I got this for my kindle, thinking it would help me post things on a website that is for writers (it's legal). But when I go to just make a new document, it says that I have to buy the updated version, which 14 dollars! It's not worth my time.
B00756GRUE|5.0|Stylish and substantial and solar powered, this Seiko Dive Chronograph meets my professional needs , working in ,both, TV studios and Classrooms, and does it with a contemporary and masculine look. It's a heavy watch (and big enough to be seen from the International  Space  Station :)<br />So far, a few weeks in. I really like it!!!:)
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|My son and daughter saw The Croods in the theater, and they loved the movie. Since it came out on DVD and Blue-ray we, have watched it quite a few times. It is a good movie for the whole family. Recommend anyone to watch The Croods.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a very interesting book. Had to be patient while the story built and then I couldn't put it down!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it has more interesting stuff lol and you can sleep and there is more mods which are monsters that's why I rate it 5 stars lol lol lol. woooooohoooohoooowooo
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Yes the game is excellent. It's been out there for who know how long. I know amazon wants you to write at least a min of 20 words, but you don't have to take it to the max and write a thesis about it. No body cares about your reviewing ability. All any body cares is was the app buggy or came up with something bad.<br />If the app asks for a permission that you don't agree with you, just move on; you don't have to be the hero to risk yourself and install the app so you can tell the world. And yes reviews are meant to be one paragraph long regardless of the topic. No need to conclude it. Quit embarrassing yourselves.. Gotta love that reviewer who even leaves their email and where he works at.. No one cares!!<br />I hope this review helps those who waste 3 hours a day writing FAOTD reviews instead of doing something more useful.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I have been playing this game for weeks now.<br /><br />I am doing pretty good except for getting the animals with acorns because you don't get that many. Now I got download some update and if any play anymore till I do so and its not springtime now but can't wait to get back to playing this game
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun, fast paced, well written romance.  Highly recommended.<br />I'm looking forward to reading more works from Mira Lyn Kelly in the future.
B000QEIOTO|1.0|I have to have a Samsung tv as well as a Samsung player and I do not have a Samsung tv
B001BANK32|4.0|I read this years ago, but because of the upcoming sequel I wanted a refresher.  I can't believe all the things I forgot over the years.  It was well worth the re-read.
B0035W8QUQ|5.0|First heard this on an Air France flight home last May.  I enjoyed it so much that I played it several times, (could it have been the wine?!).  The second thing that I did the following day after sorting through bills, was to order Via Crucis, which has been a regular among my favorites.  I find it calming, meditatively inspiring, uplifting despite its title and subject matter.  Highly recommend.
6305428271|5.0|Quick delivery.  Excellent condition.  Acting, story plot, casting were all superb.  Exceeded expectations.  Language for adults but appropriate for story line.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Very different from the book, but that doesn't ruin it by any means.  I've only seen the unrated cut, so I can't compare it to the theatrical version.  This version is more \\"realistic\\" than many of the newer spate of zombie movies, in terms of the reactions of people and governments. And Brad Pitt, of whom I'm not a huge fan, carries the movie well.<br />Side note -- as a Whovian, it was a blast to see the next Dr. Who play a WHO doctor.  :-)
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Fast delivery.  I know this was an award winner and I admire the performance of Meryl Streep.  However, it was not what I expected and I was disappointed.  And I happen to be a huge Streep fan.  Had to watch it twice to make sure I was getting it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app has reduced the amount of junk running in the background slowing down my programs. It is easy to use and doesn't take long to run the cleaning program.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. It has nice big buttons and it saves the last calculation, which is perfect for working percentages.
B0042EJD8A|3.0|This wasn't a terribly \\"great\\" movie but it opened my eyes to a problem id isn't know existed.<br /><br />I think the follow up did a better job though making this version rather obsolete.
B006MBX90O|5.0|I am not a horror fan i didn't think this movie would be great, my hobby is writing stories I had a concept for a horror story and so I watch this series for inspiration and boy was I surprise, this series is mind blowing, ofcourse filled with fan service(by that i mean the hot maid and sexual scenes) which made me watch through the first few episodes that didn't had much spark in them, after those episodes everything was just so immersive i cant help but play the next episode! i wish we could see more of the murder house.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|tiny tiny but at least we paid $35 with free shipping and the kids absolutely love it!! My 10 year old got it as a birthday present
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi was a fascinating and fantastic book. I read it in just under two weeks and loved absolutely every part and every minute of it. At points I can have mixed emotions about the book so let's take a look at each part of the book.  There are many things I like and dislike about Part 1. I especially like all the stories from Pi's childhood such as the creation of his nickname and the goat lesson his dad taught him. These parts are gripping to me as a reader and I am drawn in by these parts. Parts in which they talked about religion, animals, or life morals bored me to death. I found those parts pretty dull.  Out of the three parts part two was easily my favorite. I loved all the action, suspense, and drama in part two.  Pi's boat to Canada sinks and he's separated from his family. Pi finds himself on small life boat out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with a zebra, orangutan, hyena, and most importantly a tiger named Richard Parker. Soon the other animals die and Pi is left alone on the boat with the tiger. The book from there is an arduous struggle for survival as Pi and Richard Parker must learn to live together. I love all these different adventures such as the flying fish, the encounter with the blind man, and the secret island. The ending to part two makes me cry as Richard Parker never looks back. In part three I love how Pi makes up the two stories and forms connections and I absolutely am fascinated how the company prints the true story in their paper. Overall I loved reading this book and enjoyed every moment of it. What I will take away from it are the interesting (yet boring) morals about god. This story truly made me believe in god. I don't feel like this is just another fairy tale story but with the great first person the author uses the story really comes to life in my head. Overall I truly did enjoy this book and would highly recommend you read it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the book. It will make a great movie. Sitting on the edge of my seat through the whole thing.
0439023513|3.0|As I read this, I wondered just how much time Suzanne Collins spends thinking up gruesome ways to kill off her characters. Seriously, I don't think a single person dies the same way in all three books. And there's a lot of dying. In all three books.<br /><br />Like the first two books in the series, this was a gripping read. Refreshingly, unlike the previous books, there was a solid conclusion. But it just wasn't... satisfying. Maybe it was because the political climate still didn't feel great. Maybe because the main characters who remained were pretty messed up. Whatever the reason, I still was kinda depressed after finishing it.<br /><br />Also, I hated that the author wrote the series in present tense--it made the delivery seem awkward and distracted me frequently.<br /><br />In summary: riveting book, strong characters, some gore, a bit of a downer.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|love the story. I wished it would go on and on. such a reveal at the end.<br /><br />cant wait for the sequel
B0083Z614S|5.0|Love this book but has a bad word so don't let kids under 10 read it. Still if I could, I'd give it a 100 star rating.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Awesome JJ Abrams as always.  New  cast is fantastic.  Video stream was excellent and a high quality as always.  Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it like$$$$$$$$$$$ this game is off the money cool and that was double o dollar sine sineing off the hook!!!!!!!!!!
B000WJSCZE|5.0|an excellent, must-have book for every presenter & public speaker! ;))<br />If I only bought one book on presenting- it would be this one!
B00005JO20|5.0|This version is everything the 1933 version aspired to be and then some!  The 1933 film is still one of my favorite<br />films, despite the primitive technology, mostly because I knew most of the cast.  If you like the story, you'll like this version. Just relax and enjoy it for what it is:  the movie you wanted to see in 1933 as it was envisioned by the<br />early filmakers.  Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|VERY pleased with this series!<br />Gripping, jarring, sad, encouraging and enjoyable. Can't wait for the movies to cone out. Awesome!
B002RI9UBS|3.0|Not quite realistic but not quite fantasy - the book just missed the mark on both accounts.  An interesting twist at the end earned it an extra star.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Well acted and written with engaging ensemble of characters. Interesting arc for the lead character as she becomes more invested at the law firm. Argumentation during trials is fun to watch. Two well acted and written support characters, one an investigator and the other a quirky savant lawyer, make this a promising vehicle for spinoffs.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This continuing saga once again showcases the authors ability to intertwine a myriad of characters into a cohesive relationship.  Can't wait for the final installment.
086571701X|5.0|Two thumbs up, wordy but a lot of people like this still of reading.  Reviews different types of set ups that are available.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great app for all of the puzzle fans out there. It starts with easy ones to get you started then slowly they get more challenging.  I'm addicted. It is a good FAOTD.
B006DX4PXQ|1.0|It is my fault, but I apparently ordered this movie in the Italian version and it will not play on my DVD player.  How stupid could I get.  It did not come with a return mail label and it came from overseas, so I ate the cost and will avoid ordering movies in the future.  My fault entirely, but I was confused by what seemed to be various versions of the same movie..
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Really liked this one. I find myself reviewing books that I don't care too much about and just decided that I would post on a book that I felt was very good.<br /><br />I usually avoid the teen phenom's type fantasy that most are enamored with. Trained and served with a lot of 18+ young men for 35 yrs and now I have a 14 yr old myself. The 'coming of age' type are more than fantasy, more like pre-teen fairy tales. Credibility, realism, character ... Argh! Could go on, just making point that typical fantasies miss my radar.<br /><br />This one did cover the MC's younger yrs but it was done very well. It does a great job in character development and has a spin with plot. I can take a bit of magic but don't drown me with it. There was magic but did not detract in the slightest. I was interested through out.<br /><br />Only reason I never reviewed was that so many have commented on it and feel many do a better job than myself. I'm just seconding the overall consensus. Great character, good story,plot and remained credible, realistic throughout.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Powerful and the timeline of world events were awsome.  Didn't think this series would hold my attention but very well written and acted
1476727651|2.0|I bought this book because Mr. King's books are usually pretty good. But I have found out, with time, that his books that were written early in his career were wonderful, scary, thought-provoking, interesting. This book is not, really. I read the whole book.; and it seemed as if the author was trying to stretch the story from the facts of Danny Torrence's history and present life. The book had lots of 'filler'. This could have been much better, ESP. From a great writer as Mr. King.<br />Disappointed. It was a mish-mosh of characters that no one really cared about--with exception of the little girl.<br />Is Mr. King running out of ideas for good books? Sorry to be harsh, but its my honest opinion .<br />Hopefully, he will come up with some original ideas, not sequels from other books.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A lot of fun! The pop culture references are fun, but even if you don't get them this is a fast paced, exciting read!
1577314808|5.0|In a modern style Tolle echoes de Caussade in recommending surrender to the moment.  He says,  \\"True surrender . . . does not mean to passively put up with whatever situation you find yourself in and to do nothing about it.  Nor does it mean to cease making plans or initiating positive action.  Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life. . . . It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is.\\"  Tolle offers secular language in explaining dynamics often discussed in Buddhist and Christian contexts.  He writes in such a way as to create an Aha! in the reader which allows the experience of the awe that Paul Tillich called \\"the eternal now.\\"
B008JFUO4U|5.0|We have watched several times.  Truly a movie that justifies buying blue-ray.  Intriguing plot, We didn't see that one coming.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Probably one of the best there is, has multiple ways to make sure you get out of bed and offers multiple levels of difficulty in disarming the alarm.<br /><br />One way or the other this will wake you up!<br /><br />Docking one star due to the developer not adhering to the holo interface - the UI could definitely be better!!
0575089938|5.0|The book had it own merits.  It was not flat, but just as interesting as the first book was.  Again it had a suprise ending.  I loved it as much as the first book and look forward eagerly to the third book of the series.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This a slick app for my Kindle Fire HD.  I have collected quite a few PDF books and this app works great for those and certain magazines that I subscribe to, electronically.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I just loved Iron Man the whole family just can't stop watching! !!!!!!!!!! He better be in avengers that's all I'm saying.
0879309210|4.0|This book is full of detailed explanations on how to setup and repair just about anything related to guitars.  It is not a book for light reading, but a fact filled, detailed book that will walk you through just about any process that deals with guitar repair for acoustic or electric guitars.  Dan Erlewine's depth and breadth of knowledge is nothing short of amazing.  IF you want to fix a guitar, or just tune up yours to play the best it can, this is the book!
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Amazing amazing amazing!!! Doesn't get any better than this. No one puts on a show like this woman. Highly recommended.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book describes the unknown mystery in life, it holds an amazing story that I want to share with the world.It inspires me to do great things. But the real message this book holds is that there is no perfect world that can be made, you make your own perfect world that you shape and shift, untill you are satisfied with what you've created. I am amazed that someone could write such a passionate book,I am quite the fan of it.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!!  It will not sync to my Kindle after installing the free app as directed.  Wasted an hour trying to load this and there is no way to get it on my kindle.  Amazon, you need to fix this as there is no way to demand a refund.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP, PERIOD!!!!!
1568363931|5.0|I got this from the library at first and loved it so much I had to buy my own. I'm using the Laptop Lunches Bento-Ware Bento Lunchbox and these recipes are a great start. Lots of good color photos, timelines, and variations to the recipes too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had  Learned the hard way to save all of the prizes that I was able to collect.  This game does consume alot of time
B0035HKWLW|4.0|We hadn't seen this for a while but saw it again with our 12 year old and it was pretty good.  It's a tad dated since it came out when the Swing Fad was huge but otherwise pretty funny.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This is my least favorite Grisham novel.  Definitely not a page-turner.  A huge plot development came out of nowhere and left me scratching my head for the last part of the book.<br /><br />Grisham jumps around from writing in the first person to the third person.  That is sloppy and lazy.
0231161166|4.0|Nessa Carey has accomplished the great task of translating a very technically challenging subject into an overall review of the revolution currently overtaking modern biology and evolution theory, based on very recent epigenetics research.  The book is very readable, and is written in the style of a mystery novel to keep the reader interested.  An inspired read of an important and evolving subject.  -  Tony Warren
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A little over a year ago my wife ask me to watch Downton Abbey with her. It sounded a little too dry for my taste. I tried watching for a few minutes and gave it up. For some reason I watched an entire episode later that season and I was hooked. I really enjoyed the characters, plots and sub-plots, scenery, settings and direction. I fell in love with it and starting ordering the seasons I had missed. Season two does not disappoint. Ed in Mystic, CT
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Every day the alarm resets to a default sound. I have constantly readjust it. Hopefully this info is useful to you all.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I am a long time fan of Star Trek. I watched it in the 70's. I wish there were more movies. The actors really favor their previous counterparts. I have recommended this to everyone. My younger sister is also a fan.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought two of these thinking it would be a nice way to stream web content on HD TV's.  Boy was I wrong.  Apparently unless you have high end PC/Tablet configurations, the image on the TV is at best 5 seconds behind the sending device, when it actually connects. And that's with the 5GB setting on the NETGEAR router.  Had another instance where the connection dropped out while the microwave was on (related/unrelated/coincidence? dunno;was able to replicate it on demand though).  Too bad, bought into the hype, very disappointed.  Sent them back for refund.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I really enjoy this game.  I have another Mahjong game which is a little more fun but this one still gets repeated visits by me.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|I love the iron man saga. This movie has intense action and I like how it gives a nod to avengers. Love it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoy this game but it's a little confusing to me as I do not gamble and there is more than just bingo.  I would rather have a game with Bingo all by itself.
B00005JLO2|1.0|There have been several remakes of the book, including a well-done version with Laurance Harvey called \\"Storm Over the Nile.\\"  While the other remakes stay close to the book, this one is revisionist and strays fairly far.  The basic message is bog-standard revisionism: the Brits are horrible, and their Christianity was, as someone put it, \\"the British Empire at prayer.\\"<br /><br />The movie loses focus often and the beginning (prior to Ledger's receiving the feathers) is very slow paced, with a number of unnecessary scenes, that look nice (great costumes), but do not further the story.  There is necessarily, confusion about the events as this version does not follow the River War, ten years+ after the death of Gordon, but follows the lethargic British attempt to rescue Gordon (who spent years in Sudan attempting to eliminate the slave trade).<br /><br />Apart from the emotional confusion caused by 1) an attempt to show a Brit as a hero, and 2) the unhistoric revisionist attitude, there is a lot of good photography and rip-roaring battle scenes.  The action/adventure quota is as high as the faithfulness to the material is low.
B00C2C637I|5.0|I choose this book for our Halloween book club.  I enjoyed it a lot.  The character settings came alive and I think it was the perfect pick for this holiday.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Huge Drake fan, so I loveeeeeeeeee the album. My only problem is when it was delivered the case was a little cracked. The cd was in new condition, but I guess shipping must of got a little rough. I just didnt feel like going through the hassle of returning/exchanging it
B003KRLKHC|5.0|It is such a great movie...plus so easy to download onto your Kindle for long(ish) plane trips and view it at your leisure.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|Watched it on my Wii and it played really clear!! As far as the film --I was born in 88 so as a kid I never understood the movie, but I recently gave it watch for a class assignment and loveeeeeeeeeee this movie. So funny. I have always love Roberts.
0465043577|5.0|An amazing book about the affine fractality of time in Wall street. It is a very well explained book and should be read by anybody who wants to reeally understands or at least try how it really works.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Love the slider that lets you set the opponent difficulty. Hours of fun and great practice for the experienced. Great learning tool for the beginner.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Cloud Atlas is an absolute work of art. I found this book to be a breath of fresh air, the narrative style was truly enjoyable. What is remarkable about this book is the transition between the stories, from classic literature, to thriller, to comedy, to sci-fi, to post apocalyptic nightmare Cloud Atlas has it all. The way Mitchell changes the style of writing to suit the story keeps the reader alert and fits so beautifully. The range that this book demonstrates is incredible. Each of the characters is fully realized and the links between the stories are subtle and not over done.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas may not be for everyone, but it is worth a shot because you might just surprise yourself.
B00633W614|5.0|Looking forward to starting book 3. Great ending to draw you into the next book. The characters have become real for me. I want to see them in their lives as they grow into the next stage of life.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|This was just what I needed; all the truth, humor, passion, everything! I felt like I was there with Liz, in every bite of pasta, in every mantra and prayer in the Indian Ashram, and in every friendship made in Bali. I'm renting the movie as we speak, just because I can't get enough!<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert

0240810961|5.0|I'm primarily an illustrator/ fine artist, but I was looking how to add more \\"life\\" into my style. This is actually a great book and it's written in a friendly way. There's not a lot of confusing jargon. I was tired of reading books about measuring and trying to achieve an exact likeliness by copying what you see. That type of approach to art just felt really empty. This book helps a lot with the art of sketching, which is something I think helps all artists. It focuses a lot on kinetics and communication, which is the heart of animation. I like how it doesn't teach you to mindlessly copy what you see. I believe the techniques and philosophy will help me breathe more life into my art, which is what I ultimately want to achieve. A sketcher's bible!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent! Every enterprenourser and manager must read it. Also it's very nice for people who like tech, because it has a lot of the history of how began the computer industry.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I'd like to give this 5 stars because I LOVE this game!! While it's a fun game, it freezes or disconnects at least once a day. I'm also taking away a star because the kindle version inverts itself and when you flip it around, it flips itself upside down again. I then I have to uninstall and download it again. But seriously...very addictive.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I chose this rating as Hosseini has already proved himself to be an insightful, caring writer in his previous books. _ECHOED becomes a bit muddled by the shifting timelines of several generations of different families whose lives are impacted by a previous generation of another family.<br /><br />It is worth the time to go back in the book to refresh one's memory if the reader is unclear as to who was in a previous generation and how his life events impact the character about whom one is reading.<br /><br />If one likes Hosseni, this book will be another excellent encounter with the author's work.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have been waiting awhile for Gone Girl to come out in paperback so I could read it.  My expectations were high based on the reviews from friends and online.  The book has some good twists and definitely kept me interested, but I was very disappointed with the ending.  I would give it a shot if you are looking for a dark and twisty book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games is a concept that is difficult to understand. Reading the trilogy helped a lot. Very good reading.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was great to begin with but then all of the sudden you couldn't do much with out spending real money, or posting your intent for others to provide for you. My Money is for my real world family and life not a stupid game!!!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book had a slow start but was really great through the bulk of it. I loved the twists and turns. I loved to HATE Amy. But what I really hated... I hated, hated, hated, HATED the ending!!! That ended worse than any book I've ever read! Grrrrrrrr! Can I write a new ending for it?
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was really excited to receive the Chromecast. Setup was a snap, but when I tried streaming, it just wouldn't work. Both YouTube and Netflix streaming to the Chromecast didn't work. I tried calling support, but the only troubleshooting suggestions were items I tied prior to calling support (reboots, setup again, try streaming from another device). Phone support put me in contact with email support,which was even worse. Turnaround time on email support was a couple days per email, with Q&A already performed with phone support. Great idea, but poor execution. The rating is one star (great setup, streaming wouldn't work, poor support). I returned the Chromecast.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the book all together  because it has a lot of cliff hangers and this is my kinda book!!loved it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|If you want to play REAL minecraft you need to play xbox or Pc version since pe doesn't have as much things.  Pe version is still fun but not as fun as Pc or xbox as I've said already.  If you're going to buy pe than l recomend that you wait for a few further updates to come out.
B004KD5TQI|4.0|Great CD!  Cool compilation of songs and artists. An eclectic selection of music genres. If you liked the movie you'll like this soundtrack.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game was really good at first but after a while it just got really boring and slow. other than that it was an amazing game.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Wonderful acting and character development.  Really digs into how a tragedy can cause people to turn on each other instead of coming together.  Everybody has his or her own agenda and secrets in this story and the story's tension comes from watching them weigh their worth against the greater objective of bringing a killer to justice.  The leads are all strong.  The pace is not as whizz-bang as we Americans are accustomed to.  You have to be patient and let the story unfold and the characters reveal themselves.  It's a very satisfying experience with a conclusion that does not aim to shock but rather to enlighten.  Very moving.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I bought this to take underwater photos while snorkeling in Maui.  It did keep my iPhone dry but would not take pics. I tried letting air into the case but pressure wasn't the issue. All of the out of water photos were fine. Charging the phone with the case on was very difficult as it was a tight fit.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Well worth the $0 (FAOTD).  But seriously if you didn't get the free download is still wroth the 99 cents

1451695195|3.0|This book will support those who believe in religious experiences while in a coma and will not change the mind of the non-believer. I believe in a higher power, but the physician in me does not understand why Dr. Alexander does not address temporal lobe seizures which can produce ecstatic meetings with God and visits to heaven. According to Dr. Oliver Sacks's  new book \\"Hallucinations\\", ecstatic-religious seizures usually arise  in the right side of the temporal lobe. Ecstatic or religious or mystical seizures occur in only a small number of those who have temporal lobe epilepsy.<br />The ecstatic seizures may be associated with personality changes, intense sprees of writing, pomposity, egotistic rambling, grandiosity, and claims of hearing God speak and speaking with angels. Sack's writes, \\" ecstatic seizures shake one's foundations of belief, one's world picture, even if one has previously been wholly indifferent to any thought of the transcendent or supernatural.\\" ( page 163). Dostoevsky had ecstatic auras in his later life. He also had an associated personality change between seizures. This is now called the Geschwind syndrome.<br />I do not doubt that he saw and heard what he describes. I do wonder about the explanations he offers. The part of the brain which takes in visual information in the retina but interprets the information of the rear (occiput) of the cortex can each have interruptions in\\"service\\". The same goes for the information taken in by the middle ear and interpreted by the inner ear and other parts of the cortex.<br />The book is interesting particularly because he is a practicing neurosurgeon. It is an easy read, in part because it rarely uses neuroanatomical terms or really describes how he eliminates explanations for what he experienced.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|Just good fun. Although if you don't watch the shadow it will drop outside of where you want it and count against you as a move. Still good fun.

0920668372|5.0|We never failed to shed a tear when we read this to our kids.  Hope our new nephew loves it too.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|I like this album much more than part 1 of 20/20 experience for several reasons:<br /><br />1. This album has much more energy than part 1.  I found part 1 to be somewhat long and boring after awhile and haven't really returned to that album except for a few choice cuts, including Suit and Tie.<br /><br />2. The music on this album seems more accessible.  There are nods to his first and second solo albums and the music seems instantly more catchy.  The opening track, the funky, \\"Gimme What I Don't Know\\" sets the tone with an 80's sound mixed with a \\"FutureLove\\" track.  The second single \\"TKO\\" strips that 80's sound and goes into the signature \\"FutureLove\\" \\"Timbaland\\" sound and reminds me of the \\"Cry me a River\\" sound.  \\"True Blood\\" is a great modern version of what Michael Jackson did with \\"Thriller\\" and includes Vincent Price type spoken vocals and creepy laughs and wolf howls.  For a nine minute track, I am surprised that I actually don't want to skip it.  Great fresh dance beat.  There's plenty more potential top singles on this album.<br /><br />3. There's less of that element, which was on the last album, where the song would essentially change mid-way through to a different tempo and almost a different song completely.  For instance, I preferred the second much shorter part of \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\" instead of the longer first part.  He's started this on FutureSex and I've noticed other artists do this too (Rihanna, Madonna, etc).
0399226907|5.0|We read this to our kids until the cover came off.  Bought this as a gift for a new nephew.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing. It is the perfect combination of funny and sad and has a good message for dads all over the world. It also teaches you good Christian morals for men and women. My brother watched this and loved it, and everyone I know who has watched it has loved it. It is for sure worth your time and money.
0307742539|4.0|The writing and translating continue to be very good, and the action kicks up a notch or two from Books 1 and 2, but the plot lines are more convoluted and thus less persuasive.  Still, all in all, the trilogy is deserving of much of the praise heaped upon it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing. The book follows a troubled teen named Charlie through his high school experiences with his friends Sam and Patrick. They go through the book surviving heartbreak, reject, and highschool.<br /><br />I recommend reading this book. This book is so real at depicting the high school experience and Chobosky writes so that teens can relate to the book on every level. The book has lessons and important teachings about life hidden within the hilarious, romantic, and tradjic pages.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite books I've ever read and everybody should read it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|David Lean is among my handful of favorite directors; I think his epics outshine everyone else's, and this is the best among them -- no offense to Bridge on the River Kwai and Dr. Zhivago.  I've probably seen it 25 times in the 50 years since it premiered, and I never tire of seeing it.  The wonderful performance Lean extracted from newcomer Peter O'Toole is amazing, and the great collection of supporting actors includes Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins and Anthony Quinn.  The Blu-Ray restored edition is stunning and includes several excellent extras.  Very Highly recommended.
1476727651|4.0|This was a good book. I liked The Shining and this follow up was well done. I agree with the reviewers who thought it reflected an older, more thoughtful author.I am sensitive to child abuse and this book did not go too far. If you like Stephen King, you will like this book.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|Winner of multiple Oscars, among them best picture, best director, best actor, Gandhi is indeed a very fine film.  Richard Attenborough may not be the equal of David Lean, but this is an extremely successful masterwork.  Ben Kingsley is great in the title role, and John Gielgud and Trevor Howard are among the fine cast.  As usual, the Blu-Ray surpasses all previous editions.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Lives up to the JJ Abrams hype.  Strong acting, great humor, killer plot.  Standard Star Trek.  Four more words required.
0307949486|5.0|This is the first and best volume of the celebrated recent trilogy from Sweden.  There are several interesting characters and intersecting plot lines in this multi-generational family saga.  Kudos to the translator for making it such a good read removed from its original language.
1451648537|4.0|Impresionante
0307949508|4.0|A bit of a let-down after the superior Book 1, but still quite a good read.  It's the same central family and many of the same characters, but some of the twists and turns of plot are rather hard to accept.  Again, it's well-written and expertly translated, but it just doesn't come up to the level established in Book 1.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Very well acted, kept me interested all the way. I recommend it to the fans of thrillers such as Wallander, The Killing, The Fall
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was good I will read it again and again this is the best book I have read I suggest the book to every one that would be good to read for every one else
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Well everyone told me that I HAVE to read this and  that it's Soooo good and that they cried so hard but it was weird I didn't cry and I found this book written a bit like a fan fiction from some random fan but it was good and quite sad.. I just didn't find it that sad, three stars John green, three stars.... This is just my opinion you don't have to agree with me you just have to accept that I am entitled to an opinion.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't believe Christian can cow to some upstart woman who dared to leave him but he did, and acceded to most of the demands made by Anastasia. Not only that Christian now has a phobia. What??? Yes the fear of Anastasia leaving him.<br /><br />This series is addictive, I don't wanna, but am loving it. We also get to meet some of the women that Christian has put under contract before. Well well well...
B000ZM1MG4|4.0|This movie is an old favorite classic hit favorite of mine. Had seen it before, but has been years since I saw it till rescently. Still love the movie. It has good humor and fun. I recommend it to everyone, young and old.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|If you are going to buy Elton's new album, treat yourself to the deluxe edition (available at Target) which has 3 additional songs, 2 of which I think are among the best on the album. These songs are his ode to love called \\"Candlelit Bedroom\\" and the other \\"Gauguin Gone Hollywood\\" is just a fabulous old-style Elton song in which he stretches the limits of his ripened voice to new heights. Wow! The third extra song \\"5th Avenue\\" is another beautiful song. My clear favorite on the album is \\"Oceans Away\\", a song written and dedicated by Bernie Taupin to his father, a war veteran. It is a beautiful song--maybe one of Elton's most beautiful songs--with heart-felt, emotional singing by Sir Elton. I have had the song in my head for several days now, humming it all over the place. As with any album, there are some songs that stand out and some which don't. In the case of The Diving Board, the ones that stand out, stand way out. The \\"New Fever Waltz\\" brings you to a world long ago and far away with another beautiful melody. \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" transports you to still another place in time as the music and words set the mood and the feelings. I could go on, but you get the point. I liked the album a lot for lots of reasons and I hope Elton continues to write and sing and tour--he's an iconic treasure who someday will be gone, so lets all appreciate him and enjoy his music while we're all still here. Thank you Elton.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this cause I just wanted another everyday watch I could wear that could keep good time. I went with Seiko cause I already have 4 of them, and all of them are amazing. Probably my favorite watch company that exists. Overall for the price this watch is awesome! and I love the fact that it's automatic and requires 0 batteries. Just Awesome for an everyday time piece!
0307271080|5.0|I felt this book gave a personal view and insights, that I could relate to and internalize,  of what it is like to come to the US as a young adult and figure out the culture here. Many of the things Adichie talks about I have heard from young people I know from Mali and Rwanda who have done just what the main character Ifemelu did - come to the US for college, look for work and find love along the way. For instance, their pronunciation and English grammar is always impeccable as is their dress. And why do Americans like sandwiches for lunch and not a hot meal. When my daughter came back from a summer living with a family abroad I asked what she learned. Her reply was that the way people do things can be not necessarily right or wrong but just different. Be happy with who you are. I feel this story carries this same message . On top of the cultural insights, the love story stirred my heart. I would like a sequel that takes place in 10 years.  It is an excellent read!
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|Excellent album, all the songs are memorable. My favorites are: Methademic, God is Dead, End of the Beginning, Damaged Soul, Naïveté in Black, Pariah and Dear Father. Well, and the others are very good too. You're not going to be disappointed to have this album. But try to buy this version, it has Naïveté in Black, which is a fast song with a powerful riffs, it must have been even in the basic album.
B003NS2T9G|3.0|There's a gruesome undertone to the imagined aliens and invaders that show up in every episode.  Scary, depressing and cheesy at the same time.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I spent an entire day reading &#34;Clash of Kings&#34; (COK), I could not put it down. The rising action is slowly building to (what I expect will be) an amazing climax, it makes me voracious for more! So much so that I'm half tempted not to continue reading for fear that I will have to wait too long for the sixth and seventh installments! My hope is that Daenerys will totally come into her own!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Intelligent, sly, deep, beautifully produced series with great actors playing a brilliantly drawn variety of characters.  It is visually stunning but also meaningful-  images and modes of shooting reinforce the narrative, which is harrowing and heartbreaking.

B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Mostly of interest to devoted Dylan fans, but an extraordinarily cheap way to hear several really interesting previous unissued songs; esp. Annie's Song.  I'm very glad I bought this
0763644765|5.0|There are a couple scenes where he laughs out loud.  This book more than any of the others got him really excited about learning to go potty!!
B005DJREJS|5.0|I thought it was going to be another show that relied on silly teenage jokes and gags to get laughs.  Instead it had some pretty good story lines and the audience was able to feel what the characters were feeling.  I did  think the main character was a little wishy-washy when it came to her romance.  She seems smart in all the other areas, but can't seem to get a grip when it came to choosing her guy.  Hopefully some of that gets resolved in the next season, which I have not seen.  I would recommend this to YA and up.

B00BKBCF38|5.0|Alan Parsons killed the lead singer of Blue Oyster Cult, took over, and commanded the band to play satanic music.  If that sounds cool to you, you'll love it.  The first album has a song or 2 (Ritual, Genesis) that are better than anything on here, but this might be the better album overall.
1118232658|5.0|Before I begin my review I want to offer one piece of advice: Buy this book digitally! I have the digital copy and found it very convenient to check out links to content examples on my Kindle Fire. I probably would not have view the online content created by Socialnomics otherwise, and believe me, it is worth watching. I hope Qualman replicates the online content in future books.<br /><br />Socialnomics by Eric Qualman covers a variety of topics from the world of social media, including everything from buy-in to ROI and brand success stories to epic fails. This book takes a nonlinear approach to social media and understands that not every subject will be pertinent to every reader. From the beginning the audience is encouraged to jump around the book and tackle topics most relevant to their everyday life. I began with ROI and then jumped back to a chapter on engagement. The transition was seamless. However I found each chapter I read so informative I did end up reading the book cover to cover when all was said and done. No matter how savvy you are with social media, I can assure you there will be plenty of takeaways from this book.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Alan Parsons killed the lead singer of Blue Oyster Cult, took over, and commanded the band to play satanic music.  If that sounds cool to you, you'll love it.  This album was my gateway back into metal after 10+ years away.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Poorly written with unappealing characters.  This never comes close to living up to the hype surrounding it.  Women must be desperate.
B00008DDRX|4.0|Good race car movie that gives you a glimpse of old days of sports car driving, bought this along with another classic McQueen movie; Bullitt, for my son who didn't see either (at the movies, tv, dvd or vhs!). Recommend buying both and it will make a great two film movie night.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Fun and uplifting musical.  Thought it was great.  Pierce Brosman and Meryl Streep were so good in it.  All the actors did a good job and made this movie one of my favorites.
6304698526|4.0|Bought this for my son the Mustang owner/fanatic, along with LeMans. He was too young to see these movies on the big screen and didn't know anything about them when the 2006 Mustang Bullitt Edition car came to the Auto Show. This is a great chase movie, classic McQueen.  Buy and watch both,  makes a very enjoyable movie night.
B004OZOTSQ|2.0|I didn't really feel the need for this application. I probably didn't use it to it's full utility. Picked up on a free download day.
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|This is the second time I've used this book to help me transition. It's straightforward, easy to understand and actionable. It doesn't take long to read and each chapter builds upon the pervious to assist in creating a plan that makes sense.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|I found this game to be poorly designed. Gets old really quick. Not even a good time waster on a plane.
B00846REIS|5.0|I gave this  a  5 star because it's my favorite book! So so sexy and it ha<br />s realness to it. Not all hearts and butterflies,exciting and super hot! Have read it  twice now :) enjoy!
B005529BDK|3.0|This app was just ok. Gets old pretty quick. Good time waster on a plane or waiting for the dentist.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Tragic events but very enlightening as to what African Americans were going through at that time. Very insightful and inspiring. Definitely recommend that everyone watch it!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love this mixture of comedy and mystery.  The sheriff is great and truly makes this show worth the watching.  Wish it had run longer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this on my phone and love it. I was excited to find this for the Kindle. It still amazes me that my 9yr old can go further than me no matter how long I practice. Lol.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a very short read. The first chapter is a well written essay on the nature of genius; well worth reading.  The second gives a short summary of Tesla's genious.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It was a good game but again it should be a full version without pay. Everyone wants to play a full version game so tell me if there are out there. Thanks :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to take places as it is on my phone.  Work just like on the kindle.  Use it while waiting for appointments to happen.  Usually have my phone where as I forget to bring my kindle.
B000654YRY|3.0|I watch this video often, but I tend to jump around and skip certain songs.  There is no excuse for not including the entire performance (it was edited down to 90 mins), as some gems were left out.  I also don't like the clumsy back-and-forth between 2 different shows.
B004SBULWE|2.0|I really couldn't see the reason for keeping it on my computer.  The tasks it suggested killing weren't ones I wanted to kill.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a fun game to play, but waiting for stupid advertisements to load and then clearing them is a pain.<br />I'm going to look for another version w/o the ads.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|If you`re a fan of Tim Allen,this is a good one!Sit back and enjoy.Fun over the top comedy/SciFi/Tim Allen d`ont need to say any more.
B001230JXC|5.0|If you love Depeche Mode or just want a place to start, this is the album.  World in My Eyes and Halo are the sexiest songs ever!
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|Great sound from  a new group to my collection.Did really enjoy there sound pop with some cosmic thrown in for wholesome goodness!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Its refreshing to play a good old fashion mind challenge type of game. The best part of one player is your opponent can't make fun of you when you lose.
B005J7K964|5.0|Awesome movie period!!!!!!! If If If you love Rock&Roll put too cinema then this is balls to the wall nock your socks off feel good thing enjoy!!!!!!!!
B002RPR6DU|5.0|Classic sci-fi, Bruce Dern is spooky good as a slightly off-center caretaker of our future.  Way ahead of its time.
147892506X|5.0|At first I thought hey, that's not right, but then you get it.  I hope he does another book. So creative.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Very though provoking book. Simply amazing to hear the case studies that are hard to deny since they all describe similar events from heaven.
161969820X|5.0|I adore children stories and this was wonderful. I like how he changed the personalities of the characters. Very creative.
B0014C0BMU|1.0|I thought the first 2 movies were legit. This one sucked. Nerds might like this, as well as fat nerd-virgins. If I had to plug myself into this movie like they do in the Matrix, I would hope the needle just went through my face, killing me instantly, before I spent 2 dollars to watch Anime create an offspring with Men in Black.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Hello, Mr. King,<br /><br />Thank you for another host of undead nightmares to devour my dreams and haunt the dim corners of my mind. I have been one of the many Constant Readers who eagerly await your next novel since I was twelve when you hooked me with your brand of storytelling with The Stand (and hello to my old Boogeyman Friend Richard Flagg!). With Doctor Sleep you have really outdone yourself. I will not sleep for weeks without screaming that Mrs. Massey is in my bedroom. My wife, however, does not thank you. This book is an absolute masterpiece as riveting and terrifying as The Shinning. I loved seeing my old friends from the Overlook. For those fans of Mr. King, pick up this book and strap yourself in. You are in for one hell of a ride.<br /><br />Many thanks again, Constant Reader 242
B00006FDCD|5.0|I originally saw this movie when it came out and it scared the beegeesus out of me. I have loved rewatching this movie ever since!
B005PW3OS8|4.0|Great movie about the American spirit and the kind of person we should all strive to be. Never stop reaching for your dreams.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the books. It's the perfect combinations of sexy, romance, dramatic and eventful.<br />E.L. James is an maxing writer! I read all the books like 3 times each because there is so much information in them.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app! Love the ability to combine different sounds and customize them. Would be great to be able to save my combinations! Even better if we could submit them to a site to share with others. Thanks for the app!
B008469DGY|4.0|The game Is entertaining from the onset. It is relatively easy to begin with, never gets too hard. Unfortunately it ends far too quickly.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This software allows me to improve weak areas and it is as fun as a game.  So much more effective than my Rosetta Stone program, and a much better price!  I like the reminder feature as well.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you enjoy Tolkien, Eddings and other sword and sorcery books, you should enjoy this TV series. The show successfully creates a world similar to our medival history, but different in many respects. The central theme of the story is the contest between rulers of several realms to regain or retain self rule while battling those who would rule all. Conniving advisers and greedy merchants deceive both royalty and commoners and twist events to obtain their goals while others use armys, secret weapons, sorcery and dragons to obtain power and wealth. However, this world has summers that last several decades instead of months and followed by cold bitter winters that also last several but an unpredictable number of years. Therefore, the warmer times should be used to store food, fuel and make other preparations for winter. This is difficult if not possible to do when fighting wars. All may come to regret their self-centered diversions because legends tell of formidable evil beings that come from the north with winter. And winter is coming!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|At first I thought that this would be a very simple hidden mystery game. But oh how wrong I was. I thought there would be no jumpscares with ear buds on. I thought I was death when I beat the game. Overall very interesting and fun game
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I continued to enjoy this presentation of George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire and decided to read the original books while waiting for season three to be available.
B005NNURES|5.0|This has always been my favorite album.If there were 10 stars I'll give it a 20.<br />To me Roger Waters was the heart and soul of Pink Floyd. This album has Roger Waters written all over it.Glad they added When the Tiger Broke Free.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Initially I thought this might be boring but it was really fun and challenging but not to the point of frustration. It is in fact pretty addicting!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book that was really not  your  average one to begin with. This book fit the bill. The history was well researched. Well worth a read!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Just an AMAZING book. This book is sad. This book is happy. This book is capable of making you cry!
B00594XOZU|2.0|wont let me log in!!!!! its driving me crazy!! please fix it! it worked fine before the update. help please!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great Show. The characters are engaging and likable even if they do not always do the right thing. I highly recommend it!
B008B11RLQ|5.0|20 classic albums that shaped the culture we live in, from the most successful and influential entertainer of all time.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great Show. The characters are engaging and likable even if they do not always do the right thing. I highly recommend it!
B007PF7MGS|5.0|Dr. McDougall has done it again excellent book outlines the real deal.<br /><br />Stop wasting your time with fad and harmful diets get with the program the way we were supposed to eat.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Amazing movie one of my favorite movies of all time.<br />Great character development and story line.<br />Special effect are also Awesome.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game! Never played before, so I appreciate the hint feature. Hope that the are a lot of levels to go!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Works great and was really easy to attach. We actually didn't even need to recalibrate it, it just automatically worked!
B0060AY6FO|5.0|As always, a tale that keeps the reader going to the very end.  At times a little boring with all the little details but they do meet in the end.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|It sounds strange to say this, but this film reminds me of my childhood. When I was a small child, I would watch John Carpenter's Halloween every year in October. I have memories of my mother holding her hand over my eyes when certain female body parts made their appearance. These were wonderful times for me. I have loved the film ever since. Today, I appreciate it on another level. Carpenter knows how to build tension. What he was able to do with a modest budget is quite amazing. This is a wonderful film and I recommend owning it if you are a horror fan.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Enjoyed the character's - fit right in with the story that was told so well. Would recommend this book - could not put it down.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|great movie very moving great scenery could not wait to see what happened next will be watching over again and again
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I am seriously struggling to read this book all the way through. The author tries to prove that she is an educated, middle-class, beautiful breathtaking blonde in every other paragragh of this over 200 page memoir, detailing her fifteen month sentence in a prison camp. Its very annoying. She uses unnecessary \\"big words\\", that are usually writen out of context, making the book seem like a freshman college term paper. I would have given her an F if I was her proffessor. I mean seriously, it seems like while she was writing this book a thesaurus was her best friend. Who used the word \\"Berfet\\" instead of saying they are sad or upset in their everyday lives? Not even the most intellectual people in the world. It usually takes me two-three days max to finish a book that im barely interested in, but I have been trying to read this book for a week already and everytime I start reading it my eyes begin to roll simultaneously. I am forcing myself to read this book because I bought it, but my GOD its boring. I purchased it because I had finshed watching the mind blowing series on Netfix and needed something to hold me over untill the new season starts next year, so as a word of advice, if you want to buy this book for the same reason I did.... DO NOT!!! Save your money. Its nothing like the series. I wish I would have read the reviews first myself. I never write reviews but this book made me and I havent even finished it yet. There is no way this book deservee four and a half stars.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|This movie was well made, but really, your going to have to do a very, very good job to make another zombie movie interesting!<br />The zombies moved fast, which I liked,what I didn't like was the movies liberal under tones and even with Brad Pitt, no matter how good the previews look, it's just another zombie movie!<br />I would walk across the street to see &#34;28 Days Later&#34; first.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Actually this was a gift to my granddaughter who specifically requested this film.  She wrote to say she loves it.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Surprisingly my 4 1/2 year old wasn't scared. One of my all-time favorites and now hers too. I just wish it was free!
0345525558|5.0|This book was heart wrenching and heart warming.  The author told a beautiful story about a young woman recently out on her own after being in the foster care system most of her life.  The young woman's love of flowers and her innate ability to create beauty with flowers was intriguing.  The meanings and language of flowers was intertwined with the young girl's life in a fascinating story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft for the computer, so obviously, I love this! There's only one problem. Sometimes, when I get on with my friends, it randomly disconnects. But, it still earns a five star rating. I highly recommend this game to anyone who gets bored often. Great job, Mojang.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|I don't completely understand why I liked it sooo much, but it amazing. Its like a real life you'll never get.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|fun movie. Makes you feel good. twist at the end is a little unbelievable, but what the heck! It is worth the $5 and two hours.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Loved the book. How amazing what a pet can do in someone's life.  And how they are just put in your life at the right time. So incredibly happy that this guy was able to turn his story into a book
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|it's the best for it's price and since I brought the Amazon kindle I wanted everything by the same company.
B0064MGU98|4.0|After watching the first two episodes, I was hooked.  I had to watch all 20 + episodes straight through.  It's a good drama that keeps your interest with lots of interesting characters.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Review of 3D - With my system, the 3D Blu-Ray player and TV will not zoom to full screen.  (This is my first 3D purchase.)  If you watch at less than the recommended 12 feet, the 3D looks like paper layers in a 3D book.  My room is too small to watch at that distance. If I go into the hallway, I can see the 3D better but then I also have to wear my glasses under my 3D glasses to watch it since it is reduced to about 16\\" high on my 46\\" screen. My old 1979 26\\" Sony tube TV is almost that high! Recommend that unless you have a very large set, a large room and good vision that you stay away from this 3D disc.....(or only buy if you like wearing eye glasses under the 3D glasses and you have a large room).<br /><br />I have no problem watching 3D in the theater but because of the height loss and due to the default unswitchable theater screen dynamic (meaning 16:9), the figures are too small and look blurred.... What a waste of money!  Personally, I despise systems which will not let you change the default.  What idiot engineers thought that they knew better than the customer?  Quit making discs that block zoom settings or suffer poor sales!
B003U4UPTE|5.0|You becoming invested in each of the character's stories and just when you think you have it figured out, you don't! Classic JJ Abrams!!!
0671027573|5.0|This book has all the exciting romantic intrigue you could want.  It's sexy and the dialogue is creative and witty. I found myself giggling throughout.<br />It captured my interest from beginning to end; I couldn't put it down. To date, it's my all-time favorite book by Linda Howard and my favorite book (period).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game, its challenging yet easy enough for everyone. Perfectly kid friendly. I recommend for anyone who wants an overall fun and exciting game!
1407109375|5.0|My son wanted this book to complete his collection. It is just as good as the others in the series. What I love about this whole Hunger Games series is that we both read it and were able to talk about the characters, themes and development of the story. Reading it was a great way to get a connection with my teenage and pre-teen sons.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a nice light read that was easy to stick with and fun to the end.
B002KF2HWM|4.0|There are many subtle scenes in this movie. To fully catch them all, and appreciate this movie to its fullest extent, it must be viewed at least 2 times. The screenplay is very well done but complicated.
B002KREVCO|5.0|This compilation contains a great selection of highly sought after deep and long lost AC/DC tracks for the die hard fan or casual historian.  If I had to buy one CD package this year this would be it!  Had to listen again to remind me self just how good a drummer Phil Rudd was/is!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wonderfully acted. Damien Lewis and Mandy Patinkin are truly fabulous. Story line is exciting, keeps you guessing but doesn't drag things out forever. It gives you answers and then moves on from there. Finely crafted, and intelligently written and well worth the investment of your time.
B00A287PG2|3.0|The history of a firm that shaped western economy in the last 80 years.<br />And now six words to get my recomendation accepted ...
B000F1IQNM|4.0|Great movie lesson on the simple things are best in family. Stay strong in each other. recommened for kids who love magicical stuff.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|this was a pretty fast read - not what I was expecting but it was good.  I would tell my friends to read it
B0012NO4WO|5.0|This was a great movie.  I love Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves wasn't bad, either.  I like action movies and this one is definitely at the top of my list.
1451613512|5.0|Certain persons on the cultural/political scene have the temerity and audacity, nay the outright GALL, to dare to criticize the powers that be -- no matter what side of the political aisle, Left, Right, Center. People like Zinn and Noam Chomsky, scholars who study issues intensely before  commenting, following solid research principles learned through years of study. Stone is more an armchair historian so it was wise that he team up with an accredited historian for this project in the person of Mr. Kuznick. The book does not go into topics as deeply as Zinn and especially Chomsky might, but it is an overview after all and covering an entire century at that. As such it is an outstanding contribution to our knowledge and understanding of United States foreign policy in the 20th Century. It's about saying what we got right and what we got wrong and let's talk about it if we don't agree. If we love our country we can't do any less. Review by the author of Stir It Up: The CIA Targets Jamaica, Bob Marley and the Progressive Manley Government, a novel [[ASIN:1477519890 Stir It Up: The CIA Targets Jamaica, Bob Marley and the Progressive Manley Government]]
B00915G6MG|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. Worth the wait especially after seasons 9 cliffhanger. Season 10 explores even deeper into the characters and a lot more is explained. Truly excellent
B009NH6JRE|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in some time now. Very well written and always delivers!!
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|This movie combines the fabulous scenery of Scotland and the Yemen, and glimpse at how critical cultural competency can be, and a sweet love story. I loved it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicting! We used to play this game with quarters at the fair! Glad this one is free! Thanks Amazon! Love it!
B000ID3KU6|4.0|It's a wild wild west.It's a slow start but great settings. The story line requires patience but picks up steam. If you are Sergio Leone fan you will love this.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|A good ole slam and bang.  Older actors who can deliver a cliched line with a straight face is too funny.  Viewers need to be a certain 'age' to catch and get some of the inside jokes.  Lots of fun!!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|First, you should know that this book is in no way like the movie or (I should say)...the movie is in no way like the book.  The movie has a beginning, middle and ending with a resolution…this book does not.  There are no continuing characters or a story line to become attached to.  It’s basically fictional news/history.  It was a series of interviews of different people all giving their accounts of what happened during World War Z...similar to the Band of Brothers style except not everyone was a soldier.  It is a book that I did not enjoy reading as I was reading it, but I enjoyed talking about it after I read it.  It's difficult to explain... for example - most people don't necessarily ENJOY watching the News, but after they obtain their new knowledge (via the News) they talk about it every chance they get and throw in their opinions on what’s happening.  I didn’t love this book, but I didn’t hate it either.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The KIng rules. He is like fine wine that gets perfected with age.<br />I LOVED THIS BOOK AND LOOK FORWARD TO HIS NEXT. Thank you for giving Danny a happy ending and introducing us to A bra .
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This story is so complex and enchanting. I look forward to reading it again. The descriptive words of the author transports you to the mysteries of the night circus, and leaves you wishing to return.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this show and hope fot it's continous<br />For a long time.<br />The plots are good and excellent actors.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show. The characters are hard to let go of. I can't wait for the next season.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Even though this shows carries on the media's negativity on how a woman should be physically objectified, the romance is real.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Good for doctor's offices. I play it loud. This upsets the nurses who sometimes send me to the front of the line to get ride of me.
1863514201|5.0|This technique is incredibly beautiful and the instructions given are very concise.  I hope I have the time and patience to pursue this, along with all my other fiber art endeavors; I am very inspired!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was ready to give up on this book.  That was about one third though the book when things started to come around.  That's a little to long for me.  At that polnt  I couldn't put this book down.  So many twist and turns of the characters with great detail kept things moving fast forward.  I really enjoyed this book.  Not one you could anticipate the ending.
B0086DB566|4.0|This is a refreshingly different version of the story. Not terribly dark as others. Julia Roberts was great as the stepmother.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I downloaded this as the free app of the day. It's a fun game and I think a well done app.
B009LDD54K|5.0|This was an action packed season, and very delightful to watch. Great buy for fans of drama and historical fiction.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|Never took the time to really watch this movie before. I am so glad that I did.<br />Awesome story with memorable cast...
B0031RS8UI|5.0|This book is very funny, you can get lost in it and picture the story as it moves on. Vrry easy to read
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Take your personal study to the next level, or get a convenient on the go way to build your spiritual study of the Word of God.<br /><br />I recommend this for all!
0571202284|5.0|this is the most useful book i have gotten explaining practical animation.  I have also bought the expanded version as it came available
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|I'm a huge movie buff and a major bookworm, but I usually don't write reviews. I think that this series of films from Linklater, Delpy and Hawke are stunning and gorgeous works of art, decidedly major feats across the board: in acting, directing, writing and camerawork. As the third film in the series, Before Midnight stands out the most to me. It reminded me a bit of Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, with Delpy holding my primary attention the entire length of a movie (not to give Hawke, who was also brilliant, his due credit).<br /><br />My word of advice, start from the beginning, enjoy these masterpieces.<br /><br />But...seriously Sony? A movie of this quality really should not look so cheap.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|This was another exciting chapter to the 24 saga. Jack is probably the most ruthless yet. I cannot wait for the new series coming up !!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game need more like it. but it wont let me go any futher say i need to down load update but there isnt one
1594135312|3.0|The book is good but it can get tedious and boring in certain portions, it may have too much information about the people and less about the actual memory techniques.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is my favorite app. I love the wide selection of sounds and the hz tones really work great. When things are hectic just add the relaxation 10hz and all around start to relax and mellow out. At bed time setting the timer for just 30 min helps you relax and get a great night sleep. I recommend this app highly
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There are already about 400 reviews for Dr. Sleep, so I'm not sure if I can add much more.  I will say this:  No one can suck me into a book like Stephen King.  His characters instantly capture my attention, and this book was no exception.  If you're a King fan, you will most likely enjoy this book.  If not, I think you're missing out.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Pretty good effects but mediocre story line, glad I didn't waste my money on it at the theater. Worth a few bucks to watch it streaming.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Good news for a change, encouraging for parents and educators alike. I think you will dind it helpful and cause hope to rise up for the future
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Listened to this on repeat for about a month.  It's fantastic music.  Phillip is very talented and I look forward to his future music.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I love Bruce Willis. Mostly I will give anything he is in a good rating. I was upset slightly because of the plot where they killed off one of my favorite characters at the beginning. (No, I'm not going to spoil it, sheesh.) The writing was amusing and I am really glad they kept it at the level of kid friendly by not showing people dying or bleeding all over the place. It was a fun piece of fluff.<br />I would not show it to my children as they are both under the age of 6, but I think older kids might be able to handle it.<br />If you want it to be the children's cartoon you watched growing up you will be disappointed.
0761174192|5.0|I have purchased for many years--to use at work and now that I am retired to keep me straight on what day of the week it is since at times the days seem to run together.  I keep on the island in my kitchen and change each morning  after I put on a pot of coffee.  I purchased two last year--one for me and one for a retired friend and have already purchased two for 2014--one for me and another for my retired friend as a Christmas gift.  She loves the calendar as much as I do being the cat lovers that we are.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed. The plot twist surprised me and I'm not often surprised. I found the characters real and relatable.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|I am playing saga rally on a tablet. !!!!!!!!!!! wow<br />Ok it isnt shadow gun but its every part of the game i grew up with on a device thats envelope size w.t.f  :o)
B009JZSC9S|2.0|This show used to be really good, but it's time to end it.  The drama has devolved to uncreative sexual sleaze and they have run out of interesting legal scenarios.  My wife and I used to enjoy the show, but we're giving it up.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Erotica written by an author, a real author . . . who can write. If you want to know the plot line, there is a very useful \\"Book Description\\" above. I think reviews should focus on the skills of the author, not on recapping what the book is about. That said, A Girl's Adventure - full length erotic novel by Chloe Thurlow is a what most readers of this genre will want . . . it is a true novel with a well thought out plot, authentic dialogue and characters we can identify with - characters that we care about. There is excitement and adventure, even surprises. Thurlow merges all those classic ingredients that make a good story and then adds steamy yet elegantly written x-rated scenes. Good writing and a real story make the sex even better! These are the books we should be hearing about instead of fifty shades. If this is your genre, this is highly recommended - 5-stars!

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a good book; the style was not my favorite but the writing is so strong that I forgot the style. What I liked most about this book was the way it showed that as a woman, the choices we have to make are not easy and sometimes you just &#34;fall into&#34; those choices.

B00DNNQNW0|5.0|I follow Katie and love her voice so I had to have this CD.  She is true to her craft and gives us new music for the &#34;soundtrack&#34; of our lives.  I did have a problem with the jewel case packaging.  It was so tightly sealed that even after a half an hour, I was unable to open it.  My son was finally able to get the CD out, but the jewel case was broken.  Easy to replace the jewel case but disappointing packaging.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite vampire movies. The story line is beautiful and it is very different from any other vampire movie out there. I highly recommend it!
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse is a complex group, progressive, avant-guarde, working in a lot of sharps & flats. The &#34;2nd Law&#34; is superb music making, with Matthew Bellamy sharing vocal talent with other band member Chris Wolstenholme, whose voice is also amazing. His vocals on &#34;Save Me' are truly inspiring & hear-felt. M-m-muh-muh-&#34;Madness&#34; is not the only excellent song on this CD. Every song is filled with well-crafted & sublime artistry. I always hear echoes of Freddie Mercury & my favorite band of all time, Queen, on Muse's CDs. The overdubs, the multi-layering, the vocal prowess, the classical technique meets Rock & Roll, are all elements in Queen's music. I was unhappy with their last effort: &#34;The Resistance&#34;, & I loved &#34;Origin of  Symmetry&#34;, &#34;Absolution&#34;, & &#34;Black Holes & Revelations&#34;. For some reason, I didn't like &#34;The Resistance&#34;. But Muse has made up for it in abundance! A definite keeper!
