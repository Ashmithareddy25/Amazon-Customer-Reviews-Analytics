0345528581|5.0|I love Mark Lauren's approach to working out! He walks the reader through every exercise and explains extremely well how the programs that rely primarily on bodyweight really work- and get results.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I am addicted to The Walking Dead. Wonderful series! Recommend it to everyone. Lots of emotion tied up in this series!
1936608898|5.0|The whole30 program is amazing... I can't say enough good things about it. I'm almost done with my whole30 and I look and feel incredible. I didn't start this to lose weight, but my pants are fitting better than they have in over a year. I've also been able to seriously change my eating habits in a way I never thought possible. Making it this far has drastically improved my confidence, that if I can change my diet from the unhealthy disaster that it was, to the incredibly healthy diet it is now, I can do anything.<br /><br />I started the plan without the book and just using the info available on their website, but I highly suggest anyone on whole30 buy the book asap. It has so much extra information that will help you along the way that is not available online (or that you didn't know to look for online). And it has a whole chapter on reintroduction, which is really why I bought the book.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It really helps because it tells you to be cautious in life. The game is now my guide to a longer life.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Very interesting portrayal of this family and club. Kinda makes me want a cut. Can't wait to see what mischief Clay will stir up next. He is one shady character for sure.
0399237720|5.0|The book was perfect. I was originally going to buy the big hardcover book but I'm glad I went back and ordered the giant board book instead. Besides the fact that the board book was $33 cheaper, it is def easier to maintain than the hardcover.<br /><br />I used it for story time at my sons first bday party (Very Hungry Caterpillar theme) and it is the perfect size to standup on my lap and for all the kids to see the pictures. Also it comes with a mini stuffed caterpillar that my son loves to play with.<br /><br />Great buy!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the coolest gadget. My kids are constantly fighting over the tv that I have this hooked up to. Its amazing.
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Big fan of Mr. Jackson as well as bluegrass. What could be better than both? Well worth downloading if you like either one.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I like this browser/version because it supports flash_Android_ICS on the Fire, where later versions or browsers don't.  It's part of a baseline combination for getting Flash sites to run e.g. Youtube
B00594XOZU|1.0|All my friends have kik but me nd i dont have no other way to Interact with them :/<br />Kik needs a major upgrade<br />It won  let u sign up or log in it needs to be improved smh
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|It's a great game but I don't think that it's fair that you have to pay to play the game more than once
B00881VLCE|5.0|So much fun . You have to get this if you like jigsaw puzzles. You will love it. There's something for everyone.
B00EXVZW6E|3.0|I love hidden object games.  The problem for me is that the hidden items are sometimes so small that I don't recognize them for what they are even if I click &#34;hint.&#34;  I am nearly 70, so maybe it is a problem with my eyesight?  :)
1932100660|5.0|I read a library copy of this book first but had to have a copy of my on to re-read again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Plug-in to TV, download the cast extension for Google chrome browser and watch/view your chrome browser content on your TV (only PC or MAC; does not work on your smart phone) You can watch Netflix and You Tube as well (all devices).
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I prefer to see Matthew McConaughey in these types of roles where he is not trying to play up his looks.  It's not a great movie, but a good way to kill a rainy Sunday afternoon.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This so is super awesome! I didn't think I would have liked it, but now I'm hooked! It's very interesting to see how they mix the actors and actresses from the previous season.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Death of Kings is another great Cornwell novel full of historic references and depictions. I always enjoy returning to the 13th ,14th cn to revel in the magnificent descriptions and details offered in these novels. I highly recommend this series and this entry for those who enjoy historical action. They are not for everyone as my wife sees no value in the tales. But I see that as her loss. Any Bernard Cornwell is a delight to me and I have read them all I believe.<br />Jack
B0064MGU98|5.0|This season (and this series for that matter) has incredibly smart dialogue with really interesting plot lines.  Watching one of these episodes is something I really look forward to in my day!
B00C81LYH2|5.0|I purchased this for my granddaughter and I have to say it is absolutely beautiful.  I know she will love it on Christmas Day.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|This is a very useful and well made app.<br />It does everything it says it will.<br />this really helped me to organize the files on my kindle Fire.<br />I love it.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|my daughter totally loves this music. I bought this for her for her birthday and she really enjoyed this. great music and purchase.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought it for a train ride to St. Louis for my boyfriend and I to read and try to role play.  Unfortunately I wasn't turned on nor was I intrigued by the story line.  It kinda made me feel like rich people are twisted.  All of his demanding and bossiness doesn't work well for me.  I didn't finish the book but I really made the attempt when I heard about the movie, but if what I read so far was garbage how in the world were they able to get away with three bad books?
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I have to admit, I'm easy to please when it comes to fantasy or sci fi movies - fairy tales kinda fit those genres.  This one was better than I expected, and I suspect those of a similar taste will find it entertaining enough to be worth the $$$.  Enjoy!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is okay.  I dont really like that you have to buy things to progress quickly.  I do like that there are different ways to search (in dark, shadows, regular), and I like the missions.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Its great to go back and watch where it began. As great as the new movies are, and the fantastic special effects, its always nice to return to the original show. So many ideas began here with Gene and the original cast. Considering they had no spending money and cardboard sets, they did a great job. The smart writing and great acting was enough.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|What terrible terrible movie.  I don't think I laughed once. Save your money.  I felt embarrassed for the actors who were clearly just doing this movie for the pay check.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|It would have been nice to see Camerlot in happy times without Morgana but that doesn't make good viewing. It also might have been nice to have Arthur know about Merlin's magic earlier but at least the series is complete.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPHY. INCREDIBLE STORY.<br />Read the book The Viking about Ragnar's life in the 60s.<br /> Great series. Well done people..
0307938905|4.0|It took me a while to get into but when I got the players sorted out I was enthralled.  Would make a blockbuster of a movie if cast right and if David Copperfield was called in to consult..  Good love story.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Good action and decent storyline to keep me interested.  Not a fantastic flick but good enough for a weekend movie night.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its good for anyone I hope you enjoy this game to it is fun fast and playful this game is very addictive
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show<br />It is silly, fun,always interesting<br />I watch it before I go to sleep just to relax
B00FEHXISA|4.0|I liked that they went deeper into the mind of Tony Starks in this Iron Man. Overall - pretty good movie.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I hate to give this beautiful, phenomenally acted movie a lukewarm rating, but I just can't get over the pace of this movie.<br /><br />Before I get into why the three-movie format doesn't work for this story, I would like to state that I am a lifelong fan of Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, and Middle Earth. My dissatisfaction does not stem from a dislike of the franchise or the story, nor is it the result of a short attention span. While I have an enormous respect for the attention to detail that has gone into every Peter Jackson adaptation thus far, I believe there is also incredible power in brevity. If Tolkien has intended the stories contained in the appendices and notes to inform the main storyline in a major way, I believe they would have been included in the books. While the extra information and characters are interesting, all they serve to do in An Unexpected Journey is provide filler and drastically slow the pace of the narrative.<br /><br />At its heart, The Hobbit, unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is a largely straightforward children's story. There's a journey, a battle, and a victory. I truly believe The Hobbit would have been a powerful single film, but as a third of a sweeping epic, it just doesn't work. None of this is to say that Tolkien's appendices are irrelevant, just that if he didn't consider them relevant enough to include in the story, turning a single short book into three (incredibly long) movies to include them is unnecessary.<br /><br />That being said, I *love* Martin Freeman in the role of Bilbo, and the inclusion of Far over the Misty Mountains Cold was a pleasant surprise. You also get a sense for the dwarves' distinct personalities, a feature decidedly missing from Tolkien's narrative. I'm still looking forward to the future installations of The Hobbit, but truth be told, what I'd love to see at the end of all this is a good edit of all three movies into the length of one.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This is one get great documentary set. I always look to buy the ones with David Attenborough narrating because he just tells a better story and his voice just goes so much better with the documentary than Oprah or Morgan Freeman. Me and my wife watched this over the course of a weekend and I have to say we were glued to the screen the entire time. The shots that are shown are amazing. This would make one great gift and I would not hesitate to buy again.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|If I could break this down, I'd give at least four stars for how illuminating this memoir was about (low-security) prisons and the &#34;war on drugs,&#34; but I had a LOT of issues with the memoir aspects of the narrative. Not only does it come across as self-serving, which a number of other readers have noted, but it's not especially well written, jumps around a lot (coming off more as a compilation of brief anecdotes), and queer erasure is everywhere. Kerman goes out of her way to tell us she's &#34;not like that&#34; (her words), which not only serves as a way to negate her involvement with Nina (for OitNB viewers, that's Alex) and the drug trade, but every time a lesbian or &#34;gay-for-the-stay&#34; prisoner is addressed, Kerman even feels the need to tell us *she's* not gay, when whether she is or not has no bearing on any of these women.<br /><br />What drew me into the Netflix series was not only the complexity of the women in the narrative, but their sheer humanity. That they are neither blameless victims of a broken system, nor are they criminals without hope for redemption. You don't get that sense from this book. Rather than a human picture of prison, you learn instead about Kerman's incredibly picky eating and obsessive workouts. Instead of seeing her truly connect with any of these prisoners, you get a detached snapshot of their idiosyncrasies. Kerman doesn't treat these women, with very few exceptions, as anything other than moderately amusing to a privileged white woman.<br /><br />It's a rare day when I enjoy the screen adaptation of a book more than its source, but I truly did not enjoy this book. The Netflix adaptation may not be the real story, but it's *a* real story.<br /><br />**Side note: the majority of the prisoners in the Netflix adaptation are either amalgamations of several women in Kerman's narrative, or are made up altogether. If you're expecting to learn more about Morello, Nicky, Red, Suzanne, Miss Claudette, Sophia, Pennsatucky, Daya, Taystee, Poussey, Tricia, Watson, Yoga Jones, or even Alex, you're out of luck. You see facets of each of these women (with the exception of Daya) in Kerman's memoir, but the only characters who remain more or less untouched are Piper and Red (&#34;Pop&#34; in real life).
B0060AY6FO|5.0|A cute story with the characters of Pride & Prejudice as a murder mystery.  The characters were developed well enough for those of us who haven't read P&P to understand their personalities and relationships.  As another reviewer mentioned, and I agree, it would make a great movie.  Our book club read this and most all of us enjoyed it thoroughly.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Good story, definitely a page turner, I can already see the movie and there are some valuable lines and insights.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great story and fantastic actors. We watched it twice! David Tennant is one of my favorite actors. Lots of plot twists and turns.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Play this game while having the car serviced, waiting at the doctors office or  just when you're feeling bored and the time will go by so fast!!! Before you know it you've spent hours playing...
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|After just one listen to this album I had to buy it. Chvrches nails it with The Bones of What You Believe. It is synth pop in all it's glory with amazing vocals on top of fantastic beats.<br /><br />I don't know all the names of the songs but they are all good. Sometimes this genre can all sound the same, but each little gem stands out on its own.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|i love it it is cool but  it could have some more detail i like the micro figures they should make the end next
B000RIWAVW|1.0|I understand some bad movies have cult followings, but I didn't see anything to warrant the sort of fandom that seems to surround this movie. There's no gore and very few genuine scares, instead theres a lot of stupid movie people running around doing stupid movie people things. For example, at the beginning of the movie where the nurse and Dr Loomis are pulled up to the sanitarium - the nurse looks in the rear view mirror and watches some kook jump up on the roof, then thinking quickly she hits the accelerator, throwing him off the roof and she gets away safely. Just kidding, that's what regular folks would've done. She actually rolls the window down and sticks her head out for a better look and gets herself mauled.  I know I'm probably offending a lot of fans by saying this, but the movie just isn't scary. At all. While watching older movies I try and take into account the difference in audience expectations in the time in which they were released, and how those movies would have been recieved back then. Scientific studies have shown that even if I had seen this movie in the theater back when it was first released I still would have thought it sucked. Defenders of this movie frequently use the word \\"suspense\\", and how this film uses it in lieu of gore, blood, genuine scares or good writing. I'm a big Hitchcock fan so I do know about and understand the use of suspense. Halloween does not, I never felt suspense while watching the movie, I mainly felt anger at the stupid characters. The Total Chick - I don't even know her name.. I call her \\"The Total Chick\\" because every line of dialogue she spoke either started with, ended with, or otherwise contained the word \\"Totally\\". God I was glad when she got killed. There was one scene that really, really worked well, it was near the end when Jamie Lee Curtis' character was standing with her back to a darkened doorway (as stupid movie people are wont to do) and Michael Myer's face is slowly revealed in the shadows. That was really creepy. Now if they could have had more moments like that built into the movie, and less 70's movie character bumblings, Halloween might have been a pretty decent little flick.eally creepy. Now if they could have had more moments like that built into the movie, and less 70's movie character bumblings, Halloween might have been a pretty decent little flick.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My family loves this, we use it all the time to show each other stuff from the web. We cast just about anything you can think of onto the screen. We use all of our iDevices and they work great you just have to use a google app to cast. We also use our laptops with chrome, which is the browser we use anyway, and cast anything from the web to the TV.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|One trick zombie. My second time seeing this movie no fun the second time around I should have left it alone.
B002M9WW30|5.0|What can you say it is ROCKY, if you liked the movies then you will love to have these in your collection.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very involving.  I couldn't wait to read what would happen next. The story kept making surprising turns and bringing in new elements
B000I62JAK|5.0|Though the plot of the film is undoubtedly weak, Ben Stiller's comedic timing is impeccable and Owen Wilson really complements him as a costar.  People still talk about this film, and though it is superficial, it's a great comedy that pokes good-natured fun at the fashion industry--although it's only a little over a decade old, it's kind of a cult classic.  And one that would be funny even after a second or third watch.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I played this game on my phone, Kindle, laptop, and my tablet. I love it! I stopped playing for a while because I was stuck on level 181 (a puzzle in a group of difficult puzzles they call a Hell's Cluster) for months. Be warned: I still didn't pass it on my own - I ended up buying lollipop smashers to pass the level. But, I just canNOT stop playing this game. The graphics are bright and pretty, the music is creepy and eerie, but it lulls you (well, me) into this zone where it's just you and the game....and then you hear the music all day in your head. And now I hear it in my head...
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Honestly one of the best books I've read. You will not find a cliche or a cookie-cutter ending here. The depth and the honesty that the author delves in to is magnificent - buy it buy it buy it. Trust me.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I did like the first one (hey! no throwing rotten fruit!) so I was curious to see how this incarnation would be handled. Lots of fun!

034580709X|3.0|First in the Inspector Harry Hole mystery series featuring a Norwegian detective sent to Sydney, Australia.<br /><br />My Take<br />No, Hole being sent to Australia is more of a one-off. He thinks it may be a test to see if he can handle the pressure.<br /><br />I must confess, I kept reading this simply because so many GR readers rave about the series. It was slow going until about halfway through before things started to pick up. In part I wondered if this slow, low-key pace is part of Nesbø's Norwegian culture. We finally get that kick when we learn that Hole has a weakness, but it feels like more of an oops, Harry needs to be conflicted tossed in as a last-minute thought.<br /><br />I do love our exposure to the average, everyday Australian culture in which people are so like the average American, with their lower- and middle-class jobs: they sell drugs, are policemen or guards, gays, hookers, bartenders, circus clowns, run hotels. The treat is in both the similarity and the differences. The first gives us a baseline for picturing them in our heads while the second provides that sense of divergence. Then there's the modern Aboriginal mess of covert racism that exists, and it's similarity to what happened with Native Americans in the U.S. when they were forced to assimilate.<br /><br />I thought that Nesbø's handling of Hole's sudden mental breakthrough was unsupported with extremely few hints for the readers. Harry suddenly realized? Right… How White's and his mother's relationship, Harry's romance, and Otto were handled were also huh, what? moments. As for Joe, he seemed to come out of left field. For a moment I thought I had picked up another book to read. Then there's Harry's insta-love, followed by insta-something else. For such a traumatic event, I'd'a thought Nesbø would have maximized the emotion of it. But like too much in this story, it's neglected.<br /><br />Otto Rechtnagel has maintained a façade as a hundred percent, card-carrying homosexual since the age of ten.&#34;<br /><br />Sigh, I did fall in love with Andrew. A sign, I guess.<br /><br />Nesbø's handling of the alcoholism was well done, even if I never did pick up on the why. Especially Harry's confession to Birgitta. It made a nice twist when Harry said &#34;I've been given everything I asked for.&#34;<br /><br />I'll go on and read Cockroaches , 2, once it's translated into English and released April 2014, primarily because of those raves (#3, The Redbreast , is already translated into English). Of course, I guess it's always possible that those raving about Harry Hole might have been the same readers raving about the Fifty Shades Trilogy...<br /><br />The Story<br />It's a sad, horrific murder that finds Harry Hole in Sydney, but Andrew more than makes up for it as he steers Hole through the town that knows him, playing tourist. It does appear to be what McCormack wants---paying lip service to Norwegian interest in the murder of one of their own.<br /><br />Only Harry's never been one for lip service, at least not out of bed.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Inspector Harry Hole (Harry's las name is pronounced Hooley) is a recovering alcoholic from Norway. Ronny Stiansen, Harry's partner, was the impetus for Harry to quit.<br /><br />Andrew Kensington is an Aboriginal detective who suffered through one of the government's ideas of &#34;making it up to the natives&#34;. Neil McCormack is the Head of Crime Squad for Surry Hills in Sydney. Detective Larry Watkins is the standoffish leader of the investigative unit. The very meticulous Sergey Lebie is Watkins' right hand man. Yong Sue is the youngest team member and will laugh at anything.<br /><br />Inger Holter is a young Norwegian woman who's been murdered. Birgitta Enquist worked with Inger at the Albury, a gay bar. Alex Tomaros, a.k.a., Mr. Bean, a.k.a., Fiddler Ray, is the bar manager and not much liked. Hunter Robertson was Inger's landlord and neighbor with an interesting secret. It did makeme laugh when we finally learn the truth about his &#34;hobby&#34;.<br /><br />Evans White is a drug dealer with an eye for the ladies; his mother, Margaret Dawson, is one of the original hippies and now runs Crystal Castle. Mother Kindheart, a.k.a., Angelina Hutchinson, is one of White's neighbors in Nimbin.<br /><br />Robin &#34;The Murri&#34; Toowoomba is an Aboriginal boxer who looks up to Andrew as a father figure. Otto Rechtnagel is another friend of Andrew's. A flaming gay man who performs as a clown in the circus, the Australian Travelling Show Park. Joseph is a drunk who hangs out at the park with his own sad story. Borroughs owns the Cricket. Joe runs a low-key, cheap hotel.

B009HUB40Y|3.0|It's a jewels matching game. I found it to be a little on the boring side, then again, I prefer there to be some kind of adventure mode where you have goals or tasks to accomplish. Some may like this game just fine.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Riveting story, well told.  Read books 2 and 3 over the weekend.  Couldn't put it down.  Would recommend for people who like a good story but don't usually enjoy reading.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|PERFECT! I can't say anything else to more adequately describe this sleeve. I prefer to use my Kindle Fire HD &#34;naked,&#34; but for when it's not in use, this sleeve is exactly what I need.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a great free clock--I haven't checked the alarm or anything because I just wanted a clock for my Kindle that I could use in the bathroom when I was taking a shower. It works fine, but of course there is the obligatory ad when you open it--not a problem to me. I do wish that the numbers were a little bigger or that the edges were a little clearer, but otherwise it serves the purpose quite nicely. You do have to be careful though because if you leave it on it drains the battery because I guess it overrides the shutoff...
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I downloaded this app so I could play with it with my young niece and nephew. Once I opened it, I quickly realized that in order to use the app, add-ons had to be purchase. Not cool.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is a vast improvement over my old ergonomic one. It fits my hand very well, the included weights that can be added to the mouse really make a difference and the extra buttons for your thumb save some time once you learn how to use it. Before, I'd lazily lay my hand over my mouse and move it with just a few fingers, but with this Anker mouse I have a really comfortable grip. It's sturdy, doesn't feel cheap and is a steal for the price. I'm going to get another one for my work computer.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I believe I've given the last 8 or so novels in the series a 3-star rating. As I'm thinking about it, it's pretty much just &#34;for old time's sake.&#34; I'm pretty sure I gave the first few books, which I devoured in days) 4 or 5 star ratings. As usual, Harris' writing is good, the editing is good, and the characters are as we remember them... except Sookie. She just seems... off. I don't think think it was an inevitable ending, and I really didn't like it. Unlike the previous novel (which draaaaaaaagggged on), the story flowed, but it seemed haphazard, like she was so sick of writing about Sookie, so she just threw this together. I understand that writers sometimes lose their muse, I can especially see this happening in such a long series, but I'd rather have it unfinished or wait until the inspiration returns (think Game of Thrones and the length of time between those novels).
B00F880I7E|5.0|I have watched it twice now. I have no issues watching it on my ipad. But I haven't been able to download it on Playlater yet (it may not be avail for download yet). The story is building and I cant wait for the next couple of episodes!

B000ICLRJ8|5.0|I love the explosions and stress factors built into this movie. The plot is good and you need to buy it to have as a good part of your personal collection to watch every year! most movies are really getting boring, but this one is worth the buy!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The acting was very good.... I just found it very slow. (I do believe, however, I'm in the minority on this one.)
B0053O89KG|5.0|Epic. Emotional. Sexy. Fun. Smart. Flirty. Angsty. These two got A+ in chemistry. Come on now. How can you resist.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Just awesome - love this game. You have to use your head to solve puzzles. I can't recommend it enough.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|It's Castle. The best show on television. It just play these discs on repeat until they won't play anymore then I order new ones.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Not my cup of tea, I think I only played it once. I'm giving it three stars because the graphics were game, play response was good, and I'm sure that people who like these types of games will enjoy it.
B00355L2TU|3.0|It just ok.  I have viewed it only once.  Maybe this week I will learn to like it better as I use it daily.........
B0088P2A7A|3.0|The app's all right, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the functionality.  It's just (for me! can't speak for anyone else) pointless for me to use, as it's just as easy to use my browser.
B00FVS3RZQ|1.0|It won't let me buy the walking dead. What is the deal? It just keeps giving me an error message.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|If it's a \\"full\\" version of a G5 hidden object adventure game I own it. I've played them all. Without seeming redundant G5 remains one of the Top 3 game developers in the Amazon app world (the other two being Big Fish and Alawar). Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden is a masterpiece in the app world of the highest quality. It is every bit as good as their other two offerings, Dark Arcana and Nightmares from the Deep and stacks up side by side with anything Big Fish or Alawar has to offer. This game is challenging, unsettling, absorbing and it drips with atmosphere. The in-game map that can be pulled up is brilliant; which allows you to know where all of your actions remain. What I don't understand about G5 is why they don't offer a full version of all of their HO games. Big Fish is guilty of this also. I would buy every one of their games if they offered the full versions, but I won't take up precious space on my Kindle for free trial versions. One other note about G5's business practices. I realize that each person has their own opinion on how much a game is worth to them based on the value they place on it and the experience they have playing it, but G5's $4.99 price point on these games is way too high. Both Alawar and Big Fish offer all of their games at a $1.99 or $2.99 price point. Which is more in line with what these are worth. As good as G5 games are, they are comparable with the other developers games, but not better. There is nothing that warrants the higher price point. A perfect example is Alawar's \\"Weird Park\\" which, in my opinion, is the longest HO game around and probably one of the best games available on the Kindle. And that one sells for 99 cents. In G5's defense, they are pretty good at offering their games at a 99 cent price point for a limited time on occassion, and I am grateful for that. Which is more than I can say for Big Fish who never discounts their pricing. Bring on more high quality adventure games, G5. You have a fan for life.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|too difficult for a new 4 yr. old to figure out & another game that you need to spend more $ to advance, yuk!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved the story!  Was intrigued with the opening words and couldn't put it down until I finished. A masterpiece worthy if the brief time it will take you to read!
B004RQVVGU|5.0|I had this album when I was in high school and bought it as a present for myself recently.  I hear some of the songs on the radio, but wanted to hear the rest. I love it and highly recommend it.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Addict now, thanks. I started to check on the fun factor but ended blasting through the game and never putting my game down.
B000002UY5|5.0|I love this CD.  I love the music and listening to all the songs.  Shannon's voice sings them perfectly.  I highly recommend buying this.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|haven't used this app as much apps on my phone. It is pretty detailed as hours of use availability.  price is great pretty robust for free app.
B001AP11L6|5.0|The White Stripes is a great band!  I love their sound and music. I enjoy all the songs and Elephant did not disappoint.  I highly recommend it to any new or old fans.!
0156528207|5.0|The book has been one that is close to me. So i gifted that to a friend who is close to me. The delivery was quick and was in great condition.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Very funny for adults and children.... The constant talk of them dying was a little off putting but guess all the movies are like that!
B000RLHDUM|5.0|I love this movie. Renee Russo is way smarter than all the guys...but one...and knows how to manage it. A great character. Acting, story, setting, all excel.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|One of the best seasons of Supernatural so far! It focus's more on the relationship between Sam and Dean, yet it still manages to make you laugh!
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|If you've never seen Hook, you're a crazy person. It is a great movie about children and imagination. I love imagination.
B00AA7V8H2|5.0|Once I started watching I couldn't stop...one episode right after the other.  Now on to Season 2!  I really love this show!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|it is way better than dumb ways to live. the song is so funny. who knew this could be so fun
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game!!! I really enjoy the everyday fun... I look forward to playing this game everyday... Even my children love to play.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Balcacci never disappoints his readers.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers.  The hero is always someone we can identify with.
B000FA5STS|1.0|I've enjoyed many of David Baldacci's books, although none of them are what I'd consider deep- more appropriate for a summer read or an audiobook in the car, where you don't have to pay complete attention.  Total Control must have been an early novel, though.  It's written as if the author's only experience in life is from movies and television- here's how an FBI agent acts, this is what an IT guy is like, etc.  The female lawyer is especially bad- she's supposed to be a partner at a very large law firm, but both the police and the bad guys manipulate her by telling her all the trouble she's in, how she'll spend the rest of her life in jail, when she hasn't really done anything wrong.  A partner at a large law firm wouldn't fall for that.<br /><br />It's also annoying how extreme everything is- engines are massive, storms assault the entire Northeast.  Why does everything have to be over the top?  Also, why is everything thick- tick carpet, thick door, thick drapes, thick clouds, thick fingers, thick shoulders?  It feels like weak writing.<br /><br />Baldacci is not one to read if you're looking for something sophisticated, but many of his novels are much more plausible and enjoyable (the one with the character John Pullman, and the King & Maxwell series, especially).<br /><br />Avoid this one.<br /><br />Finally- and this is me being picky- law firms don't waste outer office space (and I think it was even a corner) on a library.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you liked all the individual movies prior to this.  You will love this movie.  All characters at the same time.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|I love this album. Elton John is one of my favorite musicians/singers of all time and this album ranks up there with some of his best ever. The more I listen to it the more I love it. It is amazing to me how quickly he and Bernie Taupin can create great songs. I think this one is deserving of a long denied Grammy. It is ludicrous that he has never won one when you think about all of his contributions to the music world and the pop/rock genre.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|There is non stop action from the strat to the end.  You are always trying to guess what will happen next.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Best show on TV and season 3 is action packed, and the F/X work just continues to raise the bar!
B00BB8UJKG|3.0|Three guys who are having a hard time &#34;settling&#34; for the wonderful women that are in their lives. All three keep looking for &#34;better&#34; some smarten up, some don't
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I thought the music, the storyline and the drama were riveting...what a great piece of work...I wish I could actually watch the entire musical!! someone should run with this one and make it big...sorry to see it go
B004EPYZZ8|3.0|\\"Soul Surfer\\" (2011) relays the inspirational true story of 13 year-old surfer Bethany who's arm was bitten off by a shark in Hawaii in October, 2003. Despite this, she was back in the water surfing in less than a month (!).<br /><br />I admit that my wife & I cried at certain points during this movie, which is  a good testimony, but I felt the movie was sometimes too stagy and awkward, not all the time, but here and there, like the ending where a certain character has a sudden change of heart. People have changes of heart in real life, so I'm not objecting to that, but rather the awkward and questionable way in which it was portrayed. This was a key climatic scene and the filmmakers needed to take the time to do it right, even if it took more time, practice, re-shoots, money or what have you; but it's like they shot it and said, \\"Well, it's not very good, but we'll try to make it work in the editing room\\".<br /><br />About Bethany's nemesis, I liked the way Bethany took her continuing rivalry: She observed, \\"At least she views me as competition\\" as opposed to those who essentially viewed her with pity.<br /><br />Despite the occasional stagy awkwardness, there's enough good here for me to give the film an okay rating, like Bethany & Alana and their relationship (played by cuties AnnaSophia Robb & Lorraine Nicholson, Jack's daughter), the awe-inspiring Hawaiian locations, solid performances by Helen Hunt & others (Dennis Quaid, Kevin Sorbo, Craig T. Nelson and Carrie Underwood), the music, the entire shark attack & aftermath sequence and, of course, the inspirational true story itself.<br /><br />But those stagy, awkward moments are really detrimental. Too bad they didn't take the time to work out the kinks.<br /><br />To view a similar inspirational coming-of-age surfing film that's done more effectively, check out 2010's \\"[[ASIN:B004VRK49K Cutback]]\\". It's a low-budget independent flick, but very good.<br /><br />The film was shot in Hawaii and runs 106 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: Cr /><br />GRADE: C
B00ALGW286|5.0|I'm a better person for having known Marina. She is intelligent, sensitive, honest and passionate and I hope I can meet her someday. But I can't actually meet her in real life. She only exists in this wonderful story. She comes to life with such honesty, I feel like I know her. We see what she sees and feel what she feels. We witness a wonderful and terrifying world through her eyes. Marina comes of age just as her country comes of age, growing from adolescence to adulthood just as the old Soviet Union follows the same path.<br /><br />While reading this wonderful story, I felt the growing pains of a young woman and a nation. Marina's country learns that there is a price to pay for freedom. With freedom comes greed and the darker side of humankind. But Marina's wise grandmother reminds her that greed has always existed. It took on a different form in the lust for power but the end result was the same. People sometimes do evil things to get what they want.<br /><br />As a nation goes through a metamorphosis more dramatic than a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, Marina transforms into a young woman. We feel the first traces of new and unusual feelings as Marina experiences them. It begins with just a concern for an outspoken classmate. He may have crossed the line speaking out against the old hard line of the communist party. We are concerned for Nikolai. He is passionate and honest and we don't want him to get in trouble. Concern turns to respect and then friendship and then something else.<br /><br />But Marina knows she needs to stay focused on her schoolwork if she is going to fulfill her dream. Her dream is to have a job that offers her the ability to travel; just like her father. She knows she needs to devote her time to her studies and yet we feel these other emotions pulling Marina away from her studies and toward something else; love.<br /><br />I highly recommend taking this journey to charming Moscow, Leningrad and the beautiful beaches of the Black Sea. It may even remind you of the first time you fell in love.
B008Y212PI|5.0|my daughter and I enjoy challenging each other.  definetly rate this a 5 out of 5.  am going to search for similar games.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|Its a good series, lost track of it years ago.  Gave me a good show to watch while my foot was healing.
B00DW36G32|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was action packed from beginning to end.  Travolta's character was very believable.  I would recommend this movie.
B00993I6D2|5.0|reminder of how accurate huxley was. grim, but great prophecy of where our government is headed. believable interpretation of huxley's novel
B0093QE37S|5.0|All 3 of my favorites are in this movie! Cary, Audrey and Jimmie. What a great movie never get tired watching it. you will not go wrong for the dry humor in the film is timeless.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|The movie was in Excelent Condition- We watched it over & over  as soon as it got here!!! And the shipping was quick-nothing to complain about.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book - fast paced and interesting characters.  Lots of '80s nostalgia for those of us who grew up in that decade.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I bought this set for my husband this past Father's Day and he loves it. He spent the next three weeks watching and re-watching every movie in the series with our 8-year old son (we did have to fast forward through a few scenes that were especially violent).<br /><br />I also purchased the Star Trek Next Generation Motion Picture Collection, and the two newest Star Trek movies, which are actually pre-quels. The newest movies are his favorites, but he has really enjoyed having the entire collection and I'm sure these are movies he will enjoy watching again and again. He's already watched all of them at least twice, some already three times - and we've only had them a few months!  If you or someone you love is a Star Trek fan - I'd say this is a pretty sure bet!
B0010X745K|5.0|I loaned this movie out and &#34;in case&#34; its not returned, thought I'd buy another one.  I read that Stephen King liked the movie ending better than his book ending.  I read his book --- he's right!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband this past Father's Day. I also got him the first Star-Trek pre-quel (&#34;Star Trek&#34;) and both the Original Star Trek and the Star Trek Next Generation Motion Picture Collections.<br /><br />I think this was probably one of his favorite Father's Day gifts ever! He spent the next three weeks watching and re-watching every movie in the series with our 8-year old son (though we did have to fast forward through a few scenes that were especially violent).  Since this movie wasn't released on DVD until September, he also had something to look forward to once he'd finished all the other Star Trek movies.<br /><br />The newer movies (this one and Star-Trek) are his favorites, but he has really enjoyed having the entire collection and I'm sure these are movies he will enjoy watching again and again. He's already watched all of them at least twice, some three times - and we've only had them a few months!<br /><br />If you or someone you love is a Star Trek fan - I'd say this is a pretty sure bet!
B006G0FSIM|5.0|My husband and I saw this on TV one night and loved it.  He listens to the Phantom of the Opera CD when he walks the treadmill.  So..... he's going to get this CD and microwave popcorn as one of his Christmas gifts.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Having a touchscreen phone,  SwiftKey allows for no other option as a keyboard,  that's how good it is. Predictions based on how you type only get better the more you use it.
B00C5R8364|5.0|This story is so timely there was a story in the paper that was about the same Somalia kidnappers, ransom, the factions in the Muslim world. Great read. Very true to life.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love a challenge with hidden object games and this one certainly hasn't disappointed me. One of the better h.o. games for kindle fire I've found.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|I do not really watch horror movies. I am glad I watched this one. Usually, I wind up laughing during horror movies, but not this flick. I was chilled, thrilled, and rubbing the hair standing up on the back of my neck.
1575666286|5.0|Gerson therapy is working for me! Been feeling weak with bone/body aches for two years, was getting worse, and doctors can't figure out the problem. I started feeling better after a few days Gerson program and I am drinking less than 13 juices per day. Juicing with Champion juicer and a juice press. Thank you God for letting me know about this treatment!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Great! Way Better than the Robert Redford Version! Typical Baz Luhrman style film and stayed true to book. Would highly recommend this film!
B0088P2A7A|4.0|This is a good portal to Wikipedia for a small screen.  This is a very useful app for looking up articles.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very good movie for the entire family lots of action from the beginning, has all the super heroes you want to see.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a very readable book but I felt like the plot was somewhat unrealistic and unlikely. I also don't like it when there are factors affecting the story that are added as an afterthought later in the narrative. The reader is given the best experience when they are given the opportunity to anticipate turns and twists.
B00BE97ONM|1.0|I should have read the sample.  If I had I would not have purchased this because after reading the sex scene I deleted the book from my Kindle.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Stephen King's imagery,and brilliant writing style help to redeem what was in my opinion, a far-fetched plot. To me, something that could really happen is so much more frightening than total fantasy. The book was engaging, but I found the &#34;True Knot&#34; people to be annoying rather than  paralyzing. Vagabonds in expensive RVs that live forever? With endless financing? Ugh.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I was very disappointed with the book.It was very boring!<br />This is the first time ever that the tv series was bettter than the book.<br />I bought it to read because I couldn't wait to see what happened after the series ended and it wasn' event in the book. In fact lots of situations were  left out of the book.
0684857219|5.0|Full of all kinds of useful info for all levels of training from head to toe!  Well worth buying this book.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|If you enjoy knights in shining armor, plots that just continues to surprise, characters that you love and hate, and never forget the Dragons. All in all just a bloody good read, now waiting on book 6.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|If you like music.  If you like a little history of music.  If you like to know a little about making a record, this movie is for you.  I really enjoyed the movie.  It's an homage to the studio Sound City where Nirvana recorded their break through album.  Many different artists, producers, engineers talk about what it was like to work at Sound City and what made it so great.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|This is the way I always thought that the law was practiced...lying, cheating, and bluffing. Well produced, great camera etc.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|HAYNES has managed to capture the insanity of domestic violence while delivering a fast paced credible suspense novel. While I wish the end had been more realistic, I would highly recommend this read of an emerging artist.  The symptoms of experience are real for those who might question some of it. While at times exaggerated in this book, they actually exist and influence victims in subtle ways of self-sabotage. She has done an excellent job of bringing them to the fore and keeping the story real. A must read for everyone in the business.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I would get this game, but after severely attempts to download it wouldn't. Don't get if you have a kindle.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|During pilot episode, Dr. Rudy Wells saw Steve Austin went for walk.  Steve flew NASA aircraft and then he was in danger of flying.  He said,  &#34;Flight com, I can't hold it! She's breaking up! She's breaking up!&#34; and then NASA aircraft was being crashed and exploded and burned.  Steve was being rushed to the hospital losing his left eye, right arm, and both legs.  Dr. Rudy Wells and bionic crew rebuilding the man.  Oscar Goldman said, &#34;Gentlemen,  we can rebuild him.  We have the technology.  We are capable of making the world's first bionic man.  Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before.  Better,  Stronger,  and Faster.&#34;  Steve uses his bionic eye vision to see anything.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It  is good puzzle game if your bored and like puzzles I love th  ham  I play it all of the time I like it
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This gives you your current weather instantly.  Then when you tap on forecast, you get the weeks weather at a glance.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If your looking for a  scientific view of life after death this is the book to read!  It is a journey that we each must make  someday.  This book will sooth the soul and bring happiness and comfort to anyone who reads it. Every NDE that I have read has one thing in common, love.  The unconditional love of God for his children. This book also recognized the bond between each of us as spirits.  I would highly recommend it to others who want to know what happens when we leave mortality.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought 2 Lego Minecraft kits plus Tshirt for Christmas for grandson (9) who is just beginning to explore the worlds of Minecraft

B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Minecraft video games and Lego products are a favorite of my grandson. This will provide a great Christmas present and lasting fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool that I was happy it was free.cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool  maybe u should make another game which I hope I will be the first to get and because off this I should  get a discount on this game(half price).
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is a terrific read. Lots of history and laughs,well written and an easy read. this is a book to recommend to most people
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun to play but the game ended too soon.  Not much challenge, but entertaining for as long as it lasted.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is a truly heart felt story for anyone who has come in touch with those suffering from Asbergers and the like it is a must .Plus a very funny read with a more serious side.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|The Buddha has spent the last 40 years doing demolition in Detroit.  The amazing grace of this man and his modesty and wisdom moved me profoundly.  I would bet there are a thousand singer-songwriters with similar stories of possibility and disappointment, but would they calmly accept sudden acclaim and recognition as Rodriguez ?  I encourage you to watch this and think about it.<br /><br />All props to Malik Bendjelloul for seeing and making manifest a story that is truly universal in the truths and the love at its core.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|Great video, great sound, Blackmore sounds great. What more is there. Get it if your into Rainbow or Deep Purple
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I also read this based on Robin Hobb's recommendation (as well as a 'real-life' friend) I was surprised how much I liked it. I couldn't put it down (i.e. I read it during the day and not just in bed!) In retrospect I could find things that weren't 5 star worthy but while reading it, I really didn't miss those things because I was quite caught up in the world so 4 stars from me :D
B00BI745AA|3.0|This title was worth renting; however, not worth buying in my opinion.  Your mileage may vary. Blah, blah, blah, etc.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My 21 month old daughter loves this show! She always asks for &#34;sheep&#34;. I think it's really cute and like that it has no dialogue.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|This title was worth renting; however, not worth buying in my opinion.  Your mileage may vary. Blah, blah, blah, etc.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|You'll giggle, you'll cry, you'll love every page of this adorable, sweet, real, heartbreaking book. Beautifully written, the author has a real knack for making you feel every emotion felt by Eleanor and Park.....and isn't that what good writing is all about? I wish I could give it more stars.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|This title was worth renting; however, not worth buying in my opinion.  Your mileage may vary. Blah, blah, blah, etc.
B005544V6A|4.0|Smart and entertaining. A little formulaic but witty.  I started watching it and couldn't stop until I got through the first season.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg I love it. I cant stop playing it's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you need a game that would entertain you this is it!!!!!!!!!
B000001FDK|5.0|Love love love Grease. I forgot how much until I bought the soundtrack (originally bought for my wedding). I used it so I could have &#34;You're the one that I want&#34; to walk back out to. Then I caught myself listening to it in the car. Shipped fast, also!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it. Keep it coming. Cant wait for season four.  I give it 5 stars anyday. Love the drama a lot
B005P06AAO|5.0|If you haven't seen this show, then you are missing out! I'm in love! The first season is the best, yet. The new season (Season 4) come on October 22nd! Don't miss out!
B005LJITS0|2.0|We were very disappointed in this movie. The language was foul for what should be a 'family' movie and the audio was horrible.<br />It was like a cheaply made movie.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I never thought this game would be so cool until my brother bought it and I downloaded it and it was 1 of the best games I've ever played. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
B003B02O0A|5.0|I got this as a re-read for his sequel coming later this month.  Always love Grisham.  Also loved the movie.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults.  It will make you laugh, cry, and be on the edge of your seat.  Very funny, and will keep you entertained from beginning to end.  Highly recommend for everyone...has a good message as well.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A great story/plot.  I read them right through.  I look forward to the 3rd book coming out hopefully soon. Would have made a great m/m book as well, but is not.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Fast delivery and well packaged. Good movie to watch. I like the option of having both blue ray and a regular DVD so I can watch this movie on either and I can loan it out to friends who do not have blue ray.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A great story/plot.  I read them right through.  I look forward to the 3rd book coming out hopefully soon. Would have made a great m/m book as well, but is not.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Fast Delivery and I love watching this series. I would much rather get the whole season and watch them at my own pace with out having to wait and watch it every week on tv. Great loaner to friends too.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Every song on this album is good, and several are very good.  Another great effort from Daughtry, and I would highly recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is perfect for all ages. Easy to play.  You can build your world fairly quickly and it has fun mini games.
1433502399|4.0|The notes, maps, pictures and diagrams are useful for Bible Study and the only other ESV version of the Bible I had was basic. The graphics are helpful in understanding some of the contexts of passages. The print is in a readable size.  I gave this Bible a 4 star rating because it is heavy to carry.  I enjoy reading this Bible as a parallel to other versions and in comparing the word translations.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Well written book about a sensitive issue.  While I loved the book, I am still troubled by the ending, but it makes for great discussion.
0553801473|2.0|I'm almost done with this book and I'm growing pretty annoyed/frustrated but I do think it's an improvement on Book 4 (which I'll review separately) but it suffers from so much fragmentation of the story and characters that I have grown really frustrated reading this book. I don't want to assume that a lot of this is added \\"filler\\" to stretch the series out but it's very hard for me to stay excited about this series as books 4 and 5 have really dragged.<br /><br />This book barely moves the main story and core characters ahead. There are a couple chapters each of what I consider the core characters although Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys do get a little more attention than the rest (Bran, Arya, Jamie and Cersei, what I consider core characters). The rest of the book has a hodge podge of supporting cast, Asha Greyjoy, Victarion, Barriston Selmy, Jon Currington (connington? cant remember).<br /><br />And throughout the hodge podge chapters I keep asking myself \\"why do I care about this character?? I don't need to hear a whole chapter on what's going on in Asha or Barristions world. Or at least, not at the expense of hearing more about Arya, Jamie or Bran. I find myself tuning out completely during some chapters just waiting to move on to one that actually gets back to the core part of the story. The easiest way for me to describe it is there is a lot in this book that when the HBO show gets here, they'll probably just skip it and trim out a lot of these characters, otherwise watch the viewers drop like flies. :)<br /><br />The other thing that's driving me crazy about this book, and it started in the last book, is the chapters starting with nicknames or pseudonyms of the actual character! I don't know if the thinking was to give a little perspective on where the characters current mindset is or what but I hate spending the first bit of a chapter wondering who the heck the POV character is. OR maybe it's a new character! One example is Theon. There are some chapters from Reek and some from Theon. Ok, I get that, maybe this is to help the reader feel the progression of Reek feeling like \\"Theon\\" again. But then it gets worse. Check out this list:<br /><br />46.  THE BLIND GIRL<br />71.  THE QUEEN'S HAND<br />69.  THE DRAGONTAMER<br />68.  THE KINGBREAKER<br />65.  THE UGLY LITTLE GIRL<br />63.  THE SACRIFICE<br />62.  THE GRIFFIN REBORN<br />61.  THE SPURNED SUITOR<br />60.  THE DISCARDED KNIGHT<br />57.  THE IRON SUITOR<br />56.  THE QUEENSGUARD<br />47.  A GHOST IN WINTERFELL<br />43.  THE KING'S PRIZE<br />42.  THE TURNCLOAK<br />39.  THE WATCHER<br />38.  THE PRINCE OF WINTERFELL<br />27.  THE WAYWARD BRIDE<br />26.  THE WINDBLOWN<br />25.  THE LOST LORD<br /><br />You get the idea. I don't know how this seemed like a great idea but he gets so carried away with it in this book that as I reach the end I'm completely annoyed with this approach. It also further illustrates how fragmented the story is getting when over half the book is devoted to this smattering of side characters. Seriously annoying.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm going to finish this book since there are only a few chapters to go but I'm going to be pretty skeptical about reading any further books. I may just wait for the HBO seasons and enjoy how they \\"clean\\" things up, which I'm sure they will.<br /><br />On the flip side, if you're really into lots of detail and side stories and want this story to move as slowly as possible because you love everything about it and want to milk every ounce of detail out of the world and the characters, then this book might be for you.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|The Amazing Spider-Man is an overall great game.<br /><br /> PROS: It has spectacular graphics and smooth controls and game play.  It doesn't get old easily, with plenty of things to do.  You not only have missions that follow a good storyline but you can also free roam.  There are plenty of side missions and  to fights to keep you entertained.<br /><br />CONS: It can glitch and freeze.  On a certain mission it freezes my Kindle Fire HD and then crashes.  Sometimes it will freeze on the homepage and even when I exit the app, continue to play music until I shut down my device.<br /><br />I love this game and have spent time and money on it.  Please fix the crashes and glitches.  If not for those, I would easily give this game ten stars.  Overall I am glad I bought it, and I hope that they come out with an update that will fix its problems.  Thank you for reading my review and I hope it helps.
055358202X|2.0|After book 3 I was very excited for this book and after reading a lot of the reviews I was hesitant but decided to give it a shot anyway. Unfortunately most of the reviews are spot on. First off, some of the biggest characters in the story don't even make an appearance in this book. New, less important characters are introduced and basically end up feeling like filler between chapters until we get back to the main characters.<br /><br />I'll keep it short and sweet because all the other reviewers have already covered this but this book moves slowly and feels like filler and some of the main characters, and favorites for that matter, don't even make an appearance. I can barely remember what happened in this book to be honest. Books 1-3 I remember vividly.<br /><br />So there you go.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|There was an excellent story line, but I did not like the way sex was presented, especially the lesbian aspect.  In fact, I stopped watching it for for while because of this.  I would not recommend it.
1449410243|1.0|Cute book. Humorous insights on cats. Would have been better without the the profanity, censored and uncensored. I bought this for my 12 year old son...he pointed out the language. At least I know I'm raising him well.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I've really enjoyed all the games from G5 so far.  Great graphics and entertaining.  Definitely keeps you wanting to play the games and unlock the mystery behind each one.

0307271609|5.0|Empress Dowager CIXI was one of the more amazing and accomplished women (or men) during the period (mid-19th century) when she ruled and opened China to the world. Born of a courtly family, granted some education, she was chosen as a concubine for the Emperor during his regular searches for more and younger women. This could have been, and was, a very sad end to so many of the young women chosen for this \\"honor\\". However, Empress Cixi took what she was given and wove strands of pure gold. She established a cordial relationship with the actual Empress, bore a son by the Emperor, and proceeded to educate herself to a very high standard indeed.<br /><br />At the time, almost everyone in China was illiterate, there were no science or technical universities, and the French, along with the British were making very successful land-grabbing attempts against the territories of China. After the death of the Emperor, CIXI accomplished something never before seen, she rid herself of the Regency, designed to rule until  her son came of age, and set herself, and the official Empress up as the real rulers of China. Of course, in actuality, this meant that the Dowager Empress CIXI ruled China.<br /><br />She was a brilliant and far-sighted women, arranging for Westerners to teach the Sciences in her Chinese universities, locating an honest Englishman to handle the collection of import duties at the new, and thriving port of Shanghai, and generally importing the Western ways that she deemed to be of importance, into China.<br /><br />Suddenly, one heir dies, not to worry, another (from her family) is appointed, Cixi has periods in power, and out of power, but this brilliant woman manages to modernize China, and to give China a place in the global community. She trained Chinese diplomats, with the first diplomat from China to the West being a Westerner, a very well-chosen and ethical man. Her brilliance never ceases to amaze (and to irritate) those around her. But, she does drag China into a modern world which it would never other wise have reached.<br /><br />Eventually, at quite an advanced age, it was time for yet another Emperor to be chosen, he was not up to the job, and CIXI did not live long enough to assist him. For more info. on this point in China's history, please watch \\"The Last Emperor\\". stunningly presented by Bernardo Bertulucci on DVD. This book was extremely fascinating, I could have written many more review pages about this woman, and the evolving China of her time.<br /><br />Please do read this book, it is filled with information newly-gleaned from the archives of China. Then, for the entire visual experience, view \\"The Last Emperor\\". For an excellent film documenting the fall of China (Shanghai) to the Japanese, I highly recommend \\"The Empire of the Sun\\", starring a very young Christian Bale, in addition to John Malkovich. This move represents the fall of colonial China,and the strategy that the Japanese practiced upon the Chinese, and available Westerners.<br />If you real this book, and watch the 2 movies, you will be moved beyond belief by the emergence, and that fall of this lovely country. Were more people to read and explore the history of China, our future relationship with China might be rendered that much comprehensible.<br /><br /> The same author : Jung Chang, wrote 2 other fascinating books about aspects of Chinese life : \\"MAO\\". and : \\"Wild Swans\\". Jung Chang possesses a stunning new talent, and one which can not be praised enough for its importance to the Western World.a into a modern world which it would never other wise have reached.<br /><br />Eventually, at quite an advanced age, it was time for yet another Emperor to be chosen, he was not up to the job, and CIXI did not live long enough to assist him.

B007EC27QM|5.0|Having had way to many years in the computer industry, having started out as a condescending unix user, then onto PC's , and finally retired and usually just grab my tablet to use, I can state how nice it is to have an app that acts as advertised and has yet to crash. I wouldn't hesitate to go with this app again. Thanks Digitalchemy.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Must have for any WH fan!<br />Just love it...and listen it very, very often! True legend and her music lives on...
B00138KCTW|4.0|Overall this album is pretty good, but some tracks are somewhat dependent on taste and it doesn't have a very consistent feel. Some tracks are very downtempo while others are quite a bit quicker and funkier. I guess the best way to put it is that it will probably have something that appeals to everyone, or work well for someone who has one album to fit multiple moods...but it might not be an album where you enjoy the whole thing together.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Overall, this is an enormous improvement over the initial release. Why, because it's as if they went back into the studio and re-recorded the whole thing they way they really want it to be after listening to it themselves and re-thinking it. Sometimes, Alex's guitar drops back and mixes in with everything, when I really liked it up-front and loud. Other tracks the recording just sounds more interesting and perfect. I like both versions for different reasons. The initial release had that garage band raw feel (I love grudge), while the second version feels polished and garnished (which appeals to my younger self that was into Yes, studio ELP, and Genesis).
B0083Z614S|4.0|It is easy to see why this book has been popular for so many years.  The reader experiences transformations of  characters through the healing powers of nature and good hearted peers. The dialect makes for fun reading.
B003L77G6K|4.0|I love this show had no problems with the Blu-ray......only wish the cover was taken care of better.....im picky like that but I don't know if it was the shipping that damaged the package or if it was sent out like that.....if walmart can do better I think that speaks volumes.....
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great for streaming with the couple supported services, and works pretty well for tab sharing, I just wish I could share my full screen on it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|So cool!I love that you can change the outfit.Before you didn't do that.<br />But adds come up constantly. So a annoying.<br />But this game is still pretty good.I would buy it if I were you.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Oren knows his stuff. This book is a practical approach to getting what you want, when and how you want it. Certainly needs to be listed with other great business books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really loved this book. It's an inspiration an  it reminds you that things are okay even when they're not. It has to be an all time favorite of mine. Absolutely loved
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great way to pass time. Fun for all ages!! Recommended to friends and family. Wish the levels were a little more colorful.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Has some glitches but it's all good. Money needs to be given quicker but if that was the case how would they make money. Lol
0345803485|1.0|Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik &#34;Chava&#34;: No, I didn't finish it, it's 'intended trash' by the way - but I sure as hell paid for the electronic version. Doesn't anyone understand that THIS IS A SATIRE for the most part? The writer is BRITISH? The joke is on those who think this is completely serious. This writer is grinning secretly all the way to the bank and I venture to accuse her of knowing exactly what ruse she was pulling on America, the intended target. I assume any better-educated English writer would have intended the satire because it's not their instinct to write cheap Harlequin romance X-rated novels and take it seriously (with a woman who has ceaseless climaxes per hour). AND - no guy is THAT good looking to cause her to do so unless she received a teaspoon of Spanish Fly in her Royal Doulton tea cup. Evidently, historically, he was traumatized via his seduction by a latter-day version of a lascivious oldish bat from today's Cougar Life. Ridiculous!<br /><br />If you have to make a movie of this farce, I VOTE FOR GILBERT GOTTFRIED for the lead role in the movie version, because it is a satire, number one. As for the consideration of RYAN GOSLING for the part, he is actually a regular guy, not great looking and boring as hell - I do not see the attraction to him, that's another rant of mine. Charlie Hunnam is British, and I can certainly see the attraction to him. I bet he backed out, because he knows what I know. He doesn't want to wait for folks to wake up and realize they didn't catch on to the joke early so he'll be blamed.<br /><br />Read some classics folks - learn what good literature is please. Such as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or 'Moby Dick' (no pun intended), also 'Crime and Punishment' by Dostovesky (again, no pun intended). And if you like bondage, try 'Of Human Bondage' by Maugham (that was intended).
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is a challenging game and keeps your mind working. I really enjoy it. I recommend this game to anyone who really wants to keep there minds sharp.
B009JZWWGC|4.0|Excellent video product.  Streamed without any issues or glitches during movie.  The above statement is for the product itself and not the content.  Content is entirely too subjective to rate.
B006Q2LTRO|5.0|excellent book I learned alot of things I didn't know! it is preparing me  and my fiance for a healthy marriage!
B00782O7IY|4.0|The DVD came promptly and I enjoyed watching this movie.  I can now see why the film receved an Oscar.
B0093ST02E|2.0|It wasn't very entertaining.  In fact we didn't bother to finish watching the film and it was so unremarkable that only a couple of days later when we were asked to review it we couldn't remember anything about it.
0385345054|5.0|Do not hesitate to buy this book. Stunningly photographed with step by step instructions and templates. It is so sumptuous and inspiring - a bargain at twice the price
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Nesbo is a terrific writer. I have been engrossed in his  twisting mysteries since we lost Steig Larsen.  His Harry Hole lead character is a fascinating mess of a man. Great series.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This book of fiction kept my interest. It follows a young girl who was left orphaned in life. The story has some historical significance as there really were orphan trains back in the day. I would recommend this novel for anyone who enjoys works of fiction.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I like the mixture of history and fictional story, was a great read will have to get the next book.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This was a very good read. I love her style, particularly with the fic premise alongside her story. Would definitely recommend this book to a friend.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Once the action moves to Canada, nothing much happens until the end of the book and at that point you're asking the question,&#34;Was it worth plowing through all those pages just to get here? I don't know what the Pulitzer prize committee was thinking about.
B00FDSUJ0A|4.0|New Panic! goes back to their roots of electronic pop. The only difference between their very first album and this one, is that there are more unique songs as you listen through the cd. Less dancy electronic music and more &#34;dark&#34; lyrics. Worth a purchase if you are a long time fan.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love watching these episodes when there's nothing on TV worth watching.  All disks  were  in excellent condition. I thought the price was reasonable.
B0015AARJI|4.0|very nice feel, and as expected very responsive like a new controller should be. package came in an open box but so far no probs
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This was an excellent book. I loved all of the main characters. Murder, mystery and romance were all rolled up into a very entertaining story. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a well-written and exciting book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The costumes and furnishings are so fun to watch.....imagine living like that....OMG!!<br />Also the way they show the poor and how they live and talk and then the same show it changes to the castle and how they live.......amazing. I will be watching every season to come.
B00C2C637I|4.0|The plot moves along slowly at times, but the descriptions and the mood set by this book will stay with the reader long after the last page has been turned.  It is another reminder of why Ray Bradbury is an icon among science fiction writers.
1452113432|5.0|This book is beautiful and artful in content and design. The recipes are authenic and captured delectably in photos. It gives the reader a visual peek at the nocks and crannies of Paris...love this book!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game to play but wished would give more daily to play with especially since most roomstakemore than get for day
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I watched this season to prepare myself for the new 24 !  It is coming soon, get ready. I believe it will be as good as or better thanRedemption
1476727651|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but like all prolific writers some of his works are better than others.  When I started this one I didn't think I was going to like it; the scene with Deenie kind of put me off.  Then, as the story unfolded I became more and more caught up in it.  I really loved Abra.  I hope the door remains open to hear more of her in the future.<br />Toward the end I found myself almost skimming in my eagerness to fine out what happened, so I guess I wall have to read it again in a week or two just to pick up all the details that I blew past.<br />It helps if you've read \\"The Shining\\", but it would not be incomprehensible to someone who hasn't.  I recommend it to new King readers and old fans alike!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's so cool its awesome as you can we could play a nightmare on elm street in jail for girls are some ways people study the little mermaids salon and I have been sending u too long ago by scott o dell book summary judgment of a wimpy kid wiz
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Finally, a series on commercial TV worth watching. I'm hooked and starting Season 4. Great stories and a great cast.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|Great movie to experience as we are nearing Halloween!  Over the top blood & guts... Great special effects -- I hope they were special effects!!!!  RRR
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP! I was able to change a stack of one diamond to a stack of 255!<br />and I was able to change from survival to creative. I was also able to get unlimited health. I could also teleport back to spawn. And I could get a stack of 255 diamond<br />hats,a stack of 255 diamonds boots,255 diamond pants,and 255 diamond shirts then I could almost have unlimited armor.
B00ECLTYOG|2.0|Sad because the first two were epic... This was a waste of money. Seriously wait for it on HBO and you'll see how bad it is
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Was pretty decent but I got billed for it twice&#60; It was different and had a surprise ending. Would reccommend
0823015033|5.0|One of the best polymer clay books in my collection.  Lots of new techniques and information.  Excellent photography.  Lots of new ideas.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is a gem of a book. Buy it, read it and enjoy. It not only has exciting suspense, it also has a lot of insight into the various kinds of people who live in Bombay as well as interesting thoughts on the ideas of freedom, redemption & forgiveness.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Although it was a good read at some points most of it was just too hard to believe.Either the cops in Atlanta are the most stupidest in the world or the author just doesn't know how a police investgation works.Characters were flat with no development.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is not your usual Grisham book. Humorous, entertaining and believable. A good ending as well, leaving you thinking about how the sequel might go.
B00785P2QC|5.0|From my son: I love this game and I like it! ( he's 6 ) I can't stop playing it. I like the cars and mommy can play it with me too. I like the buildings and the garbage trucks. I get to run a whole city!
B005V5WBFG|3.0|When I paid for the mobile security through McAfee, it gave me a \\"link\\" to get the app and connect to my Kindle Fire HD. That link directed me back to Amazon to get the free trial, which I downloaded. Now my 30 day free trial is up, and it won't allow me to connect to my paid subscription. It says I need a longer subscription key which is at least 11 digits long, but the password they gave me is 6 digits. Now I have paid for nothing that works on my Kindle. I have contacted McAfee's customer service, but haven't heard back from them yet.<br /><br />10/17/13 After contacting McAfee directly, and waiting until the free subscription ran out and removed from Kindle, was able to connect to my Kindle from the web page through the links in the Kindle, so revised the stars up to 3. Program seems to work OK, but it shouldn't be that hard to connect.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Everything was great. The discs are all scratch-free (that doesn't always happen anymore), the episodes are re-mastered and look great, and love the new effects (I know the set is several years old already but I'd never seen the remastered episodes before now). About the only fault I have noticed is a minor one; each episode you play on a disc after the first time the disc is inserted has a few seconds delay in loading. Oher than that they're flawless.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love the game. Played on a friends IPad first and was excited to see if it was available on my kindle fire  Just wish it weren't so addictive!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is so fun! Most of the emoji  questions are not that hard. If you get this app you will love it. I hope you love it and have as much fun with it as much as me.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Good story, but the movie is not as engaging. Hard to figure out the relationship between each scene, or to have a suspense that keeps you intrigued.
B00BXDOSXS|3.0|It does what it should, which is list the videos on your device. But I wish it had more features, like changing viewing orientation.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have them all great show ,my items arrived on time with no problems and I was pleased with purchase would order again.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|we read this book for our book club.  The first half of book dragged a bit.  It got more interesting once she got steady work on SNL.<br />Nice to hear that SNL had a lot of women in their cast over the years, and how much influence they had.
B004J4WL50|5.0|Absolutely what I needed to hear. A conscious take on creating a business and a blending of profit, creativity and a non profit ideology.
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|SPOILER ALERT:  I must admit, science fiction is not my usual reading fare.  I found Oryx and Crake years ago on a \\"staff recommends\\" table at a book store and was intrigued.  I read and loved the book.  I was irritated that I hadn't taken note it was book one in a trilogy, but now, I was in it.  I immediately bought and read Year of the Flood. Then, I waited and waited for the third book.  I was so excited when I heard it was coming out this September.  Since it had been too long since I'd read Oryx and Crake and Year of the Flood, I reread them both immediately before beginning MaddAddam, which I just finished last night.  I still love Oryx and Crake and find it by far the best of the three books.  Year of the Flood, with all the new characters and God's Gardeners hymns took some time for me to warm up to, but I did ultimately enjoy it.  MaddAddam just left me disappointed.  It lacked much of the wit and writing style I've so enjoyed in other Atwood books.  The Craker storytelling device was overused.  I understood when I reached the end of the book why, but that didn't help because the end of the book made me feel like Atwood just ran out of steam and interest in her own created world and characters and was looking for a quick and dirty way to end it all.  It fizzled out instead of going out with the big bang I was expecting.  I didn't like what happened with Zeb at the end -- we are to believe there were other humans still making their way in this world, and everyone just obliterated each other?  Why the rush to that conclusion?  And Atwood threw up some interesting questions, none of which will ever be resolved.  Do the half human/half Craker children have built in insect repellant, do they purr, do they sing?  Or are they more human?  We'll never know anything about them and whether the world is set to repeat itself or Crake actually pulled off his intended feat.  I didn't like Amanda and Ren being relegated the way they were, especially the feisty Amanda.  Idid enjoy the Zeb back story, and that he opened up to Toby and they found true love and happiness together.  The pigoon thing didn't appeal to me, especially because there was no explanation as to how Blackbeard or any other Craker could communicate with them.  They weren't designed to eat animals, but there was no design to make them kindred and able to communicate with animals.  I have a friend who read books one and two as well, I'm not so sure I'll encourage her to complete the trilogy.  To me, it detracted from the wonders of Oryx and Crake.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|I enjoy the story line and character development.  Recommended series.  Very much looking forward to the next season. Thank you
B00EEXST2K|3.0|Maybe it was my mood, but I did not enjoy this film all that much. I watch some movies more than one time over the years, but Lovelace is a one time viewing.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Excellent story.  A mercenary becomes a Christian and a Jesuit.  Priests endure hardships to pastor a large group of natives.  A Catholic official from Europe comes to decide whether to allow the destruction of their mission and allow the natives to be captured as slaves to rich farmers, or keep them protected.  He, of course, elects to do the political thing &#34;To preserve the Church&#34; and allows the priests and many natives to be killed and the mission burned.<br />Illustrates the difference between Christian faith and Churches.  One obeys God and one seeks political power.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Exciting, suspenseful, graphic and emotional -Breaking Bad is good!  I try to dole out the episodes to enjoy it as long as possible.<br />I think I'm in love with Jesse Pinkman.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|a man's movie with redemtion of a family. you will want to watch it more than once. Great Great Great.

B00656C6KK|2.0|So sad - they sucked us in to buying this with the build up, thinking she had cut this \\"new\\" beautiful CD, when all they did was repackage some old tunes of years past.  I love DD, but I couldn't even give this CD away it was so bad :(
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! I finished the three crossfire books in a few days and am impatiently waiting for the next!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Everyone has difficult times. Everyone needs inspiration. Something to keep them going. This book is an amazing story of exactly that. Highly recommended. You won't regret reading this story.
0553062182|4.0|A very interesting study on the development, experiences and possibly the &#34;joys&#34; of being an Introvert! I found so many wonderful ideas to be proud of that had never entered my mind. Our culture, in the USA, is based on the virtues of being an Extrovert. The author relates stories of introverts, their backgrounds , problems and how to deal with an &#34;insensitive&#34; environment. Some of the technical part was a little beyond my grasp, but, in essence, this book is a wonderful statement on the &#34;positive inner world&#34; of the introvert.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|A modern Dickens saga of fortune seekers in the West Coast goldfields of New Zealand. I was hooked by page 3 and never looked back! Sparkling prose and soulful insights into the characters of ordinary, and yet exceptional people. A masterpiece.
0307887898|5.0|If you manage others, or are involved in product development in any way this is a must read.  I want to apply these principles NOW! Well written, I'd love to see him present this material.
B00A287PG2|3.0|A very interesting account, but rather fragmented, which gives it a feeling of superficiality.  Topics are partially addressed, then dropped and taken back up.  This might work better in the print edition, but on an e-reader it makes the framework of the book extremely difficult to follow.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|My favorite all time Christmas movie! I can watch this movie a million times even though it's not Christmas yet, and my brother loves this movie to its a win win situation
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and Emile Hirsch was wonderful.  Very different but lovely.  Wish the ending could have been different.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Works good on my kindle and is fast paced<br /> Game that is addictive and my grandkids love it as much as the adults in my family
B0018BB20W|5.0|Days Of Future Passed (not 'past') blew me away when I first heard it in 1972. I got into The Moody Blues around the time of A Question Of Balance's release. From there I bought Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, Seventh Sojourn and eventually this one. I now own all of the &#34;classic seven&#34; on vinyl.<br /><br />DOFP was a milestone when it came out in 1967. When I first heard it, Nights In White Satin was a big radio hit which turned me on to this band. When I listened to the album as a whole, I thought I heard the most beautiful piece of music in the world, and that still holds up today. This album is best listened to all at once since it's a concept album. It tells the story of an average day, broke into different parts like dawn, peak hour, twilight time, night, etc. What got me on this album was its heavy orchestration. Although the band wouldn't use orchestras as much later on, I love every album I've heard by them.<br /><br />If you plan on getting into The Moody Blues (you'd be doing yourself a big favor), I'd recommend starting with Days Of Future Passed. This is God's work. A higher power definitely contributed to the making of this one.
B000FBJF3M|4.0|This is a historical novel following Attilius, an engineer who is new to his position and must discover why the waters have stopped flowing to Roman cities near Mount Vesuvius. As he investigates and attempts to repair the problem, he realizes that while nature is conspiring against humanity (with the pending eruption), there are a series of corrupt deals that have led Rome to be blind to the signs of the impending destruction.<br /><br />I enjoyed the historical details--so many references to wealthy Romans lounging in luxury while their slaves tend everything; references to the strange practices of the time; references to Pliny's last days (Pliny is a character in the novel), and political intrigue not dissimilar to some of what we experience today. Just like today, there are few honest men. Attilius is one of them, and in a culture run by money, corruption, and political connections, his honesty is a liability. The details--at once foreign and familiar--made the story for me.<br /><br />The plot picked up as the volcano got closer to erupting (and then continued to do so), though I found the story could have moved faster at times. I also would have liked just a bit more imagery and details from the time period. I was relying on television shows and visits to museums to fuel my mental imagery. Still, it's a great read for those interested in the history of Rome and ancient Roman culture.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|We all need to be aware of our personal calling. A personal calling is the path that God chose for you on earth. When we do anything that fills  us with enthusiasm, we are following our legend.  At times this calling is buried almost invincible, buried in layers of fear, guilt, prejudice.  We need patience and courage and know that the universe is conspiring in our behalf.  Everyone when they are young know that their personal legend is. When you want something its a force that originates in the soul it becomes your mission.  The soul of the world is nourished by peoples happiness.  God has prepared a path for everyone to follow.  You have to read the omens He leaves for you.
0802473156|5.0|IF YOU NEED HELP REALIZING HOW YOU NEED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER THEN THIS IS IT!!!! such an amazing book to help any marriage or any people that are planning on getting married! definitely read this before you do anything! your life will change. Chapman is an amazing author and he puts it in a light that you can understand easily.
0761169253|4.0|This book, as simple as it is, is most likely one of the most accurate books I have read lately.  I really enjoyed it.  Short, sweet and to the point.
0802473164|5.0|Gave to my fiance to read before we got married and he absolutely loved it. Chapman puts things into a guys perspective and that really helped him get into the book. He finally sees where I am coming from!!! Has changed our lives.... I highly recommend it!!!
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|like comic books but more technological<br />lots of action<br />the human interplay developed in next episodes is entertaining<br />fast paced suspend any notion of reality<br />i would watch more
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I've always been a Pink Floyd fan and enjoyed watching them perform some of my favorite songs in concert on the DVD.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I love period shows that give you a hint of how life used to be. Upstairs downstairs has more soap opera feel then Dowton Abbey but still captivating.
B003OFHMKO|3.0|This album fell a bit flat, the rare moments of unaccompanied music were a breath of fresh air, Spalding has a nice voice, but at some points I wanted her to stop interrupting the pleasure and variation that the music itself was creating. This was okay, but I found myself skipping some songs and repeating others, the most enjoyable vocals were little fly and the duet with she and the other female vocalist but other than that no singing, or vocal intonation was necessary. I love Esperanza Spalding for doing different things, and will support her but I'd like to see a fully nuanced chamber music album without singing. Thanks.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Difficult topic to deal with, but the author handled is very well and it seemed like she did a lot of research.  Gave us &#34;food for thought&#34; and we are still discussing the book which is a good sign after it has been finished.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I get in that world and can't get out until the book is finished. This one is a real page-turner for sure!
B0058VW36U|5.0|CUT THE ROPE! But wait...it's not so simple...there are STRINGS attached(pun intended!).That's what makes this game a CUT above the rest.you really must think before you cut and not be STRUNG along. I'm really HUNG up on this great game.It really SWINGS!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At first when I bought this book to read on my Kindle it felt like a gamble. The description didn't sound *that* good, but the ratings were ok... so I went for it.<br /><br />I am glad I did.<br /><br />It's hard to give this saga a short recap and make it representative of the book(s). Thus the title of this review, different in a good way. It takes a short while to move yourself into the world that Howey constructs, but once you're there you get stuck and don't want to leave.<br /><br />This saga has a great depth, characters are acting like real persons, the world seems to move. Even though the setting is quite odd all bits and pieces are well thought through and make sense. I don't think I ever reflected upon a fact and thought that it was dumb or impossible, it's well thought through.<br /><br />This is a book I'd recommend (have done) to readers that aren't used to this genre of books. There are a lot of sci-fi kind of concepts, but those aren't at the forefront, the story is. And the story is great, gripping and really entertaining.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|The best of the best British humor. Those people know how to do it. John Cleese is amazing, the whole cast is amazing. I recommend this one to anyone who enjoys good clean fun! Mossy
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is addicting.  I have had to get on you tube for help a couple times.  It keeps you thinking!
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|Awesome! Love the new album, very catchy and great variety of song types. Panic at the disco continues to evolve
B004SIP9B0|4.0|I liked it very much.  I thought it would be boring because I lived through that time and thought I knew everything that went on but the acting was good and there was a lot of stuff I didn't remember or didn't know.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know what went on behind closed doors when Diana died.  Very enlightening.
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|Where the plot was going was obvious. The ethical tensions were run over at warp speed? Why so flat from such a great writer. This book felt like an after thought
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|I didn't like it because I thought most of it was not believeable.  The story was too far fetched even though it was fiction the story line was way out there.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I normally don't watch this type of movie but enjoyed this one enough to buy a Kindle copy for myself!  The characters are very easy to sympathize with and I love the quality of the digital work.  Very colorful, humorous and imaginative!
B00C7607BC|5.0|A present for the G/F a super fan of all things Disney, especially the Little Mermaid.  The extras make her happy and if you order soon there is some deal where Disney will send you a limited edition poster.
B004GYY714|5.0|The app works great and there is a very large selection of stations from around the world.<br />I would like that all stations publish their playlist, but this is not an issue with the app, I gather.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|Just what I was looking for, great buy! Recommend this to every person trying to save a buck or two!
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Interesting but overrated mini-series, for us, anyway. Okay, but too long drawn out. We think it could have been better. It was interesting, but for us it seemed that the producers obviously tried to go for something too deep. It was interesting as a WWII movie that showed things from this side as opposed to the European side, but overall, way too long drawn out.<br />Overall, an okay series, but nothing to rave about. If you're a big fan of the WWII from the Pacific side or the Marines, you might like it'; we didn't find it too great.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It's like a live version of the game Risk. but in GoT there's action, betrayal, loyalty, death. it has everything.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman do an excellent acting job in this tale of life in France's prison system and, of course on the infamous Devil's Island. The book and film are fairly similar, so it you liked one, you should enjoy the other. Overall, this is an interesting film and well worthy of a viewing at least once, though, I've seen it more than once and will continue to do so in the future.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Absolutely amazing!!! Cumberbatch and Freeman are a delightful pair! Can't wait for the next season! I am Sherlocked for sure!
B00006CXSS|3.0|I know. I know. Everyone loves this series, except for us. Yes, it was well done. It is a decent mini-series, but overall, it was long and drawn out. Of course, that is our opinion. There was no reason that this couldn't be cut down to a shorter film, except that the producers were trying to dig a bit too deeply. Overall, we saw it once and for us that was enough.<br /><br />  If you're a big fan of WWII films, you should love this, but if you're not, you won't. We didn't.
B002PEP4EG|5.0|The best thing about this book is that it applies to all fields of endeavour.  Read and share it with family, friends and most of all work colleagues.  Enjoy!
1476727651|3.0|This is not a bad read, but there are so many annoying little things that just drove me crazy, and it just kept me from really enjoying this book.  King's liberal leanings come out in full force when he describes the weapons used by his characters.  \\"full auto\\"  handguns is the first tip off that he has no idea what he is talking about (they are semi-auto).  He then compounds this by having all his characters carry around a tiny little .22 and then proceed to inflict serious damage with these on the bad guys is almost laughable.  Sure you can kill someone with a .22, but the carnage he describes is a bit of a reach for a little .22 pop gun.  He also calls the weapon one of his characters is brandishing as a one nine one one.  Anyone carrying a 1911 would never call it that, and these are usually .45 cal or a 9 mm.  This is just one of the little details that I found extremely annoying about this book.  It is as if King decided to play buzz word bingo and reference things about which he did not bother to do any real research other than to convince himself that it sounded plausible in his own head.  King must be getting lazy in his old age, or he thinks his audience is just a bunch of stupid mindless fools that will read anything he writes and (we) don't have any peripheral knowledge about handguns, RVs, history, trains, etc.  There were several other little annoying but nagging things that were just off the mark - so much so that by the end of the book I was pissed off at him for ruining what could have been a really good story by being so sloppy and lazy.  I just kept putting the book down and yelling at it (him) when I stumbled across yet another sloppy detail, then picking it up again later after getting over the most recent in the list of constant little nagging things that kept popping up.<br /><br />The best part about this book was that King has finally abandoned the perverse side of his personality for a decent horror story reminiscent of the old days.
B00FVS4EUI|1.0|Paid for it and now it won't play - wtf amazon?! how do I get my money back??? No answers to be found anywhere!!! No more buying from this company thats for sure!
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I ordered the Arrow Box set which claims to include the first season on Blu Ray, DVD, and Ultraviolet.  It was a gift for distant friends.  When it arrived they informed me it had to go back because they didn't have Blu Ray... and the side of the box said BLU RAY only.<br /><br />I almost initiated the return and swap at my expense... only to suspect the DVDs were included anyway.  You see, season one comes two ways.  DVD only with 5 discs and this package I ordered with 9.  The other 4 had to be the BluRays.<br /><br />The problem is that Amazon's description indicates Blu Ray only.  It isn't IF down below it says 9 discs.<br /><br />I give 5 stars to this season & five stars to Amazon letting them open the package and checking to see if my theory was right.  Amazon deserves customer service points for adapting rules where warranted instead of following them to the letter.  It helped this time.
B0057O6IDW|1.0|Acting was really horrible. It was so bad I threw it in the trash. I have seen a better performance by the Italians on the Russian Front. in World War Two.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series, awesome plot twists, would highly recommend this series!  Historical details are intriguing, acting is superb and always leaves you wanting more.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great writing. Great story. I have thoroughly enjoyed them!  She makes the story feel real. I can see the characters and feel their joys and pains.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a charming book.  I read it to my class and many wanted to read it again on their own. Having it on Kindle is great
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of storytelling in &#34;Wool.&#34; I've gotten hooked on post-apocalyptic fiction lately and stumbled on this after reading Justin Cronin's &#34;The Passage.&#34; I really enjoyed the intricacies of the world of the silos. At the core of the book lies the question about what we will live by and for: fear or hope?
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|Atwood shows that she is still the queen of English-language dystopian novels. Her smart wit and fierce intelligence bring her characters to life--and to interesting deaths. We should all dance around the fire and sing her praises.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|If you like zombie movies, this one actually has a story line and very action packed.  And it has Brad Pitt in it.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I found this book for $0.99 and decided to buy it after I read a blog post about the book being recently available as an ebook.  What a find!  This book was entertaining from beginning to end.  I loved the characters, the city of Camorr and the vivid depictions the city sections.  I honestly didn't know how this story was going to unfold.  Just when I thought I could predict something, I was completely surprised.  It was this surprises that kept me reading and reading until I was done.  Sadly, I have finished...<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - a most excellent read!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing bingo and have played many different bingo apps as well as bingo games on my PC.  Bingo Blitz is so much fun!  It's more than just bingo, you have to complete collections in each room which makes it that much more fun.  I also enjoy the slots part of the game too!  The fact that it's free is awesome too!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I've purchased two of these now, so we can charge both an iphone and an android in each car.  Pretty small as advertised compared to most car chargers.  I like that you can use any cable you want and get a new cable if it wears out without having to get an all new car charger.  Seems to work as expected, however I haven't compared charging speed compared to a comparable amperage ac charger or an OEM car charger; but it gets the job done without any noticeable downsides.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I may be one of the only people on the face of the earth that didn't give this book a 5-star rating. Now now before you jump out of your seats and yell at me that \\"i'm crazy\\", let me explain myself. I absolutly LOVED the concept of this book, any book that is about books and the holocaust will always interest me. The holocaust is one part of history that has always intrigued me; the fact that human beings can be so brain-washed and evil astounds me.<br /><br />Zusak' writing was breath-taking and poetic, but at the same time very wordy, which some people MAY LOVE, but for me sometimes the lyrical, profetic writing style dosen't hold my attention because it's too wordy. I did enjoy the story, but this book took me close to three weeks to get through, not because it was bad, but because it was so overly descriptive that I could only read small chunks at a time, making a 500+ page book a bit daunting.<br /><br />I actually think that this may be a case of me liking the movie better then the book at least that is my prediction, because instead of being overly wordy the movie will be a visual masterpiece. I hope you guys reading this review take it with a grain of salt, i'm in no way saying I didn't enjoy this book, I think Markus Zusak is a genius, but just was too wordy for me!
1401311091|5.0|I bought a three book series and had never read this author before and really liked his books.  Keep your attention all the way through to the end.  Will be buying more as they come up for sale.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Great as a stand alone Zombie film.  Terrible as a book adaptation.  Watch it, its a good film.  Do yourself a favor and read the book too.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I had high hopes for this book as heard good reviews about the author.  I found the writing to not be worthy of the story line -- which was interesting and could have been so much more.  I tired quickly of the flippancy and superficiality of one of the main characters.  But I persevered through as was curious about how the story was going to end.<br /><br />I know this author is popular and well thought of so I may try another of her books.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Julian Fellowes is a wonderful creator/writer -- and his latest creation, Downton Abbey, doesn't disappoint!  It's a very fun rollercoaster ride that parallels world events of the time.  All 3 seasons (with 4 coming soon!) are worth watching ... several times!
B001P06GX4|5.0|Just got this from a box store today. Broke it open...in the beginning I thought wow this is going to be all too easy for the grownups but all but 6 or 7 moves left it started getting pretty tricky. I deffintly reccomend for a good brain teaser on family fun game night.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|A well-acted version of this Austen novel, with Fanny Price played quite well by Frances O'Connor, plus a few other really good British actors.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Lots of fun! But forget the in app purchases and get the telepods. You will have all the characters for a one time investment.
081297381X|4.0|This, as well as Mr. Taleb's other books, gave me a needed kick start in thinking critically about how I view the world. It inspired me to pick up the actual writings of philosophers instead of just reading what someone else has to say about them (although that, too, is worthwhile). It gave me a greater appreciation of why all those books are on the list of \\"Great Books.\\" It also made me realize what a unique opportunity I have in being able to pass these ideas and ways of thinking about and analyzing the world onto my children from an early age.  Plus it provided an enjoyable opportunity to practice all of that self-taught Latin.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Taleb.
B0073COMUW|4.0|I bought this bulb for my wife's sewing area. Versus an incandescent bulb, this LED bulb is superior in emitted light and hopefully MTBF (mean time before failure). My wife says that colors are more vibrant as well as lighting her work area much better. The reason for 4 out of 5 is that I sell industrial LED task lighting. I have a product spec-ed at the same lumen output but this bulb doesn't appear to emit the same amount of light. Overall though, it still is much better than an incandescent bulb.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I enjoy this series and I watch it all the time.  Great comedy and I like all the actors in the series.
0812993845|1.0|I had read all the poor reviews of this book, but love her books so decided to give it a try. For the 1st 100 pages I felt it wasn't too bad, and then I saw what everyone was talking about. So monotonous and ridiculous-I could not finish it.
B0091THRCU|4.0|This is a good case for the iPhone 5 very good quality like their ipad cases. I just wish the pocket for the cards would hold a few more cards.
B003JTHS5E|4.0|I'm enjoying this book very much. It has been recommended to us by more than one person. Great and worth the read!
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|I am a big fan of original hangover and like many others I was a bit disappointed by part 2 of the series. Didn't go to theater because of the same reason.<br /><br />But after watching part 3 I was pleasantly surprised that they didn't follow the same routine they copied from part 1 into part 2. Instead it had some original moments, slow at times but justifiable.<br /><br />Some of the parts are really funny, some aren't. But an OK ending to what started to be a great guy comedy.
B0035S996U|5.0|The gangs! Those gangs are Hollywood awesome! The Furies, the Boppers, the Lizzies, and all the rest had their own unique look. But most of all I love this film mostly for the iconic climax. Once you see it, you will always want to be driven in a hearse, sit in the passenger seat, and slowly drive around in an empty amusement park with bottles slid over your fingers in one hand, clinking rhythmically, calling out &#34;Warrrioorrrrs, cooOOOme out to PLAYeeyayy!&#34;.
B00AAQVSDW|4.0|Wow, I purchased this album after hearing a few of their hits on the radio and I'm really impressed with how good the rest of the album is.  There are 3 songs that are currently playing on the radio that are great and 3 or 4 other songs on the album that are very good. It seems like FGL came out of nowhere to take the country music world by storm but I know they have been working on their craft and this album for a while and it paid off.  Here's to many more hits from these guys and here's to much more success!
B001C08RHA|4.0|It was great. I still have to go back and look at it again to get a full understanding. I love Robert Downey Jr.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fun I play it a lot but the keys are unfair peapole spend 10000s of rollers on them I see why you put them in
1571200851|4.0|These fabric flowers are so amazing.  I tried to do them, but I just couldn't seem to get mine to look as good as hers.  It's a beautiful book
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have never read anything by this author before but I will look for more books authored by her. Although lengthy there was no chance I wasn't going to finish it. In the beginning I wondered how the three separate lives would be connected but you get there! The ending was unique and really made you think.
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|This was a good movie, although I am not good at picking out who didn't it this totally had me off guard. I was not expecting what happened to happen, the ending was very well done. ALL I can say is if you think you know you really don't know. Great movie!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|very good movie, left you wanting the next one so bad which is always a good thing for movies to do..
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What can I say, it has Nathan Fillion and it is the movie to one of the greatest TV series, ever! A must watch for anyone that loves syfy. Make sure to watch the Firefly series first.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|The app is fine. I only have 1 favorite part in it, and its not even good.<br />Not the worst but definitely not the best.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the greatest syfy series ever. To bad it was cancelled. One of the series that I have watched more than a few times. It is a must have for anyone that loves syfy.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Great album another head banger by drake. Start to finish every track is good! I suggest it to anyone who loves good music
B00FEN000S|5.0|This movie was fast moving, great graphics and clean enough for the entire family to watch a true Gem these days.
B001FB55M6|4.0|An interesting thought is we said yes to everything or everyone said yes to us. The results would be astonishing! What ever happens, it is what was exactly meant to happen.
B00FFVML74|2.0|This is certainly dark, but it appeared promising.  Then you get to the end, and discover that all the foreshadowing and innuendo in the previous episodes was ... for naught.  There was nothing in the previous episodes to make one suspect the culprit; there really was no character development of this culprit at all.  The ending thus appeared to be random, and, I think quite silly.  And it also gratuitously made the female detective appear to be something of an idiot to boot.<br /><br />Unmotivated, largely senseless ending and gratuitous sexism.  Really, really disappointing.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|The thing about Tarrantino is that his movies all have a great story, he just like to add in gore. I just close my eyes and it works out fine.
B005LAII1C|1.0|It's a movie about a living teddy bear who swears, drinks beer, and smokes pot. As always, Seth McFarlane hits the same notes his characters always hit - \\"I farted. I swore. I told a dirty joke. I made a racially-insensitive comment but it's okay because I'm a teddy bear.\\" So edgy. So boundary-pushing. So innovative. This movie is like a 107 minute long episode of Family Guy with a bunch of f-bombs thrown in. And don't get me wrong, I love \\"The Big Lebowski\\", so it's not the obscenity that bothers me; it's the pointless tedium of trying so hard to be \\"edgy\\". It's completely contrived and, ultimately, very boring.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This is an oldie but goodie! I bought this so my son and I could watch it together. The picture was very clear and the movie was in great shape.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|What a tremendous film! The packaging states \\"The next Avatar\\", but \\"Life of Pi\\" is actually far superior. First of all, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. It's difficult to put into words just what a stunning picture this is. Director Ang Lee has far out-done himself.<br /><br />But what is a beautiful picture without a compelling story? And the story of Pi (and of Richard Parker) is indeed compelling. This movie is so gripping that you feel like you are part of the story. Starting off with Pi's childhood (and Richard Parker's early years as well) and moving into Pi's teenage years, this film tells a story for the ages. Solid acting combines with the majesty of nature to wrap you up in a narrative that is highly spiritual and suitable for family members of all ages. You leave this film feeling like a better person for having seen it.

B00AESN8XY|3.0|This is a fun (albeit morbid) strategy game in which you try to wipe out the world with a plague. There are a number of different plague types, you start off with a fairly basic one and as you succeed in wiping out humanity, you unlock more advanced types of plagues. The graphics are absolutely polished and professional. The audio effects are okay, I usually played with the sounds and the music turned off.<br /><br />I enjoyed playing this game for awhile, but one day I noticed that something had changed. On application start-up, the program briefly flashes \\"Signing into Google\\". Why? I have no idea, and could not find any indication of this change from the developers. I like to know what applications are doing and how they are interacting with other services, and this unexpected change bothered me.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|While the book is pretty basic and a quick read, the concept is excellent and I recommend everyone consider this for their own well-being.

B007HO392S|4.0|We really like Carrie Underwood and thought her latest album was terrific.  We should have bought the album before attending the concert
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the most wonderful cryptic game I have played so far. Really enjoyed but was too short. More levels could have been their. Hope this is rectified in the next one.

B0033VUH6A|4.0|Great movie, intense in some parts. Really well done, however it got boring at times and I found myself playing on my iPad.  Wouldn't stop me from recommending it to others though.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Has a good plan and it places it develops some strong interest, then it's like it skips to something else without finishing that train of thought.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Much better than I anticipated. Fun, entertaining, and worth the watch.  Enjoyed all the actors that stared in te movie.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I have always finished what I start, so I kept reading hoping it would get better. It was very disappointing
B005UG53NS|4.0|A good finish to the series.  Daniel Radcliff has been proving that he can play other parts, now it will be interesting to see if the other actors can follow suit.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Written more like a compilation of vignettes, this story of the zombie apocalypse follows its initial outbreak to the (almost) breakdown of civilization to a story of hope.  Along the way you get a few scares, some tears, and the occasional laugh (or at least a smirk) to break the tension.  Ultimately, this is an enjoyable read, though if you're looking for the Brad Pitt character, just go rent the video. :)
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Excellent story flashing back and forth between main characters, slowly building tension and then climaxing toward the end of the book with an unexpected turn. Author did an excellent job setting up the resolution to the underlying theme, weaving many details of what may have been going on in both Churchill's and Hitler's camps. Excellent! Dialogue was very believable as well as story line. Will be reading more of his books!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|This was thought up from the beginning to be a 3D entertainment and it tells. It was intended to be visually stunning and it is. The cast accomplishes the difficult task of being the younger versions of the characters we know so well.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I bought this book while taking a(nother) break from learning German. I thought, &#34;maybe I can use memory techniques to learn German more efficiently.&#34;<br /><br />While I have not taken to memorizing decks of cards or thousands of digits of Pi, I have used some of the basic techniques to memorize the plethora of account numbers, passwords, etc., that I have put off for so long. (side note: it is actually a great idea to use words from PAO memory to create new passwords, as opposed to using random characters, etc. More memorable, and better encrypted.)<br /><br />I have come to use my naturally powerful spatial memory to great advantage. I remember names quite easily, now. Even against my autistic tendency to forget faces almost immediately, I have used techniques to help me think of a person's face as a map, allowing for far greater recall. Rarely, anymore, do I feel embarrassed during a secondary greeting with a person I've met only once in passing.<br /><br />I loved this book in its entirety. The journalistic point was fascinating. The techniques introduced were immensely useful. The scientific insight was enthralling. And Foer WINNING the Championship was inspiring.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Very informative and well done. Excellent 3D work with great surround sound track. During the shuttle launches, you think you are right there.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE SwiftKey!<br /><br />I use diacritics commonly. SwiftKey has an option (Theme & Layout &#62; Accented Characters) that allows me to use umlauts for German and diacritics for other non-English borrowings. Ideally, I would be able to use a circumflex over C, G, H, J, and S, as well as a breve over U when writing in Esperanto, but this can be worked around using the X-convention and familiarity with words using the /au/ obstruent.<br /><br />A big help in learning the non-standard Dvorak layout was the ability to use this layout within SwiftKey. This option is only available with physical keyboards using iOS 7, and is not an option on the stock Android keyboard.<br /><br />The predictive text is pretty wonderful, as well. It saves me a TON of time using one tap, especially when typing in German, a language known for its insanely long compound nouns.<br /><br />This app is WELL worth the purchase. I have saved that money dozens of times over in prevented frustration, to say the least!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|A fun story line through all three books, very adult and a bit kinky but just fun to read. This is a real love story if you are able to put yourself in Cristian's and Anastasia's head as the story unfolds. Lots to learn here about what unconditional love really means. There is no abuse in these books because abuse is best understood as being subjected to something you do not want. Want is what this love story is about. Have fun.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|My husband and I both read this book and we both had different thoughts about the end result. I thought it was beautfiul and I sobbed in the end and through most of this book; my husband thought he was selfish in the end....it is a beautiful moving story...I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good read.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|Being new to AHS, I watched all of season 1 and 2 on DVD in anticipation of the new season that just started last week.  I'm hooked!  I love horror - more along the lines of supernatural, paranormal, and the disturbing. Season 2, Asylum, blends all three of those genres and begins with quite a bit of gore as well.<br /><br />What makes this such a great show is that each season is a completely different storyline so you don't have to watch them in order. You also get to see some of the same great actors and actresses from season 1, but they do play completely different characters. Jessica Lange was amazing in season 1, and she's even better in season 2 as the head nun of Briarcliff Manor - a Catholic run hospital for mental patients and the criminally insane.<br /><br />What is also unique about AHS is that there are so many characters to focus on. The writers do a great job of teasing you along in each episode with scenes that give you back story and keep you watching and wanting answers. Just keep watching and know that your questions may not be answered until the very end!<br /><br />There is also lots of tidbits of stories that borrow from real life headlines - the most obvious being Geraldo Rivera's 1970s story on Willowbrook State School. Laura Winters' breaking story that brings her lots of fame directly mirrors Rivera's real life story and documentary.<br /><br />The season starts like a thrill ride and will definitely scare you and make you squirm. It eventually settles down and begins building those connections with the characters as each storyline plays out. You'll be surprised who you hate by the end and who you have sympathy for. Just like in season 1, there are lots of cliff hangers and things aren't always as they seem.  The show keeps you guessing!  And being completely different from season 1 is what makes it even better!<br /><br />If you want a good solid cast and a good solid psychological and disturbing story line that will frighten you, AHS Season 2 is it!son 2 is it!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Its been an excellent show through Season 2. I enjoyed watching the real challenges of forgiveness and commitment required to sustain a marriage through infidelity. But then the writers had to go and ruin it. Only in Hollywood does a 1-night affair years ago cause a spouse to 'cheat' after she managed to hold together her marriage and family through a public scandal with a prostitute.
B00EV4EUT8|3.0|Lee Daniels' The Butler is something of a mixed bag. Had it been made twenty years ago, it might have stood on more original ground, but in 2013 it has a highly derivative feel to it, like what you'd get if you crossed Backstairs at the White House (a TV-miniseries from the 1980's that related the real-life experiences of a mother and daughter who worked as maids at the White House over a period of fifty years, starting with the Taft administration and ending with the arrival of JFK) and Forrest Gump where the life of a fictional character seems to cross paths with all the notable figures of his day.<br /><br />It is important to emphasize that in spite of the impression the promotions for The Butler give, this film is in fact fiction. It is supposedly based on the life of a real-life White House butler named Eugene Allen, but other than the fact that Forrest Whitaker's character - a butler named Cecil Gaines - works at the White House for over three decades - almost nothing that happens in the film had anything to do with Allen's actual life.<br /><br />Besides Whitaker's stand-out performance, the supporting cast are quite good as well, from Oprah Winfrey as Gaines' much put-upon boozed-up wife to Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Lenny Kravitz as Cecil's fellow staffers and Terrence Howard as a somewhat too familiar neighbor. David Oyelowo does a creditable job as Cecil's elder son, Louis, who takes the audience through almost every aspect of the black civil rights' experience, from joining the Freedom Riders and participating in sit-in protests at segregated diners to the later Black Panther movement and later still into the rising of black candidates for political office. The script, however, does not leave him a lot of room to be more than a symbolic character for the ear, but Oyelowo does manage to breathe some genuine individuality into the character which helps us to identify with the events he experiences.<br /><br />A major drawback to the film however is the truly bizarre casting of most of the various Presidents of the era. Robin Williams' Eisenhower comes across more as a benign Elmer Fudd than the man who once commanded Allied forces during WWII. James Marsden does a creditable JFK, particularly in a scene where we see him laid out on the floor by the chronic back pain he had to endure through most of his adult life. But Liev Schreiber's LBJ, though he does have a great comic scene as he gives orders to his staff while sitting on the toilet, is badly miscast, employing arguably the worst attempt at a Texas accent ever recorded on film. John Cusack's Nixon is - one presumes - unintentionally hilarious as he slouches about with a fake nose. The film skips over Ford entirely, leading directly into Alan Rickman's Reagan, where you have to wonder \\"What _were_ they thinking?\\" as Rickman's sole attempt at conveying Reagan was having his hair slicked up. Reagan was British?  Who knew?<br /><br />Recommended for Forrest Whitaker's outstanding performance and for the scenes that deal with the early civil rights struggle, but otherwise should be regarded as a watchable fictionalization of an important period of history rather than the story of a real individual's life.izarre casting of most of the various Presidents of the era.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|It has the basics of Cinderella; prince, step mother, step sisters, but this isn't your typical Cinderella story! Totally new spin on it. I would highly recommend this book!!!!!!!!
B008JFUNKU|5.0|Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is the story of a 2009 incident that most people probably still remember, when a group of Somali pirates boarded an American cargo freighter, the Maersk Alabama, and after failing to gain control of the ship, took its captain, Richard Phillips, hostage, resulting in the US Navy mounting an intense rescue operation to recover Captain Phillips. Directed by Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum) from a script by Billy Ray (Breach, The Hunger Games) based on a book written by Phillips and Stephan Talty about the incident, Captain Phillips is a well-crafted, tense docu-drama that captures the intensity of the events as they played out, from the moment the Maersk Alabama first sees the approaching pirate crafts to the moment when Navy Seals make their assault, ending the situation with deadly finality and the successful rescue.<br /><br />More than anything else, the core of Captain Phillips is the contest of wills that takes place between Phillips (a finely nuanced performance by veteran Tom Hanks) and the pirate leader Muse (an amazingly intense performance by first-time actor Barkhad Abdi). Phillips is determined to do everything he can to keep the pirates from gaining control of the ship and to keep his crew from being captured and held hostage, while Muse is determined to succeed in achieving the pirates' version of the American dream, against all odds and no matter what risks he and his men must take. Hanks' Phillips is a man who desperately hangs on to his sense of calm in the face of mounting danger because he knows it's his - and his crew's - only path to safety. And survival. Abdi's Muse is more complex. On the one hand, he displays a relentless cunning and daring, combined with the ability to take the lead, that invites your unwilling admiration even as he engages in threats and brutality to gain and keep control of the situation. But at the same time, he shows an incredible naivety about just what he is doing, not thinking beyond securing his catch of the day. At one point he tells an astonished Phillips of his plan to go to America with the money he'll get from the ransom and buy a car. There is also a certain hubris about Muse that makes his character at least pitiable if not actually sympathetic as things begin to go wrong and he feels his control - and his chances for his big score - rapidly slipping away from him. This is most particularly brought home in the form of an increasingly unstable pirate named Najee (Faysal Ahmed) whom Muse had hand-picked for the operation but who now is threatening to kill their hostage.<br /><br />The musical score by Henry Jackman (X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass) is very well done, adding to the sense of rising tension without distracting from what is happening on the screen. And in addition to the music, Greengrass makes excellent use of sound, particularly the sounds of a ship gone dead in the water, creating a sense of an alien space that the pirates have invaded when they go searching for the crew, each random creak and clang breaking the silence wearing at the pirates' khat-frayed nerves. (Note: khat is a plant native to the region whose leaves, when chewed, act as an amphetamine-like stimulant, and all of the pirates are seen chewing khat since the operation began).<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a taut thriller that will keep your attention  gripped to the screen for its entire 134 minutes.ng beyond securing his catch of the day.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|The reading public has had enough. Mr. Bryson has to be stopped from writing in such a warm, personal, humorous style.  How can we bear to have history related in such a page turning fashion?  We are tired of have each chapter end with a curious hook that prohibits us from putting down the book.<br /><br />Nor can we countenance the mixture of statistics and historical fact with simple artful storytelling that makes the individuals come to life.<br /><br />How is it possible to focus on one particular period, discuss numerous historical occurrences, and yet show their pivoting importance in the life of our country?<br /><br />The subjects covered by Mr. Bryson are too numerous to list.  The 27 Yankees, the politics of the era, the Lindbergh phenomena, the financial decisions at the root of the Great Depression, Al Capone, murder trials of the day, even a primer on electrocution all find their way onto the pages of this book.<br /><br />Especially troubling were the sections that related to the prejudice and hated prevalent in society.<br /><br />Mr. Bryson has set the bar too high. I pity other authors that attempt to relate history in such an entertaining and warm style while still presenting the depth required by complex issues.<br /><br />Excellence should not be encouraged, It makes the mediocre uneasy.  I implore you Mr. Bryson stop. It is making me uneasy.

B0052REUW0|5.0|One of the most interesting books I have ever read. Long, but so well written, full of so many surprising facts, that I cannot stop reading. Pinker has done an impressive amount of careful detailed research to document all his claims. Even if one disagrees, one has to begin by examining his data. There is a prevailing tendency, probably in our genes, to believe that things are getting worse and to dream of a golden age in the past. We tend to forget how bloody our past really has been. As far as violence is concerned, there has been truly amazing progress.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone seriously interested in psychology, anthropology, history, and politics.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|What an interesting piece of writing. \\"Charlie\\" writes throughout the book and pulls the reader in to the life of a young boy, as he is working his way through the difficult task of navigating high school. The social norms and themes of the day seem to baffle Charlie, yet he perseveres and goes on to find a \\"crowd\\" of his own.<br /><br />Through the book we follow, learn, grow and wait for \\"the next thing\\". A delightful look at life from someone else's view.<br /><br />Wonderful twists and turns of humanity to give hope for absolute friendships.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Need to see all these episodes together to piece together what was going on.  Series all over the place on TV and hard to keep up with.
B0094K1K8I|4.0|Not as scary as #1 and #2, but good for the time around Halloween. would recommend to anyone who likes to get scared.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is easier to follow the story line than try to keep up with it on TV.  TV moves it around too much.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I am very satisfied with this wonderful app. Its free.but I would have paid for it because it would be worth it. Instantly see the verse you are reading in several different bible translations including the King James (for people that think JW's have their own bible). If you like to do research,it has maps and facts about bible places and people. Simply amazing.
B005LAIGNC|1.0|Saw this movie on HBO.<br />True, black men flew planes in WWII, painted their plane tails red and were treated badly by the white government.<br /><br />It is a shame that the real history of those courageous Black men were treated by a movie, in such a flippant way.<br />But that is how Liberals see black people, as caricatures.<br /><br />I found myself wanting more historical accuracy. There are a lot of records of what those American Heroes did.<br /><br />There is no mention of Black Patriot Frank Mann who taught the Tuskegee Airmen how to fly and no mention at all of white Patriot Howard Hughes, the man who as a lifelong friend of Frank Mann, made sure the US government sent the Tuskegee Airmen their new planes.<br />The new planes were a really big deal.<br /><br />I expected to see tap dancing at any moment.<br />I cannot believe that the black actors read the script and still did the movie.<br /><br />Hopefully Lucas' Educational Foundation will be more historically accurate, when trying to reform and improve K-12 education. But I doubt it.<br /><br />Another Communist, who got all his money from Capitalism.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Easy to play game that is addictive to keep playing. Also holds my kids' attention in a fun non-violent way, unlike most games they play

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I'm 57 and started backpacking again for fun,fitness,fishing,etc.  Having not shouldered a backpack in decades, it was very humbling to participate in this activity again.  Cheryl Strayed captures the experience in her book better than anybody ever has.<br />Her story and metamophosis from her jouney on the PCT is something we are extremely lucky to read about.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I enjoyed this novel even more than the Kite Runner.  The main characters were rich in their perceptions and the trials and tribulations they experienced gave insight into beliefs of a culture not easy to understand.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|It got to my house fast and in great condition!! I now own the complete Greys anatomy series up to this point!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Good script, great acting, and fantastic location...makes dreary series like The Killing somewhat pale in comparison. I will definitely watch the rest.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game about the imagination of creepers spiders and zombies and skeletons with the bow and Steve with<br />Herobrine
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Holy crap did Richelle Mead step up her game with this book. Intrigue with the royal court as Victor Dashkov may be freed, Moroi deciding to use their magic to help guardians fight, Rose dealing with the death of Mason and FINALLY realizing the cost of her shadow kissed nature. With a devastating attack by the Strigoi on the academy the ending is a shocker and the series takes off in a very different direction. Outstanding story and I'm hooked now. Already picked up the next book, Blood Promise.
B00006I53S|4.0|Bought a used lens. So far I have been very pleased. My only other lens was the kit lens that came with the camera, so I'm not a pro or serious amateur, but I have been taking SLR photos for years and owned my DSLR for three years. I wanted a lens I could use on vacation and zoom in closer than I am used to with an 18-55mm lens. The ultrasonic motor is new to me, and worked well, with a little less noise than the old lens, but still audible. I had to buy new filters of course, as the new lens was bigger in diameter, but I found them easier. I added a UL filter immediately, and got a circular polarizer for landscape/outside shots. One of the other posts complained about \\"zoom creep\\" and said their lens would \\"slam down\\" to full zoom when the camera was tilted down or put in a camera bag. Mine did not suffer from this severe zoom creep. I put it on a tripod and pointed it at the ground. When fully retracted, it did not zoom out on its own, at all. When zoomed about halfway out, and left alone, eventually it would creep out a little, but there was no slamming out or anything so immediate.<br />Problems: Lens size. My old lens and camera fit very nicely in my little lowepro bag. the new lens is too long, even retracted, so I use my larger compuday pro backpack, which works well, but not for just walking around. Good for vacations when you want to carry around extras anyway like a raincoat or snacks or something, but not for just walking around. The other problem is weight. This new lens is at least twice the weight of my old one. Its a big deal hanging around your neck for eight hours at disney world. I was glad for some of the rides where I could take it off and put it away. The size is impressive too. It makes a smaller rebel look like a larger pro camera instead of a momtographer's toy, so it might tempt someone to take yours instead of the others, since everyone seems to have one, now.<br />Overall I like the lens. It is big and solid, fits well on the camera, and has the IS and AF switches in the same place as the kit lens, so no confusion there. I had not played with my camera in a while before going on vacation, so it was a bad choice on my part to get a new lens and not practice a lot. I noticed my shots have suffered some, but since they were mostly things like shutter speed and iso selection, not connected to how the lens works, I can't very well blame the lens. Same fstop range as the kit lens, so I didn't lose any light there... pleased so far.as the IS and AF switches in the same place as the kit lens, so no confusion there.

B00DW39B2K|2.0|A Serbian terrorist comes to the USA to kill the American who executed him? Their conflict then turns into anti war propaganda? DeNiro must have needed money to make this film. It is truly bad.
B00FEN1C50|2.0|this movie was bad, special effects where great, but the acting was downright terrible. 13 year old kid would like it, anyone older stay away, its like &#34;the mighty morphin power rangers&#34; with a higher budget.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Move up from room to room by finding tools &amp; breaking ciphers.  This game is not as intimidating as many of the same genre. It's a pleasant and amusing pastime.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Many choices for that a.m. buzzer.  Wake up to church bells from the countryside in the middle of the city.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The ending was a bit corny, but all in all this was a well thought out movie, one that was very different from most others in the genre.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Let our 5 and 8 year old watch this.  5 year old was definitely too young, but the 8-year old was totally entranced.  Hopefully he ignored the language, and only slept in our bed one night (due to all the skeletons).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is  a great fun game I play when I have a few minutes to spare. A ton of fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an amazing game ,awesome graphics and Much more like the jet packs and the constantly updating coolness.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is entertaining with a twist.  It was hard to put it down.  A good read that keeps you wanting more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a wonderful, yet painful story of young love and early death.  My 15 year old grandson recommended this book to me and I'm very grateful.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy this game - maybe too much! The creators have given each dragon a background and unique qualities. You get the opportunity to breed them and see if you can get a rare or super rare dragon. You can change their names, feed them, watch them grow. Works well on my Kindle Fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you liked this game download templerun one and two there really awesome I recommend it for boys and girls if you like adventures
B001P06GX4|5.0|If you are looking for a game for 7 - 15+ year olds, I recommend this one.  It's strategy based, such as many of the other more 'technical' games, but allows for people to interact and talk with each other while they are playing an &#34;old fashioned&#34; type game.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a fun show to watch and will certainly provide you with some laughs. As it twists and turns it certainly keeps you interested.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The reviews indicate this video has levels. The levels are there and as a consumer of the product, I'm able to work at my own pace. Delivery was timely. And the product was exactly as I expected.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was very hard to put down. I found myself reading at 3 am several times. I can't wait to read the next book.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|great game! uses more logic than the other escape type puzzle games.  can not stop playing it is so addictive
B001HN6922|2.0|Unfortunately, we did not open the DVD and watch it until a few months after we received it.  It stopped playing half way through the movie.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Was looking for a small secure storage device for my micro SD cards - this is perfect!  It holds 4 micro cards plus 2 standard cards; one of which is my SD/micro adapter card with one more micro card inserted. This all fits neatly in my POV GoPro case. Wish they made these cards for 4 SD cards and for compact flash (CF) cards as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great interface, l love the options, easy to use, good mindless entertainment, definitely recommend it for Kindle or cell phone.
B003Y5H59C|3.0|My wife and I generally enjoyed this movie, however felt that the pacing throughout most of it was very slow.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a fun hidden object game.  Some scenes seems harder to see than others. It's nothing but hidden objects.  You have so many points to use. It takes about an hour for some of your points to restore. Has some purchasing if you want to buy,however it can be played and you can advance without purchase
B008OOYALE|4.0|I enjoy the game, one issue I have it is difficult to add neighbors. Besides that I've really enjoyed playing the game.

B002H3EUAE|5.0|I love this movie even though I have seen it many times it always makes for many laughs. It shows family life in a great light.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Also one of the greatest moments in human history. I highly recommend this film. Great directing as well as great acting.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I view this classic every holiday season and never tire of it. They do not make movies like this anymore. A must for all old time movie buffs.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is so much fun!! One thing I would like to see is it automatically update on my Kindle Fire.  Otherwise everything is just great!!(:
B001ECQ6PG|3.0|I'm giving this turntable 3 start because it has some interesting features, like ability to play on batteries and a variety of out ports(there's stereo RCA, 1/8-jack and 1/4 jack!) and it's cheap, otherwise it would've been 1 star. The main problem is that the rotation speed of the plate is not consistent. It sometimes fluctuates back and forth which makes the sound go out of tune and it sounds pretty bad. I tried listening to Dark Side of the Moon on it and I had to stop after several songs.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I understand that language is important to establish the tone of a book,  but I felt bad language was excessive.  Otherwise, God bless the Seals and their counterparts.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|Great classic!! This is a fun movie to see with great music and to see the actors as young formers and now established performers.
B002OQT928|5.0|I enjoyed watching this with my 5 yr old and we were both cracking up through the whole thing.  Seems like Diego is getting old!!!! LOL
B008CPZNL6|1.0|never would let me open it! would just like to forget it not worth trying again. I think to many people trying to connect.
B003GXJ072|4.0|I haven't watched this movie since I was 5 years old.  Yes my mother allowed me to watch horror flicks at that age and to this day I still enjoy them.  It's amazing how long ago this movie was made since they just made a 4th part of this series not too long ago.  But it was nice reminiscing how it all started
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I was messing around on my friends phone when I was drawn into the adorable world of Dumb ways To Die by the cute little character on the front. The app is full of fun challanges to keep you occupied between commercials AND long car rides. This app will become the new Temple Run!!!! Get NOW! :D
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Works great and good price.  I do think extra care will be needed to prevent scratching.  Makes a big difference.
B0016BP0PW|4.0|This is basically one long music video which makes sense since the director started out making making videos. The sound and video quality is excellent. Be warned that this is not a perfect movie. It is too long and at times weak on plot. With this movie I find that I have my favorite scenes that I never get tired of watching. Dear Prudence is by far my favorite song in the movie. If you like the Beatles you may very well like this movie.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I was never really a huge iron man fan but the last two movies really changed my mind. Third one is my favorite
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Love this show.  Can't wait to finish next season and then the next and the next  think you get the idea!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy it because it tests your knowledge and helps you understand exactly how to go by doing it.it is also fun
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|takes up a lot of memory i deleted tons of games but i dont want to delete every thing but i seen someone play it on ipad and it was sweet
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I was afraid I wouldn't like reading a book on my cell phone. To my surprise, the font is easy to read, the background is bright and makes reading easy. I'm using the phone to read my books more than I'd anticipated.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book. It was great on audio!! It really made you think about things. I laughed and cried. The author really drew you into the characters lives.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I adore the Jack Reacher character, and have read most of the novels, but as I read this overly long tome, I began to wonder if Childs even wrote this book. In certain ways, it's so different than his other stories.<br /><br />In general, Jack Reacher has characteristics that make him unique and special among suspense-novel protagonists. He has a great sense of integrity and is truly a hero, rescuing and defending everyday people he encounters with no thought of personal gain. He's a big guy with superior fighting skills and a good sense of timing. But best of all is Reacher's quick, witty banter. His sense of humor lightens the tension and makes him appear as if he doesn't take himself too seriously.<br /><br />This wit is noticeably absent in \\"The Affair.\\" The story is drawn out and gets bogged down with superfluous details. The fight scenes are written in a stilted style, with entire paragraphs using \\"I\\" as the first word in every sentence. Worst of all are the implausible murders Reacher commits. Yes, it's fiction and not entirely realistic. But here Reacher seems out of character, more like a rogue cop whose integrity is barely above that of his targets. And his cohorts and superiors are too quick to aid him and cover up the murders, no questions asked, as if the government will simply accept the story. Sure, the villains deserved it, but he's a military cop, not a hit man! A cop would have arrested at least some of them.<br /><br />Oh, and usually Childs doesn't write a detailed description of Reacher's occasional sexual encounters. Again, it's not in character.
B00932A4XE|5.0|I watch this movie over and over again and never fail to laugh. It tickles my funny bone. There are something like 4 story lines going at once so I am never bored and the acting is top notch. The scenes with the dad's in the dudes club are hiliarious.
1400069289|5.0|This book is very well written and clearly explains why we do what we do and how to change what we do.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Addicting. My Fire HD screen not large enough for complete game board to be displayed. Still addicted. First free game I will purchase.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I am a Dan Brown fan but I had a hard time finishing this book.  It was interesting in the beginning but the end faltered and didn't keep my attention.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are nicely framed, given great dialogue, and allow for an overview of what's wrong with the life &#34;royals&#34; must live to &#34;carry on&#34; with British traditions. As Americans we are fascinated with this other-worldly lifestyle, and are basically glad we tipped the scales by our daring tea party in the Boston harbor.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|The laughs don't die off in this action film.  It isn't a deep film, but I crack up every time I watch it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Ok so maybe it's not the greatest movie of all time but it's definitely entertaining and Benedict Cumberbatch is in it being very Cumberbatchtastic.
B008AVXGA2|5.0|This is a really fun children's story! It is a modern version of a Russian fairy tale, where two children enter a different realm through a portal located in their aunt's house. There, they encounter the magical firebird whose feathers have the power to heal. But their adventure becomes dangerous when they run into a Russian witch named Baba Yaga.<br /><br />This journey ends up being quite a learning experience for the young children. The author does an excellent job describing this fantastical world. I really loved the imagery, and I also really loved the firebird!<br /><br />I have never had the pleasure of reading any Russian fairy tales before, so I'm glad to have had the opportunity.<br /><br />This is a book that I'm sure my nephews will enjoy when they're a little bit older. I also look forward to sharing it with children of my own that I may hopefully have someday!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids love playing this they really like all the minons but they wish they could get more than just the two easier ones to get.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am not a big reader and read this book for work, but can't put it down. It's a great story and definitely gets the reader and their emotions to come out.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is an amazing book on how nutrition effects the brain. I love how clearly Dr. Perlmutter explains how the brain is effected by what we eat.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This is a very good compilation of all of the Holmes stories. I have two devices that I use to read Kindle books: my pc, and my smart phone. I downloaded this for one of those and have plowed my way through it. It isn't the first time I've read the entire &#34;canon,&#34; nor will it be the last.
B006ZL1KAW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think Puddicombe does a great job of making meditation accessible for busy lives.  He has a wonderful way of making meditation concepts approachable and easy to grasp.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|The movie was awesome, but the book is confusing and I absolutely hate the lay out in which it is written.
B00ATUEKY8|3.0|I had read this many years ago, but my book club picked it to read. A very dark book in my opinion, but found the autobiography  of Sylvia  plaits very interesting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful!  Well done!  I hope there is more to come!  I liked it so much that I purchased the Blue-Ray pack for my library!
B0000085N4|5.0|If you want to worship at a sonic temple this is one to be a supplicant within.  Billy Duffy's guitars and treatments burn and sear and scorch.  They flow, breathe, and wail.  The stand-up strong front lines of classical steel string acoustic guitar that leads off the phenomenal \\"Edie (Ciao Baby)\\" and then ignites into a searing blaze, bolstered by the rise and swells of keys that lay down an ocean tide of suffused emotion, capped off by Ian Astbury's tender but strong sympathetic vocals make this a perfect song.  It hits all of the notes and is worth the price of admission twice over.<br /><br />And the crazy thing is that this outstanding track doesn't overshadow the rest of the album.  As any late '80s guitar fan knows this album dropped the bombastic \\"Fire Woman\\" on us (love the build and drive of that intro!) but there are so many straight up solid guitar forward hard rock tracks that lace this album (kick off track \\"Sun King\\", minor hit \\"Sweet Soul Sister\\", and the blues swag of \\"Automatic Blues\\" just to name a few).  The last half of the album isn't as strong as the first, sure, but there's a lot of sweet crunchy bluster to find (messy closing track \\"Medicine Train\\" has a great feel and some great Duffy lead guitar).<br /><br />\\"Soul Asylum\\", situated squarely in the middle of the album, is another showcase song but because of it's length (7 plus minutes), slower tempo, and spacious (but not catchy) chorus it was never bound to be a hit.  However this song encapsulates the greatness of this album: driving bass and propelling keys, solid drumming, mesmerizing guitars (oh, freaking fantastic!) and powerful vocals wrapped in a great production by Bob Rock make this an overlooked but absolute classic that was caught in the shadows of \\"Fire Woman\\" and \\"Edie (Ciao Baby)\\".<br /><br />The Cult rock my world.  Time to revisit the temple.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Season 2 is a fantastic followup to season one. It kept me interested the entire season and really made me acknowledge that Suits is my favorite tv show period. The writing, acting, everything, in my opinion, is nothing short of stellar.
B000ZM1MG4|4.0|Even better than I remembered.  Loved the extra materials.  Jessica Lange was and shall always be a beauty.  See it.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Well this is no Lord of the Rings but it was pretty good fun. Aside from the magic beans there is not much that is similar to the fairy-tale, which is good in that the film is reasonably original in how it develops the story. Jack is a farm boy (though you wouldn't know it from his hands!) who finds himself on a rescue mission to save the princess and then the world. The lead actor looks a bit too much like Ashton Kutcher but the giants are quite interesting and Ewan McGregor is allowed to have a lot of fun. I thought the special effects were good and the battle scenes entertaining. Much of the dialogue is a bit twee and there's predictable co-incidences but happily a few reasonable twists too. There's a gruesome moment or two as well, so it's not for small kids but most action genre fans will probably have a pleasant time over it. 3 1/2 stars
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|A minion version of Temple Run.  Takes forever to download.  When you think it's finally done, it downloads some more.
0783229526|5.0|This movie will make you wish you had a time machine so you can travel back to the 1970s and go to Vegas with Hunter S. Thompson and his attorney. Best. Movie. Ever.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I found it hard to put this book down. I was so drawn to the main characters and felt so many different emotions. Excellent writing.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I love this movie. It's fun and quirky and it just shows you how one person can affect and help another. A true testament to life and people.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Really great album. I love how he blended folk music with electronic. It really creates an interesting blend of styles.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|This group rocks on. They love what they do and they do it well. Great CD and in concert even better.
1451668945|3.0|really just OK for Mary Higgins Clark....I have read better. Having said that, I still ENJOY a fast read that will just DISTRACT me for a while.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it!  Watched both Season 2 and 3 within a couple of  weeks time. I would highly recommend to anyone.
0385536828|3.0|an interesting novel...but...very &#34;rambling&#34; and I just didn't get it.  Still...a quiet, distracting, mildly entertaining book.  Loaned to a friend who usually shares my taste in novels and she felt the same as me.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This story is set in England in the 1400's I think. The author explores in his series (the cousin's war) from the different angles of the characters involved.  This is another mystery of sorts as it details one of the characters involved in the story of England's kings.
B004I744AS|5.0|I was using different dictionary but a lot of vocabulary were missing. This app is more up to date and thorough. I recommend it to all or at least give it a try.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I enjoyed this book and the &#34;Cousins&#34; series. by Author Phillippa Gregory, and ordered another  book by this prolific author.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book in the series seems to move a little more whereas book 1 was a set-up and book 2 took forever to get started.  Like the title says, you don't need a review for this book, so hopefully your amazon-ing is going well!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Decided to reread Ender's Game before I see the movie and again I am blown away. I appreciate it in new ways every time I read it. As I change and get older it means different things to me. Every time I read it though it is powerful and moving, one of my most favorite books of all time!
1781162646|3.0|It isn't a typical Stephen King novel, that's for sure. Maybe somewhat more like one of the early 50's crime novels, say, &#34;Chinatown.&#34; It does keep you guessing to some degree about the murderer, but I never felt very vested in the young man who lives the story. The most touching character is the dying young, slightly psychic boy, but you kind of know how that's going to end. Also, while the kid seems to free the ghost in the haunted house, that whole denouement is more than a bit fuzzy, so I was quite disappointed in that particular storyline. She was there; she was murdered; she went free. Really? Why now? Why this kid? This story is worth reading once if just for the nostalgic look back at carnivals and local fairs. Frankly, the rest, especially with its' anti-preacher rant, is a bit over the top.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|One of the best Iron movies, after seeing previews I was glad to see it did not go as I had envisioned.
B00E95ED32|2.0|Like the sound of Avicii? Then this album is not for you. Expected from one of the most recognized EDM DJ's comes a collaboration of mainstream pop sensation. Honestly you can find nearly all these songs on the radio...or from some of your parents' albums/records. I will give Avicii credit for not collaborating with Lil' Jon, Nicki Minaj, Lil' Wayne or whoever else ruined the mainstream sound. You are able to hear a hint of house in there, but it has been drowned out with the country and oldies influence. Some of Avicii's work I have from 2011 and 2012 cannot even be compared with whatever his new style is.<br /><br />Songs are ok, but are not appealing to EDM fans. I personally like 'Wake Me Up' and 'Hey Brother'.<br /><br />Recommendation: Only purchase a song if you like it...
B006TZGVZS|5.0|Truly an awesome book!  What an easy read that you won't want to put down.  I'm looking forward to reading other books by this author.
B004CMBZJC|4.0|I enjoyed the series, I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun British series. It's not as good as Doctor Who, but what is?
B00FVS3RZQ|4.0|It is available for purchase now, but it keeps throwing up an error message. I woke up an hour early to watch it, and now I am scared I won't get to see it before work!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|If I can get further along I may up the star level. I like it and yet I don't. I feel like it repeats too much. Though the graphics are quite cool it just has not kept my attention as much as other games...so far.<br /><br />I am still new to it so maybe I have not unlocked a needed source to advance yet. Got side tracked when Minions was available on Kindle Fire which I was waiting for.<br /><br />I am a TempleRun2 addict (on level 9) and do very well at that one (still wondering if I will get to level 10 or if there is one). Into Minions and Jet Pack as well to give you an idea.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Every single character is unique and brilliant.  There is great suspense to this show, a feeling that you don't want it to end, and that is due to the people involved in the plot.  Setting is wonderful and foreign, but throughout the scenes, the characters interact, speak with their beautiful accents, and establish more mystery until you yearn for more.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This would get a 5 if it did not take so long to load between games on my Kindle Fire AND crash my Kindle to point of needing to charge it overnight to do anything at all with it because I love the graphics and it is totally fun.<br /><br />Hopefully these irritations will be fixed soon. Fun and funny.<br /><br />Compared to TempleRun 2 (my other favorite game)...at least here the scenery changes even if the competing level is not quite as hard. I have made headway much faster than I did in TempleRun2 beginnings.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Lots of action but the story line was lame.  The earlier Iron Mans were fun this one was just too over-the-top to really enjoy.  Glad I rented streaming video version in HD via Amazone vice purchasing the Blue Ray disk.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Such a great find.  I got it on the daily free app but I would gladly pay for this one.  Love that you can layer tracts and set a timer in case you fall asleep.  I also like that you can play it in the background while you read,  Awesome!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|The Croods is a cute and comical animation. With insights into a world unseen by modern eyes. The cave dwellers resembled our first interpretations of Neanderthals, but at they end of the movie more positive insight was shown. To the more current theories of how neanderthals were smarter then what was first believed.
0099549069|2.0|I understand I bought a USED book, but it stated in &#34;Like New&#34; condition.  Book arrived with huge slash through first 20 pages and cover.  Contacted company but they only offered me 15% off of a future purchase, which does me no good for the ruined book I received.
0307719774|5.0|Love this! Such a fun way to track memories. Product came on time and completely sealed as advertised. Love it!
6304493681|3.0|To be honest, I bought this thinking it was the anime series, but it is actually a stand alone film. In case that applies to you too, the series is called &#34;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&#34;. Apparently this is the first anime adaptation of the comic though, so it seems like a reasonable place to start if you are interested in Ghost in the Shell.<br /><br />As such, I found it pretty disappointing. Some of my friends had talked up Ghost in the Shell and I remembered seeing a few episodes on Adult Swim and liking them. But I found the plot of this film too convoluted and not particularly interesting. There are interesting philosophical ideas brought up about human identity and the soul, and some of the art is pretty. Overall however I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected, primarily, I think, because I didn't really understand what was going on.<br /><br />The plot is very fast and complicated: characters and major themes are introduced very quickly with no time for anything to sink in. Because of this, the movie feels like it never quite gets going and then ends abruptly. Its worth watching, but I wouldn't expect anything amazing.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|So sorry I purchased this item, wish I had rented instead.  Good action, but the story line was so lame!!  I'm so disappointed in the way it turned out...really, destroyed his house & he decides to stay with Pepper instead of using his amazing skills?  How is he supposed to be an Avenger when he destroyed all his suits?

B004P8JPS6|4.0|This was my first exposure to Lee Child and his \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels. I have never seen the movie either so I came into this book with no preconceived expectations, other than a quick read through Childs wikipedia article.<br />I dont usually read popular fiction anymore.To me it is usually trite and downright silly and I have grown to feel like I learned nothing and wasted my time.<br /><br />Not with this book! This book was given to me so I figured I would give \\"popular fiction\\" one more try.<br /><br />I could not put it down after getting a few chapters into it! Child is good at setting landscape and tone. There are flashes of Hemingway in some passages however far-fetched the plot may be at times. The dialoge was good with most characters staying in character and being believable.<br />Some of the violence reminded me of 'Blood Meridian'by Cormac McCarthy and left a very nasty visuals in my mind (good writng IMHO).<br />The sex scenes were exciting even though I was suprised in how erotic Child perpetuated them(more good writing BTW).<br /><br />The sprinkles of clues that neatly tie together through Reachers investigative skills was impressive. I do not read many mysteries,however, so I can not really comment on that part.<br /><br />What I can comment on is this novel kept me engaged and wanting more. I learned a thing or two  reading this book.<br />Child has a new fan in me and I hope the other Reacher novels are as good as this one.<br /><br />I do not think it ruined anything by reading it first;it only left me hungry and wanting more Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Highly recommend it!!
B008RTE066|5.0|First off, I didn't have any of the troubles receiving the EP's in my package that others mentioned.  While not my favorite of the Beatles movies, you get to see a number of great songs performed (well, not sure if performed is the right word) and that is worth the price of admission. The package has some cool extras including the book I remember being in the album I bought growing up.
B00699SDR8|4.0|Interesting makes you think WHO ARE YOU? And it makes philosophy easy to understand and read at a fast pace =)
B00BGI086Q|5.0|I'm not a big comic book fan. I don't know the history of all the incarnations of Oliver Queen. So when I started watching Arrow, I had no expectations other than an action packed show full of stunts and drama. I think the description of the item does a good job outlining what you'll find: Irresponsible playboy Oliver Queen winds up lost at sea and stranded on an island for five years. When he comes back, he's a changed man. He's learned everything in his life is not what it seems, that his father was embroiled in a shadowy plot, and that his family has directly \\"Failed the city\\" of Starling City, Anywhere USA, and he's sworn to avenge the wrongs.<br /><br />Oliver Queen is a complex, fun character and I'm really glad the show gave him a team to work with in the form of bodyguard/drive John Diggle and IT genius and hacker Felicity Smoak (who becomes a series regular for season 2). I think the last 3 episodes of the season really showcase the best of the series and what this team can be in the coming years.<br /><br />Though Arrow tried to build in a romance for Oliver, I much prefer the romantic potential of Oliver and Felicity. I find his worst/lowest moments on the show directly relate to trying to hold on to the past and Oliver's character really suffered for it. I think those were the 2 instances I actively disliked him and I'm hoping the show avoids those pitfalls in the coming season. I don't want to dislike the hero, you know?<br /><br />But Arrow has so many amazing strong points -- the stunt work is fantastic, the action sequences amazing (Darkness on the Edge of Town has a particularly epic one), the visual quality of the show rivals movies in a theater, and let me tell ya... those shirtless work out scenes by Stephen Amell, who plays Oliver Queen, are pretty darned awesome!<br /><br />There are rocky moments for the show. The first few episodes are clearly trying to find their balance. Unfortunately it's hampered by a whiny sister (Thea Queen), a utterly boring ex girlfriend, and too hip looking thug with a heart of gold. The good thing is the show writers clearly were open to tweaking the series as they went along, trying this and that to see if it worked better for viewers, then abandoning the stuff that obviously didn't work. The show has some great actors in Susana Thompson as Oliver's mom, Moira Queen, John Barrowman as the memorizing Malcolm Merlyn, Colin Salmon as Walter Steel, and Paul Blackthorne as Quentin Lance. Other fabulous star make appearances like Seth Gabel as The Count and even Alex Kingston. But by the 5th episode or so Arrow really gets into a groove and each episode is just fun.<br /><br />By the end of the season everything pulls together into an amazing finale that is not at all what you expect (in a good way). There are lots of twists and turns and just when you THINK you know what's going on? You don't. I like a series that can surprise me and Arrow delivers. It's just a fun show that promises to entertain.boring ex girlfriend, and too hip looking thug with a heart of gold.

B00B8YSIMY|4.0|Some novels are meant to be read and others are meant to be experienced.  As a reader who normally reads \\"happily ever after\\" tales, I embarked on this novel as an attempt to deviate from the norm.  Was I ready for such a deviation? No. Fortunately this gutsy novel begins with likable addict Jimmy taking off from England for a new job in Spain - a change he believes will get him clean and sober. I was instantly drawn in by the laid-back writing style of Jams N. Roses, and ready to experience the depths of addiction from its onset all the way through rehab. But Get Clean is not wholly about getting clean and sober. Instead, this well-written story and pragmatic plot slowly and skillfully leads readers into a crime so malevolent, it's difficult to stop reading. Once Jimmy's new Australian friend Jason jumps onboard, I became tense and grossed out several times, but turned pages onto the next chapter with mega anticipation. Kudos to the author for developing this gory crime story in such a way it hooks readers of various genres and has them rooting for clever yet vulnerable, Jimmy (James, Jimbo) even though he does some deplorable things. With intriguing slang and memorable characters (even secondary ones) I felt I was smack in the middle of a place I did not want to be, but like a voyeur, could not detach from what I was seeing through the eyes of this talented author. Way cool characters, but none most would want to hang with in real life. If you enjoy reading about drugs, sex, money, and horrific events that take place in the underground world of addicts, you'll definitely dig  this no holds barred read. And if this isn't your normal genre, do yourself a huge favor and get taken away to a foreign world you'll be talking about for days after you finish the read.<br /><br />I always try not to insert spoilers in reviews, so I'll just say the unexpected twist ending was fantastic!!  British writing rules are different than American, but one quickly becomes accustomed to said language variance.  A handful of editing issues - nothing so egregious I wanted to stop reading, lend this to a 4.5 star review.<br /><br />Get Clean is an adult read and one I highly recommend.o said language variance.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Haven't played the game for long and I can already tell it's gonna be one I come back to a lot.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|I admit, usually game-dev style games are rather tedious, requiring hours of hard work to even begin to become experienced. This particular Kairosoft title, however, keeps with the theme of easy to play, difficult to master, but your first &#34;Hall of Fame&#34; game is incredibly rewarding. With fun game mechanics, an easy interface, and special appearances from famous game developers such as... Shigeto Minamoto? Yes, there are &#34;legendary&#34; developers, buth with rather funny re-spellings applied to their names. Overall, a worthy experience and I recommend this game.
B00005T7I1|3.0|The entire concept of keeping the comic book flavor, characters and look through the entire movie definitely worked.  Dick Tracy is fun to check your brain at the door and enjoy a movie that does good justice to the comic strip that I read for years.  I would have rated it higher but it was the Madonna character (Breathless) that brought it down.  There was simply too much of her.  The songs, the dancing in the club, and &#34;More&#34; got so tiring that I felt it slowed down many fast paced scenes.  I don't think anyone but Warren Beatty could have played and looked the part of Tracy, the Kid was a show stealer, and the makeup on the bad guys was superb.  I don't understand why Madonna thinks that everyone wants to see her with less and less clothing, but her scenes and character actually sickened me.  Having met and worked with a lot of the cast at the Disney debut, Dick Tracy has a personal attachment for me, and know that just about any age would enjoy this movie.

0345530578|1.0|I'm related to an Author- so I'm sensitive to the process - and would never usually downplay or criticize a book.<br />But I MUST in this case.  I was loving the opening and kept on going until I got to the explaination of the main character not knowing of his crime.  He was wired in 4.5 million to his business account and thought someone got too generous with zeros etc.  After SEVERAL months of no reply from the Client, and his partners upset-<br />PLEASE - this would NEVER happen= He sold the client a property- and he knew where the property was located- he and his partners at the law firm would have issued a refund/credit check and HAND DELIVERED it to the client for severely overfunding the account- RIDICULOUS that I'm supposed to sit there reading this thinking that professional lawyers would sit back and let this happen and the very FIRST day they were overfunded would not take swift & calculated actions to defend themselves -- and then months go by - NO WAY - Never possible<br />I sadly could not read beyond this lazy detail .............................................
0744014956|3.0|While the book is invaluable for the maps that show the locations of the Stunt Jumps and Under the Bridge challenges, the rest can be obtained fairly easily online.<br /><br />In fact, there are are 3 side missions that show up after completing the full single player game (depending on the conditions you ended the game with) that aren't even mentioned in the book.<br /><br />Also, there is not a single page devoted to Online, so don't expect any tips on that from this guide.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps the price around $20, it's a decent guide.

0525478817|4.0|I wasn't so much enthralled by the two main characters, Gus and Hazel, although I did learn quite a bit about how young adults handle cancer.  I have no close friends or family who have had cancer, so this was quite educational for me.  However, I loved the role played by the alcoholic and gruff author, van Houten.  His offbeat and quirky commentary really made the book for me, and I found myself craving for more &#34;screen time&#34; for him.  The way his prose made its way into the two main characters' lives, as they face the prospect of early deaths, was cleverly handled.<br /><br />The dialogue between the two main characters - and between themselves and their friends and close family - is totally unrealistic.  No one in an average family or neighbourhood talks like that or can summon up complex prose and witty one-liners like that.  Totally.  But, I decided to cast aside my disbelief, and just enjoy the uniqueness of the conversations.  After all, we've heard enough, and read enough banal conversations in our everyday lives, haven't we?

B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I spent the entire movie trying to figure out the plot-it was that esoteric. Extremely intellectual movie lacking any entertainment value. Someone was obviously trying to make a point in a big way by financing this one, but the point was so obscure I couldn't find it-and I have a 180+ IQ.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I absolutely loved the game.... Then came the update...<br /><br />From now on the breeding is as follows: apples and apples = oranges<br /><br />Also from now on certain rare dragons like Panlong which cost 800 gems (about $70) or took 18 months to get (breed) earn 49% less then before update and 10% less then basic elemental plant dragon (costing peanuts: 100 DV cash!.... You earn that in about 5 min at lv 1 and 5 seconds at lv 25) .... Then there is the paper and other rare with income considerably reduced.<br /><br />And shrines are a decor from now on.... The thing which every player absolutely obsessed about for 2.4 years and spent BILLIONS of DV cash or HUNDREDS of gems ($). This fundamental part of the game that was instrumental in lv dragons and crowning them is worthless.<br />Actually it is worse then worthless, since you can still upgrade it (as some did) without realizing it is only decor from now on and wasted 25 gems (about $15) per upgrade. The compensation of about a hundred gems is laughable.<br /><br />All in all the update is a total disaster. I will not buy another gem till the old breeding rules and dragon earnings are back. Join me and all the others. Maybe if DV has lower cash flow they will hear us!<br /><br />Update:<br />Though I decided to keep playing I have not (and will not) buy any more gems or support the team. Throwing a tons of new time limited dragons at the players is not the way to go to fix the issues or address the boredom of the old-timer players. If you are new player you will be overwhelmed and feel the need to buy gems (for real $$$) to keep up with the dragons you 'need' to get in par with the rest of us, not to mention the new ones you will be sorry to see expire before you have the time to get them.<br /><br />The new magic element/event, don't get me started on that. It has been months since it was released but is still not incorporated in the Colosseum, or the racetrack where all the other elements are represented.<br /><br />It is possible now to lv to 55 but it is unclear if we get 1 extra habitat allowance, though we do get another island. Same-old un-themed boring and completely un-needed island. I have it and it is empty along with the last one island recently re-leased, because I got no habitats to put on them, (habitats being limited to lv and special gem purchased extras.)<br /><br />I do not know if I will get bored enough to quit (I invested too much time and $ into this game) but I have exited other similar games before, so it is possibility. If you are new player consider that it is possible to save enough gems to buy special items, but it will take you up to 3 years to be at 55 with 95% of all dragons (pairs) and 1 of each egg to display, unless you are ready to spend some serious cash./><br />It is possible now to lv to 55 but it is unclear if we get 1 extra habitat allowance, though we do get another island.

B00FEHXCIG|5.0|The action was as good as ever, the villains were a little badder, and Iron man becomes a whole lot more human. It seems to be a slight let down when he is overwhelmed for a while until you see the epiphany is engenders in him.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|worked once...will go thru the motions but no document printed outside of the first one really would like this to work as I have had some PC issues and need to print documents. My printer is set up for use with wireless has the email address to printer set up it worked on my android phone.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The script 's dialogue is so poor that the flash and glamour of the story and the cinematography suffer for it. The sets were gorgeous and DiCaprio was every inch a Gatsby, but he must have cringed at the number of times he had to say Old Sport.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wish it was on TV every night.  Good  clean and wholesome TV.  Thank you for asking me.  Roll on January.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Simply put-an intense and solid story. A page turner. Late to bed just to fin I should reading it and it is a strangely satisfying and unsatisfying ending. No fairy tales here. The best book I've read in a long time. Great character development.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|I love this true story in a movie.  I saw it many years ago and loved it and wanted to get it again to show to my friends...
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love love love it!  So happy I could watch the seasons on line to catch up.<br />Can't wait for the next season.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show! It's easy to get totally entangled in these character's lives! Life at that time was so interesting... a micro-culture in the &#34;house&#34;.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was one of the few who actually read Enders Shadow first years ago. I remember loving it but wanting to read the original to get the full effect. Years later I saw that they were finally making a movie and decided now was as good a time as ever to read the book. And I'm glad I did. Great book, definitely deserving of 5 stars. I just hope the movie delivers the same enjoyment the first books have.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|P.D. James has created a very believable sequel as it were to Miss Austen's story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy after their marriage. All the same wonderful characters are present in this story.  We'll done Ms James.  A great read!
0671449028|5.0|I bought it for a friend at work.  It is enjoyable to read. Good illustrations. Perfect for the really young children.
6305428042|5.0|I love it so much.  All the actors and actresses were perfect in their roles.  It also appeared to be the first movie that Sean Murray (now on NCIS) ever made.  He had that pouty lower lip even then.
067144901X|5.0|I bought it for a friend at work.  It is enjoyable to read. Good illustrations. Perfect for the really young children.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|love it ! you can change the sizes so any age can play and can make  your own degree of difficulty beautiful designs great to keep housemother busy!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great movie!! My toddler kids loved it! My son and daughter couldn't stop laughing during the movie! We were very pleased!
B00CXQL828|5.0|that is all...buy it! I listen to this album everyday and can not wait until the new one comes out
B004LROUW2|2.0|Although it feels like an accomplishment to finish this book, I fear it might not have been worth the struggle. Murakami's wandering descriptions of food preparation and mental confusion left me wanting to escape 1Q84. Though there are genuinely intriguing plot devices woven into the structure of this epoch, their magic qualities are worn threadbare through the simplistic and detailed idiocy of the main characters.<br /><br />At this point I've completely discredited my opinion with overuse of highfalutin vocabulary, but I beg you as a fellow cautious optimist to read something else if you're seeking an enjoyable experience.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Great Acting, story line developed a little slow and picked up pace towards the end and now we cant' stop the series!
B000U6BT40|3.0|Nerdy sci-fi comedy/drama set in present-day USA, with decent visual effects. Witness the trials and tribulations of an ex-US marshal turned town Sheriff in the weird town of Eurika, home to the fictional Global Dynamics corporation, which researches lots of weird tech. Lots of fiddling with time-travel, mind-control, and side-effects of mysterious artifacts.<br /><br />Far more shallow than Babylon 5 or Battlestar Galactica, or even DS9 in terms of story arc, bit enjoyable nonetheless. In later seasons it joins up with Warehouse 13, in the same universe.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Don't like that they make you post to Facebook. Plus you have to spend real money to complete some goals. :(<br /><br />Besides those and some other little things, the game is fun.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I love Michael Connelly's writing style and love reading this series! Very down to earth, and a lot of good twists and turns to keep you wanting the see how it ends! I look forward to reading anything Michael writes. He's my kind of writer!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|except for the title and zombies.  pretty cheesy acting.  i am required to type 11 more words, so here they are.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|TFIOS is absolutely amazing, and you should read it any chance you get. I hate ready with a passion, and the fact that I'm saying this, makes you know that this book is just that awesome,if it got me to actually read a 300+ paged book:)
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Great finale to the series. Action packed, fun to watch, emotional and humorous at the same time, everything a great movie should be.
B00013M6NK|4.0|The OEM battery works fine. As an exact replacement should. I would not recommend the cheaper generic brands since I've always had problems with them.
0425267695|5.0|I had pretty high hopes for this book when I started it as the reviews are almost completely positive and the subject matter is right up my alley. I am happy to report that I was not disappointed at all.  Plain and simple, this book is fantastic.  Anthony Ryan does such a terrific job creating the main character and shaping him throughout, you feel that you know him better than any one else in the story.  You follow him from a young boy to a fierce and renown warrior leading armies into battle.  You grow intimately familiar with the main character, Vaelin Al Sorna, as well as some of his closest friends.  It's been a long time since I've grown so fond of a collection of characters throughout a story.  Obviously, the characters are incredibly strong, especially Vaelin, the story may be even better and the mechanism through which it is told is highly effective and offers two different viewpoints, though one much more than the other.  The book rarely lulls and I was always anxious to see what would happen next. Even though this is the first of a series, the ending was very satisfying, leaving me eager for the sequel, but still closing many of the loose ends and tying things up nicely.  This is incredibly nice as many series tend to have frustratingly abrupt cliff hanger endings to be continued in the next installment of the story.<br />If you read any of The King Killer Chronicle (The Name of the Wind or The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss), the two are incredibly similar.  While Blood Song offers significantly more action, the stories are homologous in their narratives, as well as the \\"boy to a legend\\" story structure, so if you enjoyed Rothfuss' works (if you haven't read them, they are very good too) then you will almost definitely enjoy this as well.<br />I highly recommend this book to any fantasy lover, it is exactly what I love about fantasy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I liked this game I think it's fun to play. I advise other people to<br />play to. Also I think it's fun for all ages.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It got more interesting as I progressed through the book.  There were quite a few characters but I thought it was well written.  I would recommend it.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|At 47, I suppose I am old and cynical, which is why I am so surprised that I can still be moved by something as beautiful and wondrous as this album. I'm not a music \\"expert\\", I can't tell you why Birdy's  music has the effect on me, I only know that when I listen to her, she takes me back to being young again. And I feel peace that brings me close to tears; tears of joy.<br /><br />Wonderful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game in the world. I love it! It is realy creative and fun. I hope you injoy this game because it is epic.
B008RNGCAO|3.0|Meh. I feel &#34;meh,&#34; but they require a review of at least 20 words. But &#34;meh&#34; just about sums it up.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|Great game. Interesting format: RPG elements combined with puzzle game. But the puzzle element is ever changing and can be customized. Different characters, different challenges, good story. Both my wife and I love it and we can't stop playing. The only bad thing is that the game keeps track of the time you have spent playing and every time you start playing again you are reminded of just how much of your life you have spent playing this game (a lot).
B001BANK32|5.0|After reading dr sleep I had to read the shining as I had only seen the movie yrs ago. I'm so glad I did.
B002N7RAH4|5.0|I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and this is one of my favorites.  A definite must see if you love comedies with big explosions and crazy townsfolk.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|tried this out and its not up to snuff. its rather clumsy and wanders around aimlessly.... needs more intuitivenss in design.
B003V9OCS8|4.0|Had to Google this Eiger mountain and read the story before I finished watching the movie. I had to find out what happened since it was based on a true story. I was rooting for the climbers throughout the movie.  Great location and scenery to shoot a movie. I recommend this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|not 5 stars but really close.  I use it to convert metric values to standard weights and measures, well done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved all three Seasons.  Ordered them from Amazon.Com and was very pleased with their service.  I would surly order from them again.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragon vale is the best game and for that, I am so thankful for adding magic and keeping my dragons and levels @ the same time!!!<br />  Thank you and God bless you as well.<br />  - Tanner gross
B007712XAU|5.0|I had missed this show on T.V. and convinced myself that I really did not miss much.  However, listening to friends I started to get a little curious as to what this show was all about.  I ordered this set and also Season 3.  I watched it at my own pace at the beginning but by the last Season I was completely hooked and could not stop watching until the last scene in Season 3 was complete, staying up until 3a.m.  I did love this whole series.  It is so brilliantly performed and the costumes are exquisite. The scenery is breathtaking at times.  Everything about this program is superb. Loved, loved, loved it!  Cannot wait for the next Season
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I only read the first few pages and wasn't! To impressed with the story. W no enjoys reading about teen age sex? not me.
1612680011|5.0|I liked this book and I bought it for my daughter hoping that she would begin to think about money in a constructive way.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|No further explanation needed other than 5 stars!  Great series and great cast! I would recommend this series to serious drama fans.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is always a good game to just pass the time. It's not a favorite but sometimes it satisfy the need when I am bored.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Love it! Has the Revised New World Translation and is in epub format. Also it has 5 other bible translations built into it so you can instantly see those translate that same verse. It also contains wonderful footnotes, and an outline of each of the Bible books at their beginning. Has many other features as well...and in one word...this thing is truly...&#34;awesome!!&#34;
B000ICXQGK|5.0|This movie is based on reports of an afterlife from people who have had near death experiences. Action is consistant  with many of the NDE reports that I have studied, including my own. Only major difference is that there is no hell. I suspect that hell was added for dramatic affect.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This isnt so much as a rating as it is a complaint about a problem with the login. When i try to log into this game (first off dont tell me i put the login info wrong cause i didnt) it just sits there on the page saying `Connecting…` and doesnt do s***. (pardon my french i am very frustrated right now) Can anyone help?
B001UTW7QU|4.0|new creative twist for science fiction, as others have remarked it starts out slow, but becomes so good you cannot wait to see the next one!<br />Nancy from Columbus, ohio
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|My 20 year old son and group of friends loved show so I watched it and had to agree!! I would recommend.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|In contrast to the earlier Angry Bird releases, it appears you have to make purchases in order to play.  That's a big fat ZERO to me.  Uninstalled within minutes.  Good riddance.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|This is one of our family's favorite Disney movies. A wonderful story about love, loyalty, and being good, with an Elvis soundtrack!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game !!!!!! I use it to help me unwind and it is wonderful. Unlike other solitaire apps I have tried it does not flash bright annoying adds in your face while your playing. Got headaches from the others but not from this one.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Aslan does a reasonable job attempting to separate the historical facts about Jesus from what appears to have been later embellishment. What he does so well is paint a picture of the politics of first century Palestine creating a context for Jesus' message that makes it even more powerful. It's also a very readable book and held my interest. It's not weighted with a academic jargon, but moves right along. However, he glossed over the resurrection. It's not that he denied it. He just didn't explore it. As much as I enjoyed the book, the resurrection is at the heart of Christianity and something that raises questions that cry out for more discussion. Some critics have suggested that Aslan, a Muslim, could not write an unbiased academic work on Jesus, but I didn't see any such bias.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is so funny you don't want to put it down. I read it in one night. And after you read it you realize it is full of such practical wisdom. Can't recommend it highly enough.
0316204366|2.0|This read was eagerly anticipated with high expectations based on Gladwell's other books - all of which were interesting, introduced new ideas, and served as a basis for lively conversations with my friends.  \\"David and Goliath\\" does not live up to his previous standard of excellence.<br />There is only one well-supported new idea presented; everything else is already known or intuitive.  Most proofs are case-based and not supportive to his generalizations.  Documentation was a strong suit in previous works, but here he skips around, fails to present convincing evidence for some assertions, and relies on dramatic individual examples.  The writing is entertaining and the stories inspirational, but I didn't get many of the \\"ah-ha!\\" insights gleaned from earlier works.<br />I look forward to a better next effort.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|I looooovvee this movie!!!! Can't wait to go and see the second which is out now (machete kills) and third one which I still gotta wait for (machete kills again)
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Not bad, watchable , a little boring, not enough, not your regular Tom Cruise movie needed more action for viewer
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Ok this game is good, yes you go back and forth slot, but the hint button helps you! When u get confused or not sure where to go the hint button will lead u.. I liked that very much.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Was action filled great picture to see hopefully will not be the first in a long line of Star Trek movies
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This new version is amazing, I have all three and love playing them ! Thank you for this awesome app :)
B008D28HYS|5.0|I can't get enough of this game.  I have the black and white version and color version on my iPhone.  When I saw it for the Kindle, I couldn't wait to download.  Definitely a challenge, but enjoy it very much.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I tore through this book in a few hours, drawn deeper and deeper into the unfolding drama. I loved the unique format: two narrators, one dead and recounting on cassette tapes the reasons she committed suicide, the other the boy listening to the tapes and wondering how he fits into the terrible story. The writing was concise, the plot moved at a very quick pace, and the characters were well-crafted, especially Hannah, the protagonist. She was flawed, which made for an interesting choice, presenting the heroine of the book as sort of an anti-heroine.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt almost no emotional connection to the characters at all. Perhaps this is because I'm way past high school age, but it might also have to do with the fact that self-pity is a real turn off for me. I would have liked it better if she'd decided to turn her rage outward instead of killing herself in response to all the jerks in her life. But teen suicide in response to bullying is a serious subject and it was handled well in this story, giving the reader a glimpse into the mind and heart of a girl intent on self destruction, and the things that led her to that place. I would definitely read other works by this talented author.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|No overly dramatic music, no totally outlandish chase scenes, no murder-by-the-minute....just good, solid story-telling and some exceptional acting with an interesting and sustainable plot line.
B00594XOZU|1.0|My kik is being really sucky i try to log in then it takes a long time to load then it says i need to 'try again later.'<br /><br />It works perfectly fine on a i pod but on a kindle no. It's mocking me telling me I'm stupid. And that is what i have to say. I lost way too many friends because of this... thanks a lot kik!! :D
B001URCM44|5.0|This is my favorite background music. It is used on both of my Kindles (3rd generation and Fire). The purchase was simple. I'm playing it right now.
0316056898|5.0|I laughed so hard reading this book (mainly because I can see elements of my own crazy stressful life). Love her trademark self-deprecating humor!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Profound writing and good acting draw you in.  A really creepy show.  Looking forward to Season 2.<br /><br />T. Reilly<br />Buffalo, NY
B004XZR63M|5.0|After reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, it gave me great insight and lead me to start redeveloping my way of thinking when it comes to my finances. The book gives building blocks on how to formulate your strategies to build your financial empower
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|I grew up watching this movie with my grandmother (weird but true) - believe it or not it brought back childhood memories!
B00CY0JY88|4.0|Like the author says I read this trilogy because I  wanted something similar to 50 shades, but at frist I foud this book to similar to50 shades but as I kept reading it I began to like it to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game for little kids! I'm 10 years old and I still play it. I love this game. it teaches u how to jump on trains, but never jump on trains.;)
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|If you were around in the 70's & liked THE BAND, this is a trip down memory lane.<br />If not, listen to this & learn what it was like to hear good, raw rock & roll at its best.l
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Good app.  Works well.  I would recommend to any one.  Especially good if u have a child that uses your kindle.
B00C061I3K|5.0|How this guys can come back with such a great album???<br /><br />Just buy it! you wont regret it!<br /><br />Don't miss Giorgio Moroder Tribute!
B005P06AAO|5.0|I started watching this on MTV when it aired and LOVED IT.  My husband and I are both in our early thirties and both thought this series was hilarious!  Ordered the box set because we loved the show so much and wanted to keep watching it while we waited for season 2.  I'm sad to say that season 2 did not do it for me....I was sad, I thought it was going to fizzle out, but they did redeem themselves with season 3...lets see what season 4 has to offer.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Thank you for the great service, it was in excellent shape. Great Show! I do want the Season 4 when it comes out.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Enough said.....Great Band, Great Album!  I knew only &#34;Little Lion Man&#34; when I ordered this album, but the whole thing proved to be great!  Love this band, can't wait to see them live one day.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|trying apps to fix settings on my tablet.randomly picked this one.didnt load at all.no an app i would use in any way.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This book seemed to drag on with no point to it.  Not until the final few chapters was it clear where the story was going and what the auther wanted to convey.  Dissapointing after reading The Kite Runner.
B000MR1V22|5.0|It has a little bit of everything,  funny, happy, sad, and the end was great, the characters fit together in a crazy way.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read the books before the movie came out and as expected, the books are better.  The movie was not bad either.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Donoghue weaves an exquisite tapestry of sensory experience from a child's perspective. Richness in extreme austerity. A testament to the strength of the human spirit and the will to survive. More than a good story, the author gifts the reader with a new perspective on the most common elements of our lives.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Love this book and the characters.  This story is one of many of the abuse of not only the Jewish people but of the struggles the German people as well.
B00EP0KYDO|2.0|Not a bad story. Slightly distracting in its unbelievable elements. Great special affects. But all of this is plagued by the bad acting of the younger Smith. An annoying turn by him that distracts fully from the positive qualities of the film.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like it at home, but had trouble navigating to where I wanted to be at church during the serman when the pastor referred to other scriptures.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|I watch this movie all the time.  It is my favorite of the Austin movies.  Such a beautiful story with the reality of the times .  And the heroine always comes out in the end.  Great casting.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Wow. I found Tommy while reading about Chet Atkins. I can't believe I spent all those years not knowing about this guy. Absolutely amazing. I'm not too sure why I bought DVD instead of a CD but I'm sure glad I did. \\"Australia's answer to Chet Atkins\\". What this guy can do finger picking a \\" white man's thunder stick\\" brings tears to my eyes.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I read this book was about a girl with cancer, I almost didn't buy it. Who wants to be depressed? But John Green managed to write a book about a cancer survivor that was both funny and insightful--and not in a cheesy insightful kind of way, but in a real, it makes you stop and think kind of way. I loved, loved, loved Hazel Grace Lancaster, and I think there's something in this book for everyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has got to be my favorite series ever.  I love the time period, and I love English dramas.  If anyone enjoys quality programing in the British form I recommend this highly.  Even though it makes me cry from time to time and aggravates as well, I still enjoy and can hardly wait to see the next season.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|I enjoy all of Ms. Hobb's books.  This is second reading of this series.  I am never disappointed in any of her writings.  Love the characters.  Hate to finish a finish a series!
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|Facing issues to open or view the product in amazon , doesn't appear on my list to get it back !!!
B00CHVJI08|5.0|i love the belt plush soooooo soft and the movie is great perfect for any kids of all ages love playing with it
B007FG9LIE|5.0|For thriller suspense fans this one delivers big time. There's some SF Twilight Zone aspects that may not appeal to some but the suspense and action should keep you riveted even if that's not your particular bag. Due to the nature of the story, I won't divulge any details. The only downers are that it ends and that it's the first of a series. I just finished the second book Wayward Pines and loved that one too although I thought Pines had more page turning suspense. Pines is good enough to stand alone - but chances are you'll go for the rest. The third is due out in 2014 and I'm looking forward to it.
B0098QAAAC|5.0|Both deep & light hearted, this film will definitely have you doing some soul searching by the time the credits roll.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|Read this in advance of the movie coming out.  Provided a good understanding of the person as well as the forces behind the efforts to end aparthied.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|Reacher always provides a fast action story with plenty of twists. Great to read another Reacher story and happy to recommend!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Keeps you entertained.  The only down side is getting distracted by the multiple scenarios.  All the creatures moving around gets annoying and I don't like running out of energy.  I'm not one to purchase anything with real money.
1444777556|5.0|I loved James' first book, A Street Cat named Bob, so much that I had to read this book as well, but then I was afraid I might not love it as much, but I was not disappointed!  James writes with such honesty and I can tell what he is writing is coming from his heart.  I'm hoping there will be a third Bob book!  Well done, James and give Bob a hug for me.  He is adorable!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Everything was as promised and delivered as promised.  Wonderful complete set without a lot of extras tat I didn't want.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My son &#34;earned&#34; this app for work done in a timely manner :-)<br /><br />He loves his xBox version of this game, but is happy with this version too.<br /><br />He hasn't complained about anything; so I think that is good.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|While I didn't necessarily agree with some of the acting interpretations in the film, it was sure refreshing to see the characters done differently with new life breathed into this classic. The modernization worked just fine and the unpretentious acting made the characters lovable. A great film that is very rewatchable.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Interesting time period. Compelling, but some characters quite one dimensional. Sets and costuming are gorgeous. Loved Shirley McClain. Will watch again.
B007HOOAH6|5.0|I love Patricelli's style: her books have simple drawings and few words, leaving a lot of room for parents to fill in the story as they wish. In this case, the story is pretty clear, and those words that are included are perfect. After 2 readings, my son is shouting \\"I DID IT!\\" after using his potty, and laughs every time we get to the \\"tinkle, tinkle, toot!\\" page. He was growing tired of using the potty, and this book has certainly re-inspired him to get back on the throne.
B005XUC398|5.0|Fast paced, a great movie for all ages.  Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and he was great in this movie
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is one of the best pastimes on the web. Love  to spend my Saturday mornings looking at other people's pins and then going to the sites to see other things to pin on my site.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is great. Just enough difficulty to be challenging, but not unsolvable.  I have a hard time putting it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is thrilling tells the story better and has better description s of the characters then the first book a lot more
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|My grandchildren love this game.  Just watching them play let's me know it's a keeper. Will definitely look for more games that they like.
B0028OF7TA|5.0|Excelent box set with the king of the Pop !!<br />it's worth buying, especially collectors !!<br />Just hoped there were bonus tracks
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This is a great book. I have never cried from a book but i did in this. I cried because of the thought of release. Jonas's dad the Nurturer does not even know that he is killing babies. It is sad and painful to think about killing innocent babies just because they are twins. The townspeople all run away from confusion, pain, love, and family just because they are scared. They depend on the Reciever to hold memories when they can share the memories together. These people have no idea what they are doing. There is no Elsewhere. There is Heaven and Hell.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the app, just has some issues of freezing up sometimes. Great pictures including animals and landscapes. Good for all ages.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story is incredible.  Told through Pat's eyes, Quick is able to make the reader feel the emotion, the ups and downs, and the hope that the main character feels. It took me about a week, but I could've easily finished it in a day and a half, minus other responsibilities. I couldn't put it down!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|After buying one of these I purchased another if that tells you anything. I use on televisions for headphones.  They work really well and I like they are so small.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|It was okay a little disjointed at times and the kids acting wasn't up to par. Will Smith did an okay job too although his character didn't have a lot of emotion I would think that he would've been able to play the person without fear without Playing a person without emotion
B001N9ESQ4|2.0|Very Boring,  not as goos as the first part and haven´t see the third part which has not been out
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|and it fully deserves to be short-listed for the Man Booker - it is a Dickensian novel of grand proportions with great characters and a fascinating plot line.  Hard to put down.

B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|I was a little apprehensive ordering this, but everyone else raved about her. She is so much cuter out of the package than in the pictures. My 5 year old daughter is in love with her and carts her around everywhere. A great purchase!
0385743564|4.0|This is an imaginative and exciting novel that takes place in a futuristic world made of metal. A cruel group of beings called Epics are reeking havoc on innocent people. These beings have individually unique super powers as well as some weakness that can bring them down. Fighting against them are a band of people known as reckoners who are trying to break the grasp of the insidious overlords. The book is action packed and I can't imagine a teenage boy that wouldn't fail to captivated by this fast paced adventure.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|The same stuff you would hear if you took the most successful guy in town to lunch....but it's coming from a billionaire, and you are getting a LOT more information. I heard him on an interview that he isn't making a dime from this.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I think the premise is interesting, but there's so much bouncing around with the characters, it takes a good share of the book before you realize who you're reading about.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Pretty good movie to be such a low budget one. I wish so much they would make an epic Halo Movie like they did the Man of Steel, one can hope I guess.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Different from what I normally read but the bizarre rendering of alternate worlds kept me reading and thinking to the very end.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper gives us a sad but heartwarming view of the woman who fall through the cracks of the justice system.
B002LLOZYI|5.0|I am hooked on this series.  I was way behind and have been vuying one season at a time and find myself watching one a night.  I am up to season 5.  I think the casting is wonderful and I like the way it moves along through the changes that came with the years, which, at age 71, I can tell you are pretty accurate.  The dress, manners, smoking, women's evolution, etc.  Very fun to watch when you can recgonize them.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|Amazon never disappoints me with any purchase... I can watch all the episodes commercial FREE!!! Thank you Amazon for bringing my favorite shows to my PC screen
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This season was great. Donna, the Doctor's companion for this season, is different from the other companions. She is more mature and is always questioning  the Doctor. David Tennant is one of the better actors to have played the Doctor.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Challenging and fun!  You have to think about your next move.  The ability to change the bubble to another color that's already in the cauldron makes it even more fun.  Avoiding those spider bubbles can be very difficult!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love playing the game but I'm disappointed that I can't get the Halloween version/update on my kindle fire HD.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Great story, characters and animation. A spaghetti western with humor and a twist. Funny dialog that will sometimes be over a kids head.

B001A5HBAG|5.0|First time watching this show, very interesting!  I would highly recommend this show to someone!  Great learning about past times in advertising!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci at his best.  This was a first time for a new character in his writing, and Will Robie is a compelling figure.  I have read most of Baldacci's books, and this one is in the top few.  Don't start it unless you can devote some serious time.  I found myself having to go back and catch up on the story before moving forward.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I love this book! I didn't expect to love it so much. I read this book for school but man, what a great story! The story of Jane and Mr. Rochester is definitely one of the greatest. It is right there next to Pride and Prejudice, one of my other favorites. Just give it a try!!!
0316204366|4.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HLX57I4 An Executive Summary of Malcolm Gladwell's 'David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants']]<br /><br />This book is not about underdogs and giants in any conventional sense of these terms. Rather, the book is about the curious nature of advantages and disadvantages, and how each can (under certain circumstances) become its opposite.<br /><br />The first lesson to be learned is that the things we take to be advantages are often no such thing. Our greatest mistake here comes from the fact that we identify a certain quality or characteristic as being a benefit or advantage, and then assume that the more of it there is the better--when this is often not the case. Put another way, most of us recognize that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, and yet we fail to appreciate just how often and where this principle applies. For instance, we recognize that having a certain amount of money greatly facilitates raising children (it being very difficult to raise a family in a state of poverty), and yet we fail to recognize that beyond a certain point wealth also makes parenting increasingly difficult (for it becomes harder and harder to instill qualities of hard work and self-control). Or we recognize that small class sizes are a good thing, and yet we fail to recognize that classes can actually begin to suffer once they become too small (since diversity and energy begin to disappear).<br /><br />Another arena wherein an advantage can become a disadvantage is in power and authority. Power and authority is an advantage, of course; however, when it is wielded illegitimately and without fairness, it can actually cause more chaos, destruction and violence than it curbs. This is as true in the classroom as it is in community policing as it is in handling minority groups within a nation's borders.<br /><br />The second lesson to be learned here is that certain disadvantages can sometimes drive people into positions of advantage. Take the disadvantage of being born with a disability, for example. Say dyslexia. In our modern world, where the ability to read is extremely important--and practically a requirement for success--having great difficulty with reading is a major disadvantage. And indeed the statistics indicate that the vast majority of those who are born dyslexic end up falling through the cracks and missing out on success.<br /><br />Still, though, many dyslexics have gone on to become highly successful people; and it has also been noted that in certain fields (such as entrepreneurship) an inordinate proportion of the most successful individuals do, in fact, have dyslexia. So how can we explain these success stories? What we find in these cases is that these individuals have managed to compensate for their disability by developing skills that make up for their flaws (such as an improved memory or debating prowess). Thus, in a way, the successful dyslexic has actually benefited from his disability, because it has forced him into a position where he has had to develop other skills that have led him directly to success.<br /><br />Also at play here is the fact that dyslexics tend to endure many failures when they are young. Repeated failures (especially at a young age) have the potential to crush the spirit. But they can also have the opposite effect: they can inure the individual to failure, thus making them more likely to take risks and try things that others wouldn't--which is often a sure path to success.<br /><br />A similar phenomenon also sometimes touches trauma victims. Take the ultimate trauma of losing a parent in childhood, for example. This is one of the worse experiences imaginable, and the trauma of losing a parent in childhood does indeed crush the vast majority of those who have the misfortune of enduring it.<br /><br />Again, though, it has been noted that a very high proportion of highly successful individuals across manyfields (from science to art to politics) have in fact lost a parent in childhood.  And what we find in these cases is that the experience has left these individuals with the mind-set that now that they have endured such a terrible event, that nothing could ever be so bad. And thus they are liberated from the fear of failure, and--like the successful dyslexic--are willing to try things and take risks that others are not (which often leads directly to success).<br /><br />The same experience and logic can also apply to underdog groups. For example, when a group recognizes that it is severely over-matched in terms of skill or strength compared to its opponent, it can begin to feel liberated to try unconventional tactics and approaches. This is often for the best, for it turns out that unconventional tactics and approaches are frequently very effective against giants--in everything from sports, to politics to war--and are, in many cases, the only chance the underdog has to win anyway. Again, then, in both of these instances (the trauma victim and the underdog group) a disadvantage has driven the party into a position of advantage, and thus the disadvantage may itself be seen as a kind of boon.<br /><br />Gladwell has done well to make us rethink the nature of advantages and disadvantages across many fields. The only major flaw in the book, in my view, is the third and final part. The theme of the part is that power becomes less effective (or even counter-productive) when it is wielded illegitimately. The problem with this argument is that it's a classic case of the straw-man: Gladwell has set up an opposition that is very easy to defeat, and then smashed it to pieces. What's worse is that the examples Gladwell uses to prove his point here are quite weak. Still, there is much of value in the first 2 parts of the book.

B00F35BV64|3.0|This movie is just simply way overdone.  They could have let up on a few things and the movie would have been fine.  Also, using the phrase \\"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\\" in every movie?  This gets old fast.  And what's with people flying all which way when the Enterprise is doing a free fall straight into Earth?  For any intelligent person out there who understands physics, when you're in an object that's in free fall, you are also in free fall, accelerating at the same rate as what Earth's gravity pulls on you, meaning you are weightless, ZERO G, again WEIGHTLESS, not flying all over the place.  And with that many torpedoes hitting the Enterprise, everyone would have been dead.  All the explosions were WAY overdone.  And did Spock REALLY have to be in the middle of all sorts of magma to make the movie a semi-hit?  Again, way overdone.
B004KPX4W2|1.0|Just one of the stupidest movies I ever watched. Can Hollywood get any worse? CIA, \\"Mother Russia\\", Good guys, Bad guys, Shooting, Explosions

Ant interest you have you can pin, you can also create pins with your own pictures or with something off a website.
3836532441|5.0|I purchased this book because it was recommended to me by pin up photographers and models alike. As a photographer I love this book, it is full of pictures that help to pose models and create scenes that are true to the pin up era.

Spent a couple of hours scouring the internet looking for solutions. Tried some recommended changes to my router, nothing. Spent an hour on the phone with Google, they were very nice, but they seemed like they were surfing the web looking at the same problem resolutions I had already tried. I mean a Fios router??? I know there are probably a hundred different types, but really??? It's Verizon!!!<br />Tried connecting via a PC, Mac Pro, Moto Android,.... nothing. Probably try a Roku...

B0094BB4TW|1.0|This worked briefly and now it simply shows random updates to news feed in no logical order. There is no option I can find to select between Most Recent or Important. Also the images are too large for the screen unless you tap them, then you have to back page to continue viewing the newsfeed. Facebook works much better on my Android phone. I'll be uninstalling this I think.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Had my Chromecast for a couple of weeks now and really don't know why you wouldn't want one. Netflix, Hulu+, more coming and just about anything from your desktop or laptop, Even my wife who is not into tech has grown to love it watching several shows and movies. Would love to see Amazon Prime sorted out better but even using Googlecast from the browser is very workable. For $35 what's not to like.<br /><br />Raymond

B006LSZECO|3.0|The beginning of this story takes a while to develop, but once you are hooked it digs its claws in and won't let go until you are done! The writer does an excellent job of providing some very thought provoking themes and tying in wonderful elements of suspense, leaving few (if any) pieces unturned. You find yourself trying to decide who to dislike more between characters, which adds an interesting dynamic in how you read and the ultimate conclusions that you make.<br /><br />I think I approached this book as a mystery and in that aspect I was slightly disappointed; HOWEVER (!), I was rewarded with the other psychological aspects involved that were in many ways more rewarding than a typical mystery - where you marvel at the sheer ingenuity (or luck) of the detectives solving a case and try to best them at their game. In this story you marvel at the people plotting the case and are in awe of the sheer magnitude of the planning and inconceivable craziness of it all.<br /><br />The first half may take a while to get into because the forward teases you that things are not as they seem, so you find yourself waiting and flipping pages until these things become apparent and solid. Right when I thought I had figured it all out and a logical conclusion, the plot took an entirely different direction - one that took it to another level and kept the pages turning.<br /><br /><<<<<<SPOILER ALERT>>>>><br /><br />My main beef (SPOILER TO FOLLOW!!!) was the deviation in characterization of Amy in the second half of the book. She sticks to her sociopath personality to the \\"T\\" until her new companions in the middle of no-where figure out how to steal her survivor cash stash. Even though she is \\"Dead Amy\\" - she is still ultimately the cunning Amy that stages the whole affair and continues to think every aspect out to the end of the book. You think she could really be conned and not see two low-lives plotting to take her cash?? No way!! I fully expected her to seek her ultimate revenge(as she did with multiple people in her life), but was disappointed as it seemed this mischaracterization was not to plunge further in to the depths of her psychosis but merely a device by the writer to take the story back to the center, where it ultimately had to end.<br /><br />I titled this review and rated as I did because I enjoyed where the story took me and even though it may have made me feel a little \\"yucky\\" at the end I can appreciate the writing (even though a little over-written at times) and the general story. Did it have the happy ending I desire in a book? No. But the point was that there was no way to a happy ending because of the toxic relationship two people had created. In a way, did either of them deserve a happy ending? That is the real question.
1781162646|5.0|...it's also a fun read. I quickly found myself pulled into this world of the main character Devin's days as a lovesick young adult trying to grasp his place in the world working at an old time carnival. While there were trademark elements of Stephen King horror in the book (including one of the creepiest dream sequences I've ever read in my life) overall the book was more of a coming of age tale, and character driven. And best of all the end was more than satisfying, wrapping up things nice and neat right down to the last sentence. Well done!
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|The eternal Purple releases this elaborated album full with arrangements that sometimes are difficult to understand even to the deepest purple fans, that is why i dont give it 4 stars, it is a solid album with 4 very good songs and the rest of the songs are just ok and unnesessarily complicated.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye flips the genre once again. Don't listen to people who hate it and simply write it off as 'noise-rap'. This is the most avant-garde thing in mainstream hip hop for some time now, that's for sure, but even if you hate on first listen, give it some time and it might just grow on you.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|I will miss these guys, I know they are quite old now and i wish they could be on stage forever like the Stones or Purple but i am pleased to have watched their show live a 4 times including this Epitah tour witch is a Fan pleaser Tour because they played the most voted songs by the fans. The sound and video quality in this BD is the best, the show is very good. I remember watching the show in Mexico city´s sports palace and i was expecting Halford´s voice to be weak and age worn, but surprisingly for me it was powerful and could reach the lowest chords of the songs, this BD captures that, seems like he worked out his voice for this tour. If you like heavy metal, u must have this one.

B00915G6SU|3.0|I also have every season on DVD.  Season 8 is not up to par basically because of the casting of Jeanne Tripplehorn as the new agent.  She has no personality, no chemistry with the team and is pretty much dull, dull, dull.  Whoever casted her must have been hungover that day.  She needs to go.

As you BELIEVE is it done unto you...famous words and so true.
B00ESNE696|5.0|I just love this show, can hardly manage the wait from week to week, can't wait to see what develops with Diane / Will/ Alicia  stick so many aspects and plots within the story Love it
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I saw a television presentation of this album and immediately after ordered it.  I play it over and over and just love it.  Despite the artistry of everyone on it, I don't know whether all ages would like and appreciate it or not, because it is a reminiscence of an older time.  The famous Beatles humor is still there, though, in the title and in some of the song selections.  No more hints--go listen!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun time killer. Nice graphics. Looking forward to the next version. Dnot often give five stars but this ouch is a winner
1427210241|5.0|Enjoyed the book, this is the last of the series. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the sci-fi books.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I dunno, maybe I didn't read that description close enough, just saw Neil Gaiman and was like, 'game on.' This reads like a Narnia book. Very linear, very fantasy, characters who you can't quite believe. Very derivative of the Dark is Rising books.
B0001I55OC|4.0|Stars before they made it big... This was a movie I was glad to purchase. We enjoyed the movie and the plot was good. Delivery was faster than expected. Arrived in great condition.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Was not expecting such a mature, intelligent, and borderline premonitive story. This is not whimsical scifi—it's smart and great, and probably the best debut science fiction novel since snow crash.

B0049J3QAY|5.0|Good movie for all ages in the family. Love the fact that the soundtrack is instrumental, mostly jazz, as this helps the kids appreciate various genres of music.

Signature was both beautiful and thought provoking...I have never met such a woman as Alma; it is safe to say she will be in my mind for a long time. When I review a book, I never mean to dissect it. I mean to tell whomever might be reading this the feeling it gave me. I stayed awake until 4am yesterday and 2am tonight reading this book. My feeling was I simply did not want to put it down...yet ones children must eat and the like.<br />I will say, the last third of the book was a tad slower for me, but not in a tedious way. I felt as if Gilbert came out of the gate running and toward the end, paced herself a bit more. Near the very end of the book was a conversation between two characters that I feel privy to be a part of. Okay, no more time to waste! Get on your own wonderous journey and discover this reads many treasures!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I will admit that it is hard to impress me. I am typically critical of a book before I even open it. After reading a lot of mixed reviews on this book, I wasn't sure what to expect and decided to purchase it anyway. I'm glad I did! This book was well written with believable and lovable characters. I couldn't put it down. After finishing this book, I immediately had to purchase the next one.
6304712936|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the 80 I loved somethings about it, I'd say most of it, especially the way Mozart's music comes to life.  I was taken aback though by the clownish, childish, simplistic portrayal of one of my life's heroes  My reading of Wolfi's Epistolary and other biographies gave me a very different view of the man. A very committed political activist, a rebel against authoritarianism, a free-mason at the time when such affiliations were as dangerous as being labeled a jihadist today.  It was the time of transition from absolute Monarchy to bourgeois \\"democracy\\".  The Emperor's stance against \\"Figaro\\" is the only mention of the political instability of the moment.  His sister Marie Antoinette was guillotined in this political transition.<br />It was Amadeus' clownish giggle that bugged me most.<br />Well, this time, my partner Julie said to me to watch the movie as seen from Salieri's mind.  This helped, Salieri in this story sees Wolfi as a clown, but also sees his musical genius. Salieri can't have any appreciation for anything else in Mozart, his politics, his deep love, for women, children, friends and students (yes, Mozart had many students).  The pain in his heart at the suffering all around him.  His sexuality..... (and of course, the mainstream US culture also seems to have difficulty appreciating the positive value of sensuality and sexuality; we all struggle with this one,) and passion.<br /><br />I recommend three books to get a broader perspective:<br />Maynard Salomon's biography \\"Mozart\\" [[ASIN:B000ROKXXS Mozart A Life ebook]]<br />Möricke's \\"Mozart on His Journey to Prag\\" [...]<br />and finally the book that Shaffer based his play on by Alexander Pushkin \\"Mozart and Salieri\\"<br /><br />Submitted with love and respect.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Seriously, I don't write long reviews, but I'll say this. Robots and monsters - nuff' said for the casual person, like me. I was blown away by it. I loved it!<br /><br />Still, it has an anime-like acting vibe going on and at times presents itself with some value of humor. In some places, if I were picky, I'd point out where it lost its vibe.<br /><br />I ain't picky though, so I love it. Highly recommended. Won't spoil.
B0036EDVS0|5.0|Great movie one of the few Tim Burton's movies I liked.  Liked the humor in the movie.  A great movie from the late 90's.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great PA series.  Very well written and edited.  Characters are well developed and believable.<br /><br />Not sure what the title (Wool) stands for, but the story is about a society that has moved underground after a catastrophic event has made the topside atmosphere extremely toxic.<br /><br />This is a five book series and the storyline develops very slowly through the first couple of books as the author introduces us to his underground world (called a silo). The silo is designed to provide all the necessities of life and enough modern technology to keep the several thousand occupants plugged-in to a crude computer age.  Adults are employed in occupations which are essential to the silo.  Teenagers serve as apprentices. As long as everyone is doing their job and following the rules, the silo can sustain itself indefinitely.  As the generations go by, silo living becomes `normal' to the occupants.  That is until.......<br /><br />The author has envisioned a very unique, futuristic scenario.  As the story unfolds, you feel like you are actually right there with the silo dwellers.<br /><br />If you like the PA genre, you're gonna love this series.
B00FN811SY|5.0|At The Convention they said it would be released later for The kindle. So it will probably be a couple of days before its working for the Kindle Fire.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|a wonderful game. I had problems putting it down until the end.a good mix of puzzle and skill.hope to find more like it
B00425S1H8|5.0|This device was originally purchased for my MAC. I tried it with a Windows 7 and Windows 8 Machine and it works without external Drivers. PLUS, My windows 7 machine used to blue screen regularly until I used this one. I actually ordered then for every Notebook I have!!
B005KCGIUY|5.0|I love every song on this album. It opened my heart. There's nothing more to say. Buy it. Enjoy it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I can't wait to share this book with my daughter. This is a book that woman of all ages can enjoy.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|this product is okay..it does protect your kindle HD 7 inch tablet..i recommend this to everyone.i havent found any problem with mine.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is the best version/production of this Jane Austen classic.  Stellar performances from all.  Amanda Root is fabulous! Filming and direction are brilliant.
B0060ANOXY|5.0|By far this is Roger Water's best post-Pink Floyd record. You really do see how integral he was to the band's sound especially at the time of The Wall. This album has so many Pink Floyd signatures....does anybody notice the iconic piano \\"ping\\" from Echoes at the beginning of \\"What God Wants (Part III)\\" or the Dog barking from Animals on \\"Three Wishes\\" and of course the kids yelling on the playground at the beginning of \\"It's a Miracle\\"? It would have made a great PF record but alas we just need to settle for the fact that this is Roger Waters defining moment in his solo career. And, if we can't have David Gilmour we do get Jeff Beck who's pretty amazing on this album. Like all those great PF albums this one needs to be listened to in it's entirety. Roger Waters is well known as being a sour-puss and a major cynic but above all else he's a very intellegent man and he writes thinking-man's lyrics. And, even though a few of the tracks are slow I don't find this record to be a downer in any way...it's thought provoking and commands you to listen. This is a great record whether you are a Pink Floyd fan or not.
B003QCTGW2|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I have read it out loud several times to my elderly mother who has her own WWII experiences and am currently using it in an adult day care book club.
B00ERP55NQ|1.0|See the Google Earth+ review.  I was completely unable to make sense of<br />either app. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with both.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|I was really hoping to enjoy this more, but then I have to admit, I'd rather watch a good suspense or action flick than cartoons, any day. My husband is the animation fan, so I generally go along for the ride. There was one thing that struck me though, that I absolutely loved about this movie... although it really didn't have anything to do with the movie itself. The leading lady in this animated film wasn't drawn with the body of a barbie doll! She was much more realistic with an athletic body that bordered on being short and almost stocky. I'm sure the only reason they drew her that way was because she was a cave-girl, but since there weren't any non-cave girls in it, I liked it.
B00DYFCYSO|4.0|Rose Elena Marino<br /><br />My first John Legend CD, most enjoyable!<br />His love for his beautiful wife comes thru his music.<br />They are both fortunate to have found each other.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great and I love the game, it's so addictive and it should<br />be played more often and I especially love the Halloween version
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I would recommend this app.  I haven't been able to use all the features yet, but it is working good for me!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  Especially teenages and educators! Loved every second of it.  Great story of bravery, understanding and empathy.
B005GIS23I|4.0|Fun movie from the team of Simon Peg and Nick Frost.  A bit raunchy.  It was fun looking for all the scify references.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautifully written, had me laughing out loud and crying real tears.  It's one of those books that made me sad to finish.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is way better than the last one it is really cool and I recommend it to people who liked the last one
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best upstairs downstairs show since Godsford Park.  I suggest starting with season one.  You'll be immediately addicted and waiting for next season.
B00D1VKZ3M|4.0|Loved this book, I alternately cried and laughed all the way through it. There was enough depth, feeling and poignancy to make up for Bridget's completely manic behaviour. A fitting end to all the characters we have come to know and love.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product, family able to watch netflix right there cell phones and tables. Easy to install. Just follow simple direction. Use YouTube if you get in trouble
B004FRX0MY|1.0|It worked out of the US and Canada like itunes.  I don't understand why it doesn't.  With itunes I was able to buy music in the Costa Rica store with no problem at all.  Not sure why you guys don't go international.  If it has to do with piracy then you should know that anyone who wants to illegally download content can do it with ease and by not enabling your store on the international stage you are only hurting yourselves.  If you considered making purchases available in other countries you would be making alot more money in those markets than you are now (nothing).  Guess I'll stick to buying from Itunes.
B00362DRN6|1.0|Just echoing Scott Davies' review:<br /><br />If you plan on listening to this on decent gear in a quiet environment, don't buy it.  It is a victim of the loudness war (google it).  Terrible terrible remaster.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This makes me furious because I have anger problems. It so slow! I can't even START a video without it loading for a thousand hours! Don't get!
B008ELUEQC|4.0|love Rod Stewart music .there was nothing I didn't like about it. I have bought<br />many of his albums in the last few years.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So i got this since my computer is in my living room and my friends and I enjoy sharing youtube videos we find with each other. However i found out my 42&#34; HDTV (which is only 3 years old) is NOT HDCP compatible. I wont go into detail about the evil that is &#34;HDCP&#34; ill let you google/bing that and find out. but basicly most tv's made outside of 2010 are most likely not HDCP compatible which means this will not work. you will get a black screen, no sound, nothing.<br /><br />However lucky for me i have spare tv's in other bedrooms which ARE hdcp compliant; and this works fine on them. playing video on your computer/in your browser and 'casting' it to your tv however is laggy. skippy. jumpy. casting from your phone or mobile device is flawless and works just fine.<br /><br />if it wasnt for this new compliance bull crap this would be amazing on any tv; but make sure your tv is HDCP complaint first.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is a game really worth playing  great graphics and story too this is my second time and it,s just as good the second time
B00CMQX84A|5.0|This is a very good movie for tween children and they love the actors in it. I would definitely recommend
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is so much fun.  You have to think several moves ahead of the one you're on.  As you add suits the process is much more challenging.  This will keep you occupied and your mind active.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The most detailed and yet engaging historical book I've ever read.  Very long, but very worth the effort. First rate
B000002KHF|5.0|First time I heard Moondance I was driving my car and heard it on the radio.  I thought to myself, &#34;That is the coolest song I have ever heard.&#34;  I'm glad to own it now. The entire cd is great.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|vintage great.  Brought me back to my young teen years.  Did not realize then the sexual connotations that were through out the movie
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I really like the basic design of this pack. It is perfect for my needs - couple of camera bodies, lenses, filters and accessories. Very disappointed about the grab handle giving way a couple of hours into a 2-week trip. If they fix this issue with stitching then they'll have a perfect pack for someone who carries enough equipment to do the job.
B006TLZNDI|5.0|Big Fish was a great movie. Remembering our own grandpa's, it's easy to picture the dilemma of separating fact from fiction, as people tend to hyperbolize what they see as their own humdrum lives. The video and audio quality is good. However, I'd always suggest you reboot first, to clear junk software that slows the system, and use Microsoft Internet Explorer instead of Firefox, which tends to hang up. Clay Lifto (author of [[ASIN:1478710314 Only a Soldier Understands]])
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Loved this book and the 1st one too. This was well written, there were plenty of characters and plot twists and the plot is just amazing. You are an inspiring author and deserve praise! You really had me at the 1st sentence and there wasn't a dull moment. Well done!
B00571F26Y|5.0|A quite understandable presentation of a difficult to grasp topic (nutrition) for most.<br />Written with a touch of humor that makes it very readable.<br /><br />I would recommend it to all my friends.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is good but is on the fold out on my Kindle if you wait about 3 months without using it will go away but is supper handy.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|This is a great CD. Miley takes it to a new area. It's not a repeat CD either, you know the same old formula that works and singers keeps using it so all the CD's sound the same. Please listen to this CD a few times, it really grows on you
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The deviceworked fine for about three months after that it started giving all sort of issues like green screen, no sound, no chrome cast, the app for the music doesnt work neither. I know how this things work and it was not on my behalf. would never buy it again, now i have a piece of electronic junk.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read the author's preface and was surprised that it was really a made up children's story for his children. When I read it before there was a lot of comparison about different societies that each group represented. It was fun to read again and enjoyed it even more with that point of view.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just started playing this game and already I LOVE IT! It makes you stop and really think about how to solve the problem and move on to the next one. Finally, my kind of game. I love all kinds of puzzle and logic games. Thank you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Liked the way it was written.  The author actually makes you feel like you are one of the jurors.  Good story.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Couldn't put it down the story kept my interest till the very last page. The best of all 4 of Kate's books
B009LDD1X0|5.0|My husband and I love Big Ban Theory and have the first 6 seasons on DVD...the 6th is our favorite so far.  Hilarious!  We plowed through the whole season in three nights.  Loved it!
B002DKGWSE|5.0|i have the original \\"Last House on the Left\\" so i tried to watch this without comparing it to the original - over the yrs. i have watched the original 20 times atleast - always hanging on the edge of my seat - this remake is very very good - i think the only difference in the movies is the originals actors were really messed up people and alot more gorier - iam very glad i got the second one added to my collection
0694003611|5.0|I bought this for my nephew's second birthday.  My sister reports that he loves it and takes it to bed with him every night.  He refuses to go to bed without saying goodnight to the moon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I play it when I have a chanse and I love getting the bannanas, and my favorite is hitting the minion and its so funny.?
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This was a fairly straightforward thriller, one thrill and chase scene after another, that wasn't filled with gore and sex.  The first &#34;zombie&#34; film I've ever seen.<br /><br />I think Brad Pitt commented that this was the first movie he's made recently that his children can see. I'd still wait until they were 13 and over because the topic/views of killing and death, as well as the simple politics that flow in the film, are more suitable for teens and up.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Too bad it was cancelled after 1 season - rare that a sci fi or any show for that matter is great on it's first season.
0805047905|5.0|Great, classic little book. Perfect size for throwing in a diaper bag or keeping in the car. Love Eric Carle!
B00AKO93JK|4.0|This was alittle annoying at first but once you start to use it and click into the how to's it really is helpful in keeping you on track.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was written in a amazing way if has so much action and romance it has so much drama too
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it. It's a show on bps which I expected to be boring. But there are many twists and turns. Especially between the staff!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|they say to each this own but I don't get it, some people have too much time on their hands this is not my favorite but it looked interesting and you shouldn't knock it till you try it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The level of acting and intense storyline put this show on par with Breaking Bad. Two mangled thumbs up!!! Highly recommended.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|they say to each this own but I don't get it, some people have too much time on their hands this is not my favorite but it looked interesting and you shouldn't knock it till you try it.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|So happy for the &#34;life change&#34; in the main character at the beginning of the book.  Could not have handled it if she turned out to be a weeny the whole time.  It was fairly predictable for the reader, but I enjoyed the book and will read the next when it comes down in price.  Nice &#34;beach book&#34;.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn' wait to start the next book!! Then when that was done, the NEXT one!!! Its like twilight vs angels and demons but better!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|What is real and what is fiction. Is Teddy real? As far out as this story seems it could really happen and maybe it has happened.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|That's right, I have a girlfriend!<br />Also, this is a great game. Im not a fan of hidden object games, but this game is much more than that and even makes the hidden object parts fun and interesting, with an alternative dominoes mini game if you get stuck. The most fun we've had since The Room.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I am an avid reader of books about nutrition and health and firmly agree with Dr. Perlmutter and others  that diet and other lifestyle factors ultimately determine health and longevity.  Other books I've read recently  include Eating on the Wild Side by Jo Robinson and Eat to Live by Dr. Mark Fuhrman.<br /><br />In reading Dr. Perlmutter's dietary recommendations, I was struck by how different they were from Dr. Furhman's in how much animal products should be a part of diet.  Dr. Furhman's position is that no more than 10% of diet total should come from animal products and animal products should be consumed no more than several times per week.  In contrast, Dr. Perlmutter's view indicates that one should consume animal products daily with animal product categories to include poultry, red meat, eggs, fish and cheese.  Also, it seems Dr. Furhman recommends eating legumes and beans often, if not daily, while Dr. Perlmutter feels these food categories should be consumed more sparingly.  In Dr. Perlmutter's book, I did not see much discussion of phytonutrients and the role they play in the value of food that we consume.  Both physicians seem to agree to greens and vegetables should be emphasized in the diet.<br /><br />So, given that both these men are respected MDs writing about nutrition, why is there such a major disconnect in their core recommendations?  I for one am stumped about this point.  Also, I personally wonder if all wheat products are bad for consumption in moderation (excluding those with celiac disease) or just the products of modern, genetically modified wheat? What about Einkorn wheat, the heirloom type of wheat that has been around for a long time and is not genetically modified?  And are we to believe that their is no tradeoff in nutrition from  grain consumed in moderation? What about blue and red corn, the kind that hasn't been selectively bred to be sweet and therefore have a high glycemic index.<br /><br />Is anyone else out there confused on these points?
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|A terrific idea, and long overdue, but the execution was deeply flawed.  The movie is visually appealing but it falls especially flat when modern music is crowbarred into the party scenes.  Tobey Maguire spends the entire film with an earnest grin and Carey Mulligan really disappoints as one of the great female characters in American literary history. DiCaprio does well with the mysterious Gatsby, and it's painful to watch him unable to reconcile himself to Daisey's choice, but this isn't enough to save the film.  Read the book and use your imagination, it will be a lot better than the movie.
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|love action movies, Bruce Willis and Die Hard movies.<br />Holds your attention during the entire movie.<br />I recomended it to my family members
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had no prior knowledge about the orphan trains.  It was historically interesting but the human tales told in this book made it the fascinating read that it was.  It seems that lately nothing I have been reading was very satisfying but this book really hit all the high points for me.  I'm not going into detail (you can read many other reviews for that) but it was truly a feel-good book that I will reread to get more details from.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|We were watching episodes on regular TV and would see the same one several times, which we enjoyed. However, we had missed some/most of the beginning. We still laugh out loud at the situations that they find themselves. Great writing and terrific delivery.<br />This may not be for the young but it is fun for us!
B000FC1RCI|1.0|I'm a tradionalist with Agatha Chrisie so this book just didn't cut it with me. Way too dark and depressing . It was a struggle to get through it. Will be careful in the future before purchasing an off beat book of hers. Shocked it got so many high reviews.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|We are enjoying the writing and the cast's portrayal of their parts. The silly repetition of some of their actions keep us laughing.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Just liked the show, entertaining, quacky, sheriff save the day, good clean fun.try the show out, might grow on you.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the greatest books I have ever read. I Highly recommend to any one of all ages ! !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. My 8yr old daughter loves the game. It is challenging for her and she loves the challenge. I play it my self and like it also.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Used two on a long trip to the East Coast where power was only available at night for one week and by solar during photovoltaic cell during a week camping.  Kept mine and others iPhones charged and ready to go when needed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very good book! I suggest everyone to read it. Have a box of tissues by you... Fantastic book. Enjoy n
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Best season yet. Walter and Jesse really transform this season. I can't get over how well-acted this show is. I love the character of Gustavo's and this season you get more information on his backstory.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Might have been fun to make but movie was boring and low caliber for this actor.  Guess I'll have to check more reviews and not assume anymore that just because Brad's in it, it'll be any good.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Too many times I have had bingos that were not credited to me, even though the game was ongoing and there bingos remaining.  Noted especially on shadow cards.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I love the Iron Man movies and this one did not let me down one bit. It's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Great finish to a fun trilogy.  I really like everything Sanderson writes. His magic systems are always fresh.  I look forward to his next work. Which should not take long as he is so prolific compared to some other fantasy authors.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good  MYSTERY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,  VERY GOOD ENDING. DOES THIS LEAVE AN OPENING FOR A NEXT BOOK? some what of a different structure in the book.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I've loved this show from Day 1.  I still remember rushing to the tv the night it premiered when I was a kid.  It brings back a lot of memories of growing up in the 90s.  I fully recommend.  I hope amazon will get more seasons to stream.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|The best book I have read in ages!  Gripping and intelligent.<br />Hope Terry continues to churn them out!  Well done!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Was at first hesitant to pick this up as the fourth book was somewhat lackluster and other reviews panned this one for not moving the story forward; but i ended up enjoying it. Introduced many new interesting characters and i look forward to book 6.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|A interesting puzzle game. I find it more frustrating than challenging. It has a quirky style and bold color. one
B000HSKUBE|5.0|This is an excelllent series that offers great entertainment.  I highly recommend this series to all who are like subtle humor.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Really enjoyed this film when it first came out. All performances were excellent! Keaton is really terrific here! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice!
B004RL9T50|4.0|Bad guy can be good. Ketamine hit the point that you can change and be good even with adversity. It has great parts and teach a great lesson . It has a part everyone.
B002N57KG2|5.0|Very funny movie! Dom and Burt along with everyone else make this a very good film. Great cars and some very nice ladies too! Lots of fun, fun, fun!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show. Very well written. Good long format so the details at not rushed.  Can't wait for season three. Clever
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|A timeless hit.  Saw the movie numerous times.  Liza, like her Mom, was a star whose brilliance never fades.  Bravo
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|There is nothing I do not love about this movie. It has been in my top five for several years. It is a beautiful unique love story with so much more.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|The ultimate Joni Mitchell in a series of albums that I'll enjoy for as long as I can hear :-)
B00007KWHG|5.0|Fabulous.  I purchased this CD because I met one of the original band members and got his autograph when they were in concert at the Coliseum in Madison, Wisconsin in the 1970s.  I also went to New York to see the Jersey Boys, which was awesome.
B00E3D7WGU|4.0|Experiencing MADONNA live is always an amazing spectical for the senses. She is on-of-a-kind performer. There is no equal. This could only be better if her source material, her MDNA album, was better. Her MDNA release was one of her weakest. I NEVER expect a greatest hits tour when I see her but this was no Sticky and Sweet Tour which blew my socks off.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|This watch looks nice (I didn't think the band was too small at all) but it really does run too fast like other reviews mention.  Over one minute a day when wearing the watch all day.  Worse though is that if you don't wear the watch all day, it quickly loses its charge and will go dead.  I've had a Seiko Kinetic for over 10 years and that held a charge for weeks!  Of course a Kinetic is more expensive, but I expected this watch to hold a charge for more than 10 hours after wearing it for 8+ hours.  And yes, I fully charged this watch by wearing it all day.  The poor accuracy plus inability to hold a charge for even half a day killed this watch for me.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Clearly, I am a fan of this author. I bought this book on its opening day. Not too many of us remember 1927 from envolvement but it was quite a remarkable year in our country's history.<br />I found it a fascinating read.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|This was a great family movie ...my kids really enjoyed it ages 11 and 8... We give it Four Stars
0375869026|5.0|A book that's hard to put down. Creatively written. My wife wants to order several as Christmas gifts for her reading friends.<br />It is a joy to own and share with others.
B00DIQWQUU|4.0|It took me a while to warm up to Oneotrix Point Never (I still have trouble spelling / pronouncing the name), I've enjoyed some of his prior releases but always felt him to be kind of overrated.  R Plus Seven, for me, is the first OPN album that I immediately enjoyed without the need for repeat listens. It bursts with color and playful energy, the compositions resist the urge to build themselves into traditional song structures but get far enough to where you are left with an impression of a song and know what it could be. Many of the tracks seem thwarted by a deficient chromosome somewhere during their evolution.  The elements are all there, the rhythm, the melodies, the machinery we are so familiar with but instead we are given music that we immediately connect with but are fairly certain we've never experienced before.<br /><br />R plus seven is fun to listen to, and feels like you're watching a storm of pink marshmallows.  It's surprising in its twists and turns, its playfulness and recontextualization of sounds we thought we knew.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I will definitely buy this book. I am very curious to see how it progresses from here.  Looks like a good read.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Neat device which allows cord cutters to access even more television programming without cable. Easy set up and works well...the nice thing is that it doesn't appear to &#34;tattle&#34; on you by letting services like Hulu know that you are viewing content on your television rather than your computer.

B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Blu-Ray does not default to English as a language so you have to choose it.  Also it defaults to 2.0 audio instead of 5.1 or 7.1.  So you have to go back to the menu screen and choose your audio in the settings.  And if you stop the blu-ray and come back to it.  You get to jump through all those hoops all over again.  Absolutely the most amateur blu-ray I have come across.  Who programmed this??
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I bought this First Series to catch up with the story line because only Season Two was being shown on TV at the time.  I love Movies about Zombies and End of the World Scenarios, not that I would ever wish for that reality though.  Zombies Movies have been my favorite Movies ever since the original Dawn of the Dead came out in theaters in 1978.  I like The Walking Dead Series because the movie shows respect for the dead - they are treated like they are real and it is actually happening that the dead are walking the Earth.  I also like the fact that the dead are not thinking or running like living people; movies that do have the dead seeming to start thinking or having them running ruin the experience of having a world where the dead walk amongst us.  All movies that deal with the dead coming back should take notes and emulate The Walking Dead.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Very fast paced thriller!  Well worth watching!  Brad Pitt does an excellent job!  Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time!
B00594XOZU|5.0|For those of you who are logging out and it doesn't work when you want to open it next, just stay logged on it works and its easier that way. Everything is good but like the led colour and sending vids or watching videos that are sent is only supported for the phone. It's seems unfair to me. But other than that it's good. But you might want to update it.<br /><br />I NEVER WROTE THIS REVIEW. CONTACTING AMAZON!

B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Miley Cyrus' `Bangerz': The Heartfelt Ballads<br />Miley's attitude,  sexiness and emotion all come out in full force on Bangerz. If you're one of the few people who haven't streamed it yet, we're here to give you a run down of the things you need to know.<br /><br />The album starts with \\"Adore You,\\" a ballad that immediately showcases Miley's amazing voice and range. It's heartfelt, and seems to be completely about Liam, as does \\"Drive.\\" The lyrics for both are about a love so strong and painful -- which we know Miley has experience with.<br /><br />One of Miley's collaborations if with Future for \\"My Darlin',\\" which features a remix of \\"Stand By Me.\\" At a first listen, it seems off and boring. But listening again, it's actually genius in a way -- the slow ballad is emotional and their chemistry comes through through the beautiful harmony. I'm loving here Miley's softer side in her voice.<br /><br />Both \\"Maybe You're Right\\" and \\"Someone Else\\" are full of intense and real emotion from Miley -- \\"you can blame me for who I am . . . You might think I'm crazy, that I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind. Maybe you're right\\" -- it's 100 percent about Liam, as she even says \\"this chapter's done.\\" It's so nice to hear Miley's strong, emotional side come through -- just like it did in \\"Wrecking Ball.\\"<br /><br />`Bangerz' Is Full Of Bangin' Dance Songs<br />Miley worked with Big Sean in one of the most ridiculous and equally fun hits on the album is \\"Love, Money, Party.\\" Regardless if you're sitting in your room listening, you're dancing. It's impossible not to! Miley's rapping is a little absurd, but totally entertaining.<br /><br />My favorite hit on the album is #GETITRIGHT -- because even though the lyrics couldn't be more raunchy, the beat and the whistling is so catchy. I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't make it on the radio, but in a way, it sounds like old, innocent Miley, but the lyrics . . . well, let's just say they fit the naked Miley more than Hannah.<br/><br />\\"FU,\\" features French Montana and for some reason, I forget how much I adore until I play it again. It contains a huge amount of abbreviations, but for some reason works. It really makes me rock out no matter where I am. Sure, the lyrics are a little lame -- \\"I've got two letters for you, one is `f' and the other one's `u'\\" -- but it has a Amy Winehouse-feel to it, showing her huge range and ability to make her music slide. It's a great mix of ballad with real jam.
B008NC1LJ6|1.0|Watched the whole thing waiting for some wild twist in the end. Never happened. 2 hours of my life I can't get back.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is a beautiful piece of art.<br />Yet, the production is horrible, but don't listen to me, buy the album off hdtracks.com and see how amazing the difference in mastering is!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It's worth the download time.<br /><br />Still buy the album, as it is great to have the awesome packaging (get the digi-pack).

B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is one great DVD and season 5 was the best so far.  Great picture quality and it arrived on schedule.  There are also several good extras, such as omitted scenes, interviews, etc.  Well worth the purchase, especially if one is a Castle fan.
0071752854|3.0|I wouldn't buy this book in retrospect.  It feels like an attempt to write \\"the game\\" by neil strauss for raising money. It's a valiant attempt, but glosses over details and focusing on building a great business is infinitely better than playing power games.  Or, if you're going to play power games, play after reading 48 Laws of Power and The Art of Persuasion.<br /><br />--previous write-up--<br />Sales strategies are often discounted by Oren, which makes me want to put this book down immediately. In my opinion, this is naive and clearly derived from a person with admittedly no sales experience.  Building rapport is all about learning about other people's frames, then using a lot of the psychological tools he describes in his book.  It's about reframing a conversation, but such is only possible after understanding the person you're pitching's mindset.  I'm going to finish this book, because it has nuggets of truth... but, it's important for people to read some sales books as follow-ups.<br /><br />Oren's counter measures and defined efforts to maintain a psychological balance at the negotiation and pitch table are very valuable.  I've definitely experienced the need to deliver a particular image and the power of doing so.  Being able to shift one frame to the next is powerful, and I look forward to employing some of these techniques and seeing how they work.  All-in-all, a decent read.<br /><br />The key to sales is remembering why people buy. Oren mentions that money is a tool for investors.  This is clearly true.  It's a tool to derive value, and there are real constraints investors deal with.  Learning these constraints, motivations, and desires has been most valuable for me in talking with investors.  I'd spent a combination of efforts learning those, practicing and reading some books like this to get your psychological state in the right place.  Here's my list of investment books in case you're curious: http://www.amazon.com/gp/wishlist/S4HVK1MNBNGD<br /><br />Feel free to ask any f/u questions.>Feel free to ask any f/u questions.

B00000JG41|5.0|This record is almost beyond description. if it came out this year, I'd say it's WAY ahead of it's time. The fact that it came out in 1999 is just astonishing. This is an amazing album in many ways. The musicianship is off the hook...the writing is a combination of progressive, underground, creepy, happy, expansive, funny, sad, angry...etc.....<br />the production value is top notch, even by today's standards.....<br /><br />This album is so amazing that I can't even imagine how they'd pull it off in a 'live' setting. But then, Queen did alright 'live' didn't they?<br />get this album!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The story picks up seamlessly from The Shining.  Though it has been years, the way the storyline is written takes you back and helps you remember and segues nicely.  Interesting premise and cleverly written with building suspense, leading up to the climax and aftermath.  Look forward to the next King novel.
B000E97X66|5.0|For me this album scores on two points, I love 'live' albums and I am a big fan of Bruce Springsteen - double whammy! This particular album has only recently (last few years) been officially released, but was available before from time to time as a bootleg, so its content is well documented. As a snapshot in time of a historic performance it is obviously significant, let me say however that it is an excellent recording of a really tight bunch of musicians really enjoying themselves.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed any of the bands other live performances such as 'Live - 1975 - 1985' or 'Live in New York City' you will not be disappointed here. An excellent performance, one of my favorite choices for long journeys where you can enjoy the whole thing uninterrupted.<br /><br />Stand out points? I guess I never tire of the opening track 'Thunder Road' but 'Rosalita' is a rip roaring breathless awesome performance tempered throughout by Clarence Clemons awesome sax, while his solo in 'Jungleland' shouldn't be missed either.<br /><br />Pros - 16 brilliant songs<br />Cons - none<br /><br />If I was offered a chance to go back in time to watch any legendary performance, this would be my choice! If I was being castaway on a desert island? Then stuff the books give me an MP3 player with this on it. Its that good, so if you like Bruce and the Band buy this - you need it, if you're not sure, try it anyway you'll likely be converted!

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|It was good to see further development of Spock, but Khan was a little dissapointing.

B004RJMUJO|3.0|My 3 year old grandson has a fun time chopping all the fruits up and does pretty well.<br />It is a simple game for younger children.

The kids just have to learn to avoid the \\"bombs\\" that fly out every once<br />in awhile because they explode and the game is over.<br /><br />However my older grandchildren (ages 6yrs up) get completely bored.<br /><br />So I would recommend ages at the youngest 2 1/2years old to<br />maybe 4 1/2 years old.. possibly 5years old at best.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I'm a newcomer to the TV show, &#34;Castle.&#34; I discovered it just two months ago, and now I'm all caught up with my wife and I having had &#34;Castle&#34; marathons for a couple of weeks in a row. If you'll simply buy the premise that a mystery writer who happens to be friends with the mayor gets to &#34;ride along&#34; with a senior Detective Beckett and help her solve crimes, then you're in for an enjoyable treat. The writers (plural) of the TV show also give us two other detectives, plus Castle's actress mother and extremely smart and adorable daughter, all of whom are tremendously likeable, often funny, and who interact as though they like/love each other. It becomes utterly believable and each episode is wrapped around a murder or three.<br /><br />I just happened to be looking for a new mystery to read, and found &#34;Richard Castle&#34; and the character-becomes-author twist. While the TV show at times becomes a little convoluted, I honestly felt that if the author of the book had added one more character, I was going to need an organization chart, and me without a DVR to rewind. A gossip columnist is murdered, and off we go...on an fairly enjoyable read (3 ½ stars actually).<br /><br />However, the characters are not as likeable - as fleshed out if you will - or as funny. The two &#34;minor&#34; detectives have even lesser roles, and the coroner who on the TV show can crack you up with a look, is along with the daughter and mother, nonexistent. The give-and-take between Castle (or Rook as the case may be) and Beckett (Heat) is flat, and there are few references to the reader's day-to-day real lives that makes you smirk, smile, or just laugh when you hear them on the show.<br /><br />If there were no TV show, I probably would still give it 4 stars, not 5. Five stars to the show (until the first three of this season) which has the advantage of having excellent actors who make it seem as though they probably like each other off-camera, and without seeing of having facial expressions described, the book is simply lacking.<br /><br />It's doubtful that I will spend that much to read another &#34;Nikki Heat&#34;/Richard Castle book. If you enjoy the TV show, this may be a disappointment. If you've never seen the show, this may be a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />ewf having facial expressions described, the book is simply lacking.<br /><br />It's doubtful that I will spend that much to read another &#34;Nikki Heat&#34;/Richard Castle book.

B00502ATUO|5.0|This is early British pop/ mod music played by the great Brian Auger on his B-3 organ. On vocals is Julie Driscoll. For me, this music is great to have on cd after wearing out Lp. This is good early jazz/ pop. Hard to explain, go to Amazons site to listen to samples from either Brian Auger or Julie Driscoll. Auger later became one of my favorite fusion bands, as we went on to form Brian Auger's Oblivion Express. That music is incredible for me- Freedom Jazz Dance & so much more he went on to record. He still plays today adding his talents to other bands or his own with son on drums & his dtr on vocals. This is his early roots & it may sound dated to some, but for me it was worth getting- thank you for reading this small review
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|I purchased this product when I got the new iPhone 5s. I have to say, it works great! It also look great! The one down side is, it is destructible. Unlike, many otter cases that protect the phone completely, this product is more for show. My small Shih Tzu got ahold of it and the back is now covered in teeth marks. Thankfully, nothing happened to my phone. I would recommend this product to a friend.<br /><br />Like I said: its not going to protect your phone completely. So, this product is more good for adults who aren't going to be dropping their phone every five minutes. Teenagers: buy an otter box.
