B009AMANBA|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this historical Lincoln movie during the Civil War era. The actors portrayed their characters in a way that brought them to \\"life\\".  It is not about all the fighting that occurred during this period, but it provided us with the great emotions up and down that must have taken place  during Lincoln's time.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Excellent movie if you love a scary movie. although i will say i hated the end! Almost sad. a heartwarmmng momment
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Very good competitive game. Lots of friends love to play the weekly tournaments. Would recommend it to anyone. lots of fun
0446576220|2.0|I think the title is misleading. I would say half of the book is good. Second half is all about Zappos and their culture. It speaks more about all the cool/great things they do.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was a great movie. I can't wait to see the 2nd one. I hope they include more Marvel heros. I also hope that RDJ doesn't quit the role of Tony Stark, RDJ is the pivotal Iron Man/Tony Stark. It will take a long time before anyone else can have that role.
B000065PUE|5.0|I've respected the Pixies for several years, but never took the time to get into them. I would say this is a must-have for any music fan, and a good album to buy if you're looking to hear more than the few songs that you've already heard.
030758836X|1.0|This was selected by my book discussion group.  I would never have finished it, except for that obligation.  I felt slimy when I had finished it. Ugh! It is ugly and badly written. What is more, the characters are not in the least interesting. How dreadful that the novel should have deteriorated so badly. Jacqueline Susan did a better job than this Ms. Flynn. This is the worst book I have read in YEARS. I'm sorry I bought it on Kindle and won't have the satisfaction of throwing it in the trash. I'm a Psych professional - the science is bad -- sloppy -- ; the lawyer in my group pointed out that the legal & police procedural material is bad.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this very much. looking forward to the sequel.  I found everything to be in good form. It took me longer then most games of this type.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book ties up most of the loose ends in a series that lasted way too long. That's about all I can say for it.  I wish I'd just waited for it to be available at the library. Not worth the money.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very good and fun game. I highly recommended this game but I must warn you it is very addictive. Takes some strategy though.
0743243153|4.0|Still good.  Some of the best advice I ever read was the first line:  &#34;Life is difficult.&#34;  That was a wake up call the first time I read it and it continues to be true.

B000QCS8TW|3.0|I really wanted to like these books, hoping that they might be a bit different than the total darkness of the TV show.  I was wrong.  I do not like these books, and am really coming to despise this author as well.  If you are looking for Lord of the Rings or R A Salvatore, you will not find them here.  I give this book three stars because obviously Martin has a lot of talent and is a master of the descriptive passage.  I continue to read because I want to find out what happens next, he has hooked me that well, but then curse myself for a fool when I get to the next section.  His world is one in which winters and summers last for multiple years.  It is also a world where all intelligence and integrity was lost with the death of the last dragons.  There are two types of characters in the book.  Those who are completely despicable and self serving, willing to burn their own house down with their family inside to gain a momentary advantage.  And those who are loyal, brave and totally devoid of any intelligence.  One reviewer stated that he liked the book because you couldn't tell who was going to die.  I disagree.  I found any character that was sympathetic in any way was destined to eventually die a brutal and horrible death.  If I wanted to read this kind of story I would pick up a history of England, or of the French-English wars.  The world is governed by a complete ast system in which all of the nobles are decptive bastards with not one shred of intelligence.  I will finish this series, but don't think I will pick up any more of Martin's work.  Even Elric of Melnibone had more life than Game of Thrones.  The best ending to the series would be for the comet in the sky to strike the planet and wipe everyone out.  That would be a more hopeful world than exists in these pages.

193700788X|1.0|*Spoilers*  Wow, what can I say? Being such a huge fan of the books I was so excited for this book to come out. I've spent the last seven years reading these books anxiously awaiting the next addition. I read this book in one day not because of how good it was, but because I knew it really couldn't be ending the way it was playing out. Everything about this books was wrong. The characters were not themselves at all, the sudden use of 3rd POV in this book was very odd, and the story itself just seemed thrown together like Ms. Harris was tired of writing these books and wanted the readers to feel the same pain of reading the book as she felt writing it. I admit I'm an Eric lover, but I knew all along that Eric and Sookie would not get their HEA, Sookie made it clear several times in the previous books that she did not want to become a Vampire, so really, how long would they really last ? I always thought she would probably end up with Sam, because Ms. Harris obviously has a hard on for ginger barkeeps, but no biggie Sam's a good guy, but jeez give let them have a build up, let her mourn Eric, her love of the last 9 books. I hope to wake up in the morning and find this is all a very bad dream, and my copy of this book is lying on my table unread, ready for me to discover the true ending to the Sookie saga.<br />Disappointed

0141195851|4.0|Penguins are always good value for the money.  Many if not all of these stories are available online for free, but it is convenient to have a paper copy with good editing that is not intrusive.<br /><br />If you have never read \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" you will find that it's somewhat different from the film versions, especially because the narrator adds an interesting voice to the narrative.<br /><br />Dickens wrote many other Christmas stories, and some of those included are almost as good as the \\"Carol\\" but very different.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I obviously can't speak to the quality of the DVD or Bluray transfers, as the product is yet to be released. I can only say that the film was amazing. I saw it twice in IMAX 3D. I enjoyed it even more the second time, as I got over my worries about wether or not it would measure up to the 2009 reboot (ultimately it does) and just enjoyed it as a fun ride. The film has some nice twists and turns, nods to the original series and some expansion on themes touched upon in the first movie. If you only saw it once, the DVD would be a great way to sit back and enjoy it again.

193700788X|4.0|<Spoilers-------------------Don't read if you haven't read the book-----------------------------><br /><br />I must admit, I expected Sookie to die in the end.<br /><br />All the signs were there, she's just a person with too many people hunting for her.  Her only ending would have been death and rebirth as a vampire in my mind.  As a Vampire, she would face her enemies on a completely different playing ground.  When she died I wanted her to see Gran and have a heart to heart.<br /><br />In this case not so much.  In the wings I've always rooted for Sookie to end up with Sam.  There have been nice moments between them and I hoped it would slowly turn into something.  This was not quite what I expected.  I wanted a slow realization that Sam was the one for her after the last book.  An epiphany that she used the Cluviel Dor for Sam because she loved Sam.  I wanted her to realize that she had to end it with Eric and then I wanted to see Eric try to keep her.  What we got was Sookie in many ways seeming to \\"settle\\" for Sam because he was less drama filled.  The love scene seemed rushed and perfunctory. I was glad for this union but disappointed in how it came about.<br /><br />Halfway through this book I was reminded of the last episode of Seinfeld when all these people came back for the trial and Pow!  Here it was again.  But we missed the really \\"Aw\\" moment by not letting them say anything or show outrage on her behalf.<br /><br />There were lots of moments where I was like, \\"Wow, that's a missed opportunity!\\"<br /><br />So why 4 stars?<br /><br />Because this is a series and with a series you begin to take ownership of the characters and have a pre-determined view of how they will behave and what will happen to them.  At the end of it, I enjoyed the fast paced reading of the story and the plot twists and red herrings.  I was disappointed in the way Eric behaved but Sookie's behavior fit her.  This is a woman who has not had many relationships and frankly is relationship-impaired.  We saw that with Quinn.  She's passive-aggressive and a hothead.  It makes sense that she'd check out on Eric and pretend he didn't mean that much to her.<br /><br />Continuity wise, she could read Alcide and Sam's thoughts so I don't know why this changed?  That was annoying but whatever.<br /><br />All and all I devoured this book and enjoyed the outcome.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, the first and only novel of Harper Lee, is a book that we have all read at some point during our education. For some of us, such as myself, we've read it more than once. With 3 years in between visits with Scout, Atticus, and Tom Robinson, I understood a lot more when I met them the second time. At the awkward stage-rich age of twelve and seventh grade, I still didn't really understand what rape was, and why it was such a huge deal that Mayella was white and Tom was black. But now, with new historical and social knowledge, I understand that blacks and whites just didn't date or even really communicate  with each other for that matter. The 1920 American South's society just didn't accept that.<br /> Reading this book again now, and watching a film on the author has lead me to believe that Harper Lee, the author of To Kill A Mockingbird, and the daughter of a lawyer in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, gently based this book off her own experiences. It is a commonly known fact that Dill is based off her childhood friend turned famous author, Truman Capote. It is supposed, although not confirmed, that Scout is actually Harper Lee. Lee no longer grants interviews, and is almost like Boo Radley, the mysterious shut in that lives down the street from the Finch family.<br /> In To Kill A Mockingbird, Atticus is given the difficult task of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, in court. Robinson was accused of raping a white trash woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus, described as a man who was born to \\"do our unpleasant jobs,\\" does everything he can to defend Tom, but still loses because of the biased, racist jury. Although he could have won the appeal, he never got the chance, and Tom was murdered. Innocent, young-minded me didn't understand why anyone would just dislike someone or choose them to be guilty of a crime they didn't commit. To be quite honest, seventh grade me just thought I was smarter than the jury. In a sense, I was like Scout, the unbiased narrator.<br /> In the end, although remaining innocent, Scout has done a fair amount of growing up. She endures much teasing in school, is forced to become a \\"lady\\" by her Aunt Alexandra, is impacted by two deaths one after another, and is even almost murdered herself. When I was a child of her age, the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me was when I escaped from preschool and crossed Buford Road, while holding my dear friend Ben hostage... Which is still fairly exciting for a three year old, but it was completely incomparable to Scout. I can understand why Scout had the maturity of a teenage at the age of 8 or 9, and I praise Harper Lee for this. With the amount of hardships Scout had been through... It really causes a child to grow up faster. When I read that Phoebe Lou Adams had written, \\"It is impossible, being told in first person by a six year old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult.\\" I definitely have to disagree on this one. Scout is a very mature young girl, with more horrific experiences than the average adult. She also, as an adult, is recalling the events of her childhood. So obviously an adult would have the prose style of an adult. Duh. Even her first grade teacher, a beautiful, bitter, rule stickler of a young woman, scolds Scout for being educated.<br /> Reading To Kill a Mockingbird again as a 15 year old has really helped me understand Harper Lee's award-winning novel much more. This book, which as sold over 30 million copies in the fifty years it has been in print, is a novel that will influence the lives of readers for many generations to come. I hope my children have the chance to read it more than once in their school career just as I did; once in middle school, and once in high school, just so they can extract all of the valuable life lessons from it at each stage in their development.

She shows him how willing to be loving and supporting and just plain good she is... He eventually becomes a better person for it... Daddy has to be a good man who simply needs to see that he's not giving Johnny the chance he deserves... great Catskills resort setting, 1963... as seen from the 80's, when we have forgotten that a black couple would not be allowed to dance like that together with white folks in the early 60s.<br />Patrick Swayze made the part of Johnny better than it was written. Jennifer Gray is quite a dancer, something I hadn't realized when I saw her in Red Dawn (Patrick Swayze was in that one, too). I love Jerry Ohrbach, and, like Swayze, he made his character better than the writing did. Kelly Bishop was definitely underutilized, they had a wonderful actress (and professional dancer) and gave her nothing to do...<br />Well, you shouldn't probably be sharing it with your 12 year old, but its very good and a little campy and I didn't waste my time watching it...

B00CL0J99K|5.0|Warning: here be spoilers.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 sets out to return Iron Man to his roots of dark, believable action established in the first movie, while retaining the big-spectacle adventure of Avengers. To that end we see Tony Stark face off against a peculiar new representation of the Mandarin, a snarling, ethnically nebulous terrorist ringleader portrayed by Ben Kingsly. After an exasperated Stark promises to end the Mandarin's reign of terror, the mastermind seemingly orders the destruction of Stark's house, setting him on a quest to locate the Mandarin through an entertaining combination of detective work and MacGuyver-esque trickery. Stark is opposed by an army of mysterious flunkies who have been granted superpowers by Extremis, a genetic modification originally meant to help the disabled (as opposed to military nanites as in the comic).<br /><br />Viewers have made much of this film's twist- that the Mandarin is in fact a puppet of the real villain, AIM director Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who has hired a degenerate English actor to portray a power-mad despot as part of a political misdirection. This was a polarizing twist- for those who are new to the franchise it is a clever, Shyamalan-esque turn, and for serious comic nerds, it's an unexpected twist that is not out of line with the spirit of the franchise. For many, however, the reveal that the Mandarin was not in fact his usual Ming-the-Merciless-esque self, or even real, was a huge disappointment. For me the twist worked- I was disappointed at how generic and ridiculously grimdark the Mandarin initially appeared, but the reveal that he was a fiction- and not a very bad guy in reality- was something I did not expect. One can also read the twist as something of a satire of Ben Kingsly's career, which has been heavily built on playing ethnic and foreign characters, just as his filmic alter-ego does.<br /><br />Another point of contention is that Iron Man spends so much of the film outside his armor. Iwould assert that this is important- by pitting the largely average Tony Stark against the super-powered AIM operatives who obstruct him we see him acting as a hero without the crutch of dominating technology. It makes for a refreshing reminder that under the armor there is still a hero we can root for.<br /><br />Although it's not as BIG of a movie as Avengers, Iron Man 3 succeeds at being a thriller, and action film, and just a bit funny all at once. It rekindles the new, fresh feel of the first movie in a way that the second missed, and develops all of its characters in entertaining, satisfying directions. Of particular note is Ty Simpkins as Harley, a bratty sidekick who attaches himself limpet-like to the unwilling Tony. I am always leery of kids in movies of this kind, but he's spot on. It's also hard to fault Shane Black, who blends 90s directorial sensibilities with modern FX and camerawork to create a movie that feels different from its predecessors and from the rest of the MCU. Among other things, Black dials back on the CG of Avengers with numerous effective practical effects (I could swear I spotted a cable when Iron Man rescues the crew of Air Force 1, though) and excellent set design and lighting throughout.<br /><br />Were I to complain about any part of the film, it would be the character of Tony's friend James Rhodes, AKA War Machine (Don Cheadle once again). Back when he was Terrance Howard, Rhody didn't even GET to be War machine, and he was only limited in the second film. Here once again the producers seem concerned that audiences will be confused by the presence of two Iron men, as War Machine spends most of his time out-of-scene, and participates in the climax out of his armor. I love Cheadle's take on the character, and would have loved to see him get a better part as what we DO see is well in line with the character as he appears in other media.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Unique direction makes for a film that feels genuinely different from theother coming attractions<br />-Good acting from a pretty diverse cast of characters<br />-Recaptures the feel of the first Iron Man<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Editing is sloppy in some places<br />-Soundtrack is not particularly memorable<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br />Iron Man 3 is a worthwhile entry in MCU canon, and its departures from the comics are justifiable as part of building the film.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The story line is so hard to believe it verges comical. Very poor writing and, as it has been said before, the characters seem to be from the mind of a teenager.
B002GHIPYI|2.0|I did a lot of research to find a good pair of headphones at a reasonable price. Many good reviews directed me to the Superlux lineup. This particular model was the cheapest, so I gave it a shot. Surprisingly, the amount of detail that these headphones produce is incredible for the price. Instrument separation is equally impressive. You can hear absolutely everything in your music. The bass extension is it's greatest strength due to the huge drivers that act like mini-sub-woofers. They are extremely sturdy too. In addition, these headphones work really well without amplification.<br /><br />BUT, they are extremely uncomfortable as the headband is tight and clamps my head. Twisting and bending the headband solves the problem. However, the p leather ear-pads make my ears sweat and seem too small to fully surround my ear. I feel an irritating sensation on my earlobes. This discomfort is noticeable after only 20 minutes. Moreover, the upper-mid frequencies (around 7 kHz I heard) are obnoxiously boosted. As a result, poor recordings with screeching noises (You typically find them on live recordings) cause me pain. Lowering the volume can tame the harsh sounds. However violins, pianos, bells, trumpets, xylophones etc... sound harsh, artificial and sibilant. Some female vocals can sound weird too. As a result, ambient music, classical, jazz, rock, electronica and folk (IE 99% of my music collection) is un-listenable because of the sibilant sounds. In addition, I think that these headphones sound a little cold and lack musicality compared to my Grado sr60. I guess that it's due to the \\"Monitoring\\" purpose of this specific model.<br /><br />Overall, I think that I would absolutely love these headphones if only the upper-mids weren't so harsh and the comfort was better. I would recommend spending more money and getting a pair of Sennheisers, Grados, Audio Technicas or AKGs for a 100$ or more.
B004I4M0A2|2.0|Ikea the corporation had nothing to do with the release of this app; hence the odd alterations to the Ikea logo and the awkward disclaimer before you initiate the app.  Clunky, incredibly slow, and generally useless, I'm surprised Ikea hasn't sued to get this poor excuse for an app that doesn't reflect well on their company removed from the app store. Good reviews are obviously fake plants.  Delete!
B009X00E18|3.0|Thought it was easier to hold my Kindle laying in bed but is awkward and the folding mechanism comes out of its stand up position  to many times, tired of holding it in place.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|Erin O'Brien makes it a really fun workout!  She's funny and sensitive to pregnancy limitations because she's very pregnant too.  The couple's workout looks like a lot of fun, and a little romantic too :)  I'm early in my second trimester, I'm waiting till I'm a little bigger to invite my husband in for the couple's workout, he doesn't have to do anything except for be my support.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I have this website on my desktop and was thrilled that I can have it on my Kindle, also. The variety of music that is available is incrediblble
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't remember when was the last time I enjoyed any book so much. I laughed, I was entertained, I swooned. Tangled, book with witty and sarcastic hero as narrator, is a MUST READ! This insight into man's head and thinking is fascinating and a lot of fun.<br /><br />SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:<br />Drew Evans used to be always on the top of things, getting everything he wanted and enjoying life of a single good-looking bachelor. Until he got flu which changed him into whinning man, lying down on his couch and watching stupid movies for a whole week. Or was in not the flu that brought this strong man into this pathetic state?<br /><br />After short prologue, story is set four months earlier to the times when Drew is successful gentleman who is enjoying services of various willing ladies every time opportunity arises. Yep, he is a man-whore. Also, Drew is extra confident person so when he meets woman he wants and cannot get, he is not willing to accept it. But what happens when proffesional competion and love gets into his way and complicates things? You get this superb and original romance story.<br /><br />I loved \\"the voice\\" and style of writing in this book. It was magical, sarcastic, witty and funny. Perfection if you like to read something entertaining with well-thought storyline developement and sexy hero. I just completely adored Drew's inner thoughts and they were pretty hilarious too. I have never read about cockier hero than Drew Evans. But you will fall for him anyway, he is just that awesome. I personally will never forget him.<br /><br />Kate was also awesome character. She was able to keep up with Drew all the time, matched his determination, even outsmarted him quite often. She was smart, gorgeous and ambitious. Dangerous combination when it comes to woman, right?<br /><br />And story itself? It was flawless. There were moments that made me laugh, moments that left me all hot and bothered, as well as angsty or lovely moments. To be honest, I could not find single thing that I would not like about this book.<br /><br />I hope this author will write more books in future. I will be reading it as soon as they come out. After reading Tangled, I am definitely her fan.ingle thing that I would not like about this book.<br /><br />I hope this author will write more books in future.

B008JFLWLE|5.0|I love this app.  Its not meant to replace your TI-89, however, but for basic to intermediate calculations, its perfect.
B0040I09RM|4.0|It keeps me interested and guessing for what is coming up next. The characters are very attractive. Funny sexy and witty
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|A lot of my favorite shows are over, but this brought me to a better place. This show has gotten so much better than i ever thought. I cant wait for the next season.
1400069289|5.0|This book by Charles Duhigg is amazing in ways I did not expect. It is  beautifully written and is quite understandable to any audience who dares to listen to the overriding issue. It speaks to the plasticity of the human mind, one which maintains the ability to grow and change with time, provided the individual learns to develop and consistently maintain habits. Habits develop quite slowly, as each of us are the creatures of habit who resist change if is causes one to feel pain or the habit is inconvenient to implement. The recovering alcoholic develops the habit of abstaining from drink one day at a time, and that action, over time, becomes a habit in many. In effect, the habit over time begins to change the brain on a molecular level. With persistence, the habit gradually takes root, replacing the habit of alcoholic drinking. Of course, it is much more complex than this, as the AA literature points out. &#34;Repetition strengthens and confirms habit, and faith becomes natural.&#34;  It can be shown in scientific studies in which sophisticated imaging studies are employed. The actual brain structure changes in ways once thought immutable. One single habit change can lead to others, i.e. smoking cessation or the development of other healthy lifestyle changes. The book is a remarkable resource for those in the business sector as well. Changing habits within stagnant organizations is not an easy task, but it can be effectively achieved. A+ read!
B000W21ER4|4.0|What can one say about this breakthrough album?  It's still as good today as it was the day I purchased it on CD waaay back ...
B009NG1Q96|2.0|I love the idea of this story line and it has real possiblities. However, the Author has no vision and is obviously just trying to get books out as fast as she can to make money. The abuse that shows up randomly in the middle of the second book with no prior hint of or signs of abuse was very far fetched and made the story dark and ugly. I also did not like that the author tried to make you accept the fact that even though someone is not faithful to you , it's ok..... Give them your heart anyway. That theme goes all the way around with all her characters and I feel truly lacks sustance and sends a very wrong message to teen readers. Really, she can do better!! Lastly this Author does not value her readers and loves to give you a unfinnished story. I love a good cliff hanger, but to just end a story in the middle is lazy and cheap! I feel like if I am going to give my money for a book the Author needs to give me a full story!!!  This book was sadly a disappointment.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|It picks up dirt and crumbs alright but glides right over anything flat like scraps of paper. It is not very powerful<br /><br />It works Ok but I was disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It is nice to seek a cute game that challenges .... without the required fighting or killing!  Keep bringing the cute Gameloft.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|It is an amazing movie!  Shipped super fast and it has been a wonderful addition to my dvd library!  Once again I am very satisfied with Amazon and my purchase.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed the game. It kept me entertained fot several hours. One complaint....some of the objects were hidden in places you could not possible find them.  But with the unlimited hints not  a problem, just frustrating.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|Great series for the Star Wars fan. Packaging was excellent and the extras are awesome. If your a die hard fan then you will love this series.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|I really love this CD! The bass this puts out in my car is amazing and it feels good! This is a cd, no, a band you can bump in your car and watch people's heads bob up and down when you pass by! Time won't wait...for you to buy this cd, you better hurry up! :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better! Best show on television! I have stayed up all night having a marathon because I want to know what happens next!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use it to sleep, stretch, relax and meditate.  I'm able to find a sound or melody for each occasion.  The only other App that comes close is Relax and Sleep in Play Store. But I have replaced it with this App. Very pleased. Of course new sounds and melodies are welcome.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game, easy to play. Lots of free credits per day! This is a challenging game and oddly addictive! I HIGHLY recommend it. Well worth the time. Beware of staying on too long, but it's really awesome. Some of the higher levels can get frustratingly difficult to get the items you need but there are lots if willing players to trade with you.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Our DVD did not work and was defective. Still have not received the replacement DVD so I can't know anything else about the story!!!!Very unhappy!!!! We reported it and still didn't revc the new one!!!!

B006G2124E|5.0|This movie is very touching yet funny! It will surely make you cry or at least become teary eyed. The acting is and storyline are in-sync. I recommend to anyone!
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a fun multifunctional game that has many features. Please get. It is really fun and has lots of features that make this game really interesting.!!!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Saw it in the theater, and purchased this for my parents. They loved it!! Would buy again in a heartbeat!
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I could not master the 16 chapters of instructions.  It was not the product that I needed or wanted.  It was sent back!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|After seeing it performed, I had to see it to thoroughly enjoy it! Now I have it in my collection to enjoy again. Should be in everyone's collection.
B004UHF51S|5.0|What a wonderful, delightful, romantic, playful, and happy album.  Perfect in every way.  Put away the computer, get a glass of wine, relax and enjoy.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Gave me a good information on the supply chain issues in the food industry in US and some horrible information on the meat processing... very upset!!!!
B0074MTTEK|4.0|The author writes with interesting style and colorful content.  It's a shame that the publisher didn't copyedit the book to fix the author's grammar and usage. No matter how well stated, text that misses on those counts can make the reader wonder what else wasn't checked. Too bad they weren't more careful, since it's such a compelling topic.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I love the movie, but I had a few come connection problems. I know my wifi connection quality was great, but the connection to Amazon want all that good and it resulted in a fuzzy picture at times.
B007TTFXC0|5.0|I originally bought this album via iTunes. I liked it SO MUCH, I also wanted a physical copy so I could have the lyrics booklet and a CD to play in my car, which does not have a jack for an MP3 player. So, yes, I spent double. Her first two CDs were outstanding. This one is even better. Her songs are upbeat and fun without sounding like every other pop song in existence. You get just enough of her fabulous Scottish accent to make it fun. Highly recommended. Buy this.
0066620996|4.0|Good To Great will really get you thinking about your organizational leadership.  The concept of &#34;first who, then what&#34; is often overlooked by management as many organizations try to make do with the resources they have, many of whom are not the right resources for both strategic and tactical processes.  Many other great concepts follow...
B00003CXCT|4.0|As a cinephile, I am always looking for new movies to watch.  A friend recommended the original Star Wars movies to me.  He knows I love movies about self discovery and learning about your family and place in this universe.  I was truly blown away by how good this trilogy was.  I'm going around telling everyone to watch it.  I told my Dad(Darth) about it.  He's a movie buff as well so he already had watched it when it first came out.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|It download this app for today and it is really really good but I had to delete 3 of my favorite apps
B005K17RU0|2.0|ok app but not as accurate as I was hoping it would be. There are better apps out there which are more accurate
B00APAENUI|4.0|This is one of my favorite books, ever!  Start the series at the beginning with Basilisk Station.  David Weber has done an incredible job with the Honor Harrington series.  The technical details and research that goes into these books is amazing.  In addition, his portrayal of this strong female heroin is wonderful.  I didn't think a straight man could see women like this!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Got it because of the hype. Its not bad but after a few games you seem to lose interested. I would recommend this game if you travel just to keep your mind off of waiting
B006IDG2T6|4.0|It's more than enough to get you thinking about a question as big as the free will question. I would recommend it as a starting point, but there a whole lot more on the topic you can find from other books.
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|Blue Remembered Earth is the best written work by Reynolds by SOME distance. It is beautifully written and edited, and reading it is a pleasure in itself. Compared to the style of his earlier work; somewhat opaque and tough reads, this is a gem. I would say that the reading experience was actually better, quicker and more satisfying than Redemption Ark and the like.<br /><br />That is not to say the story is better, it isn't ... but it IS very different in style and a book that you can finish fairly quickly.... a story that is (as you might expect) superbly crafted even if it doesnt have the peaks of excitement that some other Reynolds books have, and the imaginative ideas once again flow easily from Reynolds' pen; the use of golems, and the evolvarium are particularly well fleshed out, consistent and believeable.<br /><br />Where BRE falls down is the aforementioned lack of \\"peaks\\" and \\"troughs\\" in excitement. It is fairly linear in progression, with no real \\"set pieces\\" to stir the emotions, no tension or threat to the main characters ... and the ending, whilst \\"satisfying\\" (something not all Reynolds endings are)was not exactly an adrenalin rush, just a sort of \\"well here is a bit of exposition\\" to finish everything off tidily.<br /><br />So a mixed bag for me ... by far the best and most enjoyable Reynolds \\"read\\" but a story that was fairly simple, straightforward and not particularly exciting. On balance, however, I REALLY enjoyed the few days I spent on this book
B006M4F67A|3.0|There is no way to make them larger, They are to small to see even with my glasses. I love Mahjong, and this one could be better.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|This a aesome movie and Tom Cruise is just great. This movie will keep you guessing till the end. I have sugguested it 2 all of my friends.
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|There wasn't one redeeming feature to this entire movie.  The acting, writing, direction, and cinematography were all horrendous.  Thank God I didn't pay full movie theater prices for this trash.
B00821OX98|5.0|The production value and stories lines are top notch. My wife, who is not an SF fan by any stretch, really enjoys this series.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My grandson loves it.  Nice, safe and non violent game.  Lovely forms and colors, very esthetic and relaxing.  Love the music it plays !
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|ITS COOL!! I like it. It doesn't need wifi. I have had it for a month and I still like it.
B002IPG400|2.0|Difficult to read because of old English language style.  The theme and ambiance are fantastic, but it is so difficult to read because of the language style.  Old, too old, and makes it difficult to understand.  Got to keep going back and read again.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|Captivating drama/ comedy with Bryan Cranston as a very believable man caught in more than one crisis.<br /><br />Others have reviewed it already so I will list my favorite scenes:<br /><br />1) The bathtub<br />2) The arm scene at the junkyard<br />3) First meeting with Tuco<br />4) Buying the pants<br />5) \\"Ken Wins\\" BMW at Danny's Gas Station<br />6) Showing Jesse's house<br />7) Piecing together the broken plate<br />8) Poker Game<br />9) Chemistry class.<br /><br />I don't think I'll ever forget any of those scenes!<br /><br />Watch the extra on Season 1 disc 3--there is plenty there. \\"Taco Cabeza\\"--too funny! Is there really such a place?
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Nice but could do more stuff.  I love it when he repeats what one says.  Also, when it scratches the screen!
B000P6PVLC|3.0|Good acting, but when it ended, I was left wondering: What was the point?<br /><br />That guns can be bad?<br /><br />That teens drink alcohol and pop pills?<br /><br />That bad things happen to good people?<br /><br />That American tourists are fat and unconcerned?<br /><br />That 12-year-old boys should not be given .270 Winchester rifles and no training?<br /><br />That you should always pick up your spent brass?<br /><br />I already knew those things. I rate it 2.5.
B000H5TVO4|5.0|A greatest hits compilation by Roxette. It includes 20 of their biggest hits. I am happy that this album included my all time favorite Roxette song called ''Almost Unreal''.<br /><br />It also includes other great hits like ''The Look'', ''Dangerous'', ''Listen To Your Heart'', ''Joyride'', and ''Sleeping In My Car''.<br /><br />A good compilation for Roxette fans.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Excellent and convincing acting all the way around.<br /><br />One small decision, not to visit, changes two lives profoundly.<br /><br />How easy it is to say that persons of conscience should have killed themselves rather than follow evil orders. But how do we know what we would have done, if we were there? It is easy to say we would have done this or that, from the comfort of our easy chairs, a few minutes drive from a 24 hour fast food outlet.<br /><br />Kate Winslett deserves an award for her convincing character. Bruno Ganz is engaging as always. Can a teacher be that genuinely relaxed?<br /><br />The Reader is an important film, tackling important human issues in the human dilemma of what it means to take personal responsibility.
B000002UTT|5.0|Look Sharp! is one of Roxette's best albums. My personal favorite songs are ''The Look'', ''Sleeping Single'', ''Dance Away'', ''Chances'', and ''I Could Never Give You Up''. Their style is really varied on this album. Combining Pop, Rock, Soft Rock, and Dance. It's a great classic 80's album and I totally recommend it.
B000IDJNIY|4.0|Set in New York City's Lower East Side, and in New Orleans. Great 1950s feel.<br /><br />Cinematography is very well done. Allan Parker's commentary is well worth watching.<br /><br />Watching it a second time, it seems that those fingernails and slowly swirling fans and DeNiro's character's weird name should have told me something during the first viewing. I liked the parkerized swing-top S&W, the boiled egg peeling, and the St. Charles streetcar.<br /><br />Philip Marlowe meets The Exorcist.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great gan<br /><br />love to play right before bed relaxing logic puzzle game enjoy the complex thinking required to solve the levels
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was a heartfelt, yet unexpectedly entertaining story from the point of a dog named Enzo.<br />I honestly thought &#34;oh no, another dog book&#34;, but was greatly mistaken. I throughly enjoyed it and will pass it on to<br />my brother to read, as well.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I have to admit that I watch quite a bit of TV. That being said, Hannibal is one of my favorite shows of all time, even after watching just the handful of episodes that are already out. The acting is great - especially Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal. Laurence Fishburne, Hugh Dancy, and Caroline Dhavernas all stand out in their own ways as well. The characters are not simple caricatures, and seem to be as hard to figure out as people out in the real world. I believe this is the reason the show is so entertaining - I am left thinking about each episode long after it is over because of how puzzling and multidimensional these characters are. This may also have to do with how truly creepy this show is. The music is chilling and, when appropriate, absolutely beautiful. The cuisine and how carefully Hannibal eats it is exquisitely deranged. The filming and editing effects only add to the overall harrowing tone.<br /><br />Hannibal is uncomfortable to watch, but that combined with its acting, story, and artistry is what makes watching it such a unique and overall awesome experience.
076790592X|4.0|I'm really in two minds about this book which I probably would never have read if I hadn't picked it up at a church book sale recently for next to nothing. The cynical side of me thinks that the author, Mitch Albom saw his former teacher on Nightline talking about dying and hit on the idea of writing a book to cash in on the fame. He packaged their relationship into a clichéd little story about a man who has lost his way and forgotten the lessons of the past. Reconnecting with his teacher reminds him of what's important and he even learns to show emotion as Morrie hoped he would, conveniently shedding a tear on the final page before Morrie shuffles off his mortal coil. The lessons have all the depth and wisdom of a Hallmark greeting card.<br /><br />The less cynical side of me thinks that the lessons might seem simplistic, but that doesn't make them any less profound. People claim that they've heard it all before, that it's obvious you should live each day as if it's your last, open your heart and let yourself truly experience your emotions and be present in the moment, but how many people actually live like this? Maybe they need to be repeated in simple language for people to really understand and start putting into practice. This book could be a source of great comfort to those who are dying or who have a loved one who is terminally ill and for this reason I'm inclined to think less harshly of it.<br /><br />It was incredibly brave of Morrie to document his final journey in this way and whatever you think about the book it's clear that he would have been an amazing teacher. It's teachers like Morrie who try to give their students a wide-ranging humanist education that are needed now more than ever but sadly it' these very teachers who are being driven out as education is cut back to the bare bones. I really like Morrie's idea that people should create their own culture to combat the shallow, materialistic media culture that is constantly in our faces. This culture exists to make people feel unhappy and inadequate, compelling us to buy more to try to fill the emptiness inside that it has created. It's a vicious circle that cannot led to happiness and fulfilment, and Morrie had the right ideas about how to live a meaningful life, so even though the book itself wasn't much chop in my opinion I'm giving it four stars for Morrie
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Personally I am very disappointed about the games on PS Vita, only after this game released. Maybe some people think it is a kind of naive about stories in highschool. But this one, I like it.<br />I never played this series before, but I was attracted by P4G totally for sure. The combine of AVG-like story and the persona system is amazing. Fighting, adventuring, and developing relations with people. And the chars in this game all have vivid personalities. The main story has some depth in philosophy and self thinking, comes with lots traditional Japan anime style funny moments. This makes the story under a relaxing environment but remains some serious elements. Only one thing sad that there is no voice for yourself lol.<br />Do not even mention the multi-ending, which extends the life of this game. If anyone reaches the true-ending so far, I am pretty sure they will be kinda moved and glad about it, that moment keeps pulling you back into the story, and never ends.<br />In a word, if you are a JRPG fan and have a Vita, you cannot miss this one.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is a good time killer if you like puzzles. The hidden occurs were just hard enough, not to easy and not oh my god where the hell is it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was a wonderful story about a part of America that people may not know about. A great movie to watch after the Kentucky Derby
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This app is basically GTA IV with mid-graphics. However, there are strip clubs/night clubs, so don't let children play this. Not only that, but there is strong language, Strong Violence, and the inevitable black market for weapons and planes. So please, take my advice, parents, and keep it away from children.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Fantastic party game! We have been playing nonstop since it arrived. Easy setup, simple to learn yet challenging strategies make this game a must have!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have enjoyed the musical of &#34;Les Miserables&#34; many times, and am grateful that<br />Amazon has provided this English version of the original novel.  Having it on my kindle allows me to  easily take it along and slowly take in the flavor of Victor Hugo's magnificent story. This is surely a classic that should not be missed. If you know the story from the movie or theatre versions, this allows you to appreciate the times in which this was written and the distinctions of the classes, along with the feeling of moving forward with your beliefs.  It's truly a classic.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This is a page turner, as are all of Grisham's books.  I only have a few more to read and I am enjoying each and every one.  My favorite author!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I don't know how this one slipped under the radar of awards but it was stunning! Setting aside the great special effects of the tsunami and superb makeup for injuries- the acting  was top notch by every one of the actors (children included). But the script was the best of all...very compelling, emotionally intense, and heartwarming. In spite of the drama- it left me feeling hope for humanity.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I have enjoyed the benefits of Mr. Russinovich's work in the technology world for 15+ years now as a consumer of his Sysinternals Suite of tools and utilities. When I saw he had written Zero Day, I could not forgo reading it.<br /><br />Zero Day was a fascinating read for me, and I feel that the author has found a good balance between technical detail and not leaving the layperson in the lurch.<br /><br />Trojan Horse did not disappoint. Jeff and Daryl fell into a dire situation in this one as well, and were taken hostage to boot! I really enjoy the strong character he has in Daryl. Not your typical \\"damsel in distress\\" to be sure. I like how she is powerful and playful with her guy Jeff. They make a dynamite team.<br /><br />The description of how the Trojan Horse imbedded itself in the systems and inserted modified documents as email attachments *before* the digital signature was applied won me over.<br /><br />I am looking forward to Stuxnet4! ;)
B001HBYHFA|5.0|What can I say that the other reviewers have said. Nothing. The movie is awesome. Watch the series first. Buy it.
1613821395|3.0|Only sheer stubbornness allowed me to finish this book. It is chock full of great stuff: lies, greed, murder, intrigue, mistaken & assumed identity, infidelity, lunatic asylum, etc.... but the age and slow pacing make it very hard to persevere for a modern reader (like me) who has seen so many movies and television shows. The tale unfolds in the form of testimony from different characters who participate in the drama/mystery at different points in time (somewhat epistolary), and I didn't find all of the voices believable (a vast improvement over Collins' friend Dickens where I found none of the voices believable). I picked this up because I became interested in Wilkie Collins after reading [[ASIN:B005EP26IK Drood]].
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. You make friends for building your team and you get to play in real time with your facebook friends.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I do love it.  A very fun game time. and I'm enjoying it very much.  It can be pretty adictive.  Thanks,  Judith
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did!  Wreck It Ralph kept you guessing and had a great story line.  Our whole family thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  (we've watched it several times, since!)
B000Q79HS8|5.0|I love all the Bourne movies.  I'm not sure which is my favorite but they're all worth watching.  All good movies.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It's a great read to the last words. Thought provoking lots of twist and turns. I recommend it to parents.
B00130UFY2|5.0|I love all the Bourne movies.  I'm not sure which is my favorite but they're all worth watching.  All good movies.
141659521X|5.0|This book lives up to Vince Flynn's reputation for writing exciting books. It kept my attention from beginning to end.
B007A4SDCG|2.0|I found this book overhyped and really not that beneficial.  The message is essentially that there is a force out there preventing you from being constructive (which I don't disagree with).  Pressfield basically communicates that you just need to sit down and do your work.  No real revelation there.  The book is not boring, Pressfield keeps you engaged and interested but I just didn't get much out of this book.<br /><br />The hardest part of being creative and getting stuff done is sitting down to start working.  Once you start working, keep working, plow through &#34;dry spells,&#34; and viola!  Just be diligent, make a schedule, force yourself to work.  That's about all I got from this book.  Unless I added some of that myself..
B00CBRADU2|4.0|I'd say it was a fun ride the entire time.  Arnold does what he does best by whooping up on some bad guys.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book definitely kept me wanting to read on.  I had a hard time putting in down. I did have it kind of figured out a couple of times but would rethink it and decide I was wrong.  In the end I did have it kind of figured out but that didn't make it any less of an exciting ride. Excellent read.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I'm always a little bit nervous going into the second book of a series, when the first one was so good.  This however, did not disappoint.  The story progresses nicely, and it's just as much a page turner as the first one.  Again, highly recommend this series to YA or adults.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Love this album! Cruise is the best song on the album! This is definitely a must have album! Highly recommended
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I enjoy a series and have read some YA ones, over time.  This is one of the best YA series that I've read to date.  I just couldn't put it down, always wanting to know what was going to happen next.  Thankfully I hadn't discovered this book until all three had been released so didn't have to wait for the next.  I read all three one after the after, and never tired of it.  Great story that flowed nicely and was fast paced.  I highly recommend this series to YA or for adults.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It has such a wonderful and interesting story.  The acting is supurb and the characters are so believeable.  One of the best I have watched in a long time.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This is one of those series where you feel sad that you've come to an end.  The whole three books take you on a thrilling journey and was a very enjoyable read.  The characters are all well developed and the plot was exciting.  This is one of those stories you can spend the entire day, drawn into it and completely lose track of time.  Highly recommend this series to YA and adults.

B003BVFZ4G|3.0|I read this after having seen The Hunger Games comparison to this and was a bit disappointed.  It was an okay read, and certainly wasn't bad, but just didn't quite live up to what I had expected.  I'm sure it was good in it's day and original at the time, but is probably a bit dated now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OK so in all fairness...this game ROCKS! Zip lining, waterfalls, cliffhanging adventures and that's all just in first 1000m you go! There's abandoned mine cars  but definitely keep your eyes open because your next turn may be your last! But BEWARE: this game is HIGHLY addictive! (I only wished Amazon updated as soon as Google Play Store, hopefully its coming soon!)

B000AGTPUU|5.0|This movie has been watched over and over, not just a holiday film! My 2 sons asked that I leave this movie out all year long! When I packed away our other holiday movies, this one was requested to stay on our movie shelf. As a mom, I love the lessons and values taught in this brilliant movie, starring the voice talent of Tom Hanks!

B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Okay, I am really bad at this game. I've only won once at the easiest level. A challenging but fun game.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|I read the novel prior to seeing the movie and while I'm well aware that it's impossible to adapt a book in its entirety into a movie, I was a bit disappointed by this particular adaptation.<br />There were characters and valid details that were missing, there were plot points (and just plots in general) completely re-warped, the six story lines were scattered all over the place and unnecessary detail was added as well.  I'm not sure what the directors were thinking when they made some of these changes, but it's because of them that made the movie a not-as-well executed adaptation of this David Mitchell novel.<br />What I will say is that I thought it was creative using the same actors throughout the same storylines, to indicate the influence of Buddhism on \\"Cloud Atlas.\\"  I also have to say that the actors and actresses were excellent in their performances (in particular Halle Berry and Doona Bae).<br />I understand that this wasn't exactly the easiest film to create, but I honestly think the directors could have done better in sticking closer to the book.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Great looking app, works great. Really useful and easy to use on my Android phone. The summary talks about using it on a Kindle Fire but it works great on a phone also.
0812984412|5.0|If you're one of those people who think you know all about \\"Cloud Atlas\\" from watching the movie, then I've partially lost faith in humanity.  I have this saying that \\"You can't judge a book from its film adaptation.\\"<br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is officially marked as one of my favorite books.  Not only do you benefit more from the characters, details and plot lines that were either re-warped or just didn't make it into the movie, but it's also much more organized too, in an incredibly unique way; kind of like Russian dolls (as it's commonly compared to).  \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a consistency of six beautiful stories throughout time that really show the power of humanity and present before the reader the theme of freedom in various formats.  It's an uncommonly incredible masterpiece that I now have the pleasure of saying that I've read- and it was an honor in doing so.
B000AQJPQE|1.0|I bought this product a few months ago when I was planning to kove to our new house.<br />We finally moved and the thingy has been installed with batteries (placed in the right position) and everything and...... It's not working!!<br />We're so disappointed!
B003QSLW0K|5.0|We love that Lilo is not super thin and her sister the adult woman is pretty, but has full thighs and calves and a wide nose.<br /><br />If that weren't enough, it has a fun story with music by Elvis and a great message about families sticking together.  Best of all it holds that families that are little and &#34;broken&#34; (dead parents because it's a Disney movie so parents need to be dead of course) can also be &#34;still good.&#34;  As a parent of a divorced family, it's nice that the kids see our family (smaller now) as &#34;still good&#34; too.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|i like alot of heroes in one movie ,and thats the movie is the best iv ever seen since i know he comics ,the movie have alot of things ,it had drama and comedy and alot of good actions !
1401216676|5.0|This was recommended to me by a good friend.  I've always been a huge Batman fan, and my favorite character has always been the Joker.  A good friend of mine told me years ago that I should pick this up when I get the chance.  I've had it on my wishlist for years and just kept forgetting about it.  I finally got around to buying it and I do not regret it one bit.  I could not put it down.  The art work was amazing.  However, the story was so riveting.  I was sucked it from the moment I started reading and was done with the book within an hour.  I'll most likely go back and re-read and study the art in more detail since I rushed through it the first time, eager to find out what happened.  Even if you aren't a huge fan of the Joker like myself, still an excellent read!!
B009K45Y62|5.0|i love the series of batman and thats the the 3rd movie ,the collector is a great collection because its have a statue of a broken bat mask ,looks pretty nice also i got 4 discs of the movie with behind the scenes and also a digital download of the movie ,if you love batman then get this one! :)

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|The Tourist(released Dec/10)stars,among others,Angelina Jolie as Elise Clifton-Ward,Johnny Depp as Frank Tupelo,Paul Bettany as Insp.John Acheson,Timothy Dalton as Chief Insp. Jones,Steven Berkoff as Reginald Shaw and others.I found this to be a very,very pleasant and enjoyable film to watch.The intrigue,the mystery,the plot twists and turns and the solid acting,all help propel this little number along.<br />The story finds Depp as the titled \\"Tourist\\".However,the movie starts out as the police in Paris,assisted by Scotland Yard in London,are busy following Jolie.Jolie is an ex Yard agent who they hadn't seen for a long time and who has been connected with one Alexander Pearce.Pearce it seems stole mega millions from a very nasty European mob boss,and not only are the police after him(thru Jolie),but the boss wants his bucks back pronto.At a cafe where Jolie sits a note is delivered to her via courier(from Pearce)and it tells her to board a train and head to Venice.Also it says to find and chat up another man on the train who has roughly the same build as him,so the police suspect that man is actually him.<br />The man Jolie chats up is our own Johnny Depp,a math teacher from Wisconsin.Depp of course becomes intrigued by this lovely enchantress sitting across from him.Jolie also feels an attraction but hides her feelings.In Venice she and Depp end up sharing a luxurious hotel suite there;Jolie sleeping in her own room,Depp on the couch.The next morning Jolie has left and is awoken by a servant bringing breakfast.When the servant leaves two thugs from the mob bosses`gang show up and Depp takes off across some rooftops to elude the men.He ends up being arrested.The policeman who interrogates him ,during the night,takes him out and delivers him into the hands of the mob boss,for a tidy payment.Jolie comes to the rescue and they both end up out in the Venetian harbour in a boat.Next morning Jolie delivers Depp to the airport and tells him to leave.<br />With Depp now gone,Jolie goes back to Scotland Yard and agrees to help her superiors in Pearce`s capture.She is wired and she attends a ball that night,as per the instructions of Pearce,through notes.Once there she is given another note by a man who rushes away.She follows him calling Pearce`s name.Who should suddenly appear,but Depp.They dance for a short time until she breaks off and leaves.The police,who are there en masse,take Depp into custody.They sequester Depp in the surveillance van,while Jolie is now inside a room,looking for a safe she was instructed to go to.In barges the mob boss with his men,who forces Jolie to tell him where the safe is.All this time police snipers on a nearby roof have had their guns trained on all of the baddies in the room,but the Yard cop in charge keeps delaying any firing;hoping for the appearance of the elusive Pearce.Jolie tries once to enter the safe code but fails and is given one more chance.Depp`s admonitions to the cops to jump into action to save Jole have fallen on deaf ears.Before the cops realize it,Depp has escaped the van,gone and entered the room from its balcony and now is inside confronting the boss,and pretending he is Pearce.As things look their worst the cop in charge`s boss comes in and orders the snipers to fire,which they do,taking down everyone but Depp and Jolie.As the two stand there Depp asks her how she now feels about him and this Pearce fellow.She replies she loves them both.Depp replies he may have a solution to the problem.Depp enters the safe code and opens it,something he would never have known if he wasn`t..... .The police arrive and Depp and Jolie are gone.They blow the closed safe to find a cheque made out in the amount that Pearce had stolen.<br />The film winds down as Depp and Jolie ply across the Venice harbour on a sailboat.Jolie makes the comment about all the money he spent on his facial reconstruction,and that was the best he could do? Depp asks ``you don`t like it``? Jolie says it will have to do.<br/>Not only is the acting quite solid in this film,but it is all ably boosted by the cinematography and the beautiful background music.In fact at some parts,I saw some visual touches of Hitchcock, and could almost picture Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in these same roles.This movie definitely has touches of cinema from a by gone day,and it is rare to see that nowadays.The movie`s tension/intrigue starts out from the get go and I found it rarely let up until the two are sailing into the sunset.That nice twist ending was also a bonus.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,outtakes,an alternate animated opening and two featurettes.<br />All in all a nicely done film with elements of mystery and intrigue coupled with a light sexual tension between the two leading characters.It`s visual and audio touches really enhance the entire look and feel.Highly recommended./>Not only is the acting quite solid in this film,but it is all ably boosted by the cinematography and the beautiful background music.In fact at some parts,I saw some visual touches of Hitchcock, and could almost picture Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in these same roles.This movie definitely has touches of cinema from a by gone day,and it is rare to see that nowadays.The movie`s tension/intrigue starts out from the get go and I found it rarely let up until the two are sailing into the sunset.That nice twist ending was also a bonus.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,outtakes,an alternate animated opening and two featurettes.<br />All in all a nicely done film with elements of mystery and intrigue coupled with a light sexual tension between the two leading characters.It`s visual and audio touches really enhance the entire look and feel.Highly recommended.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is probably one of the most important films of my lifetime.  Personally, my family has known someone who grew up in East Germany before the wall came down, and the description of the before and after could not be better captured.  The experience has been described as living in black and white, and then moving to color.  The movie is subtitled, but the film is well done and would seem unnatural in English.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I liked this story however the last 3%(kindle speak:)) really ruined it for me. I felt the author rushed it to completion. It left me frustrated.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Tom cruise is not jack reacher.  He should have made a movie with a similar plot and left the reacher character alone.

B00BB22GQM|3.0|As a fan from the very beginning, Vampire Weekend's  2008 self-titled debut album is for me one of the more accomplisdhed debut albums in the last 10 years. And the second album \\"Contra\\" (from 2010) was pretty darn good too. Now, after 3+ years away, finally comes the band's highly anticipated third album.<br /><br />\\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" (12 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with an immediately pensive, piano-led \\"Obvious Bicycle\\". The energy level goes up a notch or two with \\"Unbelievers\\". Track 4 \\"Diane Young\\" (1st single) is the best track on the album for me, reminding me of the band's earlier output. But after that it's mostly back to mid-tempo tunes (\\"Don't Lie\\", \\"Everlasting Arms\\", \\"Ya Hey\\"), or outright slow songs or ballads, Vampire Weekend-style of course (\\"Hannah Hunt\\", \\"Hudson\\", \\"Young Lion\\"). There are a couple more flashes of the band we used to know late into the album on \\"Finger Back\\" and \\"Worship You\\".<br /><br />I bought this album last week, sound unheard, and purposefully did not post my review right away, as I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Now a week on, I can tell you that my feelings for this album have not improved. I scroll thrugh the many 5 star reviews posted on here, and I'm thinking to myself \\"did we listen to the same album\\"? I would sum up the situation as follows: listen to the opening tracks of the three VW albums one after another: \\"Mansard Roof\\" from VW, \\"Horchata\\" from Contra, and \\"Obvious Bicyle\\" from this album, and you'll know all you need to grasp the differences: Vampire Weekend has matured &lt;gasp>, yes the dreaded maturity has done it again. If you like the fun, breezy, clever sounds from the first two albums, you will likely be disappointed with the new album, as the musical landscape on \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" is MILES away from the previous albums. Buyer beware!<br /><br />*UPDATE* (Oct '13) I saw Vampire Weekend in concert this past weekend at the Corona Capital festival in Mexico City. They brought a tremendous 75 min. set, mixing new and old tunes, and I must say that the new songs resonate live much better than on the album. The massive crowd just ate it up. If you have a chance to see them live, do not miss them!ght a tremendous 75 min. set, mixing new and old tunes, and I must say that the new songs resonate live much better than on the album.

B00571F26Y|4.0|I knew that the incidence of gluten intolerence has increased over the last few years but had no idea of how widespread this problem is.  The wheat that is grown these days has changed so dramatically from what our ancestors grew.  This book is definetely one we should all read.  With all the autoimunne diseases these days (most of which are caused by inflamation), we should all take note of the food that we are eating.  Would definetely recommend this book

B009GEFXLC|2.0|Really loved Castle when it had a layered storyline (Beckett's mother, the serial killer, etc) and when it had connectedness with characters.  This season has lost the magic.  It's episodic, contrived and tired.  The character chemistry is gone as we see little of Alexis and Castle's mother and the relationship with Beckett and Castle lacks substance.  The one-liners and stories are mostly predictable and the season finale was anti-climatic.  And what's with the cameo appearance of Beckett's Dad?  We never see the guy and suddenly we are supposed to connect with a moment when she is at a crossroads and meets him for coffee for advice? Blah. Wishing they would have tied it up neatly a season ago as I'm finding that I don't really care what happens now.

B007NWCZR4|5.0|This is Pet Shop Boys' second B-side compilation, and there's not really much to say about it other than it's just a fine collection.  Like Alternative before it, you get two full discs of outtake goodness.  It doesn't flow like one of their studio albums since it's just random tracks in chronological order, but to expect that is just being unrealistic.  This is an album for PSB fans and for collectors who want all the B-sides together on one album.  Not an album for the casual PSB fan.  The booklet features an in-depth interview with the Boys as they describe each track individually...a very nice treat!  Definitely worth checking out.
B00CHILW64|5.0|This is a movie about family, love and the strength to never give up. It is heartbreaking as well as heartwarming. Great acting and filled with suspense.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Loved playing Star Wars Pinball on my Fire, very easy and cool. I highly recommend it! Hubby even played it and enjoyed it!
B007MDB6L0|1.0|I give this product 1 star not because I hate the movie, because I love everything tinkerbell, but because when I finally decided to open the movie this evening, the disc that was in it was plastic, no movie in the box. I am very disappointed. Going to try and send it back, but I waited too long to open it and the return date has expired.

1452101248|3.0|I am always on the prowl for the latest and the greatest cookbook. Everyone has their preferences and I lean toward cookbooks that feature fresh ingredients, gourmet preparations and presentations, and an international flair.<br /><br />I picked up Plenty: Vibrant Vegetable Recipes from London's Ottolenghi by Yotam Ottolenghi with these criteria in mind about a year ago when it was making the rounds as the hot new vegetarian cookbook. The author is originally from Israel and so of course middle eastern culture, ingredients, and technique heavily influence his repertoire. He owns a restaurant in London and for several years he wrote a column for The Guardian press on vegetarian cuisine. Pretty good for a chef who isn't actually a vegetarian. He became well known for his creativity with fresh vegetables and the recipes laid out in Plenty are those that have appeared over the years in his Guardian column.<br /><br />The cookbook itself is beautiful. The cover art (a shot of a row of roasted eggplants dressed with a yogurt pomegranate sauce) is appetizing and inviting and the book has a soft, thick, and durable cover. The recipes are organized according to main ingredient (a chapter on tomatoes for example) and there are many hand drawn illustrations throughout the book as well as full color photographs of prepared recipes.<br /><br />Although the recipes are vegetarian, they are not vegan- eggs, yogurt, and cheese are featured frequently. For those who prefer not to exclude meat, I'm happy to advise that Ottolenghi's recipes often provide an excellent base for meals to which meat can easily be included.<br /><br />Things I have made from this cookbook:<br /><br />Leek fritters<br />These were alright. Saut&eacute;ed leeks and shallots, folded into an egg batter and fried. We dressed them with the suggested accompanying yogurt cilantro sauce and while I found them acceptable and would eat them again, I don't get overly excited at the thought of them; they don't make me drool with anticipation.<br /><br />Chard and saffron omelets<br />This dish is a good way to get greens into your diet. A very thin omelet is prepared with a heavy handful of fresh herbs from the garden mixed in, then it's stuff with cooked Swiss chard and sliced potatoes and drizzled with a light garlic yogurt sauce. It was pretty good, but the general audience I cooked it for asserted it would be even better with bacon crumbled into the filling.<br /><br />Celeriac and lentils with hazelnut and mint<br />I thought this dish was very good, but again better suited as a side than a main entr&eacute;e. You can't really go wrong with hazelnuts! I'd definitely recommend this as a side to grilled lamb. That would be fabulous and the flavors would play off each other well.<br /><br />Jerusalem artichokes with Manouri and basil oil<br />This recipe was difficult to source. I'll save you some time and let you know than in most of the United States, Jerusalem artichokes (which don't look like artichokes at all) are referred to as sunchokes and they're actually a root vegetable. Finding them, and the Manouri cheese took trips to several different grocery stories before I lucked out (Wegman's for the win!). As for the taste of the finished dish, again it was ok. It didn't blow my socks off but it wasn't terrible either.<br /><br />Recommended with reservations<br /><br />I guess I'm leading to a conclusion that, at least for me, the flavors expressed in Ottolenghi's recipes are good (and good for you) but not strong enough to stand on their own. I plan to fall back on these recipes as side dishes for my non-vegetarian main entrees. I do have a number of other vegetarian cookbooks that feature recipes that are bold and spicy, or rich and deeply flavorful and those are the sorts of recipes that I can center a whole meal around. I can't wholeheartedly recommend the book for vegetarians who won't have meat to rely on to carry the meal. And of course this book is probably not forthose who don't a taste for middle eastern cuisine (lots and lots of yogurt, lemons, fresh herbs, olive oil).n't a taste for middle eastern cuisine (lots and lots of yogurt, lemons, fresh herbs, olive oil).

To the potential reader: There are several things I can't stand about the writing style (I've only read Morgan's books in this series) but lets start with the positive. I like the story - that is the only reason it gets two stars.  That is what kept me going for two books longer than I should have. I can't stand the writing. I am not reading any further because I can't justify spending the time and money on another book. Buyer beware. The series is bound to go on for another 3 or 4 books milking you for very little in return. I am not the target age but I wouldn't justify this for a YA reader because the writing is so poor. Compare this to a book like \\"Holes\\" and you will see a huge difference in the value of the writing.<br /><br />#2. (Unsolicited) Advice: The writing style in these books is too forced and awkward - I can no longer stomach the reading.  Morgan often resorts to using strong emotion to avoid describing a scene.  It is lazy writing.  Some examples: we constantly hear that the heroin is (paraphrasing) \\"feeling the strength of her father, more than EVER\\".  But every few chapters she's feeling it again and it is \\"stronger than EVER\\". Another example of lazy writing is when Gwen takes Thor to her \\"secret\\" place. After a very short description of a rather unimpressive building we are told that it is the most AMAZING thing Thor has ever seen. There is no time for us to get a feel for what makes this place beautiful other than Thor's shallow reaction - and it's about the tenth most AMAZING thing he has seen.  The emotions the characters feel in order for us to understand the story are always so extreme as to become underwhelming due to over use. It seems like a cheap trick and ends up becoming very tiring. Good writing allows you to feel the emotion and doesn't try to force it down your throat. In other scenes, different characters take an inordinate amount of time reasoning through something in the middle of a fight or other time sensitive problem and they think harder than ever and then think even harder a couple seconds later.<br /><br />I could go on with examples but I won't. It is upsetting to me because Morgan has a great imagination. This story has so much potential. She just can't write - or won't take the time to do it properly. Sorry, but I would say DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

B00BB22GQM|5.0|Modern Vampires of the City just made me fall in love with Vampire Weekend all over again. Wonderful album with great sounds.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|Brilliant and Accomplished musicians continue to deliver smooth jazz that enables the mind to relax!!  FourPlay set the tones for  weddings, cocktail parties, dinner parties, and chew and chat sessions!! They really create the atmosphere!!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love this album! FOB did a great job coming back with something that sounds familiar, but also has an awesome new feel to it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I've read this trilogy more than once on my Kindle. Although the storyline is intriguing, the descriptive narrative is potent and holds one's attention page after page. However, I would be very selective about the people to whom I would recommend this trilogy, since one is often judged by the books one reads. (It's much like masturbation: most people do it, but very few will admit to it, much less discuss it.) I applaud the author's ability to treat the subject matter with such honesty and grace.<br />There are several things I enjoyed about the trilogy, for example; a strong, female lead, although it's a subtle pliable strength that many women strive to emulate, especially when dealing with dominate male partners; descriptive dialogue, except the overuse of \\"holy\\" and \\"oh my\\" which became repetitious; well-developed characters, especially Ana's inner goddess, and her conscience; an intricate plot with believable twists and surprises, especially Ana's training to protect herself against unwanted advances, resorting to the use of a firearm when the situation demanded it to protect her life and that of her family members; but most of all I loved the happy ending.<br />I hope Ms. James writes sequels to focus on the lives of the other interesting characters in the trilogy; Kate, Elliott, Jose, Mia, Ethan, Taylor, and Mrs. Jones.
0142407542|5.0|This was just a continuation of the first book. We love it so much. It has the same rhythms and rhymes as the first.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I was laughing so hard when I watched this movie. The humor is based on things in life, reaktiinship and parenting that are so real. They're things that every one thinks but few have the balls to say.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I stumbled onto the first season of Downton Abbey quite by accident and enjoyed following both \\"families\\" upstairs and down. The writing is excellent and the story lines amusing and engaging. I enjoyed all of the seasons since and was surprised by the deaths of Sybil and Matthew, but not shocked. Both lead further into great drama and add the suspense of the \\"cliff hanger\\" for the next season to begin upon. The addition of the naughty cousin Rose may make some new inroads with the story line. With Mary now widowed with a son, and Tom now a widower with a daughter, who knows what tangled plot may now ensue? There is always more backstabbing and sneakiness to be sure between the likes of Thomas and Miss O'Brien, so I think all is not lost. Maggie Smith as the Matriarch is pure gold. She's my favorite! If a face could launch a thousand ships, her expressions could easily wipe out an entire Navy!! She's no sourpuss...she's just a powerhouse! She can say more with one look than most can say with pages of dialogue. I look forward to season 4 and hope there will be more.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game because it has amazing graphics its fun and you never run out of money I love this game
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this. Could not put my kindle down! I would recommend this to anyone that likes a good game. Can't wait for the next one!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I find it very challenging especially with two suits.  Don't have 11 more words to say about anything.  That's all.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I just finished reading the book so I wanted to see the movie. Why do they even have the same name? It is barely even \\"based\\" on the book. It was a really good book - I can't imagine why they totally rewrote it and changed everything about it. I mean they even changed the mother's name. Completely changed the Dad's character and the brother's. The therapist was super important but he was hardly even in the movie. I could go on and on. Terrible, terrible adaptation.
B00C2C637I|4.0|This was my first Ray Bradbury book...seems amazing that I had never read Bradbury.  I was aware of his work through television and films, but had never picked up a book, and I am glad that I selected this book.<br />It is a coming of age story and how the world rushes up to pull us from our care free childhoods into the dark entreaties that rush toward us, to rob us of that innocence.<br />The tempo of the prose races as fast as boys running for the sheer joy of it. An exciting read with many life lessons written by a man who obviously loves words for the sake of themselves and the power of what they evoke.<br />I have just become a Ray Bradbury fan.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really like this app.  My daughter and I were really enjoying it.. but now it has stopped.  You go to play and it pops up saying it has stopped.. I don't know if they are working on it, but it has been a week since we could play.. I deleted it and then reloaded it but that still hasn't helped.  Anyone know what is going on??  Otherwise it was fun while it lasted.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|i had hundreds of slides from the 60's and 70's  and it it made it easy to convert to digital on my computer.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It's based on a very good story.  It's well told, but Argo is definitely not the best film of 2012.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Truly a beautiful looking app... it's like you know you did good when there's nothing left to take away - this app scores BIG here!<br /><br />What's really neat is how you have 3 sets of numbers to click on, each representing the fraction:<br />- One set for the whole number<br />- One set for the Numerator<br />- One set for the Denominator<br /><br />Yes you can argue that, have the 3 sets negates my 1st comment but in this app, it really feels like a requirement, for the sake of simplicity!<br /><br />I like also that the app, when providing your answer, also shows you the DECIMAL equivalent.<br /><br />But, it would REALLY be nice (hence not 5 stars) to go the other way.<br />...to start out with a Decimal Expression and have it convert to a Fraction expression...<br /><br />Since the app doesn't give you a decimal point; alas, this is not possible...<br /><br />So... gimmie a decimal point AND backward conversions (from decimal to fractional notation), and you get 10 stars!!! :)
1451627297|5.0|This book  had just enough supernatural elements to keep me interested, but not so many as to turn me off. It was a trip down a possible yet improable memort lane . I enjoyed the tender ending.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I love this movie. Anthony Andrews has become one of my favorite stars after seeing this movie. I would recommend this film.<br />I have even shared it with a friend.
0143117009|3.0|This book was a bit too much for me.The subject is intriguing buttoo much information for me to process effectively.
193700788X|2.0|Charlaine Harris gave up.  That is the only possible explanation for this last Stackhouse novel.  For the last several novels Sookie has been in love with Eric and now all of a sudden he divorces her and all she feels is relief.  It just doesn't make sense.  The other characters in the book seem to appear just so they can say a quick goodbye and that's it.  For the past two novels, I feel as if Charlaine Harris lost interest in the series and just wanted to be done with it.  Judging by the finale, she did just that.  So sad.  It's fine that \\"True Blood\\" sucks.  I didn't have high expectations for it, but I became invested in the books.  It's very disappointing, but that's life.  For anyone who has not read the last two books (especially the last one), don't bother.  It will just make you angry.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|This movie just showcased J Law in the role of a younger character..  meh.  Silver Linings Playbook was much better.  And I think the mature role thing works for her better.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A must read for any IT manager or staff member that works in development of software. This book really brings to light so many interconnected parts of IT and business. Anyone looking to learn how to do DevOps right needs to grab this book NOW!!!
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|Im a person that reads the book before seeing the movie and i learned long ago that the movies are never like the book. If i would have never read this book i would have gave it 5 stars and put it up there with The Notebook as a fav! I still really enjoyed this one and will add it to my dvd collection. :)
B009WO7NQO|3.0|There's not enough variety between games. It gets boring pretty quickly. Although the music is fun and keeps it more interesting. Without music, might be a 2 star.
B00068TJM6|5.0|This Seiko SNA411 is an excellent and good looking watch that matches all the positive reviews on the various web sources. Delivery was prompt. Seiko & other web sources provide adequate instruction for the slide rule functions.
1400052181|5.0|At Johns Hopkins, cells are taken from Henrietta Lacks. She is a black lady and it was a time when experimental procedures might be done without permission or<br />informed consent. The cells grow and then are used around the world. The cells are now immortal.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book just made favorite books of all time list, and its pretty close to the top. Ho ender, speaker for the dead.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This disc is awesome; they ALL put on a flawless show.  The quality of the disc is perfect, crystal clear.  I was blown away.<br /><br />Sade and her music are so incredibly gorgeous and timeless, classic and elegant, absolute perfection.  She has the best lyrics and music ever in my opinion.  The best artist in history.  Sade continues to amaze and wow us.<br /><br />I have been following Sade ever since I saw her on \\"The Tonight Show\\" in the 80's.  So, I say thank you Sade for all the joy you've brought your fans through the years and for making our lives a little sweeter.<br /><br />Sade, your music will always be \\"King\\".
B003XQPYR2|5.0|I enjoyed the action, story and way it was filmed.  Now am waiting on my husband to watch the movie. I know he will enjoy it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Superb acting, intricate and intelligent plot line, well developed characters, Shakespearian in scale of themes dealt with, cinematic in scope, wonderful drama.
B00BWJ6JO4|1.0|Very disappointed. It was just a re-mash of the original movie.  Seems they just wanted to make more money from the original. Actually am sorry I threw money away on it.  Shame on them!
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I relay a lot of the book content to my own experience.  Of course I am way not as successful as Amy is.  I often think not every kid can be forced to do things that parents think it's best for them.  I often confused.  My parents had never made me and my siblings do anything.  We grow up just as responsible and independent as most people.  One thing I do agree that my mom had never said &#34;good job&#34;, &#34;you are great&#34; that kind phrases to us.  If she said, &#34;it's alright&#34;, I took it as huge accomplishment .  My self esteem was never lowered by that.  Anyway, l totally understand but don't 100% agree the Chinese way of parenting.  I don't  agree western parenting 100% either.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|So enjoyed the movie, Russell Crowe was amazing.  Young Cosette just blew me away with her talent.  Truly one musical I have watched over and over, not to mention the number of times I've read the book.  If you enjoy the book I think you will truly enjoy the movie. It stayed quite true to the book but not totally true. Did not change any of the depth of humanity  or inhumanity of the story by the changes.  I do like the end of the movie better than the book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i love this game. its like having my own little salt water aquarium with all the wonder of beautiful fish and coral. the colors are vivid and dazzling. if you want to progress without waiting too long you may have to spend money but its not a must do. two thumbs up.
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie and were moved by the sensitivity and depth of the actors.  Very thought provoking.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The best book I've ever read. Thank you for this beautiful piece of writing. Just wow. I love it. Will read again.
B001RPIYV4|5.0|Studying Romeo & Juliet in 9th grade lit class and enjoyed watching this movie.  This movie is fast moving and gives a new energy after reading the script of Romeo & Juliet.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|It was worth twice the money just for tracks 10 and 11, beach boys vocals are at the top of their game
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased the cover for my wife so she can carry her Kindle with her everywherewe go and keep it protected. The durability is great. It doesn't add any thickness or bulk and is very lightweight. She uses it mostly to read but have now found it very useful it the kitchen. Great for displaying her recipes as she cooks! Only down fall I found was the stand isn't very stable. If it locked into place the design would be great!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I gave this to my granddaughter yesterday for her birthday. Her parents bought her a Kindle Fire (as she was always playing with mine) and purple is her favorite color. She was very excited to receive this!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is awesome.  It is exactly what I need.  I couldn't ask for any thing more.  Good job!
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|Maybe when I get use to this mouse, I will love it but it's almost too high tech for me.  I really have trouble controlling it but that may come with time and experience.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|He hooks you and draws you into the lives of his characters. You become part of the timeline. You feel all of the intensity. I will be reading more and more Baldacci.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is one of the best new HOG I have played in quite a while. The only thing I really did not like was the constant backtracking to previous scenes. Way too many trips up and down in the elevator just seemed to waste time. I liked it enough to want a sequel, though.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I'm a big Tina Fey fan, so I am likely a bit biased this book.  Funny stories, quick read, great SNL behind the scenes stories.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I LOVE this movie, Great actress.  I love the movie and can watch it over and over.  I love all of Emma Stones movies.
1452113432|5.0|This is a beautiful cookbook with simple, fresh French recipes.  Even if you never cook a single recipe, it is worth buying as a gorgeous coffee table book.  Rachel Khoo is very talented and I loved her BBC cooking show by the same name.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This was great for 2 bucks but I still would  have hoped for something a bit longer. I'd like to have played longer. It was something that definitely makes you think hard
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is the most exciting seanson of Fringe so far.  Lots of things happening, in more than one place.  Not just events, but relationships as well. After season 3, you are definitely hooked for season 4.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Was very happy when I found it they finally made a greatest hits CD for Kelly Clarkson. Seriously need this in the car. Turn it up!
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|I am giving this book a 4 star rating, so why didn't I choose a lower star rating?  Becaude Pink presents a paradigm shift with our views of sales people being of the &#34;used car&#34; salesman all out aggressive sales mentality type to including us all, doctors, software engineers and even accountants. He really does make you see that we are all in sales, moving others.  &#34; The ability to move others to exchange what they have for what we have is crucial to our survival and our happiness.&#34;. Read this book and discover what the 21 st century requires of us if we really want to move people!
B004I1AGTC|3.0|The first IP Man movie is one of my most favorite movies of all time and I just had to watch this one, too. This one is satisfying and is beautiful but the plot did not draw me in with strong emotions as it did in the first movie. Glad I got it to watch, but it's not memorable.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is a great book to help you with the drama that always seems to come up in your life to take you off course. The Power of Now helps you stay in the moment so that you can deal with events in your life that pull your attention into either the past where guilt lies, or into a future that takes you into dread or assumptions about what might happen. Read some of Gina Lakes books to help you practice being in the now.
B003INBNXO|5.0|This movie had me laughing, crying, cheering. Extremely well-done! Will be one of my favorite movies that I will definitely watch again.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|is amazing, this edition is a single disc as opposed to bonus tracks on a seperate one which is awesome.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Looking for a great SCI-Fi show that stretches your brain?  Dr. Who will have you loving each episode and coming back for more.  Warning the first episode is hard to ge through.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Very good DVD for ALL MEN and Boys to see!!  Several churches I have heard have viewed this DVD.  It comes with a high rating.
193700788X|3.0|spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I am so offended by the way this book ended, I did not read it nor I want to. When This book came out, I was so excited,( I am supposed to start reading book no. 7), I thought, I should buy them, and I can read them again. When I saw who she ended up with Sam of all people!! I thought she maybe would end up with Alcide, hell, there's more chemistry between the tiger shapeshifter introduced in book 6 than with sam!! There's a non-relationship between them both, I honestly don't know why she gave the series this ending. She always said she didn't like Eric, and didn't understand w hy people like him, so she made this book, illogical, and decided to make Eric evil, when in books prior to this one, he was good and always cared for Sookie. I would've settled with Bill or Alcide, but with Sam? Sam in the novels is so disgusting! He even had a relationship with Callisto in book 2! I am never buying a charlaine harris book ever again. She doesn't respect her fans , so for that matter, I don't have an ounce of respect for her.<br /><br />June 18, 2013 Update!!!<br /><br />Maybe I was harsh to write the things above. I mean , I haven't read the book, and I don't know how things played out.  I'm reading again the entire series, cuz obviously there's some things I have missed. On the other hand, I was actually surprised to discover that even in book 1, sookie and sam Do have a relationship, it's not a romantic relationship like with Bill, but it's there.  I was actually surprised to discover also, that when the Rattrays wanted to kill sookie sam was the one who saved her, and Bill killed the Rattrays. When I'm finished with the entire series I will give the review that this book deserves.
B00632HWOG|2.0|It is nice to have email stored in the cloud and be accessible everywhere though many devices. Lately it has changed into a product for smartphones and the features required to use it on a PC seem to randomly disappear, stop working, or it grinds to a halt. They have no technical support and have added so many ads that the downloads are slow.
B0000549B0|5.0|My father loved it.  This is one of his favorite movies and a friend borrowed his copy and never returned it to him.  He was very surprised to receive this as a gift to replace the loss.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Had Majong on my iPhone but it strained my eyes so bad that I deleted it. The Kindle version is SO much better and I don't have to stain my eyes to play!! LOVE IT!!!:)
B00AW57L96|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I have only just been introduced to reading again and I am enjoying it.  I really enjoyed this book.  Go Kindle.....I don't have to put on the bed lamp, it's the fifth book I have read in a month after a 25 year absence.  :)
B007R6UWN0|4.0|Initially this series didn't grab me, but since I'd already paid for it, I kept watching. I thought it kept getting better and more interesting. In so many shows of this genre the lead character is irrationally despised and disrespected by the other characters--always misunderstood, always needing to fight all the harder. And that seems to be the case in this show as well, which is a tad irritating because I don't see that there is any reason that he would be so disliked by his former coworkers or anyone else. All that aside, by the time I got to the final show of the season I was searching for the next season--which does not seem to be available as of yet. I will keep looking for it though!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I LOVE BIG BANG THEORY! This show is so funny, I have all the seasons! The DVD came fast, I preordered it as well.
B00122HT04|5.0|I love this band.  I love this album.  I think my favorite song it Almost Easy, but Lost is a great rock out turn up the stereo song.  A little bit of heaven was wierd until I saw the video and then I was like man that song is great too.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|You can work yourself us watching this movie expecting to see something that will scare you. This movie has a decent story (although you really have to suspend your knowledge of geography to make timelines fit) but the effects are lacking. The little kids make the movie but more money should have been spent on effects for the \\"mama\\" over what they probably spent to get a famous name actress.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Love love love! I've already watched the entire season twice since I got it. Definitely a must have for any PLL addict.
B00CDFWJIG|1.0|I had been looking forward to watching this movie despite the previous reviews. With actors like Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson and Viola Davis one would expect it to be good...right? I should have known this dog just wasn't going to hunt. I wish I had not purchased it, but oh well.<br />Adaptations always run the risk of being different. You know that main characters will be condensed (Amma and Marian) or removed all together (the sisters etc.) but it always bothers me when the stories are altered completely. However this could have been tolerated however...<br />The ACCENTS!!! Great Googily Moogily! I have yet to figure out why Hollywood has come to understand that Boston has a different accent than say...New York. That people from New York sound different from people in Maine and that people in Maine will sound different to those in the mid-west. Yet they seem to believe that every single southern state comes dripping with a Scarlett O'Hara style Georgia or Alabama drawl and that is even exaggerated beyond belief! I could listen to the actors listed above, but the younger actors, mainly the actor portraying Ethan, I could not wait to have the movie over so I would not have to hear him talk anymore.<br />So long story short, when you are wishing for the movie to be over you know it wasn't worth the investment paid.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app makes calculating fractions quick and easy. It is a great tool to use for helping daughter with homework and for calculating recipes on the fly! thanks developers
B0002E5O9G|5.0|gave it 5 stars  wonderful performances !! too bad couldn't be there in person  great!!  the songs just stay with you always!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow, this book was a lot of fun! Books with clever premises like this one often fall into flat-character territory or serious cheese. This one does neither. The pop-culture references don't feel strained and the characters and their insecurity about who they are in real life versus who they are in the virtual world are interesting.<br /><br />It's a page turner for sure, and it's got an ending that will leave you grinning ear to ear. Plus, there's a climactic scene involving giant robots.<br /><br />Just go read it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME. THE GAME WORKS FLAWLESSLY ON MY KINDLE. THE GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME. IT'S FUN TO GROW THE CORAL REEF AND LEARN ABOUT THE REEF AND THE CREATURES. THAT LIVE THERE.
0439023513|2.0|Sigh. After two strong books the author gets in over her head. Katniss' personal melodrama gets ratcheted up to eleven. I quickly tired of reading about how she distrusts everyone/blames herself for everything. The 'war' and the last chapters in general seemed very rushed. I will applaud the political outcome of the book, which seems realistic, if not exactly optimistic.<br /><br />There are so many stories about the history and back-story of Panem and its inhabitants that I think would have been much more interesting than Katniss' endless angst. How DID the Hunger Games really arise? How WAS Panem founded? What DID happen to the human race? How close to the edge of survival are we really?<br /><br />We get no answers to these questions and I'm not sure Suzanne Collins had any. Her fictional universe revolves around Katniss, and therein, I think, lies the problem.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The maze-runner series is definitely a great read for fans of books like Maximum Ride. These books offer a completely different view of what is good or evil and help show that sometimes there is no clear line between the two. These books have definitely kept me engrossed with their shocking and still somewhat realistic plots.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the game. OUTSTANDING graphics. Most hints just trough but not so explicit as to spoil the challenge.  Please make the next one longer.<br />Rsuth...
B00708KPR8|5.0|Awesome album its fast, hardcore, and the vocals are just harsh and so awesome the best part of the whole album in my opinion is the drumming its just techniacal and fast its awesome recommend to any fan.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Challenging enough to keep you trying but not so hard you don't see success. Easy to understand controls. Great time filler.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This story of a person's will to survive and gain freedom is a true vision that no mission is impossible. This book will open the eyes of people proving that such camps of torture and death still exist.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is my first time ever playing this game and it is the funnest game ive ever played it would be fun for little kids and ten year olds this is awesome
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I enjoy the plot line, the continuation of a great franchise and the characters are better developed and &#34;likeable&#34; (or &#34;dislikable) than many shows.  Love the series
B007TKT2SK|5.0|A very simple calculator that has a great and intuitive interface for those of us that are not good at fractions.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|A good if somewhat loose interpretation of the Leather Stocking Tales.  The characters are believable and exhibit the basic traits of British Aristocracy and the frontiersmen and women living on the fringes of civilization.  Good although somewhat bloody movie which can be enjoyed by the whole family.  I would recommend that if younger children watch it that they do so with their parents.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I use movies as incentives for Home School students to take home with their lessons as rewards for achievement & word is it's a great movie!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|If you watch a music video full screen, it doesn't look clear.  This could be the app or my Kindle (the new HD) but I'm not sure.  There are a lot of videos to pick from though, which is good.  I haven't found anything better, so I'll keep it for now.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I may not love zombies in general, but this movie was a great adaptation of the novel. Well acted, scripted, and just an overall great watch with a sweet ending. I can watch it over and over again and not get tired of it. It's got a powerful message as well, if you choose to read into it. Highly recommended, slightly twisted but perfect love story. And, by the way, R...Romeo, Julie...Juliet? Just saying.
B00129H7VS|5.0|In the real-world assessment of what motivates soldiers to put their lives at risk, freedom, God and Countryor any other noble expression give way to the reality that they do it for each other.  That is captured in this eloquent presentation in a way that few, if any, other series has captured.
B007TKT2SK|2.0|If you need a fraction calculaor for ONLY VERY SIMPLE CALCULATIONS then this app is okay.  However, there is NO WAY AT ALL to enter decimals or a number such as pi (constants)!  You NEED to be able to enter and use pi in just about ANY calculation regarding circumference!  This makes this calculator good only for linear calculations, which makes it practically useless.  Too bad, it really looked like a nice one.  Maybe if the dev fixes this mistake it will make the app useful, but not until then.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|He vowed, upon receipt, not to proritize anything above watching the whole series.  I felt really good about this selection; because he did!!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Pretty cute.  Somewhat realistic about what to expect when you are expecting as a pregnant woman and an expectant couple.  Funny, surreal and dramatic where necessary.  A good watch.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part. I knew this book wouldn't be a happy ever after fairytale but I feel that the author put so much description in the first 20 chapters and then all of a sudden decided to end it. It would have been nice to hear more about Haymitch or hear what Gale's new job was in District 2 or even how Peeta and Katniss find each other again, instead it is just a \\"so they did and that is the end\\" kind of ending. I am not sure how they are going to make 2 movies out of this book. I hope they put a little more thought into the ending. I was left without feeling closure for these characters. Book 2 by far is the best of the 3. Looking forward to the movie in November.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Characters and their relationships were really hard to keep track of.  Rowling jumps between using nicknames and given names for characters and their relationship to one another isn't clear until at least mid-way through the book.  Lots of hate among characters and the closest thing to a &#34;good guy&#34; in the plot dies at the end!
1475972350|5.0|Think about how often you get frustrated by the little delays in your life, the time queuing, waiting on hold on the phone, waiting for someone to do something they promised you they'd do straight away. What if one day you just flipped? What if one day you refused to accept these delays? This is the premise of Time Killer as a cold and sadistic killer decides to get revenge on the time wasters in his life.<br />It is extremely difficult to get noticed in the crime thriller genre, you only have to look at the television schedule  or the shelves at the supermarket to see how saturated the market is.  As a result, many a great new author will disappear amongst the throng. Time Waster should not be one of these.<br />The first book in the Max Larkin series is a tight thriller as Max and his new partner, Jesse, hunt down a brutal and sadistic killer with a link to Max's own past. A genuinely thrilling read with some great twists and a well realised cast, Time Killer will grip you from the first chapter and won't let go until the satisfying conclusion.<br />Todd M. Thiede will be a writer to watch out for.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Now this was a good movie...as a history buff, I enjoy these adaptions....some things were not quite as they happened, or at least based on a copy of US History written in 1898...but it was still enjoyable. I even watched it a second time with my grandson who happened to be studying the Civil War in school at the time. He really liked it too.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Could not stop playing this game at work...... maybe I will work tomorrow for now gonna keep on playing.... so much fun!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this series. The characters are great and suit each other perfectly. I was hooked after the first show and could not wait for each new episode.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|With enough fighting, shooting, and hovercrafts to keep it tolerable.  Strangely enough I wish part of the chase HAD taken place on Mars.  Chemical wars left earth uninhabitable with the exceptions of Britain and Australia connected by a \\"chunnel\\" train through the earth's core.  Evil tycoons fake a terrorist attack to justify full retaliation against Australia with armed robots.  It looks a little too much like \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Minority Report\\" to get very excited about.
B0026SCMNM|3.0|I guess I was hoping to be immersed in Brooklyn but the story could've taken place most anywhere. Not enough Brooklyn in it to warrant the title. I grew up in Brooklyn so I was expecting the character of the different neighborhoods to be explored. Also did not get the choices the characters made and after awhile didn't care.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I read it every chance I could get. Same as Sophie  Kinsella' s other characters in her other books you can't help falling in love with this twenties girl. The things these girls get into and get out of as well.  Awesome!  I just love how she weaves the tale and brings all the characters together and everything  makes so much sense in the end. Can't wait for more to read from Sophie.
B00CTT9646|4.0|QMx partnered with Hollywood propmaker Kenney's Custom Props, LLC, which redesigned the familiar Starfleet phaser with updated finishes, servo spinner and working power dial. The stunt version of this pistol - which features a manual spinner that uses magnets to lock the barrel into position - will be available as part of an Amazon.com exclusive gift set that includes the 3D Blu-ray Combo Pack this fall. The servo phaser will be available in 2014.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Not a bad read.  I found Kyle's style similar to other SEALs, which is cocky to the nth degree.  I spent time on the other side of Spec Ops, where developing a working relationship with locals is an important and vital part of the job, so the total dismissal of working with indigenous units was irritating after a while.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is an awesome app. It is great if you have a lot of fractions to do,  such as a carpenter.
B004H83IG4|5.0|If there is any character Ryan Gosling cannot play to near perfection I have yet to see it.  Since the death of Robert Durst's mother his life plunged forward into chaos as fast as he could live it and find potholes to fall into.  He is a man and a character that is nearly unfathomable when reading about him.  But not anymore-Ryan Gosling has brought him to life in such a haunting and desperately sad way that you can't get him out of your mind.  His mother, father. wife, best friend and neighbor are all dead now, he has no children and there is noone else who could or ever will tell us what he really did or did not do to any of the departed. The film shows Durst (Ryan Gosling)  meeting and falling in love with Kathy (Kirsten Dunst) who he marries hoping to have a happy rural shopkeeper life in Vermont.  He is, however, the son of a multi-millionaire real estate developer and landlord (Frank Langella) who wants him to grow into taking over the family enterprises.  He is dragged into the family business anyway by a father who is a despot and who cannot get his son to act according to his inheritance.  Kathy is in medical school and when nearing graduation, she disappears and is never seen again-alive or dead.  Robert's best friend, Susan Berman who is suspected of helping Robert cover up the murder of his wife, is perpetually broke and when she puts pressure on Durst for money, she is killed with a bullet to the back of her head in her own home.  That murder has never been solved either.  With the D.A. and police sniffing around the old murder case, Robert escapes to Galveston where he rents a room as a mute woman, complete with a blonde wig.  His neighbor is killed, dismembered and thrown in several bags into Galveston Bay.  When the remains wash up on the beaches, Durst is arrested and tried for the neighbor's murder.  He convinces the jury that he acted in self-defense and is only convicted of improperly disposing of a body.  As I said earlier, pothole after pothole yet still he now lives in Florida after serving a short term for the disposal of the body.  There are enough twists and turns for anyone who  loves a who-dun-it and Gosling plays the mute woman with aplomb and apparently no worries that his performance would be so hard to watch.  As the film closes, he is humming a song to himself in the elevator as he walks away from one life and into another.
B005LN5UOC|3.0|This headset does not fit ear really welll, and also you can only use it on right ear!. But for the price its OK.  .
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|It tells a story that has not been told much in series programs. I really enjoy it, and would recommend Iit for people who like historical dramas.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the book, reading part 2 now and looking forward to read what's in store for Ana and Mr. Grey.
B00B69UQJY|3.0|Sounds like DM is trying to keep up with younger bands and put in what sounds like a dub-step edge to some songs.  I found much of the music lacks rhythm and flow.  I'm going to see them in Chicago in August and I'm still looking forward to it!
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|The book was good, and the movie was just as amazing. Logan Lerman is the perfect actor to pick for the roll of Charlie!
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|Not quite as good as WFTSC, but still some good songs.  I agree with other reviewers that some of the songs seem to be fillers and lack the flow I'm used to, but there's still some good music here.
B006M4F67A|4.0|love majohng and this one has variety.  have not played it a lot yet but it is relaxing and enjoying.
B000H30B2C|5.0|My grandchidren played this so much in my suv that it became damaged so I had to replace it.  I found this on Amazon and they're back into it again.  My grand kids are older so hopefully I will not have to purchase another one, but if I do, I know where to look.  Thanks Amazon for great finds and prices

B00005NP04|5.0|Martina Mcbride was introduced at a CMT awards presentation as \\"one of the greatest voices ever created by God.\\" While debatable that her voice may be the result of divine creation, her high octane soprano is one of the most beautiful and powerful in music. She has become an iconic figure and a lock as a future member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. Her latest release, \\"Eleven\\" is her most personal to date. Most everything about the record is unorthodox starting with its launch via train tour. Twenty years into her career, she severed ties with the long time label and management that brought her superstar status and with which she has garnered multiple awards and 24 Top 10 singles.<br /><br />In many ways, she is a study in contradiction.<br />Hardly an imposing physical presence at 5'2\\", she generates decibel levels that challenge the structural integrity any venue.<br /><br />McBride's full voice retains its understated silkiness even when she goes supersonic, most notably on perennial showstopper \\"A Broken Wing\\" It is a performance that won't just give you goose bumps, it will change your blood chemistry. Her classic beauty combined with Joan Jett sass make for a cross between demure songstress and sexy rocker. Her youthful exuberance and charisma belie her 45 years.<br /><br />She has made a career recording songs that empower women like the peppy \\"This One's for the Girls\\" but her signature; \\"Independence Day\\" is more somber and deals with domestic abuse.<br /><br />Additionally, she has been country music's most-played female artist of the past 11 years with more than $18 million in album sales.<br /><br />Parents need not worry about her being a role model. If you ran a background check, all you would find is a halo. She has been married for over 20 years with three loving daughters. She lit the Empire State building pink in honor of breast cancer awareness and one of her tour sponsors was Sunny Delight.  Radio stations of various formats have included her rendition of the national anthem in their playlists. Few have a resume squeakier clean than that.<br /><br />With the crop of country artists currently charting, the line separating pop from country is more blurry than ever.  This angers some industry purists. She sees her colleagues' crossover stardom as a positive. Though she plays down the extent to which her talent has impacted the country music landscape, she is a master of the craft and has set the bar for the upcoming generation.<br /><br />She discussed everything from her new role as a songwriter to Smokey Robinson's admiration for her talent in this recent interview.<br /><br />VISIT: [...]laylists.

B0096HL33G|5.0|did not expect it to be so engrossing and entertaining - absolutely realistic and surprising- very believable to- may have to watch again
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I'm good with fractions, but as the joke goes &quot;5 out of 4 people have trouble with fractions.&quot; This app is perfect for anyone that needs to do math with factions.<br /><br />Pros: Very easy to use, and always shows the lowest  fraction (2/8 = 1/4 for example).<br /><br />Cons: I wish it had a decimal to fraction converter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun for the whole family.  Lots of great games in this app, some challenging and some easy but all are fun to play.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I loved this book; makes me want to join SEALS! Chris Kyle is definitely an American hero and legend! Great read!
B004GYY714|5.0|Living here on the east coast and on this island I call Da Cape!! Getting any radio stations is hard at best :-( However, this product does provide local stations and better reception than I can get with a real radio :-) Bravo! and thanks for a great app!! Works on every item I use, phone, computer, and now my new Kindle Fire HD :-)<br />Hope you enjoy as much as I do :-)
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Handy Fraction Calculator that is Easy to use.  Results are shown in Whole Number with Fractions and also displayed as DECIMAL Form in parentheses above the Fraction result at same time.  The Display and Virtual Touchpad Graphics are excellent and have a pleasant 3D look to them.  Input is easy with separate FRACTION touchpads for Numerator (above) and Denominator (below).<br /><br />All the Math functions work well but it is missing a very important feature that most calculators have;  A MEMORY function to allow saving and adding to saved fugures.  This would allow more versatility and usefulness.  There is plenty of room for the additional keys so it is surprising to see that it is missing this feature.  Overall, it is a very Nice and Helpful app though.  Worth the cost.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not really into the Facebook scene, just like to look and write once in a while :-) It works very well and I'm sure it is what it is :-) I'm glad at time as it lets me get some good ideas for writing :-) I'm sure most people spend much more time on it than me and I hope it is worthwhile for you :-)
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this movie.  I am not really drawn to what I feel will be poignant tear-jerkers (as life can be fraught with enough hardship and pain), but I liked this one.  I imagine that it is always hard to keep a story about such a tough subject (cancer) from becoming maudlin and drowning the audience in sorrow, but this had, along with its solid core of real, down-to-earth bonds of friendship between the four men, some genuinely funny moments.  The end was kind of what I expected, and I did cry, but I was glad that the main character was able to do what he did on his own terms.  I'm not good at reviews, but I hope this encourages people to watch the movie.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game on my Kindle Fire!  Nothing like swinging through the city fighting crime to fill a few minutes of down time!  I would recommend this game to any Spider-Man fan!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|My son loves this app! It is a great help for me to check his homework and an even bigger help for me figuring out the correct amount of wood I need for my wood working projects. And best of all was the price!

B006LSZECO|2.0|I was so disappointed with the ending. I am a slow reader any way, so the end just sucked. The whole time I was reading I thought what a great movie it would be. Then when she went back to Nick, I changed my mind. It took a weird turn. I like conclusions. This one left me hanging but not in a good way. I don't care about any of these characters.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Love thus. Sto good. Watch it now. You will love it. I will watch it with you. You will love that too
B00000AFWW|5.0|At first I was concerned because it sounded nothing like the Hole I love...it was too happy lol, but after listening to it as a whole album, I loved it! Its amazing and with songs like Reasons to be beautiful & Use once and destroy, you can tell Hole still had their edge :)

1433524708|4.0|It's the Bible first and foremost!  I would have given the rating 5 stars however the shipment did not include the code to access ESV Online Study Tool.  I contacted Amazon Support and they redirected me to Crossway and they were able to provide the access code.  All in all: great quality binding and leather, pages are very smooth and easy to read.  Simply a ton of study tools and notes within the Bible to help get a deeper understanding.  Great Bible and happy with my purchase :)
B005LAIIJY|1.0|This is one of the most crude and down right stupid movies I have ever set through.  It starts out in a bad way and goes downhill from there.  I would classify this as Jamie Fox's worst movie.  He is an excellent actor and this movie does not show that.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is so much fun! The levels are so creative and fun to accomplish! The free play is so enjoyable and you can let your imagination get wild! At first I thought 99 cents? Probably not worth it, I should probably get a different game that's 99 cents like  Cut the Rope. But then amazon offered everyone that had a kindle 500 game coins, and I thought why not? So I gave it a shot and it was definitely worth it! The graphics were amazing, straight up HD! With this game you can let your imagination go wild, and create vampires, colorful sea-monsters, or even giant dinosaurs! This game is also great for the kids, because they can describe the items using adjectives, which will improve their grammar. Be sure to get this game you won't regret buying this awesome 99 cents game!

B00AQLGXTU|4.0|I did enjoyed reading this book.  America's inability to choose between Maxon and Aspen did annoy me and I wish that she would hurry up and make a decision already, however I am looking forward to finding out more about the rebels as there has to more to them than what we have already seen and I am also looking forward to seeing what happens with the selection and America.  Will America finally decide who shes in love with more?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie did not disappoint me.  True, I did not expect much, but even so I was pleasantly surprised.  It was hard to suspend disbelief, because the main premise, that a future government forced children to participate in annual games to the death, is pretty much unbelievable.  But once I got past that, the movie seemed to work.  The acting was great, the dialogue sounded right, and the response to the various dangers seemed consistent.  Positive values were compassion, courage, and resourcefulness.  Unfortunately there is no hint of a Supreme Being, no faith, no spiritual aspect at all.  But it serves to warn us of the sheer evil that a totally secular regime is capable of (not that we need it, after the repeated horrors of the 20th century).  It was sad to see the heroine crying like a person who has no hope -- apparently she has no faith, and no hope.  But we see that kind of despair around us every day, among those who have not yet come to faith in Christ.
0525478817|5.0|This was an easy read, and enjoyable for anyone looking for an alternative approach to a cancer story.  Quick witted and a little bit sad, but a nice story overall.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Wonderful game. Only problem is everything is too expensive. If a little cheaper would be a lot better. Also you have to buy a lot of extras. But overall a fun game & enjoy playing very much.
1574214276|5.0|for my collection!! This is one of my FAVORITES- I found this book is very informational with 101 tangle examples and instructions from the many wonderful artists of Zentangle related books and blogs. It also has a lot of great inspirational examples, suggestions and projects !!! I feel this is a 'MUST HAVE&#34; for anyone who loves to doodle and create &#34;one stroke at a time&#34;!! - for both beginners and experienced doodlers!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|Rented this video for streaming.  No audio.  Kept getting error message - no audio.  Went to Amazon's website to try to report the problem and get a refund.  Spent more than 30 minutes trying to find a way to report the problem and get my money back.  Amazon has intentionally buried any place where one might get one's money back.  This is really shady.  Use other on=line services whenever possible.
B00008OE4W|5.0|This is a great movie. Fun and funny. Good twists and turns in the plot.<br />A not too intense spy show!
0316010669|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I got it from the library, and liked it so much I bought this copy for my son and husband to read. As a psychologist, I have a great interest in how the brain works, and how we tap into various aspects of ourselves. I learned a great deal from it and found it fascinating. I was especially impressed with the research in unconscious racism, and how we can &#34;reprogram&#34; ourselves.

Jazz from Chicago, talk shows from New York, sports from anywhere your team plays called by the local sportscasters.  Go for it!

B003ZJ23XU|5.0|I love this movie, and it is perfect for me to use on my kindle. I love to watch it
B0059A149C|5.0|The depiction of the Memphis Belle story will leave you with a real sense of patriotic can do ability when under duress. Well acted and good family picture. 5 star rating because they just don't make movies that much anymore like this. I felt like I was right in the plane with them in the final scenes when all the chips were down and they were doing everything they could to bring her in on a wing and a prayer. Great World War 2 action drama with good natured military humor and team drive to accomplish the objective at hand.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A good game with a decent amount of content. Easy to get money and isn't too hard to control. 5/5
B009VSW15Y|1.0|SO MAD at this application it's useless defective..the pictures are poor quality and as soon as you try to run camcorder the app crashes
B007MDB71O|4.0|Like many older folk here, I was exposed to the original Burroughs series.  I did not expect this movie to be a carbon copy - what film is?  I expected to judge it on its own merits, and in this it succeeds well enough.  The period costuming is impeccable, the characterization adequately deep for a pulp fiction hero, the critters \\"authentic\\" enough.  There are necessary updates, of course: Burroughs could not have envisioned such electronic flying machines, and the chivalrous Southron of the original Carter would have come across as mere hokum to a modern audience, inviting more cynicism than honor. Lynn Collins is modernistically \\"correct\\" as an amazon princess; her scenes are worth watching for obvious reasons.  Altogether, good entertainment.  Why this should have \\"bombed\\" at the BO, as opposed to long-playing silliness not worth the ticket price, is one of those market mysteries whose secret may be revealed, some day, beyond the River Iss.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Awesome cool no boring very no so good very bad book that'll not put you to sleep at all so get it
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|Note, I just reviewed the [[ASIN:B00BSN0K3U Jor-el]] figure from this series and noted that of the series, I think the Jor-El figure probably comes closest to looking like the actor that is playing in the movie.  The Superman figure being reviewed here, well, it just doesn't seem to match as closely back to the images that have been shown in the trailers that we've seen for the film.  I don't know if that is due to having a different artist do the various sculpts for the masters for these or what, I'm just noting that they don't look as close to the actors that we see in the trailers as some might expect.<br /><br />Note, none of the 3 figures in this particular series are intended as toys. These are, instead, intended to be collectible figures for adults (big boys and their toys). While these figures could be played with as a toy, collectors would likely shed some tears as they think of these collectible figures being \\"ruined\\" by having been opened and played with.  As a toy for youngsters, these figures would probably not last very long. They aren't that fragile, but they are not the kind of figure that would hold up to the kind of use and abuse that a youngster might put it through (thinking, as an example, the throwing of the figure across the room at a little brother, older brother, cousin, sister or other relative when a youngster decides to throw a tantrum ;-) )<br /><br />Retail pricing in stores is supposed to be in the mid teen range, though these are apparently collectible enough at this point to make some of these figures more expensive than that suggested list pricing.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Just saw this is in theater and I thought it was awesome.  The movie itself was loaded with action and the attention to details was awesome.  (Example:  In the beginning when the Enterprise lifts out of the water, the detail in the way the water comes up around it.)<br /><br />The movie begins on the planet Niburu, where Jim breaks Starfleet regulations and gets busted back home.  Of course, Jim Kirk never stays busted for long.  Without telling you any spoilers, things escalate and we have the good guy-bad guy across-the-galaxy chase thing (as you expect).<br /><br />If you can, catch this on the big screen, because the 3D jumps right off the screen in this movie.  It is one of those movies you just can't get up from your seat on --I know I sure couldn't. WELL worth the price of the movie ticket and well worth owning.

B0053FANQS|5.0|hello,<br />  being fans of the fast and furious series, this one Fast & Furious (2009) does not detract from the storylines.  spoiler alert...rebels rebel, bad guys chase, good rebels win in the end.  it fits into the series well.  perennial bad guy in everything, john ortiz, adds a little zing to this story.  the action does not rest and the chase is just as good as the others, but it may be the best so far.  hard to beat the train and car scene, but it is exciting.  the characters play well and the action does not stop.  you will not be disappointed...  yrmv
1476712042|4.0|the co-dependency plot is an interesting twist. I mean in a way when you are in a relationship you tend to depend somehow in your partner.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|Wonderful cinematography & direction.  Not for the viewer who wants their action fast & furious though.  The whole opening scene was a study in facial expression.  Good story.  Great acting.  Loved it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A well written book. Very explanatory and informative about the after life. I love that Dr. Alexander went all the way in proving that heaven truly exists.I wish he had explain more about the &#34;other worlds&#34; and &#34;other beings&#34;. It left me wanting to know what exactly did he mean? I believe in other worlds with living beings and in extraterrestrials properly in some way or manner in charge of what happens on Earth and even in charge of us. I am a practicing Christian and truly and wholly believe in my heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus Christ and of course in the Holy Word of God ---The Bible, but do we know everything? Is there more? That is way I wish that Dr. Alexander would have gone more deeper into &#34;other worlds&#34; and &#34;other beings&#34;. I loved the book! I would  recommend it that all read it. As a matter of fact, that's just what i did to some of my friends. Thank  you Dr. Alexander. Write another book explaining what those other worlds and other beings are.
1400052181|3.0|I living in a town with a high school named for Henrietta I was really curious to learn more about who she was and how she became so important to the medical world.  It's an amazing story. I was most amazed to find out that it was kept secret for so long.<br />  All that being said, the writing style, not my cup of tea. Had the story not been as interesting I may not have made it through.
B007L6VR12|4.0|This movie isn't for the prom queens or the popular kids.  It's for the real people out there who see a little bit of themselves in these kids.  Loved it.
0385737955|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition! This book is so fascinating and so hard to put down! It took a while to get into it (the first couple of chapters were confusing and therefore boring) but once you really get into it, you can't put it down! Be sure to have the second one close at hand for when you finish this one! It's a great book! If you liked the Hunger Games or the Divergent Trilogy, you will love this one!
B00A7W29BE|1.0|I thought this app would be a nice help in scanning paper documents. I was wrong. I find it is almost impossible to use without seeing the item I wish to scan. The single front facing camera in the kindle fire makes using this app difficult at best. You cannot see  what your doing and more often than not the image is off center or cutting part of the item off just hopeless. Save your money just use a digital camera to scan your paper documents. It works better than this app.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got the game for the grandkids,  It was to hard for me but the kids like it very much.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|The storyline was very weak and the acting seemed forced. The dialogue was lame and unrealistic.  By the end of the movie, you get the actual premise and you realize all the more how disappointing the movie was because so much more could have been done with it.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Just what I needed. Allows me to prop up the unit while using while protecting it while not in use or carrying around.

B00COGXGNQ|4.0|We were at the exciting part - the last 30 minutes - and the movie got stuck!  It said loading;  went to the same spot;  stopped and said loading again.  It did it over and over, again and again.  Very disappointing!

B0055PGUYU|5.0|From the opening anecdote to the detailed notes at the end, The Power of Habit was an amazing read.  The anecdotal &#34;story&#34; technique kept me reading evening in the more technical parts of the book.  Everyone has habits, and The Power of Habit details how they are established, their importance, and how they can be manipulated by others and ourselves.  I recommend this book to everyone!

B003JTHWJQ|2.0|I had previously read Richard Dawkins book 'The Magic of Reality' and found it readable, that along with having seen an interview on TV peaked my interest. I bought this book hoping to support my fairly recent change of philosophy to Atheism. I found the book to be boring to the extreme with excessive name dropping and between the lines intelectual snobery. Had I not already become an atheist based upon my own rationalization and life expreience with religion this book would have done little or nothing to convince me that I was making an informed choice. The intolerence of the author for others that have a different belief than his reeked of English intelectual snobery which I found to be very distasteful to the extreme. I would not recommend this book to anyone that might be considering giving up an established religion or belief. I also question a number of his statistics regarding American religious beliefs and the rigidity of their doctrines comparing them to members of the Taliban. Overall the book was in retrospect a very uninteresting read.
0545405777|5.0|The best book<br />I really love it, is the most beautiful book in my collection.<br />Now I waiting for The Catching Fire Collector's Edition.
B008W31IFS|5.0|THE REVERSAL by Michael Connelly is one his best. The story is centered around the retrial of a 24-year-old murder of a 12-year-old girl. Jason Jessup was convicted of the murder at the time and spent the last 24 years in prison. However, due to the introduction of newly discovered DNA evidence that did not match Jessup, he was ordered released. The Los Angeles District Attorney directed that Jessup be retried for the crime. Mickey Haller, long-time defense attorney, was picked by the DA to represent the prosecution for the State. Haller's ex-wife, an experienced criminal prosecutor for the County of Los Angeles, was named 2nd-chair. Harry Bosch was named lead investigator. The professional and family connections of the three quickly become entangled and lead to emotional and spirited disagreements. The prosecution team often appears on the verge of self-destruction. Unlike many courtroom dramas, Connelly has made this one interesting through a balance of explanatory narration by the combative lawyers and a flurry of give-and-take dialogue. The reader is placed in a front row seat for the courtroom drama and immersed into the ebb and flow of the fierce emotional dramatizations. The final chapters are gut-wrenching with Harry Bosch playing a prime role. The only criticism I have of the novel is that Connelly (as always) drops the ball in the final paragraphs. His characters disappear into the wind. I give The Reversal 5-stars and recommend it as one of Connelly's best.

B009Y2KGSQ|4.0|Review number 301. Have to say that 'Music From Another Dimension' is better than what I had initially expected. Tunes here that definitely impressed me the most were \\"LUV XXX\\", the gut-felt \\"Beautiful\\" the ass-kicking \\"Out Go The Lights\\" and \\"Legendary Child\\" [especially this track] possesses that certain -classic Aerosmith vibe-. But, this CD has a total of fifteen tracks - thus there is so much more to experience with 'Music From Another Dimension'. Also liked the inspiring \\"Street Jesus\\", \\"Lover Alot\\" and \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" - which I thought was similar to to \\"Angel\\" the over-played (at one time) video on Mtv. As luck would have it, I wound up going to catch Aerosmith not too long ago on their 'Global Warming Tour' with the beloved Cheap Trick as support and my ticket was in front row, dead center. I ask you - does it get better than that? A nice find.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|This has a pretty smart story and is acted 2/3 well. Certainly worth a rental. Maybe Marky-Mark's best acting job yet. He's fairly compelling in this one. Great cast.

0670026603|5.0|Not my usual genre but was recommended by friends.  Subject matter very difficult to deal with for me.  I found the story well written and insightful.  I came away with a greater understanding of &#34;relationships&#34; and continued appreciation for good health and being whole.<br /><br />JoJo Moyes has a talent for making the reader &#34;experience&#34; the life of her main characters.  Highly recommend this novel.

B003F3NDP8|3.0|It's not easy deciding when it's time to leave a show that you've been involved in for several years. But after watching the sixth season of Desperate Housewives on DVD, which I think didn't live up to the potential that was there in its first seasons, I just think it's time for me to leave the Lane. For after seeing the downhill quality in term of plotlines and writing, I just don't want to buy the last two seasons of a tragicomedy-satire I think should have been finished since its fourth season instead of becoming this daytime soap opera.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the actors. They all did the best job with what they got, even Teri whose storylines became dull after the first season and made me think that Susan should have been the one to die from Zachary's gun in the Second Season Premiere. But as Marc Cherry became more interested in delegating his writing to other people while organising TV pilots (the failed Hallelujah and the upcoming Devious Maids) or a mini-series called Another Housewife, An uninspiring, ridiculous and self-satisfied cell phone plug, I just think Desperate Housewives became a joke with rehashed storylines. For once again, we have Housewives cheating their husbands with other men, secret children, people trying to bribe their neighbors to escape their frustrating lives, a mystery, and of course a big tragedy happening in the middle of the season. Now as for the tragedy episode, it worked well when it was the Supermarket shooting or the Tornado, but as for the plane landing on the street, I felt this was over the top and made me wonder what would happen in the next seasons. Would we have aliens, zombies, Mecha Streisand (wait they did it in South Park)? Because by the time we get to the fifth season, we find out that this accident episode becomes a plot device to get rid of dangerous or secondary characters that have no more use in the show, and to bring bigger ratings.<br /><br />As for the two mysteries in this season, I found them the only things that made the show worth watching. But of them, I found the Bolen, which was good, to be too separated from the other Housewives lives and I think it should have been instead an original series rather than a \\"one season\\" mystery. As for the mysterious strangler, I thought it was all right, but it should have been finished at the middle of the season instead of the final episode. And as for other Housewives storylines, Bree's were probably the most terrible as she has to deal with an adultery relationship that looked too much like a conventional soap opera, and a second one involving Bree's new employee whose situation is too similar to Kayla and becomes a plot device to reintroduce a first season plot line that should have been dealt seasons ago: Andrew running over Juanita Solis in season 1. Not only that, I think it should have been Orson Hodge who should have had the chance to act more viciously rather than some character who only appears in this season. As for Lynette, her baby storyline that only happened in the awful \\"If\\" episode should have been instead a major plotline for the rest of her show since it would have allowed her to see her life turn into a new perspective and make her grow.<br /><br />On another point, I think the main problem the show had is that the Housewives' lives became separated and dull compared to the mysteries that secondary characters always got to do. To me, what made Mary Alice's mystery worked so well was that the Housewives were involved in her life and so there was the possibility that they could have witnessed something that they never got to see before. Personnally, I think it would have been great if that show's mystery had opened a Pandora Box that would have revealed dangerous secrets in the Housewives' lives that would have become the main focus in the seasons, that almost everybody would have found out, and that it would have brought forth consequences as major to them as to what Mary Alice had to live.<br /><br />But unfortunately, it didn't happen. And so, I have come to see a show go from a clever tragicomedy-satire on suburbia to a dull complacent, and self-satisfied, day-time soap opera. Of which I don't want to invest myself anymore.<br /><br />It was good while it lasted but for me...<br /><br />So long Wisteria Lane.But unfortunately, it didn't happen.

B00CJ1C7UO|4.0|It really grows on you like all Amorphis. I think that they were just stepping back a little and embracing some of the earlier, heavier side. It is an awesome album.

0345803485|5.0|I first read 50 Shades due to two things: 1) It was everywhere and I was tired of feeling like I was living under a rock, and 2) I was really bored at work with nothing to do.<br /><br />Honestly, I think E.L. James put crack into this book. To this day I can't explain it. But I totally read this book and the others in a single weekend. It was a sickness. Because, it's not like it's extremely well-written. (I also don't think it's complete trash either like some have said. Believe me, I have read complete trash coughWhyRomeoHatesJuliettecough.) It's not even like I'm sex-obsessed. Really, I don't read erotica. I tend to be annoyed with the repetitive sex scenes; I like balance. And, I typically can't stand melodrama and angst. (Which is why I couldn't with Twilight. I wanted Bella to stab herself hard.)<br /><br />But ef me, I like Ana. (Admittedly, she wears on my nerves in the other books.) I love her inner struggles. I heart her inner goddess and her conscience. I love Christian Grey and how mysterious and sexy he is. I love that the book is completely ridiculous and addictive. I have read ridiculous books with ridiculous situations before, and they made my eyes bleed. So really, I have no idea what E. L. James did right with this book and series, but oh E. L. James, never stop.<br /><br />Plus, the e-mail exchanges between Ana and Chrisitan are like gold. Lets not even get into the contract he wants her to sign. I died, I tell you. I died. It was so glorious; I had to read it to the girls at work (which was an experience in itself I tell you. There we are, all nodding along in agreement. \\"Don't defecate on me.\\" Okay, I get you. I can agree with that. \\"Don't set me on fire.\\" Right on. \\"Don't choke the hell out of me.\\" Three of us nod in agreement and one goes, \\"What's wrong with that?\\") In fact, I tried to get everyone to read this. Not only that, but when the movie comes out I am there. I'd spend my last $10 to see this.<br /><br />So, if you love glorious hot messes then this series is what is up!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I love this movie, it is one of my new faves. We have a short list of awesome kids flicks and wreck it Ralph is one of them.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Watch the hobbit walk, watch the dwarfs misbehave, watch stuff that wasn't in the book.  This movie goes on and on.  How they could ruin this great story is hard to believe.  Don't waste your time.

B007OLYQ4E|1.0|Wish I could give this ebook a good review - but it just doesn't hold up. I love Truman Capote - but it strays so far from what I remember the story to be. Love &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; but not Breakfast at Tiffany's.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|The app is great for what it says it does - creating background noise to fill in the silence. However, it's a little bit unstable in that if it's interrupted, it is difficult to get it running again. Otherwise it's a great app.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|The book was good, but they made such a big deal about the movie that I guess my expectations for the book were set a little high.  Good read and good story.  I havent seen the movie yet as I was waiting to read the book first.
1451695195|2.0|I didn't find this very interesting. The author seemed very focused on his own personal opinions and how he was a skeptic because of his background. There are plenty of non-doctors who are skeptical about these things and he seemed oblivious to the fact that it's not just doctors who feel skeptical. He didn't really go into what he actually experienced. He only briefly touched upon it. He spent more time talking about superficial things like his being adopted. It seemed more like an autobiography at the time so it was getting boring at that point. He could have made it shorter or give the book more substance. I found him to be a little arrogant and self important as well in his writing. He seemed to think his illness was so rare and that his experience made him so special especially since he was a doctor.<br /><br />I also wondered how accurate his book was since he tended to write about what his family was experiencing like he was there but clearly he wasn't since he was in the spiritual world while in his coma. It probably would have helped if he wrote that he had people help him put together this perspective of the book. I personally didn't like it because I knew it was inaccurate and felt if he wanted to gain credibility, writing from a perspective he actually never experienced is not a wise thing to do. I'm sure there are better and more enlightening books on this subject.<br /><br />If you want to read it, get a library copy like mine. Not worth buying
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I know this movie isn't as good as Casino Royale but I still enjoyed it. Especially when his rage comes to the surface. At the end of the movie...the one lady is in it that is in the show &#34;Castle&#34;.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|This film is wonderful, it gives an accurate insight into the era and life at sea. We live such an easy, protected life now days - compared to what the sailors on this ship faced. The Darwin inspired Botanist is great character and lets the mind wander to those earlier days of since and discovery. The soundtrack is superior, the cello and violin segments are so moving - the final sequence so perfectly done.<br /><br />Russell Crowe in oustanding, no more so when giveing Hollum's eulogy;<br /><br />The simple truth is, not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be. But we are all God's creatures.

B007REV4T8|4.0|In my opinion, this is the best of the Daniel Craig Bond movies. I still like Sean Connery as Bond, but in this installment of the series, we see the gritty, hard hitting Craig break new ground. We see the brokenness of Bond, but also the tenacity and the triumph.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like Daniel Craig as 007.  This is the Bond as Ian Fleming intended. Edgy & feeling!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well written,heartfelt story. Christina McKenna reminds me of Flannery O\\"Connor's works. Well done. I cannot wait to read more of this author's work.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love the game. Could play it all day. Have told all my family and friends about it thanks very much.really over the top
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are few books in this world that can grip you and change your life, even if just for a moment.  This is one of those books.  I became engrossed in this story, and fell in love with the characters.  This is a book worth reading, especially if you have ever experienced loving someone with cancer.  Moving and lovely story.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|7 years was way too long to wait, but this album is incredible!  Only Justin can pull off the tracks on this album.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is so fun and adicting and me and my brother did it together and we don't do anything together it is so fun I love this game and I think u should get it to
B00915G6WQ|4.0|What can we say about Dexter, that everyone doesn't already know. He's creepy, but somehow we continue to love him. The 7th season doesn't disappoint.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've never considered myself a \\"trekkie\\" or \\"trekker.\\"  See, I'm not even sure what the correct word is.  Having said that, I've seen almost all of the original episodes that were on TV as well as \\"Next Generation\\" and a few of the others that followed.  I've also seen all of the movies...in theaters and at home on Blu ray.  But I'm no expert on this series or any other.<br /><br />What I've always liked about Star Trek is the humanity, humor and honor Gene Roddenberry instilled in the franchise.  Director extraordinaire J. J. Abrams has managed to maintain that character in this his second time at the helm.  He also brings to the table a credible cast that manages to retrieve the original characters personalities while adding their own individuality.<br /><br />In an action filled opening sequence, the Enterprise crew is on an exploratory mission when they decide to intervene in the evolution of a remote planet, and its primitive inhabitants, on the verge of destruction from a large volcano.  This is in violation of The Federation's code and James Kirk (Chris Pine) is relieved of his command as a result.<br /><br />The appearance of a terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch in a chewy role) returns Kirk and crew to chase him to forbidden Klingon territory.  Zachary Quinto returns as Spock in yet another good performance of the Vulcan science officer and second in command.  \\"Into Darkness\\" borrows some important plot points from past episodes that I won't give away here.  What is important is that this may exceed even the Star Trek reboot from 2009 in terms of action and suspense.  We know all the characters now, so we can concentrate on villains, collisions, space battles and fist fights.  And Abrams is a master.<br /><br />I saw this theatrical production on a large IMAX print in 3D and it equals \\"Avatar\\" in terms of production quality.  I never noticed any departure from the large print but here is some information I found on Kodak's website regarding the film:<br /><br />\\"(Dan) Mindel upped the ante further by shooting about 40% of Star Trek Into Darkness in the huge 15-perf IMAX format, which captures a negative image nearly 10 times the area of a standard 35mm frame. Almost the entire story that unfolds outside the Enterprise spaceship was shot with IMAX cameras, usually mounted on Technocranes to facilitate movement. Some scenes were also shot 65mm 8-perf. In using the IMAX format on a narrative feature, Mindel and Abrams were following a trail blazed by Christopher Nolan and Wally Pfister, ASC, BSC on The Dark Knight. In fact, Mindel and Abrams consulted with Nolan and Pfister, who encouraged them to go for it.\\"<br /><br />That's what I say, go for it.the film:<br /><br />\\"(Dan) Mindel upped the ante further by shooting about 40% of Star Trek Into Darkness in the huge 15-perf IMAX format, which captures a negative image nearly 10 times the area of a standard 35mm frame.

1881273377|4.0|A lot of what the contents say or basic information I think most people should know, but then, a lot of people don't realize that we are all basically wanting the same things in life.  Especially helpful for men and women under 40.
0446572985|5.0|All of his books are really engaging.  They are interesting and have good plot lines.  This one is supremely satisfying! I loved it!!
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I have not downloaded a single app or video or whatever yet this game says it needs me to delete 144 Mb of data to work. Then after I deleted Pandora and stuff it says it still needs 144 Mb. WTF.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is the best movie EVER!!!! my husband and i have had it on repeat for about two weeks straight now! Funny as hell and great music!!! LOVES IT!!!
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Very interesting music peoples, most likely you will love the beats, the trippiness and all the freshness it brings along
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|Kinda a let down but i still love them tons. Love the stories in the songs. They are now grown and not so rockerish
1408215330|4.0|Very helpful dictionary has everything I need like the phonetics sounds and syllabic separation. The CD is very good as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|&#34;Hopeless&#34; was by far one of the best books I've ever read. From the very first page I loved the book. For the first 100 or so pages I thought it was going to be an ordinary love story...which there is nothing wrong with that! However, all of a sudden there was a twist followed by another turn, and that was followed by yet another twist to the story. I couldn't put this book down. I read it in two days (could have easily read it in one if I didn't have to go work!). This was the first book I read by Colleen Hoover, but I just purchased &#34;Slammed.&#34; If &#34;Hopeless&#34; is any indication of what a great author Colleen Hoover is, then I'm sure she will be my new favorite author...sorry Nicholas Sparks!
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|The movie was perfect, one of my all time favorites. Received it promptly, as I said, this was a great buy
B001NIA27E|5.0|My 6yo son absolutely loves this movie. We watch it at least once a week. I saw it years ago when it first came out. It's still fun and Pierce Brosnan is nice to look at. ;)
B000256TD0|5.0|What an incredible collectible piece. A modern hot wheels you could say from an acclaimed classic movie such as back to the future. This one is my favorite edition of the delorean so that's why I bought it
B007TNS6JI|4.0|like the game but you do need to buy gold and gems to progress quickly however you do get nice plus exp on each gear you upgrade that addes to total exp earned over all fun but i woild rather have add supported free game
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|In depth analysis without the drama of the cable networks and Main Stream Media outlets. Solid business news combined with an unbiased view of the world events. This is a must for the serious business student.  Bloomberg delivers the business news like the Wall Street Journal used to do only BETTER.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|I expected this to be much funnier than it actually was. The storyline wasn't that great, but I got a couple laughs in.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Up to date forecasts and current weather anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world all on you Kindle
B004U52VPS|1.0|Parents, check the sellers for this item closely.  If you see folks citing knock-off versions, best skip those sellers.  We got a counterfeit version, and while it's functional, I feel pretty ripped off.<br /><br />My rating is really driven by the product delivered to me, not the actual toy.  We waited nearly a month for the game to be delivered.  I actually had to go to the post office to have it released since the customs form required my attention.  Customs form?  Yep, shipped straight from Taiwan.  If it had been the actual game, I might be less bothered, but it was clearly (VERY CLEARLY) a knock-off of less than top-quality.  Nonetheless, it was functional, and the kids were chomping at the bit for it so its a keeper.<br /><br />We've got other versions in the series and they're all about the same.  If your kids are determined to play it by the rules, be prepared to help the younger ones.  It's REALLY hard to build some of these structures without a deep reservoir of patience.  It's often just as hard to actually hit the thing with the birds. Between the different birds and the varied performance of the launcher, I was challenged to say the least.  In the end, it's an OK toy.  overpriced, but OK.
1476734941|1.0|I was already in diet mode but had reached a plateau so I was hoping this would jump start me. it did nothing after following it for one month. perhaps it is meant for someone who has not already been successfully dieting. t was easy to do the diet and I felt good on it...just zero results.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|As they sometimes say, I certainly didn't see THAT coming!  The story line in PINE just did not let up and kept me reading almost without break.  The author's comments reference the old TV show TWIN PEAKS, which I didn't watch and now wish I had if it's anywhere near as good as this book.  Everything starts out looking pretty much like a routine crime investigation that falls into disarray due to a traffic accident.  Things start to get strange but, still, this stuff COULD be related to criminal activity on a major level.  Then you start to think you're caught in a CHILDREN OF THE CORN replay.  WRONG!  At the end I couldn't help wondering, &#34;What would I have done?  What would I do?  And what is going to happen next?&#34;  Read it and, if you aren't totally hooked by the third chapter, you aren't paying attention.  Just READ IT!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is just smart! While I know perfectly well how to input fractions into a regular calculator, it will always translate it into a decimal. If you need the answer to be a fraction, you are back to converting it again. This is an elegantly designed easy to sidestep that problem. Bravo!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The story is a tad on the complex side since the main character wakes up with a blank memory every morning.  Just as she does, you have a certain impression of the other two main characters but develop, just as she does, a nagging feeling that something just isn't quite right with one, or maybe both, of them.  I can't say the ending totally surprised me since it was one of two or three possibilities I was considering, but it is sort of a shocker anyway.  There's just a slow building of tension as the story moves on.  Really a good book.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|the only reason i give it 4 stars is because of the graphics, the voice acting and the riot shoeld guys... otherwise its an awesome game
B009NY43NY|1.0|So disappointed ! Loved the series, but this book jumped the shark at the get go. I wished I had never read it. As a reader of this series long before True Blood , I didn't want a happy ending, but this just tossing in characters from the past just to fill up the book. SHAME! SHAME!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|It was funny and entertaining, well worth the $4.99 rental fee. Barbra Streisand does a great job playing the part of the annoying mother.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I love this book. It started slowly, but once you get the characters straight it becomes fascinating. I'm going to read it again in case I missed anything in the first few chapters.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game has moderately difficult hidden object and mini games. The hint button recharges fairly quickly. Note some items are listed by their British names. Some objects have more obscure names ev. grimoire and codex.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched the first 2 seasons on another &#34;instant play&#34; program, and became quickly addicted...to the point that I completed all 3 seasons in one week while sick. Excellent!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This film will make you laugh and cry.  It will make your heart sing.  It was beautifully written and directed, and full of unexpected<br />pleasures.  I'm so glad that I discovered it.  I recommend it to everybody.
B00AZ3027I|4.0|This is a classic movie, and somehow my kids have never seen it!  Thankfully, now they have! Peter Pan, wahoo!  (Coz, ya know, a movie about a guy sneaking into a young girls bedroom is one EVERY kid should see! rofl) [totally joking!]
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|iron man three is a mixture of temple run and fruit ninja but is uniqe in its own way.I recommend this game. you do have to be patient prepareing internal storage.may seem hard for kids 10 and under.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Well thought out, Well just enough to keep you going but not too hard with the hint help. Well done!!!!
B00009RAJH|4.0|Excellent sound quality - great songs. Fleetwood Mac at the very top of their game. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It was a free game on the marketplace, but in order to really compete you would have to spend some serious cash.  While it is fun to play, the free armor and regular level upgrades are too slow unless you purchase upgrades with the cash in the game which costs real money to have enough to be competitive.<br />The graphics are nice and the game place is smooth so it is still a fun game to play, however once you reach a certain point you would need to spend money to advance further.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|This was quite an interesting, quirky read.<br /><br />A mystery and black comedy set in a middle class Savannah, Georgia neighborhood. I'd describe it as a cozy with nothing too graphic, but a page turning plot involving several characters and POVs. The author handles the transitions skilfully.<br /><br />Some of the coincidences that occur in this novel stretch the credibility a bit, but hey it's fiction.<br /><br />Much like Desperate Housewives, this middle class community is a cover for all kinds of secrets, lies, infidelities and even murder among its well manicured lawns. There are a few minor editing issues with the book, but nothing too serious to harm enjoyment of the story. I would suggest the author get an editor to fix up the problems, it would then be a 5-star book instead of 4.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed it and would read more by this author.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book for review purposes.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I truly loved this game. Great fun, I haven't played an HO game in years &amp; it was a pleasure to find one that is fun &amp;compelling. The graphics &amp; audio created a wonderful atmosphere to go with the puzzles. I Easily would have given 5. Stars, were it not for a few problems.<br /><br />1. Graphics were dark enough for a guy with pretty good vision. I had to turn off auto brightness in order to get things bright enough to see all the stuff on the screen.<br />2. The controls were a little sluggish  when using my 8.9 Kindle Fire HD with 32 GB, so I don't think space was an issue.<br />3. There were times I would get stuck in the game and no new clues were forthcoming. This was difficult for me, since I have not allowed myself the time to play such a game in years. However, when I would exit the game and start at the same place the next day, new clues would appear! These would be clues that I had fooled around for maybe an hour, hoping to find a new clue on the previous day. HEY! I get it, I'm an old man who hasn't bothered with games in years and many others did not need any clues at all!<br /><br />So, ahead a lovely fun game that just needed to be a little more responsive to get 5 stars from  me. I would definitely give it 4.5 stars, even with the very few things that took away from the real pleasure of playing it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So great to have it available in the cloud to watch whenever I want.  Love streaming video.  Also, very cheap.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really like the book.  It was fun to read and even though I was hesitant about reading it, but I could not stop myself once I started.
0316187216|5.0|Abercrobmie has a unique style of writing that is dark and gritty, but also enthralling. I have loved all of his novels, and Red Country was no exception. The new characters are well fleshed out, and the old characters fit right in. I'm sad that I've run out of things to read by him.<br /><br />Definitely don't start with this book if you're new to Abercrobmie. Start with The First Law trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The author is good and captivated me.  At first I was hesitant about reading the book, but it was very good.  I'm always up for sappy love stories.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I've been a long time thinker and supporter of women's [and mens] issues. This served as a nice lit review of the current status of gender equality and was validating to hear that many others encounter similar struggles. It was simple and deliberate. I feel it offered optimism and hope when too often tackling these issues can lead to pessimism and becoming jaded.  I appreciated the concept and do hope this is the beginning of a larger conversation.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and always find it emotionally stirring and absorbing.  This is wartime as it must have been to those who fought it while knowing that it was hopeless.
0756405890|5.0|By ANDREW (AJ) MARKUS<br />An engrossing tale of innocence and promise turned to tragedy, The Name of the Wind blends a detailed fantasy world with a highly realistic plot. The characters are what make this such an enticing book. As events transpired, questions arose and left me unable to put this book down. I thoroughly enjoyed this tale and would recommend it to all lovers of fantasy.
1594481717|5.0|Pink is entertaining while detailing the transition our culture is making from the tech era to the conceptual era, where employment will center on retaining a workforce by giving them a sense of meaning in their jobs and encouraging them to be imaginative and innovative, by hearing the stories that our clients and staff have and connecting them to our goals through these stories.  Good luck!
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|I like it very much<br />Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it.
030758836X|4.0|I love it when a suspense novel does a 180 - everything becomes different and the tension increases.  This is skillfully done with this novel.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Sorry I wasted my time on this one but then I never put a book down once started...very disappointed unlike others.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark does not disappoint in this book.  With twists, turns and the unknown, she keeps you guessing till the very end.  I look forward to her next mystery novel.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Terrific writing and character development. Was a fast read just to see what was going to happen to these characters next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story,the characters,the world they inhabit was so well developed.  I really enjoy a book that transports me into the storytellers world and this book did just.  I was hooked from the beginning until the last sentence.  Look forward to reading the next book.
B00081912E|4.0|If you love Jim Carey, this is for you. A fun story for kids and adults alike. The more grown up humor will go over kids heads. Nice mix of fantasy, animation and a good moral to the story
B005FISBTO|4.0|I have no idea why I love this series!  he is a blood splatter analyst with Miami PD and his sister is the trash-mouthed but very effective Homocide Lt.  She catches the bad guys but if the justice system doesn't properly deal with them, he re-catches and kills them.  There is no reason for this to have become so addictive, but somehow it did.  There were some terrible twists to the story in last year's season and I am concerned about how they will tie up the storylines...but I just can't stop watching!<br />Now, about the DVDs themselves:  I took the set to a friend's house so he could see what I have been talking about.  Neither of the first 2 (out of 4) would play on his machine.  DVD #3 did play, though, and he says he understands my fascination with the series.<br />I brought them home with me, thinking I would have to return at least the ones that wouldn't play - but decided to test them at home and they worked perfectly.  So, I guess the moral of the story is that not all DVD players are equal.<br />If you have never seen the show, I would recommend you watch it at least once (it's on Showtime, Netfix, and probably Hulu) to see how you can like a serial killer!!
1563523302|4.0|It is basically as I expected.  I am looking to glean some wisdom if only a little from the research that was done to derive the data the book is written about.  Thus far, through chapter three, I've already had several interesting conversations with other people about what I've read.
1400069289|5.0|Helps understand how to create good habits and break bad ones.  Appeals both to me as a teacher and as a coach.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked 101+31 games because you really can't get bored there is tons of different games its like a never ending arcade
0345472322|4.0|Helps one understand why some students do well and can deal with failure while others cannot.  Lots of stories andcomparison but a bit lacking in how to achieve the change in mindset.
B004XUMMFE|1.0|Trued to watch this through my PS3 connected to my wireless router. Sound cut out for about one minute partway through.  This happened to episodes 2,3, an 4.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Excellent calculator.  I especially like the print out feature.  Buttons are big and easy to use.<br />Highly recommend if you are looking for a calculator.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|I have played this game for 2, 3 and 4 players. This game is perfect for a family who loves to get together and play. The playing time is no more than 1 hour and depending on the personality of those playing it delivers a lot of fun.<br /><br />It is also perfect as a filler game during parties with gamer friends and I have found it gets even funnier when player with more people.<br /><br />It is cleverly designed and very creative, its presentation ressembles that of a manga book or anime series, and the art of the garden tiles is beautiful.<br /><br />The most amazing added value are the 2 miniatures for the gardener and the little panda which are carefully hand painted. Just amazing!
B007F7QG0Y|5.0|Keith is amazing -- and, somehow, his memory is too! A very entertaining and surprisingly well-written autobiography. Very colorful, full of unknown, funny bits, and very well paced. I couldn't put this book down.
1878424319|5.0|Don Miguel is a brilliant yet simple man who walks in two (perhaps three)<br />worlds. Anyone who intends to better their life and the world they live in will<br />benefit from this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a really interesting game with lots of little things like prizes and puzzles. I think its a fun free game.
B008C20TDG|4.0|My husband & I just completed our very first Whole30 thanks to this book, and he lost 28 pounds and I am down 10 pounds and some inches.  This book is very thorough and has a &#34;tough love&#34; approach to it.  It gives it to you straight!  I have to admit, some of the chapters were boring because I am clueless about triglycerides and HDL and aminos and all that health verbage, but I know some health savvy people will love that about this book.  The first week and a half are hard, but it gets SO much easier after that!  We've adopted this way of eating as a lifestyle & are so happy we did.  We feel so much better!  I highly recommend this book!
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|If there is ever been a &#34;dysfunctional&#34; family, this is it, but what a great story, especially based on real characters and history. Truth is always stranger than fiction, and here is a prime showcase of that!
0765325950|5.0|One of the best books of the best books of the entire series. Great way to end everything. Very satisfied.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Orphan Black is an thrill! Love the storyline and the twists and turns, especially the versatile acting!<br />Highly recommend watching it
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It works as well as the desktop version, so if you are used to the desktop version this will be fine for you.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm reading and rereading this book because it is brilliant. It gives a social critique as well as creating a post apocalyptic world that you can believe in. I'm a bibliophile and this is the best book I've read all year! Even better than the survival guide!!!
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend this book for any and everyone. I tried the free version first and feel in LOVE with the book and i was not disappointed when i bought the full version. My only negative is that i wish the story was longer! =)
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Castle will be a favourite in reading entertainment as well as tv. Love all the characters and story lines. Will be starting the next book soon<br />.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally frustrating game but really addictive, you need really fast fingers and think really fast. Can't wait for t he next version too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing. When I first got this game I thought it would be like the last one. NOPE!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Quirky but loveable characters- I was rooting for them throughout the novel.  A good read and makes you appreciate the good time.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It gets the job done. Also nice that it keeps time as well. Plus all the different types of sounds to set alarms to.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Granddaughter loved the game; she was able to figure out the system and played for at least 1 1/2 hours.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Just a simple and plain app. Very easy to use, without having to decipher complicated buttons on a high end calculator.  Great for simple fractions and more complicated fractions. I love it.
B0059A149C|5.0|I love this movie!! Great scenes with the B-17. I had the honor of seeing and touring the Memphis Belle.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I used six of the nine energy experiments, and every one of them worked well within the 48 hour time period, four of them within the hour.
1591840562|5.0|I thought the book contained candid and practical advice when considering starting a business or seeking financing/capital.  I will keep this book on the shelf and refer back to it.  The author has a way of being to the point and entertaining.  It helps to watch some clips of him on you tube to get the humor beind the writing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great, super smart writing. Couldn't put it down. Filled with quality sentences. Interesting characters. Very inadequate, disappointing ending. What a let down.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I like shows set in this time frame. This show is clean, family oriented, and well scripted. The acting is not bad either.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not what I expected but it was entertaining. The book really wasn't much of a story just a lot of short sex scenes.
193700788X|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book coming out.  Fortunately, I have a coworker who purchases the hardcovers of the books as soon as they are released.  I was a late arrival into the books of Sookie Stackhouse.  But from the moment I read book one, I was hooked.  I went out and purchased the entire set and inhaled them in just a couple of weeks.<br /><br />Anxiously awaiting to see what the final turn was going to be for my friends on Bon Temps, I grabbed this as soon as it arrived and started reading.<br /><br />Shame on you Charlaine Harris.  We readers totally understand that this is NOT the television series.  We understand that you may be tired of the supes who have so generously lined your pockets. But this book seems like an afterthought.  Like \\"Oh well, let me just get this over with so I can move onto something else.\\" I hated how you ended the book.  The writing was terrible.  The way you turned our most kick your ass vamp into a wimp.  I just don't get it.<br /><br />I was so irked by this all, that I took my entire collection right down to Good Will and just left the bag there without even getting a receipt. I don't even want people to know that these books came from me.  I won't even sell them on EBAY like so many others have -- at less than a dollar a book!<br /><br />I am so over you.  I will never spend another dollar of my money or minute of my time reading anything you have written.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was so excited to finish this book and the ending is absolutely horrible. Very disappointing!  It could've ended so much better, so much more exciting but instead if just ends on such an odd note. Very anticlimactic.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|Compared to other Duet CDs.. eg. Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, did not enjoy as much. Did not seem to have the pizzaz as his live concerts.

B00B22IJXK|1.0|Forced into download an entire load of other crap, and after having done so, still have yet to be able to download and install this.  Useless customer phishing.  (I suppose that review should be for the tools that run Amazon and not the app, as I still cant use fricken blasted icehole crapper.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I was just going to buy one song from the cd. I gave it a quick preview and realized there were several additional songs on the cd that I really liked. It was also a good price, so I bought the whole cd instead of just the single. I've listened to the entire cd now and it's really good.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book is a combination of sweet and romantic with a little bit of mystery and heart break. I love the twist on the prince meets his princess story, sometimes slightly appalled at the idea of love being a game and women being the pieces.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Ok, so far in 2013 we have had overly hyped (OZ: The Great and Powerful), dissapointing (Iron Man 3) movies.I am relieved to say this isn't one of them. You don't even have to know anything about Star Trek to love this movie.
0385347774|4.0|Good read, but didn't like the ending.  Was interesting 'til like the last chapter, then it was as if the writer was in a rush to get it to press and just finished with an easy, quick ending.  Could have ended so much better.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is very fun. It gets harder and harder every time even little kids like my brother love it!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|\\"Star Trek\\" has come a long way since first airing on the NBC network in 1966. No other franchise has such a following of fans that span so many years. Those same fans like their \\"Star Trek\\" star-trekkie and don't like deviation. So when J.J. Abrams took over the movie franchise almost exactly 4-years ago, there was excitement and hesitation. Abrams not only revitalized the series that had presumably died, but he went back to the beginning to characters originally fleshed out by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, George Takei and Walter Koenig. He started over. On top of that, due to events in the 2009 movie, he wiped everything that ever happened with these characters in any episode or movie clean; as if it never happened.<br /><br />\\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" is a combination of new ideas and classic stories. Abrams is making a point of doing new things and going new places, but at the same time being nostalgic with those trekkies that like their \\"Star Trek\\" more than their first born. The actors, especially Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock), are all perfectly cast. Pine delivers that classic Captain Kirk charm, charisma, wit and cockiness. Quinto is so good at Spock even the trekkies don't complain.<br /><br />\\"Into Darkness\\" is less about establishing a connection with fans than having some fun. Not to say that Abrams didn't make a considered effort to connect with longtime fans, but after his first movie managed to slip by with wide spread approval, he has taken the gloves off and let the action fly. From the opening moments of the film until the closing credits, the movie is constantly interesting, action-packed and intelligent. A summer blockbuster has to do that, right? Yet, Abrams also delivers with emotional impact and a theme that resonates throughout the film about leadership and friendship.<br /><br />There is a popular assessment of the history of \\"Star Trek\\" films that only the even numbered releases were worth watching. Abrams in my opinion has finally broken that trend because both of his movies deliver. The future of the \\"Star Trek\\" film franchise may once again be a tough one to read though. With Abrams also taking on the future \\"Star Wars\\" films, it makes you wonder if \\"Star Trek\\" will suffer. For now though, we have \\"Into Darkness\\" and it is exactly what you pay money for at the movies; a film that delivers on all levels of excitement and emotion.<br /><br />Bottom line though, the original cast of this amazing series should be extremely proud. Not only did they lay the groundwork for a series that has spanned almost 50 years but the actors in the current movies are playing them; recreating them. That doesn't always happen when movies are remade. Yet, these current actors are paying homage to a cast of actors who couldn't have possibly known what they were starting in 1966.eases were worth watching.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I liked it, I liked the action (especially when it was about the plane), but what I did not like is Denzel Washington mouth &#34;bad&#34; habit in this movie. It was just not right to do that with his mouth all the time, I was like &#34;wtf is wrong with that guy?!&#34;. It's a good movie overall but I expected more from Denzel.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe reader allows me to read my documents quickly and easily.  It is the best thing I have yet seen.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics and wonderful game play. Great mystery storyline. Solving the puzzles gives a sense of great accomplishment. Loved it!
B0008ENICU|4.0|This is an absolutely fabulous movie - a must for any serious movie lover's collection. While its ideas are a bit dated (surprisingly, even disappointingly, unfeminist for something that was written by a woman) it's nevertheless funny and biting and in many ways spot-on. The characterizations of the women's competitive, backbiting \\"friendships\\" are hilarious. The film itself deserves five stars. Unfortunately, the audio transfer on the 2002 Keepcase Edition is utterly haphazard. Hold onto your remotes if you buy this version, as you'll be fiddling with the volume control the entire time you're watching.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Not my favorite movie - but interesting to say the least. Hate that at the time it was only available by purchase instead of rental. I spent a lot of money to watch a movie once. Good idea if you plan to watch something numerous times though. Wish I had been given the option of viewing and then they would send a hard copy DVD when available with purchase.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Just buy it for crying out loud.<br /><br />If you don't completely love it, return it to the store and tell them I said it was OK.<br /><br />Then write, &#34;I am an idiot&#34; on your forehead and walk around like that for the rest of your life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a fantastic game to play and is very realistic. The graphics are great and are detailed. This is also a great game because it allows thoughs horse lovers who want to own a horse, finally get their wish.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This was a great book even on the second read.<br />Would highly recommend it. To all my friends and family
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed the twists and turns - I felt pulled into the story and felt empathy for both main characters.  I wanted to keep reading when the last page was turned.... could there please be a sequel?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this is a nice game. The senery is well detailed but i wish the charactors are not limited. The only problem i have with the app is the adds for other apps. Its sooo annoying! Other than that its a good app.
B008OOYALE|4.0|it looks just like dragon vale. I have been playing it for a wile. so I think I might like this game
B005O30Y5Y|4.0|a lot better than part 1, very well done and iam sure to be finished i hope you do not ask me for any more reviews but i can practice my typing skills which aresorely lacking
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Warning! Spoiler ahead!<br /><br />When my friend treated me to this movie, I thought \\"My goodness!  It's going to be another bad horror movie\\". It turned out I was completely wrong.<br /><br />- There is some characters' depth. For example, the touching scene where one sister tried to pull the other one from their mother's hands. The question was \\"Should you go with your mother to the world of the dead or stay in the living world?\\"<br /><br />- There are some terrifying moments too.  For example, the scene at the beginning, in the abandoned house did scare me.<br /><br />- The acting is good enough to be convincing and enjoyable.<br /><br />- The plot is not too illogical as others of its kind.<br /><br />- According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production budget was $15 million.<br />Its domestic gross was $71,628,180. Its foreign gross was $73,200,000. So, the worldwide gross was $144,828,180. Its profit was 9 times more than its cost! That's a huge amount. It's popular both in North America and overseas.<br /><br />In short, it is certainly worth watching. It's different than most of other horror films.
B00B22MJSG|5.0|Anyone who grew up in the 70's and 80's is famously aware of Fleetwood Mac. Those who write music today have listened to them. I just love their style
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app!! it works so good I us this app so much.  I use this when to wake up in the morning I love this app:)
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is so freaking funny. I love it will all my heart. There has not been anything I haven't liked about it. Teddy West Side is adorable and Marshall and Lily are such a perfect couple for each other. Robin is kick-ass. Barney is. . .well. . .Barney. There is no other way to describe him. Neil Patrick Harris is an awesome actor and I love how he plays this role. I would recommend this show to anyone who loves comedy where nothing is off limits. They joke about everything. The jokes range from stupid silly to semi-adult. If you like ridiculous comedy and love triangles this show is the best!
B008RJFRTK|5.0|I am a new Android user and wanted offline maps because I travel a lot and want access to offline maps, particularly in Asia.  Yes, Google maps are great, no one denies that.  But somtimes I am travelling in Asia and dont always have connection to my home data network and using very expensive roaming data useage just to have the convenience of using a map on my phone is cost prohibitive.  If I want to navigate around a city, I have three options:  1) expensive online maps (because of phone charges), 2)inexpensive offline maps, and 3)inexpensive paper maps from the local tourist bureau office.  I choose option # 2.<br /><br />I downloaded the primary world map with no problem.  After I downloaded the China map, every time I would try to zoom in to see the detailed street maps, the whole app would close and would not re-open.  I sent an email to customer service about the problem and they literally responded to me in 10 minutes.  They first had me uninstall the China map and then try to re-install.  After that did not work, they had me uninstall the whole app and sent me an entirely new app file through email dropbox.  After I loaded that new map file, the maps worked perfectly and I was very very satisfied with the product.<br /><br />As a new Android user and with offline maps being very important, I could have been very frustrated and just thrown the $5 away.  Hey, why not?  Its only $5.  But MapsWithMe had very good and very responsive customer service which quite frankly surprised me, considering this is only a $5 product and they already had my money with no returns.  But their customer service was very responsive, helpful, and the process to load the new maps was not difficult, even for a new novice Android user just switching from a 5 year old Nokia phone.<br /><br />Product:  4 stars.  Customer Service:  + 1 star.  Total:  5 Stars!<br /><br />Phone used:  HTC The One (2013)
B003L77FYS|5.0|what is there not to like about this DVD.. Castle is such a great show and love to watch  them over and over
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read this book so any times andd i still cry , every single time when i read. I think this is a book that everybody should at read lest once...
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Can't get this on my TV so i order it and now i can watch it any time i want to
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Adam Sandler rarely makes a bad movie.  This was a great kids movie, and funny for adults too.  My 5 year old watches this movie on repeat.  Very funny!
B00CTT9646|5.0|So this is a great deal for a new look on an old show/movies. Any Trekkie that understands that this is an alternative time (think mirror mirror where Spock looks like a pirate), will love this. Though some things won't work you have to love how its being new fans in. Just think of this Star Trek movie and the one before as a new story. Don't compare old with new it just won't work. Also this gift deal comes with a phaser, which just is even better!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is fun as hell. and u have to play it it is so fun. I give a 5 out 5.
1933308087|5.0|Jenny knows her stuff, from  technique, to history, to color,  to so much more. So many patterns to choose from. Makes it impossible to choose,but we do because of the love of quilting. My life may not be as her's, but the thrill of getting a great quilt out of the process of my own choices of block, design, fabric color and placement. I know it is what I was born to do. Plus I am a MOM so you know our life is full. LOL AMY
B0033G9NT2|3.0|There are plenty of amazing reviews on how amazing this album is. So I'll just focus on this 2 piece vinyl set for the review. And sadly, its the worst Priest vinyl release I own. Heres the deal. Even though these were not printed until 2010, it is still the god awful Jon Astley remaster from 2001. Not the 2010 Japanese remasters. You'll get all the bass in the world from it, too much actually.<br /><br />Problem is, the highs clip, very very badly. Just search google for 'Bad Judas Priest Remastering' and you'll see his name everywhere. Its extemely sad really. Every other previous 1990 Priest vinyl I have is the originals, and not the so called 'remasters.' Going on youtube and watching the comparison of 'Bloodstone' from Screaming for Vengeance, its unlistenable on high end audio equipment. Now think of the original 90' Painkiller release. Real punchy sound, with very controlled highs. Jon Astley apparently wanted to inject some 3khz+ love on this, and went overboard with it. I can live with rediculous 60hz toned up bass, as its an easy to fix problem.<br /><br />So in short, I'm still looking for either an original painkiller vinyl, or even better the 2010 Japanese Remaster version, which is MUCH closer to the original. That'll be a pretty penny. I personally would stay away from this. I mean, if you don't care THAT much about sound quality, you might be alright with it. First person that wants to trade the original Vinyl for this, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Sadly, I paid 50$ for this, and the much better import of the 2010 Japanese Remaster was only 15$ on cd. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you absolutely have to have the easiest way to get a vinyl of it.
076421120X|5.0|There is something wonderful about this devotional! Not only is it beautiful (the hardcover edition is so gorgeous I can hardly stop looking at it!) but the challenges and inspiration and teachings that readers will glean from its pages are priceless. I love that this is a 365 DEVO, so you have something every day! I love that they are not too long, but not too short... It's just the right balance to get you in Gods Word, praying, thinking & letting the Holy Spirit do His thang! Each month has a sort of theme & that is just cool! Because all month that 1 principle or truth is permeating in your mind & heart! Darlene Zschech has long been a source of pulling me into the presence of God with her music, and now this devotional...what more can I say! Get it. These would make beautiful gifts for any occasion;)
B005PK57IK|4.0|The casting is spot on and the acting is pretty good. Some of the episodic plot lines are a little goofy. But, the continuing story lines are well done.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Only sad that this is the last in the series! Sookie Stackhouse has been a wonderful series to read and I will miss them.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is one of the best sets of superhero movies ever. It was a little excessive in being destructive. But, it was fun and the acting was good.
0670023329|3.0|his story was most interesting, tho the author spent too much time writing about his thoughts and ideas. Basicly a good book, to read and pass on to others
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|I'm not sure it's their best work but it's a very solid effort. I have been listening to it nonstop for a few days now.
B009R659L8|4.0|This book keeps you glued to the end with stories that link together people in innumerable ways.  The plot twists with several murders and centers around a factory fire involving a furniture restoration company. Excellent reading.
B0097K21YW|1.0|I don't know what to say about this game.  I did not enjoy it in any way shape or form.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Definitely appreciated the not so subtle themes presented on top of it being a good story.  Cool answer for why zombies eat brains too!  Highly recommend it.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I didn't really find this interesting enough to give it a thorough try.  I might give it another try later.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I liked this movie because of the quirky characters. I am concerned that it is bordering on child porn though. I was slightly weirded out by some scenes but the innocence of the characters pulled me through .  I was surprised a little bit by this movie . I recommend it.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I haven't explored this game enough yet but what I have played I like it a lot.  I want to see what is available head to head before I make any further comments but the AI game is very good.
B0078ZTWP4|1.0|It didn't work . Installed to different set of batteries in it. I couldn't get it to light up. Checked the polarity of batteries and they were  installed correctly.I returned the item.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This show has a little something for everybody - sci-fi fans, western fans, comedy fans, action fans. One thing is certain above all else, though: it will make everyone who watches it a Nathan Fillion fan. Not that there's a poorly cast member on the crew. Adam Baldwin steals the scene on multiple occasions, and Jewel Staite as \\"Kaylee,\\" the cute and sometimes naive wrench jockey ... be still my heart.<br /><br />As for the Blu-Rays themselves, they look and sound great. And unlike how Fox Network chose to originally air them, the episodes are properly ordered on the discs so you can watch the the story unfold as was intended.<br /><br />If you've never seen this show, do yourself a favor and buy this set. If you're already a fan of Nathan Fillion in ABC's \\"Castle,\\" you may be even more pleasantly surprised after watching Firefly, as there are several tongue-in-cheek references to \\"Firefly\\" in episodes of \\"Castle\\" that only fans of both shows will pick up on.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a game that is fun in the beginning, but becomes repetitive quickly.  It seems the same screen scrolls through as you continue to get faster and better (obviously as you are playing the same screen).  It is great for my grandkids and fun for me for a while.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|This DVD was very very good and this is awful that you must [ut words that you do not have nefore submitting
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Zombies! My second favorite horror creatures. The series thus far have been very good marked with superb acting and as well as special effects. On the down side, at times the episodes drag a little bit and are somewhat repetitive. But the series makes it up for its minor flaws with a gutsy, no-one is spared of a tragic end, plot. Is this the absolute champion of the zombie movies? No, by any stretch of the imagination, however it does deliver a continued pace of viewer engagement that I find quite attractive. Ah, and no mixture of comedy/horror is included here... Solid good.
B009X01C64|5.0|Keeps your Kindle safe has a nice set-up so you can set it up to watch something free standing. Pretty cool.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|While understanding that the amount of material that needed to be covered in one movie is monumental, the movie is oftentimes slow paced and a bit redundant. I gave it three stars for the fact that it is not a low budget movie (and you can tell), and because of the recurrent casting of many of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy actors.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the prespective from the servants side and that we get their stories as well as the family.  Each episode holds so much, but it never drags on.  When the credits roll the story is well wrapped up, but it feels like only a few minutes since I sat down to watch.  I wish there were more episides per season, but this is usual with an English production.  Dr. Who is the same.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There is nothing about Downton Abbey that I have not liked. All the characters are credible which helps tremendously to cast the webs of intrigue, passion, loyalty, social stigmas and tragedy that makes this wonderful series come alive. The locations, scenography and costumes are gorgeous as well as the vintage vehicles are. Highly recommend.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this book during a family trip. I downloaded the ebook into my iPhone and even with the unbelievably small screen I could not put it down and finished the book in no time
B008Q0D32S|5.0|This has to be one of the all time greats, IMO, in western movie history.  I now see why my elders looked up to these remarkable actors.  Bravo Mr. Leone.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie then read the book. There was, as with any book made into the movie, much more detail but what I was not expecting was just how much more graphic the book was and it caught me off guard. But this added to your disdain towards the antagonists
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Always a great read. The characters become real and exist in your mind. You will be addicted to the end. Domo arigato Clavell-san.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator and recommend it highly. It is full screen and is simple to use, and the best part of all is that it is free.
0375869026|5.0|What a great book! Such a meaningful idea, plot and show. I found the story very relevant, and the characters so real. Could feel Auggie 's ordeals, and brought back memories of my own life in school, when kids can just be so very very mean. Loved the supporting characters, especially the mom. Very neat how several prominent players had their own say in different chapters of the book. Already have started to recommend this book to friends.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|As with all the Lord of the Ring movies it had some humor and some exciting scenes. I just really enjoy this type of  movie. So I am glad I purchased it.
B0093LINVK|4.0|I wanted to replace my parent's (and in-law's) computer with something modern.  They were using very old computers with Windows XP, and were complaining about the slow speeds.  They aren't computer savvy, nor do they do a lot with their existing computers, so I thought this was the perfect solution for them.  I really wanted to get the Core i5 or i7 version, but I couldn't wait any longer because I'm flying out to meet them.  I'm not looking forward to explaining these devices to TSA.<br /><br />I bought 2 NUCs, both with the exact same hardware:<br />- Crucial m4 256GB mSATA<br />- Crucial 16GB (2 x 8G)<br />- Belkin 6ft AC cord<br />- AmazonBasics 2-Pack, High-Speed HDMI Cables<br /><br />My total cost was $1109 for both, including the NUCs, or about $555 / NUC.  The 256GB and 16GB is overkill for my parents...but I bought the components as if I was building for myself.  Plus, I'm hoping these will last them 5-10 years.<br /><br />The initial install was very easy.  It took about 10 minutes to unscrew, install the components, and screw the chassis back together again.  Maybe less.<br /><br />Installation of Windows 7 was super quick too.  It only took between 5-10 minutes from a flash drive.  The updates, however, took about 2 hours (still very quick compared to HDD), and the NUC got very warm to the touch.  It also got audibly louder, but not annoying or \\"very loud\\".<br /><br />So, here's what I noticed:<br />- I didn't appreciate that I had to buy an AC cord.  I'd rather have a cord than the gimmicky Intel sound when you open the box.<br />- The NUC had an old BIOS version, so I updated it.<br />- The fan control in the BIOS was set to CUSTOM.  I set it to BALANCED, which lowered the CPU temperature threshold before the fan went faster, by a few degrees C.  I was surprised that the threshold was set so high, something like 77C.<br />- On bootup, the fan rotates at ~3K RPM, which I thought was very high, since I'm used to 600-1200 RPMs.  But then, these are tinyfans, so I guess that's normal.<br />- I also told BIOS to use the maximum amount of RAM it wanted for the integrated video, since there was a lot of memory available.<br />- The network driver, and 2-3 other drivers, had to be installed from the Intel site.  I had hoped that Windows 7 would automatically install them for me.<br />- After everything was patched and setup (with Office and other necessary software), Windows 7 boots to desktop in about 15 seconds.<br /><br />I'm also setting them up with dual 27\\" monitors at 1920x1080 resolution.  I hope it's easier on their eyes.  1920x1200 on a 24\\" or 2560x1600 on a 30\\" would be too tiny for them.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Movie was pretty good...we thougt it was funny and a touching story at the same time...good movie, not great but good

B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Excellent movie, couple of cheesie parts but not many at all...great movie...some big time mind twisters that is for sure.
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|This album is unbelievably great.... i think everybody already knows how awesome disintegration is, i just have to add that this DOUBLE LP version is one of the best things I've ever heard.. the fact that they let the album &#34;breath&#34; through two LP's is a good idea that should be done with lots of albums.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|If you are a woman who has been in an abusive relationship this movie might get to you at times but if you can handle watching little bits and pieces of the Katies memories this movie will leave you feeling great at the end....Julianne Hough did an amazing acting job in this movie and her costar....omg what a hottie! Watched it two nights in a row by myself, the first night the abuse parts got to me a bit as I am a survivor of domestic violence...second night I was ok and then the third night I got hubby and fifteen yr old son to watch it and they really liked it as well....Highly reccomend this movie...amazing story and a twist at the very end will leave you in happy tears!
0375851569|5.0|And really enjoys these books they are bright and fun to read. I believe the brightness and the pages really keep his attention. Which is not easy to do at 2.
B00493E1GI|3.0|i ordered and watched it..decent movie...julia roberts did a good job..just the movie to me was kind of flat, good but not great
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Hi everybody! I highly recommend this movie, especially to Christoph Waltz fans. His character - Doctor King Schultz - is amazingly complicated. Besides, there are great soundtracks ))
B000TS99NW|5.0|I had seen it years ago matter fact own it on vhs, but we don't have a vcr anymore and hubby had never seen it...inspiring movie, feel good movie....one of those movies you watch and it sticks with you...we love it

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am just back from the theater watching 'Star Trek Into Darkness' and I think that one word describes this movie - amazing.  I have seen many negative reviews, saying this movie was cliched, had too many special effects, and was too much of a knockoff on earlier plots.  To all of those who have seen this movie and didn't think it was wonderful I can say only one thing - you are not a true Star Trek fan.  I have been watching the show for close to 40 years and found this movie to be among the best of all the movies ever done in this series.<br /><br />First of all, let's get some things out there.  The special effects were excellent.  The sound quality and music was phenomenal.  While I was concerned that there might be too much action in this movie, in reality I felt it fit very nicely into the plot and didn't overwhelm the movie.<br /><br />The acting was great.  The characters who played the classic character parts from the 2009 movie all were stellar in their roles in this movie.  Some highlights included:<br /><br />- a welcome expansion of Uhura's role in this movie (when you see her you will be happy she is on our side!!)<br /><br />- the continued crotchetiness of McCoy, including one of his \\"I'm a doctor, not a....\\" comments<br /><br />- another very humorous rendition of Scotty, including several classic comments<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch was chilling as John Harrison (Khan), although I'm not sure he 'looked' the part of Khan,  given the incredible job that Ricardo Montalban did with this character in both the original \\"Space Seed\\" and in \\"Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan\\".  There were many other excellent performances, including the actors who played Admiral Pike, Admiral Marcus and Dr. Carol Marcus.<br /><br />Now to the plot.  It was an ingenious reboot of the entire Khan space opera.  It took elements of the original episode and the movie and incorporated them into a new take on one of the best story concepts in the entire Star Trek franchise.  It also reminded one of the episodes from Star Trek : Enterprise where the Augments were first described.  The plot was very reminiscent of many things, including the entire Khan story, the notion of a senior Starfleet officer going bad (like \\"The Pegasus\\" in TNG), and the cinematic extravaganza that occurs near the end when Kirk sacrifices his own life to save the crew.  I think it is very interesting how in this reboot Kirk dies and Spock lives, while in TWOK, it was the other way around.  I enjoyed JJ Abrams' approach in solving this problem, so more movies could come forth from this one.<br /><br />Most importantly, this movie did everything that a great Star Trek movie should do - it involved a great storyline, good character development, and a fully satisfying villain who the crew had to defeat.  It also paid homage to many things about Star Trek which made it so great.  It was funny, scary, action-packed, and riveting.  Even though you knew in the end that the crew would prevail, it didn't stop you from gripping the edge of your seat as you waited for it to happen.  Put simply, it caused Star Trek to shine yet again and I fully believe that Gene Roddenberry is looking down smiling about this one.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie yet, please go see it and relax and enjoy it.  Don't overanalyze it or sit there and pick it apart.  Just watch the movie and be happy that there are people who love this franchise so much that they keep on making new movies.  I think that this movie will go down as among the best of the series.<br /><br />Finally, I sincerely hope that at the end when it seems like the 5-year mission was going to be launched, that this means there will be more of these movies to come.  There are several great story lines from the original series that could use a fresh reboot, and I hope to see one of those someday.t also reminded one of the episodes from Star Trek : Enterprise where the Augments were first described.

B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Perfect love/suspense movie!<br />I bought it and will watch it over and over again with the whole family.<br />I definitely recommend it!!
B002RI98BA|4.0|Goodwin puts us into the minds of Lincoln and the 1860 Rivals running for President. A great study of what each were thinking and how it altered their political approach. It seems that Goodwin has taken the unbiased approach of portraying the rivals as normal men of ambition, intelligence, hard work, and all with faults. Wonderful backdrop for an important period of American history.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great. I love this game but to many missions about them asking to post stuff about the game. I do recommend it
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but this was a really good movie.  Very entertaining and suspenseful. Definitely worth watching.
B008B68IV8|5.0|The doll is graced. He/she can buy without fear. My daughter loved. I should buy the another of the collection.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Bought it so I could carry it and re-read it on my Windows Phone and Kindle Fire and not carry my hardcover first edition around with me. Definitely one of Stephenson's best and a keeper.
0307463745|5.0|It's an easy read, keeps you interested throughout the book. By that I mean it doesn't want to put you to sleep. I learned quite a bit from this book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this in a few days. Loved it. Not just about the mission but about the people, events and training that led up to it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so fun! After playing a few times, I was already hooked. I kept wanting to beat my personal best while improving my car along the way. It's a great game and it will keep you entertained for quite a while.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|I have had so much fun playing this game and trying to beat my times.  Hopefully I will succeed in getting them all under 4 minutes
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great characters well written, interesting plots that stay relatively close to real law - given the demands of creating an exciting drama. While I love the character of Kalinda, who is an amalgam of all possible private investigators combined with a secret agent, and therefore not realistic - but what a great character to add to the show. The British actress portraying her does a fantastic job.<br />Better than Ali McBeal or other legal soap operas - no real comparison currently, except some of the better medical dramas.<br />The fact that the writers are able to effectively make almost all of the major AND minor characters feel true is a major accomplishment. The teenager are doing an incredible job and they have great lines and plot points - not stereotypes, but real people.
1449410243|5.0|I keep this book in my office. It's an attention grabber, definitely worth the price, and whoever happens to pick it up finds at least something in it funny. Enjoy! It's well worth the purchase.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This is the ONLY show this year that I actually chafe at waiting for the next episode to arrive. So far - the logic of the science has been OK - nothing too far out there and nothing cartoonish or comic book-ish. The main actress is excellent! I hope that she can keep up the job of distinguishing the various clones and keep them separate. So far the writers have kept the plot interesting and the characters &#34;realistic&#34;; they haven't descended into cartoonish exaggerations.<br /><br />Great plot and story line so far - just hope they don't go off to La-La Land (like Warehouse 13) or create some super antagonist that devours the plot lines (like 90% of paranormal dramas) or get carried away with a red herring sub-plot like the Juliette story line in Grimm.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that the show started off without any explanation of why the main characters in a BBC production that supposedly is placed in NYC, spoke with British accents - it felt odd and took two episodes to understand that the foster parent brought them over to America when they were teenagers  - and that has obviously now been an important plot point. But it would have taken only 20 seconds of relevant dialogue to mention they came to America from England - which would still open the question of how and why.

0321543726|4.0|This book covers a lot of fundamentals of C++ programming. This book builds on the core foundation of the language and is extremely detailed on the basics of programming. By the time you finish the first 5 chapters (including the exercises, I can't stress how important it is to do ALL the exercises) you'll have a strong understanding of procedural programming (variables, functions, errors and basic containers, vectors and strings, not Object Oriented just yet!). After this the book introduces OOP basics. After completing this book, you will have strong knowledge in the BASICS of C++, and then its up to you to pursue advanced C++.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Movie is a total downer. Not at all a fun comedy. Perhaps not meant to be, but that's what I thought it would be. Very disappointed and made me want to give up on life. Would not recommend at all. Waste of life and time.
B008133MDK|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Sherlock Holmes. The sexual tension between John and Sherlock is also one of the reasons I keep coming back for more. But, other than that, the show is intelligently written and well-acted.
B0040IAZVM|5.0|Benefits abound in repertoire and sound, though the restoration for some performances must have been an uphill task. I learned Haskil's Mozart concerti #s 9,20,and 23 with Sacher (9 and 23) and Paumgartner (20) on wretched Epic nee Philips lps. Glassy, cavernous piano sound- it is upgraded ca 50% here, but not nearly as good as the sound for Haskil's DG #s 19 and 27 with Fricsay or her concerto #13 with Lucerne strings/ Baumgartner. The Beethoven concerto #4 with Carlo Zecchi/LPO also sounds much better than the Decca Ace of Clubs lp. In it Haskil is especially mesmerizing in the slower, more lyrical themes of the first movement and all of the second-beautiful tone, tenderness and pearly articulation.  I don't think that her Winterthur Beethoven 3 and Mozart 19+20 add much, but both versions of the Philips Beethoven sonatas opus 31/2 and 3 are welcome-tremendous energy, power, and joy.  31/2,<br />which has received some soporific readings, is duly stormy with a rhapsodic second movement. Haskil's Schumann is idiomatic, and her concerto with Hague/Van Otterloo/Philips remains a favorite version.  The Beethoven and Mozart<br />violin sonatas with Arthur Grumiaux also sound upgraded sonically-the piano presence has been increased.  In the Beethoven especially, they favored quick tempi which usually work- actually the Kreutzer sonata could use even more explosiveness I think. The Mozart solo works (k330 sonata, 265 and 573 variations) and the Schubert Bb sonata D960 remain faultless.<br />I am less thrilled by  her two Beethoven third concerti with Markevitch and Swoboda-they lack sufficient fire in the outer movements c.f Fleisher/Szell, Serkin/Ormandy and Moravec/Neumann. Markevitch is better in the Haskil concerti 20 and 24. This box is a long term treasure.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Read Doris' book. Great book and great movie and a great American story. Makes one feel proud of our system of government.
B000OPPSX0|4.0|On lp the piano sound was recessed so that Haskil's excellent playing and interplay with Grumiaux could not register fully.  As with their two discs of Mozart sonatas, the sound is now improved (from a C+ to a B) and is more enjoyable.<br />Grumiaux and Haskil were a great team, two prodigies who played each's other's instruments almost equally well. (Grumiaux later recorded the Mozart sonata k481 playing both parts.) Tempi in in the outer movements of the Beethoven<br />are usually brisk, and the playing is volatile and exciting in them. They do not rush the slow movements which contain much profound music, especially in ops 12/1,12/3, 24, 30/2, 47 and 96.  Haskil reminds me of Argerich but can be a bit more sculpted-both recorded too few Mozart concerti, especially Argerich. I find Argerich's DG partner Gidon Kremer<br />adept interpretively but unpleasant tonally, while Grumiaux in excellent in both areas.  Had Argerich recorded more<br />of the sonatas with Perlman than the Kreutzer  their set would have been more formidable. Argerich is at least a full peer of Haskil in her EMI and DG Kreutzers, and Haskil in this cd set sounds more dynamic than she did on lp.<br /><br />Peers:  sets- Grumiaux/Arrau/Philips (6 sonatas only), Perlman/Ashkenazy/Decca, Perlman/Argerich/EMI (opus 47 only),<br />  Szeryng/Haebler/Philips, Szeryng/Graffman Live (#s 1,3, and 9 only), Stern/Istomin/Sony (best are #s 1 and 7), Schneiderhan/Seemann/DG, Morini/Firkusny/MCA/(#s 3,5,7 and 8 only.

B008B11RLQ|5.0|I own at least 120 Elvis CDs, including the FTD Releases, and many compilations, and this set is awesome!  It is a fantastic set for a beginner or for someone who owns them all.  It is a very compact case that can be easily kept in your car or taken on vacation.  The sound is awesome.  There may be some repeat songs, but it is well worth buying. I grew up playing the original albums over and over so it is great to hear them again this way.  I got it 1/3 the price here than other places I looked.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A very good read that flows from paragraph to paragraph throughout the chapters.  Hosseini fully develops each character and brings them to life in all of their joys, disappointments, pain, sorrow.
B007IK44CK|2.0|Although plots in this genre are often contrived this movie sets a new standard. Action is well done but often at the expense of any real plot development.
B0055SWM08|5.0|To me, so far, this has been the only game/app I have gotten that keeps me entertained. It gets reasonably harder as you go level to level. There always seems to have a solution to the puzzle, so if you get stuck, you can always skip or stop and come back later . It  is a great game!

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|This is an okay version of Jane Eyre.  I saw this film in the movies and liked it better on the big screen. I have several other versions of Jane Eyre.  Each is a little different; but, most are better than this version.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|this app is really good and useful. The one and two star reviews that don't review the app but review if people should or shouldn't be able to do it in their head or if fractions are taught in school are not welcome or needes. it is not useful or fair to anyone to review the app based on this. with the exception of the network access this app is pretty good. Now if we could get  people would just stop flaming just because they feel like complaining and whining
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Best TV show I can remember in a long time. I bought this box set as a gift after I addicted a friend with my seasons. Don't ever read ahead about the next season on amazon or elsewhere. Don't even read the jackets too far. Do watch the deleted scenes and unaired extended versions when available.

193700788X|5.0|I totally loved this book - Sookie got the HEA she deserved (with a man who can give her a life and a marriage and children, and all the things she's dreamed of). She and Sam have had chemistry from the beginning (their makeout scene that Bill interrupts is one of my favorites in the series), and any good lasting relationship is based on friendship. I loved that we got to see all of our old friends, and that they all rushed to Sookie's aid. I think Eric's storyline was very believable - and I am a BIG Eric fan and always loved the Sookie/Eric pairing - because even though he did love her, he is a thousand (plus) year old vampire, who has not gotten where he is by letting himself be blinded by love. Having him throw everything away for Sookie would have been way out of character for him. And, the incomparable Ms. Harris is publishing a book in October to let us know what happened with all of the characters we've come to love so much. So I say thank you, five stars, and I can't wait to pick up your next series!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good game! It's easy to understand, fun to play, and mildly addicting.  Coin regeneration is a nice feature...I'm too cheap to actually buy coins.  :)

We've tried several so far and all have been spot on!  The book includes anecdotes and fun commentary making it more than just a cookbook. Also features fun illustrations that the kids can enjoy when choosing recipes.  You will want to/need to double these recipes!

B002I9Z8B2|5.0|After 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture, despite financial success, was tepidly received by both critics and the audience, Paramount Pictures wrestled creative control of the Trek film series away from Gene Roddenberry and gave it to television producer Harve Bennett along with a drastically-reduced budget. After familiarizing himself with the original television series, Bennett zeroed in on a single episode, \\"Space Seed,\\" as holding the most story potential for his sequel, and he hired a young up-and-coming writer/director named Nicholas Meyer to helm the project. The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is by nearly every standard the crown jewel of the Star Trek franchise, the standard against which everything else will be judged. It is a pop culture milestone, the film that truly announced that Star Trek was back and it was going to stay that way. Despite some poorly aged production design (honestly, who thought oval-shaped screens on square boxes was a good idea?) the film still holds up quite well due to the excellent storytelling. Character, not spectacle, is paramount here; the cast's age is made an asset, not a disadvantage, to explore themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and coming to grips with one's mortality. Director Meyer's influence forced a more formal, naval appearance to the Starfleet uniforms, bringing a more seafaring, adventurous sensibility to the filmic universe, peppering the script with quotes from Shakespeare, Dickens, and Melville that inform the narrative, and despite the heavy subject matter being mindful to include a dollop of wit every so often to keep the film from sinking under the weight of melancholy. From Ricardo Montalban's operatic performance, Shatner's immortal cry of \\"KHAAAAAAAN!\\", the battle in the magenta hues of the Mutara Nebula, and what is easily the most emotional of all Trek finales, the film is littered with memorable moments.<br /><br />When Paramount Pictures prepared the originalTrek films for Blu-ray release in 2009, The Wrath of Khan was the only one in the batch to receive a full restoration, and the proof is in the pudding -- this is a gorgeous, filmic transfer with rich colors and a significant boost in detail; I had never noticed the numbers on U.S.S. Reliant's shuttle bays until viewing this Blu-ray. Sound is also excellent, with [[ASIN:B002IAPHK8 James Horner's rousing score]] sounding better than ever.<br /><br />Unlike the [[ASIN:B0000683DH two-disc DVD special edition]], the Blu-ray contains the original theatrical cut of the film instead of Nicholas Meyer's director's cut; most viewers (including myself) won't really notice as these are only minor trims, but it would have been nice if Paramount had taken advantage of seamless branching to offer both versions. Extras are all replicated, including Meyer's original commentary, along with a new commentary featuring Meyer and Manny Coto and a nice new interview with James Horner about his experience on the film, which was his big break into mainstream film scoring.<br /><br />For Trekkies, for sci-fi geeks, for film lovers, this disc has my highest recommendation.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|This movie was not put together very well, storyline was difficult to follow, did not keep my interest, I still don't understand the complete meaning of the film.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|First of all I'd like to say that I liked the film.Not for its ability to translate the novel,which it didn't,but for making a film which stood up in its own right,for creating a parallel universe of the Gatsby phenomemon.The excess of the parties was a little too excessive,in that everything seemed too rehearsed,too razz-a-ma-tazz,too many fireworks,too much glitter and confetti,it all looked like it was going to go up in smoke or evaporate.It treated everything like it was pushing success,materialism,designer goods,conspicuous consumption,at the expense of the hollowness andfailure,the disillusionment and disenchantment of Gatsby's dream.It's OK in 2D,by the way.<br /><br />Lurhmann uses a clever framing device as the film opens with Nick Carraway (McGuire),recounting episodes from his life in rehab,unwinding to a psychiatrist in detox from alcohol.This forms the basis of his writing of the novel The Great Gatsby.He is both inside and outside everything like Fitzgerald looking in to worlds that exclude him.This is a useful technique to have the narrator tell the story.But it makes the mistake somewhere in an early party of saying he'd been drunk just twice in his life!What Lurhmann does well is recreate the area of East Egg and West Egg, and the stretch of water in between Gatsby's mansion and Daisy's and Tom's Buchanan.<br /><br />The drive from New York through the marvellous Ash Heaps near the Wilson's garage, is superbly realized,with help from a camera moving skywards out into the water.The fast cars are very fast with beautiful coach work.Best of all DiCaprio pulled off the greatest of the 3 filmed Gatsby's.He hints at the great dream that's driven him to create his mansion and all his wealth as well as the dark side.Cary Mulligan too suggests very well the unobtainable rich girl,but also the shallowness and inability to take responsibility after the crash or even to choose Gatsby after all.The minor characters,the Wilson's,Jordan Baker,Dan Cody not drawn sowell.Joel Edgerton plays Tom Buchanan as if to the manner born,with nastiness and aggression.<br /><br />Jaz-y's music is used cleverly to suggest all the influences of the Roaring Twenties as well as the bling.Lurhmann has ventriloquised New York waterways and skyscrapers from his base in Australia using special effects.This film has been hyped for so long I almost never saw it,and its been slated by the critics.But having seen previous films Romeo and Juliet(updated) and Moulin Rouge(all singing & dancing),I think he has done a version of 2013 in 1922 and he's breathed new energy and life(Ok 3D)at a time of depression in world markets into this perfect gem of a book.Whether Daisy was worthy of the intensity of Gatsby's love is another question.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love my dragons :) I'm happy with the game it works well for me. No issues. This is a must have game if you love Dragons
B000WCBPOG|3.0|Both discs are fine, but jewel case has a 1&#34; long grove on the front that if you run your finger over it, it would cut you.  Not &#34;as new&#34; as described.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This item was a a gift and I am sure that it was well received as the person receiving is a James Bond fan and collector of all the tapes.
0714844659|3.0|Mainly alot of the ingredients cannot be bought in the US. It is not practical, as far as the cooking.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It is so realistic and has a simply beautiful story. I loved everything about it. It makes you feel sad but then lifts you up to feel good again.
0374533571|3.0|This was bought as a gift, I have not read myself, but my son said it was a bit different.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I would love to play more like it. It is a<br /> great way to keep your mind sharp and great for critical thinking skills.
B009IA3O2O|4.0|Vocals are incredible.  If you like Kamelot, get this album.  If you have never listened to them, be prepared for a treat.  The lead singer has a remarkable voice and they produce a truly unique sound within the symphonic metal genre.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME AND I AM A BOY AND THIS GAME IS WAY TO AWESOME NOW I CAN BE MYSELF!!!!!!
B00CKC23JC|4.0|I would put this with Scarecrow and Angel of Babylon as good but not great like Metal Opera 1&2 and Wicked Symphony.  The vocals and guest artists are great as always.  There just don't seem to be songs that grab me like on the better albums.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I wish them 2 would get together.  I it kills me when these 2 interact and just look at each other really dreamy eyed and just walk away, I want to scream, just do it for heavens sake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.  Maybe in the next new season???????
B008B3F38C|4.0|I loved April Rain and liked Lucidity.  This album has a darker, harder sound to it.  It may grow on me as I listen to it more.  I would have liked for them to give the lead singer more opportunities to shine as they did in April Rain.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|When you play the game you will see some mistakes so you can download if you want to.<br />  From<br />  Brittany Peterson
B0001EJ4RK|4.0|The product is was in good conditioning. It was still in it's original wrapping (at least I think it was the original wrapping). The white clamshell case itself has some cracks and obvious signs of age, but I suppose it could have been worse. Overall the product was what I asked for, and the cracks are understandable given that it was the cheapest price I could find for the product. It's likely that I will find a different VHS case in better condition and switch out the cover and VHS. It completes my Sleeping Beauty home video collection nicely!
1616550414|5.0|First of all, i liked the the idea of putting the hell of a book in a different box from the other one. I'm a person that cares for the books covers and Amazon did it perfect. :)
0811876373|4.0|This item came just as expected, item was described perfectly.  I purchased it for my pre-teen and friends who are going through a baking and decorating phase
0545128285|5.0|I considered a branch of that Harry Potter series, if you haven't read it you should!!!<br />It's going to be a journey that will bring you back to Hogwarts!!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I almost cried in this....it gave  me a different perspective about autistic kids and what they have  to go through...Read it
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|A decent movie by Bruce.  Nice to see him again in action. Good action scenes right from the beginning of the movie but NOT spectacular and needed more entertaining car chasing scenes.  Body counts relatively low.  Gun fire/weapons used could be souped up to increase the intensity.<br />Sweet ending with them all getting together..<br />Enjoy it but don't expect too much.
B000I9X7M6|5.0|I was in desperate need of this video for my English class to view.  Thank you for having it available!!!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I love Modern Family! Especially when  one minute you are laughing your head off then Phil does something sensitive and that big knot in your throat happens and then tears. It is a roller coaster of emotion based on real life. Modern Family should be prescribed by every doctor along with Friends and I Love Lucy as a cure all!!!
0345531965|1.0|This book starts out gangbusters and I thought wow this is going to be a great novel only to find I was bogged down in the swamps with Nate in an totally boring novel...  After all the great reviews to say I was disappointed and totally surprised is a understatement...  Total dribble!!!!  Don't waste your time or money.  Grisham is turning into a has been....
B006LSZECO|5.0|Riveting unit the last page...going to check out her other books. Unbelievably scary to be married to someone like Amy.
B006LSZECO|1.0|What a waste of time. Slow read, seriously ignorant message. Not even worthy of further comment. I would not recommend this book.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|you like actions and gangsters, this is your movie! Better than I expected, really good acting and good reflection of the times and crimes
1616550414|5.0|The book has great graphics, detailed information, and really takes you back through the games if  you played them.  If you enjoyed the games as much as I did, this is a no brainer.  The binding is great, the book looks great on the outside, and the pages have a quality feel.
B0097K21YW|2.0|This game is amalgamation of Angry Birds, Fragger and similar games wherein you aim at something and shoot or destroy things. I found myself feeling bored in no time especially seeing myself playing and destroying buildings for no reason and the mediocre graphics and physics did not impress me much either. If this game had a story-line of some sorts and a good motivation to destroy the buildings I would have played this game for much longer. But destroying buildings with fireballs pointlessly was boring for me. The graphics are okay, the physics is there but limited and I am sorta tired of Angry birds or similar clones. The controls work but gets difficult as the game progresses as you need to pinch zoom out and aiming becomes difficult. It is definitely not worth the $2 price tag. I deleted it from my Tablet after about 1 hour of fiddle-de-do.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I saw this film prior to my purchase. I bought it for a friend because I thought she would enjoy it. She HATED it!!! It was too dark for her. Needless to say, I sent her some movies that I knew shed loved and asked her to pop Life of Pi in the mail because it's one of the few movies I would actually love to own.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|This game has some good strategy to win against the AI, But the graphics are very rudimentary and looks very poorly made graphics on a 10 inch tablet. It took me a while to figure out the game-play. The hint is present in the help sections but even after learning how to play the game did not keep me interested for too long. May be I am poor with strategy based games or the poor graphics diverted my attention too soon. For 99c this game should have been polished further. All-in-one a okay strategy game but you do seem to lose interest too soon as it requires extensive thinking abilities to win this game against the AI.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is fantastic. I love everything about it. Being free makes it awesome. I highly recommend the app to everyone. I have a Kindle fire and have not had any problems. Thanks for the app.
B004TI1WME|4.0|It is a nice app to have if you are into documenting everything you spend on and keep a trail of your spending. The app's ability to do expense calculations and this being the 'Pro' version of Office Calculator without any advertisements to distract your attention and works without the need for network access is no brainier to purchase this over the free version. The Virtual tape *does* expire automatically unless you explicitly state to save it forever by using the \\"Never\\" option.<br /><br />If the developer reads reviews made by others and adds the 'export' option of the virtual tape and also adds the ability to export them to a properly formatted file that can be attached to email or XL spreadsheet then it will be very convenient to save the file elsewhere and start a new virtual tape.<br /><br />Having said, It is still a good app for keeping track of expenses and for the price is well worth it.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|The ending makes the movie worth a viewing. For me the actors seemed to be acting, even a decent plot couldn't help the non chemistry but what I did like was the surprise ending.
B00992CF6W|1.0|okay so I bought this game and had it for about a month now, I play it every day and loved it.<br />UNTIL it lagged today and froze, so when I turned the whole device off and on again I restarted my world.<br />literally.<br />all over again.<br />whatever I was holding I still had.<br />same with my other 3 worlds and my creative.<br />so I fixed one, made a new house blab blab blab,<br />but then I turned off the app and went on facebook.<br /><br />within 4 minutes IT DID IT AGAIN<br />IM SO DONE.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great, intriguing story... couldn't put the book down. I enjoyed the character development and the thrilling storyline. However, the ending was a bit of a disappointment. Still worth reading if you like a good mystery!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|ordered this for a Christmas present for my daughter. It arrived fast and it perfect condition and she is very satisfied with it.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Wow the first effort was great but the 2nd Album shows much growth  see them in concert before they play in large venus
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful artwork, very original puzzles&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;Reminds me of the marginal Myst. The clues are helpful but keep the puzzle challenging.  I love that it is divided into chapters-- Definitely a new favorite!!
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This movie is a joy to watch and I could never get sick of it, even after watching it every night with my niece and nephew.  The narration by Helen Bonham Carter is great and the animation is captivating.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|lots of stuff to do and stuff and you collect money and stuff and try and make it off the streets and stuff
1400082773|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from my mother and i must say that I wasn't disappointed. Beautifully written, it gives and insight into the early life and background of the President before his rise to political office. There is something endearing about the book in that it shows him as human, not as Mr President. Its in essence, the story of his childhood, his humble beginnings, his struggles with his identity as a young black man in America and his mixed parentage. His absent father is a central theme in the book and is the link that pulls the whole story together in many ways, as so much of Mr Obama's struggles to embrace his identity as an adult were linked to the mixed emotions and somehow complex relationship that he had with his father. Overall, it is a story about family, about love, about heritage, about overcoming all the odds, about coming of age. Ultimatley, it is a story about acceptance and peace. A truly inspiring read.
B000ICXQS8|5.0|This is the fourth time I have viewed this movie with its enchanting scenery and music and slow-moving, melancholic style.  I adore this film and recommend it to anyone.
145210655X|5.0|This book is so cute!!!! I would recommend to any father and Star Wars fan. My son (6 years old) even gets a kick out of it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked this book until the last few chapters. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll only say that I thought what happened was very implausible. The main character made a decision that I really couldn't see anyone making, given the situation, so that kind of spoiled it for me.
1451648537|5.0|This book is a biography of Steve Jobs the founder of apple by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson spent some time in the intimacy of the  Jobs family before Steve's  death to gather  the  information he needed to write this book . Why this book, simply because it gives us an insight of people who wants to succeed and are confident and stubborn enough to do it no matter what. The book review the whole life of Steve even before he was born . The book starts with a overview of both the biological and adoptive parents  of Steve, then his adoption by the Californian couple. It is remarkable how the personality of Steve is described in the early stages of his life. A weirdo who drop out of college, went to India for a While, got his girl friend pregnant, and at the same time still managed to start his own company with almost no resources and just a fixed idea. His life of boem  was my favorite describing him as a hippie and a dirty person with  the stereotype that comes with and he overturned all that into the character well known and admired today. After that it goes on to the creation of the company and the struggle at the beginning then to actually raising money and hiring people, the conflict between jobs and some of his coworker  , the division in the society and so on and so forth . The book is a great source of inspiration for the idea of American dream and  what most of the people try to accomplish in this country , being entrepreneur  and independent. This book goes beyond the domain of technology and business to other concepts such as the original position concept and the theory of personal identity in philosophy in understanding the thinking of the principle personage.  I don't know if it's because I'm a fan of Apple, but certainly the way the book depict Steve  which seems objective makes the reader appreciate the character beyond the first idea that we have from the media. I hope everyone will enjoy the book as much as I did.<br />Ps: I could go on in the content of the book, but I don't want to spoil more than that for any future reader.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|my niece was a newborn at the time and it seemed like she really enjoyed. she wouldnt look away from the screen and would smile and laugh at some moments.
B00003CXI1|3.0|what can you say about a DVD? it either works or it does not.  This one works as I expected
B007TNS6JI|5.0|You would really love this game if your into fantasy and it is worth to get it especially on kindle fire because it is better and less lag

B001V5CIFI|4.0|Kids (ages 9 - 15) loved it, therefore a success! I mentioned that it was similar to Mary Poppins, so then we had to rewatch that, now they want to see the sequel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm 50ish old grandma, I am totally hooked on this game.  I even got my 14 yr old granddaughter playing it.  If you start playing you won't want to stop.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I've ALWAYS loved this movie since I saw it when I was about 12 years old.  Visually magnificent.  A marvelous Lerner and Lowe score and the always poignant tale of Arthur and Guinevere.  Vanessa Redgrave at her most beautiful.
0545265355|5.0|I recently bought the box set just for both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' for an English class, and I knew it was well known and beloved series that recently got a feature film; however, i did not know exactly for what reason. After reading the first book, I wanted to instantly jump into the second. The characters, the setting, the tension, the storytelling from a first person perspective was simply an immerse experience for me. Of course, I didn't feel like a 16 year old girl, but I felt as though i was unable to read other character's minds or motives, and i actually entrapped in the suspense and made me question, &#34;what is that person thinking?&#34; and &#34;what are they up to?&#34;. It is an amazing feeling, and it is an amazing story that is almost over for me. I fully recommend buying this box set as it is worth every cent.<br /><br />May the books be ever in your collection.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Redford at his most beautiful as the WASPy Hubbell Gardner paired with left wing Katie.  The fact that they can't make it work despite what they feel for each other gets to you every time.

B000000OA6|5.0|magic!. each word has a haunting poignant beauty. but amazingly without self-pity and indeed, with humor and whimsy and joy intact. lovely melodies. great rhythms.  great singing (not over the top..but simple and great). with his ravaged body, how he pulled this off, will remain a mystery. i ignored this album for a long time (why?).. suddenly, on a whim i bought the re-released LP.. wow.  this is essential music.  mercury sets the standard  on how to go down.. smiling, happy, and doing what he does best-- making great music and making others happy to be alive.

B00CSR2J9I|3.0|ok it is an ok app but finally it came out on kindle right after it wasn't popular any more. just like temple run I mean come on I have a kindle fire and I still think that the kindle app store sucks

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in spite of the fact that there were 2-3 over-talky moments.  The appeal of the characters, the level of action, the intrigue and the mysticism are again present in high level of quality and quantity.  I had been concerned that stretching one book into a movie trilogy would lessen the tale.  I was wrong because Peter Jackson made a movie that provides a bridge to the lord of the Rings trilogy.  He also takes the time to visually tell the background stories of the main characters.  The 2-3 longer verbal moments (something he actually did in his LOTR movies) do give the movie fan a chance to think and catch one's breath.  Overall, it is a visually-stunning, colorful and engaging movie.  Like his earlier trilogy, I believe each film will get better and end in a wonderful climax.
B00A3XWB10|3.0|Tons of potential and not a bad CD. Didn't find myself listening over and over but look forward to their next work.
1450419895|5.0|This is an excellent book for novice and expert. Great detail and nice illustrations. Very insightful book to add to any library.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After getting the mouse you simply plug it in and go to Anker's web page to get any updates for the mouse.  From there you can customize what everything is on the mouse, right down to the color of the Anchor on the back of the mouse.  The down side to that is the anchor is the only part of the mouse that changes color, so it can look a little funny if you have a blue mouse wheel and a green or red anchor.  The plastic the mouse is made of feels a little cheap, but it is durable and can survive a cat playing with it (speaking from experience).  5 stars from me.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoyed very much I just don't like that you can't do very much with the free version.. you should not say free version because after about an hour of play you have to purchase the game it should say this is only a free sample......
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game to waste time, wish I could learn how to rotate the city! Energy builds a bit to slow and it seems like the expansion land is not always worth the coin you spend to get it.

B00B2166BS|4.0|This charger easily connects to the Nexus 10 without the hassle of finding the proper socket and aligning the plug.  Saves the wear and tear associated with a micro USB charger connection.  I added a sticker to the \\"front\\" side of the connector to make it easier to properly align the magnetic connector.  The chord is a little too short and requires a nearby receptacle -- I frequently seem to bump either the device or chord, resulting in the connector pulling loose since the chord does have any slack and the magnet is not that strong.
B0006VBFM0|4.0|Great for a casual summer watch  surprisingly easy to read.  I was tired of always pulling out my phone to check the time!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very fun!  I saw my friend playing it once and knew I wanted it.  Coins are easy to earn so you don't have to play forever to unlock new things, which I like. This is an all around great game.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig has done a decent job as 007 but he really hits his stride in Skyfall. His first outing in Casino Royale was a decent introduction to the new look of Bond but Quantum of Solace was a bust. That failure is forgotten in Skyfall with an excellent story and outstanding performances by Craig and company, especially the inestimable Dame Judy.
0452298482|5.0|Wonderful advice from older people. Should be required reading in schools.  Enjoyed it immensely!<br />People of all ages will take something away from this that applies to their lives.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I love games that make me think. For those of us who enjoyed games like &quot;Mist,&quot; this game is way to easy and short. I do look forward to the next game though.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It seems like a stupid game at first, oh wow im gonna pop some balloons , but its beast. BEST GAME EVER WARNING EXTREMELY ADDICTING
0553384775|1.0|I came across this book when I read that it was supposedly the inspiration for the move Boiler Room. I found that movie very entertaining and interesting, so I looked forward to reading The Wolf of Wall Street.<br /><br />I could not have been more disappointed.  I thought this would be a non-fiction account of the inner workings of a Wall Street chop-shop, with anecdotes of the excessive lifestyle of Wall Street brokers.  The book started promising; Belfort describing his first day at a brokerage, where he would start at the bottom, but alluding to the fact that he would be the boss of his supervisors in a few short years and own the very restaurant where his boss took him to lunch.  He doesn't touch alcohol, would never cheat on his girlfriend, and wants nothing to do with drugs.  Inexplicably, the book jumps six years in the future, when Belfort is fabulously rich, in charge of his own brokerage, already married for the second time (he hadn't even been engaged in the first chapter), and doing copious amounts of various drugs.  From there forward, the book is just a description, in excruciating detail, of  Belfort's daily life.  Twenty-two pages of chapter 2 describe a moronic fight he has with his wife and how great her legs and private parts look.<br /><br />The reader never does find out how Belfort got into such a position or how his current firm makes so much money.  Or, how he went from being straight-laced to a hedonist. The story is not interesting or compelling, just Belfort's grandiose descriptions of his life, how many things he owns, how much they cost, and how many drugs he does.  Others have commented on the shortcomings of this book; I won't repeat them, because every negative review is spot-on.  I will say that Jordan Belfort should personally apologize to all the trees that were cut down to make the paper to print this garbage.<br /><br />As a final note, when I read self-indulgent crud like this, I try to find inconsistencies in the narrative.  Here's just one - in describing a period of time around the winter of 1993, Belfort writes: \\"I had lots of nicknames: Gordon Gekko, Don Corleone, Kaiser Sozer: they even called me King.\\"  Putting aside the obvious hubris, the movie The Usual Suspects did not come out until 1995.  One wonders what else isn't exactly true in The Wolf of Wall Street. Then again, the story telling is so bad, who cares.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I have been really burned out on zombie films or shows of late, but this show goes beyond a bunch of mindless zombies. This show is brutal (especially seasons 2 & 3) in the fact that they allow you plenty of opportunity to get attached to a character, then at the least expecting moment, rid them from the show by the most brutal methods that can be conjured. This applies to men women and children, once again showing that they have no regard for what characters they strip away from you. This show is about zombies, but more so about surviving the aftermath of the apocalypse.
0321356683|2.0|I am not a complete beginner to programming, but I found many of the examples really difficult to follow what was trying to be taught; however, much of the book does make valid points.
B00787IR2Q|4.0|I can remember watching and enjoying this movie when I was a child, now my kids enjoy it as well.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|This tragedy of a movie should have been left alone as a simple childs board game period. I watched this movie that was so cliche written it wasnt funny. The acting was sooo, bad they must have used a group of amatures or got some locals  to participant because filming would have been alot cheaper either way it didnt work for me. Another cliche is the guy gets the beautiful girl, which I dont know why since he came off so creepy in the first place with the microwave chicken burrito and all. Then with a criminal felony he goes to the navy moves up in rank within a few weeks, well thats what it looked like to me any way, gets to command his own ship first time on the water. Needless to say our hero saves the day from a bunch of crazy WWE wrestling looking aliens. Hollywood once again has turned out a turkey.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Deals with  many varieties of situations parenthood can bring...thought it was more of a laugh out loud comedy...although there are funny parts, there are also serious moments...
B00A81MV3U|2.0|The acting was good, the movie was not. Jennifer Lawrence  was exceptional in her  charactor role, Bradly Cooper also, but the story was so unreal it made me fall a sleep!
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Bon Jovi is still keeping it real. Love that their music evolves with them! Enjoying them for years! Great job guys!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was surprised by the whole book.  It was difficult to predict each player's next move.  That made it a good read.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada was a grand old time, with evil Nazis, slinky ladies, and more explosions than I was expecting (which is always a plus). It was aggressively plotted, which kept it moving well, and the length was quite nice for a quick read over a day or two.<br /><br />Stevenson casts Fleming as a James-Bond-before-James-Bond, an agent of the Naval Intelligence Department who claims to ride his desk but in reality gets involved in a very important field mission to win over the French Navy. Fleming's hard drinking swagger and daring are at times a bit over the top, but in the way that we all want. And in World War II, the last great heroic conflict in the West, he seems to fir perfectly.<br /><br />It was a fun read--a ripsnort. I would recommend it.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My 4 y/o loves this app! It's one of her favs. And so easy for her to figure it out on her own. One of our favs so far!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Previous novels have always had twists and turns, and something new.  This book was more like a mass of previous novels cut and pasted together. Nothing fresh, nothing new, and too predictable.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 4 1/2 yo daughter LOVES this app! It is very engaging (I love it too). She'll play with it forever. So far it's one of my (I mean her) favs!
0425252868|5.0|One of my favorite TV series as a kid was &#34;Twelve O'clock High&#34; so whenever I see a B-17 it catches my attention. I had never heard of this book but after spotting that awesome cover I had to pick it up and check it out. I sure am glad I did. The story that inspired the book is incredible, but the insight gained from the perspective of the flying ace Franz Stigler and the German Luftwaffe was absolutely riveting. And the ending brought tears to my eyes. If you liked &#34;Flyboys&#34; and &#34;Unbroken&#34;, this book is for you.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Not quite what I expected.  I have to say it's well constructed and easy to carry in a pocket or ?????
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|not much to say i love them and their music, great songs to listen to while driving or needing to feel strong...
B008JJM88Q|2.0|Akinator is pretty darn cool, don't get me wrong, but why buy an app when you can just go on the website on the Kindle browser for free?!
B000I9WWHW|5.0|I've watched this movie at least 20 times.... It's very colorful and atrsy and has a warm message through the dark undertones and struggles of the movie...One of my favorites..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh how exciting this  whole Wool Series has been to read. I'm such a fan of your writing as is my 17yr daughter. We drive or during dinner we talk all about the series. My husband's jealous. We loved Molly Fyed series too. Wish you could write faster  Now I'm reading all the other authors Wool spin off.<br />To anyone reading this review I'd like to tell you to get ready for a great series when you start with Wool. I promise you'll become a big fan after you read Highs book.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|The book was recommended to me by a friend once he found out I liked \\"Ender's Game.\\" It was a fun read but I felt it ended a little too early. Of course it means that a sequel is in order so I'll keep on reading Scalzi's books to find out what happens next.
B000002W9Q|5.0|this is a great cd , I also have the dvd of this cd<br />I got this cd for my wife

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is good but it does get boring.It basically...well everyone knows what subway surfers is if you dont ask a friend.Only joking its a bit like temple run but you use your fingers instead of tilting.you can collect coins to buy boosts and characters.i would definitely recommend.thanks for reading you can read my other reviews if you want.<br /><br />Thanks Miss A.J.Davanna
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is the best SciFi of its kind. Combines stellar science fiction themes with time travel of a different nature.<br />Virtual hide and seek between alternate dimensions.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it but I am alittle slow at it. Just need more practice.<br />It's fast for an 88 year old woman.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|This movie is very slow and the plot was very thin. There were moments of suspense but those moments were few and far between. It would have been better if they ended it 20 min early.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I got this app thinking that it would be fun,but Tom wouldn't repeat anything! Pointless putting it on the Amazon store if it doesn't work for kindle!
B000HL093A|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies. The movie holds up beginning to end. I would say that everyone should see this movie at least once.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|The CD was a little grimy when I received it but after I wiped it off there were no scratches or anything. I'm a big Rise Against fan and I'd have to say that this CD is pretty good but not quite their best.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I Love the watch.  It is everything I expected and use it on a regular basis. I would highly recommend it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|CD arrived in great condition and I love buying from these guys, they never let me down. Also I am a huge Linkin Park fan and this is my favorite CD by them. It's heavier than Minutes to Midnight and about as heavy as Hybrid Theory. Love it.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|One of my favorite shows. Love the Sherlock character. Great acting<br />Watson is awesome too. Excellent writing for the show
B0044CG71G|5.0|All you have to do is look online and search Fringe vs...and immediately Xfiles comes up and autocompletes for you to show you the vast comparisons. I didn't watch Fringe until after it was available to stream all 5 seasons...so I didn't get the anticipation of waiting for every new episode to come out. It was different in the case of X-Files. Like much of the x-files fan base, I was waiting for it each week..talking about it the next day. X-Files was a very new type of show with great character development. Where it was a bit weak, and had in my opinion started to unravel..was its inability to stay focused on it's major story arc with a clear vision. I loved the X-Files, still do.<br /><br />Fringe, while it feels familiar, is a very different show. It doesn't focus on the supernatural at all...or on aliens. It does focus on time travel and alternate realities. While that may be the main technical detail that fanboys use to differentiate the shows...I don't think its the big difference. For me, it is really the style of character development that makes them different.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Mulder/Scully comparison, you won't find one. Fringe has a much more developed ensemble driven story. Many characters are given changes to shine and have relevance to the story. Mulder and Scully had a formula between them that is hard to imitate or top. I don't think Fringe tries to do that.<br /><br />John Noble's character of Walter Bishop is amazing. I don't think X-Files has a comparable element. Walter adds an emotional depth to Fringe that is based on deep loss and remorse. His guilt and pain are so profound that we have seen him shattered and fragmented. Even his character alone will draw you into fringe. Mulder's loss of his sister while a good driver for the story of the X-Files canon...is never as deeply felt as Walter's losses.<br /><br />If you liked X-Files, you'll like Fringe I think, as long as you aren't expecting a clone. It's the same genre, no question about it.estion about it.
B009SBSQOO|5.0|Great songs, great voice, great music<br /> I love this CD, , it is fantastic. Glad I bought it. I am enjoying it !
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|From the first trailer I saw of this film, I knew it was unique. I became even more intrigued when I read the various reactions to it; I tend to enjoy most films that divide audiences. I missed it in the theaters, but figured it was deep enough to warrant acquiring unseen. But I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.... in fact, I loved it, so much that I started watching it again right after it ended.<br /><br />Probably the reason for that was the very experience of watching six stories unfold simultaneously in one sitting. Even though I had no problem getting drawn into and following each one, I did feel I needed a little refresher for things I might have missed at the outset. When you do that with this film, you notice little things that reference the other stories, foreshadowing bits, numerous \\"Aha\\" moments and recurring elements like the comet birthmark, the composer's music playing at a social function, relationships between specific actors' characters proving significant in different incarnations (deja-vu anyone?), etc. This is no leave-your-mind-at-the-door type of entertainment; this is an engage your mind deeply for the full 175 minutes because everything matters on multiple levels aural experience.<br /><br />As mentioned, six plots: In 1849 an attourney travels to Chatham Islands to conduct a business arrangement. While there he falls ill, is cared for by a rather shady doctor and on the way back discovers a stowaway slave in his quarters who convinces him to persuade the ship's captain to let him join the crew. A special friendship results. In 1936, an English musician (and hopeful composer) is hired by an older famous composer to help him overcome obstacles to his productivity; soon it becomes apparent that the older man wants to use the younger's own compositional gifts for his own legacy which develops into struggle for personal integrity. In 1973 a woman journalist finds herself drawn into some unsavory dealings between the oil industry and a nuclear power plant, with life threatening results. In 2012, a gangster who just published a book murders a high profile critic, good news for his publisher who enjoys all the profits after the guy goes to prison.... until the thug's former associates (probably characters in the book) show up at his place demanding what they consider their cut. He doesn't have quite as much as they demand, so he goes to his brother for help.... which ends up being a HUGE mistake. On ahead to 2144, in Neo-Seoul, Korea, a young female clone named Sonmi-451 who was genetically engineered for a lifetime of servitude is given a crash course in what it means to have a real life when a series of events partners her up with the rebel commander of a movement known as Union. She quickly becomes a person of great historical consequence. And in 2321 (introduced as \\"106 Winters After the Fall\\"), a member of a tribal society called The Valley reluctantly agrees to escort a visiting female member of a more technically advanced society, The Prescients, to a forbidden mountain temple known as Cloud Atlas, which the Valley tribe considers evil. Braving an enemy tribe of cannibals and an dark presence referred to as Old Georgie, a life-changing revelation awaits.<br /><br />And what's it all about? Well, the film's poster simply states \\"Everything Is Connected\\". That is the theme. Indeed, through attentive watching, many connections are emphasized, and easy to miss if one looks away too long. Another synopsis: \\"An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future\\". Essentially, to call this film an epic would be an understatement, and it's really up to the viewers and their willingness to ride out the journey to decide for themselves what it's \\"about\\". It will resonate with people differently, and many won't get it and tell you it's a bad film because of that. One thing for certain: For a film of this scope, I've never seen one that was better edited.The way it holds together alone is worthy of praise.<br /><br />One challenge I had with watching was picking up the dialect used by the Valley tribesmen, obviously an imagining of how language might evolve over the ages (see Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); some viewers may find that taking getting used to. The onscreen performances are spot on, visual effects (and visuals overall) are seamless, and the makeup used to transform actors across characters (in some cases across genders) is a star in itself. One possible improvement would have been to use actual Korean actors across the board in the Neo-Seoul segment, the only not very convincing makeup I noticed. In no way did that diminish my enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />Apparently this is not a film for everyone. People will either get it or not, perhaps be turned off by certain plot elements enough to want to shut the whole film out. I am with the group that considers it one of the best films ever, as much a departure from studio system dreck as a viewer hungry for originality could want. I don't hand out five star ranks to many movies. Cloud Atlas is perfect enough.The way it holds together alone is worthy of praise.<br /><br />One challenge I had with watching was picking up the dialect used by the Valley tribesmen, obviously an imagining of how language might evolve over the ages (see Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); some viewers may find that taking getting used to.

B0064MPXFA|4.0|I enjoyed the show. I hope all women who stand by their man for the TV camera, act like this character, off camera.
193700788X|4.0|I am very glad I went with my gut and book the hardcover book. After reading the spoilers and comments that other had made, I was already disappointed.<br />But am glad I bought it and read it in a night. I will re-read this book as I have the other books in the series.<br /><br />This may not be my favorite book in the series but I am pleased with the ending.. Thank you Ms. Harris for bringing hours of reading enjoyment throughout the years!!!
B000HF4TIM|4.0|Though not for a young audience, this is one of my all time favorites! Bruce Willis is tough, gritty and a total smart-ass who just doesn't really care anymore, until the danger starts messing with his family. Watch it once and, like me, you will want it in your collection!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game in the world I love playing on it when I'm bored<br />it has a bunch of games in just one app
B001992NUQ|5.0|great movie of its time. makes you think and wonder about your surrounding and everything around it. soap dont drop it
B00006I53S|5.0|Pro: Its extremely versatile in outdoor environments and some indoor. the zoom ranges of 28 to 135mm are perfect and allow for the right amount of zooming when your outdoors and need to approach a subject while still allowing you to zoom back out and take a snap of something closer to your vicinity. The focus speed for any USM is much better then your standard lens and allows for quick snappy focusing without making much noise. Image quality is crisp, clear, and little noise.<br /><br />Con. The manual focus ring is a bit strange, its hard to really feel it move the lens, and because it doesn't stop moving when you reach maximum or minimum focus its hard to tell where the focus is without looking at the dial on the lens or looking through. if you don't take your lens out of auto, its not a problem. and the focus distance dial does help if you don't have a feel for the lens.<br /><br />Finishing up, this is a really good all-purpose lens, that will minimize your need to swap out when your shooting on the go.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|what everybody is waiting for is zombie attack or computer building robots to attack. love this move still  get excited watching this
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Men in Black II wasn't quite as good as the original, but it is definitely worth having in my collection.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I bought the movie for my sister. I wound up watching it again myself. The price can't be beat. We like Hugh Grant.He is very funny in this movie.

B008220C56|1.0|I've seen several versions of \\"Anna\\" and have read the book by Leo Tolstoy twice.  The director and screenplay writer have a warped conception of this great novel!  This movie version is an artsy-gimmicky nightmare.  It didn't even deserve the Academy Award it won for best costumes - \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", should have won!  The dance scenes and choreography are ridiculous.<br /><br />The film shifts back and forth between a playhouse stage and a natural setting.  The horse race scene and the opera house scenes have very cheap scenery and the opera house looks shabby.  The actor playing Vronsky has zero charisma or sex appeal.  He looks like a foppish closet case.  Jude Law is the only remarkable actor in the cast.  Keira Knightly doesn't have the depth or classic beauty for a role like this.  She looks like an anorexic fashion model!<br /><br />The best recent version of this film is the Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean movie.  The Masterpiece Theatre mini-series with Nicola Padget is excellent.  The old b&w versions with Vivian Leigh and Garbo are also recommended.  Please don't waste your time on this pretentious Euro-trash!
B007SSEZNA|5.0|This was an enjoyable version to watch. The cinematography was excellent, and my girls and I especially appreciated the casting!

B000TDFKVW|5.0|As a 77 year old music lover I have passed by much of the music my young friends love.  One of the instructors at my fitness center has been using the music of the group Enigma and by regular listening as we exercise.  It has sunk in - a bit - and I downloaded this album - found YouTube videos to go along with it - and have it running through my head (ear worms, my son tells me).  Ah, the pleasures we miss...and then discover.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Keeps me challenged and is great for passing time when waiting for appointment. My nephews like to play it and ask for my kindle.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|I first got into Hatebreed with Perseverance and Rise of Brutality, but then kind of fell off. Not because they were bad or anything like that, I just got off into other aspects of metal. Now fast forward to 2013. Holy S***. Still killing it with brutal, in your face hardcore. Put It To The Torch kicks it all off and keeps the pedal to the floor all the way through. Dead Man Breathing's opening riffs give a nod to Slayer and the title track- Divinity of Purpose is my favorite. Indivisable, Before The Fight Ends You will also have your fist pumping as well. Get this and get your a** handed to you

B004TI1WME|5.0|This is just what is says it is, a basic office calculator with tape display.  The tape is just great for showing a series of calculations and being able to check your data entry.  This IS NOT a financial calculator and is not presented as such.  I like the decimal and key color choices.  I just got it and will probably discover some more features.  I do prefer the horizontal option which provides somewhat larger keys.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|.. This game is addictive. I play for my daughter when she is at school, can't help it. I want to create a great village.

B00A5FPQBI|4.0|I actually found this movie funny, because of its dialog. I am from the cayman islands so i'm use to the way jamicians speak, but it's something about the way the dialog and action takes place! it's a good gangster movie though

B00AOCLWF6|5.0|There's action and suspense in every episode and I love that it doesn't have any &#34;filler&#34; episodes about nothing. Its hard to watch something week to week when there are boring episodes in between.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Back in 2008 an RPG called Persona 4 hit the Western shores. It was the long awaited sequel to the well known PS2 RPG Persona 3, and before we knew it, it became a hit. Fans fell in love with the character's, the gameplay, the school life &#34;life sim&#34; aspects, as well as it's story. Although the game before it was just as popular among fans, Persona 4 took things to a whole new level. Soon there was a manga series to go along with it, a full anime, and even a direct sequel fighting game produced by Arc System Works. To put it simple, Persona 4 was a game that fans liked a lot, and because of that it evolved past just being a game. Well, things didn't stop there.<br /><br />In 2012 a brand new version of Persona 4 hit the shelves for the PlayStation Vita called &#34;Persona 4 Golden.&#34; Just what is Persona 4 Golden? Is it worth owning if you already had Persona 4? What about the new comers, is this a good place to start? Well, how about we find out?<br /><br />The Golden Story:<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden opens up with &#34;you&#34; being face to face with a strange man in what seems to be a limo. You are in the velvet room, a room that exists between reality and dreams, and you have been called there for a very special reason. Everything that happens in that room is tied to your fate, and it seems your life is about to change. The strange man sitting at the end of the limo is named Igor and he tells you just that. While your future is unclear, he gives you a warning, and asks for your name. At this point you are asked to name your character whatever you want, but the main character's &#34;canon&#34; name is Narukami Yu (Yu Narukami by English standards).<br /><br />After telling Igor his name, Yu (or whatever you named yourself) then comes to reality. He is traveling on a train to a small town called Inaba, where he will be spending the next year of his life. It turns out his parents had been transferred overseas due to their job, and they have decided to send him to live with his uncle Ryotaro and his cousin Nanako Dojima.<br /><br />Once Yu arrives in Inaba, he is greeted by his uncle and cousin, and taken back to his new home. As he sits down with his family for dinner, his uncle gets a call to go into work, and apparently like always, Nanoko is left home alone. It turns out Dojima is a police detective, and because of that he is rarely home alone. Poor little Nanoko is left to fend for herself most of the time, and today is no different. After finishing dinner, Nanoko helps Yu get settled in to his room, and the very next day they both go off to school.<br /><br />While at school Yu slowly begins to make some new friends. Yosuke, just like Yu, is a big city boy who was forced to move to the small town after his parents became the manager of the local super store Junes, Chie is a tomboy kung fu nut, and Yukiko is the shy girl everyone seems to hit on. At first this small group doesn't seem like much, but not too long after they all met, things began to change.<br /><br />During his first day of school, a dead body was found hanging from a TV antenna close to the school, and the strange rumors of a &#34;Midnight Channel&#34; began to circulate. It turns out, if you look at the TV at midnight on a raining night while it is turned off, your &#34;true love&#34; will appear; however only the latter part turned out to be a rumor. As the police investigated the murder, Yu and his friends decide to check out the midnight channel rumor to see if it was true, and sure enough, it was. A young girl showed up on the screen, but it wasn't Yu's true love. As he reaches out to touch the screen, Yu is shocked to find his arm going into the TV! Although he at first tries to climb all the way in, he gets stuck in the TV's frame, and decides to pull himself out and tell his friends about what happened the next day.<br /><br />The next day at school Yu discusses the Midnight Channel with Yosuke and Chie, only to find out that they hadall seen the very same girl. Although everyone is confused as to what the midnight channel is, Yu decides to tell the others about what happened to him; how he went inside the TV. At this point everyone thinks that he was just dreaming, and they decide to pretend he never even brought it up. Although within the next few hours, all of them would come to learn the truth, and their lives would be changed forever.<br /><br />After going to Junes to look at a brand new TV, Yu finds himself falling into a big screen TV, with his friends close behind. They all ends up in a strange world, wonder into a strange blood stained room, and then on their way out they find themselves face to face with a strange bear like thing named Teddie. According to Teddie someone had been throwing people into his world, making the once quite land into a world filled with noise. Since Teddie didn't want to be bothered, he opened a portal back to the &#34;real world,&#34; and sends everyone back home.<br /><br />Deciding to put everything that had just happened behind them, Yu and co decide to return home, and pretend it never happened... Although it seems fate has other plans for them. It turns out the girl on the Midnight Channel was a friend of Yosuke's, and the very next day she is found dead hanging just like the first victim. Yosuke takes the news of her death hard, and that is when he decides to drag Yu back into that strange world with him. If the Midnight Channel and that world are connected to her death, Yosuke was determined to get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />After talking to Teddie about what happened, Yu and Yosuke follow him to a strange dream like version of Inaba. There they find a strange door to the liquor store the girl's family ran, and coming out of it are strange creatures Teddie calls &#34;Shadows.&#34; Upon seeing these shadows, a voice rings through Yu's head that tells him &#34;I am thou,&#34; and a card magically appears in his hand. &#34;Per, so, na!&#34; Upon yelling the words, a warrior appears above Yu's head, and with its sword it slices the shadow's to bits. Yu had gained the power of &#34;Persona,&#34; the ability to summon your inner self.<br /><br />Now with the power to use persona, Yu dives into the TVs to save the poor lost souls who show up on the Midnight Channel. As the months go by, more people become kidnapped, Yu and Co dive into the TV world, they use their personas to fight the shadows, and help each victim face their inner self. Upon facing their inner self, that victim also gains the power of persona, and joins Yu in the search for the truth. Just who is behind these murders? Why are they throwing people into the TV? Just what is Teddie? What are shadows? Why does the Midnight Channel show the victim even before they enter the TV? Why is there even a world inside the TV? How come Yu gained his power before facing his shadow? Is he different? The town of Inaba is filled with mysteries, and it is your job to get to the bottom of it. All while still being a high school student!<br /><br />School Life:<br /><br />The gameplay of Persona 4 Golden is split up into two main sections, and because of that I'll be discussing each aspect of the gameplay separately. The first part of Persona 4 is your everyday school life. This section of the game plays a lot like a visual novel mixed with a dating sim or life sim. Since the game takes place over a year, you actually do go through most of the days. Now sure, at times there will be small time skips (such as during midterms and finals), but for the most part you really do spend a full year in Inaba.<br /><br />Normally your schedule will be as followed. Monday through Saturday Yu will wake up and go to school. On the way to school you may see a cutscene with him walking there, and along the way Yu may talk to one of his friends, or overhear something from other students. After that is class time. Although most of the time you won't even see the class, sometimes an important topic will be brought up, or you'll be asked a question in class. If you answer one of these questions correctly, your stats will increase. Once class is over, you then enter the &#34;after school&#34; part of the day, and the entire world is open to you!<br /><br />After school you can basically do anything, and there is a LOT to pick from. Whatever action you do will advance the time to evening, and that is why it is important to plan out what you want to do for that day. You can hang out with one of your friends, go to the movies, study in the library, work at one of the part time jobs, go to one of the school clubs you may have joined, and so on. There are also some activities you can do which will not advance time such as doing side quests, talking to NPCs, buying stuff at the store, buying books, etc. Either way, there are a lot of things you can do after school, and they all help you in different ways; although Social Links are the main parts of it.<br /><br />In Persona 4 you can become friends with your classmates, or other people around town, and this comes in the form of social links. By hanging out with people after school, you will build up your friendship, and that will in return help you in battle. While becoming closer with your party members may unlock special skills and abilities for them, hanging out with people in general will help you with your personas. By having stronger social links you can create stronger personas, and that really helps out in the long run.<br /><br />As I said before, doing well in class will increase your stats, but that isn't the only way to increase them. By eating food, doing jobs, and reading books, you can increase your other &#34;social skills&#34; as well. These social skills will allow you to do different things, based on what level you have them at. For example if you're brave enough, you could tell your teacher off in class, or if you're a very understanding person you can help tutor a student. Getting your skills up gives you more options to say to your friends to help build your friendship faster as well, so its always a good idea to get them as high as possible.<br /><br />After you have did your one &#34;main action&#34; of the day, the game will then advance to the evening section of the day. Now in the evening you'll sometimes start out by watching a cutscene (usually you'll be eating with Nanoko or watching the news to find out about the latest events and the weather), but after the scene is over you can do whatever you want. Although in the original Persona 4 you were limited on what you can do, in Golden you can actually go out into the city at night.<br /><br />At night Inaba is a slightly different place. The store becomes a bar (which you can also work at), you can visit the shrine to make a wish and become closer to people faster, you can sometimes meet up with friends who'll discuss the latest events in the story (also it'll make them closer to you), you can go night fishing, you can catch bugs at night, there are quite a few night jobs you can take (such as working at the hospital), or you could always return home and do some things there. At your house you can make models, make box lunches to eat with friends the next day, you can do other forms of part time work from home, you can read books (which will increase stats or give you new abilities), or you can even study for school. You really have quite a lot of options at night, but even so a lot of the cities areas are limited. While in the day you can travel allover, at night you are stuck mainly at the shopping district.<br /><br />Although for the most part you'll have complete control over what you do, there are special events that happen during the year that you must attend to. You'll go on school trips (which are normally quite funny), go on vacations with friends, go to special events, hang out on holidays, or even be forced to take exams at school. These sections of the game give you little tono control, and are completely story based. Still they help break up the daily grind, they add in comedy, and help pull you into this world even more.<br /><br />As you manage your daily live and investigate the murders, you can also preform one other major action which leads us to the second main part of the game. By going to Junes during the day, you can enter the TV world, and begin the RPG aspect of Persona 4 Golden.<br /><br />The TV World and Personas:<br /><br />While in the TV World, the game turns into a dungeon crawler. You will form a party of 4 characters, pick an area to go into, and begin exploring. Each area is simply just hallways and doors, but they do have their own themes, and enemies to encounter. Enemies will show up on the map as black shadows, and by hitting them with your sword first you can gain the upper hand in battle.<br /><br />While in battle you'll have the choice to either directly control your other party members, or let the computer take care of it, and you will also have a verity of options to help plan out your attacks. Although you can simply hit &#34;attack&#34; to bash an enemy with your weapon (Yu's is a sword), this isn't always the best option. The real main aspect of battles is the personas themselves, and it is up to you to figure out how to use them best. Each persona has their own abilities and stats, and Yu has the ability to switch between personas during battle. This is something you'll want to do quite often, and for very good reason. The entire goal while fighting in this game is to actually knock every single enemy over so you can pull off an &#34;All Out Attack.&#34;<br /><br />Every enemy in the game has a weakness, and by exploiting that weakness you will knock them over, and gain an extra turn. For example, say you're fighting against three enemies who are weak to electric type attacks. Well, Yu's default persona is electric type, and he has an electric attack called &#34;Zio.&#34; By using Zio you'll be ableto knock over an enemy, gain another turn, use Zio to knock over the second enemy, gain another turn, then use it gain for a final time to knock the last one down. Once this happens you can press the X button to pull off the All Out Attack, and flat out destroy everyone. This is the basics of the battle system, and to fully use it you will have to switch around your personas. Still, this is only the half of it.<br /><br />The personas themselves are a very complex system, and it takes some time to learn. Although you can randomly get more personas at the end of each battle, the main way to get them is by going into the velvet room (which you can access from both the real world and tv world), and fusing your personas together. By fusing two or more personas, you can create a completely brand new persona that will receive skills from the two you used to make it, as well as level up based on your social link bonuses. These personas are stronger than what you would normally find, and by fusing you can create personas with the skills and attacks you want them to have. You can also get skill cards to use on them by fighting enemies, but skill cards are rare, and its even rarer to get the one that you actually need/want.<br /><br />Leveling up in Persona 4 Golden is the final main feature of the game's RPG elements, and it is also a system which is a little bit different from most RPGs. As you fight and kill enemies, your character (Yu) will level up, but so will the persona he has equip at the time. While leveling up Yu will increase his HP, and SP (which personas spend when they use their special attacks), it also allows Yu to hold more personas at one time. Other than that no other stats increase on Yu (or the other characters), and the only way to make him stronger is buy buying better armor or weapons. The personas on the other hand, their stats DO increase. Each time a persona levels up, they become stronger, their attacks do more damage, and they learn new skills touse. Leveling your personas becomes a very important part of the game, and will be how you'll get stronger.<br /><br />While actually exploring the areas, running through halls, and opening doors is pretty basic (and can become repetitive), the battles and personas help keep the RPG action fun, and it never really drags on for too long. Each area is actually pretty short, only taking an hour or so to complete. If you're the type of person who hates dungeon crawling, you really don't have to worry in this one. By rushing through it, these areas only take up about 10% of the game, but if you actually like that sort of thing, you can easily spend as much time in them as you want.<br /><br />The Music and Style of P4G:<br /><br />Once in awhile in my reviews I'll bring up something outside of the main features. This &#34;something&#34; is normally a feature or aspect that really just stood out in the game, and helped give it it's charm. For Persona 4 Golden, that would have to be its music, and overall style.<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden uses a style that really makes the game pop. It is filled with bright anime styled graphics, detailed anime mugshots, it is filled with Japanese themes, and the music really stands out. The first time you go into a battle and hear &#34;Reach Out to The Truth,&#34; you will be shocked! Every song in the soundtrack just fits the game' so well, and it all really helps set the mood. The game features anime styled comedy to give you a few good laughs, and there's a wide verity of extras added exclusively to Golden. You can watch live persona concerts, watch Japanese trailers for the games, listen to the game's soundtrack, view art galleries, and even play a bonus trivia game. The extras are a really nice addition, and I often found myself going back to them just to rewatch a cutscene, or listen to one of the game's tracks.<br /><br />If you're a fan of modern day anime, Persona 4 Golden will really stand out to you. Like I said before, everything about the game just &#34;pops,&#34; and it is filled with memorable moments.<br /><br />The Good and the Bad:<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden isn't a game that everyone will like, but if you own a Vita and like JRPGs or even Visual Novels, it is a MUST have! The game's story is great, you will fall in love with the characters, the combat is fast and fun, fusing personas can become addicting, the music is great, and you will just be flat out hooked from start to finish. Really the game doesn't have any bad points, and is one of them few games I can review and say it is truly perfect for what it is. The only real issue with the game is the fact that its a dungeon crawler with hallway after hallway to explore, but then again a lot of people out there love that. On top of all of that, Persona 4 Golden was designed in a way so that EVERYONE could enjoy it, and that comes with a wide verity of difficulty modes. While the easiest mode lets you retry battles you die (your characters are revived with full health while the enemy retains the damage they received), the hardest mode is there to really push you and give you a challenge.<br /><br />If you have a Vita, and you like this sort of game, this is one you just CANNOT pass up! It has quite a lot of features the original PS2 version didn't have, and it even has a longer story mode featuring new areas and story arcs not originally seen. Even if you played the game before, you really have nothing to lose by getting Golden. Even when you finish the game it makes you want to come back for more, so you might as well come back to Golden. It really is, well, golden!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is one that you will almost never get tired of. Also the fact that it is free. makes it one of my favorites.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|In the sea of Nintendo DS games, it is very rare for you to come across one of them hidden gems. A lot of the lesser known DS games are normally known has shovel ware, and a lot of the time they just aren't worth it. Back when 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors came out not many people really knew what it was. Here was this game called &#34;999&#34; with a box art style that looked like Marvel vs Capcom 2's artwork, and it had anime characters on the front. Just, what is this game? And why is it M rated? Is it just another one of them cheaply made DS games? There's are just some of the questions people might have asked themselves when they first saw this game on the shelf, and chances are they would have just walked away; however in the off chance that they did decide to give it a try, they would then find themselves being sucked into one of the best games the DS has to offer.<br /><br />The thing about 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors (999 for short) is that it IS in fact a hidden gem on the DS! While a lot of people may have just pushed it aside, others who actually knew about the game would do whatever they could to get their hands on a copy of it. But, just what is this game? Why did people want it so badly? Well, for anyone who had been following the game's development, that answer is quite clear.<br /><br />999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors is a visual novel developed by Chunsoft, and that alone made it worth it for a lot of people! Although Chunsoft is best known in the west for developing the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, they are also known in Japan for developing some of the greatest visual novels, and for creating some of the best stories (428: In a Blockaded Shibuya being one of them, which later was turned into the anime Canaan). For a Chunsoft visual novel to be released in the US is just about completely unheard of, and it truly is a big deal. Still, what is 999, and is it really all that great? Well...<br /><br />The Story of 999:<br /><br />9 Hours, 9 Persons,9 Doors is in fact a visual novel, and because of that it's story plays a MAJOR role. The game starts up with a 21 year old man named Junpei waking up in a very strange room. There are bunk beds all around him, there's a giant door with a red number 5 painted on it, and really can't remember what has happened to him. At first Junpei simply takes a look around the room to try and see if he can figure out where he is, but soon things take a turn for the worst, and Junpei soon finds himself fighting for his life. As he looks over and notices the round window on the wall, he slowly begins to realize he is on a ship, and one that is about to sink at that. Soon the window cracks, water flows into the room, and Junpei begins to search the room to find a way out. This is when he finally remembers what happened to him.<br /><br />After returning to his apartment late at night, Junpei noticed that his window was strangely left open. At first he really doesn't think too much of it and simply closes it, but that's when it happened. Junpei turned around only to find a strange person in a black coat, with a gas mask, and a white can spewing smoke at his feet. Soon after Junpei passed out, and woke up a few hours later in the room he now stands in.<br /><br />Knowing that he didn't have much time to think about what happened to him, Junpei then continues to search the room to find a way out. He really didn't know what he was looking for, but after noticing a card scanner on the wall, he began to slowly work his way through a series of puzzles in hopes of opening that number 5 door. After a few minutes of searching, and puzzle solving, Junpei finally escaped the room, and then made a mad dash down the hall to &#34;safety.&#34;<br /><br />Once Junpei reached the end of the hall, he opened a door, and then found himself in a huge bright room with a large stair case in front of him. This is when he finally came to understand just what was going on. Much to Junpei's surprise, eight other people were coming down the stairs, including Junpei's long lost childhood friend Akane. As Junpei just stands there in shock, and as he wonders why his childhood friend was there, a voice then comes over the loud speakers. The man over the loud speaker goes on to explain that the nine people have been chosen to take part in a little game; the &#34;nonary game.&#34;<br /><br />The rules of the game were simple; everyone has a watch with a number on it, and there are 9 doors. They all have 9 hours to use their watches to open each of these doors, find the number 9 door, and to finally escape; however only 3-5 people can go through a door at a time, and if you break the rules, you die. To open each door, and to make it through each door and live, 3-5 people had to put their hands on a scanner, and if their number's digital roots added up to the door number, they could then enter; however once entering they would also have to find a second scanner to deactivate a bomb which was apparently inside of each person. If the people who went through the door failed to reach the second scanner within 90 seconds, they died.<br /><br />After hearing the announcement made by the man who called himself &#34;ZERO,&#34; the group of 9 people began to discuss their next move. Would they go along with Zero's game, or would they find another way out? None of them really knew quite what to do, but one thing was very clear; if they wanted to make it out alive, they would have to work together.<br /><br />Since no one really knew how much Zero knew about each of them, each person in the room decided to give themselves a code name to prevent Zero from knowing their true identity; after all Zero could have just kidnapped them all at random. By looking at each of their watches, each person decided to go under a name which would directly relate to their number. The older man with a number 1 watch decided to go by the name Ace, the number 2 blind man chose the name Snake, the young white hair man with a number 3 picked Santa, the young number 4 girl chose Clover, Junpei (who was number 5) kept his name since he already said it out loud, Akane (who was number 6) became June, the number 7 man decided to simply be Seven, the female dancer who was number 8 became Lotus, and the 9th man stayed the 9th man.<br /><br />Soon after everyone picked their code names, the 9th man pulled a knife on Clover, and forced her to put her hand up against the scanner by the large number 5 door that was in front of them. After forcing another person to put their hand on the scanner, he then scanned his own hand, and stepped through the door while leaving the others behind; however, this was to his own demise. Once the 9th man entered the door, his watch began to beep, and soon after an explosion could be heard. The 9th man had broken the rules of the game, and because of this he was punished.<br /><br />Now with one man dead, the other 8 people slowly started to realize that Zero truly wasn't joking around. The only way to survive was in fact to play his game, and they had to play it right. So, with that, the remaining people broke up into two teams, placed their hands on the scanners next to the number 5 door, and the number 4 door next to it. Both doors opened, both teams stepped inside their respective doors, and the nonary game officially started.<br /><br />The Mystery and Endings of 999:<br /><br />Unlike most games, 999 isn't simply a game you will play from start to finish and never go back to. The game is filled with many different options to pick from, and each of these options will actually take you down a different path in the story. For example at very start of the game, before the game actually starts, you are given the option to pick between entering the number 5 door where the 9th man's corpse could be found, or you could enter the second door with a number 4 on it. Depending on which door you pick, you'll go with different team members, solve different puzzles, and see different parts of the story; however it just doesn't stop there. Not too long after your initial choice, you are presented with another, and another, and another. At each of these choices the paths become split, and because of that you will WANT to keep replaying this game.<br /><br />999's story is actually filled with mystery, and you will need to see the entire game to unravel it. While at first you may simply be playing to escape the ship and survive, but soon you'll find yourself actually questioning where you are and what you are doing. What IS the nonary game? Why were these characters chosen to be a part of it? What is with this ship? This room, it's just a 1st class cabin right? Or does it actually serve a purpose? This game actually makes you question just about everything, and the more you play it the more you will actually come to understand just what 999 really is. While in one story path you might learn one thing, you might actually learn another fact which is related during another story path, and then you may learn something that ties both of the pieces of story you learned in the other two playthroughs in with the main game's story. Really it's kind of hard to explain, but to sum it up, each story path will offer different pieces to a much larger puzzle, which you will then figure out by the very end of the game.<br /><br />The entire story of 999, the way it's told, the alternate story paths, and the way it makes you question your actions is just something very unique, and something you don't see with most games today. It's a story that keeps you coming back for more, and it will shock you so many times that you truly will have no idea what to expect. While the game may be going in one direction at first, soon it makes 180 in the opposite direction, and then it does it again! By the end of each story path you will be questioning everything you know, and that's where 999 really shines. If you're confused already, well, welcome to the club!<br /><br />999 is also a very psychological game as well. Although the mystery of the main game will have you questioning yourself, the game's use of sound and description will start to get to you as well. The music changes to fit the mood of the different scenes, violence, although not actually shown on screen, is graphically detailed, and the creaking of the ship will constantly remind you that you're just hours away from dying. The entire atmosphere of this game will really draw you in, and it helps make it extremely enjoyable.<br /><br />The Gameplay:<br /><br />Although 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors is in fact a visual novel, which you'll spend most of the time reading, there's also portions of the game called &#34;escapes&#34; where you must solve puzzles to advance. These escapes happen after each numbered door you enter through, and they will test you as a player in MANY different ways.<br /><br />Escape portions play out like old PC adventure games where you'll have access to a few different rooms, and by clicking on different objects with the stylus you can search them; however it really isn't that simple. During your escape different characters will comment on different objects you search, and sometimes offer you hints on what to do next, but for the most part you have to figure things out on your own.<br /><br />Even though 999 is rated M due to its violence, and strong language, the puzzles in this game really aren't puzzles most kids will be able to solve. Even if a kid were to get a hold of this one and play it, chances are they would become stuck within the first few minutes. For example early on in the game you have to create a home made bomb to escape a room, but how do you do that? Sure the characters in game will give you hints, but if you really don't think about the tools you have at your disposal, you'll never escape. The nonary game itself is also based around what is known as a &#34;digital root&#34; as well. For anyone who doesn't know,a digital root is what you get when you add numbers together, and then add the second digit to the second to get a final single digit number. For example 4 + 6 + 7 = 18, and 1 + 8 = 9, therefore the digital root of 4, 6, and 7 would be 9. The game also later goes on to use other numbering systems to solve puzzles as well, such as hexadecimal.<br /><br />999 is one of them rare puzzle games that will test you in many different ways, and also force you to call up a lot of them pointless facts you may have buried in the back of your mind. The puzzles are challenging, yet fun, and the feeling you get from completing them is the best reward possible.<br /><br />The Good and the Bad:<br /><br />I am going to just flat out say it; 999 does NOTHING wrong, and it does EVERYTHING right! The game design is flawless, the story is one of the most creative stories you'll find on the DS, the puzzles are great, and it's one of them games that will keep you coming back for more! There's even a special section on the official website to help clear up any unanswered questions! Still, not everyone likes this sort of thing...<br /><br />The only bad points about this game is that not everyone will like it. If you don't like reading, you don't like visual novels, you hate solving puzzles, and you don't like slow moving games, you should stay far FAR away from this one. It is in fact a visual novel, and there's no voice acting at all. For the most part you will be looking at backgrounds, and you will read about what is going on.<br /><br />If you like visual novels, or just good stories in general, GET 999 NOW! It's one of them games you don't want to miss out on. The good news is, as of the time of this review (1/4/13) the sequel has already been released, and the original has received a reprint as well (which makes it a lot easier to find)!<br /><br />Overall, I give 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors for the Nintendo DS a 10/10.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Wow.  I read this within 2 days and just..<br />I don't want it to end.<br />I NEED A SEQUEL. PLEASE.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|I'll be honest, I am no opera expert. Actually I don't really know anything about operas. But I always wanted to watch this to see the source behind the music that plays on the radio in CS_Italy. I was not disappointed, what a stellar performance! Recommended to Counterstrike fans everywhere.
0920668372|5.0|This book will leave you with at least one tear in your eye.  A lovely story of the &#34;circle of life&#34;.  I used to read this to my son and it was a special book for us.
076115678X|5.0|This book is worth buying especially if you are new to the curly crew. A lot of good information in this book.
0062059963|2.0|Really, how does this book have so many positive reviews? I'm not that hard to please, but this was just terrible! The first book was good, in my opinion, because America was a stronger character and wasn't swooning all over Maxon. In this book, she was just plain whiney and dumb. And absolutely zero happens. Nothing more happens with the rebels in terms of giving us an idea of why they are attacking, and the book doesn't address any real issues. I am so disappointed!

B007T967X4|4.0|I was curious to try this app and found it to be simple to use.  I think it would help someone who isn't familiar with the notes of the treble clef (although hard to judge for certain, as someone who learned to read music during early childhood and can't even remember how I was taught).<br /><br />It taught one note at a time, and then added one additional note at a time until you were listening to three or four different notes (one at a time in random sequence).  You tap the screen in recognition of the correct note.  Tap each time you hear F while listening sequentially to notes that are either E, F or G.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app to read my Kindle books on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  It works great, and the screen on my smartphone turns into a smaller Kindle - complete with Carousel.  I have switched devices while reading books and can quickly return to the farthest read location.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a very cool good. I still can't leave it alone, its a game you most have.<br /><br />my 7 year old daughter play so much she even better then me lol
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Seems better than the first. I love it.  More things to do. The coal cart is really different. Gems are a lot of work.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Very cool. You get to be Iron Man and get the bad guys. What's not to like about that? Fun game!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|A true genius of artistic creation. Not a word is spoken, leaving your minds adult and child alike to fill in all the blanks with your very own story. A little boy eagerly anticipating the first big snow of the season goes to bed and wakes in the morning to a white world, he builds a snowman, the snowman comes to life and oh the adventures they have. Enyas' music as the snowman and boy fly by snowman power over oceans, mountains, valleys, cities, icebergs  and over whales and steamships adds a wonderful magic to the  feel of the whole show.  Classic must have DVD.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|very easy to carry when you are out or in the house, you save alot if you buy big boxes of wipes!!!<br />Very practical , easy to clean easy to open.<br />I definitly recomend it
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I have 2 dark steps that are very hard to see at night. I bought it for when I let the dog out at night. It is perfect for it. It picks up movement about 3-4 feet away. It is more than bright enough. It only stays lit for about 15 seconds after no movement too so it's not burning up the batteries.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|Um, I watched it so I wouldn't be clueless when I went to see 3. It served its purpose. Not an excellent it bad movie, I could barely stay awake at midnight while watching it. 1 is far better. 3 is about the same
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I do not like FREE games that force me to log into Facebook in order to play.  When I downloaded this game, there was no mention that a Facebook account would be required to play.  I feel like I was scammed.

140053271X|5.0|i love this nook because unlike other nooks its just a book soo it helps me stay focus and my readinggrade went up from a 70 2 a 93
B00ABKGG0C|2.0|This is the first book I've ever purchased because it showed up in my \\"recommended\\" list that has so many 5 star reviews.  I'm usually suspicious when the reviews so overwhelmingly endorse the greatness of a book.  After Blood Song, - speaking for myself- I was right to be suspicious.<br /><br />While Blood Song is not horrible -I probably would've slid it 3 stars had I finished- I'm totally clueless as to how it earned so many 5 stars. Granted, I'm long past the age where I enjoy coming-of-age stories, if I ever did like them much.  So maybe that's the reason I don't understand why Blood Song is getting so much love.<br /><br />I read about 60% of the book, and it still seemed like it was in the prolog. I get-it that the harsh military training the characters endure is a big part of the story, but does it have to be so much of it? Call me cynical, but I got tired real quick of all the sob stories. Enough of the poor little boys abandoned by their parents already; this ain't Orphan Annie.  And OK, it's pretty clear these 6th Order fellas are supposed to be all bad@$$. I just don't need to know every detail of what it takes to earn their Eagle Scout badges.<br /><br />There is a good story in here somewhere -I did enjoy the parts that were in the present.  It's just buried under all the \\"writing\\". The dialog isn't very realistic and the story comes across as planned-out instead of flowing.<br /><br />All due respect to Mr. Ryan; I apologize for being a hater, but there is just nothing special enough about Blood Song  to hold its own against all the other good fantasy books that are currently out there. Ryan definitely has potential, but Blood Song isn't there yet.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Originally I rented this movie because it looked like it would be mildly entertaining and I could use it for background noise. To my surprise it was actually a very refreshing movie that was quite entertaining. I ended up forgetting about what I was working on just to watching this movie. The best part about this movie is the simplicity. It is well beyond some of the crap that's put out there and was driven by good actors.
B007SGM084|4.0|I Really Liked The Books, But Boy the story Is highly exaggerated By people. I didn't think it was that dark and crazy.<br />it was very upsetting not to ever get to hear Christian's point of VIew.  this book Should be written in Christian's point of view.I I'd Buy it again.
1594746168|2.0|The illustrations and plates in this book are wonderful, and the book is aesthetically lovely.  However, the short \\"biography\\" of the fictitious Dr. Spencer Black was more than I could handle.  At only 65 pages, you'd think I could manage it, but I threw up my hands (and almost my lunch) around page 46.<br /><br />I'm usually game for something fairly grisly, and didn't have a problem (or so I thought) reading about grave robbers, \\"resurrectionists,\\" of the 19th century.  Smelly old corpses being exhumed and stolen in the middle of the night - hey, no problem.<br /><br />But I absolutely cannot read about vivisection.  When I got to the part about crazy Dr. Black's experiments in that arena, I couldn't go on.  Yes, I know it is fiction, this particular tale, but it is so very deeply disturbing to me that I am going to have trouble washing the images out of my mind.  And this is with not finishing the book.  Perhaps people with stronger stomachs than mine will do better with it, but I can't imagine anyone short of a serial killer in training actually enjoying it.<br /><br />Five stars for the creativity and artistry of the illustrations, but all the good is negated by the writing.<br /><br />I was given a copy of this book for review.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|This is a great read but may be hard to understand or apply if you're shy or new at sales. For intermediates or experts, however, this is a veritable handbook on advanced sales
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's fun but a little repetitive, I guess. However, it's good for a bus ride. Decent graphics. Not sure the size of it is worth keeping on a tablet that can't have it's memory increased.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|It is a very good CD collection. If you appreciate Pink Floyd this is the wright collection to have, specially if you are planing to have a long trip by car.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|J.J. Abrams, who very successfully rebooted the long-dormant STAR TREK franchise in 2009, stated that he wanted to make a TREK film that wasn't exclusively for TREK fans. He wanted to make a film that anyone could get on board with the new crew of the USS Enterprise and enjoy just as much as longtime fans of the show and the previous films. It worked extremely well as an extremely entertaining and rollicking piece of summer entertainment, and not only was pleasing to those longtime fans, but brought in new fans as well. Now, Abrams is doubling down on the existing fans of the Star Trek Universe and still looking to bring in new fans with STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, which is such a breathtaking piece of stellar entertainment that it stands currently as the film to beat for this summer.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's hard to review this film without spoiling a myriad of plot points, but I'll do my best to avoid that. The film opens with all of our crew members returning to the Enterprise: Chris Pine as James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as \\"Bones\\" McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty are all back and they're trying to save a planet from its own destruction, but Kirk violates Starfleet's infamous Prime Directive in saving Spock. This gets Kirk busted down by Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood, also reprising) to his first officer and Spock reassigned to another ship. But a terrorist explosion in London at a Starfleet facility carried out by rogue Starfleet officer John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch, most famous for his work as the titular detective in BBC's SHERLOCK) forces the upper echelon of Starfleet captains into a military operation, overseen by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), to take down Harrison. A horrific attack brings Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew, including a new science officer, Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), into conflict with Harrison and his plans for his revenge on Starfleet, which quickly escalates beyond what they would have imagined, and not every crew member will be returning from this voyage.<br /><br />Abrams, and writers Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof (most of these are part of Abrams' crew, working on some of his television shows like LOST, FRINGE and ALIAS, as well as some of his other films like MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III and the previous TREK film) are not reinventing the wheel here with INTO DARKNESS, but they are making that wheel turn at a frenetic and not frantic speed. All of the action and set pieces are huge and are tremendously exciting (particularly a sequence where a badly-damaged Enterprise is plummeting towards Earth being probably the highlight, but it's hard to say which is the most exciting) and it's clear that the films of Abrams' youth of the late 70's and early 80's, particularly films by Steven Spielberg (to whom he made the brilliant love-letter to in 2011's SUPER 8), have heavily influenced this film in how it moves and how it feels. The film has a breakneck pace that few of the more recent tentpole releases have had, but when it does need to slow down, it makes all it can of those scenes. And here, not only do the action sequences dazzle from a technical standpoint, there is a reason for them to be taking place both from a story and especially from a character point of view. There aren't many plot contrivances here that just propel the action forward and don't serve a need of character or story elements, which was something I felt seriously hindered the other big summer release so far, the tepid IRON MAN 3. Another standout here is the brilliant score from returning composer Michael Giacchino, who has become Abrams' John Williams here, rising the highs and sombering the lows of the story with his work.<br /><br />The returning cast once again do an excellent job filling their roles on the Enterprise, with each character getting a severely kick-ass moment in the narrative, but from an Enterprise perspective, as is usually the case, this film is very much about Kirk and Spock and their bromance, which is a mix of antagonism and deep caring. However, this film, if it's anyone's, it's Cumberbatch's performance that keeps you on your toes and keeps you transfixed. It's a performance of absolute superiority, not only in a character-related sense, but just the skill in which he envelops himself with his perfect diction, his physicality, and his sense that he's not the bad guy here, because no good villain thinks they're a villain. He does what he thinks is right, and what he knows to be superior to anyone else's goals. Just barely running second to Cumberbatch though is once again Quinto, who was the standout of the first film as well as Spock. He treads a careful line between his half-human/half-Vulcan sides, and this is the first time in this series of feature-length films where we see, at times, a much more emotional side of Spock, and it ultimately makes for a more compelling character as well as a much more fulfilling performance. Don't get me wrong; I love Leonard Nimoy as Spock, but I never felt that he could do more like I feel with Quinto. The only cast member that feels short-changed here is newcomer Eve (who sadly has been in some truly abysmal films such as SEX AND THE CITY 2 and THE RAVEN), because other than being someone who is obviously important in the series' mythology, she doesn't really have a lot to do.<br /><br />It's hard to keep the secrets that constantly cloak the productions of J.J. Abrams when you're reviewing one of his works, but I find that if you just stick to the basics, you can avoid things that people want to go in fresh to. The only thing I will state here is that, like in the first film, there's a lot of fan service to some of the bigger films of the original crew's films, but even moreso in this film. Some have called this film a \\"remake\\", which it most decidedly is not despite there being similar situations and even a strange mirror-universe restaging of one of the more famous scenes in the series, and the reason it's not a remake is because of that whole mirror-universe alternate-timeline that Abrams so refreshingly set the stage for in the first film of the reboot. That gives the narrative of this series a very unpredictible sensibility. There were moments I didn't see coming at all, and what's more is that no one crew member ever seems safe to return for the next film. Abrams really risks running the ire of fans with this series and probably even moreso with this film, but so far, it seems to be paying off in spades.<br /><br />If 2009's STAR TREK was that summer's IRON MAN, than Abrams' INTO DARKNESS is very much 2013's AVENGERS. It's a mighty film with an epic scope, great performances, great humor and a satisfaction that only the best of the summer blockbusters can give and will be very difficult to surpass on that level of sheer entertainment.tive, as is usually the case, this film is very much about Kirk and Spock and their bromance, which is a mix of antagonism and deep caring.

B000F8O35U|1.0|This DVD was shipped directly to my granddaughter. She is 3. The dissapointment when this did not work was not a good experience. My daughter has shipped back for a refund which we surely deserve.  It is inappropriate to sell defective products at any time but to a child? Unforgivable.
B00786XVOG|5.0|Saw this an Public TV station and enjoyed it very much.  I was pleased when Amazon sent me an email which included a number of Yanni CDs.  I was very excited to not only find this one but others that I have been searching for in music stores and any store that carries CDS. I was surprise to find the DVD that I had enjoyed so much on TV was the exact same one.If there is nothing on TV, which is often, I will put on Yanni CD and now have the choice of either listening to the CD or watching the DVD.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Great songs, great music, an all around good listening album.  Looking forward to more in the future.  Keep it up.
B00CHG10SQ|3.0|On the Editorial Review for this CD it states that you are getting \\"My Future\\" as bonus track 11, that is not true. Track 11 on this CD is \\"New Song\\". My husband requested this CD just for the \\"My Future\\" which is one of his favorite songs by Amorphis and is very disappointed that we spent the money on something that he will not enjoy as much. He does like \\"New Song\\" but that is not what he was paying for.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci has done it again. Great reading and intrigue. Twists around every corner. Cannot wait to read the next novel.
B004GYY714|5.0|It works pretty much as I expect.  It's nice to have a favorites list, so I don't have to find my channels again.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Sad, but heartwarming in the end. Makes you realize that someone you know may have had a much harder life than you could ever imagine.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|It's awesome.  I use it anytime I walk into a new place.  It helps find a SSID when the homeowner doesn't know it.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Love her music. You just sit back, relax and enjoy. Great guitar playing and singing. Songs are great to listen to.
1616550414|5.0|Plain and simple, if you are a Zelda fan, you have to have this book. Beautiful art, in depth history, and even a manga!
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I've enjoyed his more recent books, but had not read this one. I couldn't put it down -- what a thriller.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I love Star Wars. I love Angry Birds. It makes sense that I would like Angry Birds: Star Wars. The only problem I have with it is that the game required you pay for the additional 'Path of the Jedi' levels.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This is the first CD of his that I've gotten. I will definitely get more of his music, including past CDs.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I like this one almost as much as I like Angry Birds Star Wars. The gravity mechanics are probably my favorite part.
B00BOXZAJ8|4.0|This story is a unique one in deed. Two worlds on the same axis with different gravities as well as cultural and resource differences. Two people in love breaking these boundaries to be together.<br />Storyline is good.Visual is outstanding.  Makes one see and realize just how difficult it would be to live in a demension such as the one in the movie.<br />You'll have to watch this sifi love story to at least be very impressed.<br />This was produced in 2011.Very surprised that marketing was not as impressive.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|This is the second collaboration between Berth Hart and Joe Bonamassa following their successful first outing titled 'Don't Explain'. This new collaboration CD release titled 'Seesaw' (11 tracks) is a wonderful mellow bluesy interpretation of old time classics/favourites by legendary singers such as Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Billie Holiday, Donnie Hathaway, Lucinda Williams, Buddy Miles, Tina Turna, Slackwax, Melody Gardot & Nina Simone. It's a great combination of Berth's soulful voice and the great bluesy guitar playing by the maestro that is Joe Bonamassa.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\" (a slow-tempo bluesy track with a great melody), \\"Can't Let You Go\\" (great guitar work & great duet singing), \\"If I Tell You I Love You\\" & \\"A Sunday Kind Of Love\\" (a cabaret-bluesy track with wonderful piano playing. Good track are \\"Them There Eyes\\" (the opening up-tempo cabaret singing track, a Billie Holiday 1939 classic), \\"Close To My Fire\\" (a jazzy track with great guitar work), \\"Nutbush City Limits\\" (up-tempo 1973 Ike & Turner classic), \\"Miss Lady\\" (a Buddy Miles classic), \\"Rhymes\\" & the pop-ish title track \\"See Saw\\". There is no weak track or CD filler.<br /><br />On overall, Berth Hart and Joe Bonamassa do not disappoint in this second collaboration cd titled 'Seesaw'.  A highly recommended CD listening.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read!<br />Really enjoyed the pace! Can't wait to read the next book! Glad I started reading the series! Enjoy!!!
B004NELBPC|5.0|I love this paper' it covers many subjects neglected elsewhere. I read it everyday as does my wife. Broad ranging and hits the highlights of American life.
B007SGM084|5.0|I finished the first book in less than 24 hours, and finished the series by the end of the week! I have since reread the series multiple times, and keep going back to it.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Too many tracks of 70's sounds and not enough of Daft Punk.  And far far far to many lyrical tracks.<br /><br />On past remix Daft Punk albums the input of other artists was appreciated but in this one pretty much every track that says Featuring _____ are songs we could do with out.  Pharrell Williams voice is thin and frail and even though Get Lucky is perhaps the most memorable single on this album, his lyrics and voice leave much to be desired and add very very little.<br /><br />I was mildly dissapointed with the Tron Legacy album and it's boring calculated songs for a bland movie.  This album was to me to be a return to Discovery and or Homework for me, and I have to say I wanted Daft Punk to return to it's roots but they shot past them all the way to the begining and that's a bit too much for me.
B009LDD4V4|4.0|I want to extend my congratulations to FOx productions for the splendid series \\"BONES\\".  I do not watch much commercial TV but this is an exception.  The programs include humour, some SCI FI, crime fighting, tear jerking scenes and sentimental stuff, all of which I like. Some splendid<br />episodes I especially liked: THE FUTURE IN THE PAST, THE BUT IN THE JOKE, THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE, THE CORPSE IN THE CANOPY, THE SHOT IN THE DARK, & especially THE DIAMOND IN  THE ROUGH where Booth and Brennan do a magnificent dance at the end of the episode.  Emily Deschanel has to be one of the<br />most beautiful women in the world, along with her wonderful sister Zooey.  The GHOST episode was very mystical along with the SHOT IN THE  DARK where<br />Brennan meets her mother.  Was it real or a figment of her mind? It was ironic that an atheist gave birth to her child in a Manger. (Accident?) Added the wonderful photography, sets and outstanding direction and this overall was (and is) the best program on TV.  I did not like the idea of Sweets moving into Booths and Brennans house.  I don't really care for him: He is like a man-child, constantly putting his foot in his mouth and comes off as a kind of mooch.  I wonder if his primary role is to be comedy relief along with Edison and Daisy whom I also dislike.  I understand that<br />Daley is primarily a writer: he should stick to that.  I heard he wrote for Jim Carey, another looser, whose only claim to fame is his big mouth.  Edison I don't like primarily because he made a number of inappropriate remarks about Brennans chest during her pregnancy and on serveral occasions.  I did not think it was funny; almost stereotyping Edison.  I bought the episodes for SEASON 8 from AMAZON into a video library; I hope however the DVD set is released soon.  I have the complete 1 thru 7 seasons that I purchased thru AMAZON and watch them often. There was supposed to be four more<br />episodes to make up for the shortened 7th season: where arethey? If they made them, they should show them during the summer to keep us boneites happy until the fall season.  Never-the-less long live BONES!! FOUR STARS +
B00498YZH8|5.0|I believe that this is the first feature film for Jennifer Lawrence. She is an enthralling central character. This movie kept me glued to the screen, watching scene to scene, waiting for the conclusion. A kind of dark story about the drug trade in back-woods southern USA, excellently written and preformed.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|Love me some WOTE.  Awesome cover band, extremely talented and very impressive original material, as well.  I wish them the most success.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Over the top...in a good way! Ms. Kinsella creates absurd situations, and somehow makes them work! There were many laugh out loud parts. This book was very funny and enjoyable.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|This music was bought for my friend he seemed to really enjoy it the music is soothing to the ears and they sing like angels.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael is great, and this cd does not disappoint.  He does some old classics, some new songs, but all are done well.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|At least on this recording some of the old school Mariah we came to love, you know the one that actually sings and not whisper tone all the time is back. Still not into the thuggish sounds so much but like her older stuff best.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|A thriller that thrills. Kept me reading and reading until the story was done. What happened???  You will only know if you read it. Read it.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Train Crisis HD y -  it is a fun game, however, it consumes battery quite fast (maybe because it's HD)
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Why does Martin waste so many words writing about food. I bet if you combine all the text about food in this entire series it would be about 500 pages.<br />This book was very average. Lots of wasted time waiting for something cool to happen.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie, lots of action. The actors played their roles really well.The overall content of the movie was very exciting.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|For sure the writing's beautiful. You slip right into the scenes, and live every moment through America's eyes. But some of those moments, some of the muddled plot, some of the character's decisions, hit me wrong. Spoiler Alert: Couldn't wrap my head around the fact that America would make-out with Aspen--although she's totally enamored with the Prince--and then totally go off on Maxon for doing the same thing with Celeste. And what about that bracelet? There's a lose end if there ever was one. She never fesses up about her sleazy indiscretion. And Maxon's excuse for getting his make-out session on was as lame as the storyline that his dad beats him. Kind of out of nowhere with no foreshadowing. None. Other details bothered me, but I'll end with this: Under Developed. That's the lasting impression.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I was very excited to watch with movie as both my husband and I are 40ish.  It was a very funny movie but the language was crazy horrible.  I certainly hope no-one in real life drops the f-bomb 30 times a day in front of the kids and doesnt expect them to talk like that too.  As with all &#34;funny&#34; movies the extreme is what gets the laughs, but really this movie went over the top with language and crudeness.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I wish this had a longer charge (and that it turned off automatically so it didn't burn out the batteries), and a bigger dust bin.  Those issues aside, I have 3 small children, and use this 2 or 3 times a day for crumbs.  I purchased an additional battery, but I find that the battery will last for a few days of sporadic use.<br /><br />I do have to empty it a few times if the kids are particularly messy, and I've had to clean the brushes off more than once, but they make it very easy to remove the plastic casing and get to the brushes, and sent a utensil designed to clean it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Very relaxing and addictive game. You definitely won't regret it if you buy it.<br /><br />I just can't stop playing it. \o
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is one of my favorite shows on tv, however I missed the end of season 3 due to work travels. Being able to watch the last episode on the kindle was great. Now I know how it ends and do need to wait a half year for AMC to replay it. Great show to add to you watch list if you are not already watching.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Game design and graphic are good. But could you add an offline mode between real people. Sometime server disconnect while i'm using stable wifi connection.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love Supernatural! Enjoy very much having the full seasons on dvd and plan to keep ordering each season as it becomes available
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Terrific!! Highly Recommend.  If you love series from the 1970's this is a must have and you cannot beat the price!!
0312370849|3.0|After reading this book, I wanted another read through. Unfortunately  it was a library book and there was a waiting list to get it out again.I found it on amazon for just a little more than the reserve price from the local library. Very pleased.
B001B1T7BU|4.0|This a good movie for the 3 to 9 year-old kids to see. Though I like the original animated one better.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|The songs are great on this CD.  Not very pleased to be told how many words are needed for my review!
B008011XQQ|5.0|There is not a song on this CD that my hubby and I do not love.  We listen to it when we want a quiet evening together, it is excellent road trip music, and please let me hear it at least once while driving the Pacific Coast Highway. Carlos Santana has never been anything less than at the top of his game and that has not changed with this wonderful addition to this music genius's<br />contribution to his lucky fans.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|This is my first Train CD and I really like it.  It's upbeat and I listen to it very often.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. you will be playing this for along time.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a fun app that me and my granddaughter can play together. Still haven't gotten through all the levels yet.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Buy this processor as I wanted to build two desktop pc, one for the living room and one for the playroom eventually this processor is for living, not complaining about it and not saying it's bad for the game, but I prefer an i7 for gaming, and more if its completion is in K since it is more stable for OC, this processor has excellent performance, there is an average difference of 2 nd generation east of the 3, if you want to build a pc the 3 B, good, nice and cheap, I recommend this processor, excuse my English I have not done the course XD
B001KZG99A|3.0|While the movie was not boring, but wasn't surely the best I saw.  I wanted to see this before I see Iron Man 3, so my feedback is based on viewing this in 2013 as opposed to when this was released
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the amazing relationship between Pi, the boy, and Richard Parker, the beautiful tiger, crafted over endless days in desolation when all they had was each other.  I have not seen the movie but I do intend to.  Somehow I already know that I will be disappointed as there is no possible way even the finest movie producer could capture the beautiful story that Mr. Martels brings to his readers.  This is a great read for young and old.
193700788X|5.0|Thank you to Charlaine Harris for YEARS of wonderful stories from Bon Temps. Other series authors have let their books diminish into a parody of their earlier successful work, thoroughly ticking off readers. (Yes, Ms. Evanovich, I'm talking to you.)  Ms. Harris allowed Sookie to grow and change over the years while maintaining the passion and action we came to expect.  I had an inkling of the ending (NO SPOILER I PROMISE) and was delighted to watch it unfold. I admire Ms. Harris for tying up the story lines, providing a satisfying ending and maybe even a happily ever after for our friend Sookie.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I enjoyed this book as well as the book prior to it . It was short and still a good read. I will be reading the rest in the series .
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|What took Universal so long to release this box set? Columbo has been and always will be one of the most iconic characters in television history. Emmy Award/Golden Globe Award winner Peter Falk (also a two time Academy Award nominee) was perfect as the rumpled, disheveled Lieutenant (no first name ever mentioned) Columbo. Making the criminal du jour believe he was a buffoon and incompetent moron, and that they were going to get away with the crime. While we the viewer knew from the outset that Columbo knew immediately who the culprit was. (To quote Ralph Kramden &#34;You know that I know that you know that I know&#34;). Columbo was also my father's favorite show of all times. We would watch it on Sunday afternoons on A&E or one of those cable stations, him in NY and me in FL and reminisce about the episode when we would speak later. Dad would have loved this box set especially as there doesn't seem to be room on cable for these type of shows anymore. Reality nonsense has taken over because it's cheap to make. And to think Bing Crosby was offered the role but turned it down. That was the best decision (for the fans) that &#34;Der Bingle&#34; ever made. The box set is also packed well in regular DVD cases with each disc on its own notch. And the price??? At $56.99 for 34 discs that averages out to about $1.68 per disc and with 69 episodes $0.87 per episode. While I would never condone internet pirating I almost feel like I did steal this (which of course I didn't). If you love Columbo then this is every fans dream collection. There are also a few episode's of &#34;Mrs. Columbo&#34; that starred Kate Mulgrew and ran for about 13 episodes. I will admit to never watching them before but I will watch the episodes in this collection with an open mind. Highly recommend to anyone who loves Columbo, but then, who doesn't? :-)
B005DC68NI|5.0|This book put a lot of things into perspective for me. The major times in my life when I have been paid for my writing were as a journalist working for newspapers. David Gaughran has laid out a clear path for me to ramp up my writing, once again. Having the Kindle app on my iPhone and iPad just puts me that much closer! Thank you!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Really nice app. Super cool that this was the FAOTD! Helpful for figuring out wood working measurements and doing my kids homework.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I skipped this in theaters because after BORAT I was pretty disgusted with this type of humor. The Dictator does not disappoint its just a bit raunchy but overall funny I highly recommend this film for a good laugh.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Having already moved to another country (4 times in 10 years) and having been brought up to follow Jesus' simple way of life as an example (ie staying out of debt and avoiding becoming tied down or attached to a home or certain possessions) I was under the impression I was doing okay at living simply. I bought this book for tips on keeping down the clutter in my life. I tend to accumulate tiny bits of clutter you see. After reading the book however I have come to see that there are more ways to living mindfully and simply than just staying out of debt and not owning my own house or setting out to fill it with &#34;possessions&#34;... Even mentally or emotionally one can clutter oneself up with endless to do lists or hobbies you never get round to or unorganised digital files and saved internet explorer bookmarks from 3 years ago that I will never look up again... Indeed there are many ways I can simplify myself I have gleaned from this book and not only has reading it informed and inspired me to do so it has also equipped me with countless practical tips and mindsets to have as I set about the task of &#34;travelling more lightly&#34; through life, and setting out to be someone who can feel fine about &#34;walking away empty handed&#34;.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This is a great book to use for learning new knots. Not your joy scouts knots. It provided easy to follow steps & great pictures.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Now that I have figured out how to play this game, I'm liking it a lot!!!!!! Keep them coming this girl is hooked for sure......
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|its a fun game to play. the hidden pica are a lot harder then most hidden games and the story line is great.
B00757J98K|4.0|Lets face it, Madonna succeeds with EVERYTHING she does. This is a great album! I gave it 4 stars just because she decided to collaborate with Nicki Minaj.
B00ADLCC9I|1.0|Bundle games are terrible and I found no use of console keys for any decent game... Rather buy regular tablets in better performance, especially the battery drains too fast.
B00516G6ME|4.0|This figurine is quite huge compared to the others, and yet the detail it contains is magnificent. From the colouring, to the size, to the weight, everything looks amazing.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie remastered for today's high definition televisions and DTS mastered audio.  It has the most to gain from being remastered of all the Terminator movies so it was a great value.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This amplifier works well.  My wife is hard of hearing and we attach this device to the output of flat screen tv then to her earphones.  She loves it.  Now she can hear everything in the movies.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|What the?...Skynet uploading data stream menu thing took forever (about 15 minutes). Who dropped the ball on that?  Once the movie finally started it is a great quality film.  The additional content was unnecessary and the mind blowing special effects are not as impressive as they once were, so I enjoyed the first remastered Terminator movie more because there was such an improvement in picture and sound quality.
0071771263|4.0|Like real test questions..<br />My friends advice to me to buy this book.<br />that is why I study this book.
6305075492|5.0|Upon it's initial release the film was called vulgar, juvenile, and disgusting. Well, I have some good news for you... it still is!<br /><br />The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari has an attitude problem. The film wants nothing more than to punch you right in the face. Visually extraordinary, stylistically legendary, and thematically revolutionary, The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari is one of the best and one of the very first horror films ever produced. And the film is psychologically insane. Modern storytelling isn't nearly this good.<br /><br />Robert Weine was an interesting figure in the history of film. Though he would never make something as triumphant as The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari ever again, he would still have moments of genius periodically throughout his later career. Most notably with The Hands Of Orlac in 1924, another picture starring Conrad Veidt, and though it is incredibly slow paced, The Hands Of Orlac is ultimately satisfying and rewarding. But it's The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari that I am here to appreciate. It is the performances of Werner Krauss and Conrad Veidt that I am here to remember and happily lull.<br /><br />Visually, The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari might be the most influential film ever made. I honestly doubt whether German Expressionism would have hit the western world the way that it did had it not been for Caligari. Metropolis certainly wouldn't have existed, Film Noir would not have developed in quite the same way, and modern filmmakers like Tim Burton and Guillermo Del Toro would be visionaries without a vision had it not been for Caligari.<br /><br />It is an incredible film, and I highly recommend it. Modern psych-thrillers don't even come close to matching Caligari's complex and completely absorbing tale of murder, insanity, and possession. The dynamic of substance and style are equally matched throughout the film. Cheers, Weine, for a film that will live forever!

B002U6DVQM|5.0|8½ is, unquestionably, one of my favorite films of all time. This film is a mad circus, a mediation on life and love, and the most deliriously perfect film on the face of the earth. In short, 8½ is the film equivalent of a baptism, each and every time I watch it I feel as though I am born again. Frederico Fellini's 8½ is not just a magical film, the film itself is magic. It is a film about the beauty in artistic confusion and misguided passions, told seemingly autobiographically from the point of view of Guido Anselmi, a popular film director who finds himself awash in creative disunion and romantic pandemonium. Throughout the film Guido seeks out solutions through increasingly bizarre bouts of sordid self reflection that manifests itself in fits of manic hysteria and surreal fantasies that conjure up the most perplexing of answers.<br /><br />Guido Anselmi is played by one of the finest of all the Italian actors, Marcello Mastroianni, and it is a performance for the history books. Mastroianni bridges the gap between film acting and true self-realization, just as director Frederico Fellini closes the gap between film and art, art and life, and life and dreams. This is a film that tries to communicate a great deal with its audience, therefore I find it best to go into 8½ as a dry sponge, eager to absorb all of the wonderful and fantastic ideas the film so eloquently and carefully bestows.<br /><br />8½ is truly a one-of-a-kind experience, and I believe it one of the most important films ever made. It is extremely difficult to be unmoved by this film. I find it deeply affecting, haunting even, but in a very warm, comforting, welcoming, and even forgiving way. The honesty of 8½ is unobscured by artistic and financial boundaries, as he explores not only the creative mind but the human spirit as well, and how these two things often war with each other. I recommend 8½ to anyone who has ever fallen in love with a film, hell, I actually recommend 8½ to anyone and everyone I know! I believe that everyone owes it to themselves to see this film. I believe that everyone should have the good fortune of experiencing of the greatest works of art that has ever been produced.<br /><br />I honestly cannot stress enough how remarkable 8½ truly is. There is not a single wasted frame of film in the whole piece. 8½ is a wonderful, hypnotic, and beautiful odyssey. 8½ is not just a film about film, it is a film about life.<br /><br />To sum up all that's been said, I'll just repeat the obvious: 8½ is one of my favorite films, and it is a very beautiful film. That is all.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|If you are collecting CD's for your music library, this CD of Paul Anka is a 'must have'! I highly recommend it to everyone.
193700788X|1.0|What a completely rubbish conclusion to a fantastic series. The most disappointing book I have read in a very long time! I felt cheated out of a happy or at least plausible ending with a book that had no romance, no character consistency and a convoluted plot that seemed to include all the minor characters of the past 12 books and disregarded all the major ones we've come to love.<br /><br />I mean please - Eric just gives in to Felipe without a fight, pushing Sookie aside like he hasn't spent all 12books trying to catch and then keep her; Sookie shrugs off Eric dumping her like a change of clothes in one night and then moves onto Sam whose thoughts apparently no longer bother her - she does this all in the space of the last few chapters I might add and really, her choice is Sam - how boring can you get and no build-up at all to their romantic (or lack of) relationship; Quinn drops by for a visit like there's no bad feeling between him and Sookie and; Amelia's Dad, who no-one knows or cares about suddenly becomes a main character. Then, there's the lack of vampires in the novel. Given the whole series is about the supernatural community of which the vampires play a large part suddenly we're back to the humans. Yawn.<br /><br />Basically this book was a very frustrating and extremely disappointing read which was a waste of my time and energy. I refuse to ever read this book again or think about it. What a waste of a storyline that could have ended in so many more exciting and interesting ways. I highly recommend that you do not read this book - EVER!
