B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had never heard of Wool until it was recommended by Amazon (the first time i actually liked an Amazon recommendation.) The story was fun to read; intriguing; well-written with no pretense.  I'm sucked in now.  Thank you.  I just wish I didn't read it so fast, so please write more!
0439023513|2.0|**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**  I came into reading Mockingjay with the knowledge that a lot of people found it disappointing, but I decided to read it anyway to see for myself, to see how the story ends and also because this trilogy has been a quick read. The beginning of the book involves a lot of reminders of what happened in previous books, which was kind of tedious to get through, but then once the story starts moving in this one I actually liked it. There is a decent amount of character development and descriptions of what is going on, where it's not just about everyone trying not to get killed. The depiction of various characters' mental breakdowns is well done, and I enjoyed reading about the preparations for going into the final battle.  But Mockingjay turns sour in Part III, the last third of the book. What had previously been a slower paced, fairly interesting story suddenly turns into a funhouse of horrors, where all these characters we'd finally been getting to know, along with a bunch of new characters we didn't know at all, die in all sorts of bizarre ways to the point where it's ridiculous. And if you thought Catching Fire was kind of cheap in how every chapter ended in a sudden cliffhanger and it seemed like the author was mostly just having fun thinking of novel ways to kill people, this one is worse. The deaths pile up quickly and get weirder and weirder until we get the giant horde of mutant lizards that go around decapitating everyone in sight. And then the cage of children gets blown up, but not before Katniss's sister happens to wander in there and she dies in a scene that had me going, \\"Wait, what?\\" and being so confused about this arbitrary sequence of events that I wasn't even sad about it.  The ending with Katniss's mother and Gale is disappointing in how it's basically non-existent. I had a hard time believing those two would just leave Katniss behind after everything, but then Katniss ends up with Peeta by default over the course of two pages that are so bland and generically written that they're completely devoid of emotion. I was glad that Katniss didn't end up in a position of power, because she really is just a kid, and by the end she's a permanently emotionally damaged kid. But the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying.
B005ER6SNM|1.0|I have mixed feelings about this movie.  On one hand - it was interesting to look into a world that most people are not privy to, on the other hand -it was the most disgusting and morally reprehensible piece of cinematic trash I've ever seen.  The thing that amazed me was the fact that this movie - had a plot and kept you watching until the bitter end. I will say that the ending seemed appropriate - I wanted to lie down and expire with them -it just seemed like the right thing to do after all that.I don't know that I'd recommend anyone watchig this - but I can't say it was a horrible movie -it was just horrible subject matter.  I give it points for probably being more realistic than we would ever want to have confirmed -but I can't give it 5 stars like it was some materpiece film that I'd watch again and again. This won't make you feel better about yourself -or other people after you watch it.  I'd say if you have a morose personality or you suffer from some other psychological problems -you might want to avoid seeing this. I did feel like I needed to wash my brain with something to disinfect it afterwards......if that's what they were trying to accomplish -it worked.
B006ON41FC|5.0|so addicting it has little challenges you can by outfits and boosts and has ranking I started playing at 11:32 I loooked at the clock it was 2:45 wow addicted to this game buy it now!!!!!

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I think that this game is cool and I really reccomend this game. Please play this awesome game so enjoy.
0743299795|3.0|There is some value in the book.  The Toyota Production System gets description and a bit of explanation.  I especially liked learning about how the TPS evolved.  That the TPS is part of Toyota's culture is not much of a point; of course it is!  Nevertheless, the aspect of culture is important and given space in the book.  The authors take too much time and space hyping the story.  They have created a false dichotomy to make thing more interesting, and I dare say, sell more books.  The lean vs. mass production dynamic really is more a creation of the authors than something that exists in reality.  Making that false dichotomy is not useful to learning or assaying potential improvements in management and production.  Still, the book did open discussion in America more to the TPS.  And, if even for the historical value, it's worth a read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is not too bad of a game. Most of the games I find entertaining. Good way to pass some time.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I have my own tech services company; I own Teamviewer and literally couldn't run my business without it - well, technically I could with LMI or GTM, in fact I've owned and used both of those in the past, but you just can't beat Teamviewer.  This Android app is nearly flawless and has saved me a lot of time and trouble several times now.  It's always going to be tough trying to use this on a 4\\" phone, but it's actually quite usable on my KF - I can pinch and zoom and scroll around the screen easily, and as long as I'm not trying to do something too complex then it works great.  Of course I'll always opt to use it on my desktop when I can, but in a pinch, if I need to reset a password or restart a service, this is perfect.  The only drawback I've seen so far is an inability to connect via IP address - it will only work with TV IDs.  Other than that, no complaints here.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I like the story behind all this. Fun and an interesting way to pass the time. I would recommend this to anyone.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Okay. This game is AMAZING. I'm actually a cashier (sad, I know, that I go home a play a bagging game) but its really fun! For all ages too! It's also REALLY addictive!  Anyone and everyone will definitely have fun with this game!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book. It's fun and not shallow, the perfect getaway from daily life. To everyone getting all bent out of shape because young children reading it and falling for abusive men, that is just stupid.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|fun game, but the ads ino it are annoying. you have to bypass them between the levels. haven't made it as far as some other commenters. surprised by high rank of app.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book is one of my alltime favorites. I love the story and I am so excited for the sequel! The cover is great, too. This is a book anyone would love.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love my Kindle Fire and this cover works great to protect it without making it bulky. The MicroShell Folio cover adds almost no additional size and it works perfectly when folded to hold the Kindle Fire.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is one of the best apps I have played.  . . . . . . . .. . . .. . . .. .. .
B0067Q42BY|5.0|solid game, pauses a little during play once in awhile.  play field is a little hard to tap on, but I can't complain since I'm playing on a DROID RAZR.
B004XJHBCE|1.0|This app is useless !! It allows you to create lists with groupings, but you can't do anything with them. Believe me. the Developer himself said it doesn't work on the fire. Do a search on the about after purchase, for Kindle Fire, and you get one question and one response saying that you have create a custum page in order to use it. All the 5 stars are Android users not our scaled down version. Looking for &quot;Kindle Fire Folder Organizer&quot; leads to Jan/2012 Currently not supported on the Kindle Fire. Of course I'm asking for a refund.
B002BWP49C|3.0|Granted my husband and I are not the target demographic for this movie, so perhaps I am judging it a bit harshly, but I felt this dragged. The romance between Edward and Bella is lovely, and all the settings and filming are beautiful (their wedding is exquisite), but splitting Breaking Dawn into 2 parts, and focusing exclusively on the romance side in this part, diminished the opportunity for action in this film, and that left the pacing slow for anyone who isn't completely in it for the romance alone. Granted, there are some wolf/vampire fighting scenes, but there isn't an overall arc of action, like there was with 'bad vampires' Victoria or Laurent in the earlier movies. So there's no real suspense or fear, which is a problem in a vampire movie. There's also a few scenes with Jacob that are written in such a way that they don't seem to make a lot of sense, although they did in the book. Also, the sound-quality when the wolves are 'talking' psychically was a bit hokey, and diminished those scenes.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan, and mostly one of Edward and Bella's romance, you might love this, but if you're in it for the action, this won't be the film for you. It sets everything up though, for the final movie, and I suppose that is really the point.
B0064W667Y|5.0|Now this was a fantastic read. Fables opens up a world of all and any known beings in any fable, nursery rhyme, fairytale you name it. The ensemble of potential characters that this series can contain is endless. In Volume One: Legends in Exile: it's a who-dunnit mystery. The sister of Snow White, Rose Red has gone missing. There is too much blood in her apartment to make it possible that she survived, but where's the body? Mr Wolf and Snow White take on the case together and start interrogating all the people Rose Red has been known to consort with.<br /><br />Volume One contains the first 5 issues of Fables, but contains the whole complete story of Rose Red's disappearance and ends on a very perfect ending to her story. The combination of dialogue vs illustrations was perfect and the introductions to several other characters was not overwhelming and has an opening for several more story lines to branch off.<br /><br />Along with the mystery we get an introduction into the world, how the fables came to be living among the mundanes in our world and the desire to want to be able to go back to their homelands one day.<br /><br />Interesting side characters that are introduced such as Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella and Prince Charming, although we only get a peek into their lives, but the girls take on major kick ass roles. They play an even role against the guys in this story and I loved seeing a new and intriguing way to view Snow White and Cinderella. My favorite character was Snow White, she has a powerful job working for the government, better off divorced and stronger for it, great apartment and can stand up to the more animal side to the guys. By far my least favorite character is her ex husband Prince Charming. He's a cocky, selfish ass.<br /><br />This is by far one of my favorites, I do not know what took me so long to look into this serialized story, no wonder it won an Eisner Award in 2003. I highly recommend it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I could not be happier with this great headset. Sturdy build with good quality sound. Very comfortable for long term use. Only draw back is that it's a little on the heavy side, but still the most comfortable over the ear headset I've used. Highly recommend.
0307959856|5.0|P. D. James brings her elegant style to a continuation (not a sequel) of Jane Austen's classic.  The plotting is tight, and the murderer is not apparent until the very end.  Having started with Austen's characterizations, James keeps the characters engaged and changing.  Austen-philes may find the re-telling of the P&P story in the first chapter a bit much, but readers who aren't up on Austen will find it helpful.  In some senses, this is a story of redemption.  Loose ends are tied up, and finally, finally, the Wyckham and Lydia problem is solved. Readers who love Austen and James will not be disappointed in Death Comes to Pemberley.
B006ON41FC|4.0|um. delightful. amusing. some what addicting. time consumer. fun. I got it free so its worth it. um. I hope you enjoy the app
B006ON41FC|4.0|The game in itself is great, but there are several things that shoud be corrected. I've been reading other reviews to see if I was the only one, but apparently a lot of people are having problems getting the expensive gear to work. My owl helmet never had any effect.  That aside, the fact that Open Feint doesn't ask you to opt in first and you have to manually remove the account is annoying. Not to talk of the ever-present pop-up to rate the game. I don't think that's a good way to get positive reviews, when the only reason people do them is to get rid of the pop-up...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was reluctant to pick up this book because it's young adult (and I assumed it was like Twilight), but it really is a nice light social commentary with a killer plot.  The characters are probably a little thin, but the world Collins created was very deep.  Great book for all ages and i think it will have lasting power.  I plan on giving it to my kids when they are old enough.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|looking for a game that you can play just to consume time? this one is perfect! I play this all the time just to get my mind going and to take up time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this last book of this trilogy. The characters were really fleshed out here, and I found the plot to be fast-paced and exciting. I was pretty sure where it was all headed so there wasn't a lot of suspense, but getting there was fun, with enough twists and turns along the way to keep things interesting. I don't often read books more than once, but this trilogy might be added to those few that I do.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good game play and even better that its a free app of the day !  Really nothing i can complain about after playing a few minutes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app I use it everyday for bible study and just reading the plans also. I also love how you go right to the passage in the Bible no waisting time.skimming pages.
B000646MNE|5.0|When this show first came out on HBO, I didn't have ANY intention of watching it because it looked TOO girly for my taste.  In 2004, after the series had ended, I couldn't find anything to rent at the video store, so I figured what the hell? The first episode is a bit grainy, but thereafter it gets much better.  The wit of ALL of the characters astounds me! I can see a bit of each of the 4 girls in me and I'm sure that's the reason I was so drawn to this show and HAD to buy the complete series.  There's ALWAYS a situation that either you or someone you know has faced in this series and that's what made is such a smash hit to both women and men alike.  Hilarious and real.  If you haven't watched this series yet, what the hell are you waiting for?!? You won't be sorry.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm not one to ordinarily review an app, but I really felt like I had to this time. I saw all the low reviews and complaints about this game, but I really like mahjong so I thought I'd give it a try, particularly since it's the FPAOD today. After playing it, all I can say to the low reviews is.....really? So there are some ads. Actually, they are more of the &quot;you may also like&quot; type ads and even so, who cares???? So there are ads! Get over it. There are ads everywhere. You pay for cable and there are still ads. And the &quot;forced&quot; tutorial; big whoop on that too. If you are so increadibly smart that you don't need the tutorial, just whip through it and you're done.  If you are wanting an awesome Mahjong app, you have found it. And I don't know why the Kindle Fire guy couldn't get it to work. It works fine on my Kindle Fire.
0451457994|5.0|Having heard about this book & movie for years, I was always curious about them both.  I recently caught the movie on cable and was absolutely BLOWN away by what I saw!  It was a real \\"minder bender\\" if you will.  My 12 year old son and I sat and watched it trying to figure out just what the heck was going on.  I immediately ordered the book from amazon.  I couldn't put the book down.  It's an easy read.  You will enjoy it as much, if not more than the movie.  The book explains in more details just what's transpiring in the movie!  This book is a must read for any fan of Science Fiction!  I am new to the genre.  I started reading science fiction 6 months ago.  The one thing I enjoy is finding parallels from these books to todays world.  It's easy!  Even in 2001: A Space Odyssey, while crewmen, Poole & Bowman are sitting and eating, it appears they are both watching a news reports on their ipads.  Both book and movie are excellent!<br /><br />Read the book!  You will enjoy it!!  And will become a part of you.
B007B8GI28|5.0|Since the premiere of 'The Walking Dead', I have been a huge and faithful fan.  I never miss an episode.  At least, if the weather permits.  Unfortunately, this past Sunday, February 19th 2012, we had so much snow in my area that the Satellite went out.  I was  unable to see my episode on AMC like all of the other faithful followers of the series.  So, I turned to the next best thing, AMAZON INSTANT WATCH!<br /><br />I am so happy that Amazon has this series available and that they update the episodes so quickly.  I don't think I could have waited another week to catch up on my #1 favorite Zombie Apocalypse show!!!!<br /><br />The Walking Dead is based on the novels but it has so much more to offer.  This series does not follow the novels precisely.  No!  It takes its own life!!!<br /><br />The world has fallen prey to an apocalypse where zombies aka Walkers roam the earth, looking for something or someone to eat.  If you are not fast enough, careful enough, or smart enough, then you are nothing but a dead man walking, seriously.  There is plenty of horror and suspense in this series.  Lots of blood and guts, too, but what I love most is the development of the characters within the series and their relationships between one another.  You do not only have a horror flic, but a depiction of the life of the survivors who go day by day, struggling to make it without being bitten or scratched.<br /><br />As the characters develop and grow, there are some definite changes that this new world of horror and death has forced upon them.  The most noteworthy, especially in this episode called Triggerfinger, is Rick's understanding of the way things work.  Once a Sheriff's Deputy who did all he could to make things right, now he must kill to keep those he loves safe.  In a world where the dead walk, the living must do all that they can to survive, and at any means necessary, Rick has just come to terms with these facts after having to put down one of his own.  Faced with no other alternative, he is slowly becoming something he never wished to become, but what choice does he have?<br /><br />He has a wife, child, and a baby on the way.  His responsibilities to those  he protects is worth more than any moral standing or codes that were once part of the way of each and every human being.  If he and the others are to survive, they must be prepared to sacrifice everything.  Many, including Shane, have already begun to walk down that path.  It is up to Rick to catch up and prove his place in their group.  If he doesn't, there is no telling what will happen should his loyalty and, most importantly, his ability to lead and make the best decisions be questioned.  Already there are signs of discourse flowing between group members.<br /><br />At the very end of Triggerfinger, Rick and Lori are speaking about Shane, and one can tell that Rick's resolve to protect his family is hardening.  You can tell it in his eyes as you watch them become detached and void of any previous semblance of his former self.  It is killed or be killed in this new world, and Rick refuses to be the one to die, not when his wife and children are depending on him.  Nothing and no one will stand in his way and keep him from his family....<br /><br />Maybe not even his long time friend Shane....ething he never wished to become, but what choice does he have?

B006GLN17G|4.0|True Blood is a masterful piece of work that truly depicts the brutality and sensuality of vampires.  There is no sparkling or glitter here, only the cold, hard, and pointy truth behind true vampires.  While I am not a die hard fan of true blood, I will say that it does have its truly to 'die for' moments within the series.  The only thing that I am not a fan of is all of the sex.  Sex, sex, sex, left and right, up and down, in and out, and all about.  I so didn't mean to go all Dr. Seus there, but it is true.  The opening to True Blood, the very first season, had me turn off with the series.  While the idea of Vampires is erotic to many and most, I think the series pushed that a little too far, especially in the beginning.<br /><br />As the series played out, however, I found it to be more bearable.  There was actual plot and purpose, not just mindless sex.  The characters are developed and mastered, which makes the series even more enthralling.  There are plenty of twists and turns, many Oooohh and Ahhhh moments, and a lot of WTF just happened parts.  The further into the series that you get, the better it becomes in my opinion.<br /><br />I am looking forward to more from True Blood and only hope that it continues to progress further!

B00117U1GE|5.0|I had heard of Supernatural, but until this past week, I had not taken the time to explore it.  I have to say that I am sad that I waited this long to check it out.  I have fallen in love with this series and I can see why others have as well!<br /><br />First off you have Dean and Sam(my), two brothers who have been through hell and back.  When Sam was just 6 months old, his mother was killed by a demon who tried to take Sam and the rest of his family out as well.  Thanks to their father, Dean (the oldest) and Sam made it out alive, but their mother burned with the house.  Heartbroken, the father sets out for revenge while taking his sons with him.<br /><br />When the series starts, you open up to Dean, fully grown, asking Sam, a college boy ready to graduate, to help him find their father who has been gone too long on a 'hunting trip'.  Sam had long ago left the life of a hunter in hopes of normalcy, but he was never normal.  Once again he is pulled back into the life of a Hunter as he and Dean try to find their dad while saving people along the way.<br /><br />Each episodes opens to a different paranormal event, and each gets better than the last.  While on their travels, the boys must learn to work together and get along, but that doesn't always happen.  Each is hiding something from the other, whether its insecurity, jealousy, or a  hidden and deep secret.  Those hidden emotions and feelings only cause the boys to bump heads along their journey, but they still manage to function as a team.  Blood truly is thicker than water in this series!  The search continues for their dad, bringing with it trepidation as the boys grow closer, especially considering that their dad is the one sending them on missions while he looks for the killer of their mother.<br /><br />Sam's insecurity and Deans feelings of hurt and betrayal from his brothers abandoning him and their father pushes the boys harder than they will ever know.  In this particular episode, Dead in the Water, the boys are drawn to this new town due to a series of drownings which seem to be centered around this one particular lake.  As they search for clues, they come upon the realization that something bad has happened.  It's not Nessie taking these people, its an angry spirit looking for revenge.<br /><br />As they sort through the clues and figure out what really happened, they are faced with a haunting realization.  It's up to them to figure out a way to stop the killing spree before its too late...<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this chilling episode as much as I did...<br /><br />So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!a series of drownings which seem to be centered around this one particular lake.

B002BWP49C|1.0|As a true Twilight fan, it was hard for me to come away from this movie and admit disappointment. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing - or, should I say, WASN'T seeing.  I found the whole thing to be benign and forced.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|This is an excellent movie for fathers or anyone who is a father figure to see. Every father need to resolve to be inspiring and this serves as a good tool that can help. Well done!

B00007AJGH|5.0|My sister and I have loved this movie since we were children and watched the VHS copy we had over and over again so when her birthday recently came up, I knew exactly what to get her (and couldn't believe I hadn't thought of it before!). The dvd came in a timely manner and the packaging was unharmed. She was thrilled when she unwrapped it and we've already had a sister movie night and watched and laughed along just like we used to :)

B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was amazing. I'm still in school and I learned about this book from a book report. Soon everyone had The Lightning Thief in their hands.Now I have 30 greek books in my collection.All because of this book.I know more about greek myths than my father and grand father together.This book is great for all ages who like any genre will LOVE this book.Educational and action filled, this is just another fantastic creation from Rick Riordan.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was filled with deadly romance, unsuspected friends, loving someone so much you would risk your life, hunger, death, and an urge to survive. This book won't dissapoint. 5 stars isn't good enough to describe this book.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I ordered this series to read in my spare time on my Kindle because my kid sister really enjoyed reading it, which interested me.  I was amazed at how sucked in to the stories I became.  I read them all within a few days and barely put my Kindle down.  I was disappointed when the books came to an end, wanting more.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|REF: Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Black  As with the Marware Kindle Fire Clear Screen Protector, this product is awful.

B006E4QCXU|4.0|Gravilux is a great game and all I just don't know why its 1.99! Its not even a real game. I think they should have made it 99c at the highest.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After many years of not reading I decided its time to get back into it.  Wool 1-5 was a perfect way to get back into it and reminded me of why I love to read.  Even if your not a huge fan of science fiction this series portays the struggles that can happen in any society.  Some where in the middle the books seems to lose a little steam, but it continues to build til the end.  A great read from an author I would have never tried if it not been for Amazon.  I am now looking at the authors other titles.
1595827684|5.0|I purchased the Art of the Mass Effect Universe book for my husband as a gift for Valentine's Day. He was very surprised since he's a big fan of all kinds of art especially video game art. He was very pleased with the hardcover book. Am not an expert in these things a book is a book to me, but the way he inspected it checking the hardcover surface and checking from point to point and then viewing the contents of the art book it's more like dissection to me what he's doing. Then I saw his smile on his face was priceless, he was very pleased. Amazon did an excellent job in packaging the Art of the Mass Effect Universe Hardcover Book even though USPS pried it open the inside contents came undamaged, well shrink wrapped on a hard cardboard. If anyone who loves art especially video game art then I recommend this book to you.

0688014291|5.0|My prof for Video Game Production had this short book as required reading for the class. I really enjoyed reading this and will encourage anyone that ever has to lead a group of people to read it too. The book is told as a simple story and as you progress you are taught the principles of the One Minute Manager. As I'm reading this I'm thinking \\"Wow, that seems like it should just be common knowledge\\", but it isn't.<br /><br />While you or I may have thought of it, or part of it at some point, it's nice to have a quick book lay it all out for you to digest and internalize as a whole philosophy for managing any group of people.<br /><br />Unfortunately the majority of people that move up to the title of manager have little to no training ... managing people. My personal experience is that anyone without management training decides that managing = \\"cracking the whip\\" and then doesn't understand when he not only doesn't get the results he expected but that his entire team wishes he would die in a fire.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for anyone promoted to manager.

B00000293E|5.0|Willie Dixon was the house songwriter, producer, sometimes standup bass player, and sometimes vocalist for The Chess Brothers studio in Chicago.  His songs formed the basis for the blues from the late 40s onwards, and carried over into rock.  Most of his songs were perfomed by others, such as Muddy Waters[[ASIN:B000002Q40 The Chess Box :Muddy Waters]], and a good collection by various performing artists is found in [[ASIN:B000002P8I Chess Box]] along with his bio.  The present collection is 9 of Willie Dixon's songs performed by himself.  It is a somewhat slim representation of his work.<br /><br />Willie Dixon was an advocate for other musicians, getting their work properly credited and produced.  He served as a springboard for many.  Honors came late, often after his death.  Vicksburg, the city of his birth, has a mural of Willie playing the standup bass among the murals on the Vicksburg floodwall, a local tourist attraction, and also named a street after him.  Like many blues musicians, he left Mississippi and moved north to Chicago.  The booklet included in the jewel case with the present recording provides scant information.  A more complete booklet is included with the aforementioned Chess<br />Box collection (which has always been a best buy).
B0000VCZKM|5.0|AWESOME!! Annie was my favourite movie growing up and now I have passed it on to my 8 year old niece... she loves it just as much. We are going to the stage production next month so I bought this DVD for her as an introduction to the songs and story. If you are going to buy the DVD this is the ONLY version to get!! A great present for any young girl aged 3-13.
1608193381|1.0|I generally try to finish books as sometimes books can improve as you get into them. This book was just painful, though. I suspected something was wrong on the very first page when the author, talking about the ongoing financial catastrophe, says (p. xiii), \\"This catastrophe has ultimately been created by the free-market ideology that has ruled the world since the 1980s,\\" only to proceed to talk about how \\"there is really no such thing as a free market\\" (p. xvi). Thus he blames the ongoing financial calamity on something that he himself says doesn't exist. Some of what he says serves as a good description of economic and political realities, but much of it undermines the very argument he's trying to make - that the free market doesn't work. Would a truly free market be as good for the world as its most ardent proponents claim? I don't know because we've never really had one and likely never will.<br /><br />To pose just one question to the author (or anyone else who'd like to blame the current situation on the free market): How can the market be free when the Federal Reserve sets interest rates? Monetary policy (i.e., tinkering with the money supply by the Fed) introduces many distortions into the system that over the long term create massive imbalances. In his great book [[ASIN:0471732834 A History of Interest Rates, Fourth Edition (Wiley Finance)]], Sidney Homer shows that over very long periods of time (like practically all of recorded history, about 5,000 years), interest rates fluctuated in a range of 6 to 12%. When the Fed keeps interest rates at 1% for years and years, that's not a free market. The free market would not allow such a thing to happen. In addition, the free market didn't decide to bail out the huge banks that took massive risks that eventually blew up. The Fed and Treasury did that, creating the moral hazard that will lead to the next crisis. No free market advocate I am aware of supported bailing out the big banks or any of the other interventions the Fed and federal government have been undertaking for the last several decades.<br /><br />At any rate, this book is very short on cogent argumentation as to why the free market doesn't work and long on non sequiturs, flimsy evidence, and contradictions. Personally, I actively seek out books or other materials that argue carefully against a position I've read elsewhere. I'm an agnostic on most things, including on whether the free market is all that. But I'm open to believing that it's as good as it gets. So far, I've read little to convince me that there's a better alternative, and this book is one of the worst I've read recently. Stay away.ons the Fed and federal government have been undertaking for the last several decades.<br /><br />At any rate, this book is very short on cogent argumentation as to why the free market doesn't work and long on non sequiturs, flimsy evidence, and contradictions.

B006Z1XY7E|4.0|Like many, I bought this album after hearing 'Somebody That I Used To Know.' That song has done a real service, introducing me to both Gotye and Kimbra (check out her album [[ASIN:B005WLIOR8 Settle Down EP [+video]]] if you haven't already).  Making Mirrors has a nice variety to the music. For my tastes, none of the other songs rise to the level of enjoyment I have for 'Somebody that I used To Know.' Still, a good half of the songs I found catchy, especially after multiple listenings, and the album is good enough to be getting periodic play at home and work weeks after buying it. That puts it in the top quarter of what I buy.  Gotye (or Wally De Backer, depending on your mood and his) has a voice capable of reaching into the higher registers, producing piercing choruses here and there throughout the music. Each of his songs is distinct, no blending together on this album, which certainly adds to its repeat playability.  'Eyes Wide Open' is my second favorite track, with a driving beat, and a strong performance by Gotye. 'Smoke and Mirrors' also has something special, though I'm not certain if it's the song or the way the instruments half remind me of the doors and 60's and 70's rock. 'Save Me' makes good use of Gotye's vocal talents, and is a pleasure. Several of the other tracks - 'In Your Light,' 'State of the Art,' 'Save Me,' don't do much for me, thought they're pleasant enough to listen to.  Finally, this download includes a PDF of the booklet (CD pamphlet?), containing all of the lyrics. It's a nice bonus on top of the music.  I enjoyed this album, and will check out future releases from Gotye, but I would say the album isn't so strong that I would buy his next work without first previewing it.

B006C45CFG|1.0|when i first saw this preview in the theaters, i was intrigued. very intrigued: a cowboy wakes up in the middle of a wild west street with a funky bracelet like handcuff. Before you can say 1784, the handcuff beeps a Decidedly 21st string of beeps, and the handcuff transforms into an alien ship destroying weapon!  i like daniel craig as an actor (layer cake, casino royale, arch angel), and liked his portrayal of a no nonsense Clint Eastwood meets James bond character a lot during the first half of the movie. The movie also has amazing cinematography and locales going for it in the first half. Then all goes to hell (in an utterly non-entertainingly bad way) when they try to assemble any thing resembling a plot or storyline. It seems as though the creative geniuses asked themselves : what would it *look* like if aliens landed when the cowboys were settling the west and starting the gold rush. They however seem to have forgotten to really think through \\"what would happen\\" and \\"why\\", or maybe some focus group decided for them and told them that wasn't important.  The result is a visually stunning piece of art that stinks like a rotten fart. There is nary a story, nor a plot. The actors are wasted, the action mind bogglingly stilted, and the dialog is trash. There are plot \\"wtf\\"s that are really difficult to look past even for a die hard Steven Segal or Van Damme fan. E.g. Wtf would aliens, with decidedly superior tech, fight hand to hand with humans, even as they were being gutted down with their own amazingly destructive blast weapon? Surely they had the fore thought to bring more than one of those.  The list of big names that took to produce this travesty on celluloid (or digital bits) should be a badge of shame for hollywood.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|I've had this product for just 3 days , but have used it several times. I have had no problems with a lose connection to the Ipad2. It connects just as securely as the charging cord that comes with the device. Have no idea how apple could change that. The first 2 movies I watched were The Paper Chase from Netflix and a movie I downloaded and rented from the Itunes store. the Rental was in SD and it was obvious that the Paper Chase was being streamed in SD as well. While the well lit areas of the movie were decent, the blacks were very \\"muddy\\" and poor. I then downloaded a free preview of the new series Awake in HD. The picture quality was just stunning, looked and may have been 1080p. So, beware what signal you're putting in to your TV. Pay the buck extra for HD and you'll be very happy.

B002ZG975Q|3.0|\\"Beastly\\" is a filmic version of an Alex Flinn novel of the same title, a modern retelling of the famous story of \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" Anyway, that's what they say. Not having read the original book, I cannot be sure, but it looks as if so much stuff is missing in the film adaptation, which feels often rushed.  Now, \\"the Beast\\" is Kyle (Alex Pettyfer, \\"I Am Number Four\\"), handsome, popular but arrogant high school student, and son of a news anchor; \\"Beauty\\" is Linda (Vanessa Hudgens, \\"High School Musical\\"), a quiet student of the same school who has to live with him (for a very contrived reason) in an expensive New York house with him.  The film's story is told from the viewpoint of Kyle, who is turned into the \\"Beast\\" by Kendra, an eccentric student, or \\"enchantress,\\" effectively played by Mary-Kate Olsen. Dakota Johnson appears as Sloane, Kyle's girlfriend before he becomes \\"beastly,\\" but her role is almost non-existent, even pointless.  The screen time of \\"Beastly\\" (that runs only 86 minutes) is too short for what it wants to be. It is too short for Kyle and Linda's romance to be believable, which needs more space to develop. The film is also humorless. Humor comes in the form of Neil Patrick Harris's tutor Will. Talented as he is, his character does not have much to do in the underwritten storyline.  Watching \\"Beastly\\" is like eternally waiting for something interesting to happen. It does when Mary-Kate Olsen and Neil Patrick Harris show up on the screen. Unfortunately, they are not the stars of the film.
B004LROMQG|5.0|Merlin season 3 remains excellent with action, interpersonal play and humor (which makes this series great)- so my advice is to simply watch it!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I cruised through [[ASIN:B0055SWM08 Quell]] and loved it. I figured Quell Reflect would be the same but different levels. For the most part it is but Quell Reflect seems much more challenging and takes more hints and multiple tries to get through many levels.<br /><br />Lots of great logical thinking, planning and trial and error. Another great app from Fallen Tree Games.

B000OVLBF8|4.0|\\"Ghost Rider\\" stars Nicholas Cage as a supernatural super-hero.  By day he is Johnny Blaze, a stunt biker in the vein of Evel Kneivel, who takes the nickname of his inspiration too far when as a teen he signs a document by a mystery man (Peter Fonda) to prevent his father from dying of cancer.  Tragically, Blaze's dad dies in a motorcycle crash, and the mystery man turns out to be Mephistopheles, who promises that the young Blaze's soul is now his.<br /><br />One fateful evening, Blaze begins to turn into a bizarre avenger, whose body is made bone, flame, and black leather.  He is now the Ghost Rider, the \\"bounty hunter\\" for the underworld, who will seek vengeance and punishment on wayward demons who venture from Hades to Earth without permission from the boss.<br /><br />Eva Mendes is Roxanne Simpson, a TV reporter and former childhood sweetheart of Blaze, who becomes the target of the main villain, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the son of Mephistopheles who wants to take over the family business by unleashing an apocalypse on Earth so he can have an evil army to take out his old man.  A nice supporting nod is from Sam Elliot, as Caretaker, Blaze's mentor in handling his new powers.<br /><br />The movie is aware of its Marvel comic book roots and it is over-the-top where it needs to be.<br /><br />If there are any quibbles, it's that the action sequences tend to end rather abruptly-- allegedly, budgetary constraints were the reason for this.<br /><br />Overall this film is an entertaining popcorn flick.  Despite the nominal occult themes, the film isn't particularly scary, and at PG-13, most of the violence is directed at clearly inhuman monster-villains.  The sequel hits theaters in 2012, so if you haven't seen the original, brush up and buy this now.

B005UBNKZG|2.0|I have been building computers for just shy of 20 years, and usually the biggest challenge for me is keeping with all the new standards.  When it comes to the CPU I generally go to benchmark websites and see how the most recent crop stacks up.  In this case i first heard of the 'bulldozer' chip in a PC magazine that had less than favorable impressions.  I have never been brand loyal to either Intel or AMD as each has had it's generations of dominance.  Unfortunately for AMD, not only is Intel's current line of I-Core chips remarkably better performers, this is the first CPU I have ever felt was actually worse than the previous generation.<br /><br />My experience with the FX 8120 was very negative.  When I first started up the machine I noticed a tendency for the windows install to go through spurts of activity and then stalling.  I chalked it up to hardware recognition issues as I was installing XP 64.  Once I got the OS on, the first thing I did was install drivers and update the motherboards bios.  I figured this would take care of any external performance issues, allowing the chip itself to finally run full speed.<br /><br />The stuttering continued.  I had just upgraded the system from AMD 8A APU processor as this machine was intended to be an HTPC.  I found I wanted to run some programs that required some higher horsepower however and decided to move to a larger case with a dedicate video card and full size AT power supply.  The first thing I noticed was that on nearly every front, the machine ran worse.  I spent an entire afternoon making sure every driver was updated, the bios's updated, and all the bios settings optimized.  I never was able to make the chip run even remotely well, and I noticed around this time that just idling the CPU was running nearly 65 degrees Celsius (normally I would expect 48-50 degrees Celsius).<br /><br />I returned the CPU and opted to go with a core I-5 2600k which ran about $20 more.  It out performs this cpu, runs quieter, cooler, the fan is half the size, and overall it is the best extra $20 I could have spent.and overall it is the best extra $20 I could have spent.

B0051MKNV8|1.0|\\"Limitless\\" serves only to irresponsibly indulge fantasies of those who want to be rich, attractive, and sexually active.  That being said, a lot of people will like it, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone.  The protagonist pursues drugs, money, sex, and power with little restraint while managing to escape a lot of natural negative consequences.  Five-word synopsis: Drug brings man material success.  In a moment that almost gives hope to those of us with a sense of morality, Robert DeNiro's character cautions the protagonist about his rapid rise in status, saying that he did not earn it like others have.  At this point I felt like there might actually be a moral to the story, but as the movie continues the word of warning turned out to be hollow; the film scoffs at morality, paints a man who is not good as the good guy, and heaps material reward upon him.  Meanwhile, viewers are shown some rather disgusting violence.  The acting and direction is done well enough, but it led me to a place I didn't want to go.  However, some people will enjoy this fancifully amoral fantasy.  Note: I didn't see the Unrated Extended Cut, but I can only assume that it is even worse than the theatrical release.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love the layouts and ease of the control. File is a little large but it makes for a great look and playability.

0374275637|5.0|I really liked this book, except by its introduction (it seemed like too much praise for one author until I realized he was dead). Beyond that, it is full of interesting experiments.  What I recall the most is the idea that luck and serendipity play a huge part on our everyday life, and how we crave certainty. I also liked the explanation of why punishment seems to work better than praise to improve performance (extreme performances, good or bad, will tend to go back to average in next try).

Better than the critics give it credit for I'd reccomend this flick, plus ther's a really good fight scene between Owen, and Statham, that's worth the pric of admission alone.

B006YTTVHO|1.0|If you were raised by wolves and never had a social life with the other wolves, this book might be helpful. Otherwise you probably learned all this stuff by 3rd grade. E.g., it's good to have empathy, if you're talking about a sports team ask about their last game, ask someone their point of view on the topic of discussion, keeping an open posture is inviting to conversation, and on and on.  The <only> thing I never thought of as a \\"conversation starter\\" I find kind of creepy. It suggests that if you see someone you'd like to meet (I think the example was if you're in a coffee shop and see someone on the street), you should ask that person for directions because it's supposedly innocuous and gives you a way to meet someone. That seems just wrong on so many levels (what? you just go by looks? are you such a loser you can't expose the \\"real\\" you? if you lie about how you're meeting me, what else are you going to lie about down the road? i could go on).  And thanks for making me suspicious of anyone asking for directions ever again.

B000FC130E|5.0|To be honest fantasy didn't used to be high on my agenda of must have books but after being introduced to the genre with the fantastic and exciting [[ASIN:B005FNGH8G Ignition (Librarian)]] I made the decision to begin exploring away from my comfort zone. Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman initially sounds like a children's book but the reader is taken to a multi-dimensional London on a journey which proves to be dark and dangerous. In fact the intense writing style gives an oddly realistic feel and quite disturbingly it makes you wonder if there is any truth in the story. Is there in fact another \\"version\\" of London just below the surface? Perhaps!

031618201X|5.0|(Originally rated at Goodreads) **SPOILERS**<br />A splendid retelling of Carriger's first novel in the Parasol Protectorate series through comic art. I love how it was displayed, and not so overly convoluted with extreme details concerning the steampunk inventions (that can wait until further novels). I love how the characters were interpreted here. It also held much of what occurred in the original novel. I only wish that a few scenes hadn't been cut (in my nit-picky opinion). Particular scenes such as where Alexia's two sisters meet Lord Ambrose and Ivy meets Tunstell, which all were to occur at the wedding. Hopefully, these side characters will get some more screen time on the pages in the future. Otherwise, everything else was nicely set up and well executed in the graphic novel format.
B0071NLG0W|5.0|**author provided review copy**<br /><br />This is my 3rd Sibel Hodge book that I've read. I've found another favorite! Her writing style is care-free, and she adds so much silliness. But that's just what I've read. She has a serious title out there - Trafficked, Diary of a Sex Slave - which is considered a must read for some college courses...impressive, right?<br /><br />This is the 3rd book in the Amber Fox mysteries, and it's the first one I read. You don't have to read the first two installments. I think I'd like to, though. But I wasn't lost and nothing was missing. If there was a backstory, she gave a quick synopsis to catch a new reader up.<br /><br />Voodoo was a component of this story, and while Amber was full of misconceptions, other characters provided more facts. I think Sibel gave a well rounded look into voodoo. Usually a writer just uses the evil side to propel a story, I was impressed.<br /><br />I never saw the cover until I started writing this review, so I can't say it drew me in. The title and author did that just fine! :) Look at that! Perfect for Valentines Day. And I did read it on that day too. LOL There is the mystery and a bit of a love story too.<br /><br />I love the quirky mystery-solving ladies, and Amber Fox is my newest favorite. And unlike Stephanie Plum and Barbara Marr, Amber knows what she is doing, having worked as a police officer for 17 years.

B004XE0P5E|4.0|Three years on from his startling debut [[ASIN:B0011HF6GE For Emma, Forever Ago]] and after some brilliant collaborations with the likes of Kanye West ([[ASIN:B004BSIJ9Q My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy [Explicit]]]), Justin Vernon's solo vehicle Bon Iver is very much 'of the moment'. Ditching the subtle intimacy of his debut, [[ASIN:B004XE0P5E Bon Iver]] is a sonic expansion; adding horns, strings and a more lush sense of production to create a fuller and ultimately more grandiose album. The influences of his 'mainstream' collaborations are evident here and results in a relatively accessible sound. Songs such as [[ASIN:B005C7MWLQ Holocene]] and [[ASIN:B005C7N0SA Calgary]] show the way that Vernon has managed to adapt his folk leanings into a more fleshed out sound. Whereas on his debut the instrumentation and production seemed peripheral to the lyrics and his frail falsetto, here all of the elements manage to work beautifully in unison. There truly is some innovative and beautiful songwriting to be found on this album. The lyrics are still as hard to decipher not only in their literal form but also when sung by Vernon. Of minor concern is the rather dated feel of some of the songs. This is especially true of the album's closing track [[ASIN:B005C7N1N4 Beth/Rest]] while beautiful, is remarkably dated with it's Bonnie Raitt nuances ([[ASIN:B000T1FR8A I Can't Make You Love Me]]). Alongside this, the album falls victim to a 'mid-length slump'. The tracks [[ASIN:B0054JUTIA Michicant]],[[ASIN:B005C7MZ1S Hinnom, TX]] and [[ASIN:B0054JUTYE Wash.]] are rather lackluster affairs that simply feel like a retread of preceding songs. Bon Iver at times suffers from a lack of variety and an upbeat tempo song would do wonders to break up the mid-tempo monotony. However, it is impossible to deny Vernon's exquisite songwriting capabilities and the aching beauty found within the music.  8/10.

B001FB55H6|2.0|I was unfamiliar with \\"The Watchmen\\" graphic novel, and had wanted to see the movie when it was in theaters.  I saw this on my home theater via Amazon's streaming video.  First, the good: The story line has some interesting components - an homage to comic book characters of the past, some interesting twists in the relationships of the characters, and the compelling \\"back story\\" of some of the super heroes - especially Rorschach.  I can see how it would work well as a graphic novel.  There were very good performances by Jeffrey Dean Morgan as \\"The Comedian\\", Stephen McHattie as Hollis Mason, Carla Gugino as \\"Silk Spectre\\", and especially Jackie Earle Haley as \\"Rorschach\\".  The art direction of the movie is very good.  The visuals of the dark world of the super heroes are excellent, and the vision of Mars was beautiful.  The main problem is, in the end, these are comic book heroes.  There's just not enough story to support a three hour run time.  At some point, even the best fight sequences become tiresome if it's the sixth or seventh time a fight breaks out on screen.  A second problem is the uneven quality of the acting.  After that, the acting is sometimes there, sometimes not, and when it's not, you start looking at your watch, wishing the scene would end already.  For me, the biggest problem is the run time.  If the movie was around 100 minutes, I probably would have rated it very highly; at two hours, pretty good, but at three hours it's not a good return on the time investment.  I recognize that a director's cut is likely to be a bit self-indulgent, but 187 minutes is a lot to ask from someone when most of it rises to little more than a darker and technically more sophisticated version of the Batman TV series from the 1960's.
B004T0E2S8|3.0|While this app is easier than using Ultimate Guitar's website on your mobile device of choice, it is pretty basic. Offline favorites, which are, strangely enough, different from the favorites on the website somehow, are quite useful when you don't always have an Internet connection. (try the menu button while viewing a tab--that's how you add to favorites!) The extra tools like the tuner and chord library ARE an extra charge, so keep that in mind. I would like to see all of the tabs for a given band as well!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The ads at the beginning aren't a big deal. It's only for a second. Great gameplay. I recommend this game.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Imagine being completely devastated (mind, body, and soul) and then having the ultimate opportunity to step up to the plate and start avenging. Well, this movie takes that step and does so while still expanding on the story and creating a few additional interesting characters to keep the film very interesting. I do not want to spoil any of it, except to say that once the main character is let loose and decides on a direction, he literally starts running and that's what I like to see happen - someone who takes charge of the situation and obliterates his enemies. That makes for some great movie time.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It kept my interest and seemed very plausible. To the reviewer who said the dad turned a blind eye to his sons faults; I thought that made the story more believable. We never want to think our children are anything less than perfect and certainly never capable of harming another human being. I plan to try some of the authors other works...hope they are just as good!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just want to tell everyone that get really good using this program! I really enjoyed playing this game. so I'm inviting you to play
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm a bit of a mahjong snob, and I love this app. The graphics are sharp and its fun to play. I got it when it was free.  Not sure I'd pay five bucks tor it though.

B006PHD0RW|4.0|Good casual game. Challenging enough. Plenty of levels for. 99. Graphics good. Wish a little more variation in groceries to pack but otherwise cute.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|One of the PCI-e slots didn't work when I got it and 2 of the sata outputs were bad. It cost me $80 to have a geek check it and then I figured it out myself. The last 4 sata's worked and one PCI-e slot worked. I think the more complicated they make em, the more they break.
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|I really don't understand all the bad reviews. People need to remember that this is a children's movie, thus, simple plot, simple pleasures. I personally thought it was ADORABLE. Between fluffy baby penguins with various accents who yodel and sing opera, and some easy-to-follow plot and a decent moral, I thought it was an excellent movie. I was laughing and grinning the whole way through.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Owners of Samsung Galaxy Nexus: don't waste your time and money buying this app.  The app installs fine but freezes at random stage when playing.  This is annoying.  If you have doubts, check the compatibility info for the same app in the official Android Market and it should advise you the incompatibility if you have registered the Galaxy Nexus with them.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I am a huge fan of Haruki Murakami books.  His ability to bring these interesting characters and connect them to simple but deep life changing situations is amazing.  He can make a scene so fantastical, but yet relatable and captivating.  IQ84, however, was not one his better works.  My favorite is probably Wind Up Bird Chronicle and Norwegian Wood.  IQ84, tend to be a little too repetitive and predictable.  It could of been condensed by a good 300 pages i feel.  And as in most Murakami books, my favorite characters always tend to be the supporting female role to the protagonist.  In this book, it was Fuka-Eri.  I wish she had more presence near the end of the book.  Although this was not one of my favorite, I can not wait for his next one when it comes.  =)
B004UID2LC|5.0|it was glitchy but i loved it .it kept shutting down but i loved the down load part . over all i would get it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|There is nothing better than a book you crack up the first time reading and then wanting to reread so that you can laugh again.  Tina Fey manages to still come through with the same humorous voice that she does on tv in this book.  Her ability to laugh at herself and find the laughter in flaws makes her such an enjoyable writer.  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who laughs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a real fun App, but I think some of think some of the games are actually quite hard. but their really fun too. so it makes this app such an adicting app.
B006ON41FC|4.0|great game but one thing is there's a glitch and after I hit a tree it freezes and it just stays. if that's fixed it would be used the most on my kindle fire.
B001R4CKGU|5.0|\\"This book is difficult to start. I tried several times, but finally kept reading while on vacation with nothing else to read. I'm glad I did. It is excellent in many ways. The problem I was having getting started, I think, was due to the unusual organization of the book. It starts with George Washington Crosby near death, then backs up, gets into George's father's life, Howard Aaron Crosby, goes forward in time again, and somewhere near the end of the book ties it all together in a satisfying way. I'm still not sure about the two inserted stories, one about clocks and one I don't know what. But even these additions seemed to work, especially the one about clocks. I found parts of the story sad, but I think it was more so since I have recently experienced the death of a family member. It is a short book, so stick it out to the end. It is worth it.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I like the app so far, I have bought apps. by this co. before and liked them. But its hard to leave a great review when they expect one when you haven't had a chance to play it for very long.

Behringer def give you the best bang for you buck. i woudl recommend this to anyone. Plus it came with a cool sticker!! LOL!!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I won't disagree with the many who have reviewed this movie and love it.  It should be a wake up call for all fathers in this country.  It's not the movie, or Amazon I have issue with.  It's the post office.  Amazon deliveries previously took only 3 days to arrive.  But the Post Office has become so lax.  It took a full 7 days after this item shipped, for it to arrive.  That's unacceptable.  I don't know if it was the type of delivery Amazon is using now, or just poor service from USPS, but this is ridiculous.  I will no doubt boycott USPS if this is the type of service they have gone to.  It's not right that you have to pay a premium for the same service that use to be standard.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Got it free, so not distressed by the ads ... sorry if others are ... I'm just having fun. Need more words, so it's still fun ...

B004SEVPWQ|2.0|I bought this app because I like pool sims.  Plus it had carom which I have always been curious about.  It may be my phone (Sam Satelite), but I don't think so.  This is one HARD game. I will give kudos that its physics etc are great. But it's just too darn hard to play for it to be any fun for me.

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|3.3 stars<br /><br />I normally love Jackman, but this is his worst movie, due mainly to truly weak direction by Shawn Levy. That and a hackneyed Disneyesque script make this potentially fine idea limp and boring. I know a lot of folks love this flick, and more power to them, but while watching it with a fellow lover of action films we kept grimacing at how predictable it all was.<br /><br />The robots are fun, no doubt, but Real Steel feels for the most part like an ABC Afterschool Special. So many cheesy and hamhanded moments and so few truly funny lines. Jackman does his best but clearly Levy isn't very good at drawing our truly fine performances, and the seen-it-all-before script does no one any favors.<br /><br />We were really psyched to see this after all the hype, but in the end were mostly bored by a film that looks pretty good but never really got us excited.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love it awesome game. Very fun. Would recommend to every one. Flying squirrels what will they come up with next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. its really fun! LMFAO! My favorite game ever! You should totally get this game! I promise you wont get mad. I'm not lying! But the question is do u like it?!

B004DK5CW4|4.0|This is a great story of family unity and perseverance.  If you don't know (as some of us didn't) the actual true story then it is even more intriguing.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of all the little details and factual reliability, but I can say that it was enjoyable to watch. We found ourselves wanting the characters to succeed.  There were a few weird parts with dancing and some out of place humor but overall this was a great movie.  The end which included facts about the people and horse before the credits roll was a nice touch.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Lovely little puzzle game. I have terrible spatial reasoning, so it is a bit of a challenge for me, but I love playing it.

0670022411|5.0|As someone who devours books - sometimes 3 a week & I work full time! I was amazed and enchanted.  I read a wide variety of everything from Sniper-to-StarTrek, History, \\"Food\\" Murder mysteries, Romance, Comedy, etc. but I do enjoy a good fantasy so read them most of all. Bring on the Dragons, Vamps, Were's and now Witches. Unlike so many books that I read skipping over most of the same old descriptions, or repetative introspections (Unfortunately after so many you find things begin to sound the same) I READ EVERY WORD in this book something that rarely ever happens, much less in a 600 pager! Finally a writer who not only writes intelligently, thinks things through and makes it interesting but whose word flow is simply beautiful. She makes you want to read every word entwining the present and the past, throwing in actual historical presents for her readers. So much information beautifully presented that I guess it was too much for those who rated it boring, etc. I guess it is hard to get interested in a historical character/event/oject if you have never heard of it, maybe they NEED to read more. Anyway I simply loved it, can't wait for rest of trilogy.

B0072GPQ72|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. After seeing it at the theater I came onto Amazon, as I often do, to add it to my wishlist. I then read the unexcited reviews that were found on the product page and thought I should write a review to posit a counter opinion. The other reviews posted didn't seem to have enjoyed the film, two major criticisms being that they found it melodramatic and heavy handed, comments like these make me wonder if audiences have become so cynical that they view any attempt at displaying open/honest emotion to be an attempt at manipulation. Everyone has differing opinions but I feel this film will appeal to anyone who enjoys stylistically well made films and/or anyone who enjoys stories about bonds/will being tested. In a general sense Spielberg uses the story of this horse to explore the human condition and explore some very well done set pieces/environments.<br /><br />As I saw it, the horse is a metaphor for hope and how it can be shared and spread, how it can inspire and endure. I don't mean this in an over sentimental way but just in a very real way. We are all hopeful for different things, big and small, and this film is about how under the right conditions and with the right persistence that hope can avoid being snuffed out or lost.<br /><br />The film, based on a play I have not seen and cannot compare it to, is episodic as the horse goes from owner to owner during the years of World War 1. The fact that the film was episodic didn't make it feel chopped up or give it the feel of a broken narrative. I felt the through line of the film was the human condition and the traveling horse facilitated the telling of several viewpoints while exploring the excellent recreation of a time period. The acting was top notch by everyone seen on screen. To counter another criticism, the main human character, a boy named Albert, does show strong affection for the horse, a character in the film quips \\"come on now boy, it's not as if he were a dog\\". I didn't find this relationship to be strange, the horse simply becomes very important to Albert because as we see he doesn't have much to his life and the horse is something he gets that then works to make his life better. Perhaps I also never found it strange as I always found the horse to be representative of hope rather than as just some random animal.<br /><br />The writing in terms of dialogue flowed and felt incredibly natural, as it does in most Spielberg films. John Williams score, while clearly a John Williams score, is the perfect mix of innocence, action/adventure and drama as the story calls for it. I would strongly compare the pacing and acting to Catch Me if You Can, as that film also had several major settings that shifted as the film progressed. I found War Horse to actually be better paced as it has a few more settings (about 5, possibly 6 in total?) and each one is shorter than the ones in the aforementioned film. Best of all the film actually ends when it ends, the story concludes and there are no tacked on or forced endings for the sake of pandering or over explaining as many recent films have had.<br /><br />As far as the directing, I don't know if one can compare anything to the seeming effortless magic he created in his early films or certain efforts from the 90's but this would be Spielberg above his recent best and closer to those older films in quality. Everything unfolds visually in such an easy to follow an familiar way while still being unique and involving. There are some masterful shots that recall the opening of Saving Private Ryan but in an artistically different way. This is unquestionably due in part to the fact that this film has been made family friendly, while that could serve as a criticism I didn't find the film to be aimed specifically at families, though it has been made to facilitate viewing by younger children. Rather than illustrating the pure violence of battle as he did in SPR, Spielberg spends his time in this film showing the brutality of war in a creative fashion that suggests the horror more than displaying it. There is one such scene in particular where mounted soldiers ride into battle and on the other end of the shot their empty horses emerge without many of the riders they once carried.<br /><br />In a sea of films about special effects, high concept stories or big names here is a film that is a complete film on its own without any gimmicks, as fun as gimmicks can be (Mi4 for example). This film is an actual experience for those who are open to it. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an excellently crafted film that pushed the dark and grittiness, War Horse is a excellently crafted film that pushes the lighter elements but both are equally enjoyable and excellently made. Watching a good Spielberg film is like watching the epitome of what film is. It's like more recently watching Christopher Nolan's films, there are always flaws in any film but films such as theirs are so carefully and purposefully made as films that they are engaging and fully engrossing.<br /><br />One potential weakness I will admit, though I feel a reviewing of the film would diminish it, is that the film doesn't have as strong an arc as most films. The characters change but so much of it is internal here. The horse's first owner does change but he is absent through the middle of the film, the various other owners also change in varying ways but all during their own vignettes. The horse itself has changed in much the same way as his owner as suggested by the final shot of the film, but perhaps critical audience members won't pick up on this. That said, one could (and I would say should) view this subtlety as purposeful. The film isn't as much about how the boy or the horse has changed but how despite all they've been through they managed to stay so much the same, they maintain what could easily have been lost.<br /><br />I dunno, I personally love it (5 Stars) but for objectivity I'll give it 4/5 for general audiences, I think most everyone I described at the beginning of this review will like this film if they view it. For those who feel it is heavy handed and melodramatic go and watch Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, its also an excellent film but there is no overt display of emotion to be found there. Thanks for your timeutality of war in a creative fashion that suggests the horror more than displaying it. There is one such scene in particular where mounted soldiers ride into battle and on the other end of the shot their empty horses emerge without many of the riders they once carried.<br /><br />In a sea of films about special effects, high concept stories or big names here is a film that is a complete film on its own without any gimmicks, as fun as gimmicks can be (Mi4 for example). This film is an actual experience for those who are open to it.

It's like more recently watching Christopher Nolan's films, there are always flaws in any film but films such as theirs are so carefully and purposefully made as films that they are engaging and fully engrossing.<br /><br />One potential weakness I will admit, though I feel a reviewing of the film would diminish it, is that the film doesn't have as strong an arc as most films. The characters change but so much of it is internal here. The horse's first owner does change but he is absent through the middle of the film, the various other owners also change in varying ways but all during their own vignettes. The horse itself has changed in much the same way as his owner as suggested by the final shot of the film, but perhaps critical audience members won't pick up on this. That said, one could (and I would say should) view this subtlety as purposeful. The film isn't as much about how the boy or the horse has changed but how despite all they've been through they managed to stay so much the same, they maintain what could easily have been lost.<br /><br />I dunno, I personally love it (5 Stars) but for objectivity I'll give it 4/5 for general audiences, I think most everyone I described at the beginning of this review will like this film if they view it. For those who feel it is heavy handed and melodramatic go and watch Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, its also an excellent film but there is no overt display of emotion to be found there. Thanks for your time
B0067Q42BY|4.0|A pleasantly fun game. Control scheme works well and runs very smoothly. Story mode is entertaining. Overall a good app and an excellent time sink.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I am usually pushing the capabilities of all my devices and VNC is one of those things that I love to have. This is so much easier to use than most VNC products, it is very inexpensive but it is by far my most useful app I have bought. I originally bought and used other apps that do similar desktop functionality but there were always somethings I coukdnt do, like sending and receiving audio. I downloaded the smaller non HD version and it was great! when i found out there was an HD version I wondered what else could they do better? I bought it with little expectation as to the diference and I was pleasently surprised. It is so much better than the regular version. The mouse is easier to use and the on screne controls are much simpler. I would pay much more for this app than the price they are asking for!<br /><br />I have an Acer Icona A500 and it works great. My kindle fire dosnt seem to be compatible with the HD version but I use the regular on it. I use this app to access 4 diferent computers with 7 diferent user logins. I only have ptoblems with my HP pesario sr1820nx desktop pc. the graphics card will not support either versions of this app.
B003VR5PPY|3.0|999 is a visual novel for the most part. And as the name implies, it is like a graphic novel. People talk and everything they say is put as text on the screen, sadly this game lacks voice acting, which would have made me like it more. So if you don't want to spend hours reading text, this game probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Last night I played this game for two hours and little happened. It was really the first part of the game, you chose to go into Room 5 or 4. Now if you're not great at math (like me) it doesn't matter, if you get something wrong Junpei will usually correct you =)  A lot of the puzzles seem to revolve around the root numbers. Example: 4+1=(5+9)=14... 1+4 =5, get it? So far the puzzles I've seen have required finding that root single number.<br /><br />(Small spoiler) Each person is wearing a 'bracelet\\" with a number and that determines who and how many people will go with you into a room.<br /><br />I do like the mystery and I guess that's why I am trying to play this game, though if you have a super weak stomach and don't like any type of gore descriptions beware. Before the first door there is such a scene, also, one person likes to swear quite a lot.<br /><br />It IS annoying to touch something and have Junpei (you) or your fellow captives talk forever about something. And yes, EACH and EVERY time you touch something text pops up. The only time you can save your game is during the 'Story' phase, when you're not in your 'touch' mode. I haven't done this (stupid me) but there is more than one save slot so I guess if you went to Room 5 to start you could have saved prior in a different spot so you could have your other file be Room 4. Thus making it easier so you wouldn't have to replay the entire intro to go back and see what the other room held.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say about this game. It isn't anything really new. It's a touch and find puzzle game with a LOT of talking. It just reminds me of something you can get from bigfishgames, but for your DS.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|It's always been a dream of teenage boys to have telekinesis. Be it just trying to get the door close when you're trying to sleep or shoving the idiot who's driving behind you off the road, telekinesis is the ultimate form of passive/aggression.  Although the latest movie trend has been to depict realistic superheroes, few have truly committed to the format.  Chronicle is so steeped in its high school subculture that the word superhero is never even mentioned.<br /><br />Chronicle starts with high school and builds its plot from there: disaffected loner Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan), his more well-adjusted cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell), and popular kid Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) discover alien crystals.  The crystals vibrate and hum, inflicting nosebleeds on the three teenagers, all of it recorded by Andrew on film.  The camera winks out only to resume weeks later with a demonstration of their newfound powers.<br /><br />Chronicle's name is obscure but apt because Andrew films everything.  The entire movie is pieced together from Andrew's camera and -- later -- security cameras, news footage, and home video of the inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />Chronicle nails what kids with superpowers would do with them: They'd play pranks, of course.  Their powers are not limited to bending spoons however. Their telekinesis escalates from nudging things to shoving things to creating personal shields and eventually flight.  When that happens, all bets are off.<br /><br />In the beginning the triumvirate, bound by their collective secret, tries hard to support each other. Drunk fathers, social misadventures with girls, and high school popularity all gnaw away at their common bond. Also, a human being flying thousands of feet in the air is dangerous.<br /><br />Chronicle records all of this with the mundanity of a reality show, but it rises above the Blair Witch Project genre when it takes to the skies, where the wind roars constantly.  Some of the special effects are less spectacular - the ones that involve peculiar lighting, like a juggling talent show, are obviously CGI - but when it counts Chronicle's special effects are superb.<br /><br />Chronicle pulls no punches in portraying a broken home life and how a superpower only magnifies the pain.  The inevitability of its protagonists' fates is also the film's biggest flaw. It's no surprise who will take on the role of the hero and who will be the villain.<br /><br />But that doesn't detract from the breathtaking conclusion, a terrifying and (due to the multiple camera POV) disorienting display of telekinesis powered by human emotion.  It's worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />It's easy to chalk Chronicle up as an unrealistic fantasy.  But I couldn't get it out of my head that if you replace the word \\"telekinesis\\" with \\"gun\\"...the body count at the end of the film doesn't seem so unrealistic after all.r lighting, like a juggling talent show, are obviously CGI - but when it counts Chronicle's special effects are superb.

0307957934|3.0|Robert Harris's latest novel, \\"The Fear Index,\\" rests comfortably in Geneva, Switzerland, a town where the rich go to get richer.  In a brisk novel covering approximately 24 hours, Harris attempts to weave together a complex tale of high finance, technology, corruption, and metaphysics.  This spicy concoction has some good moments but ultimately fails to reach the heights of his other books (\\"Imperium,\\" \\"Fatherland\\").  Alex Hoffman, American hedge fund manager and billionaire, contemplates a mysterious package in his inner sanctum - a palace/estate far too vast for just him and his wife.  Somebody has anonymously sent him a first-edition of Darwin worth more than my first and second cars put together.  This intriguing development almost gets forgotten in the ensuing chaos as a madman breaks into his house and, by the way, on the next day he's scheduled to meet with billionaire investors to role out his new hedge fund . . . a fund that will be managed solely by computers executing Hoffman's revolutionary new algorithm.  This algorithm teaches the computers how to invest based on fear.  Fear is something that Hoffman is going to grow all too familiar with over the next day, starting with the realization that the person who sent Hoffman the Darwin book appears to be . . . Hoffman himself.  Ultimately \\"The Fear Index\\" is about the corrupting influence of money and how our modern economy appears to be designed to eliminate humans.  Harris must envision a world where one person will inevitably program a computer so smart and so powerful that the rest of us will become meaningless.  Harris asks, if a smart computer can make investments based on fear, and we live in a completely wired world, how soon will it take the computer to figure out how to generate its own fear?  \\"The Fear Index\\" may be timely, but ultimately it's not that thrilling a thriller.  Hoffman is a poor protagonist, a billionaire engineer who also happens to be a colossal jerk.  If Hoffman were Falstaffianin proportions then \\"The Fear Index\\" would still be interesting (perhaps spectacularly so), but Hoffman is such a robot that he never engenders any sympathy.  Even his wife gets disgusted with him when he admits that he's worth about a billion dollars . . . does he have any priorities outside of making money?  Harris appears on several pages to be setting us up for a high finance version of \\"2001:  A Space Odyssey,\\" with Hoffman's computer serving as HAL, but we never get quite that far.  Too bad - another opportunity missed.  If you've got a long plane flight, you could do a lot worse than \\"The Fear Index,\\" but you could do a lot better, too.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This was a very wonderful, heartfelt movie. It teaches a good lesson in patience and love. We have a young man staying with us that his mother had kicked out of the house. It's wonderful feeling being able to help someone.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I used this DVD the first day I bought it and Jillian Michaels kicked my ass. I am 23 and out of shape after 2 kids. The first day I didn't make it through the whole workout. My thighs and calves were screaming hate words at me. Lol. The second day I was so sore so I was doing something right. After using it again I felt strong in my lower body already. I am on day 3 but loving it because I can't wait to be healthy again and start losing weight. I would recommend using this along with a healthy meal plan. I am still looking for one that works for me. But I love this DVD and would recommend it. I also like how it has 3 different levels that way its not just an ordinary, routine kind of workout DVD. This DVD mixes things up. Kinda like a cheaper version of P90X. I love it. :)

0374275637|5.0|An excellent book very well worth reading, especially for those who with a decent interest in understanding human behaviour. As a graduate student working in a related area of decision making (in engineering and not psychology), it was interesting to get an email from my adviser telling me to \\"immediately go out and buy a copy of Daniel Kahneman's book as it will expand my understanding of the key ideas of the field\\" (i'm slightly paraphrasing). It was with joy I replied him that I already had about a month before and was nearly done reading it.    A large number of the ideas he presents in the book are presented in a much more condensed and technical form in his Nobel prize lecture here - [...]. The advantage of the book is that he expands them making them a lot more understandable and accessible and filling in a lot more examples that further illustrate the points. He also does a fair job of presenting the opposing ideas to his as well.    I encourage everyone to buy it. Even if you disagree with him, it's hard to beat such a coherent and accessible presentation of some of the most revolutionary ideas about human behaviour since Von Neumann and Morgenstern proposed expected utility in 1947.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|This movie was done very well, and I really appreciated that! Being a long-time fan of the original Broadway musical and it's wonderful soundtrack, I was skeptical that this movie would turn out well. So glad I was wrong! The production of this movie was great, with terrific costumes, sets, acting, vocal presentations, effects, etc. It was all good, and I enjoyed it almost as much as the stage show. My children watched it with me, and they (for the most part) enjoyed it, too. They kept asking why there was so much singing in the movie. (This was their first experience watching a musical other than [[ASIN:B002QRCBW0 The Wizard of Oz]], and I know they weren't expecting so much music!) Still, I really enjoyed it, and it was a nice way to expose them to some other form of the arts.
0547258305|4.0|I'm a sucker for a good YA novel, not to mention a fantasy one to boot, so this was such a pleasure to read. I see that some have complained that Katsa was sort of a MarySue, but I disagree. I think she grows a lot as a character - from a scared child who lashes out to a thoughtful and caring human being. To an extent, isn't every lead character a Mary Sue at times anyway? I don't want to read about someone I don't like. I thought the description was great, I don't need four chapters of world-building and back-story to care about the plot or characters, so I appreciated that I wasn't bored. Po was charming, Katsa brave, and although a little unrealistic for a 10-year-old, I loved Bitterblue, too. All in all, a great escapist read. One minor annoyance I had was that the author seems incapable of letting people speak without using the name of the person to whom they're speaking. Po must have said \\"Katsa\\" at least 15 times per page and it got  irritating to the point that I couldn't concentrate on what he was actually saying. They were the only two characters speaking through most of the book...I think your audience can figure it out. ;)
B0001I562I|5.0|I recently saw this video at the local library and picked it up. I remember watching this as a kids back when it was a new movie. I really thought it was cool, at the time, and figured my own kids were old enough to enjoy it, now. I was right. They enjoyed the movie, I'm I'm glad to see that it has held up pretty well to the test of time. Unlike some sci-fi films, this one isn't \\"just for boys,\\" and the movie is clean enough to be family safe. Whether or not you've seen it before, I'd recommend this one for a family movie night. It's still as good as I remembered it being.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I love movies with unexpected twists and Megamind delivered! The classic hero vs. villain is a tale that's been told for decades, but never once on this level.<br /><br />Most villains are seen as power hungry and vain, but MegaMind's childhood has shown that people can relate to him. A lot of school children have felt that \\"fifth wheel\\" feeling at some point in their life and there's the Mr./Ms. Popularity as well.<br /><br />This movie also explains that there can be good and evil in everyone. It tells that people can change as well. How often do you see the main villain fall in love with the damsel in distress and actually win her heart?<br /><br />This movie is one of the perfect examples for the Yin and Yang in everyone.
0439023521|5.0|I decided to pick up this book because I am looking forward to the movie that is coming out in a month and I really wanted to read the story (books are usually always better). I also have a kindle, and with my prime membership am able to view read the book for free. I \\"borrowed\\" the book yesterday and finished it at 10am this morning. I could not put the book down. Right away the story draws you in, you are so eager to know Katniss. Her description of her life, you feel empathy, but she is strong, independent, very capable of taking care of herself. I was constantly worried for her, for Peeta, for her sister at home, for Rue.. The writing is so wonderful that you feel the emotion coming off the page.. Twice I cried.. and thats because i was heartbroken.. through out the rest of the book i was tense, wondering what was going to happen. I'd rather not go into great detail of the plotline, but for me the hunger games had the perfect amount of heart, action, fear, ...love. I am excited to continue on with the story now that I finished the 1st book. I only hope that the movie coming out will do the book justice. It could truely be a wonderful film if done right.

0061992860|5.0|When all is said and done, when a disaster hits, your either prepared or not. There are some simple things you can do to be ready for it whenever it comes and knowledge is something you should always have. This small pocket sized book is a great start to that base. Just having this book isn't going to build you a fire or shelter after a tornado or hurricane rips through your town. You should be practicing the skills offered in this book.  Make this book the start of your disaster preparedness.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|I have all of Kelly Clarkson's albums, my favorite being her last one (All I Ever Wanted). I felt this album was a let down from that one. I only like about half the songs on the album and a lot of them sound the same and are full of angst. This is very different from All I Ever Wanted where the songs sound different from each other, are on different topics, and are mostly happy. I suppose that might have been her intent, but I would have like one or two songs that were fun and happy.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|As always, I enjoy first reading the negative reviews before experiencing the product myself. A summary of the criticisms include that Paul McCartney's latest album is simply dull - lacking the energy of the more traditional rock Sir Paul has generated over the years.  Coming off his latest tour and performing many of the Beatles and Wings classics, I can see why many fans were left scratching their heads.  That being said, this album is a complete departure from much of what McCartney has done over the years. I won't bother breaking down each and every track...but in a nutshell, the music is simply a great jazz recording. I can't help but think most of the fans offering negative opinions would not have batted an eye, had this album been released just before Christmas (save maybe \\"My Valentine\\" and \\"The Inch Worm\\" tracks). I can easily see myself playing this album along with another of my favorites during the holidays next year: Vince Guaraldi's, A Charlie Brown Christmas. Despite my preference, this recording certainly stands out as a fantastic jazz album during any time of the year.  It should come as no surprise that McCartney enjoys indulging in multiple music genres.  Kisses On The Bottom is yet another great example of McCartney's diversity and creativity as an artist.
B004X0XA82|5.0|There is something devout about the vocals here, they come in like the sunlight and fade away like a rainbow. It took me a long time to admire this cd because I was expecting something completely different. The lyrics are slow-burner and are sung with a kind of passerby's nonchalance .. \\"If to borrow is to take and not return, I have borrowed all my lonesome youth\\" the singer wails in Bedouin Dress, one helluva song.<br /><br />\\"So now I am older than my mother and father, when they had their daughter now what does that say about me?\\" from Montezuma is the opening lyric. You're instantly hooked.<br /><br />\\"What makes me love you despite the reservations? What do I see in your eyes?\\" (Sim Sala Bim) What a haunting sound.<br /><br />There is a peak the lead singer reaches in \\"Shrine/Arguement\\" which will leave you baffled because he's about to jump off the hill. \\"Apples in the summer and golden sweet, everyday a passing complete\\" - these lyrics are more beautiful and HAUNTING than BECAUSE BY BEATLES.<br /><br />It is virtually impossible to have a favourite song on this album but if I had to pick one I would pick for the lyrics, the empathy and the emotion the song HELPLESSNESS BLUES, how are these for lyrics... \\"If I know only one thing, it is that everything that I see of the world outside is so inconceivable often I barely can speak. Yeah I'm tongue tied and dizzy / And I can't keep to myself / What good is it to sing helplessness blues / Why should I wait for anyone else?\\" This is the absolute essential classic which is perhaps among the top 100 songs I've ever heard. It is unforgiving and will leave you lashed with Fleet Foxes ... You will hum it day and night, you will ask your friends to listen to it but they won't catch on instantly.<br /><br />Blue Spotted Tail is a perfect lullaby. \\"Lorelai\\" deserves a hundred listens along with \\"Bitter Dancer\\"<br /><br />\\"Grown Ocean\\" is musically superior.<br /><br />What is the best place to try this music? While flying on an airplane. There is no music more damning than Helplessness Blues. This album sounds eternal when you're half asleep, half awake and sifting through sleep.<br /><br />I have seen this band live in Brooklyn and to be honest, they're not one third as good when they play live but I still think they're my favourite band. I compare them with bands like Wild Nothing, Arcade Fire, The Shins, Young The Giant, Warpaint but to be honest Fleet Foxes hold their own. With their second album, I can't complain about a single thing and with the sheer number of listens to this album alone, they have become my favourite album. It is shocking to think they scrapped the whole album and made it again because the sound was a bit too overproduced on the first one.<br /><br />This was the best cd of 2011 along with Zonoscope by Cut Copy..

B0067Q42BY|4.0|I agree that a $5 game should not have ads. However, there is only one ad (referring to other games by the dev) at the beginning of the game. Haven't you ever watched a DVD/Bluray that had a lot of other ads at the beginning? Do you also complain when there are ads before the movie when you go to a movie theater? When you play PS3 games, do you return the game because you had to wait in the loading screen? (which in many cases also contain ads). Ads do not in any way detract from this game, and that is what is important.
B0057D876Y|5.0|How appropriate that vinyl is making a music industry comeback, and that ABBA fans can celebrate \\"The Vistors\\" right on time for it's 30th anniversary. This would be the first full length studio album ABBA would record after both couples had divorced, and it would also be ABBA'S last album ever. The years leading up to this had held much change for their personal lives, and this was certainly reflected by the more mature, progressive atmosphere in their music. While a few songs seemed to wink at the happy ABBA of the past (\\"Head Over Heals\\" and \\"Two For The Price Of One\\"), songs like \\"Soldiers\\", \\"I Let The Music Speak\\", and the title track clearly displayed that ABBA were taking their listeners to a new, more sophisticated place. And If we thought the lyrics were personal on \\"The Winner Takes It All\\", who dreamed we would be looking even deeper within via songs like \\"One Of Us\\", and \\"When All Is Said and Done\\", speaking to the pain, regret, and even forgiveness of love gone wrong.  \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" deals with the present day heartache a parent feels watching a child growing up,and regretting lost opportunities. This song's less harmony layered moment as Frida joins Agnetha at the beginning of verse two might be one of the closest things fans can get to \\"ABBA unplugged\\". This song ends with a clock ticking, that takes us to the last track, \\"Like An Angel Passing Through My Room\\", an ABBA lullaby that leaves fans wanting more of a style that pre-dated Enya. There is something about Frida's performances on this album that fans have consistently taken note of. It is credit to Bjorn and Benny's production values to be sure. Frida would have one more ABBA song to demonstrate her beautiful, soaring lead vocal stylings on a track called \\"Cassandra\\". This was recorded during ABBA's final sessions in 1982.  And while Frida would record her \\"Somethings Going On\\" solo album shortly after \\"The Visitors\\" release, it is the ABBA recordings directly before and after her solo effort that truly showcase her vocal talent. The ABBA singles collection that followed in 1982, bearing the title \\"The First 10 Years\\" certainly gave hope that more ABBA albums would follow. One can only imagine where the next sessions would have taken them.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the mini games are more fun than others (and a lot of games seem pretty similar).  Overall a good tine killer, though, and keeps you coming back simply to discover what sort of game you'll unlock next.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|I have come to really look forward to the Sherwood Pictures movies. I loved the first 3, Flywheel, Facing the Giants and Fireproof but Im sorry to say that this one came up short. The premise and the idea of the movie was clear but everything felt incomplete, not exactly sure how to explain it. Got a chuckle out of identifying actors among the extras from the other movies as I realize that only the people who are members of Sherwood Baptist are allowed to act in these movies. I felt that the \\"preachy\\" aspect of the movie got a bit thick, like a 2 hour sermon; even tho what they were saying was all true, it was too much. The other 3 films had scenes that didnt thump you in the head with a bible before it was over... all I kept thinking was, \\"I hope they haven't just started trying to PUMP OUT movies now that they have a name and sacrificing quality in the process\\".. Many reviews I read hashed on the acting... I know they are amateur actors and  with that said think they do a fine job and some have gotten better with each movie.  My advice is to rent this before you buy it and make your own informed decision... I bought it first, not saying I wouldnt have had I rented it but honestly I expected more from the Kendrick brothers... Am also awaiting then next one to see where they go from here.....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So love this app. I like that you have to play the games to earn enough points/money to unlock other games. excellent way to pass time!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just started playing this on my kindle, I love the details, the music &amp; background. Playing with the music in the background transports you to another time.  Very relaxing.
B0000UJL96|5.0|Not the best of the Star Trek movies but none the less a must to complete the set.I paid less than $8 and got it within days, very well packaged. Great Buy!
B0067Q42BY|3.0|really cool game but the ads for other games are sooo annoying! why pay for an app when there are ads? I got it for free but still, what up with the ads?!?!??
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I started watching this on PBS and then I received my copy from Amazon and I was ecstatic! I watched the whole series on a Saturday and I was not disappointed. This is a great series the writer and the actors are wonderful and I can't wait till the next one. This is great programming and we need more of it. I plan on watching both series over and over again.
B003G4W49C|4.0|enders game is one of the best sci fi books of all time. well at least thats what everyone says. i had to read this over the summer for my english class. when i returned to school in the fall all of my clssmates said they hated it because it was strange ad confusing. the plot overall is amazing and all of the details are outstanding but i just have to reccomend it to people over maybe 12 or 13 years old.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I had never heard of Manning before this app. I think it is very fun, and worth the money. In the game, there are 3 exciting modes.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really got hooked on this app. It was very entertaining. I liked the story.  It led me along a path and kept my interest.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is an amazing app u will love it it is perfect for any kid that wants a fun app to play with and plus its A FREE!!!!!
1572814136|2.0|Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews of the Radiant Rider-Waite Tarot, I've definitely got a minority opinion, but here goes:  I was terribly disappointed in this deck.  Yes, the colors are vibrant. Yes, the symbolism is identical to the classic Rider-Waite.  But the images themselves possess none of the artistry of the original.  They are poorly executed copies.  The faces of the people and archetypes in particular are dull, expressionless, lifeless.  Consequently I couldn't connect with the cards at all.  If anything, they gave me new appreciation for my old Rider-Waite deck, yellowed and tattered as it is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this game, its simple arcade style games are fun but sometimes challenging. definately a good game for mindless enjoyment:)
B002C2XXJY|5.0|This album is by far the best of her 3 albums. She portrays so many different feelings and is definitely more soulful. Her vocals are just great and the music is very catchy. I adore each one of the songs in this album because all of them are very original and each song is different. I highly recommend this album.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game was the app of the days while back so I didn't have to pay for it which is good but I would recommend. this game to almost any one..
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love the action and all the different nuts. I also like the store where you can buy different outfits!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Addicting :) so much fun when you get bored. Like all the different goals that you can achieve. Great job!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so addictive! When I first played it I played for 46 movies STRAIGHT! it is so awesome.
1439102724|5.0|I highly recommend \\"Sing You Home\\". It deals with two social issues that should be of importance to all of us - frozen embryos and same-sex marriage. The author does a good job of 'getting into mind' of a lesbian. She must have done quite a bit of research. Good Job.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun mixed withsuper fun and if you had it you would put five stars. I also recommend it to kids 8 and up
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am able to use Evernote across Mac and Windows to share, edit, and distribute documents. I was even able to copy and paste text of a long html document and make an Evernote doc that was editable and retained its web formatting. Cool!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game! It does lag a little but its really fun and very addictive. The little squirrel is adorable and the achievements keep it interesting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read for teens and adults alike! I love the perspective it gives readers on how frivolous 1st world countries can be while 3rd world citizens struggle to find food.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I agree, ads in a paid App are a bad way to go, you deserve to lose every customer you have.  The game itself is okay, except for previously noted requirement of the tutorial.  After a few rounds, got a pop to leave a review at Amazon Appstore... You're mistake!  Maybe this is why the filesize on Amazon is 4x what it is on the Market.  The only reason I gave it a look was because it's faotd.. Will be uninstalled very soon.  I will not be looking at G5's garbage anymore.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Even on a small screen, this was smartly crafted with many zoom levels to allow for easy gameplay and the graphics are an excellent addition.  You can choose from several game modes and/or difficulties as well.  Well done.
1401923127|4.0|This book fulfilled all of my expectations and more.  I am very pleased that I purchased this book. I feel that this book enriched my life.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy this game! It is fun and entertaining. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves puzzle games. A must for mahjong lovers!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Very enjoyable. Great time killer. But too addictive. Almost Angry Bird level fun.  (Need a few more words in this review to submit it.)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Thanks it is entertaining and beautifully designed. I would recommend for purchase but free is great. The artifacts add real interest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever! this game will ocupy you for hours and hours.  yeh this is awesome. best best best best _
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Would be better if opening screen just had a link to developer's site in the corner instead of a full screen add
B004B32532|2.0|I love this movie, its a 5 star, but....<br />I'm not sure whats going on with the other reviewers saying this is a great bright and vibrant blu-ray.<br />The one I received was in a clear case not the standard blue case typically used for blu-ray.<br />The one i got is bleached out it looks like a grey screen is over everything.<br />Big artifacts and compression marks at the beginning made me leave the room.<br />The scene of phenix in the white room with the tree shows big screen wide artifacts in the white wall, it looks like the film was cut in half then taped together.<br />Also since I left the room at that point to do something else I continued listening to the dvd and the sound is pretty crummy at points, sounds like distortion is all I can say.<br /><br />It doesn't look as good as my region 2 PAL anchor bay dvd release which has nice bright color.<br />Did I get a defctive disc? whats the problem here?
B006PAZMMK|2.0|Do yourself a favor and buy this on Beatport, Itunes, or another real music site. MP3s just don't do skrillex justice.. he deserves a better audio format.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like these games and that they are a bit challenging. I find it quit addictive. The more you play the more points you earn so you can have access to play more games.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Game is fun lots of levels! Can be addicting so watch out! I'm still trying yo beat the game but then ill need to go back and get 3 stars on every level.
B005OK725M|5.0|I enjoy movies that place women in the roles typically reserved for men. Zoe Saldana nails this role. I think this was an awesome movie and everyone should enjoy it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is addicting and is a great way to pass time. Great for car trips or waiting at doctors offices.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just downloaded game and it works great.  Have been looking for a quality solitaire game and this is it!  It has been a long time since I have played solitaire because a lot of the apps freeze up or do not work right but so far this app has woked perfect.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|One of the best mahjong games I have played.  glad I downloaded, put it on phone and Kindle Fire.  Great graphics
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Great movie for Xtmas or Valentines day, good linked stories, Bridget Jones style with more good actors, recommended as a gift or to share a hot chocolate any winter's eve
B0067Q42BY|1.0|While this looks like a very good game and I did get it as free app of the day I cannot keep it on my device because I refuse to allow a dev like this into my life. I feel that the keeping of this game on my device would be the same as supporting a developer like this. I cannot do that because this sets a horrible precedent. Devs like this need to be sent a strong message that they are not welcome on the android platform. Full versions of games or applications should never contain ads. I do not care if they are for other games that the developer makes. Ads are ads. In any paid app, they are unacceptable. when an application or game is good, I'll research out what else the dev makes anyway. But I insist that that be my choice. I am sure that the games that the developer makes are great but they will never see a penny of my money due to this practice.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great app! Good time passer! Love it! Great app! Good time passer! Love it! Great app! Good time passer! Love it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this mah jongg matching game, very much. The graphics are good. The only way this game could be better would be if it had the real four player game with it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I highly recommend this game. Definitely one of the better games I have loaded both fun and challenging. 5 stars.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|I love their bright young voices. Each song stands on it's own. No wonder they are such a hit!!  I'm looking forward to their next release.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|good way to present this game with an accompanying story line.  I find it interesting.  Like reading a comic book while playing majong.
0062119044|1.0|I was intrigued by the movie trailers and decided to get the book.  The son is just such a caricature of a demon--it's more science fiction than realistic.  How the mother doesn't get help sooner or commit such a son is where the plot lost me.  About 100 pages in, I looked to find out more about the writer--turns out she's not even a mother which explained so much of the absurd prose, none of which seemed reflective of any pregnant woman I've ever known including myself.  Also, she missed major details on things like schools--schools don't even accept children who aren't potty trained so to have an untrained 6 year old in the school system (especially a private school) was just unrealistic. So much for writing about what you know!   I turned to the book Columbine, which was written by Dave Cullen for a true look at psychypathy--it's about what caused the Columbine massacre and is a much more believable (and consequently useful) portrait.  The other piece that completely made this book seem like a complete waste of time was that I read Susan Klebold's piece in O magazine a few years ago (she's the mother of one of the Columbine killers)--that was an interesting piece because it showed that her son was completely normal growing up.  If Lionel Shriver was going to write about a child who becomes a school shooter, she should have at least done some research on depression and psychopathy.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|It's. not very challenging. You have to shuffle too much. Might be good for kids.  No thought went into puzzle making.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Better than the original Mahjong. Interesting story line along with playing the games. Hope there will be more games like this in the future.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Overall, very well done, although some song/artist combinations work better than others.  I have to give a special mention to the Ke$ha track - only the great William Shatner could do that better!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good game. I would recommend it for all my friends that have an electronic device that can download fun games like this.
1416575464|4.0|This is a lovely book! While some of the photos are a little dated, the design principles are lasting. It's a joy to look through and imagine how the approaches could be used in your own home.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so awesome I have so much fun vedging on the couch and playing it. my mom will say quit playing the game but I can't because I am addicted.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|deleted it due to the ads other then that play was ok maybe next time there will be no ads
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is very worth the 99 cents. even thouugh i got it as a free app of the day, it it a very addictive game. i played it on long car rides. very simple game... you fly around collecting nuts, dodging fireworks, glaciers, and owls. i like to buy outfits for the squirrel and accomplish goals. GET THE APP!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is the best game!  it is also like temple run on the ipod. I am glad I found this game on here!! if you like games that u have to not hit things and stay alive and u like animals or squirrels this is the game for you. its a game that you'll want to get a really high score on.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good. the games are fin and entertaining and keept me busy for a while. I give it a five star rating and recommend getting it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game as well as entertaining. Beautiful graphics, easy to learn how to play. Tutorial was fun too. Try this game it's great on kindle fire.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really love this game. the squirrels are sooooooooooooo cute.you and your whole family should buy this game. its good for parents too.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|So far this game is great.<br /><br />  This game works well on my HTC Merge, and from what i have seen, it is fairly ad-free. I did get the (free) paid version (thank you Amazon) and do not see what all the fuss is about. Upon opening the app you go to a preview screen which shows the other games \\"G5\\" offers and a play button for the game. That is it for ads and you ARE NOT prompted in game to buy anything etc. This works well on my phone, and does not require a bunch of unwanted permissions to use on your device.<br /><br />(edit 3-1-12) There is Quest mode and regular Game mode. The quest mode is comic book style, the game mode is neat (single game, no story) and you can choose tiles, boards, and backround to keep it interesting.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|The greatest TV experience ever!  I previously bought Planet earth set on DVD, unfortunately when I upgraded to a proper full HD TV the quality was not satisfying so I decided to get the Blu-Ray one and all I can say is \\"WOW\\" it is indeed a hell of an experience, a must watch for everyone.  Needless to say that the content of \\"Planet earth\\" is amazing, you know.. BBC + David Attenborough, Should we really expect less? :), it's a great source of information suitable almost for all the family, except for some 'nature cruelty' that may not be suitable for everyone.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I got into angry birds about two years ago and I play it every day on my kindle fire it is one of the best games. And who does not like flying birds into green pigs? Best game Ever
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Come on, I believe more than 99% of the people buying this have already seen the movies so I wont say anything about it.  * The set is well done, nice and sexy looking box.  * The video/audio quality is amazing!  * You'll really get what you paid for :).
B006ON41FC|5.0|it's so fun I love it!!!!!It's. the best app I ever bought!!!!I love it. you should buy it!!!!!If you like to be wild and crazy you should buy it!!!!!!!
B002R5QPRI|5.0|I typically don't watch movies more than once, but this one I had to and give me chills each time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is, so far very entertaining. I happened to check the app store and found it was free today. I had been wanting. to buy it and snagged it but I must say it would have been well worth the price and I will buy the other chapters....
B006ON41FC|5.0|i love this addicting game! It has an achievement system too and outfits for the squirrel. you collect nuts which you use to purchase gear with.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its awesome. its a flying squirl collecting nuts and more nuts. u can get cool outfits and devices to help you collect the nuts.  you're totally. go nuts!!!!
0062060562|5.0|Once I got into this book I had a hard time putting it down. It was a fast easy read and kept me interested and guessing. I loved it!Highly recommend it!
1594203334|3.0|The French don't have the monopoly on bringing up well behaved children.  American parents about 2 generations back and beyond also knew how to parent without making the child the center of the family.  I blame our bombardment of fast paced, get it now, media and electronic driven world we live in here in the U.S. for today's spoiled, entitled child.
B004WR125O|1.0|Difficult to set up.  If you don't know that you have to let the USB feature in the receiver initialize first, you will have a set up menu displayed that is non functional.  Apparently the pass phrase for security in your router can't be longer than 8 characters.  I couldn't connect it to my router but did connect it to my cell phone wireless hot spot.  With the phone right next to the receiver it told me the signal strength was 48%.  Onkyo shouldn't even be selling this.  It's worthless.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I got this app for free one day. It is a lot more fun than I expected. Would I pay $0.99 for it? Yes. It also works great on my Xoom.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The graphics in this game are fantastic. The game play is very good with good controls, I highly recommend this app.
0062082353|1.0|With two co authors, you would expect a well witten,compelling story.  Unfortunately, this is a boring story about a very fine Navy SEAL.  Every incident is described without any sense of danger or suspense. There is no single kill of epic proportions that will compare with the sniper to sniper encounters of WW II or Vietnam.  I cannot recommend this book, but highly respect the man for his courage and skill.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|By far one of the best mahjong games that this app store has. Even better since it was free for a day.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I'm glad I downloaded this app because its so addicting and is great for passing the time anywhere, anytime. I recommend this game strongly.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game, better than most Great graphics and sound too. Multiple levels and a story line make this mahjong unique
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have this on my computer and am jazzed to be able to play on my kindle. would recommend to others. next game to watch for is jewel quest or treasure of Montezuma 3
B006B31B80|5.0|This show is a great balance between action, story, sex, and suspense. I usually don't allow myself to get sucked into shows that you have to watch all the episodes to understand but let me tell you this one is AMAZING.... There are constant twisting plots, friction between characters and character personality changes you would never expect. Overall I rate it 5 stars. Not for the well done zombie outfits or gore but because this show will keep you coming back for more. Very well done.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like the comic book type story line. easy to use and good for beginners and skilled players. I like that you can skip the storyline and just play a quick game.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Except for the appearance of cheap celebrity Nick Jonas, this is a great cast and well filmed.  We can't get enough of it.  :)
B00000J0O2|5.0|HP brand is top rate in consistent quality and value.  This unit installs easily and gives you top rate print quality from the first copy.
1609611543|4.0|I started the book and gave my copy to my daughter, ordered another book for myself. Liked what I read.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Nice game, to many ads for a paid version. Playing with wild cards is different for me. I guess I am old school
0880796863|3.0|I bought this for my dad and I had to buy him an accompanying book as this one was not very user friendly.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I like this type of game. I could play this and not get anything else done. Thank you! Keep up the great work.
B003L77G8I|2.0|The writers of this show must be moonlighting from their regular jobs on a soap opera. The characters are so poorly developed they make the Real Housevives seem deep in comparision. The stories are cardboard and the 'science' is about as believable as an episode of The Jetsons. Truly awful and getting worse each season.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun mahjong game for all ages to enjoy. Works fine in my samsung evo iv g. Recommend you download today. Enjoy.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love Mahjong and this game makes it a little more challenging and interesting playing. I would recommend this game.
B006SVHOL8|3.0|Same old plot as \\"Outbreak\\".  Movie slow, and a waste of excellent actors. Thought \\"Outbreak\\" was better with Hoffman, Freeman, etc.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The adds are when the game is launched. G5 and others do this. It really is not that big of a deal. The game it's self is very good. Works just fine on my Kindle Fire.  I still do not like the 20 word min.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so cool I never thought that it would ne this cool. you should get it its awesome
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun game. concentration needed. free, so not bad, i still need a few more words just to sumbit this so now i,m just rambling to fill in space.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very fun. I like to try to earn different swords in the dojo then in Sensai's Swag. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME.
B0063IH60K|5.0|spent a lot of toilet time with this app on my kindle. definitely recommend it for some quality time by yourself.
1619492881|3.0|Howards End is a look at the philosophical and socioeconomic state of England prior to World War I.  It is essentially told from three points of view: 1). The Schlegel family, wealthy and progressive with socialist ideals, 2). The Wilcox family , wealthy, \\"old school\\" traditionalists, and 3). Leonard Bast, a lower middle class young man seeking to better himself both culturally and socially.  Slowly their stories (both past and present) become intertwined and their varying opinions are thrown into stark relief... sometimes in surprising ways.  All the while, periodic philosophical discussions take place about wealth, society, gender equality, death.  Meh.<br /><br />While it makes for an interesting study of the society and ideals of the time, the essential lack of plot in Howards End left me yawning my way through much it.  There wasn't even enough witty dialogue to make up for the lack of action. On Beauty at least had some killer dialogue.  As was the case with On Beauty, there is a huge cast of characters, some of whom are well-developed and many of whom barely exist beyond their names and basic relationship to the others. Margaret and Helen, whom the story tends center around,  are the only fully developed characters.  The others came off as flat and one dimensional.  While Howards End made for an interesting period study, its limited characterization and even more limited plot still made it an essentially unsatisfying read.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: I know it's a classic, but Howards End did very little for me.  Mildly interesting at best.<br /><br />This discussion originally appeared on my blog.  See my profile for details.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This seems to be a great app thus far. I can get to verses quickly during worship services. There is easy access to books, chapters, and verses at the top of my Kindle Fire with this app! I look forward to using it especially on Sundays. Thanks for a great freebie!
B006ON41FC|5.0|very fun and addicting! I think You should get this app.I play it all the time. I love it!! get this app!
B004SBX112|5.0|Dear Rovia I am a huge fan of angry birds I have an idea for a new angry birds game its called angry birds history. in this game you would have different time periods in American history and the art in the game would tell which time period it was. I hope you will consider pitching my idea.:)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|i really enjoy mahjong. this app is great as its easy to navigate. great colors and sounds. i can play my favorite game on the go!
B007B8GI28|5.0|\\"Triggerfinger\\" is the second episode in the second half of Season 2 of  AMC networks Zombie thriller \\"The Walking Dead\\"<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />This episode picks up where the last left off, as it follows Rick, Hershel and Glen and concludes with a gunfight at the deserted tavern in the near dark. Spooky and tense on its own, but terrifying when you realize that the Zombies are never very far away. The results look to make a significant impact back at the farm. Also featured is Lori's car wreck and her harrowing tale of her escape while encountering some Zombies.<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />In addition to the two main story lines mentioned above, this episode features a lot of raw emotion being shown between several individuals... emotions that seem sure to lead to more internal conflicts between our original survivors and the farm denizens as well.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Again, great acting and a near perfect blend between action and drama. A story of survival... and survival means avoiding Zombies when possible and killing them when it's not. Great directing and outstanding camera work that captures those fleeting emotional nuances that come and go in a split second.<br /><br />A great series; a great individual episode.<br /><br />5 Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
B0067Q42BY|5.0|l really like this. game and to think it. was free on my FIRE. IT HELPS TO CALM ME WHEN I AM NERVOUS
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|This is a crude crass very loud and obnoxious film.  The writers of this movie should never work again.  I hate it when movies are this dumbed down.  When will they get it that criminals screaming and swearing nonstop is niether scary nor suspensful.  I cannot remember the last time I heard the F bomb used so many times in a single movie.

B004GGM444|5.0|I hate listening to 30 second previews sometimes because you never get a good feel for the songs (or the albums) flow or composition. With that being said I am enjoying this album. There is a lot to be said for the modern Dub step (it will always be a form of DnB/Jungle to me....lol)  Skrillex is making use of the various modern music tech & techniques for sure, that's why I love this album....great album.
B005M48WNQ|5.0|This book is extremely profound.  My husband has read Jonathan's fiction novels and enjoyed his style of writing.  He came home with this book as a gift for me since he knows I like to have a connection to where my food comes from.  Little did I know what I was getting myself in to when I opened this book.  It took a few chapters, but I don't think I will ever look at a living animal the same again.  This book brings the reality of factory farming in to clear view.  Eating meat may be a natural human instinct but eating deformed animals that can't even reproduce on their own or survive on their own is the furthest thing from natural.  Eating animals that are tortured and suffered horribly beyond your worst nightmare might make you think differently next time you cook up that chicken from a factory farm.  There are ways we can take part in not supporting the horrible treatment of these innocent animals.  We need to support the farms that humanely treat their animals.  Read this book and open your eyes to the world of processed packaged animals we call meat.

0061733199|5.0|This is pretty much a direct ripoff of several survival guides produced by our armed forces, so if you have enlisted friends, you can probably get all of this for free. Nonetheless, if you want it all in one package, this is a well structured book, and contains information to aid in survival. If you want a preview of this book, and have a smart phone, do an app search, and you should be able to find plenty of apps that'll give you an idea of what is offered here. The bonus to having this: you don't have to recharge a book, so one less worry when the zombies attack
B004EPYZSK|3.0|Not sure exactly what to say other than, it was entertaining and that is what movies a made for??? Oh yes, and money too!  Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are (of course) Excellent in their respective roles.  The movie itself kind of lets you go to many times, atleast 3.  So after the first (dis-charge) you are kind of lost in movie-land outer-space.  It is a solid 3 stars, but beware they lose touch with the viewer far to many times to get a (real) grip of the story-line.  It is worth the 3 Bucks to rent, but to Buy??? \\"I think not\\"

B004EPYZV2|5.0|I have a huge collection of Tom Cruise movies including the first 3 M.I DVD's, but without a doubt Ghost Protocal is the best of the four. Tom is just an incredible actor and this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat...Highly recommended 5 stars.  Jeremy Renner is very credible in his role. If you purchase this movie you will not regret it...Your Mission, if you choose to accept it is to pre order this movie...this message will self destruct in 5 seconds.

B007B8GI28|5.0|This was the best course correction episode ever. David Johnson (writer) really outdid himself from his previous effort \\"Chupacabra\\" where Daryl was acting irrationally and against character. It was a bad tee shot, but not the worst of the series. And he made up for it. Here, both the farm and the bar storylines progress with characters talking and acting sensibility, solving little but important plot problems (these two guys we killed have friends outside!), and all using the storyteller's creed: show the audience, don't just tell us. The pontificating of characters, even when accurate, was dogging this show. Badly. Slowing the pace of everything else while we were told, seemingly endlessly, about the problems of group living, security, welfare, children, etc. Now however, we get to see why. My interest was piqued the entire episode, which has not happened since season one. Every person on screen added something to the plot, their own exposition made sense (Glenn and Shane most notably), and most importantly of all, actual ACTION happened to help move events from A to B. And that's the thing: this is a zombie show, no argument. (The cheek scraping off in the car was gruesomely awesome.) But this was a believable zombie show episode, and that has been rare this season.

1451627289|5.0|I have long been a fan of Stephen King. I've read his greatest, great, and not so great offerings. I was completely drawn into this novel from the first page. I am always amazed at the way King crafts his novels and I wasn't disappointed here. He managed to tie up all the loose ends to my reading and reasoning satisfaction. I laughed, I cried and I was truly sorry to have the story come to an end. I think this will be a book that I re-visit from time to time for the sheer pleasure of the trip into the past.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I've been using the PX21s daily for a little over a year now.  While I really like them and enjoy the sound when playing games, they aren't as good as they could be.  If you are playing with a bluetooth phone headset, do everyone a favor and at least upgrade to these.  They ARE worth the money but be gentle with them.  Here are my only real complaints about the headset.  1.  Sound is sometimes confusing.  You will hear someone near you but its difficult to tell where they are.  2.  The ear cups are designed to swivel.  Its a great feature, however, its poorly executed.  Both of my swivels broke.  My sister's broke and so did my coworkers.  This seems to be an incredibly common problem and after taking the headsets apart, I see why.  The plastic for the that part of the headset gets so thin, that it can't stand any perpendicular pressure.  Turtle Beach could remedy this by substituting just that area with a small piece of aluminum or zinc rather than plastic.  It would make the headset a couple of dollars more expensive but it would be worth it. I've been able to reassemble both sides of my headset by using some quick setting Loctite plastic epoxy.  I use the epoxy around the joint and so it doesn't swivel anymore but they still function fine without that capability.  If you do buy these, be very cautions with those joints and buy some plastic epoxy just in case.

I did not give five stars because I thought there should have been more \\"Extra\\" Material Other than that I would say anyone who is a Floyd fan Definitely buy this its worth it if you just still have that old VHS hanging around!

B00005JPSM|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of remade movies, and this one reinforces my bias.  For me, this tried too hard to parallel MM (in some places almost word for word) while showing a shinier, \\"Hollywood-er\\" version of the story.  Not too bad if you haven't seen MM, but NOWHERE near as good a cover as, for example, \\"Tortilla Soup\\" following on \\"Eat, Drink, Man, Woman\\"
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I have never been fond of the Dualshock controller, so I was excited to see this Xbox-style controller for the PS3.  The Pro Elite Wireless Controller is by no means a replica Xbox 360 controller, or even an Xbox 360 replacement for the PS3, but if you're a gamer who prefers the Xbox 360 controller layout, then this is definitely worth a look.  Here's my side by side observations of the Pro Elite vs the Dualshock vs the Xbox 360 controller:  LOOK & FEEL:  First to note is that the Pro Elite is larger than the Dualshock controller.  It is approximately the same size and shape as an Xbox 360 controller, but it is lighter in weight than the Xbox controller (about the same weight of a Dualshock), has textured handle grips, and orange glowing buttons.  I don't mind the grip except to say that it's a little rough on your hands after you've gripped it tightly for a few hours.  However, I find the Xbox-inspired ergonomic styling of the body easier and more comfortable to hold than the Dualshock controller.  The Pro Elite's thumb stick placement is more in keeping with the Xbox controller rather than the Dualshock.  All the buttons glow orange and have the corresponding PS3 symbol on them.  If you are used to the Dualshock button placement, you won't have any trouble with them not being color-coded.  The thumb sticks are about as 'firm' as the Dualshock, which is to say, a little softer than the Xbox controller.  I prefer the Xbox-style placement of these thumb sticks over that of the Dualshock.  I have not experienced any 'dead zone' -- I am not saying it's not there, as other reviewers have noted, just that I have not experienced it.  I mostly play games like \\"Uncharted\\" and \\"Infamous\\" and some puzzle games.  The triggers are still Dualshock-style (ie: recessed backwards), but I added some [[ASIN:B001AW156U Pelican PS3 Dual L / R Triggers Controller Attachments for Playstation 3]] to them, which helps jut them forward.  The dual rumble is very nice, and seems comparable with the Dualshock in intensity.  SETUP:  The Pro Elite Wireless Controller requires a receiver dongle to be plugged into the front of your PS3, and paired with the controller (synced) to use.  Once synced, it as a good wireless range for any room.  Although this version of the Pro Elite is wireless, it charges through this dongle via a cable, and while charging, I found the cord way too short to be able to charge and play comfortably.  Also, the dongle must remain plugged into the front of your PS3 at all times (when using the Pro Elite).  CONCLUSION:  Being a gamer who prefers the Xbox-style controller, I could not be happier with the Pro Elite Wireless Controller for my PS3.  It suits my play style and I'm glad I found it.
B004D2GMR6|4.0|Great concert, but the last 3 songs, You give love a bad name, Runaway and Bed of Roses, which are listed on the cover are not in the concert.  How does this happen?

0062082353|3.0|To keep this review short, thank you CPO Kyle for your service to our country. You saved countless American lives on the battlefield. Men are alive today because of your actions.  The book seems like it was slapped together with strings of firefights and personal thoughts. The writing style is one dimensional. Had Chris waited at least 5-10 years to have his story digest, and settle with his emotions, it might have been a better book with more depth to it. Seems like the publisher wanted to jump on the Marcus Luttrell SEALs band wagon and cash in on the money. If you're former military, it will appeal to you. If you're a civilian, you might be put off by his bravado. Which he earned.

B006XB267K|3.0|I generally love the time slip episodes but this one was the worst. The story plot was a bigger 'meh' and it really had no purpose, unless you think the 30 seconds of \\"future telling\\" was worth the whole episode.  The other time travel episodes seemed to be more poignant to the over arching plot but this was the general \\"hunt bad thing\\" episode. This is the sort of thing you get when you try to pull a time travel plot line one time too many. The conclusion (how Dean got home) seemed very deus ex machina.
B003TH2LA8|5.0|This series is well done, right amount of action and intrigue.  Very much enjoyed the entire season (and season 2 as well).  Thank you Amazon!

0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha is one of the most famous novels of all time. It follows the physical and spiritual life a man from his youth into adulthood. While Siddhartha does have a narrative arc, it feels generous to call this a novel, not because of its length, but because it is more or less a vehicle for Herman Hesse to pass down his particular philosophy. That's not to say Siddhartha is bad, in fact my translation by Hilda Rosner, is particularly beautiful. Also, the three main characters of the novel are fascinating and, despite what others might say, are, to me, three dimensional.<br /><br />It is said that Siddhartha parallels that of the Buddha himself, and from what I know that's true enough. But I think this book is worthy of another comparison: Ecclessiastes. Both contain wisdom from a man who has experienced everything. The major difference is that, while Ecclesiastes, minus the last few verses, by in large interprets life pessimistically, Siddhartha interprets life in an eternal optimism.<br /><br />Strong critics of eastern philosophy won't have their minds changed by this one. At the same time, I think it is impossible to call Siddhartha anything but life-affirming. It is clear that Hesse had a very profound way of looking at the world.

B0050PYNN0|4.0|I passed on this movie when it came out as the reviews were lukewarm.  It's now playing on HBO and I found myself laughing a lot.  It's raunchy and sophmoric - so if you don't like that sort of humor (e.g., The 40-yr Old Virgin, The Naked Gun), then you won't like this film.  The acting, especially from Justin Theroux, was spot on, although some of the accents weren't (e.g., James Franco).  The dialogue (esp with Justin Theroux again) was priceless.  All the supporting characters were cast well but in particular, Rasmus Hardiker, the long suffering sidekick of Daniel McBride's character, an actor I never was familiar with. I don't understand why the reviews weren't more favorable. I'm sorry now that I didn't see the movie when it came out and now I'm thinking of getting the actual DVD.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and addicting. I love it. It gets challenging after about 2,490 meters but still extremely fun.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Critics who claim that the second season of \\"Downton Abbey\\" is lackluster compared to Season 1 don't know what the hell they are talking about. I cannot get enough of this show! It continued to blow me away week after week. I will admit that some of the storylines are a bit more predictable and cliche, but who cares?! It's still an amazing show! I don't want to give too much away, but it's obvious to anyone who knows anything about this show that World War I has arrived, and it doesn't leave Downton Abbey untouched. Meanwhile, Lady Mary struggles with her feelings for Matthew, who shows up at Downton with fiancee Lavinia in tow. Meanwhile, Lady Sybil gets dangerously cozy with the chauffeur, Lord Grantham gets a bit too comfortable with the new maid, Isobel becomes even more annoying, and the Dowager Countess gets in more wisecracks in eight episodes than David Letterman manages in an entire year. Those are just some of the highlights of this season of \\"Downton Abbey,\\" which is FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!!!! It is by far the best show on television today. If you aren't watching it, shame on you.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I really like this game. The game is simple but addictive. Great for passing time, if u hit a tree u just want to try again. And no system issues with the epic.

B005OCFGTO|3.0|We bought this for Christmas, so we didn't watch them in time to correct the problem with the order. Of course the movies are great, it was the DVD selection that's the problem. When customers buy DVDs, they automatically assume the DVDs are for home use, not the ones bought to rent to people. Now we're stuck with ten minutes of trailers for other movies coming out at the time each individual Harry Potter movie was released, along with a commericial for the Harry Potter game associated with that particular movie (or the still-hasn't-opened-website \\"Pottermore.\\") \\"Coming soon to a theatre near you\\" or \\"Coming soon on DVD\\" fills a good ten minutes of our time, before the actual movie starts. Worse yet, there is no pause between the coming attractions (now all old movies) and the start of the movie, so we're stuck hoping we don't have to watch every single commericial, while waiting for the movie to start.<br /><br />This is from Amazon, not from a third party, but apparently even Amazon was in such a rush to get this \\"8-film collection\\" out in time for Christmas, so they cheated on which movies to send. I can only assume when the \\"Collection Set\\" comes out, they will do a better job, but after this I recommend not to trust Amazon for their movies.<br /><br />If you don't want the same problem, make sure you check your DVDs, when they first arrive. Heaven forbid, you give these knock offs as a present to someone a month or so later - you're stuck with them, because it's too late to return them. Always check Amazon movies for this problem immediately.

0312323867|4.0|(same tandem review from \\"Something Borrowed\\"): I actually read this book in tandem with \\"Something Borrowed\\", and I'm really glad I did. I started out liking Rachel and disliking Darcy (in both novels), but as they progressed I found myself liking Darcy more and more, and getting angrier with Rachel. It's possible that I just appreciated the changes that Darcy made with her approaching motherhood, but I also found myself getting irritated with Rachel's predictable mooning over her ex-best friend's fiancé, and with how she justified sleeping with him by bringing up every little slight she ever suffered from Darcy.  In the end, Darcy grew up, prioritized, and kept her colorful personality while becoming a better person. Rachel stayed vanilla and uninteresting.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Great product.  Works well to score round glass bottles.  Takes a little practice to get the scoring right.  The trick is to use oil every 2-3 bottles on the diamond tip and apply even pressure when scoring.  I've made some really great decorations with old bottles.
1451627289|5.0|OK, I'm a Stephen King fan, though I have read only half of his work.  I have had misgivings about the excessive length of much of his fiction, supposing that his record as a best-selling author has kept editors from tightening novels that, with a different author's name on them, might have been shortened considerably.  But that's not entirely fair, since much of the length of his books comes from the care he takes to make his characters \\"real\\" to his readers, and this is as much a Stephen King trademark as his often macabre themes.<br /><br />Although \\"11/22/63\\" is one of his longest yet, for me it was one of the most satisfying.  First, it was a superior foray into the time travel genre, which has always appealed to me.  Second, Mr. King's evident nostalgia for the period in question overlaps greatly with my own, being of similar ages.  And finally, although there are good guys and bad guys aplenty, this is not a novel in which a supernatural and evil force is the enemy.  Rather, our hero Jake Epping/George Amberson is up against a past that simply resists change.  As he repeatedly says, \\"The past is obdurate.\\"<br /><br />(Minor Spoilers Follow)  The first, lengthy section of the book is devoted to Jake's efforts to prove whether the past can be changed, and is a book unto itself.  Having satisfied himself on that point, he then embarks on an effort to pin down as much as possible whether Oswald was acting alone.  That is, if he wasn't alone, a quest to prevent JFK's assassination by stopping Oswald might be fruitless.  He then seeks to stop Oswald.  The final section seemed a bit rushed in comparison, but was satisfying nonetheless.  There is an attempt to provide an explanation of how time travel works and its consequences, but it was not the book's strongest part for me.<br /><br />In short, if you like time travel fiction, this is about as good as it gets, and if you like Stephen King's writing, this is Mr. King at the top of his game.

0553582038|2.0|So after killing off half the characters, Martin decides that really the best way to divvy up his monster series is to provide us with a story with only the remaining characters we don't like?<br /><br />Ok don't get me wrong, Jaime has alot of development, Cersei is certainly interesting reading and Brienne is A-OK.<br /><br />But quite frankly I suspect Martin realised that fourth books in epic fantasy series are always terribly bland and because he is a compelling accomplished author, he needed to do something drastic to not buck the trend.<br /><br />The most frustrating thing is that his lack of attention to the more interesting characters in the series is explained at the end, not sure whether its an apology or a stout F U

1451629184|5.0|I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for Jaycee to share such intimate details of her time in captivity with the world. Sometimes people can be judgmental, even blaming the victim for not getting away.<br /><br />That is more troubling to me than anything. There is a systematic approach to brainwashing a victim into submissiveness which also makes them afraid to leave their captor. It's a very complicated situation and angers me that a victim is judged in this way.<br /><br />Thank you for printing her story, I hope there is healing in the pages for her, her family and her children.
B007B8GI28|2.0|With this episode, it becomes clear that Shane's mask of sanity is lowly slipping and that he has turned almost delusional with regard to Lori and the baby that he thinks is his. Delusional in the Fatal Attraction sort of way. He is starting to think that he and Lori really had something deep and meaningful going on during those couple of weeks where they thought Rick was dead and it looks like confrontation with Rick is going to be inevitable as Shane is slowly losing it. In fact, it looks like Shane is going to mix it up with someone soon and pull the trigger again. Maybe it is the trauma that ensues from living in a world post apocalypse where everything you have ever known is gone or maybe it is because Shane has always been kind of unstable, violent and and an a_hole and it is all surfacing just now that this thin veneer we call civilization has vanished.  Whatever it is, Shane is \\"falling down\\" and it becomes increasingly more clear to everyone that they're gonna have to worry about him just as they have to with Walkers. I used to root for Shane because what he said made sense, but he has pretty much crossed the line into instability and psychosis and he will be dangerous.  As I write this, I realize how truly ridiculous and boring this show has turned otherwise. I mean, the main point of contention seems to be the love triangle and the ever prevailing \\"who is the father of my baby\\" question. The other characters have sort of been moved to the background as we hardly ever hear anything from them anymore and it seems to be the \\"love birds\\" (Shane, Rick and Lori/Glenn and Maggie) whose storylines matter. Everyone else seems to be serving in a merely ornamental capacity or to move the storyline along (like Dale every now and then serving as a voice of caution to warn others just so he can go back to what he did, whatever that might be. Or T-Dog whose role has been reduced to that of scene filler at this point, or Andrea whose character and its agony, which had been so beautifully initiated, have been reduced to some one dimensional \\"extra\\", loading dead bodies into trucks or running errands).  I dont know why everyone says that there is great character development, when the only characters who are being developed, if you can call it that, are the \\"Romantics\\".  Carol and Darrell also always seem to be having the same \\"conversation\\" - and with that I mean Darrell throwing a hissy fit like a child who lost his puppy after a week's search and don't want loving anyone no more anymore, calling everyone a \\"bit/ch\\" while Carol gives him teary eyed looks or throws a line at him and walks away, just so they can resume where they left off the next time. Yes i understand Darrell is hurt that the search for Sofia ended so tragically, but he's been just  grunting into the camera for the last three episodes with no end in sight. Hardly character development.  This episode was 2 stars tops, mainly because it is just not moving along - just as apparently the entire second season and because this show is no longer really about what it set out to be. The zombie background is purely incidental. It could be WWIII or a natural disaster or hey, even Melrose Place.  So in summary, that soapy, stagy love triangle drama and who is the father of my baby plot lines have degraded this show to just another soap opera but in a zombie setting as opposed to a more contemporary one. I mean really? A jilted lover vowing to take revenge and becoming psychotic is nothing original, even if it is set against a zombie backdrop. Whereas season 1 and even the beginning of season 2 (i.e. before they landed on this \\"Farm of our Discontent\\") were looking at the problem of a world ravaged by disease and having come to an end (note the flashbacks they had about how it all started), most of season 2 has unfortunately been about the marital problems of Rick and Lori and Shane's insanity. How the apocalypse began, what Jenner said, all those discussions about the human soul, whether there are any last outposts left and just the setting, which after all is one of zombies, have been muted.  It really no longer is about the end of the world. It is about petty people who seem to have missed the memo about the world having come to an end and who, as a result, engage in these petty quarrels with one another as if nothing had changed.  This show was great because it looked at the whole picture: zombie apocalypse, the struggle to survive and character development, the science behind the disease, the grander questions of survival, traversing the tough road. Now it is just focusing on the personal dramas of a few characters who seem to live in their own bubbles. Disappointed is an understatement. They writers go on like this and this show will get cancelled mid season 3. It is a shame because it was so damn good in the beginning.  For people who enjoy this kind of whiny, cranky stuff, it will be just fine and you'll like it, but for people looking for more depth and just something filled with less cliches and predictable story lines, I am afraid you will be disappointed. I was.
0312370849|5.0|The switiching time sequences are well done and would fit well into a David Mamet film.<br />If 80% of this novel is true, then you will discover some unpleasant things about the French-Nazi cooperation in the early days of the Nazi-Paris occupation. Very impactful. Going back to Paris in May 2012 for the elections and will make a point to look up the location of the embarrassinly small memorial plaque where the Veledrome used to be. Excellent first effort by this author. The book is far superior to the film so if you saw the film, do yourself a favor and order the book from Amazon. If you haven't seen the movie, don't go see it! Buy this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is awesome because it really never ends you keep on playing. but its should be better if you could do more things.
B00004WQ3A|5.0|I decided to buy this purely because I'm a huge NIN fan and when I stumbled upon it at such a cheap price I had to buy it.  The package came in about 2 weeks (shipping to Ireland, 10 working days) despite being told it could be 18-36 working days. Pleasant surprise! I opened the package when I got in from college and was so surprised at how pristine the package was. It was as if there wasn't even a scratch on the plastic that housed to vinyl sleeve. I'm not going to lie, it was like freakin' christmas! haha  one thing that did disappoint me is the fact the art that is displayed on older TDS vinyls didn't appear, as it appears to be some anniversary of the all black vinyl or some crap, I didn't pay too much heed. This vinyl was never something I planned on playing, and I'm going to keep it safe, but as you can expect with vinyls, they're becoming a rarity. The most important part about getting this product is that everything is done in such a clean, crisp manner and everything is taken care of properly. I've never gotten a package in such mint condition before. Would definitely recommend for any NIN looking for the vinyl.

B0045HCJR6|2.0|I've spent years avoiding SINGING IN THE RAIN. I can't really explain why it never caught my interest despite recommendations from friends. I've been trying to catch up on classic films so it was time for SINGING IN THE RAIN.<br />After having just seen THE ARTIST, I was amazed at how much Jean Dujardin looks like a young Gene Kelly and how much THE ARTIST and SINGING IN THE RAIN have in common. Both are set in the late 20's and involve movie stars silent actors dealing with the transition into \\"talkies.\\"<br />The similarities end there but I noticed how much the two films have in common minus the musical aspects.<br />It is a joy watching the enthusiastic and acrobatic dancing of Gene Kelly amd DOnald O'Connor. Both were rare talents whose likes will never been seen again.<br />Unfortunately, I found the movie to be long and unexciting. I recognized a few songs but overall they were bland and uninteresting. The most fun of the film was watching a young and perky Debbie Reynolds driving around in her 20's era convertible.<br />I had to look hard to find Rita Moreno in the film. Cyd Charisse gets top billing even though she is in the GOTTA DANCE routine as the \\"dancer\\" who never speaks. This scene drags on and on and does highlight the dancing talents of Kelly and Charisse.<br />I'm not a fan of dance musicals but I wanted to like this film. It is famous and beloved by so many yet it just was a big disappointment to me. There's a talented cast in an uninspired story.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a very good book overall but I have to say as a fan of the Kennedy's I would have liked to see the new world as a better world if not the same as it is now if Kennedy would have lived and not the dark horrible world it portrayed (if he did live).  That is my only complaint about the book.  I purchased this in hopes to find that Stephen King liked Kennedy as well and life would have been better not worse if Kennedy wasn't assissinated.  Sorry!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I have been playing this since I downloaded it yesterday.  Classic mode is great, and quest mode is a nice change of pace.  Definitely recommend it!

0143117009|4.0|Diamond uses a comparative study to uncover why some societies fail for environmental reasons while others succeed.  As such Diamond looks to case studies.  He uses a five-point framework to do so.<br /><br />Collapsed societies: Easter Island, Pitcairn Island & Henderson Island, the Anasazi in the American Southwest, the Mayans, and Norse Greenland.<br />Success stories: Tikopia, the New Guinea highlands, and the Japan of the Tokugawa Era.<br />Modern case studies: southwestern Montana, Rwanda, Dominican Republic, China, and Australia.<br />Five-point Framework: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trading partners, and the society's response to its environmental problems.<br /><br />Diamond believes that these collapses were not inevitable.  Nor are they the mere province of less \\"advanced\\" societies.  Key to establishing this are the three chapters on Norse Greenland, a medieval European society that failed while the Intuit society occupying the same landmass survived.  Diamond posits persuasively it was because of the choices made by the individual societies.<br /><br />Diamond has no sacred cows.  He's willing to explode the myth of indigenous people living in concert with nature.  Nor is he willing to give business (err, \\"big business\\") a pass.  They gets a fair shake.  Diamond finds that Big Oil, that old bugaboo, isn't a very big polluter these days.  Far, far more problematic is surface mining.<br /><br />This is economic destruction on the micro, not macro, scale.  The public conversation on environmental issues has become dominated by global warming.  Deforestation and similar issues can still catastrophically wreck an environment on their own.<br /><br />Collapse is a dry read.  The format largely forces this, although it also allows Diamond to lay out his case in a systematic manner.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game provides a long gameplay with several levels, comics, and artifacts for you to earn. Several reviewers have complained about the page of ads you're introduced to when you first open this app, but it's not at all a problem. If you really can't press one very large button to reach the wonderful game that you expected, then this really isn't for you. Mahjong Artifacts has many levels for you to solve. After each level, you receive an artifact (or piece of artifact) towards your goal. As the first comic tells you, the adventurer who gathers every artifact will earn 'god-like' powers. I'll leave you to learn more about that yourself. Each new level brings a new comic page relating to the next artifact you must 'find' in the adventure. l  In the levels of Mahjong, you are given several options if you find yourself getting stuck. You can shuffle the board, request a hint, or change the visibility of the board to see which are valid moves. The first two options require a small point fee, but nothing more than that. I've put plenty of time into Mahjong Artifacts, and I don't think I'm even halfway through yet! This app will definitely keep you occupied in your freetime. I downloaded this Mahjong game for the free app of the day, but it's definitely worth it if you're willing to spend five bucks.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book in this series was not a disappointment. It was interesting to see what happened to the main characters, especially Katniss as she was struggling with her personal demons and the realization that there is a fine line between friends and enemies. Loved this trilogy. It was a quick read that draws you in and makes you think.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just a great game to pass time when waiting for kids or in the car waiting for food ... ext...
B004HO6I2E|5.0|If you like humor similar to that found in The Hangover, and aren't easily offended, you will definitely enjoy The Change-up.  Ryan Reynolds plays the epitome of adult immature slacker (think grown up Van Wilder, with a Pontiac Fiero in lieu of the golf cart), while Bateman plays his polar opposite - hot successful wife, three kids, big house, fancy car, and blooming associate about-to-turn-partner at a law firm.  Naturally, its quite a shock to both of them when they end up switching bodies and lives.  What really impressed me was the ability of each actor to seemlessly make the transition from the characters they spend the first 10-15 minutes establishing, to spending the remaining 90 minutes or so as the complete opposite.  Plus, despite all the hilarious humor - if you don't think poop is funny, don't bother watching this movie - there is actually a deeper meaning to the story.  I thought this movie was great, really enjoyable, and once I saw it via Redbox, I couldn't wait to buy it for my very own.

B0015DYIH2|2.0|Breaking Dawn is by far the best, and most adult, book of the four that make up the Twilight Saga.  By now, you've read the first three, so the inevitable conclusion and epic battle must take place.  Meyer still has a few surprises up her sleeve however, when the Cullen family becomes larger in number in a manner nobody expects, especially when Meyer neatly packages up the werewolves in a bow just in time for the Cullens to defend the family home.

B005MYEQ4U|2.0|Let me make a prediction. I'll tell you the plot of Woody Allen's next movie: Slightly dorky guy is in love with an impossibly beautiful woman, a woman much too pretty for him. He can't trust the relationship, so he goes to great lengths to sabotage it.  I can make this prediction fearlessly, because this is the only film Woody Allen makes. People who say he has made 40 other movies are wrong. He has made one movie 40 times. He has used 40 different titles and 40 different sets of details and perhaps 200 different actors (some of whom he recycles from movie to movie), but he has only ever used one plot. It's a huge mystery to me why people can't seem to see this. Every year he makes the same movie again; every year it's hailed as a new movie and nominated for a bunch of Oscars. Where is your head, America?  \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is yet another iteration of the one-and-only Woody Allen movie. Slightly dorky guy (Owen Wilson) is in love with a woman much too beautiful for him (Rachel McAdams). He can't trust the relationship (she has bad friends, bad parents and bad values), so he goes to great lengths to sabotage it (obsessing about Paris, particularly Paris in the 1920s, to the point where he believes he can actually visit it. Can he really, or is he delusional? No one is really sure.).  There are charming things in this movie. Paris is charming. The conceit of meeting the great artists who ran in the same circles in Paris in the 1920s is charming. Some of the performances are charming. But unless you have never, ever seen a Woody Allen movie, or you've suffered one of those amnesia-inducing brain injuries common in movies, or you're such a Woody fanboy that you're willing to watch the same movie over and over again, there's no particular reason to see this one.
B0044DEAUA|1.0|I don't understand how all the other reviewers had such positive experiences with theirs. I am using an iPhone 4s and the sound is very staticky on both ends. I thought I had a defective unit, so I returned it, but the next unit is exactly the same.
B004EPZ03O|1.0|A poor follow-up to the Muppet legacy. Overly long songs by Segel that aren't funny. Not worth the time or money.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I'm not sure exactly what to say about this one save to say it is Stephen King with his love of the F word and what may be the silliest premise he has ever created.  I think King has resorted to simply ripping stories off his computer without reading them....  But this story has a certain silly appeal that kept me reading... after all one doesnt find a ___________________________  often.  And I wanted to know what ultimately happened... One day this will become a science fiction short movie that could be quite good.  At least it didn't eat the ... hm... better not reveal that for people who will read this book.  It is a fast read and actually entertaining... just don't expect great literature by any stretch of the imagination.  I have this image of King sitting at his computer saying to himself... this shouldn't take more than an hour to write.  I would buy it again but just be warned.  It is not in the least scary, the premise is silly, but it will waste an hour.  :)

1439102813|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book. It's not well-written and there are some really unrealistic parts of it. You're going to be alone in a normal house, with normally operated locks, with someone whose Alzheimer's is so severe that they've wandered into the street and almost been hit by a car? You're going to sit around next to the ocean with that person even though you might fall asleep and they could wander off or go for a swim and be unable to get back? That seems realistic...<br /><br />The characters are flat and the plotting and ending are really unfulfilling. The book just kind of ends at a random point. Everyone's emotions seemed accurate and reasonable but that's not enough to make a good book.<br /><br />I have a chronic pain condition that also affects the memory in some similar (though much more minor) ways, and which also caused people to treat me as though my personality had suddenly shifted. If I didn't have that personal understanding/connection I would never have finished the book. The writing alone, not to mention the unrealistic aspects, would have made me put it down.<br /><br />For example, at one point the author says \\"people with average IQs don't kill themselves.\\" What she means is that people don't kill themselves solely because their IQ is average, but even reading it with all the context I was a bit like, \\"Wait, what?\\" Sometimes I think editors have become softies who don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, or like people just aren't rigorously editing their books anymore. This author expects you to make assumptions. I'm sure in her head the husband has taken plenty of precautions, but if it's not on the page then it didn't happen. That's how books work (it's not like this is a thriller with a shadowy conspiracy theory that you're supposed to guess at).<br /><br />I think I would only recommend this to someone who knows an Alzheimer's patient, and even then it would be with a lot of warnings not to expect a gripping, brilliant book (which it could have been). I only give this two stars because I think it does accurately represent most of the emotions involved.two stars because I think it does accurately represent most of the emotions involved.

B000A2W1X2|5.0|I purchased this DVD after reviewing a few lists of historical romance movies posted on Amazon.  This is an excellent movie, with the right amount of sexual tension and love.

At load screen there were some links to advertise their others games but all I had to do was click to start my game. on the first level it sort of has a tutorial that walks you through to explain how everything works but its fast. It runs smoothly and has a neat comic book style story line between levels you can read if you wish. Only left 1 star off rating because the graphics could be slightly better. All in all I see myself wasting a good amount of hours that I should be sleeping playing this game.

0312641893|5.0|This book was awesome! Cinderella is one of my favorite tales, and Marissa Meyer has revamped it and upgraded it to a story that is just stunning. With Cinder's futuristic element, an epic romance, and the looming threat of war, it is a tale that you will not want to miss.<br /><br />The world was so cool. Though I was a bit confused at first - fully understanding the world and what was going on did take a bit, but once it did everything made perfect sense. The story also switches between being told from Kai and Cinder's lives, which is about my favorite thing an author can do.<br /><br />I loved all the characters in Cinder! Iko, Peony, Dr. Erland, Kai - they were all just great. I loved Cinder as a main character - she had a bit of spunk and wasn't afraid to stand up for herself. I am really curious to see how all the characters develop over the next books, as I just loved them all. Everything about Kai was great - I was always curious to see how he'd react in different situations.<br /><br />The plot was a lot of fun. I won't lie, I guessed how the book would end fairly close to the beginning. Since I was pretty sure how it would end, throughout the entirety of the book it was a lot of fun guessing if I was right or how this event would play out. I loved that Cinder was a mechanic - it was very different and made it that much more fun.<br /><br />This is a absolutely brilliant debut. I loved the elements of Cinderella entwined in the futuristic world and intense story line. Marissa Meyer is definitely an author to watch, and I cannot wait to see what it next for Cinder and Kai.

At first I wasn't sure about this book because it had a slow start, but it definitely picked up and I finished the last two parts of the book in a two days. If I had had more time in my day I would've finished it in one. If you haven't read this book you definitely need to, but read Hunger Games first so you know what's going on.

B006ON41FC|4.0|This app is well designed with only a few bugs. Device: HTC EVO Shift  Bug Report: Bug 1: Touch areas for steering are too specic, if you do not have your thumbs perfectly in the circle you will not turn. Bug 2: Game play can be jumpy and laggy at times especially as you first load the game.  Game Play: Relatively simple concept, fly through the air and collect nuts without hitting obstacles.  Simple left and right controls keep game play from overloading you as you navigate trees, birds, and explosives that are constantly in your way.  Goals/Advancement in game:  Every 3 achievements you accomplish you advance through different nut based ranks.  Earning nuts to add to your bank on top of those you collect as you progress through the game.  Store: In the game store you spend nuts to buy one time power-ups, permanent upgrades for the power-ups, and outfits to wear as you fly.  All of the objects are a bit overpriced in my opinion.  For a game where it is not uncommon to collect 150 nuts using a nut magnet that costs 400 it seems a bit unbalanced.  Overall: 4 out of 5 due to minor bugs and unbalanced game play.

030746363X|2.0|After reading the book and trying the accelerated fat loss techniques, I can honestly say that they ended up having the opposite affect on me.  The concept of excessive calorie cheat days must be undertaken with caution by those who are serious about it and have self discipline.  What I found was that I fought extreme sugar cravings for the entire week in between.  At first I was able to discipline myself to only cheating the one day per week then after a few weeks I noticed I was adding a cheat meal here and there.  I can't say the technique doesn't work if you do it right but I DO know as a health care professional that eating sugar leads to sugar cravings later. You gotta be able to \\"just say no.\\"  I also tried the cold water/ice baths.  Scientifically those do work.  I just don't think a 5-10 minute cold shower was enough to make a big difference for me. Unfortunately, I didn't have the \\"luxury\\" of soaking for 30 minutes in a ice bath.  The garlic/green tea xtract/alphalipoic acid/polycosanol supplements actually do work.  I still use those even though I have abandoned the other techniques (after gaining 20 pounds!) I have almost lost the weight I gained by following these techniques by plain ol' tried and true \\"calories burned must be greater than calories ingested\\" methods.  Along with the supplements above which seem to help mobilize subborn belly fat.  I can't speak to the other parts of the book.  I really didn't buy it for those topics.  Some of it was interesting reading though.
0553328255|1.0|Just bought a book by Bantam Books.  Probably the worst printed book I have ever purchased.  Printed words so close to the binding you can barely read them.  I will definitely stay away from Bantam Books in the future.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Awesomely useful calendar functions, which sync seamlessly with Google calendar. I have been experiencing one issue, though. It refuses to sync my task list! Under the tasks tab it even says \\"keelerjm's list\\" but it doesn't sync. Frequently when I boot the program up, I get the following error message: \\"Warning: an error occurred during the sync of your tasks. IO error: 403 forbidden\\" Is anyone else having this problem? I have checked every preference setting I can think of and have enabled syncing of my tasks, but seems like there is some kind of bug in the program. It would be perfect if not for this!
B0062NAX1U|4.0|This is a poignant film that is not too overeaching. It stays right on message. We are introduced to 4 fairly average Police Officers who are experiencing typical everyday problems - 1 is settling into a new job and has a teenage daughter who wants to hang with the wrong crowd. Another Officer, younger and single, has fathered a child with his now ex-girlfriend. One is trying to get a shed built.<br /><br />Typical stuff till one of them experiences a terrible family tragedy. In the aftermath he begins to question his own work ethic as a father. Eventually he goes on a quest to get more involved and do everything possible to be a proper role model for his children. He also encourages his buddies to do so as well. Once they enter into this challenge each of them will have to struggle and sometimes fall in order to become truly engaged as spiritually centered parents. This spirtually based film with no bankable A list stars received scant advertising by it's distributors. Still it is a powerful film, recommended viewing for all Fathers and the teenagers in their home.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This app works great. I don't know why some are complaining about ads. There's a button to start the game and a strip above showcasing other app by the developer. Big deal. Click the button to start and away you go. Some people are way too picky. There's no ads during game play. The auto zoom feature compensates well for the small tiles (another dumb complaint when using a 4&quot; screen.) I like it.<br />(I'm running on a G2x)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wanted to read the bible more but didn't know where to start.  The daily plans give me something to follow and I get reminded daily what I need to read.

B005I6EU48|5.0|Although I at first thought it was a little too expensive, now that I have it i say now that it was worth every penny. The material is durable, it looks great, and it has already protected my kindle on numerous occasions. In addition the cover makes it easy to prop  it up. I have also gotten many compliments on how it makes me kindle look.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|Moneyball was overall a great movie... A first Iwas worried that the two main charecter's personalities were going to clash, but they ended up actually being able to play off of each other extremly well. It tells a story about how the scouting system for baseball has come to be what is today and how much of a dramatic leap it was for back in that time period. I also shows an interesting angle on how hard it is to get people who are set in their ways to open up to new ideas and practices of up and comming generations. Therefore, I reccomend this movie to all movie lovers and fanatics!
0891419063|5.0|its a great book with great wording.. a Must have for anyone interested in Military History. Also, it is on the Commadant of the Marine Corps reading list.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|It completely locked up on my Xoom. The screen orientates upside down and the Player dialog is off the edge of the screen. I never  did get to play it.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|THIS WAS SUCH A HOT MOVIE, WHITNEY WAS SO CUTE IN THIS FILM, SO YOUNG, AND FULL OF ENERGY.... GOD BE WITH YOU WHITNEY
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just love this game. I have been searching for a decent version and have finally found one. The auto zoom is very nice. And the story line keeps u from getting bored! Very addicting!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I think this cover is perfect for mt kindle. It is exactly what the description says. Nice and lightweight. I have a different cover that is heavier and what I like about this one is that the screen is in no way obstructed by the cover.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|Voy a redactar mis impresiones de forma concisa...  1. Demasiado sexo gratuito e irrelevante para la historia.  2. Actuaciones debiles. Solamente Xena salva la debacle.  3. Efectos especiales no me terminaron de convencer, la sangre se ve poco real.  4. Historicamente, no tiene muchos aciertos y se desvia de la historia original.  5. El paquete esta bien presentado.  6. El guion lo pudo haber redactado mi hija de 5 anos. No hay sorpresas.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Lonesome Dove has been one of my all time favorite movies, although it really was a mini-series.  I kept it recorded on my standard def DVR but when I upgraded to HD I no longer had it.  I purchased this and watched part of it this weekend.  Wonderful.  Great resolution. Very happy with the DVD.
B00192IV9U|5.0|great cd i was not really sure about this one at first but after i got it i can listen to it everyday and still enjoy it.All his music is great but if you do not have this one you would be sorry not to add this one to your collection.

B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great for making all kinds of notes and lists. It could be easier to sync with other devices, but it's great other than that.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game.  The backdrops are beautiful.  I like to play relaxing games after a stressful day and this does the trick :)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|free app of the day and it was worth the download..  I like it so 5 stars from me and my fam.
B006UG90RM|5.0|To say this album is a pleasant surprise would be an understatement. And a big thank you goes out to whoever woke up that sleeping giant known as Eddie Van Halen. His playing on this album is really great. It's great to hear a classic rock album being put out in 2012. And the people b*tching about them using some of their old demo's need to get over it. They did indeed write them in the first place so it's up to them to use them as they please.  Way to go boys. You did yourself proud on this one!
0071762345|5.0|CORRECTION! The title of this book should be: \\"Likeable Social Media-How To Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistable Brand, and be Genarally Amazing on Facebook (and Twitter)\\". This offering lacks EXTENSIVE information on other vital social networks (in particular LinkedIn, the professional networking Goliath and 20% the size of Facebook) and whatever information is herin contained is exiled to the appendix. At times Mr. Kerpen is self-serving in promoting his clientele (1.800.Flowers is mentioned so many times I found myself having an allergic reaction to the pollen in the copy). NEVER ALLOW YOUR WIFE TO LEAVE A BOOK REVIEW ON AMAZON! (Anything less than ****** means couples therapy). Back cover: would have \\"liked\\" to see a few testimonials from Facebook users (for every company mention in this book there was a consumer one). The above mentioned pales in comparison to the stellar, THUMPS UP job done by Mr. Kerpen in educating me on the \\" 4 key concepts\\" of social media marketing: 1. Listen 2. Be transparent 3. Be responsive 4. Be \\"Likeable\\" (ok 5. Be authentic 6. Be honest.- having trouble with my character defects). I was enlightened by discovering the importance of word-of-mouth marketing, the personalization of the web and the overall social media revolution. As a highly successful \\"pre-internet\\" entrepreneur in the direct marketing space I found the chapter ending \\"action items\\" a valuable resource for R.O.I. fundamentals as well as the cowed sourcing case studies and the clever \\"do not delete rule\\". Fortunatly you don't have to be a math teacher to grasp how \\"Likeable Social Media......\\" can enrich your businesses (small and corporate) target audience with proper R&D efforts. This publication is a common sense, easy read instructional road map utilizing Facebook (and Twitter) strategy to connect with today's empowered, savy consumer and in doing so building brand strength. Like it or not it's the crunch-and-munch digital terrain we all live in and Mr. Kerpen is insightfull enough to link us to it. Well done.......
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great download. So glad it was free today. Love Amazons free app a day. Better than the average Mahjong. A must download.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game made me and my family have fun and smile hope you and family enjoy it two I did.
0399256385|5.0|At age 17 months, my son would rather chew books than read them, so I was surprised to see how much he loves his Spot book. He likes the simple, colorful drawings, and he enjoys lifting the flaps. In this book, Spot says goodbye to his friends, takes a bath, says goodnight to his parents, puts away his toys, and more. It's a perfect bedtime book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game had great graphics and is very fun to play. I love the game of Mahjong and this game does not disappoint.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very nice spin on a classic game.  good story line.  a great way to pass time.  I would check out more game from g5.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This Mahjong changes tilesets and graphics as each section is reached.  Colorful backgrounds and tiles.  Mahjong Artifacts combine the best of Mahjong. Very interesting!
0061969656|4.0|I enjoyed the book allot, I had moments where I was so entranced that I felt like I was there... then, it was lost. this was not Cornwall's doing though. I had lost the vision the book should place in me so many times due to my growing family. The otherwise spell binding book would get interrupted with a 16 month old screaming and a mortal battle of epic proportions between he and his 3 year old sister. Naught a moment to soon was I there to rescue them from each-other grips, when I'd hear the shout from my Queen \\"Where hast thou been Lord Richards? Sitting on your 'throne' whilst the fart fan do run?\\"  I replied swiftly but not cunningly enough \\"I had heard our children engaged in mortal combat and I ran as quickly as I could to save them from the others hands, it appears Sir Desmond was going to behead the beauty Barbie of Malibu, and Knight Winry came to her rescue, and the fight ensued, I did not have time to cleanse the foul off mine hands Lord Queen\\"  \\"What is tat in your hands?\\" she replied. \\"My king doth dream in the day as he reads his scrolls fantasy?\\", I knew i was done for, I had the scrolls on my very hands as she spoke with my thumb making the page I had left in my haste to save my children. She was right as she always is.  My reply was a simple sigh of acceptance that I was to blame for the conflict among my petulant offspring...  Yeah, fatherhood can really ruin your private reading time, this book would have been much more enjoyable if I was a single adult that could read it in a 1 or 2 day span and get totally immersed.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|it otherwise is a great adaptation of he game and the zoom option helps with the size issue. I like the adventure story aspect of it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|good game play, nice graphics
055358894X|3.0|So I picked up this book because I had seen it recommended on some \\"best of\\" lists, and the caper angle seemed fun.  I really enjoyed the first section of the book before the actual plot kicked off.  The main character in particular seemed well rounded if not completely novel, and the caper was entertaining with enough mystery to keep you hooked.  Certainly something different than the normal fantasy fare.  I read the first part very quickly, and if I had stopped there I would have given the book 4-5 stars.  Unfortunately, the main plot doesn't in my mind live up to the promise of the first part of the book.  <Minor Spoilers Ahead - I won't give away important plot points, but I will discuss the general direction of the book to express my issues.>  I was interested when the main plot line started up about 1/4 the way in to see where it would go.  At first, the mystery was intriguing.  However, as more and more of the main plot was revealed, the more disappointed I became.  Mainly, for a book that focuses on a \\"brilliant\\" protagonist, nothing really smart happens.  The hero doesn't really ever outsmart anyone in a notable way except one character to get a new set of clothes (one of the better sections of the later part of the book).  He essentially lucks out several times by not dying when he should, and the one time he does truly outsmart a villain, it is because that villain makes a foolish assumption that almost made me go \\"really?\\" out loud when I read it.  By the time I was finished I couldn't help but feel somewhat frustrated.  The book starts out as Oceans Eleven and basically ends as a Die Hard sequel.  Again, I thought that the author skillfully created an interesting world and colorful characters.  It is okay for a main character not always to be in control or to have all the answers, but the main character didn't need to be an amazing thief for the plot to unfold as it did.  If you want an interesting and unique fantasy world with a hard to predict direction, you may enjoy this book, but if you are looking for a well orchestrated caper where the main character outclasses his enemies and leaves you appreciative of the subtleties (as the first part of the book indicated) I can't recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|clean fun interface very well done nice ideas to add story to standard game play. thank-you so very much for a quality game.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|It was a cool idea to have Peter Parker's suit turn black from some foreign substance that alters the mind and makes one do weird, crazy, and unfriendly things. It just added to the plot and twisted it even more. Above all, it made Peter seem 'human', instead of the do no wrong image that he had in the first two movies. In this movie, there are several things going on at the same time: the avenging of Harry's father's death, the avenging of Peter's uncle's death through Spider-Man, a relationship between Peter and Mary Jane going sour, a competition between Peter and another Daily Bugle photographer, and an aunt who's teaching Peter that revenge is not the answer to any problem. In the end, the killer of Peter's uncle is remorseful, and Peter accepts him. Also, Harry is told that his father's death wasn't at the hands of Spider-Man, and ironically he dies the same way his father did, but not before forgiving Peter and assisting him to bring down the villains. As usual, the effects are superb, the action plentiful (easily the most action out of the three movies), and the emotion is heartfelt. This was an ambitious effort by the moviemakers, and those who love the franchise will really appreciate this one. I rank this movie 2nd out of the three.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game features solid game play and a nice twist on a classic game.  easily provides hours of entertainment.  i would purchase more games from this publisher.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have enjoyed this solitaire game, almost daily since downloading it last week. I almost feel like I am playing with a real deck instead of playing on a computer &quot;tablet.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|The item was not very sturdy upon receipt and in fact had a broken piece, so we had to return for a refund. They were unable to exchange it.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I ordered the Lightweight MicroShell Folio cover for my Kindle Fire at first.  When it came in, I was very dissappointed.  The front is just a piece of thick rubber.  I was afraid it would not protect my Kindle, so I went through the process of returning it and re-ordering the better leather case.  It was more expensive, but it is worth the extra money.  My Kindle is very well protected, and I feel better about carring it places.  My advice, spend the extra money and get the better leather case.
0446547654|2.0|I too am a Nicholas Sparks fan but the very trite ending to this book ruined it for me.  My sister underwent a lung transplant in the early 1990s.  Organs are not donated without the express permission of the family.  She made one ''dry run'' to the hospital after being told a lung was available only to learn the family had declined their permission.    This was so predictable and completely unfathomable.  The key character had no family, therefore there was no way his heart could just be put into the young man's chest.  Nicholas Sparks should have researched organ transplantation before writing such an ending.  He's done a great disservice to the many folks who are waiting for organs.  Katie Foley, Daytona Beach, FL
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Super fun throwback, if you are a Myst series and adventure/puzzle fan. Very short game, but worth the $2. Puzzles aren't overly hard, but still fun and rewarding.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|very engaging and fun app. it makes me want to keep playing. i like the story line and picture sequences that go along with this game.
B003Y5H4SO|1.0|This was so God-awful that I can't imagine anyone favorably reviewing it.  Ever.  Probably the worst film M. Night has made so far, besides The Happening.  Why does he make such crappy movies?  Won't someone stop him?  I'm not going into any kind of detail for why this sucks because I'd be here all day.  Sorry, don't have that kind of time.  I love great movies and this is the antithesis of those.  Awake!  Venger As'Nas Satanis  Ipsissimus  Cult of Cthulhu
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loveee dis game I am almost done with every board in 2 days I never beat a game like this in a long time.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I bought this game a week ago and have not stopped playing yet. I love this game. but I keep hitting those darn ice things.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|There are two kinds of Rolling Stones fans.  The first kind was alive and rocking when the band delivered the one-two gut punch of [[ASIN:B001WCN23W Sticky Fingers]] and [[ASIN:B0039TD7RC Exile on Main Street]] (1971 and 1972, respectively). The Beatles had called it a day...no more yearly \\"events\\" like [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered)]] and [[ASIN:B0025KVLUQ Abbey Road (Remastered)]]. If the Stones were in fact \\"the greatest rock & roll band in the world,\\" as is proclaimed on the opening of [[ASIN:B00006AW2K Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!]], the playing field was a lot less crowded in 71-72. Their major competition came in the form of The Who ([[ASIN:B00008LOS1 Who's Next (Deluxe Edition)]] in 1971 and [[ASIN:B005DMNS4A Quadrophenia]] in 1973). But in terms of straight-ahead, Chuck Berry-style, riff-driven, testosterone-driven rock and roll, The Stones WERE the greatest, especially during Mick Taylor's tenure. In order to be the \\"first kind of\\" Stones fan, you had to be there as it unfolded. You had to walk into your local \\"record Store\\" and peel the cellophane off of your copy of \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile\\" and place it on your turntable and lower the tonearm and hear the crackle of needle hitting vinyl and hear the opening \\"fire in the hole\\" blasts of \\"Sticky Fingers\\" or \\"Rocks Off\\" for the FIRST time. I was / am \\"that kind of Stones fan\\"...I was there.  The second kind heard the music later, perhapes decades later, and may have discovered it through the many bands who were formed and influenced by being \\"the first kind of\\" Stones fan. You've probably heard Roger (The Byrds) McGuinn's anecdote about seeing The Beatles' [[ASIN:B004U7MQXS A Hard Day's Night]] and immediately deciding that he needed to form a band. He wasn't alone. There were many, back in the day, who heard Mick Taylor and Keith Richards send out salvo after salvo of deadly blues and R&B flavored licks while Jagger prowled the stage and Watts and Wyman soldiered on, expressionless, and thought \\"THIS is my sandbox. THIS is where I need to be playing.\\"  This DVD, despite any technical imperfections of the era, captures the Sones when they were at their undeniable peak. In the accompanying booklet, Jagger mentions the fact that the Stones could have off nights and be sloppy:  \\"It's a full-on performance and energy levels are really high...Everyone's very together and on, you know. I can remember the Rolling Stones being, sometimes, very lackadaisical. a very sloppy band on stage, at this period. But that was obviously not the case on this day.\\"  This was the Exile On Main Street tour. Just as Ron Wood was essentially a \\"guest\\" on [[ASIN:B001WCN23M Black and Blue]] and went full throttle on [[ASIN:B005N95JA4 Some Girls: Deluxe Edition]], Taylor did the same on \\"Sticky Fingers.\\"  It's a sheer joy watching Jagger do his best rooster strut as Keef rips into \\"Happy\\" like a pit bull tearing into a pork chop. Jagger takes his time with the \\"tease\\" section of \\"Midnight Rambler\\" (\\"Oh NO, baby...you can't DO that, baby...), before blood-red stage lights bathe him in his white jumpsuit howling \\"Waaaal, you HEARD about the BAW-stunnn...\\" Taylor and Richards lock horns behind him, spewing out raw, sustained blues licks while Wyman and Watts hold the bottom firm and the entire band erupts in lock-step precision.  THIS is rock and roll. The hype about the Rolling Stones? There IS no hype, just the music. The same as the Beatles. It wasn't great because your mom and dad liked it. It was great because it was great, and it still is. For decades later, this music on this DVD will show you no mercy.  A true gem if there ever was one.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love the graphics and the sound and animations are great! the ads aren't that bad at all, its just 1 screen.. no need to get your undies in a twist and leave a 1 star rating.
0439023491|5.0|The second book in Suzanne Collins' series the Hunger Games, Catching Fire, is now probably my favorite book of all time. Not only is it one of the few sequels that actually adds to the first book but I felt I could really relate to the themes of the book. I easily suspended disbelief and felt for the characters plight while at the same time seeing the connections to everything wrong and corrupt in our own world today. I'm so glad I bought MockingJay at the same time because I wouldn't have been able to wait the shipping time to read it!
B006SV2LWA|4.0|This is the Steven Soderbergh flick that at first looked like a redo of Outbreak, but it has none of average movie polish.  There's no villain withholding a cure or starting the disease, no lone gunman to single-handedly find the cure and fly in the face of officialdom while doing it, and no damsel who accidentally infected herself to put a face on the virus for the hero to race to cure.  Instead, this movie shows the effects of the virus at all aspects.  The husband who loses his wife and stepson in the same day, who increasingly becomes more of a hermit to protect his daughter, the internet blogger who `exposes truth', but in reality may be looking out more for himself, the lab workers who struggle to pin down the virus, the CDC doctor on the ground backtracking the virus in the first few American cities, the WHO doctor who backtracks the virus through European and Asian countries who finds out exactly how desperate some are for a cure.  All these things combine in a way that gives a macro view of the virus and how more than death results from its presence.  Excellent performances from a tremendous ensemble cast.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great twist on a classic that keeps it interesting. Any Mahjong fan will love this. Quality is high, runs smooth and looks great on a tablet. 5 stars from me and this is the first time I have felt compelled to rate any app ever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game.i rate it a 5 and when it came to the uptate it was fine but some people say it didn't work. THEIR LYING completely lying and if u ask them they will denie it
B004SIP9VA|5.0|This movie is about a  man named John Clark (Richard Gere) who is a Chicago lawyer.  John  is a workaholic who needed to do something different than the old run of the mill.  He sees a dance studio on the way home from work..  On the way home from work one evening John sees Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) inside the window looking at him.  Paulina makes John want to take dance lessons.  John does not tell her wife Beverley (Susan Sarandon) or his daughter Jenna (Tamera Hope) that he is taking dance lessons.  John really looks forward to dance class every Wednesday night.  He makes some really good friends. Watch the movie if you have not already to see what happens to John and the rest of the characters.. I love watching this movie with my parents..  I hope you enjoy the movie!
B001E9641K|5.0|It's pretty, and I mean that in the best sense. We are fans of Ticket to Ride Europe in this household. So we thought we'd give Nordic as a Christmas gift to one of our game-playing adult kids. As an art-lover,  I appreciated the snowy changes in the card illustrations, as well as the wintry feel of the game board ~ so appropriate for playing by the fire while it's cold outside!  For those familiar with Ticket to Ride rules, the fun exception in this one is that you can take a  wild \\"rainbow\\" train car card plus another.  In the traditional game, you can only take one...and if you realise you missed one, usually an audible groan is heard.  So it feels quite lavish to be able to keep the wild card and pick a second.  With only 2 or 3 players, it's a cozier game.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|Take Shelter- Michael Shannon is awesome.  He's a slow boiler in this movie just like Ben Kingsley was in House of Sand and Fog.  He plays a man in  the Midwest somewhere (Kentucky-ish, Ohio-like) who begins having visions of an oncoming, terrible storm.  He's desperate to protect his family after 4 nights of eerie nightmares and begins repairing a storm shelter.  He and his wife have a deaf daughter, but his insurance will cover a cochlear implant that will give her hearing.  But as things ratchet up and Shannon questions his own sanity, there's no guarantees of anything at all.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Excellent game and graphics! Highly recommended.  Played in LG Optimistic V flawlessly.  Even if not free worth it. Try it and leave feedback.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Alternating between sweet, moving and hysterical this movie is a winner! The layering is great - it's totally kid friendly with plenty of more subtle jokes mixed in to keep older viewers entertained. The pacing is perfect and the animation impressive. I highly recommend this for all ages.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The game has a story line to it as you solve various puzzles.  It its a game that allows you to pass time effortlessly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. I play it every day. Nice, smooth movement. Others are complaining about the ads but they honestly don't bother me at all.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I thought this was superior to its 1980s predecessor.  Charlie Brewster is given more depth and characters are given motivations for their actions.  Women play a more important role in this story as Charlie's girlfriend doesn't find out the danger in the final 3rd of the movie and immediately become a victim and Charlie's mother actually gets involved in the story.  Colin Farrell portrays Jerry as just as much animal as human and there's even a surprise cameo by Chris Sarandon.  I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|I rarely find the time to actually write reviews, but Drive contained such poor character development, needless violence, lack of plot and lack of actual driving that, in the interest of sparing hours from other people's lives, I hope that someone can derive value from this review and avoid watching this film.  This was perhaps the most poor film I have ever seen, as agreed upon by the three other people watching it with me.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|Thus endeth one of the most popular - and profitable - series in movie history.  And the good news is that it ends more with a bang than with a whimper.  For once we push through the clutter of wand-waving, spell-casting and jaw-dropping CGI effects that have been the hallmark of the works, we're left with a moving, deeply human tale of an honorable man (Daniel Radcliffe) putting his life on the line for those he loves.<br /><br />The movie finally reaches the climax that the series has been leading to all along: the fight-to-the-death battle between Harry and his arch nemesis, Voldemort, the man who killed his parents.  The one criticism one might have with this scenario is that it essentially reduces most of the other characters - including the lovable Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson) - to mere onlookers of the action.<br /><br />As directed by David Yates, \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Harrows - Part 2\\" has drama and action to spare, but it's the human element  - along with an epilogue that hits all the right notes - that brings the beloved series to such a satisfying conclusion.

B004EPZ0AC|3.0|This movie... is terrible. That's the truth, from an adults' point of view. The animation, though beautiful and wonderful and nearly better than the first, is still not enough to cover up the fact that this movie makes very little sense. There were too many plot point, none of which really made more than a few steps before they fell flat on their faces. We all know that it's bad and stupid and blah blah blah.  BUT, it's a movie for kids. Kids who like fun penguins making stupid jokes and dancing and singing. And every kids I saw in the the theater when I saw this movie.. well, they were laughing and jumping up excitedly and dancing along with those stupid, plotless penguins.  So yes, it's a movie with poor plot, no direction, and, obviously, it was only made because they wanted more money. It's not a bad movie though. It's fun, it's bright, it's silly, and there are a least a few nice themes (such as the \\"every little step counts\\" thing). Stop looking at it the way an intelligent adult would and just.. shut up, and watch the dancing penguins.  I loved this movie. I really did, and I would recommend it to anyone with an open-mind and kids who like movies with animals or silly dancing or what have you. Everyone can enjoy this movie, if try.

0374275637|4.0|I find very exciting that Mr Kahneman presents an endless array of experiments where participating subjects reveal astonishing  decision making and behaviour.Some things are known from experience, never the less it is different to understand the origin of human decisions/behaviours.  Since the whole book contains a lot of information on pitfalls to avoid while we  judge the others and ourselves, as well as situations, I feel it would be interesting to include in the future an Appendix with a number of \\"rules\\" that one could review fast and frequently, in order to become more effective in thinking fast and slow.

0517548232|5.0|I purchased the 1979 edition of Hazlitt's book as a MBA candidate at Pepperdine University.  My professor, the erudite and sharp minded Dr. George Reisman, wanted to instill in his students the fundamental principle of liberty and how government attempted to disrupt and eradicate that liberty at every opportunity.  Intervention was its means and totalitarianism was its method.  Hazlitt is no exception when it comes to upholding liberty.  His book attests to the vitality of his work. The book's rankings on Amazon demonstrates how oppressed people seek for answers to fend off the oppressors and their interventionists policies through a corrupt government. He begins the work at the place Ken Starr did in a lecture I attended in which he reviewed his prosecutorial experience with former President Clinton: the broken window. There are striking parallels between the economic principle and the moral principle that Starr applied.  Both involved the impact of vandelism in a corrupt society.  The two vandels existed in separate segments of society, but the net effect was the same: the destruction of long term value that may not be visible to the naked eye.  One was theft of private property through its destruction (the broken window) and the other the theft of societal morals through political corruption.  One might ask, \\"How in the world can you make this parallel?\\"  Easy.  Hazlitt argues from the fallacy of destruction.  When destruction occurs in any area of society, whether in economics or politics, part of society gets destroyed.  He argues that economists who argue for the destructiveness of war see it as a good thing when the opposite is true.  When destruction occurs, it wipes out capital, and when that happens, wealth declines.  The same is true in Clinton's case, except the capital of a moral society declined (and it continues to do so thanks to an immoral president).  Adam Smith makes it clear that economics and morality work hand in hand.  Hazlitt confirms this.The other part of destruction is when the government intervenes through heavy taxation and regulation.  It performs a similar theft of capital by converting capital into consumption (i.e., public works projects) and stifles the growth of capital, productivity, and the economy.  Hazlitt wrote his first edition just after the destructive reign of Roosevelt who presided over the greatest destructive measures in US history with his heavy taxation, tarriffs, deficit spending, and regulations.  We saw the longest capital destroying Depression in modern history followed by one of the most destructive wars this nations every experienced that sucked capital out of the economy to feed the war through deficit financing.  Hazlitt covers both of these types of destruction to the economy successfully.  While it appears that war creates capital, this is deceitful.  All war does is shift capital from other industries toward the industries that support the war.  A further aggrevation of the economy was rationing.  With the shifting of capital toward consumption and destruction, rationing of scarce supplies occurred, and guess who was in charge of it?  That's right!  The government.  The result of rationing industries from where capital got shifted to support war industries had their capital stolen, thereby leading to rationing of what was left over in those industries.  As these war industries absorbed capital for producing war equipment that gets destroyed, there is insufficient capital reinvested.  Conseqently, the entire economy suffered.  Then Hazlitt gets into a topic that burns hot today - picking winners and losers among industries and companies.  Hazlitt observed the same problem then as exists now with the Obama administration: proping up industries (banks, auto, etc.) at the expense of taxpayers (both individuals and companies).  The results is corporate cronyism and corruption.  This is how economics and morality get married.  In essense, Obama is no different from Clinton in destroying the moral fiber of our nation through the reallocation of wealth and its destruction while he does it.  Hazlitt saw that almost 80 years ago and warned us about it.  Those who argue against Hazlitt and his economics are really short-sighted in not being able to see all sides of the economic picture.  They miss the point of the very simple but powerful illustration Hazlitt provides at the beginning about the broken window.  They see only the consumption side (the loss and new replacement that makes it appear that nothing happened) and not the capital side (the siphoning off of capital through destruction so that eventual capital is lost).  Hazlitt points out this ignorance, which makes his message long lasting and popular.  Free people do not like to be controlled whether by government, unions (which Hazlitt also addresses), or vandels.  All three of these entities not only destroy or reduce capital but also the moral principles behind the creation of capital.  They produce nothing because that is not their purpose.  Their purpose is destruction and control, the opposite of liberty, moral sentiments (Adam Smith), and productivity that leads to a vibrant economy.
B001BPQT8A|1.0|Like so many other's have reported here, my disc would not play either! I have a Panasonic DMP-BD60K Blu-Ray Player with updated firmware. Never had any other disc do this. Just totally not readable.<br /><br />I often times buy a movie like this when it hits a great price, but then I don't watch it until sometimes a couple of months or so after buying. So I am past Amazon's  \\"return window\\" and am now only due for a partial refund - and I must pay shipping for the return. It will be cheaper for me to buy another copy of this movie, but not the blu ray book release.<br /><br />Anyway, I am rating this product, not the movie itself. The movie itself is awesome! And I love the pages in the blu ray book. Very kewl collectible stuff here. I just need a playable blu ray disc to put in the kewl case. Soon.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I did buy the single disc blu-ray (here at Amazon) in \\"Used - Like New\\" condition - worked perfectly, so I tossed out the non-working disc that came with the blu-ray book and popped in the working disc. Cost me a bit more than I had hoped for the overall purchase, but this movie is still super awesome. I just can't raise the rating I gave this blu-ray book. I am surprised it isn't removed by Amazon yet.

B006MW3VGA|5.0|This is my first Masterpiece Classic experience and I've become utterly enthralled.  It was only 3 days ago that I even heard of Downton Abbey, when a friend told me of the series and how much she loved it.  I began watching on the Amazon Instant  Video the same day and caught up in time to watch the last episode of season 2 on PBS tonight.  Not usually a fan of period drama, I have thoroughly enjoyed this series.  It's been a fascinating study of the British upper elite class and the service staff who work in the centuries-old Abbey and in particular, how the lives of these are intertwined.  I'm now a fan, just as season 2 comes to a close and will have to wait for the next season to find out if Matthew and Mary are destined to be together.  Sigh.

1607053551|5.0|I had one reason to want this book: I wanted to know how you design a repeating pattern. Not knowing was very perplexing for me. As far as I could tell, the only way I could design a repeating pattern would be to wrap a piece of paper around a tube and draw on it. That sounded borderline ridiculous so I needed this book.  Kim's book satisfied my curiosity, (no tubes!) but it did so much more as well.  First of all, a week after I read it I ended up designing my first fabric. Coincidence? Absolutely not. This book gave me the lift I needed to go from a good idea to an actual design. It helped me understand some important concepts that I could apply to the tools I had available. In my case, an iPad with a simple illustration program, but whatever your supplies are, even if they are just pencil and paper, there are instructions for you too. Do you want to do screen printing or block printing? Do you want to design with Photoshop or Illustrator for digital printing? All the steps are explained for whichever way you'd like to design.  The book also prepared me for dealing with color variation between my computer screen and online printers. Information on printing processes, types of fabric, and color theory are in there as well. There is a lot in the book I didn't expect. Some of it may not be useful to me right now (for instance, things to consider if licensing your designs) but I have to say I'm impressed at how thorough the book is. I can see that whether I just want to create an occasional fabric design, or if I get bitten by the bug and decide to pursue it as a serious venture, I will refer to A Field Guide to Fabric Design over and over in the coming years.

0865479186|2.0|Upfront, I am a sucker for books with this sort of title and content. Just get me started on the errors in thinking that abound, and I can go for as long as the refreshments and good company hold out.<br /><br />So maybe it was a case of me not liking my own medicine.<br /><br />What is good about the book? He shows that in matters of science:<br />1) Things are probably more complicated than the media makes it<br />2) You have to be skeptical of any scientific report - whether it is from a university, a pharma company, a acupuncturist, or even your mother<br />3) Be very careful about any statistical statements<br />4) A lot of sham medicine has been and is being perpetrated<br /><br />That's about it. And it is very good to have someone take the time to present arguments and examples from the real world to back up those warnings.<br /><br />What I found unsatisfying about the book? His tone. He doth protest too much, repeatedly telling us that he does not have axes to grind, or that he is level-headed, objective, and only strictly presenting the truth. The number of times he bashes Homeopathy and all the idiots who follow it made me want to go out and get a Homeopathy treatment and get better, just to spite him. I did plenty of page flips through sections where he was on a tear, looking for when the vitriol cooled and he would get back to some facts.<br /><br />He says outright that before 1934 doctors were useless. Wow. For a book that warns against making claims without empirical substantiation, that is a pretty strong statement. He lumps all other forms of medicine, throughout all time, into the useless bucket. And all humanity who has practiced or received medicine before 1934 in the West into the idiot bucket. So I kept waiting for him to balance his rants with the facts about his implicitly superior profession of conventional medicine. He holds up the fact that doctors recently proved that smoking causes most lung cancer (and makes no mention of why this only started happening after WWII.) He implies that antibiotics have saved many lives.<br /><br />He bravely admits that only 15% of existing conventional medical treatments are based upon statistical evidence that show benefit. Another wow. So what is it exactly that is so superior about our evidence based medicine compared to mumbo-jumbo, voodoo (quoting here) quacks if 85% of our treatments are based upon...nothing?<br /><br />I do appreciate his attempt to stay focused on the topic of critical thinking, and evidence-based claims. But there is a big gap in the exposition that would justify his self-proclaimed superiority.<br /><br />--Michael Claragesaved many lives.

B006ON41FC|3.0|I was playing for a while before open feint kicked in and really enjoying this game. I like the goals and the leveling up to different nuts. Then i started the game back up after a while and it said i was connected to open feint. It wouldn't have ben such a big deal but it had to scroll through all the achievement progress after every game and it was annoying. I read how to remove it, but when I tried I got an error message. Tried again and it said it worked but when the game loaded again it started open feint. The game froze and that's what it does every time now. I'm dsappointed because i really liked the game. I'll be paying more attention next time instead of geting started playing a game that forces open feint.

There are also some very eerie scenes that will command your full attention.  The problem with this movie is the ending. It leaves you wanting more finality and clarity, you're not sure where you are in the end. However, this is a good movie despite the drawbacks and all said this is probably one of the most unique movies you'll see for awhile.

B004LWZW7E|4.0|the movie was far from perfectly executed, some parts cheesy, highly coincidental. setting and location felt pretty narrow, just one city and didn't really inspire a broad concept of the future.  timberlake's and fanning's acting are also up for interpretation, but i'd rate them favorably.  the transfer of time concept wrist to wrist was also easy to lampoon.  however, i felt the overall idea was very fascinating, the genetically programmed people that stop aging at 25 and use time as their currency.  there can be numerous relationships drawn to our current economy, the freedom of labor, wage slaves, class, etc.  it raises the issue of \\"what is money\\", and in many ways, it is really just the commodization of our time.  there was some interesting slang/lingo regarding time, viewing one's life as only time, existing day to day, etc.  could have been much better, but better than 90% of things out there

0307352145|4.0|\\"Shut Up!\\" has become a mall moll's colloquialism to express disbelief.  The watchword cautions a noisy crowd into meditative reception.  It is a catchphrase that lessens the loud babbler and empowers the silent observer.  In other words, as the book's title suggests, we should stop our palaver and ponder the quiet person.  Susan Cain executes a fine defense of moderate people in a frenetic world.  A former Wall Street attorney, she has presented an academic product as is evidenced by approximately 47 pages of endnotes as well as her 16-page introduction.  Citing clinical studies, expert opinions, and professional comments, she traces the history of her subject from individual chivalry and personal character to our current culture of marketable personality.  Her exemplars and case studies substantiate the biological differences as well as some cultural nuances surrounding our understanding of extroverts and introverts.  And yet, no person is completely outgoing or entirely introspective.  There is balance, and we may have elements of both behavioral traits.  Cain's compilation of material and weight of argument guides us to nod in agreement that we live in a society that is fixated on outgoing stylists rather than the ponderous sustainers.  We live in a world of yin-and-yang; there is no extrovert without an introvert present.  Her elucidation might prompt a private understanding of our personality makeup.  A final chapter offers suggestions to parents and teachers about cultivating the introverted child.  But Cain's creation is more a textbook than a self-help guide.  Although her style is readable, it tends to be treatise-like and rather dry, lacking the hype, glibness, or glossy banter of a self-help guru akin to John Gray's \\"Men are from Mars...\\" franchise.  While comprehending this book you might experience some self-awareness--an \\"aha\\" moment--that cries out: \\"I'm not an introvert; I'm merely highly sensitive.\\"  But you'll not discover that epiphany unless youhush up and read this book.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|First things first - this album is different. From even the coverart, you can tell that Il Divo have this time gone for lighter shades in how they present themselves and how they sing, without having that overt darkness to their appearance and music. Which means, if you are expecting another song like 'Adagio' from the previous album, you'll be disappointed. Only a very small bit of this album goes up into the high drama stakes that the likes of Adagio from the last album set themselves up for.  The title track is clearly the standout... rather than take an already powerfully sung song like they have before, they've turned a once soft song into a huge burst of sound. In other words - they've completely re-interpretted it. And on this song you'll realise that the harmonies this time around have improved, by mixing voices differently. Different voices paired up at the right time is what really carries this song, and with that, the whole record.  IN A NUTSHELL - the harmonies are more varied on Wicked Game and LESS PREDICTABLE as they have been on the previous albums. While the song choices on 'The Promise' were a bit of a stinker, 'Siempre' had the least interesting harmonies down on the table for the men of Il Divo to sing.  Crying/Llorando: very poignant and breathtaking. I don't like the slight echo effect they've added to the start of the song, it highlights the range of each of them well. It also has Carlos singing very beautifully VERY SOFTLY for a change, which I personally love to hear.  Don't Cry For Me Argentina: yet again, Carlos brings out the best of his baritone voice, without just trying to sound like/complete with the tenors. This song really shows off how well Seb's voice has matured and grown.  Dove' L'Amore: adaption of Samuel Barber's Adagio. This shows off Seb's new-found power in his voice, as well as how well Urs can roll his words around in his mouth. The problem with this song is more than half of the song is sung at full-pelt. It becomes a bit too full on for me.  Falling Slowly/Te Prometo: An absolutely beautiful song. I often complain that the likes of Bocelli and othe crossover artists like Blake and The Canadian Tenors put just as much effort into the compositions of the music as they do with their singing, whereas Il Divo usually do not. This song HAS THAT BEAUTIFUL MUSIC that you probably crave if you are like me... the soft strings go very well with all of their voices in this song. It's one of the only true ballads of the album. It ends very suddenly, but yet again, i think Il DIvo is doing that just to surprise us in case we were expecting 'just the same as usual.'  Come What May/Te Amare: this song mirrors the classics of Il Divo. It's like the 'My Way' of this album, with a whole bunch of high-C's added to the end to showcase what David is really capable of. It has a surprisingly long intro, but the music is exquisite.  Senza Parole: Very, very dramatic song. It's only one of two originals on the CD, and is in Italian. Again the quality of the music has been stepped up a huge notch - you would not have heard such well composed music on anything since their first album so far. There is actually a male choir singing behind them in the first and last choruses for added dramatic effect.  Stay/Ven A Mi: In a bit of a twist, the music played at the very start of this song is keyboard. Yet again, they are goimg for something different so you're not listening to something that sounds like a song you've heard before. It's very pretty and it's magic comes from being very uncomplicated, which is probably why it reminds me a lot of their original song 'Rejoice' from the Christmas album.  Sempre Sempre: Their other original song, also in Italian. It's also very dramatic (they probably sound too much alike, unfortunately) however this has a very satisfying \\"boom boom boom boom!\\" on the drums at the end of the song.  Time To Say Goodbye: Carlos singing the start of this song reminds me of why I prefer to hear baritone versions of traditionally tenor songs, because there is a bit more warmth to the sound, so it sounds better than most versions to me. Urs reminds us that he is still the best at Italian on the second verse, and David gets his chance to hit those G's he loves so much on the first chorus. Great way to end a great album, however this song is dominated a bit too much by Carlos.  The only negative thing here is that yet again, they have released an album starved of original songs, and the original songs that they have put on this album won't stand the test of time like the originals of past albums.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|the comics make the game seem like you are part of the game. you are actually the character being awesome. not just running around like a random player. a really creative way to play mahjong!!

B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is actually the 4th time I've used this stuff. The first 2 times were for a pair of STK392-560 convergence IC's for a Sony rear projection TV. They keep the chips about 5C cooler than with the other thermal compound (measured with an infrared thermometer). Third use was for making a portable N64. Used it on the CPU, GPU, and RAM chips and they stay nice and cool. And my most recent use was for my computer CPU. This, along side the Cooler Master 92 Hyper TX3, keep my CPU A LOT cooler than the original equipment. If you are doing anything that requires thermal compound, then always get this stuff. Don't even bother looking at anything else, because EVERYTHING else is inferior to this.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|This game is fantabulous (that's a technical term).  I got it on Jan. 20, 2012 from my brother as a gift, and it has taken me a month of around an hour every few days to be able to go from start to finish in one sitting, which I just did a few minutes ago.  My brother's kids have the two easier versions and he doesn't own this one, but figured it would be a good thing for me, and he was right.  For those who don't know, the Perplexus Epic is a clear, hard plastic sphere about 8 inches in diameter, inside of which is a small steel ball (ball bearing size) and a maze of tracks.  There are 125 components to the track and the idea is to navigate the ball from the starting platform (1) to the ending \\"bucket\\" (125).  In a month of usage, I haven't had any issues with the quality.  I haven't dropped it, and am otherwise careful not to hurl it across the room in frustration (what I'm saying is that this game is probably not for those prone to physical violence).  The inside of my sphere has no loose pieces and there are no obstructions to the track (evidently has been an issue with some earlier versions).  This is definitely a nifty piece of game engineering.  Most of the track components are clearly numbered.  The track is hugely varied and some parts are trivial (such as a track with side walls) while others take different types of dexterity.  With some I make delicate movements (59, 98), others want the ball to have or acquire momentum (44->45, 77->78), with some I make quick movements (3, 99, 123), and with some I hop the ball (eg. on stairs), and a there are a few aerials.  With some, the trick is to figure out what the trick is - there were a few sections of track where it took me a LONG time to figure out a trivial way to do it because it looked like the track was asking for the impossible (eg. 20->21, 43->44->45, 64->65, 90->91, 111->112).  For some of the other ones, what was impossible at the beginning is now easy since I've become used to it.  One reviewer said that many of the steps are a matter of luck, but I think that most of them are a matter of skill once you've figured out the technique.  There are a few, though (49->50, 77->78, 79->80, 123->124) that I still find dicey and am sure I'm doing poorly.  While many of the track components are very easy, from personal experience I can say it is possible to jump the ball out of the track on almost all of them.  I like the fact that you can enter the ball onto the track at components 33, 56, and 91.  In addition, by jumping the ball it's possible to take shortcuts to a few areas of practise.  For example, jumping the ball from 92 to 122 would allow one to practice either 123 or (after a drop ontp 77) 77->78.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is the best mahjong game I have played. There are of options and the game play is really smooth. I highly recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is an amazing game!!! Everyone should get it!!! I love mahjong, and will play this app everyday!!! It's a game for all ages...young and old.

B000PKG6TE|5.0|I know there's a heavy leaning towards the early albums, which are also excellent.  I also know that I'm supposed to love Songs for the Deaf and Lullabies to Paralyze, but those are my two least favorite.  I just love the eccentricity of this album.  The guitar sounds hit a sweet spot with me on this album.  Weird tuning, weird chords, and weird effects, and yet they're still extremely catchy.  This album leans the most towards electronic out of any QotSA album and I love rock with electronic elements like Radiohead.  The drums are heavily processed electronic-style and I really enjoy that.  Homme's vocals here are also just out of this world.  Particularly the style of I'm Designer where he sounds kind like a bored posh British WASP.  Not to mention the lyrics which are phenomenal dancing on the line of humor and seriousness which only adds to the tone the song goes for.  A facetious message on selling out, honest, self-deprecating, and fun.  The simple vocal moments like the \\"HEUGH\\" sound in Sick, Sick, Sick, the harmony in Make It Wit Chu, it's all amazing to me.  The album does take a swerve with Battery Acid, probably my least favorite track, and tapers off towards the end with River In the Road, my 2nd least favorite.  Run Pig Run is a good song but not a song that I feel goes well with the rest of the album and can grow old quickly, the kind you might be inclined to skip because it just doesn't work with repeated listens the way the first three tracks do.  It's a good thing it's the last track, as if you're worn out on it you can just cut the album there.  With that said, I feel that the other tracks are so strong that the album still deserves five stars.  I don't believe in perfection, but I do believe there are things that resonate with you so well that you take the flaws with the goods and love the whole thing for them.  Era Vulgaris successfully has this effect.  It's like having an awesome sexy partner who annoys you sometimes, but hell, you still love it more than anything.  Era Vulgaris is not going to work for some people because of the difference in style to previous albums, the eccentricity of the sounds, the more electronic style, and the few weaker tracks.  For those it does work for though, it's going to work wonders.

0545265355|5.0|If you are thinking about reading the series buy all three at once! For one this set is a GREAT deal. For books that are usually $17.99 a piece getting all three from this is saving you $8 bucks a book! They say that it will take a while to get them because of the back order but I received mine on the 20th, 9 days after ordering and 11 days before they said I would get it. Now these books are just, well WOW! I couldn't put them down! You will stay up late reading these three amazingly written books! So happy with this purchase! Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing such an amazing story! These books will emotionally drain you and pull you in many different directions and break your heart on MANY various occasions, but in a good way! It is a great book for teens but also for any adult! Many of my friends mothers are in the process of reading the series! It is really amazing and if you are doubting getting it, DON'T! It is worth all $31!! Collins is a great writer and leaves cliff hangers at every end of a section, chapter, or book! You will undoubtedly be hooked on this series and may the odds be ever in your favor!!

0062119044|3.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is a fictional story of a mother who is desperate to figure out why her 15 year old son would carry out his plan to murder in cold blood seven classmates, an English teacher, and a cafeteria worker while on school grounds.  Evoking memories of Erik Harris and Dyland Klebold, Kip Kinkel, and other youth who bring bloodshed to school, this book tries to show the life of how one teenager may make this fatal decision and perhaps the signs that should have been seen leading up to it.  I'm not sure if the author was trying to point out that there are always signs, but often parents don't want to see them.  It definitely felt that this was what she was trying to do with the child in this story, Kevin Khatchadourian.  It also helped to illustrate what happens to the family that is left to deal with the aftermath.  The story is told in letters that the mother, Eva Khatchadourian, writes to her husband who is no longer in the picture.  It isn't clear until the end why he is not there.  Did he blame her for what happened?  The book is written for the general reader who is interested in trying to understand what makes schoolyard killers to, first, desire to kill, and second, to actually follow through on it.  Were their signs that should have been seen while the child was young that the parents missed?  Were they born this way?  Nature v. Nurture is definitely a running theme.  To be honest, I found the first half of the book tiresome to get through and also stopped reading.  It seemed like it was mostly about a \\"woe is me\\" mother and how life has been unfair about her.  I wasn't interested in how unfortunate she felt in how her life turned out, but how her son came to be who he was.  Luckily, the story picks up about half-way and becomes less about the mother and more about Kevin and also about Kevin's father and sister.  The second half was hard to put down and I was glad that I didn't give up on the book.  \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is a bookwhose subject matter is apt to get most people's attention.  We all desire to get into the minds of people who do acts that are so unthinkable so that we can understand why they did what they did.  Could they have been stopped?  Were they just misunderstood?  We never really find out in this book since it is told from the viewpoint of the mother.  Seeing how she had to deal with the consequences was definitely interesting.  She struggles to figure out what could have been done differently and will probably never find an answer to that.  As a reader, I would love to see a companion book that tells this story from Kevin's point of view.  Overall this was an interesting read and the second half of the book really picks up, whereas I felt the first half was hard to get through.  I am glad that I stuck with it because it did come to the point where I wasn't able to put down the book until its conclusion.

0439023513|2.0|Ugh.  This was a train wreck.<br />Here's the train cars involved in the wreckage:<br /><br />* Timelines: Detailed days sandwiched by huge gaps of time.  It's like watching that Tom Cruise movie \\"Far and Away\\", when they just magically fast forward six months at a time.  Gappy.<br />* Motives: Some of the characters do *amazingly* irrational or stupid things at times to force fit the story into the desired ending.<br /><br />(Spoilers below)<br />* Characters:  The drama/anguish over which Gale vs. Peeta got worn out in the first book, stupid in the second, and just plain silly in the third.  And it never developed or progressed, until magically resolved itself at the end.<br />* Reality: Boobytrapping an entire city?  That's just friggin' ridiculous.  Suzanne did her darnest to make a third hunger games.  Let it go...<br />* Reality: Shooting down bombers with explosive arrows?  It was dumb in the movie Rambo.  It was dumber here.<br />* Reality: The event that 'causes Katliss pain at the climax ... seriously?  seriously?  that's all you could up with.  so lame.  And in a world with death trap arenas, flying cars, and crazy killer mutations, *that* was the most unbelievable part of the series.<br /><br />It's a pity.  The first book was so good.  Rue's death (and Katliss' visit to District 11) was one of the best scenes I've ever read.<br />But this book?  It was like the author was stung by tracker jackers ... mad, rambling, confusing.<br /><br />I still gave it two stars, because ...<br />* Katliss' speech was epic.<br />* The continued interaction between Pres. Snow and Katliss was chess-matchy enough to warrant note.<br />* At least it brought some conclusion to the story.  It could've been worse - Robert Jordan - worse.<br /><br />To quote Peeta:  Real or not real?<br /><br />*awful*
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I'm not a fan of Nick Jonas what so ever, but I do know that he was actually on Broadway before he was a Disney star. In fact he at one point played Gavroche on Broadway. I was able to ignore his poor performance though because I was so taken back by talent of Norm Lewis (Javert), Lea Salonga (Fantine),  Samantha Barks (Eponine) and my personal favorite Ramin Karimloo (Enjolras). Ramin has previously played, The Phantom of the Opera, Raoul (from POTO), Marius (Les Mis) and is currently playing Jean Val Jean at the West End. His voice is like nothing I have ever heard before! Definitely a great cast.

0545140323|4.0|Do teenagers still like The Beatles? This is a question that came to mind as I read The Lonely Hearts Club. Elizabeth Eulberg's novel is brimming with Beatles references, from the awesome cover to the name of the main character, Penny Lane Bloom. I'll be interested to hear my students' response to all the Beatles trivia; honestly, I bet they won't even notice it.  The Lonely Hearts Club is a fun, breezy novel about what happens when heartbroken Penny decides to swear off dating and form The Lonely Hearts Club. Rapidly, many other disillusioned high school girls join up and begin to improve themselves and their school. Penny is happily baffled by the popularity of the club until she realizes she's not ready to swear off dating.  The self empowerment message is fairly simple in this novel, but may be exciting for readers who are experiencing it for the first time. I liked that Penny stood up for herself against an ingratiating ex and a pretty psycho classmate. I can easily imagine my bold eighth grade girls rooting for Penny. It's worth adding to your shelf.

1451627289|5.0|Like so many people I am an avid King fan. & reader. I know when his books are coming out & I pretty much run out & buy them asap. When I heard about 11/22/63 I got really excited & I had a feeling I would enjoy it....and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />As other reviews I'm sure have said before, the book is about Jake Epping aka George Amberson, who is given the chance to go back in time. He can only go to the same day in 1958 & will have to wait 5 years until he can accomplish what he's there to do (prevent JFK from being assassinated). And really those 5 years in between is where the real story is. The book is slower but in a deliberate sense & you really get to know Jake & a myriad of other characters. There is a lot of action too because Jake/George needs & wants to test the waters to see if it's even possible to change the past.  So he has plenty to do before that fatal day in 1963.<br /><br />I really loved the book. You can tell that King did a lot of research for this book, it really shows & it 's his most non-fiction, fictional book yet. My love for his books was rejuvenated with Duma Key a few years back but I didn't enjoy Under the Dome as much. And 11/22/63 has brought me back again, as King always continues to do. I imagine he always will.

I look forward to reading the other Blossom Street books.  This book as are the others within the series are very easy, light reads. You do not have to be a knitter to enjoy the Blossom Street series. I would definitely recommend this book and others in the series.
0385342063|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Kinsella even though I have been hearing her name for litterally years now. I don't know why I haven't tried her books before now but there you have it.<br /><br />So I was pretty excited to start this book and see what all the hype was about with her work. And I have to hand it to her, she managed to make me laugh out loud within the first few pages and smiling as I read on.<br /><br />I absolutely adored this book. The characters were so loveable and real and I just felt that istant connection that I love from a good book.<br /><br />You know what I am talking about, where you instantly care about the characters and are rooting for them and feel all of the emotions they are feeling. I absolutely LOVE books like that and I am so happy that this was one of them.<br /><br />The fact that this book took place in England was even better. I don't know why but it made the characters are the more loveable to me and made me want to be a part of their world.<br /><br />There was some swearing in this book, okay there was a lot of swearing in parts which really I didn't care for, I don't love the f-word, I just don't so I was a little put off by that but other than that minor detail, this was a fantastic read and I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone that loves a really good well written contemporary romance that is just down right believable.<br /><br />Poppy (isn't that just a great name?) was so fabulous. I love how caring she was and funny and okay, a little meddling at times too but always in the name of goodness. She was just one of those characters that felt so real to me. Someone I would be friends with and just love hanging out with.<br /><br />Sam was just fantastic. Everything I really like a good solid character to be. He was strong and no nonsense but still caring and insightful and genuinely was a good guy. I love how little by little we got to see him more and learn more about him and ultimately fall in love with. It was hard not to care about Sam and all his gruffness.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is an amazing writer and I am so sad that it took me so long to try one of her books. This will not be the last one I read, in fact I plan on looking for some of her others books and soon as I get done posting this, this book was that good.e Kinsella is an amazing writer and I am so sad that it took me so long to try one of her books.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|Everything I expected. Great quality. A Disney fans must have to the collection. What are you waiting for..... get it!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|What I liked best about \\"Thor\\" was how the writers of the movie chose to approach the existence of these \\"gods of Asgard\\", treating them as extraterrestrials that the primitive cultures of Norway mistook for immortal deities. Therefore, the entirety of Norse mythology was created as a result of the visitations from these alien beings. As I'm not a huge comics fan, I'm not sure if this is consistent with canon of the comic book, or a deviation, but I think it was a really smart idea. Granted, the entire plot requires a massive suspension of disbelief... but if you can't do that, you probably shouldn't be watching a movie based on a comic book about Odin, Thor, and Loki ;)<br /><br />But with all the insane sci-fi and supernatural occurrences in this movie, the part that's the most difficult to swallow is how quickly Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman) fall in love. After just two days, they are HEAD OVER HEELS in love. I'm talking about \\"I'll go the ends of the universe for you!\\", tears-in-my-eyes, kind of love. Maybe if they were teenagers, but these are two grown adults! It's pretty silly, and I tease, but all kidding aside, the actor who plays Thor does a great job, and so does Natalie Portman. Also surprisingly good is Anthony Hopkins... I mean, I know he's a great actor, but to pull off the role of Odin? I should have known better than to doubt him J<br /><br />This was a great movie for a Saturday night- fast, fun, boasting beautiful visuals (looks unreal on Blu-ray... especially the world of Asgard), and one of the better Marvel movies of the past few years.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a book that I couldn't put down and I have to say that this is by far one of my favorites.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This animated movie is a breath of fresh air, in terms of visual fidelity... Whether the animators are throwing beach balls, bikinis, umbrellas, floats, or flamingos at the screen, this movie is a FEAST FOR THE EYES! I watched it on Blu-ray on a 1080p screen (no 3D), and it was simply marvelous. The colors... dear lord, the colors. The amount of time and effort that must have gone into creating this picture simply beggars the mind. The attention to detail is incredible.<br /><br />The story is not revolutionary, as it's typical animated fare, but it's quite good, and it warmed my heart on more than one occasion. Furthermore, the songs in this movie are great, as many of them have a Brazilian inspired theme, and they're quite different from anything I've heard in other animated movies (Nigel's villainous number takes the cake).<br /><br />Five stars, without reservation, from this adult viewer. I assume kids will love it even more than I did :D
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I am a zombie genre fan... nothing like a good biological attack run amoke to get the imagination going.  Max Brooks delivers a fun read running the gambit of a world wide zombie pandemic.  Especially enjoyed the ever changing venues to provide varied insight on the human stuggle against the undead.  Max's style made it an easy read and kept me wanting more.  Unfortuately, I was also left wondering what is the rest of the story with each vinuet.  But perhaps that added to overall read... leaving the rest of the story to my imagination.  Understand they are making the book into a movie... hope hollywood doesn't screw it up too bad.

B000002KHH|5.0|I'm an old fan of Black Sabbath so I've been looking for some of their music. One of my favorite songs is War Pigs from the Paranoid album so I've been looking for that particular song. I like the somewhat newer version of that song from this album compared to the original song. I've tried downloading this song from different places but was never really happy with what I got. I found the Paranoid album on Amazon.com which I recently purchased and now I have the exact song that I wanted. I purchase alot of other music from Amazon.com and I'm very happy with them.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I decided to write this review to help skew the plethora of bad reviews that have been posted for Mockingjay.  While I understand and empathize with the negative reviews, no book is ever going to please everyone.  The series ended exactly as it should have, while staying true to its characters and the central plot.  No, it wasn't a bliss-filled ending, and yes there were points that were glossed-over perhaps a little too flippantly, but overall Mockingjay is every bit as good as its predecessors.  What I like about Suzanne Collins is that she tells a very real, very human story in each of the Hunger Games books.  Mockingjay is no exception, and even goes so far as to complicate our feelings about Katniss, who is a complex and flawed heroine in many ways.  There are times in Mockingjay where you find yourself thinking she is overly cold, calculating, and vengeful.  And then there are times when you realize she is merely a product of the Capitol's infinite cruelty.  What would you do?  I found myself cheering her at the end, for *SPOILER ALERT!* not being duped by the promises of District 13, or Coin's dubious agenda.  Her final vengeance was exactly as it should have been.  Collins took a bold stride in creating Katniss.  I predict her character, as well as this series, will be read and studied timelessly, alongside such masterpieces as Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and Brave New World.  The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that I felt parts of the ending were wrapped up a little too neatly.  Don't read on if you don't like spoilers.  When Finnick is killed by the reptilian mutts, it reads like an afterthought.  Indeed, like Katniss, we have no time to consider the loss of his character, nor to mourn him.  Secondly, even as a man I was taken aback by the way Katniss surrenders to her fate with Peeta.  She never really chooses between him and Gale, she simply accepts that because he shows up to join her in District 12, that she must settle for him.  This  struckme as a very anti-feminist sentiment.  As the person holding the choice in her hands, Katniss should have asserted her preference, not the other way around.  Of course we were all rooting for Peeta, as the author intended us to do, but after everything she experienced, Katniss ends up accepting the decision handed to her, a glaring side-step away from her character's strength and independence.  Overall Suzanne Collins has left the world a masterpiece of allegorical fiction, and I highly recommend that anyone who has started this series not be shied away by the poor reviews.  It is 100% worth reading, and minor disappointments or not, you will be glad you read it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy the whole game so far.  Music is nice &amp; relaxing.  Graphics are colorful &amp; appealing.  Nice job.
B004V2AWKG|2.0|The Giver did not spark my attention. It was very boring and I found myself thinking of other thignss while reading this book. What I didn't like about The Giver specifically was the ending. I found it very difficult to read because you don't know what is happening to Jonas. The ending just plain didn't make sense to me as the reader.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this APP! Its lots of fun to play, if you only have a little time to play or a long time it will have you hooked.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game really satisfies my boredum,and it was free!  I might have even payed for it. The music is kind of lame,  but i like it more than the Angry bird song :-p

B0066W1AZK|3.0|Really good for a free app. as long as some of its minor issues don't bug you. It almost always said stalemate when I clearly won. It only said i won once.No big, but what kills it is it doesn't seem to let you do certain legal moves, that I could even deal with. THEN I find the computer can do those moves, but I can't!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love it super awesome very addicting.  I have been playing it all day and just cant stop!!  lets see how far I can go!!
B005HI7NP0|5.0|I totally lost track of Betty Wright after her run of 1970s singles and albums. I'm embarrased to say that I didn't even realize that she was still recording steadlily in the 80s & 90s. But hearing this stellar new album I want to go back and hear what I missed. This new recording is a revelation. Betty sounds GREAT and the songs on this album are terrific: a few classics and a bunch of other keepers. Not a dud in the bunch. And considering that there is over 70 minutes of music on this CD (wow!) that is saying at lot. Very impressive. Kudos to the guys in the Roots for doing a fine job of support. They blend in seamlessly and don't overpower the singer. Betty Wright doesn't sound like she's lost any of her soul and sass over the years. I agree with some of the other reviewers: this was one of the very best albums of 2011. Get it!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|realy cool its not to loud. and also has a vibrate so its realycool app.  its usefull and helps people.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|if u enjoy mahjong you will love this app. the game is really fun I could not put it down.
B003M6RN8G|5.0|Such a beautiful episode, extraordinary way to conclude the show. One of the best finales I've ever seen. I wasn't sure about watching the Epitaphs, but they were amazing and surprisingly emotional. The only thing I would say is that it's better to watch both Epitaph 1&2 at the end of season 2 instead of seperately.
B0055V6EZE|1.0|I'm not usually one to write reviews, but this album was so disappointing I had to come to see what others thought.<br /><br />Its not the bad album that sparked the reviews it was so many 5 star reviews that did. Many people talk about how horrible the voice is and still gave 5 stars.<br /><br />His voice is truly horrible, and whomever ok'd this album for production should be punished. The voice is horrible, and what remains is far from what I'd call special or noteworthy. So what we're left with is a mediocre effort from a music lover. Nothing worthy of charging the public for.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|multiple ways to get to the end. can't put it down. using kindle fire no issues. excellence mahjong and puzzle game.

B00395ZYVS|3.0|I just finished \\"Secret Daughter\\" and found it to be a disappointment, especially the ending.  The plot was fragmented and too much was left dangling.  Needless to say, I would not recommend the book to anyone.

B004UID2LC|3.0|I was convinced that this app would cause a virus in my KF, Im still suspicious though. HOWEVER some people have been complaining that you can onlly listen to the suggested music, but if u look in the top right corner of the screen you'll see a small search tab. its good for music not as much videos. I'd rate this 3 stars...
B0067Q42BY|3.0|It's a good game but they need to lose the ads.  Unfortunately, I won't be buying another G5 game because of their practices.  What a shameful way of doing business.

B004SBQAN8|4.0|This was a good enough translation of the book. I like the story. Liked the actors and the SE, too. I got this for Christmas.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The game is very cool because is different and out of the tradition. You have the opportunity to save and continue the game later....and the best of all is that you have the chance to play in different level. Its awesome!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Simply put, if you know Mahjong and like it, this one won't disappoint you.  The game has great production values and runs very smoothly on Kindle Fire.  Along with just a standard match the tiles type game, you have a fun quest that sends you to various locations to play.  This is shown with nice background graphics, and a simple but somewhat interesting story.  A small but great feature is that it can zoom in automatically to keep the tiles as large as possible with every one of them in view.  This should make it a lot better for phones and smaller screens.  A lot of people have complained greatly about ads.  This game does *not* have any conventional banner ads or other ads during play.  The only \\"ad\\" you get is when you start, you are shown a list of the dev's games.  Just tap play, and you're in ad free.

B005YDLJ76|1.0|Beyonce is great as always, but this DVD contains blocks that she performed long time ago and the concert is interrupted by different shots from backstage.  Well, I will not comment the show or song selection too much. Her voice and performance are simply great. But the disc was a bit of disappointment for me. It started with the review of her beginnings. The very same story as on her previous DVD from Las Vegas. The same thing about how she started singing when she was 5 and the same story about her father sending producers home because Beyonce was not ready at that time.  Then, the concert is interrupted by strange cuts from backstage. Not sure what that should mean. Why in the middle of a song ?!?!? That belongs to bonus tracks !!! How can one replace half of a song with rehearsal from changing room?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a fun app if you like mahjong.  I have been playing the storyline and it is both challanging yet intertesting. It will keep me occupied for a while!
B006B31AHM|5.0|Leave the Farm. We beg you please leave the Farm.  Please? Its now been 6 episodes on the Never Ending Farm.  Is this Green Acres now?  I love this series but it can be so much better.  To the regular cast add someone different such as a Gilligan's Island professor, Seal team member, manipulative politician, Gordon Freeman, Black Eli, Gordon Krantz, G-man, celebrity-Samuel T. Anders, dumb kid teenager Luke Skywalker, crazy person clepto or similar where group has to deal with them or go Robert Neville and have the series start looking for a cure.  You don't have to find it just start looking.  Without warning walkers change they get smarter human intelligence.
B000N7KTBU|4.0|This is a good little enclosure. It works as expected, runs a little hot, and is really light and compact. It will get the job done if your goal is to reclaim an old 2.5\\" SATA drive. It isn't a long-term solution because it is cheaply made, and it isn't the prettiest enclosure out there. It is, though, inexpensive and functional.

030771652X|4.0|I read this along with a couple girlfriends on my Kindle.  Even though I didn't pick to read this book, I think I still would have read it eventually based on the synopsis.  I don't typically read mystery/thrillers, but I guess I don't necessarily place this book in the typical thriller category with Stephen King or James Patterson.  Rosamund Lupton was a new author to me since SISTER is her first novel.  Again, I am thrilled to find a new author that I can follow and someone whose first novel I really liked.<br /><br />Right away, you know that the character's sister has died, but you don't know how and the novel takes you through many twists and turns all the way to the absolute last page of the story.  It had me literally sitting on the edge of my seat as I was reading through the last 2 chapters.<br /><br />The story is told to me the reader as if I am the dead sister.  So, it took some getting used to as the living sister (Beatrice) is recounting the events of her sister's (Tess's) death through the telling of a letter as well as through the telling of the events to a lawyer.  There are divisions in the book so you know when there is a change in the telling of the story, but at times it was still confusing.<br /><br />The story is set in London. Since I have never been to London I am not familiar with the places the writer talked about, but her descriptions allowed me to easily picture the parks, the weather, and the scenes in the story.  I also appreciated that I was reading it on the Kindle and could easily find the definitions of the British terms that were used.<br /><br />Another great perk to reading on the Kindle is being able to highlight certain passages along the way.  A lot of my highlights were common to other readers.  They were things I wanted to remember and sentences that made me pause to think.<br /><br />In some cities birds can't hear each other anymore above the noise.  After a while they forget the complexity and beauty of each other's song. Some have given up birdsong altogether, and faultlessly imitate car alarms.  Page 14<br /><br />Usually time alters and affects everything, but when someone you love dies, time cannot change that - no amount of time will ever change that - so time stops having any meaning.  Page 55<br /><br />People think it's reassuring to say, \\"life carries on\\"; don't they understand that it's the fact your life carries on , while the person you love's does not, that is one of the acute anguishes of grief. There would be day after day that wasn't the day you were found; that hope, and my life with my sister in it, had ended.  Page 58<br /><br />Our mind is who we are; it's where we feel and think and believe.  It's where we have love and hate and faith and passion.  Page 110<br /><br />If equal affections cannot be, let the more loving one be me. Page 190<br /><br />But grief is the ultimate unrequited love.  However hard and however long we love someone who has died, they can never love us back. At least that is how it feels.... Page 195<br /><br />She pans life for gold and finds it daily....only learning the words to describe a wonderful world, refusing to know the words for a bleak one and in doing so linguistically shaping the world that you inhabit. Page 279  This last one, I really loved.  What a happy way to live.<br /><br />This was definitely a page-turner and kept me interested all the way to the end.  There were shocking twists, but towards the end of the book, I did figure out the murderer.  But the author still found ways to bring more twists at the end.  I was a little disappointed in the ending. I was left wanting more and a little unsettled, but still was left with hope for the character.<br /><br />This would make an excellent book club pick as there are lots of discussable topics including grief, trust, relationships, and genetics.  The topics in this book are heavy and may not be for everyone.  Cystic Fibrosis is featured in this story and has brought this horrible disease and it's treatment to the forefront.<br /><br />SISTER has won several writing awards including the Best Debut of 2011.  Rosamund Lupton has since written another novel titled AFTERWARDS set to be released April 24, 2012. I look forward to following her writing career and am sure she will find great success.  Be sure to check out her website,  [...] for more information.he Best Debut of 2011.  Rosamund Lupton has since written another novel titled AFTERWARDS set to be released April 24, 2012.

B0041T4ML4|5.0|'\\"The Windup Girl\\" is a hard book to read. The author starts slow and keeps the pace low for the first half of the book, nearly lulling the reader into a tracelike state of thinking nothing interesting will ever happen. Then the book explodes into a chaotic mass of very deep plot, action and intrigue and the pace goes from zero to Holy Crap in 6.4 seconds. The author keeps the high paced action going until the end, and it makes the whole first half worth the endurance. All in all, not a perfect novel by any means, but a great finish and great read.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z by Max Brooks was a great retrospective novel about the near destruction of the human race by zombies.  The book is written a few years after the war officially ends, each chapter told by a different person, getting a very wide array of perspectives on the war.  I loved how the whole story was presented as a factual government report, after reading the first 50 pages, the novel read so logically that I nearly thought this event had actually taken place.  I think that Brooks captured the essence of each character that is interviewed and presents them in a very realistic manner.  From the burned out soldier that has seen too much death to make it after the war, to the opportunistic corporate CEO still in hiding for marketing a fake cure, to the child whose parents tried to kill her to keep her from being turned into a Z, to the doctor who attempted to treat \\"patient zero\\", these tales stick with you and are told with such passion that it doesn't matter that they are fiction, you WANT to believe it.  This book is not the typical post apocalyptic zombie tale.  What this book lacks in action it makes up for in humanity, both the good and bad sides.  I couldn't find anything wrong with this book other than I wanted 200 more pages and more characters to hear from.

B002ZG9800|1.0|I had only moderate hopes for this film, and it disappointed on almost every level. I must admit that I saw this movie through another popular streaming site [Which shall remain unnamed]... and even though it was free, it sucked.. It's being touted as a gay-themed film, which, as a gay man, I found it quite offensive, because it's not, & it's not very entertaining. The only line in the film to provide a decent chuckle was when Carrey's character exclaims \\"it's expensive to be gay!\\".. but one line does not make a movie, and that's only true if you're pretentious & extremely  shallow.  Ewan McGreggor was the only bright spot in this slop.. but it wasn't enough to save this piece of junk, and his character was very weak.<br /><br />  On a commentary note: one reviewer said this film was \\"anti-Christian\\" & \\"pushed a pro gay agenda\\"...WTF?!?!? In whose eyes?? Pat Robertson & the warped opinions found on the 700 Club??? This couldn't be further from the truth. There wasn't anything to suggest this film was \\"anti-Christian\\" in any way, unless you're going by the MPAA rating... and most importantly, why are you watching an R Rated movie looking for pro Christian morals??? I'll never understand why most Christians maintain that anything \\"gay\\" equals \\"anti-Christian\\"... Most often it's generally the \\"Christians\\" themselves who are \\"anti-Christian\\" because most are judgmental bigoted hypocrites living in glass houses in a fantasy land.... but I digress..... The movie was not \\"pro-gay\\" nor was it \\"anti-Christian\\", anymore than it was \\"anti sports\\"..it just flat out sucked.. 'nuff said..

B005TPCQ5I|1.0|Let me start off by saying that we love romantic movies.  Love them.  I saw the ads for this movie and thought, \\"This will be a great movie, and I may cry\\".<br /><br />Fast forward to last night when we finally rented and watched it.  Worst decision ever.  Let's talk about what's good: the movie had great music that represented each year of their story.  I loved the classic 80s, 90s, and today. Took me back.  Now the rest...<br /><br />There was no chemistry between the actors, no empathy for either of them, the female role for Anne Hathaway was just pathetic (As was the ever-changing British-esque accent), and there was no redemption.  The movie just kept going and going with nothing funny or redeeming.  Skip it. There is nothing cute, nothing romantic, nothing to make you look at the one your with and go \\"awww\\". If anything, you will look at each other and say, \\"wow not only were their lives two big mistakes, but us watching this was one too.\\"<br /><br />Do not rent, buy, or gift.  It's just not something you will be able to live with afterwards.

B000O8OTNC|1.0|Bought this to use in the field so I didn't have to lug around a stone.  I tried it out on my high carbon camp knife and it really dulled it down just using the ceramic. Not a pleasant surprise since I was deep in the BWCA and just south of the canadian border. Had to borrow my friends stone to get the edge back.<br /> I believe the angle of the sharpeners to be around 23-25 degrees(I didn't measure, just eyeballed it), and I keep my camp knife at 20 degrees.  So the sharpener was actually changing the angle of the grind, and basically dulling my knife.  23-25 degrees may work fine for some people, but I keep field knives at 20 and fillet knives at 15 degrees. I'm a little confused by all the positive reviews, but I would tell people to stay away from this sharpener.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great gameplay and graphics worth the price and really fun.. Picked it up as a FAOTD but would pay full price for it.

B005KELW26|5.0|I ordered this case because the color was sharp and it was a basic, easy to use case.  I LOVE IT!  The material looks great, protects the kindle in my purse, and even has a little pocket for notes, etc.  It won't protect the kindle in a fall, but definately keeps things from scratching it.  If you are looking for a basic cover to your kindle, this is a great choice.  No bells and whistles but does what it says it does!

When we were on vacation in Australia, I trasferred my pictures to the iPad and reviewed them and deleted the ones that were not very good.  This saved space on my camera card.  I purchased this item from Amazon.

B004EI3ON4|5.0|This is a superb soundtrack and is possibly better than the movie for which it was made.  It will be great for fans of electronic music but also for fans of classical music due to the orchestra used to make this music.  I think that every song on this soundtrack is awesome and there are really no songs that are not good.  I surely think that many people will enjoy this music.  Enjoy your many hours of listening to this great music.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going Nuts is one of the best games  I have downloaded onto my tablet since Christmas and I love it! I cannot stop playing! I think everyone should get this game!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun! It works well on my Fire and I haven't had to force close or freak out about it not working. There are a lot of ads. You earn points from playing the games, and use those points to get more mini games. Its free because there are many adds and you can pay to get points. It is very fun, and worth the space! :)

B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. I like the goals and the fact that you can purchase upgrades to help reach the goals.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game a lot of fun. Can not stop palying. I would tell everyone about it. I LOVE MAHJONG ARTIFACTS.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family or a date or for friends.  I had movie night with friends (all of us being the age of 40 and over), and we all LOVED it.  My husband does not cry in movies, and he said he was moved by this one.  My husband even cried.  This is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all times.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games!! they are so fun and all are pretty easy to play...I'm just writing this pretty much to get points do... get this game!
B0006J28BO|5.0|There is alot of screaming and a little bit of whining with the main character however, this movie is very well put together and a wonderful story line. Ghibli movies are a bit of a hit or miss but the attention to detail in this particular movie is a major plus! Love characters, the the story, and the animation is really kind of sweet. I saw this movie first before I saw the Whispers of the Heart and had some questions in my mind after watching it which Whispers of the Heart answered. Warm, heartfelt, sweet, enjoyable with mystic, quirkiness, and adventure. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Beautiful graphics and music. A lot of fun. Quest mode teaches you how to play and many puzzle shapes are available
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is great, I use it every day to listen to passages while commuting! Many different visions, easy to use.
B003UYUR10|4.0|This movie may not be perfect, but it's still got a lot of charm and some amazing visuals-- for 2 hours, your HDTV will be transformed into a glittering chest full of golden treasure. It's a fun adventure romp set in the ancient world, and although it may rely on some overused tropes to get the job done, it's still an enjoyable Indiana Jones-style ride that will take you to some pretty amazing places. I'm a big fan of the game it's based on, and even though it's only minimally accurate, I can at least understand the changes they made (although I don't think it would have killed them to at least call the princess \\"Farah\\" and put her city in India). If you go into it with an open mind and knowing that the story is not a game changer, what you'll find is big adventure draped in lavish, exotic visuals.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a great game. It works on great on my game. Really worth the money. I hope they come out with a second version.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|After a campy sequel and the two decidedly \\"meh\\" Alien vs. Predator movies, this is what the Predator franchise needed-- a new violent, gritty action survival film that not only takes the franchise back to its roots, but also expands the mythology in some very cool ways. The action this time takes place on an unknown alien planet that serves as a game preserve for the predatory Yautja race, who have kidnapped humanity's deadliest predators and dropped them on the planet to hunt for sport. Even though this movie may not have Arnold Schwarzenegger's star power like the original did, overall it is a step forward for the franchise in terms of direction quality, story and acting. Pretty much the whole cast for the movie deliver memorable performances, and I was especially surprised to see Adrian Brody convincingly portray a bad ass but intellectual mercenary.<br /><br />This is not a sequel to Predator 2, and it seems to mostly ignore it from continuity. It's not a full reboot of the franchise either, since it is a sequel to the original film. Perhaps we need to coin a new term for it, but regardless I am glad this is the direction they went in for it. It's a gritty, modern-day followup to a 80s action classic that successfully brings the franchise back to what made it great while also moving ahead. It's fast; it's brutal; it's Predator.
B006ON41FC|5.0|very good game addicting like temple run but never the less great game cant stop playing it never makes me bored
B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick-Ass is not a typical superhero movie-- it asks the question \\"if you were a bored comic fanboy decided to become a superhero, how far would you take it?\\" It's based on the comic by Mark Millar, although in my opinion it's better than the comic-- like most of Millar's recent work, the comic was extremely cynical and paints a very grim portrait of all the characters in it. The movie takes a more sincere approach-- one might argue that it's not as \\"realistic,\\" but hey, what's so realistic about a 10 year old girl in a superhero costume driving a meat cleaver through a criminal's head, anyway? If you are game for an extremely violent film about costumed vigilantes with no powers who have no qualms about killing the bad guys, then you'll love this. It's gritty, but at the same time it's got a great sense of humor and an odd sense of sincerity-- unlike the original comic, it ultimately sides with the notion that even though living as a superhero would take a serious toll on you and force you to do some rather questionable things, the superhero is still a noble ideal that can inspire people to be more than just another pebble in the road.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has 101 games the only downside is that you have to earn points to unlock other games but in other words it is awesome I couldn't explain it any other way.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|If you're clicking on this, chances are you know by now the basic premise behind this movie, so I'll cut to the chase-- this is a great Blu-Ray. The transfer is about as good as it gets for a low-budget 80s action movie, and it comes with a good amount of special features. If you're interested in the digibook, I'd say go for that version since the book has some good supplemental materials, but if you just want the movie this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />There's no fate but what we make!
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|We purchased this album and were very happy with it.  If you like Kanye West, you will love this album.
B004RE29PO|5.0|I remember the first time I borrowed a VHS tape of this movie from the library. I had heard stories about this movie, and seen pictures, but nothing prepared me for what a rollercoaster ride of suspense and bad-ass action I was about to experience. This is the movie that every other man-vs-alien movie wants to be, but few have succeeded. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you owe it to yourself to watch it. If you have seen it, rest assured it got the royal treatment on Blu-Ray-- it probably looks better on this disc than it did back in theaters in the 80s, and as with its predecessor, you get both versions of the film and some nice special features. It's one of my favorite movies ever, and it's one of the best Blu-Rays you can buy. Unless you want to spring for the Anthology set, this is the best bang for your buck you can get with this movie.
B005FNJL7K|2.0|I attended the 2004 recital of the Lord of the Rings Symphony with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra conducted by maestro Howard Shore.  I was 'transported' by the music and waited at the stage door to compliment Mr Shore on a magnificent performance.  I have been waiting the release of this piece on CD for some time (and hoped that the Sydney performance might have been recorded for release) and eagerly ordered this version when it became available.  However I found it somewhat disappointing and not up to the standard of either the movie soundtrack or the live performance in Sydney. Not being musically trained my music vocabulary fails me.  However the CD recording lacks the full richness of tone of the original versions, coming across as rather 'austere' and 'restrained', almost like an experimental modern work.  I also agree with another reviewer that the vocals fell well below the standard set by both the movie and the live Sydney performance.  I am now waiting to see if other orchestra versions are subsequently released.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is one of those strange little gems that only happens once in a great while. It's a big budget movie from an American studio, directed by a popular British comedy director, and based on [[ASIN:1932664084 an indie Canadian graphic novel series]]. Obviously, condensing such a long series into a movie is a tricky endeavor, but somehow Edgar Wright manages to make it work. It's funny, action-packed, has some great music and oozes with ridiculous amounts of style. This movie is an eclectic fusion of rock music, comic books and oldschool video games that mesh together into a package that is nothing short of delightful.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough that this movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. It's fight scenes feel like a video game come to life in the best way possible, and really cements the fact that the Street Fighter movies have no excuse for sucking as bad as they do. There's also some great songs written by Beck, as well as a bunch more from numerous artists. If this movie is your cup of tea, I highly recommend picking up the soundtrack. And while you're at it, pick up the video game on Xbox Live or Playstation Network-- it's a pixelated blast from the past that will make you feel like a kid again!
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Best jazz/soul/grown-folks CD I've listened/exhaled to, in quite a while. Love seldom-sung standards, so \\"Imitation of Life\\" was my entree, followed by one of the best vocal versions of the oft-performed \\"Work Song\\" I can recall.<br />And while I enjoyed the nine originals on first-listen, it's ultimately these G.Porter-penned tunes that put this CD atop of my everyday playlist.
141690977X|5.0|I read this book 7 years ago and it gave me confidence not to waste my time on losers who weren't ready for a commitment. I just bought it for my 20-year-old sister who keeps meeting immature boys. Lucky for her, she is still young and has to go through a lot of heart aches to find the right one, but in the meantime, hopefully this will help her to weed out guys that aren't worth her time.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I use this to film my younger, active boys running around and during their sports.  The quality is far superior to the internal mic of my Canon T3i.  I have the camera's audio set to \\"manual\\" and the volume usually just above the lowest volume.  Before shooting I go into the audio settings and adjust the level so it peaks at the yellow marker.  I tend to run on the +20 setting as I find it's easiest to capture louder audio from the microphone and lower it in post rather than regret that the volume was too low.  The price was high, but I'm definitely glad I bought this over the much larger non-Pro version as I've seen lots of comparisons since and would feel strange with a microphone that large on my camera.  The VM Pro is just small enough to look somewhat normal up on top.  I compared this against the \\"stereo\\" versions but am almost always glad I'm not capturing too much background noise in my videos.  My voice from behind the camera is also very adequate.  I've been using it for about 6 weeks now and I'm still on the first battery.
B006ON41FC|1.0|since this app nags me all the time to rate it then im giving it one star.  It force closes when the nag screen comes on so it ruins the game.  So &quot;END Games Entertainment&quot; is this the rating you wanted when you forced me to rate your game?
B006OFN0SE|1.0|Why was this movie made?  Was the world incomplete without a J. Edgar Hoover biography?  There was about as much of a demand and need for this movie as there was for TWO movies about Truman Capote within one year.  (Remember the year of those two inane disasters?)  What's next for Clint Eastwood...a Pauly Shore biography?  I have always respected and admired Clint Eastwood, but I would not accept this movie on DVD or Blu-ray if it was given to me.  Maybe I would accept it and use the disc as a coaster for drinks.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had a 7506 for many years, and the sound reproduction is fantastic.  Mine finally literally came unglued (not sure replacement headphone pads will suffice) after well over 10 years of use, so I need to get a new pair.  I was a bit surprised that the price is still the same after all these years, but then, they're great headphones--and if the research I've done on the 7509 is accurate, the 7509 isn't necessarily a step up and costs 3 times as much.  The frequency response of the 7506 is 10Hz to 20kHz, whereas that of the 7509 is 5Hz to 80kHz.  My first thought was even if the human ear could discern that high of a kHz.  After doing some research about that, I found that the human ear (unless I'm mistaken) cannot discern anything CLOSE to 80kHz--the highest value I found was about 20kHz.  I also saw that other users on here were talking about a hollow or \\"wooden\\" midrange sound on the 7509.<br /><br />So once I'm done with this review I'm going to buy a new 7506 to replace my overused one.  The coating on the earpieces does flake off a bit after a pretty short time, but mine never flaked off entirely or even close to entirely, and the phones are very comfortable.  Definitely recommend the 7506.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I'm addicted to it! I think you should buy this game. Its amazing and fun and GREAT for kids bored in the car. BUY IT! Its like a 3D kinda game. I suggest you get this super game. ENJOYABLE!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The story is interesting and the game keeps you intrigued.  The puzzles start out very easy and become more challenging as the game progresses.

1577314808|4.0|A few summers back, a loved one gave me a copy of A New Earth [[ASIN:0452289963 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)]] by Eckhart Tolle that she picked up at a church sale. That book was the sequel to The Power of Now, and to be honest, I preferred it to The Power of Now. That does not mean I didn't enjoy this book - just that I found A New Earth to be more worthwhile. The basic premise of The Power of Now is that we live in the past and in our hope for the future, and replay certain memories over and over, and that we should be fully committed to the Now. There is a lot of truth to this. Tolle tackles many subjects including Ego, The Origin of Fear etc. (from Page 73 - \\"Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego's fear of death, of annihilation...For example, even such a seemingly trivial and \\"normal\\" thing as the compulsive need to be right in an argument and make the other person wrong - defending the mental position with which you have identified - is due to the fear of death. If you identify with a mental position, then if you are wrong, your mind-based sense of self is seriously threatened with annihilation.\\") For me, the book started picking up around Page 90 when Tolle wrote \\"For example, it is estimated that as many as 50 million people were murdered to further the cause of communism, to bring about a \\"better world\\" in Russia, China, and other countries. This is a chilling example of how belief in a future heaven creates a present hell.\\" On page 216 in a chapter entitled \\"Dissolving the Collective Female Pain-Body\\", Tolle writes \\"For example, certain races or countries in which extreme forms of strife and violence occur have a heavier collective pain-body than others. Anyone with a strong pain-body and not enough consciousness to dis-identify from it will not only continuously or periodically be forced to relive their emotional pain but may also easily become either the perpetrator or the victim of violence, depending on whether their pain-body is predominantly active or passive.\\" On Pages 241-242 in a chapter entitled Using And Relinquishing Negativity, Tolle writes \\"Once you have identified with some form of negativity, you do not want to let go, and on a deeply unconscious level, you do not want positive change. It would threaten your identity as a depressed, angry, or hard-done-by person. You will then ignore, deny or sabotage the positive in your life. This is a common phenomenon. It is also insane.\\" On page 265, Tolle provides good, healthy advice \\"Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, \\"Is there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?\\" If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the 100 things that you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you can do now.\\" I remember times in my life where I'd worked in psychologically \\"unhealthy\\" work situations, and wish I'd had this advice at that time. But then again, it is also a human trait to get a sort of \\"high\\" out of complaining about a life situation, enjoying telling people how miserable you are in a situation and not doing something risky such as leaving a job because you've talked yourself into thinking it's the best you can do at a given time. Tolle deals with these issues on page 267 when he writes \\"You say that you are conscious of your unhappy feelings, but the truth is that you are identified with them and keep the process alive through compulsive thinking. All that is unconscious.\\"  I remember reading a book by another author, I believe was Ted Andrews, and he wrote that you should take out what works for you from any book, and throw out what doesn't. There are things in the Power of Now that I don't agree with, but there is also plenty that is worthwhile. So my advice is to read this book and cherry-pick what works for you, what adviceyou find to be constructive. It is an interesting, but not always perfect tome. Enjoy.

0380778556|4.0|Rebecca follows the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter from the time she meets Maxim in Monte Carlo through the rough first year of their marriage. Set at Manderley on the Cornish coast, the new Mrs. de Winter must contend with the overwhelming presence of the first Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, kept alive by the creepy housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. The new Mrs. de Winter becomes obsessed with Rebecca and everything to do with her while also struggling to step out of her shadow.<br /><br />I actually found that it took me longer to read Rebecca than it did with Paige Harbison's New Girl. I am not sure exactly why - I think it was mostly just a slow reading week for me.<br /><br />I would not have known about Rebecca if it were not for reading Cristina's (The Princess of Storyland) review of New Girl. I had no idea it was a young adult retelling of a classic. Beyond that, Cristina recommended that I watch Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Rebecca, so I did. I enjoyed both Daphne du Maurier's book and the movie. And if you are wondering, yes, I believe Paige Harbison's version keeps true to the original while making it modern and available to a younger crowd.<br /><br />If you have read New Girl, you need to read Rebecca and vice versa. In Rebecca, the new Mrs. de Winter's first name is never revealed and in du Maurier's Author's Note, I learned why: she simply could not think of one. I found that interesting because the lack of a name seems like such a good plot device.<br /><br />Recommended for lovers of classics and anyone who has read New Girl. Also, I found out there is another book based on Rebecca called Rebecca's Tale by Sally Beauman.<br /><br />Google \\"The Musings of ALMYBNENR\\" to see this review in its original format and to follow my book review blog.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that it is quick and easy, also that everything is laid out so nicely and fast to get the info you're looking for.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Downloaded for free a day or two ago and I'm still working on it.  The game has a kind of storyline as you work your way through the map and makes it more interesting.  Adds a little something different with different tiles that will cancel out specific other tiles. Keeps you thinking and entertained.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun game and enjoy playing. different twist off the original game and scoring makes it fun too. will play often.
B003M0H4NG|5.0|Timeless.  A truly monumental piece of music. My Favorite part is the blending of electric guitars and electric piano, it's magical and fits with the acoustic instruments as perfectly as the most intricate table puzzle ever designed.  My only regret is not buying this 30 years ago. Get the legacy edition w dvd and watch these masters at work.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Whether you call it a remake of the 2009 Swedish film or an American adaptation of the novel, this English-language version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has arrived. In the interest of simplicity, I'll refer to it as a remake hence forth. The books by Stieg Larsson are quite popular in America and the Swedish films have been seen by a pretty wide American audience given their foreign nature. I have never read Larsson's books, but I've seen all three of the Swedish films based on them. The films, particularly the first one, are so accessible to the average American moviegoer and are so widely available that an American version just seemed strange and unnecessary. When David Fincher, riding the wave of universal acclaim from [[ASIN:B004HWT6DO The Social Network]], signed on to direct and cast up-and-coming actress Rooney Mara as the iconic Lisbeth Salander, my doubts were lessened. The announcement that newly minted Oscar-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would collaborate with Fincher to again provide the score didn't hurt either. There is no use comparing Fincher's version with Niels Arden Oplev's. It's not exactly apples and oranges, but it accomplishes nothing. It's a more effective measure to analyze this on its own merit rather than nitpick and compare every aspect with the film that came before it. Fincher's style is so prevalent that it's easy to believe he didn't take any inspiration from the previous adaptation, having adopted a style and tone for the film that is all his own. If he goes on to direct the sequels, the overall atmosphere alone will make them easy to distinguish from the versions before it. Additionally, I won't say one is better than the other for several reasons. One is that this version is much fresher in my mind and another is my feeling that this version loses an edge because of my familiarity with the story. A lot of suspense or mystery that may have been handled more effectively here may have been lost on me. Regardless, I'll get on with it.  The film quickly sets the tone with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) receiving a framed drawing of a flower at his home on Hedeby Island. The screen goes dark, Trent Reznor's atmospheric rendition of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song starts in, and the stylized, gritty opening credit sequence begins, hearkening back to Fincher's earlier career directing music videos. Enter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), writer and co-owner of Millennium Magazine, who fears he has ruined his reputation after losing a libel case to a wealthy businessman. Meanwhile, lawyer Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff) has commissioned an extensive background check on Blomkvist from Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker and researcher for a security firm. Her report convinces Frode to introduce Blomkvist to his client Henrik Vanger. Impressed with his investigative reporting skills, Henrik wants Blomkvist to help him solve the 40-year-old murder of his niece Harriet under the guise of helping him write his memoirs. Though a body has never been uncovered, Henrik is convinced that his niece was murdered by someone in his own family. Everyone on the island is suspect and Henrik makes Blomkvist an offer he can't refuse.  The film jumps back and forth between Blomkvist and Salander, who don't team up until quite late into the movie. With a runtime of 160 minutes, there's no real need to rush anything. There's a very memorable, graphic scene in the Swedish version that involves Salander, her guardian, and a tattoo gun. I recall watching this scene, knowing an American version was in the works, and being flabbergasted by it. There was no way I could fathom that scene being depicted in a mainstream American film. The American version of Let the Right One In was too afraid to recreate a single shot for American audiences (if you've seen both versions, you should know the shot), so how was Fincher going to get away with this? To my surprise, he did get away with it and this harrowing, graphic torture scene is just one example of his refusal to sanitize the violent and sexual nature of the film. He promised this would be a hard `R' and he delivered. Never before have I seen an R-rated film and thought `how is this not NC-17?' To see this content play on a movie screen in a large, corporate theatre is a validation of what driven, stubborn directors can do with total control over their vision. A lot of the graphic nudity and violence depicted here in unheard of in a mainstream American film. You'd be lucky if you could find some of this stuff at your local art house theater.  Since Fight Club, Fincher has adopted a unique style that becomes more developed with each passing film. There are several scenes here where he goes full-Kubrick, mastering his grip over the sinister and the ominous. I bring up Kubrick because Fincher has become adept at creating a disconnected atmosphere that casts a spell over the audience. Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth give The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a dark and grungy, yet sophisticated look that takes advantage of Sweden's weather to lend itself to the overall atmosphere. This atmosphere is most potent in flashback scenes, creating a whole separate mood. There are some incredible shots here that should bring Cronenweth richly deserved awards recognition, as this one of the most well shot movies of the year.  Reznor and Ross deliver a score that actually heightens the effect of the material, moving in such perfect sync with the film that they become codependent with one another. I was not as impressed as I was with their work on The Social Network, but it may just have been more subtle or lacked the same freshness. Whatever the case, these two have the potential to do great things for movie music. It comes as no surprise that Fincher has wrangled terrific performances from his cast. Craig makes a great Blomkvist, assured, but not too arrogant. It's a great example of his acting range, as he effortlessly transitions from the fearless James Bond to the confused Blomkvist. Stellan Skarsgård as Martin Vanger...Damn. An actor with plenty of work under his belt in two countries, he deserves more roles of this sort.  Finally, there's the controversial casting of Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace's earlier performance became so closely associated with the character that people would have been up in arms if she had reprised the role herself. Mara made a big impression with her brief scenes in The Social Network, but this performance shows what she's really capable of. It's a remarkable transformation and she's in total command of the screen when she's on it. With her beauty completely obscured under the strange hair, piercings, and makeup; she's tough, troubled, and fascinating. She's occasionally sexy too, but this comes not from physical attributes, but the confidence in her performance. I'd have to watch the two performances in close proximity to say for sure, but Mara may give a more psychologically complex performance that Rapace. Her performance is brilliant.  Fincher knows of his talent and this film is a more assured directorial effort, especially in regards to his ability at handling drama, suspense, violence, mystery, etc. His talent has made The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo stand as its own film. That's not to say it's perfect, with an epilogue that seems to stretch a bit too long. However, the final scene, a new addition, wraps everything up and has more bite than the Swedish version, making this one pack a more emotional wallop. It's an enthralling film that has carved a place on my top ten for the year, a welcome and different breed from the typical film to find its way onto such a list. The story is a high-minded mystery yarn, tailor-made for this century that would not be the success it is without its memorable female protagonist and the talented filmmakers bringing the story to life. Unlike most of the year's best films, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is little more than supreme, well-made entertainment. I'll be surprised if it's nominated for any Academy Awards beyond acting, directing, photography, and music. Its status as a remake certainly won't help it receive additional accolades. Fortunately, I had high hopes for this and it totally delivered. I hope Fincher goes on to direct the next two installments so I can see what else he has to offer the series. It may not be a \\"great movie\\" in the traditional sense, but it has all the cinematic ingredients of one, coupled with great entertainment and potent atmosphere. It's nice to see a potential franchise unabashedly geared for adults. I hesitate to call it \\"one of the best films of the year,\\" but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of my favorite films of the year and is more of an achievement on a cinematic level than many of the films superior to it.  GRADE: A-
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so cool because there is so many games to play it is one of the best apps ever
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really like this game. I don't know what to say, I like the game, it really makes you think about your moves.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Down loaded this game to have something to past the time. Challenging and rewarding with trying to obtain all the artifacts. Very fun.
0307408833|4.0|Not all of these recipes are gluten-free, but it's okay!  The ones that are gluten-free (most of them) are EXCELLENT.  I have been baking cakes from this cookbook for over a year now and I have started to really get the hang of it.  I have been able to make adjustments to the basic recipes to suit my own tastes....without bizarre and disastrous results.  I even devised my own wedding cake recipe based off of one of the tea cake recipes in this book.  I feel as though this book has \\"taught me to fish\\".  I find that these recipes are too sweet for me, but they work just as well if you reduce the sweetener.  I cannot afford coconut oil, agave nector or evaporated cane juice (all of these are called for) but these recipes work just as well with canola oil and granulated sugar.  Some of the reviews complain about the use of bob's red mill all purpose flour mix, but I find that it works well in the recipes that it is called for.  No gluten-free mix is really \\"all purpose\\" but this cookbook only suggests using it when it will fit the purpose (the amazing chocolate chip cookies for example).  Really the only recipe that I have made from this book that was a disappointment was the vegan icing, but luckily I am not vegan!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this app is very entertaining. I am just as addicted to it as I am solitaire. zoom is nice since tiles are small.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I don't  normally  enjoy  mahjong  games, but this one kept me playing.  Nice graphics.  Lots of detail.  Easy zoom helps make the tiles clearer.  Nice job.

1594744769|4.0|Jacob, a young boy, has been listening to his grandfather's tales about \\"monsters\\" and other mysterious beings for as long as he can remember, and he is certain that his grandfather has simply been making his tales up. The photographs of the strange children with unusual abilities are just faked pictures.When grandpa really starts \\"losing it\\" and says the monsters have at last caught up to him, Jacob thinks the man is crazy. But then the grandfather is found murdered and Jacob himself catches a glimpse of a \\"monster\\". Now his own father thinks Jacob is crazy but...he isn't, and neither was his grandfather as Jacob will learn when he goes to a mysterious island and enters into a tunnel which is a \\"time loop\\" and in another world of sorts actually meets the very children his grandfather talked about and showed him pictures of. These are the \\"peculiar\\" children living in Miss Peregrine's home. Each child has a special power, making fire, flying, invisability, etc which is why they're deemed peculiar. But each child is also in danger as the \\"monsters\\" are real and they are coming to get them to destroy them. The plot is fun (if a little derivitive of the X-men,which is also about individuals (mutants) with special powers, but very well done. While reading this book, I found myself thinking of another good Young Adults book called \\"The Necklace of Stones\\" in which a young boy finds a necklace of stones granting him similar such powers (great strength, flying, etc.)and which allows him to go to other worlds. Why not buy both together if you have a youngster who loves good and original fantasy stories. Both books are wonderful for Young Adults.
1932100660|5.0|Fascinating and worth-reading, this book clearly supports a plant-BASED diet, not a 100% vegan diet. A mostly vegan diet with a small amount of meat/fish and little to zero dairy is what I feel the evidence supports. I think he proved himself to be a less objective scientist than he claims by making a completely vegan dietary recommendation. He condemns doctors for not believing patients would be willing and able to follow a plant-based diet, but then recommends patients follow a 100% vegan diet because it would be easier for patients than just having a little meat or fish. Not only do I disagree (I think the diet is easier with a little meat allowed), he also makes the same mistake of telling patients what is easiest, not what is healthiest. I'm more interested in what is healthiest, not what is easiest. My only complaint is that I wish  he could have remained more objective. For reference, I myself am mostly vegan and feel much better eating this way than eating an omnivorous diet. I do suspect that for some people, a small amount of animal food is required to feel and be their healthiest, while others would be perfectly fine on a completely vegan diet.
B0067FGYGQ|5.0|This is really great. Not just \\"another singer-songwriter,\\" SVE has mastered the minor-key, melancholic song that is straigtforward and free of melodrama. The arrangements are usually pretty spare and restrained -- a guitar, drum, maybe an organ/electic piano. The focus is very much on the songs (which are generally very strong) and not on the production. SVE has a strong, rich voice -- she makes me think of someone like Beth Orton. The highlights are probably \\"All We Can,\\" and \\"Ask\\" which start slow and builds gradually to a crescendo that reminds me very much of Roy Orbison. A very strong album overall.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy solitaire and logic puzzles. this game was very interesting, easy to learn, and a fun way to kill some time.
B000UX6OHK|4.0|I lusted after this watch for several months before finally purchasing for my birthday.  It really is gorgeous, but if you aren't careful it will scratch pretty easily and the clasp can come undone. Not a watch to wear to work.
0670022705|5.0|In my opinion, I think that this is a very good book to read because it provides you information that can be helpful in any situation.  I am an overachiever who prides herself on knowing things, and I, as an overachiever, recommend this book to ANYONE who wants to see things from a different perspective while gaining knowledge. I now see things differently, and I think differently about objects. It also is in an enjoyable, entertaining format with good pictures.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Fun to play with good graphics and sound. The tutorial is short and informative. It's a five dollar game for free. If you don't like Mahjong then you won't like this so don't download then complain.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A lot of thought was put into the game. I am enjoying the quest mode. Perfect game for when I need a distraction.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Great movie, Yul Brenner still scares the daylights out of me everytime I watch this movie.  Great Price and fast service. well buy again from this seller.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Fun game. If it were not free I still would buy. Even on my cell phone the graphics are great.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|What a Great game good game play graphics are good glad I got it free but still worth the cost too!!
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This is a crude movie that is totally unrealistic and hilarious!  Leave your serious, adult responsibility, common sense behind and just watch it for what it is a totally ridiculous comedy that will make you laugh - a lot!  I thought the writing was really funny, the casting was great, and the acting wonderful.  I watched the unrated version and I thought there was a lot of really funny parts.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Best Mahjongg game I've found. Great storyline and good play. Smooth transitions from game to game. Tile art is fantastic and sound effects are good. Get this game if you like Mahjongg.
B005STGKI4|5.0|This has always been my favorite Foo Fighters album, primarily because this is the one record of theirs where they simply cut loose. The vinyl has long been out of print and was notorious for sounding poor. This new reissue is part of the entire catalog repress on vinyl, all cut by Chris Bellman. I have to say on this album he did a fantastic job. The vinyl is clean and standard weight, spread onto two LPs. The vinyl is in poly/paper sleeves inside the cover which is not a gatefold. But the price is nice and the vinyl cut so well that I can live without all the original artwork. That being said the front and back cover are very well printed.<br />There's also an mp3 download included, but who buys this for the mp3s?<br />And this will blow away your CD. There's all the little things that a well mastered LP will reveal over a compressed CD. A steal for around the $20 price point when the crummy sounding original will set you back at least $100.<br /><br />Arrived perfectly from Amazon in their new designated record mailers.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|Many fun little games, and I enjoy the sudoku game a lot; however collecting credits to unlock new games can get redundant.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game on the kindle fire.  Lots of levels to play.  I like the ability to increase the size of the screen.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Awesome game! Really addictive. like the graphics and gameplay. and cant beat the free price that I downloaded it for
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun game for me and my son to play. Great little story line. Would recommend to my friends. Great app.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This is a very fun game that really challenges me. I get pretty ill at some of the more difficult challenges, though. They're getting tough.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Pretty fun, great time killer! I like that there is a pause option so that you can stop if interrupted.
B006ON41FC|5.0|graphics are really good, kinda a battery hog though. very addictive. wish the crash reactions were better, ie blows up with fireworks or.blood with.owl

0061353248|5.0|\\" I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do\\" (Romans 7:15, NIV).<br /><br />Have you ever wondered why people act foolishly instead of wisely, dishonestly instead of with integrity?<br /><br />The author, Dan Ariely, summarizes the findings of over a dozen experiments and-with great sensitivity and humor and enthusiasm-synthesizes the results in a fascinating and well-reasoned conclusion: \\"we are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend.\\"<br /><br />This is not as depressing and fatalistic as it sounds.<br /><br />Rather, Ariely suggests that since we can predict with some precision how people will react in different situations, we can use these tendencies to help people make better long-term decisions. The book Nudge draws a similar conclusion.<br /><br />If you are looking for a deep book, one with excellent research and challenging conclusions, then I give this book my highest recommendation.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I am addicted to mahjong of any kind!  I'll download any I can find. This one tries to add a twist with the artifacts but all that really is is a fancy way of giving you a different set of tiles and a different background. Big deal, I could do that myself. Plus the artifact levels are so easy I finished the whole thing in one sitting. Also I would like to be able to turn off the tutorial. I don't want to watch it everytime I start a new game. The music is repetative and gets old quick. All said, I'm glad I got this one when it was free.
B002BWP49M|1.0|The wife and I enjoyed the previous movies but this one was just total garbage!!  It's as if someone handed the movie over to a bunch of 5 year olds and was like have fun! I think this is the first movie I've Red Box'd that I felt ripped off for paying $1.50. I know everyone has they're own opinion and I respect that but the fact that there are people out there that think this is good cinema scares me!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I've had none of the problems mentionned by others. The temp is always there when I turn the Fire on and no problem getting local weather.
B0002NIRIC|5.0|This string cleaner is exactly as I expected to be. The application method is easy to use, just like the lemon oil. It gives the strings a brilliant shine and instantly removes dirt and grime. It also provides more playing ease, but it doesn't lower the noise of your fingers sliding around. Another thing that I might add is that it has a nice, subtle citrus smell to it that goes away once you wipe down the strings. However, I have not noticed a significant difference in tone or life span. It just makes it a little nicer to look at and a little nicer to play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|excellent timing and options. Ads only appear when you start a new game. I like the fact you can choose one or three cards to draw.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|As an iOS user switching to Android, I encountered something that iOS could perform natively that Android could not, open RTF files. I am am avid Dropbox user and upon trying to open am RTF file, it could not open it. To add some background, I had both Quickoffice and Docs to Go on my Android already. To my dismay, both of those failed to open my RTF. So I did some research and found that this app allegedly could fill my need. So I took the plunge and never looked back. To my ultimate satisfaction, this app handled the RTF file with much finesse. In addition to this, I find its interface pleasing and performance is fantastic! I cannot recommend this app more, as a user of the three major Android office suites, this one is the best. I'm also using a Droid X1
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Must admit that I only knew about this book because I loved the musical since I first saw it on Broadway. I was a bit intimidated by the length of this novel, but it is well worth the read. It moved me to tears, made me re-examine my connection to God, and even made me laugh every now and again!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game rocks on my Acer tablet. Always loved mahjong, this game does not disappoint. Different setups are cool and the quest familiarizes you with the matches.
0767811070|5.0|This movie does so much so well it would be criminal to forget it, and it's hard to know where to begin singing its praises. Incredible cast, incredible script, authentic sets, authentic costumes, great editing, great soundtrack? It's all there, but the movie's greatest strength is its honesty. Singleton doesn't go for overt style, he doesn't try to sell a soundtrack on the back end and he doesn't try to create a dramatic series. He simply tells us an honest story about the real issues black kids faced during a period of time in South Central LA and in so doing helps us understand a culture we really wouldn't have a better glimpse of without. Singleton does so much more for all African Americans with this work than any and perhaps all political figures who've tried to represent them because he shows that African Americans share the same aspirations and goals, have many of the same issues as any one else, though in this setting danger, fear, paranoia and lawlessness threaten any kind of normalcy a family might hope for.  I lived in the area as a child, during the same time frame the main characters did when portrayed as children. I also visited the area in my teens, when this cast is in their own teens. This movie is spot on all around. A powerful masterwork that I hope is never forgotten.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|This film was named the best film of 2011 by UK's Empire Magazine!<br />I was expecting a taut and lean heist film with actions and good acting.<br />This is the result:<br />The casting was good, with Ryan Gosling headlining and supporting cast by Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman and Carey Mulligan.<br />The cinematography was able to show the gritty side of LA, especially during the night.<br />The action sequences were ably directed.<br />The film score tried to be retro Miami Vice and eclectic but failed at both end .<br />The film had a weak beginning and seemed pretentious at times.<br />Any serious heist or revenge film has to have a strong backbone story with logic and motive.<br />The backbone story of this film was based on the relationships between the loner/mechanic/ stunt driver, the girl and her son who live next door.<br />The characters including the hoodlums were not given enough story materials to feed the narritive.<br />Instead the film makers relied on shocks and violence to propel the movie along.<br />This film does not qualify as an art house actioner (watch In Bruges, Disappearance of Alice Creed or Bad Lieutenant).<br />It is not a noteworthy film.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Freely makes it so easy to read my Blogs.  I love everything about it!  It synge with my Tootle reader so I always have updated information.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|If you haven't watched this film, go see it.<br />It is an excellent action film and the best in the series as many had claimed.<br />See it in IMAX if you can.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love it!  The geography of the game would be great for kids, especially if there is a map nearby. the graphics are great and the music is not annoying. Much fun. Easy to understand if you play mahjong.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Yes, it is a very well-made film with a good story, strong cast and production value.<br />Yes, it may be George Clooney's best performance in a film so far.<br />But............. this film does not stay with you.<br />Would this be enough for the Best Picture Oscar?
0062082353|3.0|I've been reading a lot of memoirs and autobio's of military folks lately, so my review of this book will be categorically based. Though I appreciate Chris's valor and determination to serve, I feel this book just doesn't have much to it. I was immensely bored at times and simply had to skip parts. If it had been my first military first-hand read then I may have had a different opinion (i.e. I may have given it 4 instead of 3 stars) but it truly just doesn't compare to other reads similar to it. If you're looking for a good military experience first-hand book, read Lone Survivor by Luttrell.  Thanks again for serving, Chris, but this book just had too many unexciting, drawn out moments. It did have its positive moments, though, thus a 3 out of 5. But the good didn't outweigh the boredom.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I often wonder why would Hollywood remake any well-made or popular foreign-made films.<br />Does Hollywood run out of ideas?<br />Does Hollywood thinks US audience cannot comprehend foreign films?<br />Does Hollywood believe they can improve upon the foreign made films?<br />Whatever.<br />I have seen all 3 Swedish made films on DVDs.<br />They were expertly made but I can't say I was totally overwhelmed by them.<br />Until I saw this David Fincher remade, in the theatre.<br />It is a flawless remade and notably improved upon the original.<br />But I still prefer the original girl.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|awesome game. highly recommended. it walks you through a game to help you understand what to do. download now for a neat challenge.
0316044695|5.0|This is a great and memorable book!  The quality of writing is truly first rate.  The story operates at many levels like a very good novel.  It's the best SEAL book I've come across and you'll thoroughly understand what it means to get \\"wet and sandy\\".  You'll also understand what makes Afghanistan and the war there so unique--totally different from Iraq and other wars.  The last 1/5 of the book--the story of how the author survives--comes as a total surprise.  I was reading the book on my kindle and was about 4/5 done.  The text was describing the end of an intense battle and I was thinking, \\"Hey, how's this guy going to survive...this book's gotta end about now.\\"  Just then, however, the story totally switched gears and launched into a entirely different phase.  What was a good book, became a great book.  Totally unexpected!  Don't let anyone tell you the end and don't peek at the end!  If you're interested in getting a soldier's perspective on both Iraq and Afghanistan, I recommend reading 4 books: American Sniper (Iraq), Joker One (Iraq), Lions of Kandahar (Afghanistan) and Lone Survivor (Afghanistan).  These books are very different in perspective and story, even though each country pair takes place in very nearby places.  American Sniper and Joker One relate battles in the same city, but are very different books.  Together, the four books will deepen your understanding of war and change your current view.  For me, I am much more pro-soldier and seriously skeptical Washington DC's willingness to start wars.  Our recent Presidents and political elite seem way to willing to start wars without a willingness to win and end them.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is better then the regular mahjong. it has more options for a treasure hunt for artifacts. the original game only matches tiles. this is a lot more fun.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I bought this for use on my Nikon D7000 and landscape photography. I have the Nikon ML-L3 wireless remote which is battery operated, so I wanted a backup just in case.<br /><br />The MC-DC2 securely plugs into the D7000's GPS port on the left side of the camera, out of the way of frequently used buttons or switches. It works out great for me, as now I don't have to worry about a battery failure in my remote and I prefer to use the remote with my left hand. It works just like the camera shutter button, as you simply press it halfway down to focus, and then the remainder of the way to trip the shutter. Once you trip the shutter, you can slide the button forward just a little to lock the shutter in the open position for those long exposures. A very nice feature !<br /><br />As other reviewers stated, perhaps some photographers may require or prefer a longer wire; but I don't see that it will be a problem for me as I do not want to get too far away from my equipment during a long exposure.<br /><br />Very satisfied and would highly recommend this product !!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie I would suggest to anyone.  It touches all of your senses and  the story is wonderful. Good movie that teaches values.
B000683VI4|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it instantly.....I am the daughter of a couple who have been married 60 years and I must say when I watched this movie, it reminded me of my parents love for each other through all the trials, tribulations, joys, and adventures of life...Two years ago, my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and my dad is determined to take care of her until the very end....Now, everytime I see this movie, it reminds me of the true meaning of being married \\"for better or worse, for richer or poor, in sickness and in health\\" and the committment of true love through the ages!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|After reading all the negative comments I was leery of trying the game,but I am so glad I did. Very fun and hard to put down. I am really enjoying this game. I am playing on Kindle Fire. No problem with download. Works great.

0316067598|5.0|This is honestly one of the most amazing stories i've ever read, or heard about for that matter. This book hits every emotion. There are parts that make you laugh, things that make you proud, things that will bring you to tears, and events that will have you in awe that something like this really happened. I would recommend this book to anybody, even if \\"Military\\" books aren't your kind of book.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|As with most posters I must agree that Liam is not quite as good but he grows on you. Naevia however was replaced due to the delay of taping of Vengeance and took another job on NCIS NY or CSI NY due to the length the show will run. Finacially better for her. I feel season 2 Vengeneance is pretty good. The supporting cast has stepped up to remove all the burden placed on Liam for success.Andy was very good. To all those about the athletic thing I ask of you, do you really think that there was a weight lifting regimen in place for gladiators and soldiers back then? I think not but it looks better on film and to the movie goer to see a lot of muscle. Not exactly that is how it was.  Great movies/ series. No complaints. I do miss Lee Ann Brandt  ( Naevia)
B004FOA84A|4.0|My first Android game. What fun! Some of the graphics were blocked by other images but, all in all, good times for under a dollar. Fire Maple Games done a good job.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy having this solitaire on my Kindle Fire.  If I wake up in the middle of the night and just can NOT fall back to sleep it's a quiet activity to play without disturbing my husband and helps to make me sleepy again.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Another great game from Fire Maple Games!  Awesome graphics and nice audio accompaniment. Wish they made more apps.  It was a bit difficult without the hints. Then again, maybe I need to work on my logic skills. Ho hum!

B002OEBMN4|5.0|The most recent Slayer album to be released is compared mostly to Seasons, which happens to my personal favorite. It seems like a fair comparison as Slayer visit many different tempos and styles here. You have the over the top agressive songs, unit 731, public display of dismemberment, snuff, not of this god, hate worldwide, psycopothy red. The mid tempo songs, human strain, playing with dolls, americon, and then the other songs that have a little of everything, world painted blood, beauty through order. Lombardo mixes thrash and blastbeats with breakneck fills in public display of dismemberment. Araya once again turns in a pretty versatile vocal performance similiar to the range he showed on seasons. Americon is the only song I usually skip. It just doesn't seem to fit the vibe of the album very well and disrupts the flow a little. I would rate this right up there with Slayer's very best.
B006ON41FC|4.0|What a pleasant surprise. Great little game.  Runs great on kindle.  continues to get more challenging as you go.  gave it a four only because there are slightly better games.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Works well,  threads aren't even noticeable as others make it seem like. Fun and addicting!(wrote this so it can be a 20 word minimum.)
B005COO1X6|1.0|So, I typically LOVE Stephen King stuff...adore it in fact.  This was not the case this time.  I was kind of excited to read something that was written just for the Kindle...and it was $2.99...so I thought there was no way I could lose.  Boy, was I wrong!  It starts out ok- kind of reminded me a little of IT, but a bit different.  After the first chapter, which isn't too terrible, it just goes downhill.  The 2nd and 3rd chapter were pretty much the same, except that there was a difference in characters.  The ending was kind of skipped out on...it was almost as if he got tired of writing (I am honestly surprised he made it as far as he did) and then said, \\"ok, I'll just slap any ol' ending on, wrap it up, and call it a day!\\".  The upside...the last 20% of the \\"book\\" is a preview of his new book (11/22/63), though I haven't read the preview yet, so I am not sure if it is really a perk or not.  I wouldn't waste your money...or your time on this one!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|good game so far one of the better games I have played on the kindled fire. the grafics are good and the game play well done
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using this app for a couple years now.They are constantly adding new tools &amp; resources. I love it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Its worth it and I got it for the free app of the day but its worth .25. its fun and entertaning
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great graphics.  Interesting 'new' tiles to add a good twist to an ancient game.  Colorful and challenging with some classic &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; story lines.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|The tiles are too small and makes it annoying to play. Also, ads on paid version and too complicated when you just simply want to play mah jong. MT4gSlide
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun- there's enough challenge to make it interesting and to make me want to keep playing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|so much fun! I've never played mahjong before and this is challenging enough without being too hard to learn with. love the storyline aspects. pictures, speedd, and design are awesome!  great storyline aspect, lots of fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game, it dealt keeps me occupied. also love how you have to unlock them as you go. makes it gunner in my opinion
B005K17RU0|5.0|The hour-by-hour display is incredibly useful. I use this app every day before leaving the house and I'm very rarely caught in a weather situation I wasn't expecting.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is really fun, easy to get the hang of, and addictive! I got this game as the free app a day, but would have paid for it any way. Well worth the money. I seriously don't know what I did with my life without this game. (;
B005K17RU0|4.0|great app. shows real time weather. wish it had a favorites page that shows all your locations instead of only your home location. does store all your favorites,but have to open other locations. you will like this app if you like to monitor the weather.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|keeps the game interesting and not so monotonous to have the comlcs inbetween boards.l love mahjong it has been one of my favorite games since I learner the computer.also really like the help tiles.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said?  Whether or not you agree with Richard Dawkins' arguments, you have to admit he is good with a pen.  I couldn't put his book down, so I am not surprised it is a best seller.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is fun. The only bad thing is you have to use the money you earn in the game to buy the other games. If your the person who likes mini games this is for you. It worked great in my kindle fire.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|I wasn't expecting much at all, in fact I just watched this movie because there was nothing else that I wanted to see.  As it turns out, I loved it.  Great characters, great story, great concept....  Just can't say enough good things about this movie.<br />S
B006ON41FC|5.0|I Love It!  It's Addicting.  Takes A Little Bit To Get Used To, But Once I Figured It Out, It's A Lot Of Fun!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love placing this game!!!!  It is relaxing and challenging all wrapped in one experience.  My second grader also likes the added mystery of finding the artifacts.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for anyone.  At first I thought it was going to be one of those movies where people cause a lot of trouble for others, and those make me uncomfortable.  It turned out to be a very enjoyable and inspirational movie.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is awesome going nuts is awesome and fun to play it is good to have if your child likes your ipad
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I love Glee! Owning the season was such a great idea... I love the extras where you can watch just the songs and not the whole episode.  So glad I bought this!!
B0061S073A|5.0|I live that I can hand my Kindle over to my 3 or 5 year old and I won't find $50 of random game purchases. Highly recommend!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I must tell you to read the review by William H Thomas \\"The closest thing to being at a live production\\" even if you don't read the rest of this.  I have been fortunate enough to see Phantom in Columbus, Cleveland and Toronto (not Ohio :) ) in the '90s.  Each performance was very good but, I fell in love in Toronto.  And now I'm in love again.  The Albert Hall performance, on video, ranks right there with Toronto.  You lose the affect of being IN a world class music hall, but you gain an almost personal connection with the cast and the story with the closeups and being able to watch the stage movements from higher angles.  It's like a movie but not, it's live and uncut.  They used plenty of cameras and were able to keep them out of the shots. This is NOTHING like a live TV play shot in a studio, someone did alot of preplanning to pull this off.  I didn't find a problem with the middle sound channel on my US BD as Mr. Thomas noted. I DIDNOT like the use of the LED panels. If ya can't do it right, don't do it.  That said, still watch this on the largest screen you can, you will become even more engrossed with the story.  If you're already a fan you must get this, I recommend the BD. If you're not a fan yet, you will be.  Ok, now get yourself a big mug of something to drink and read the review by Mr. Thomas.  It's rated the best, because it is.  BTW, I have a strong back round in music and was fortunate enough to have parents that took me to several first run on Broadway Musicals in the '50s and '60s.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great book. Thank you so much for putting out a 5th book. Can't wait to finish writing this review so I can go read it.  Hands down best book of the year, also got me into Molly Fyde series which was pretty good too.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going Nuts is a fun app. When I baby site this app is a must! When I baby site, I clean up after dinner, they will not bug me when I do the dishes. if they play this app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|An interesting twist to a great game. It's fun to have a story to follow. The graphics are great. Thanks!
B0067Q42BY|2.0|The game app is a nice one, the graphics are good.  The issue is not the quality of the app.  It is obvious the author can put together nice game apps.  The issue is the user, as mentioned by other reviewers, gets immediately get bombarded by adds from the same author announcing more of his games apps.  The other question is why does this game app needs full Internet access? Being as big as it is already, there should be nothing else to be downloaded.  It is simple the author needs to push his additional apps and irrelevant information at the bottom, pushing:  Follow us!  Sign Up Now!  Play now!  To make matter worst, you still get bombarded with more adds when you are about to play.  But wait, that is not the worst part, it claims to allow you to turn off \\"Show free tiles by default\\".  Well I was not able to see the difference after implementing this option.  There are several free app, which actually have less adds than this paid app.  Hence, I will be UN-installing this app.  To the author, since you are an expert in push apps, perhaps you should consider keeping your effort to take your game apps to the next level, and minimize the amount of adds.  Do this and you will gain a loyal customer base.  Thanks to Amazon I did not waste my moneys on this app, and made me aware which other game apps to stay away.  Hope this review can help you in your decision before you paid for this game app.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game has been hours of entertainment for me.  It is easy to learn and never gets old.  I love it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|one of the best mahjong games i ever played get it its great! its fast moving addresses different levels and is just plain fun
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|You know, this whole phase is killing the handheld gaming industry. No longer will casuals get the new handheld, no... They just play their terrible slingshot game on their phone and that's enough for them. And you know what, I don't really care about them, but without their casual dollars, the 3DS and Vita will fail, meaning I don't get any good games to play.<br /><br />Stop supporting this crappy game and acting like you're into it just because it's the hip thing to do. You know it sucks.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|The free version is excellent. The game can be adjusted to make the game more or less challenging. The only change I would suggest is to show prices that are removed from the board.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is great bc it has so many objectives that require different approaches. One goal might be to narrowly avoid trees while another might be to collect a number of specific nuts in a row. I love playing!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Oh yes,sitting in front of the T.V in 1974 watching this by myself,I had relatives that came over every Friday night. But from 8:00P.M to 9:00 P.M I was watching the tube.This defines the mid-seventies T.V like none other.  The  D.V.D restoration is perfect,so buy this and sit back and remember those days...the long wait for this great series is over.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great fun...flawless and fast on my motorola droid X2. Smooth clear graphics and intuitive controls. Good storyline, too. 5 stars.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I found this book to be somewhat cluttered.<br />It revealed some interesting things from Steve's NeXT/Pixar years but kept jumping around.<br />The narrative was very non-linear and did not delve deeply enough.<br />It was very surface glossed and focused on products.<br />I wanted to see more of Steve the person...<br />That is why I picked up a BIOGRAPHY.<br />Things I did like.<br /><br />The writing was pretty darn good.<br />It did not try to make Jobs into a saint.<br />It did not try to portray Gates as a thief.<br />It showed Jobs' strengths and weakness while TRYING not to get all fuzzy/glowy about him....<br />I know I kind of said that twice...but it is important.<br />Too many people paint this arrogant self-serving man like he was a saint.<br />He wasn't...but that does not negate some of the really cool things he and his company brought into being.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun game its very challenging. I love a good challenge. I like the variety of games they have for you.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun game. I love mahjong. easy to view and to play. I could play for hours. I play on the kindle fire
B006W0QOF2|4.0|This is the kind of movie which may not make a good impression the first time you watch it, though it matures in your brains as the characters stay with you.  Like Sterling Hayden in Asphalt Jungle, Ryan Gosling does not speak much, he is a silent hero, a bad boy with a soft side.  Not you typical action movie, more like a film about the redemption of the bad guy.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a fantastic app. I just have one suggestion. All options (notes, bookmarks, highlights, etc.) should be available OFF line. Then when the user later has an internet connection, everything done off line should automatically update.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|This app is a fantastic price, so you can't really complain about the cons. I personally found it annoying that the computer indicates which pieces you should jump with a HUGE ARROW. For instance, my husband was able to take 5 of my pieces at once in a series of jumps, and I'd like to think he wouldn't have noticed the last 2 opportunities. The computer TOLD HIM and I feel cheated!! :) I'm saying this all in good fun, though. My 7 and 9 year old children seem to like it, and I had some fun, too.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|the game plays well on the fire,  the ads are on the title page only. I took it for free, but would have paid, lots of fun. Thanks
B0063GORYU|3.0|This gave me something to do for a while.  Nothing extraordinary about it, just killing time for a while before bedtime.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game provides fun and entertainment. It is very much worth having on your device. Great game to pull out and play when you have a few free minutes.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun. I like playing the nuts game. All sorts of crazy nuts to grab.  Plus a skeleton suit to boot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Im 13. I thought this book would be too gorey and scary for me but when I bought it I was HOOKED! This book isnt as bloody as I expected but there was no lack in violence whatsoever! The post-apocalyptic civilization has cruel leaders. Most of the violence happens during the Hunger Games. Preparation for the Games as well as the events after theyre over isnt as bad but it shows how evil the government is. Im in the middle of the second book - not quite as bad but its still pretty scary. I wouldnt let my children read this until theyre my age or older! Still.... best book ive ever read.<br />Another side note: the descriptions in both this book and Catching Fire were really hard to understand. I couldnt get a good mental picture of it...
B0067Q42BY|3.0|a little different than other mahjong games. bonus tiles are cool. colors are nice. I don't know if I would pay 4.99 for it,but for free,it's a good game.
1427211760|4.0|Different kind of book.  Worthwhile, but different.  I'm not done yet, but they have introduced some interesting concepts.  I have the CD version.  Someone should have told the Zander's to just let him handle the voicework on the recording.  Whenever the wife speaks, I find myself hoping her section will end soon and the husband will commence.  I do find the listening worthwhile and there definitely are some very interesting tales that are told.  You are encouraged to view the world a little differently.  I hope I do so.
B0067LY4WG|1.0|Another in a long list of tuneless and nonsensical recordings of what are presumably supposed to be songs from a formerly (and now what was briefly a) great artist. This release sinks the artist further into the abyss of irrelevance. There was a time when he recorded classics: Leonard Cohen, Songs from a Room, and Songs of Love and Hate are three. Since then he has cruised, his voice getting worse, and while that can be forgiven, the fact that his lyrics have deteriorated into childlike nonsense cannot.This is made worse by the thoughtless adulation heaped on him for material that in thruth does not deserve to be released. The true sin is that it all detracts from his early music.  Mr. Cohen ought to emulate the hero in his his song Last Year's Man and do us all a favor. Life imitating art! (Actually I just think he should have the courage to stop releasing this tuneless drivel, and not take the easy way out like the hero in the song.) Don't waste you money. Listen to the samples, before not buying.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Completely satisfied.  Allows easy and seamless access to Picasa web albums.  Allows viewing of photos, as well as streaming of videos.  Absolutely best way to stream personal home videos to Kindle fire that I have yet found -- compelled me to purchase extra space on Picasa web albums.  Application provides great slide show capability, including random/shuffle.  Highly recommended.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|paid app infested with ads. stop this trend now. removed from phone. please remove the ads. ads severely hinder performance on start up.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|ode to Mahjong...how do I love ni...let me count the ways: Spring to Winter, numbers alike, bamboos alike, and great tiles take all.
B000067CIJ|5.0|the cd arrived in time. it was new and professionally wrapped. i love the sound quality. thanks a lot. you have a new and happy customer.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Came on time and I laughed all weekend!  Just waiting for season 5 to arrive...Oh, it isn't all on TV yet.  DARN!!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|good game! would Defo recommend. works and looks great on the kindle fire. even better it was free!  ,fdh hujvdd gyff huj
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I think it's better when I would like free I got it for free but I would not buy it for money
B006W0QOF2|1.0|I really don't understand the hype behind this movie.  Ryan Gosling basically looks like a ken doll and barely acts during the film. The plot is not particularly interesting and the ending is ridiculously unrealistic.  Boo.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|Can you say a stupid, futile attempt to make an action movie? The whole premise of the movie is so stupid.
B004FPXJOK|3.0|Ordered this last December, prior to recent unfortunate events, as a retrospective of the female music artist I would rate #1 for vocal talent but an underachiever for quantity of music output during her quarter century music career.  Was extremely disappointed with this release as an \\"Essential\\" hits package.  Most of her most familiar hits are on disk 1, but her best song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" is edited so the long last note of the song is cut off.  The second disc is mostly hard to listen to hip hop remix versions of her songs that do nothing to showcase her remarkable vocal talents.  Releasing this 2 CD set as two separate CD's makes more sense, since each disk appeals to a much different audience.  A superior hits package is the 2007 single CD release called \\"The Ultimate Collection\\", although this release also edits the ending of \\"I Will Always Love You\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My whole class thinks its the new twilight! I love it as mutch as twilight, and l'm a twiheart!  :Â£ i recomend it for ages of 11 and up
B0052U59F4|5.0|I loved the 50 Shades and Christian's Story touched my heart.  Having worked with children that were victims of abuse and neglect, Christian's story was classic of when these children grow up to be be 50 shades of screwed up. One layer at the time was pulled off and in these three books and I loved every minutes of it....Little costly but certainly worth the price.  This is a must read book, not to be missed.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. I liked the way it was set up and with the cartoons. Once I played I  was  hooked.
B005K17RU0|2.0|app was great, everything was accurate worked well... then after a recent update it cannot run for more than 5 Mins on my fire before it force closes.... annoying
B005T87QCI|1.0|sucks super hard and you cant even be atom or Zeus don't buy the game isn't thout out and just an all around bad game
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is an app that will not disappoint. Even if you are up on your game,you will be challenged. I'm rather satisfied with this.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I ordered this for two reasons: for my enjoyment , and for use in a Black History Program that I was producing for my third graders.  The collection of cd's is amazing and comprehensive!  I was so pleasantly surprised at this beautifully done concert that is somewhat recent that showed Michael Jackson in prime form.  I highly recommend it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like it ;D It makes me feel like I just accomplished something... I never finish anything.  I took my love down to violet hill... there we sat in the snow. All that time, she was silent still... if you love me, won't younletbme know
B003UYUP6M|5.0|Inside the Plex gives the reader a behind the scenes look into the inner workings of Google. Levy covers the Google story from the early days in Susan Wojcicki's garage to becoming a profitable start-up and into the current social media tug of war with Facebook. Levy's insider access leads to a number of interesting anecdotes (did you know Google wanted to accept goats as payments for ads in Uzbekistan?) and gives the reader  truly interesting firsthand insight to the story of the Google and its employees.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great me and my sister can't stop playing it. but if your an adult this game isn't for you!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|good graphics, easy gameplay, great mahjong game!  I really enjoyed all the different varieties of tiles.  honestly it could be a little longer.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Playing this mah-jong game is pretty fun, I like the animations and graphics then the stupid thing starts begging for a review. This is almost as bad as those apps with rediculous permissions. One star for you!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Only flaw, forcing me to rate it. Overall great game, fun and addictive! I like the mini goals, keeps you playing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've enjoyed this app. No problems,  fun and great time passer. The ads are kind of annoying but it's free do I'll get over it.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|Good game, but expensive,took a long time to download, and no customer service to find out about whybit gets stuck so many times on kindle fire. asks every 5 min to rate game well here you go, got to ch. 10 wont go any further, what a waste of money and time!
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|This book and the series are definitely not the feint of heart - the author does not hold the hand of the reader as you are introduced to the world of the Malazans and the Bridgeburners.  There is no convenient farm boy who doesn't know the history of his own world and as a result it is left to the reader to go through the journey of discovery for themselves.  The book has some of the best visuals in a fantasy series I have ever read.  [Slight spoiler but it's only twenty pages in]  My favourite has to be the scene of Tattersail in the middle of the field of armour.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Excellent movie! If you are a british mystery fan you will like this alot! I've watched it multiple times and still manage to catch new things in the plot.
B004SBX112|4.0|Awesome game useing a droid bionic and it really smooth but once and awhile it freezes please fix bought it because i hate ads
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|We bought this new everything was just what we ordered.  Took just as long as they said .  Great product and service
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Entertaining, good story-line, pictures. Not much more I could ask for. I love that it has a comicbook feel to it.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|A film like \\"Insidious\\" makes it look easier than it is for most filmmakers.  It's, at its core, an old-school ghost story done with such modern flair . . .from everything to writing, acting, casting, score, cinematography, sound, and special effects, that it leaves me to wonder why more filmmakers can't make horror films this superbly.  I am a jaded horror fan.  Horror fans are like drug addicts...we keep chasing the cherry high.  \\"Insidious\\" by description sounds like a story we have seen a thousand times.  Young couple buys first house, nice kids, lots of high hopes for the future, all of which is wrecked by a pesky haunting.  \\"Insidious\\" takes these tired ingredients and gives them more than a facelift...it has set a new bar for this sub-genre.  Patrick Wilson (Little Children, Hard Candy) and the lovely Rose Byrne (TV's \\"Damages\\", \\"Get Him to the Greek\\", \\"Knowing\\") star as the young, idealistic couple, Josh and Raneigh, who find themselves plunged into a nightmare when they come to believe their house is haunted and means them harm as their 7 year old son ends up in an unexplained coma after a ghost encounter. Josh's mother (played by the aging ever gracefully Barbara Hershey) brings in a psychic to investigate (another cliche), but what again, sets this apart is the panache brought to the character by Lin Shaye, a terrific character and stage actress.  She believes Dalton (the little boy) is a gifted astral-projector who has ventured too far away from his body.  I won't explain more so as not to spoil the twists, but the ensuing action is as terrifying as movies get.  Director James Wan, who cut his teeth on the original \\"Saw\\", infuses the films with energy, tension and unbearable suspense.  My heart was pounding through most of the film.  Did I mention there is a rather terrifying demon lurking about the house?  \\"Insidious\\" was made on a shoestring budget of only $1 million.  You would never know it in looking at the value per dollar on the screen.  First-rate actors, superb art direction and special effects, it looks like a $40 million film.  This gave Wan tremendous freedom to make the movie he wanted to make and the results are truly unnerving.  The movie has an uncommon intelligence...this is a couple that actually talks to each other and believes each other, where lesser movies hang the plot on this communication not happening.  I especially liked the fact that after a few incidents at their first home, they move.  This usually harkens the end of the film.  Instead, to the sickening realization of our characters and we the audience, the ghosts follow them, as it is not the house which is haunted, but the boy.  The characters make logical decisions making them easy to indetify with and enormously likable.  It helps to have actors of Wilson and Byrne's caliber.  I was riveted to this film, and if you're a fan of ghost stories, especially those which rely on atmosphere, story and suspense over blood and guts, you will be richly rewarded and long haunted even after the credits roll.  This is superior film, well worth purchasing.  I recommend the Bluray version strongly to see the nuanced details in the art direction and the perfect replication of the original photography.  Extras are light, which is disappointing, but the film more than makes up for it.  *Also available on Netflix streaming.
B000007VCM|5.0|Sounding raw and blistering with an aggressive swagger, \\"Love Removal Machine\\", the first track released as a single from \\"Electric\\" combined a pavement-hardened edge with jolting rhythmic force, and looking back 24 years, couldn't have been more diametrically opposed to \\"Electric\\"'s predecessor, \\"Love\\", the fluidly progressing, psychedically-tinged release that was, is, and always will be the apex of The Cult's recording career, and their one true masterpiece.<br /><br />Mixing together heavily-modulated riffing and endlessly inventive percussive flourishes with cryptic, quasi-mystical lyrical content that drew partially from the Native American mythos (the central focus of their debut \\"Dreamtime\\") and delivered in vocals that often times approximated a shamanic wail, \\"Love\\", succeeds at embedding memorable hooks and insistent grooves within a spectral atmosphere, and contains their most universally recognizable tracks (\\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", \\"Revolution\\", and \\"Rain\\"),which all found their way into heavy rotation both on MTV and college radio. And it's easily their most internally consistent release, due at least partially to Steve Brown, who helmed the recording and favored an expansive, liquidly resonant production that helped create a mix heavy with hard-hitting, heavily-atmospheric tracks with a sinuous organic flow, whether the track was somewhat universally wistful in nature( \\"Revolution\\") imbued with a sustained explosiveness (\\"Nirvana\\", \\"The Phoenix\\"), deliberatively incantational (\\"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon\\", 'Black Angel\\") miasmic (\\"Love\\") or steeped in hypnotic mysticism (\\"She Sells Sanctuary\\"). Never again would The Cult regain this level of almost spiritual intensity and overall cohesion, essentially peaking on their second release.<br /><br />My original cassette was another one of those favorites that was long ago worn into ribbons and levitated away in a cloud of particulate. I've also had to replace it on CD. I submit to you that this is one of a handful of releases which truly contributed a new wrinkle to the alternative music scene in the 1980's, before that genre was co-opted by corporate interests who might as well have been programming music by supercomputer, that it's well worth grabbing, and that you may very well find it as compelling, now, as I still do nearly 27 years after its release.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great design and fun gameplay.  Game can be addictive and that's a great thing when purchasing a app. I suggest you try it.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Tantalizing. Extraordinary. Captivating. Rebecca Hamilton filled the pages with beautiful, vivid, descriptive prose that easily transforms into images. I love when authors think outside of the box to describe a scenery or character, when they turn simple words into lyrical sentences, evoking emotions. Rebecca Hamilton does this, pairing it with a strong, fresh plot line and characters that carry the story(instead of the other way around).<br /><br />Sophia is the epitome of a perfect female protagonist. She is strong-willed, intelligent, open minded and is able to keep her wits and morals intact. She battles with her inner struggles in such a way that many readers will be able to relate to her, becoming dazzled by her as we live the story through her. Charles is also a fantastic character. Deep, determined and open minded like Sophia. We get to slowly scratch away his many layers as the story and relationship progress. Secrets are kept, trust is tested.<br /><br />As the story progresses, the plot line will lead us in ways that were unforeseen. Even with the mild foreshadowing that the author sneaks in to keep our interest piqued. This is not a world just thrown together to produce a story. This is a story steeped in musty history and rich facts that brings every intricate detail into sharp focus. Every world flows together with purpose. The romance is so pure that it lends a sweeter taste to the eeriness of the story.<br /><br />This is a new world of vampires, shapeshifters and witches that stands alone in it's own realm. This is a book that will grab your attention, refusing to let go. The eerie world that Rebecca Hamilton has created in The Forever Girl has and will keep capturing the attention of readers. And rightfully so! I was completely 100% absorbed in The Forever Girl from the first page. The story will linger, the characters will haunt until we are satisfied by reading the next book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Simple to play and control.  Sometimes the more simple the game concept, the more enjoyable the game.  Especially on a phone or tablet.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Every time I start the game it nagged me to leave a review, so here it is.  It is not a bad game, and it met me reasonable entertained for a while, but I would not have paid for this app it quickly becomes repetitive and does not require any level of thought or strategy to play.
B004FOA84A|5.0|like others said, it doesn't take long to play. took me a little over an hour. but it had several fun puzzles and nice graphics and sound. I enjoyed it and i think a dollar is cheap for over an hour of fun.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|In \\"Defending Jacob,\\" Andrew Barber is a prosecuting attorney. He has a wife he loves and a son with a lot of potential. It's just a phase with Jacob, in his teens, surly, witty, existential, sloppy, all the things that make parents crazy. But then a boy is killed near Jacob's school, not just killed, stabbed three times with a knife. Andrew is sent to the location to assist with the investigation. It takes a few days of legal wrangling before the school allows students to be questioned. The students are evasive. Finally, a tip if slipped out. . . check Facebook. See what people are saying about Jacob. Andy Barber is yanked off the case because his son is taken into custody, charged with murder. Neither of Andy's parents think the case will go anywhere. They know their son is a pain to be around, all teens can be, but the community is sure he's guilty, because after all, he has been arrested. The trial of Jacob Barber leads to some interesting discoveries about Andy Barber and his knowledge of his own family, of his wife, Laurie, and his son Jacob. The secrets families keep from one another and the invasive strength of social media are two of William Landay's themes and plot points in this riveting thriller. Four stars only because I thought the ending was heavily foreshadowed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Waste your time away, do work another day. Has the occasional ad no big deal. If you like solitaire you will like this.
B00005N6KG|5.0|What's all the belly-aching about? I've had no problems and get great stereo sound. The cord is not too short; in fact,for my use it's perfect. The ear pieces fit snugly and the headband is comfortable. I'm buying a spare because, eventually, all headphones--that's all headphones--develop a problem. And at this price, it's a steal. Go for it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|even more addicting than where's my water!! :) I love love love love love love Love love love love love going buts! its  amazing!!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I expected a simple Mahjongg game.  Instead I got a confusing interface when I started the app.  After about 5 minutes of trying to play it, I uninstalled the game.  I would not pay ANY sum of money for this game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun take on mahjong. I don't think I will grow bored of this game any time soon. Definitely worth full price.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This review is for [[ASIN:B000O8OTNC Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener]]. Smith's knife sharpening tools have been used in my family for many years. My favorite sharpener is their Arkansas Tri-Hone system I have had and used for more than 15 years. This little pocket-sized sharpener is a decent tool for when you need to put a quick edge on a pocket knife or skinner. For me, its real strength comes into play when I need to sharpen the serrations on one of my combination blades. The tapered sharpening steel works quite well to put a good edge on the cutting surfaces of a serrated blade.<br /><br />I would not want to have to use this to hone a really dull blade but for most cases where you want to fine up an edge this little tool is the right choice.<br /><br />Its compact size makes it convenient to carry in a pocket, pouch or go bag. It is sturdy and very unlikely to suffer damage if it gets tossed into a tool bag or tackle box and it is small and light enough to carry along on an extended hike.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I downloaded this game today. I didn't have any problems with ads. I also haven't had any issues running on the fire so far.
