B0068AWQQ2|5.0|Funny and pays appropriate homage to the original, while becoming it's own. David Tennant is a gift. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is underused, but comes away with the best line in the movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have given several months to reflect on my lasting impressions of this book, having enjoyed it as a 'beach read.'  The read was quick, action packed, and oriented well to who I suspect is the target market (as if this statement was not obvious by the sales numbers).  The book raises eyebrows among its target readers, without dropping unexpected erotica in their laps.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't feel that I knew much about the protagonist to follow her emotions in entering this new lifestyle.  I couldn't parse fee or apprehension of excitement, but I don't think that was the intention.  It may well be that the characters are further developed in follow-on works, which is a great technique in a series.<br /><br />If I could offer anything to improve the writing, it would be to word count certain commonly-used verbs and adjectives, and replace some for more effect.  The character behaviors can be visualized just as well - or better - by describing them in more ways.<br /><br />Congratulations on your work in writing this and in its well-earned rewards.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great ending, I can't wait for the final book to see how the capitol is brought down.  I could not put this book down till the end.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful stories within a book. This was different from his other 2 books, but I loved it. It was a very emotional book.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It's not that bad of an app but sometime it won't work then you have to turn off your kindle to use it again ( not all the times). It won't play any vevo. It will let you download music and it will save the music to your videos app you get with kindle since the music is in a form of video so that's a good pro
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It took me one or two episodes to get into it, but now I'm hooked!  Can't wait for season four :)
B00CXAAG6I|2.0|love cats, this was not my type of book sorry. A lot more could have been done with this book Thanks
B0021L8UPS|3.0|My brother recommended that I see this movie.  So I used my Amazon Prime access and watched it because RedBox in my area didn't carry the movie. The cons are it's not scary, the movie seems to drag on and it's fairly predictable. Despite these cons, I simply could not stop watching it. I was very intrigued by the 9 year old orphan. She was so unusual for a little girl yet there is something eerie and mysterious about her. Now I know I said the movie is predictable and for the most part this is true. I figured out the ending before it was revealed but that didn't stop me from being totally surprised by it. I only guessed the ending because I know someone who has a daughter with the same problem. Though she's nothing like the orphan in the movie. Any way, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. I'm giving it a 3 rating because of the cons I previously mentioned.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It keeps me entertained the whole time very fun no bugs runs great fun for all ages works and fun
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is a great app, both my son and I have it you can play each other or work on moving up in through the ranks.  Funny and addicting.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|Arrived as described and works flawlessly.  Quality is very durable and the adhesive on the back in strong.  Like the different color options.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|The preview made this movie look pretty funny.. but you know how when they pull ALL the funny scenes and put it into the preview? Bingo! I laughed maybe once. It was so mind numbingly boring. I hoped that this movie would be a bit like Office Space. It's not. How did this make it into the comedy genre?! Maybe teens are the ones who gave it a good rating.  Save your money (and your brain cells)- look for something else.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I just got this game two days ago and it is cool.  I knew it be fun after seeing the game's advertising image.  The notifications help you keep the town growing.  Also, the game can process a lot and lets you have a good time when all is said and done.
B0030SZ2D4|5.0|What a great start for a movie with a incredible crew that went on to have great careers. Love this firdt movie, my boys wanted to see the start of ridick, loved it all over again
B007704HO6|5.0|A very nice story about a cat and a man. They both needed help and they helped each other. As a person who has a cat, or maybe my cat has me, this story is very emotional and real because I think that we can have very good realationship with animals. Towerd the end of the book I was not sure if the cat was treated fairly, what I mean is if the owner did not use the cat to his adventage.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series was one of the few that my wife and I went into thinking 'we're not going to enjoy this' and changing our minds completely.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My grandson love the movie and I also enjoy it.  I just wish it was the DVD in the flesh and he could travel with it, to the lake and other places that he goes and spend the night.  When we are here at home, we can go to the movies anytime at the library at Amazon.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Hours of entertainment. Fortunately I have more than one tablet along with my phone because my son is always fighting me to play this game. Graphics are 10 times better than past shark games.
B00000163G|5.0|I purchased this as a wedding gift for the groom, the wedding is not until 9/14/2013, he listened to my All Eyez on Me that I previously ordered and has begged for CD as every time he see me, he is asking for it. The CD is very good music and music that can stand the times.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I usually prefer Stephen King short stories, but this book is most interesting.  A great story line.  I hated to stop reading for moment.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|My kids have seen it a few times and it is always a big hit! Good for adults, as well
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was so much fun to read.  So unique.  Thank you Robin Sloan for another favorite book  to add to my list!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|For Leo, it was very anti climatic..  And a bit like, huh?  I was expecting better..  I'm pretty tuff on movies tho..
B0089EHWQE|5.0|excellent book- know many people who are handicapped in one way or another and it was a beautiful tribute to the girl who was so caring of her friend who started out as her patient
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I bought this pool at the beginning of LAST summer and expected it to last a month, at the most.  At the end of its second summer, it is still doing just fine... I have a 3.5 yr old and a 1.5 yr old... It is not very deep which (6-8 inches) is is a great safety feature for this age group.  They both jump all over it, and both use the slide all day, almost every day during the summer.  My 3 yr old actually jumps from the top part of the slide, bounces off the middle and then lands on the inflatable pad... That is his signature move, and it seems very abusive to the poor pool... But, beside a very slow leak (takes about 4 hours to notice visually - but no effect otherwise) on the outside somewhere, the pool is still going strong.  I will probably buy another one for next year because I can't find the leak and in case it gets worse over the winter, I don't want to go a summer without it... Nor do my kids!  I should also add that it sat in our way below freezing garage all winter on my husbands work bench and it hung in there.<br /><br />I definitely recommend an air pump.  I would never use it without that... It takes about 5 minutes to inflate the whole thing.  FYI, there are several different air chambers to inflate so make sure the air pump you buy has the small attachment... I bought the Coleman pump for about $15... And the pool is only $35... A great gift for anyone with small children... I would say under 5yrs.  Anyway, solid purchase!  Especially for the price!  get one!<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the slow leak... But even with that being said, it surpassed my expectations for sure!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my 4 month old as he had trouble maneuvering his regular pacifier.<br /><br />I am quite impressed at how well made the overall product is made. The monkey is soft and with beans in the hands and feet. The pacifier, which is a Soothie, the same kind they give you in hospitals, is very securely attached. I've tugged on it and have no concerns about it coming off.<br /><br />As I it comes with a Soothie, which is Monkey's favourite, he took to it right away. There was a slight learning curve in getting him used to it, but he quickly got the hang of it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The cinematic beauty of this production is breath-taking and the visual feast transports you into another time.  Great quality is replicated in each scene, with creditable actors creating memorable characters you care about.  I find I want to stand-up and applaud each episode, as if I was in the theatre or in the great room of Downton Abbey!
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|This game is a fun and intriguing type. It has maps with with a start point and an end point. You use windmill fans to keep the balloon crafts moving forward and sometimes upward over objects. If you like puzzles, this is the game for you. The point is to get all your balloons safely to the endpoint. This game is fun to plan and watch as you balloon through the maps.<br />I gave this a four star due to some people might become a little bored with this app. I didn't. It is and enjoyable game to sit back and play. Worth the purchase.
B0058SN2C2|5.0|I originally bought these for work. I needed a black dressy shoe that was also comfortable when standing on my feet for long periods of time. They don't look like typical Crocs and fit the foot very snug. I've started to wear them at the beach and in the water at Lake Michigan where it's rocky, they are perfect for that too. They are also very durable and easy to clean.
B000002KNY|4.0|Ground breaking and well constructed songs with artfully smart lyrics.<br />You can never go wrong with the talking heads! Great album, great price!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Biographies tend to be hard reads for me, but Goodwin really knows how to pen history to draw the reader in.  This book was hard to put down until I was finished.  My only issue was that it ended a lot sooner than I expected.  That was because the Kindle version showed it to be slightly above 50% done when I reached the end of the text -- because it counts the research notes at the end which I wasn't expecting.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|I'm at the point where if I can't get a blu-ray with an Apple \\"Digital Copy\\" option, I'll just order the digital copy from Apple and forego the disc. I'm tired of the studios insisting on Ultra Violet.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I've enjoyed these guys ever since I stumbled upon their videos on Youtube. Thank you so much, gentlemen, for putting together the videos, for playing the music, and for loving it all so much!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|once started I had to keep reading and within a short time I had all three books read. Perhaps the 3rd book had a lot of repetition but I still enjoyed reading
B00CJGP116|5.0|Long awaited and not disappointed. The more I listen to all the cuts on this cd, the more I love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great mind picker. kept me busy. love the rooms and different themes&hellip;level ten was the hardest. I don't know what else to say it was great
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Solidly grounded in historical accuracy, Follett weaves together several parallel stories that present a fascinating account of the period before and during World War I.

B00DP94Z2W|5.0|Newsted rocks! He sure knows Metal and this album brings just what the title states. Heavy Metal Music is too cool for school. Check it out if you dig this style of music.
B001B6EAOY|3.0|bulky = may not fit properly in a device because it's too thick or wide.  still functions but might get stuck.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I got this movie series because my wife wanted it.  She has a Kindle but doesn't have Prime nor HD.  So I lent her mine.  She says this series is great.  I believe it....she's glued to my Kindle everytime I see her anymore.  But, it gives me great pleasure to see her happy.  By the way, I had seen some shows on Downton Abbey and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  As for the series on Kindle...they're coming in great.  It gives Nancy time for rest from her workday.  For that, I am grateful.  Thanks Amazon.  Great idea!
B00CJGP116|4.0|I flipped a coin before buying this CD and I'm glad I won. Marc Anthony, two thumbs up. Great job.
1609611543|5.0|The information Dr. Davis shared in this book is absolutely the best.  Incredible.  All of America should read this and get their health back.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wish there were more levels! I love these types of games but sometimes they get too hard for me far too quickly. This game has more of a gradual learning curve without making you feel like you went from easy to expert like some of the other games do. Can't wait for more!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever you are totally hooked by chapter 3 perfect book for 10 and up I am12 and loved it has a twist of mystery love suspense and action
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Well, this movie has lots of action scenes for sure, but I personally think the story of the movie is less interesting. For those people who love to enjoy fighting and killing will be fine.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book along with the other two Fifty Shades books! It is not only an interesting read, but a beautiful love story! I could not put it down the entire time. I finished this book in two days!
B00COGY2P2|5.0|It was suspenseful, well done.  Tom Cruise gets an A+ for another successful movie with action, surprises and good acting.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My four year old son loves this movie. He also loves angry birds, and the fact that they have anger bird bonus features In the DVD helps out a lot. The movie is a really cute movie as well. I enjoy watching it over and over again.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I loved all seasons of Lost.  Was fun re-watching them all and seeing episodes I missed.<br />My favs were Jack, Sawyer, and John.....got more exciting as we started to put some things together.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Season Two. It is my favorite. Trust me, when you finish two, just stop it there, or just watch the 1st episode of Season 3, but then stop. Season 3 is terrible.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I don't write film content reviews as a rule because it really is a matter of taste. This case is a little different as it is based on a Dirk Pitt novel. The operative word is based so I disagree with those that would attack it from that perspective. As a B grade novel the story works but I don't think so for film because of time limitations and pace. The screen writers in my opinion did a spectacular job with this. The action flows and flows with comic relief still managing to utilize most of the key elements of the novel. The casting was also great though that too would not really match the characters of the novel franchise. The reason for a late time review is I have had the movie for years but only recently read the book. It's too bad in my opinion that the novels were not made as a trilogy movie franchise and the basic characters played by these actors would have been just fine.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I personally really enjoyed this next chapter in the GI Joe franchise as did my kids. Although it is somewhat of a violent film, it is something I expect from the elite force knows as the Joe's and their enemies, Cobra. If any parents are wondering if this film would be ok for their kids, I found it to be alright for mine, a nine year old boy and a six year old girl. Be advised though, there are enough scene's that allow for the goggling of an attractive woman and enough killing that could disturb the younger crowd. Although there are no nude scene's or gore, the imagination can fill in the rest. If you are looking for a good action flick with a pretty solid story, GI Joe: Retaliation should be a good fit.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|THIS  is AN EYE OPENING STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT our soldiers ARE UP AGAINST.  LET OUR GUYS NOT HAVE TO SECOND GUESS THEIR SITUATIONS .  Kill those al Qiada sons o bitches without worrying about lawyers .  First thing we do is kill the lawyers!!!!  LONE SURVIVOR IS A SCARY, TEAR JERKING STORY THAT IS REALLY WONDERFUL.  I THINK EVERY CONGRESSMAN AND SENATOR SHOULD READ IT.  ALL AMERICANS SHOULD READ IT SO THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Just as advertised  my wife is a Victorian style movie connoisseur (sp) and she loves this series!!!<br /><br />Thank you for a great Amazon experience...
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|A great video, esp. for the older generation. Have passed it along to others who loved it. Now own two copies!

B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I love this game and it is so much fun I will tell people about this game so they will download it.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|DWAYNE JOHNSON has always lived up to his expectations of giving us a great action-pack entertainment. FASTER is one of those great thrill rides of MR. JOHNSON delivering a riveting performance of a wounded man. He prepares to take vengeance on the killers of his brother and one thing is for sure that whoever is on his hit list, oh man they're dead. Also you shouldn't miss his other action thriller FAST FIVE starring VIN DIESEL. In this movie he plays the furious cop hunting down the fast DIESEL and once they come face to face, IT'S ONE HARD-HITTING PUNCH AFTER ANOTHER!!!
B003297I1U|5.0|Item arrived in perfect shape.  My grandson loves the crane as much as I thought he would.  So happy I made the purchase for his fourth birthday.
B000SJDW3A|5.0|This item excedded my expectations. Little to no play on vinyl. In prestine condition. Album cover and sleeve had no damage what so ever. Would highly recommend buying from the same user again to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|can't connect. I don't have internet connection in my house, but I have a hotspot in my phone. I use this hotspot if I go internet anywhere. I tried it hook with this chromecast but to no avail.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is super fun I love it. I love  all the  dragons. This game is fun!!!!! I do believe you SHOULD  get this game it's so worth it!!!!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I hate show tunes, but love this show! I think it's greatest strength is it's cast, even when the writing is a little choppy they still can make you care about them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is an awesome game for people who like to play games that never  I'm  ten and I'm automatically a lovar of minecraft and people BUY THIS GAME
1586210661|4.0|I passed this on..liked it almost as much as his &#34;Owls&#34;.  I purchased a used copy which was in perfect shape...and recycled it to another friend when I finished it.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This is a great descriptive realistic view of what a heroin addict deals with. Recovering addicts beware- if you're early in your recovery do not read this book! There's certain decriptors used that would make a newly sober addict want to use again. It describes the downfall of heroin but also the amazing feeling it gives you and the love affair the addict has with black better known as heroin. A good read.
145210655X|4.0|Hilarious, quirky, fun read.  It is a quick pick-me-up if you are in need of having a laugh.  My entire family is a fan of Star Wars.  My 10 year old son read it to us and we were all laughing out loud; it put a permanent grin on my face.  It was hysterical to see the father-son duo of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker in many of the classic \\"Star Wars\\" moments turned into your typical everyday parenting moments.  Some of my favorite scenes were: little Luke using the force to raid the cookie jar, Vader trying to use mind tricks on Luke at the store \\"this isn't the toy you're looking for\\" and failing, telling his son \\"I find your lack of patience disturbing\\", and the infamous kid question while traveling \\"are we there yet?\\"  I could just imagine the heavy breathing of Darth Vader in the delivery of his lines.  Dad Vader...too funny.
B004D23BRU|3.0|I accessed to show my grand kids,  it was to dark and intense for them.  The hunters were the good guys when I was growing up, not in this version.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very cool had allot of fun great sand che<br />ap what a great inventor he needs a Bj for this and I need a beer
0375869026|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books I have read over the years.<br /><br />I loved it and so do others I recommended it to.
B005544V6A|5.0|The chemistry between these 2 men are amazing! I absolutely love this show. The entire cast just works and really pulls you into the story. The acting is just simply believable.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|One of Matthews best performance's in a long time. Why does he do so many sub par, poorly written movies?
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|If you like Tetris, or played Tetris 20 or so years ago, I imagine you will like this derivative of the classic game - especially the \\"survival\\" mode which has timed levels and is very fast-paced.  There's not much on the instruction level, but you should be able to figure it out fairly quickly, and this can become a very addictive game.<br /><br />About the only drawback I have is it is a battery hog and will drain the battery on your Kindle Fire pretty quick.<br /><br />I originally picked this up for free during the Free App of the Day promotion and, as I type this review, I see the pricing has reverted back to $1.99: if you liked Tetris, or are looking for an addictive game, I think it will be $1.99 well spent.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Each season adds more drama and intrigue. This year they've gone broke, almost lost the house, fought over control of the house, introduced much anger and now even revealed a gay character trying to kiss a straight guy. Well written and the new actors always add. Shirley Maclaine was excellent!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Love that this has two ports on it- one for Apple products and the other for Android products (you can interchange them but the power supply to each is marginally different)
1400095204|5.0|I am now going to check out this authors other  books. The story was engrossing. You got to know, and care about the characters.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Does just about everything. It is almost like an office program. The interface is slick and the app is fast and does it all.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book!  Great story about the life of a special human being!  Would recommend this book to anyone wanting a heart felt read!
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I grabbed this cool little game for free on the Amazon Free app for the day and I like it a lot. Would not have been mad if I paid for it. The graphics and the game play are top notch.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|My wife and I loved the series.  We are hooked and looking forward to catching more episodes.  Quality of the amazon downloads are great and I look forward to them adding more shows.
B002OKO1GI|4.0|I rented this movie because my grandchildren ages 5 & 7 wanted to watch a funny movie about animals. However, there were parts showing a child being bulled and dogs being mistreated that made it uncomfortable to watch with them.
034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love these books!! A little bit naughty, a whole lot romantic! Draws me right into the heart and soul of the characters until I almost feel a part of them. These may be my favorite books ever!
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Good great grand wonderful! Good show, lots of twists and turns. Pretty sure if you watched other seasons you will enjoy
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This seemed like a basic game, and it is.  I find myself playing it when I'm waiting for a flight or listening to a mind numbing conference call.  I've seen new levels and vehicles recently and hope they continue to release more over time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Historical account of Jesus's life and death and the beginning of Christianity .it is book everyone should read and think about
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|title of review sez it all - this is \\"The Album of the Year\\" - just absolutely awesome. Kenny and Stephen at their best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you love minecraft you should buy this app. It's the best!!! By the way it's the third best selling game in 2 countries. So buy it. I got this last year and I still love it. I play it everyday.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've always enjoyed using SwiftKey and the new update does not fail to disappoint. The new flow feature is extremely intuitive, and word prediction is flawless as ever. Best of all, the app is FREE today!
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I FREAKING LOVE THIS BOOK AND THE WHOLE SERIES!!!!!!! I love the adventure, humor, and characters. Everything I this book... I love with all my heart!
0399255370|5.0|As entertaining for the (adult) reader as it is for the listener! FUN! It is a good read aloud book for grandmas and grandpas.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game so much its a really good puzzle game i love it! Hope there wil be more levels extremely soon hope to see more cool games later on
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Cassandra captivates your imagination, with clever twists and turns. I could not put the book down!  Cannot wait to read the rest of the series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Super fun game that is colorful and easy. Probably the only game where the leprechaun actually gets the pot of gold. I enjoy this game, as does my 11year old son. Great job on graphics!!!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I purchased and read up to mid-way through the 3rd book of the series in the hope that a decent story line would improve - but it didn't.<br /><br />The book (and series) is too \\"juvenile\\" is the best way I can describe my experience. I was left with the impression that the author might be the same age as the main character - 14 years old. The main character starts as a 14 year old and the entire first 3 books seem to cover probably about 1 - 2 months tops in his life. He is continually thrown into life and death situations and emerges as a great hero from each. The so called training he receives in the \\"Legion\\" seems to involve throwing untrained boys of 14 - 19 years into life and death situations to see whether they survive and somehow become better \\"warriors\\" from the experience. One minute wooden swords are being used, the next real weapons are being thrown at him with only a shield to stop serious injury or death.<br /><br />If these three books are representative of the authors other works then I won't be wasting my money.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star rating was because underneath the rubbish there is a potentially good story line. But I really couldn't stomach the thought of buying anymore of the series or even finishing the third book. The three I read are in serious need of a major re-write - it is a shame the author doesn't use the services of a decent editor (well, I assumed from the contents he didn't!).
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is such a good game .and it's a challenge for me a hard challenge for everybody for my all my family .and I'm just doing this so I can get some
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This memoir allows the reader to experience the daily prison life as experienced by  an upper-class, well educated woman in her pre-middle age years.  For those who are of the opinion that all who break the law should be sent away to prison this is a gripping story that may alter and challenge your thinking on incarceration.  &#34;Does the crime fit the punishment?&#34;  will be a question that you will be left to ponder at the completion of your reading this story of a woman sent to prison.
B0054YH7DA|5.0|As an avid Ozzie fan how can you go wrong with a classic. It lived up to all expectations as usual.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie contained a lot of sequence-shots, landscaping, and storyline. I love the breakaway from the normal routine of Sci-Fi action movies, and this one had such a great story I'd put it up as a Sci-Fi Chick Flick, with plenty of explosions and Tom Cruise shooting things. Great movie if you want something with more than explosions and weak plot points.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|An engaging summary of known facts told in a clear and understandable way. Some may quibble but the essence of the material presented rings true. It separates fantasy driven story telling from believable reality.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|If you want a fun alternative to Candy Crush Saga, then this is your game.  Very addictive and the 1 minute games make even more interesting.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I LOVE this show!!! I think this is by far one of the best shows on TV today, it has something for everyone.
0345803493|5.0|These books were terrific.  Very interesting and somewhat complex storyline.  I fell in love with the leading characters.  Terrific writing
1490313370|4.0|I stumbled upon James Altucher just this year. I was led to him by a 'casual' stock market blog and by my own reinvigorated interest in picking equities. However, what I picked up from James's mailing list is far more important than stock tips and investment coaching. He had solid, actionable advise on entrepreneurship, recovering from failure, improving oneself, working on something that you love...<br /><br />This book seems to be a re-hash blogposts (most are still available on his site), but it is re-fitted into a coherent \\"Choose Yourself\\" theme. \\"Choose Yourself\\" has a broad meaning--ranging from improving oneself and finding what makes you happy to expanding influence and improving relationships.<br /><br />But, even if there is one enveloping theme, each section can still be digested as short essays. His essay on Woody Allen is solid, the one simple daily practice is also brilliant for being actionable (not just empty platitudes or vacuous aphorisms a la Tuesdays with Morrie). I also liked how Altucher seems to balance personal experience with his examples using Gandhi, Woody Allen, and even digressions on Madoff. It's not all I did this, I did that, I thought this, I thought that.<br /><br />In Altucher's blog (you must also subscribe in his mailing list), I liked his posts with short, terse sentences, which can be consumed inside 10 minutes. The style somehow presents an hones, in-your-face approach, This book has sections with longer sentences and paragraphs, probably helped by an editor, so as not to tire the reader with machine-gun periods. I also agree with this retrofitting (if indeed there is something done).<br /><br />If youre on the fence, I suggest you browse through at least 3 essays (many are not more than 3 pages). If you liked the 'coaching' or probably became entertained with anecdotes/adventures (even if you dont take the coaching), then buy.  And read!
B006LSZECO|3.0|First want to say that I could have done without the F-bomb so often. Just not necessary. The book started out confusing and slow for me. Once it picked up I was intrigued with the possibilities of where it was going only to be totally let down with the ending. I really hate that I actually purchased this book, I've enjoyed so many more that were free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best free app game so far. Great graphics and game play. You have to run over the competion that's despicable. I recommend this game to every one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game brings back, very happy memories of being sprawled out on the rug in front of the fire at my Grandma's - I couldnt understand everyone's current obsession with candy crush & then I downloaded this on my phone, and then my new kindle ! Whoops, the dust is settling + the ironing pile rising ! Just one game, oh ok then just one more + then another !
0425252868|3.0|I understand the attraction of this story; it's a compelling human interest & war story. I also understand the reviewers here who were offended by the author's apologist attitude about the German pilots and their roles waging a war on behalf of genocidal fascists. I won't address those issues; others here have spoken well enough on them. My three stars are for the overall work as a piece of nonfiction (I use this term somewhat loosely, what with all the invented dialogue, thoughts, and facial expressions). Although my interest waned from time-to-time, I finished it and found it reasonably satisfying and interesting. But it did have the feel of a Reader's Digest piece. So--not a 5star, not a 1 star book.<br /><br />Something that was really off-putting to me, and almost made me take it back to the library early, was the incorrect use of certain words. There were two authors for this, and, I presume, an editor, yet we find: a plane orbiting \\"over\\" a place; another traversing \\"around\\" a place; \\"past\\" being used for \\"passed\\"; and a horse \\"whining\\" instead of whinnying. I distrust an author's work when I find such mistakes, and I have trouble fully connecting with a story. Perhaps I am too fussy.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Monkeys are the best ever...I love anything Monkey. This game is so great because it takes absolutely no skill...just tap the screen as fast as you can and you arbitrarely knock another ridiculously dressed Monkey on his assetts...I got this for free, which is great, because if I bought it I would certainly need to invest in industrial strength razor blades to slit my wrists all the way up to my shoulders...Go Monkeys!!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Well worth it!  Amazon had the best price of all the major retailers and they packaged the product very well so that when it arrived there wasn't any wear and tear on the case and the disks stay secure.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|This book is different from anything I've ever read. Very interesting I definitely enjoyed it and will read more books by Chuck
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Loved seasons 1-4. I see season 5 is available, but not on &#34;Prime&#34; Hope this changes with the upcoming 1 year anniversary September 11th.  Can't wait!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|As long as you have a loud song it eagles you up easily not to mention it can play your songs for as long as you want.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have really enjoyed \\"Can You Escape\\".  Looking forward to more floors<br /> being available.  It is not extremely hard but it is challenging.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old nephew who loves both Minecraft and Lego, he was delighted opened it immediately and started building it.  Before I knew it, it was built - It is a small set and has lots of small parts.  All i know is he was thrilled.  I usually buy Creator 3 in 1 sets which he gets a lot out of but i wanted to get something different.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I LOVED this series!!!  I absolutely get lost in this exceptionally well done story.  So looking forward to the new adventure when it begins!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 9 years old daughter loves ice age she thinks this game is better then her Wii! I never thought she would rather play this then her Wii! Also we love playing it together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good way to waste time on a rainy day! It's fun and doesn't take too much brain power to get to the next floor.
1402793375|5.0|A beautifully presented book including incredible factual detail and history that simply astounds! Fabulous illustrations including reproductions of many original portarits and scene paintings.
B00280LYIC|1.0|This book maybe it's good, because I've been reading some REALLY good written books lately or maybe I'm right about it sucking so much! Like really, one chapter is titled 'We capture a flag' or another 'I destroy a perfectly good bus' the most stupid book in the universe do not buy it!!!!!!!!!!! Please, I do not want you to waste your money on this garbage!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|addicted! Can't wait for the next season! That last episode is So sad and yet leaves you wanting more and more...
B007THA4FI|3.0|The style of this story is very different from the well liked Harry Potter series and difficult to relate to any single character. Almost seems like another version of &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34; with all the swearing, coarse language, and criticisms. As usual, the kids are<br />paying the price while they are rebelling. Learned a bit about british slang. Probably leaves most appreciating what they have.
1878424319|4.0|This was a nice fast read with good advice! I think the author simplified the &#34;4 Agreements&#34; which are easy in theory but will be harder in action.<br />I think it's great for a person who's &#34;healthy enough&#34; to absorb it. It seems trusting that you have what it takes to be able to distinguish the difference between &#34;your reality&#34; and what the Four Agreements is saying. I saw the author on Oprah and enjoyed the interview. Good advice in a few pages.
B000NMW6M0|1.0|The movie title is an apt analogy for a failed communication between producer and audience... I get the point, but the whole thing is contrived and pretentious. I wouldn't want to hang out with the crowd of sanctimonious blowhards who call this mess &#34;one of the best films of 2006&#34;. What a waste of time.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Worth a read. Goes fast. I'd liked the first book better. Great world, too bad the characters aren't more realistic.
B007EC27QM|2.0|Haven't been able to get it to work yet. Please send directions to an easy to find place so I can get this to work
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Very interesting topic: retrospective of the not-so-distant tragedy of Biafra, another decolonization tragedy.<br />As for the writing itself, amazing author! I love the way she moves from tenderness to crudeness, and the sunny overall African tone impregnating the whole story.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Haven't been able to get it to work yet. Need directions in easy to find place. Please send more information
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The whole of Downton Abbey, seasons one and two at this point, altho I've critiqued three. . . are a dramatic experience not to be missed. Julian Fellowes is a master at character development and dialogue. I feel as though the Crawley family and the whole staff are part of my family, to visit and revisit, time and again. I can only hope that this series goes well beyond season four.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is fun and informative with a way to stay in touch with friends you just don't see any more.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I've got every record ever put out by Elvis, and, wanted this one, too. People don't know it, but, Elvis did a lot of Hank William's songs.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it! I can bring my books with me even when I can't bring my kindle! I use it the most when I am waiting in lines.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I watched the whole series. Season 7 was by far my favorite. They tied up all the story lines very well.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I can't get enough of this show!  I can't wait to see the new season.  One of the best shows out there!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive game but also helps use your brain. Only complaint is having to buy crystals in the game but that is the way all games are these days
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game! I love the intensity that it can bring, and it's also a fun game for young kids! Making it a bonus buy for a family!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  I can see why the Star Trek purist were all up in arms about it.  JJ Abrams definitely took a fundamental story line from the original movies and changed it.  However, it was entertaining action packed (they wait no time to start the action) and worth 2 hours of my time.  See it you'll enjoy it, unless you're unwilling to let go of the past and realize that its not a remake of the old movie.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This film was expertly acted, edited, written, directed, and art directed. It's a suspenseful coming of age tale. I look forward to more work by the young actors. You can read the plot in the movie description. I won't go into that here. If what's described here and there appeals to you, then you'll enjoy it.
B00CTT9646|2.0|I pre-ordered this the day it was available, but I just cancelled it due to the extreme lack of extra features. I don't like being forced to buy 3+ copies of the same movie to get all of the features, therefore I'll either wait for the \\"ultimate\\" release with all of the bogus retailer exclusives they're doing now, or I'll go without.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with retailer exclusives such as the phaser here, the steelbook and ship at walmart, etc. but when the quality of the actual movie release is diminished by making parts of the disc exclusive to one retailer or another, then I have an issue and that is what cost this film my purchase.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|it is relaxing if you are not trying to beat a time. I just play and not worry about time
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Very Useful. Downloaded it. Used it with no problems. Glad to be able to read PDF's on the go. Would recommend.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Now this one here I love because it happens to be an all purpose watch. And I do mean ALL PURPOSE! You can wear it to work... to the club... and definitely when you are trying to impress that LADY to achieve even other things (I won't speak of... G Rated, right? LOL). Just look at the design...PERFECT! I love it!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|a pretty good cd from Blake. I really like him on The Voice and heard the song Redneck ad liked it. Listened<br />to the reviews of each song and thought it would be good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for all ages. Lots of fun and amazing graphics and animation. Would highly recomend. Just wish i didnt have to spend real money for more energy.
B0000047CW|5.0|And Charlie Byrd \\"getz\\" overpowered at times, but they click. You don't have to love samba or bossa nova to love this album. Byrd's quiet style makes you listen and rewards the effort.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Great prose and writing style. I enjoyed the storyline as well as learning about different places in Nigeria. I've already learned how to make pepper pot soup! Makes me want to visit Nigeria!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My boyfriend and I have competitions on this game to see who can get the highest cumulative score.  I was playing it on my phone but it was too small.. I downloaded it onto my kindle fire and..well lets just say..he isn't kicking my butt anymore. :-)
0765367351|2.0|The prequel to Bioshock was a dramatic disappointment to me. Bioshock and its sequels had 5 star stories but this prequel almost completely fails to have a plot of its own. The majority of it is simply a little context for the audio diaries found throughout the Bioshock games. But the added context does little to nothing to aid the experience. The first 300 pages are horribly boring and the next hundred make little improvement. I'd like to say that this is a fantastic novel about the anarchist couph(tea party) ideals can destroy a society but that is part of the game so it is made redundant.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show! The characters are fantastic, story lines are interesting, and it's smart, funny , plus it has the cool factor.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|JJ Abrams once said this send-up was the best Star Trek movie ever. Doesn't that tell you all you need to know?
0793573742|5.0|This is an awesome book if you're into the 'Bursts, the holy grail of Les Pauls. Great pictures. This book just makes you want one even more.
0061743526|5.0|Librarians voted &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; the best American novel written in the 20th century, and this edition is a lovely reproduction of the original release.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Creative storytelling keeps the reader wondering what will happen next...and it's always something you would have never guessed! I recommend this book.
0857687751|5.0|love this book!  would suggest to any potterhead!  So much I didn't know about the books and movies  until now.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Good collection of songs and variety in style.  My wife and I enjoy his voice and his singing ability.  His voice is really versatile
B008602KQI|3.0|The premise is absurd. It ignores the truth about human psychology. Violence over indignation could not be quelled by a game.<br />As a fantasy violence flick the two heroins could have been pitted against each other and in the end they defiantly refuse to play the game because the love each other. Re-write.
140006922X|5.0|Very interesting look at the life of Jesus, it did not shake my belief but only served to strengthen it. Jesus is a more complex person than some would like us to believe.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|such an excellent read :) well written and interesting for both men and women. It's great for management advice as well. My boyfriend is a manager of an engineering team and he liked it a lot too.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|The collection is great!  Been enjoying revisiting the island via Blu-ray and loving it.  Lots of fun extra footage to watch too.
B002ZG980U|5.0|with age, the more you watch it the better it gets... Nicely done, maybe a hole or 2 in the story with possibly a question or more not completely answered but the concept is out of this world.
B00BATWJFE|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. It was funny and hopeful and a nice break from the reality of life. I think you are rooting for Rosie and Don from the moment they meet. It is also funny to see how Don wants a wife who will fit his questionnaire... something that Rosie definitely doesn't. and in the end it is the surprises that make us happy. I would recommend.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|I am missing Heath Ledger all the time. He was a great actor, and he took the role of the Joker to a whole other level. His performance is really what made this movie fantastic.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Heard Imus talking about it and bought it for myself - it was everything and more.  I'd recommend it to anyone who grew up with this band.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the screen - so crisp and clear.  The processing time for web browsing and email viewing is awesome and the apps work much better than other tablets I've worked on.  I would highly recommend.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Good use of brain power when looking for something to do, more challenging certainly than Bingo or Slots, when you want more than just playful.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|I can perform the same action many times and get many different results.  The game therefore seems to be luck-based rather than skill-based, in my opinion.  Not impressed with the gameplay.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|many of the aspects of WW2 were not know to me.  It certainlly showed each country's feeling during the war.
B008UX2UIO|4.0|Well written and entertaining.  He captures the New Orleans dialects extremely well.  I recommend it to those familiar with the city.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|This book is really a good entertainment. Sherlock's way of solving crimes is fascinating. I can only recommend the reading.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is one of those rare books that changes forever your outlook on life when you read it. It's one of those rare books that entertain you, captivate you, enthrall you, and cause you to think...all at the same time! Life of Pi is one of those books so original it forces you to raise your standards in fiction. Life of Pi reconfirmed my belief both in stories and in the power of the human spirit. It is both one of my all-time favourite books, and one of the most enduring books of the 21st Century. My highest praise is not even enough.<br /><br />But let me tell you this: it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Hearing the hype in early 2012, both for the upcoming movie adaptation and the book, I decided to read Life of Pi. I could not.<br /><br />The book seemed unbelievably dense, like something you had to read for school in 10th grade, just psychological musings, religious debates, and something thrown in about a tiger. Or a zebra or something. I gave up 10 percent through the book. Or rather eBook, since I read it on my Kindle.<br /><br />Then I saw Ang Lee's [[ASIN:B00BSBT8M6 movie]] of the same name. It was incredible, absolutely magical. Stunning cinematography and groundbreaking CGI melded seamlessly with incredible acting, heart, humour, and brilliant thought-provoking subjects such as truth and fiction, God and religion, etc to make a truly amazing cinematic event. It was deservedly a huge success at the box office, sweeping the Oscars and winning over the critics. In my original film review of Life of Pi, I gave it 5 stars, calling it \\"even better then the book.\\"<br /><br />Had I even read the entire book? No. Several weeks after I saw the film I came across the Life of Pi paperback in my local library. I checked it out, and set myself to reading it. To my surprise, the book captured me from the start. There is power in books - the smell, the touch, the grain of the paper, and the black of the ink, the heft of the paper - to read a good book in actual _book form is to enter another reality, as if holding the tome in your hands is some proof of the story's existence.<br /><br />I fell in love with Life of Pi halfway through. The color and detail, the action and drama, the heart, the humour, the compelling characters, the gritty realism, the danger, the animals, and that most relateable and singular of protagonists - Piscine Molitor Patel (named after a French swimming pool, born in Pondicherry, India, orphaned in the Pacific Ocean).<br />By the end, I was enthralled. I found the movie was only _half the story. There was so much more, and the book was so much better! The strange story of a scrawny Indian boy castaway in the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat, with a Bengal Tiger, and briefly, a Zebra, a Hyena, and an Orangutan renewed my belief in the power of fiction. Yann Martel's way with words is stunning, and the pictures he paints in your mind will stay there as if burned by a redhot brand.<br /><br />The details he uses to portray scenes of incredible magnitude, horror, awe, and beauty is unparalleled in recent years. The parables he tells are a lost form of storytelling. The realism and factualism he puts into his work must be a product of countless hours of research, but it comes across as seamless. Overwhelming is a mild way to put it.<br /><br />But what of the book's ultimate boast? Will Life of Pi make you believe in God? Probably not, though I _have heard of such testimonies. But one thing is certain. Life of Pi will make you believe in the power of books. This is a work of incalculable beauty and colour, originality and power, that, if you are more open than the average reader, will take you on an incredible journey that you never want to end. A journey of hope, overcoming fears, finding God, openmindedness, life, death, animals, man, and finding your true self, which for one resourceful Indian boy, took a little more than he expected.<br /><br />My rating? Five Richard Parkers out of Five.<br /><br />P.S. Check out the excellent [[ASIN:B00BSBT8M6 film]] of the same name. Kudos to [[ASIN:B000ICXQS8 Ang Lee]] for doing the impossible and adapting Yann's book.<br />P.P.S. Check out Yann Martel's second novel, [[ASIN:0812981545 Beatrice and Virgil: A Novel]], the divisive but brilliant story within a story about a howler monkey and a donkey on an epic adventure. Cheers!eck out the excellent [[ASIN:B00BSBT8M6 film]] of the same name. Kudos to [[ASIN:B000ICXQS8 Ang Lee]] for doing the impossible and adapting Yann's book.<br />P.P.S.

B000HL0EEE|4.0|Enterprise is the best of all the Star Trek shows, especially season 1. Subsequent seasons very good for the most part.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is a great time killer. Lots of fun and strategic. My grandson loves this game as much as I do making it a great game for a wide age range.
0743233832|5.0|This book is well written, and appears to be an excellent representation of Aurelius's thoughts. A great man who understood the struggle within each man, to master his own shortcomings and passions. This should be required reading for every young man.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun the only thing I don't like is that it has to double download but it is a very fun
B0091X76YA|4.0|It has some twists that I didn't expect. Kept me entertained thru the whole movie. I liked it enough to buy it on dvd and for my kindle.

0064471837|5.0|I picked this up years ago and I eagerly picked up the sequels and the short story collection shortly thereafter. I have read it many, many times since then and every time I enjoy it immensely.<br />I love the characters, I love Abhorsen's house and I don NOT like necromancers but I LOVE this book. It defies all these assumptions you have about what this novel could be about.<br />I love this book.<br />You will love it too.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was recommended by someone commenting on... what?  AARP?  To answer a question about what we are reading this summer.  Figured what the heck.  I was finished with what I had.  Give it try.  So glad I did!  Great story and so different from other books I've read.  And I've read a lot over the years.  Fascinating story, and definitely an attention grabber.  Hard to put down all the way though.  Now on to the next one!  Thanks!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|revelation! doing it was a bit hard in the beginning, now after couple of weeks it feels great and gives a lot of energy the fasting days and days after that. Have herbal supplements i use whcih seem to have much stronger impact on the fasting days! Feels really great!

B004HWT6DO|5.0|Aaron Sorkin writes great scripts.  This had the potential of being an overly nerdy tale, but it comes across with engaging personal stories lines punctuated with occasional pithy comeback lines.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Its a very good movie, definatly worth watching but be prepared to end it in tears, do not watch if u are depressed , its a very good heartwarming heartbreaking true story.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I thought it was a great movie and an amazing story of strength. That mother was beyond brave and I couldn't imagine going through what she did.

B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|Hard to comment without spoiling it, but it was a cheap ripoff of a previous movie or two. One of my friends absolutely loved it, but I thought it showed a real lack of originality.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoy his books<br />It's important to know how others live.  Most of us are too lucky to know sorrow of this magnitude.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|A few of these songs gets played over and over on the radio and they are good. But the songs played on the radio aren't even the best songs on this album.
006226303X|5.0|I am  a big fan of Neil Gaiman. I buy the CD's of his books,but only when HE reads them himself. He is a wonderful narrator. His books come alive. I really enjoyed this book, but I think his audio of The Graveyard Book is even better.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a great game for relaxing after a long day. Nice graphics, mini games are not complicated but still takes a little while to figure out. Story plot is ok. Nice range of characters.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love Adele !  I was going to give this as a gift , but ended up keeping it for myself !
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If the history is accurate, this work persuasively places what is known of the person of Jesus in the milieu of the time and geography. It appears to resolve many of the Biblical story conflicts.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|its pretty good  I kie it and I like playing it  it has a unique way of keeping you to want to keep playing it
B009AY04A8|5.0|Very interesting game I love mystery games. I like the stages of the game as well very entertaining to me and my son.
B009AY04A8|2.0|I got this game for free, so it was worth the price. It was a simple game and I didn't like the penalty for \\"random taps\\" or the levels with the flashlights. Overall it kept me occupied for a few hours, but I think the story line took too long.

B00471TLZS|5.0|This is one of the best!!  A definite cult favorite!  If you haven't seen this one???......Have you been hiding under a rock??  Very scary & suspenseful....love Jobeth Williams & Craig T. Nelson.  The special effects are worth the watch!!  Make a big batch of popcorn, settle down in a comfy chair & have fun watching this one!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I thought I was downloading a game instead you just invited malware on your device. Uninstalled it right away and better already.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great backpack for all my camera gear.  Keeps everything nicely organized and lots of extra space.  Love it.  Recommend it.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Do i really have to find 15 more words to say how truly forgettable this movie is? Really? 2 more. Done!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The cinematography and costumes are amazing.  First rate show and deserves an award.  I would highly recommend viewing the previous seasons before this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great graphics. Enjoyed playing the game. It was fun going in and out of different places and exploring. The different puzzles were fun to play as well. I would recommend this game.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|One of the worst movies I have seen as far as a docudrama. Waste of my time really - tried to give it a shot, but sorry I did.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|Since a young boy I have always enjoyed westerns. Sergio Leone's work using extreme close ups, tense drama and very realistic hygiene of people from that era is outstanding.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book. The story is wonderful, told in the first person, you get to really know and understand Katniss. And while she is not really the nicest person in the world, you have to admire her spunk when thrown into an impossible situation.
B00CE0BJQ8|5.0|I bought this after seeing his performance on Kelly and Michael.  The songs are great and I love his voice.  Peaceful music and some funny too.  He does drop the f-bomb a few times so if that offends you you might not like it.  I wouldn't play it around young children either.  Arrived as promised!
B006WAIUEK|3.0|LOVED Trainspotting when it came out, but this was a bit too much. Mibbe ahm jist getting old, ken likesay?
B009O07NMA|5.0|Love to jam in the car to these songs!  It is my driving home ritual.  Helps relax you when traffic is bad.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|a very interesting book if you like fantasy and science fiction.  It is my opinion that this book is suited more for<br />young teenagers not adults.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Another fun game with our bird friends.  Easy enough for kids but fun for adults who just want to &#34;veg&#34; out and have some fun.
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|Basically a day in the life of a high school student in a psych ward.... he shouldn't really be there! He meets a girl and they get together in the end. It's funny in parts but I wouldn't recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thoroughly loved the book and the premise.  The book is well and thoughtfully written.  It gave me so much to think about for my remaining days!
B001EC3JME|5.0|Real cool flashlight holder...good price..seems to hold up well..I like to wear it sideways on my belt at work so I don't bang my light off stuff as much...I like the idea that I could use the light on my belt..hands free so to speak but I will probably never use it that way lol..I clipped it in my epilate of my work shirt.tried to do a aliens space marine flashlight but it was too heavy for my shirt lol..maybe vest though...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game brings back memories of all of the horse games I played on the computer growing up. It's fun and easy to learn. It is a bit receptive in some regards but if you don't mind that then you will enjoy it. Very realistic graphics.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Thank you Dave Grohl for bringing this story to life.  Technically about some recording hardware and the studio that housed it, the real story is about the people who came there to make some very special music.  The musicians were aided and befriended by the folks running Sound City -- to the extent that it truly was a large (and sometimes dysfunctional) family.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, and you see the individuals and bands that used the unique qualities of Sound City, you realize that the studio was the birthing ground of some of the enduring themes in the genre.  Even the tech war between analog and digital recording is presented in an interesting and thought-provoking manner.<br /><br />Watching this is time well spent for anyone who enjoys music and the people who make it.
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|There are several levels.  You maneuver your tablet to roll the ball through the maze to collect the bonuses and get to the end.  If you're looking for immediate gratification, pick another game.  If you want a challenge, this is your game!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|love this movie...saw in theatres and just had to own it. I think its an educational movie for kids these days
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|The story begins with a young boy facing life without his lower leg after leaving a cut to fester, fearful of telling his mother due to the pain and cost that doctors and hospital would bring. I enjoyed Sebastian's story, his childhood, being told to expect little from life due to him being a cripple, his love for Margit and his care and concern for his family as his father leaves for the war, leaving him as the man of the family. I loved his determination and realism, aware that his leg and weaker constitution slowed him down physically but that his love of books and thirst for knowledge could be used to inspire in his work as a teacher. I would have loved the whole book to be told from his perspective and to hear more about his special relationship with his grandfather but that is just personal preference.<br />Margit's mother is a driving force through the book, inflicting her strong opinions on her daughter and encouraging her to abandon her man and daughter to follow her mother to Galicia to find her father as is Sebastian's mother Vera who, while making new friends herself, interferes and  manipulates her son's life.<br />It's a compelling, well told story of life in Vienna before WW1 where those who were friends are now ostracised because of where they were born and men in their millions lose their lives as the rich and powerful strive for more riches and more power, while the ordinary people are mere pawns in this deadly game. If you enjoy well told, historical fiction, you will love this book.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Movie was good not as good as the first one  Like the flashback to Kahn bit.  Hope next one is better
B002GAR3AM|5.0|I followed this series at a suggestion from a friend and was very happy to be able to continue this season...still watching...nice twists!!  More later!!
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I loved the book it was great. The adventures Alex and Conner went on were awesome. There were funny parts and sad parts and intense parts. I am just saying you need to get this book. And you need to get the first one if you haven't yet. These ate the best books ever. Chris Colfer is a great author.
1423140605|5.0|Rick doesnt let us down at all!  Once again he has captivated my son and I only see him for food, school and football!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Not a trekky but loved this movie.  This movie has all the Star Trek adventure and panic to save the day. The filming and scenes are awesome. Very unexpected disasters.  I love a good fight and this movie delivered with quality and action.
B000SW4DLM|5.0|A glimpse into a bleak future of poluted rainy cities, in which humanoid robots return from distant plantets to reck havoc on their creator, and a policeman must hunt them down. Also a unusual romance develops and a surprise ending. I feel most people will find it very entertaining.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Good sci-fi action movie. I love movies that make you think and figure out what's really going on. This movie is definitely entertaining and worth a bowl of popcorn to watch.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|A beautiful, loving young girl is turned into a horrific monster by a deamon that posseses her. The priests must cast out the deamon before it kills the young girl. A hair-raising story with amazing special effects. A must have, for all horror lovers.
B00CIS1OKW|4.0|Fun movie, the baking scene is a classic.  This fairytale movie remake is fun to watch.  The Giants and the seeds have a whole new viewpoint from the original.  I have watched this movie several times with family and friends.
B00AEFXZ1C|5.0|Pittsburgh woman welder dances at night in a dive with other girls. Romance develops between she and her boss. She has secret ambitions to become a toe dancer but has to be convinced to go for it. Good story, good development of plot. Good side action between her and her skating friend.
B00CPLGFM4|5.0|I used this to build a computer for a friend - a little under powered compared to a dedicated CPU but this APU concept is growing on me.  Dual core has a nasty ring to it for me as I've been operating under quad cores for the last three years, but I decided to take a gamble (with someone else's money, no less) and I have to say I'm impressed.<br /><br />It's quite a bit speedier than I would have imagined - I'm using it right now, in fact.  I've tested a few games with it and am impressed with how well it handles the graphics.  I never would have imagined since integrated GPUs have never been very favorable in terms of performance.  I may be changing my tune...  And having my friend upgrade to a higher end model so I can test that out later!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing  ! I couldn't ask for more. It's just so good! Keep up the good work moaning!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this i loved the story i loved the way they could gel together the way they did the way he thought he had control of anna but the truth was the had control of each other . Brilliant . I loved fifthy shades serious . Its easi reading i was gripped from the start again i read in 3 days .
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|PDF's are everywhere. Definitely need this app on your Kindle. Very useful, when reading email attachments. Also, like how you can use it to create your own PDF's
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I heard  good things about this book i wanted to check it out for myself . It was brilliant i could not put it down i really got into it . The story its self had me gripped from the first page i had it read in 3 days every chance i got i would read it  . You could feel the energy from both of the main characters.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is cool because it has fighting and death but you should read the Pearce Jackson series before reading this book
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed it. It's a good second book when you know there is a third. Has is own surprises but the shock of Hunger Games as worn off, so there has to be new threats.
B009POCFTG|4.0|Comedy/ Drama quirky movie with Matthew McConaughey as a contract killer! I enjoyed this quirky movie and all the oddball characters and wasn't able to predict where it was headed or how it would end!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Crashes on install on Kindle 1. WNR. Don't know what else to say but it just will not complete install and run.
0394826817|5.0|I WANTED TO HELP MY GRAND-DAUGHTER LEARN TO HAVE GOOD MANNERS.  SHE REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.  IT WAS A &#34;FUN&#34; WAY FOR HER TO GET IN THE ROUTINE OF LEARNING & USING GOOD MANNERS.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|clumsy interface and not very efficient. I've tried some of the apps but not all, and I blame Amazon for neutering what would would be a good app set for Kindle.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Depends on your tares it wasn't bad but I gave it a 4 because of the fight scenes or action but wasn't a bad movie at all
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|Reminds me of the 1989 Batman movie and the 78 Superman mixed together. I really enjoyed it and my kids did too.
B004VFN7BE|5.0|This is an old school movie I saw b4 and still loved great movie must watch drama and the mystery you're looking for
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|excellent. is a perfect game in ever. I'm play everyday. I love this game. I play everyday. I love this Unic and perfect game in ever
B004W2UBYW|4.0|No question, Steve Jobs was extremely creative and totally off the wall.  He was very much like Ford and Edison in both is creativity and his unique personality.  Having been raised on PC's and converted to Mac's it was fascinating to read the back story on all the products I have grown to love (iPod, iPad, iPhone, iMac.)  I found especially interesting his relationships with Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates.  If you have had any connection with PC's and Apple products I believe you will enjoy seeing behind the curtain on the thoughts involved in their genesis.  There are also some interesting management lessons to take away. The book is long, but not too long.  The quality of the writing I would classify as &#34;fair.&#34;  The story is interesting enough to carry itself.  This may sound strange, but for all the detail that you are taken through regarding his illness, his actual death is never mentioned; the book goes from life to eulogy.  I was not looking for the gory details, but it would have been a good way to conclude that portion of his life by knowing when he died, where he died, and who was with him.  That comment will make sense to you if you read the book. I highly recommend it.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|The movie was entertaining, however, it's purpose was to reward a very reluctant reader after completing the book. It worked.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Enjoy this game glad I purchased it!! Would recommend to anyone who enjoys hidden object game's easy to understand and play
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is a must-read for skeptics, questioners and inquirers. Dr. Alexander explains with great clarity and detail how his near-fatal illness and the experiences he had while in coma led to his vastly changed outlook on life - both this one and the next.
1416972250|5.0|Man what a book perfect fight scenes, killer twist and beyond anything glad to have finally seen 2 relationships break through and finally happen. Glad to see valentine die but i have a sneakey suspion that Jonthan is still around come on he was half greater demon.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|A very simple to use and edit. The best one I found for its price which, as I recall, was FREE!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome<br />This game is addictive. I don't want to put it down.I can't sleep at night and get up and play it.
B0083Z614S|3.0|A little slow but a good story.<br />  It was interesting how the characters learned to love each other. Nice garden.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was skeptical that I'd find the Chromecast very useful, but for $35, I thought it was worth a try. It took over a month for my order to finally ship, and now that it is here and I've had a chance to use it, I can give a confident review:<br /><br />It sucks.<br /><br />On the upside, the packaging is nice. Installation and configuration was relatively quick and easy, but that's about all that is good about it.<br /><br />I tried casting a browser tab, just some HTML and images, no video, and the lag until it actually displayed on the TV was multiple seconds. When I scroll the page, the casted version is similarly slow to respond, if it responds at all. More than once it dropped back to the splash screen for no obvious reason.<br /><br />Google's Chromecast page boasts of a growing number of apps that support Chromecast, but they only list four, the same four that they've had from the beginning.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is like a cheaper, much less useful version of the AppleTV for Android and Chrome users that doesn't work as well.
B009JZWWGC|5.0|Wonderful and warm hearted,highlighting the core of Star Trek.  And one of the best lines in Star Trek:  &#34;not in front of the Klingons&#34;.
B00555X8OA|4.0|The information in this book is incredible. So much insight into how we really make decisions, whether good or bad. Some parts seem repetitive and it can be a bit dense, but I want to read it again.
B009X1SZFO|5.0|It is awesome. ..if you buy a copy of this album. ..buy the blu ray ..kt is so clean and ambient sounding. ..as good as my sacd s of all there titles from japan...so happy...would buy from seller again..fast shipping. ..
B00AFEY354|5.0|I rented this movie not just because it stars Emma Watson (sigh! those were the days...), but also because I did the wallflower thing through junior and senior high school and beyond, and I wanted to see how well the movie captures the experience. It does, painfully well, and also a few other experiences that hit WAY too close to home. Once I'd seen Perks, of course, I had to buy the DVD. Turns out it's one of the few DVD presentations in which all the &#34;Extra Features&#34; are worth watching. Three thumbs up.
B00AYB12PC|5.0|Great Movie! Came out when my son was a baby & he, now 17 & I have been watching then all. Still good & he LOVES them!
B001NHNG64|4.0|One thing I liked about the first Jack Reacher was the first person point of view. I tend to prefer books written in the first person, and i was kind of disappointed that this one was not. Apparently the rest of the series sticks with the third person POV.<br /><br />I realize that the Reacher series is uncomplicated. The hero is perfect (verging on a Mary Sue) and his morality is unambiguous. He is not tormented, or unsure. Sometimes I want that in a light read. He is not a &#34;dark knight&#34; vigilante. He is good, and strong, and handsome, and smart, and talented. So what if it is unrealistic?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator almost daily for simple business math. It works great, easy to use. All you need is a simple desktop calculator, I highly recommend this app.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I really enjoyed it but one of the main purposes I purchased it was to learn the new abilities and how they work since I have been out of this game for a long time.  I wish there was some mode that you could choose to play with random cards to get to know the different cards and abilities in the game.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Great game for kids with super graphics. A lot of fun to play. Who doesn't like a pirate game and this one is really nice.
B004CAWSKE|5.0|I found these guys through a popular online streaming audio site.  It is a strange mixture of over the top Euro metal and lilting female voice.  But, this is a great album from start to finish, and kind of grows on you the more you listen.  Look it up and give it a try!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Wow!  How could this happen?  What a remarkable and just recognition for a tremendous talent with more than his share of humble modesty.  The music is exceptional and the words incisive.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|I got this for my wife, and it scored rather mediocre on the wife-o-meter, with very little or no crying.  It is not on Prime, and I guess is worth $1.99.  The guy looks like Tom Cruise, I mean exactly only without the couch jumping.
0743243153|5.0|Pecks three &#34;Road&#34; editions are solid, rational explanations about life.  The first seemed too much an endorsement of formal psychotherapy but nicely related case studies to points.  It did fit my spiritual journey more than subsequent editions because Peck was a Buddhist in &#34; ...Less Travelled&#34; but had returned  to Christianity by the &#34;..And Beyond&#34; edition.  I find life more peaceful when I apply Pecks ideas to what I observe in society.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Excellent book for everyone.  It change my perspective about success. I'll recommend this book to every leader, teacher, parents to help our young generation.
0684859106|3.0|Disappointed with lack of pictures in the book.  I like to be able to see how the finished product is going to look before I make it!
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|I obtained this as FAOTD. First of all I loved playing this app. Played it daily. Very addictive. After about 2 week I went to play it and it said &quot;You do not own this app&quot; and then links to the Amazon app store where I could purchase it for $1.99.  I've purchased apps for much more money but I won't purchase this one out of principle of how they went about this without warning.
0743246616|3.0|I was a little disappointed that it didn't have pictures with every recipe.  I like to see the finished product of what I'm going to be making.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|In my opinion, this is Dan Brown's best work.  Great cyber thriller with plenty of geeky stuff for all to enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the Final Book of The Hunger Games !!! I wanted to read it slowly, knowing it was the last of the series. I found however, that it was almost impossible to put it down once I started reading. It brought out so many emotions in me and by the time I finished it I was drained but very very satisfied.
B005DD7JL2|1.0|If you are a Tekken fan of any kind, please DO NOT watch this movie. It is absolutely atrocious in all ways.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game, very entertaining. I'm addicted to it can't put it down. Please add more levels, it would be great.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I really enjoy playing this mahjong game and am glad I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire.  Thank you for offering it.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I think it's a great game because it's cute and has action it's like really fun and it reminds me of temple run but better!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Meet Ender Wiggin: unusual before he was born. He was a third child in a place where families were limited to two children.  His older brother and sister were amazingly gifted, but without the temperament needed to become great military leaders. So the government ordered a third. Then things got really interesting.<br /><br />There are moments that are tough to read. Not difficult prose, but hard times. Ender has enough loneliness, hardship and angst to share with the whole class. It is his ability to tough it out and improve his social environment that shows he is extraordinary.<br /><br />Not for the very young. I would recommend someone be at least 10 before reading it, and sometimes not even then. There are a lot of grown up social and moral concepts in the story.<br /><br />It is definitely science fiction, but it is not about science. It's about humans. Most especially about a special gifted boy who has the talent needed to save the world.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love jigsaw puzzles! And having them here is really nice and i share on facebook and use some for desktop backgrounds!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written engaging story by master storyteller.  Riveting, I could not put the book down.  Unfortunately it was not memorable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun. If you like horses then this game is a great game for you. I recommend this game to people of all ages.
0765357151|5.0|Great read, and the origin of all of the apocalyptic themed stories we know and love.  There are other short stories in it as well.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|If you like anything that is good you will love this movie. I love other musicals and such and this is right up there with them. Super catchy combo's of songs, you won't be able to resist purchasing the soundtrack!
B0063M22QO|5.0|The tile designs make the game easier to play. Will enjoy this game for many hours.  Try it, you won't regret iy
B0079XPUOW|1.0|I haven't read such a tasteless cinical frustrated-authored piece of SF literature in a long time. Not worth either the money or the time I spent with it. Abandoned it at 80%, it was simply too much to take. To be avoided !!! Seems that not all Scalzi's books are good after all.
B004W1GCNC|2.0|It was a little dull for me. The story line wasn't very original, and I didn't did myself caring much for the characters.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|A great unique story with alot of &#34;sole&#34;.  Inspirational, fun and poignant and engaging!!  We recommend this movie very highly
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app. It works great. Our it wake me up every morning. Love it. Nothing else to be said. A great app.
0767903862|5.0|This book is both informative and entertaining. I dare you to read it and not laugh out loud. I highly recommend it.
B00BFBSV72|3.0|It's Doodle Jump with better graphics and Sonic the Hedgehog. Graphics are sharp, difficulty level challenging even on easy levels & especially where my son is concerned... It's a Sonic game!!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is one of the best stories of a typical trial attorney I have ever read.  I am going to read it again later this summer becaused I was so anxious to see the outcome I almost speed-read the first time.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book has me hooked! I just finished reading 'Tis: A Memoir' and can't wait to start 'Teacher Man: A Memoir'
B002S45V32|4.0|Entertaining. Good to finally be able to say I've seen another classic movie. I don't have four more words to write.
0446343129|4.0|I am just so disappointed with Sugar right now! Very informative book about sugar and what it is doing to our bodies.
B006LSZECO|3.0|When I started reading this book, I thought the chapter by chapter character switch would flow like pulling taffy - that tug and pull that keeps you engaged.  Instead the effect created a choppy, disjointed read that was pretty by the book predictable.  I didn't enjoy this book.
0143038095|5.0|I use this in my classroom. The kids seem to enjoy the story and it is easy to carry and read.
140006922X|5.0|I liked the book.  I've read similar accounts, but this book offers news twists on old (?) ideas.  I enjoyed reading this book.
0385474547|5.0|I use this in my classroom. The kids seem to enjoy the story and it is easy to carry and read.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Loved the book. Could not put it down. Grisham is a great story teller and I always look for his new works.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this movie for years and getting the chance to see it restored and on blu-ray made it all the more fun. There are some great special features on this disk also which are worth having a look at if your a fan of cinema or a fan of time period.<br /><br />If you have never seen the movie before, at this price, do it! Some of the effects may be dated compared to today's CGI but to watch the cleverness of the story unfold, and mystery of the &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; unravel is always a treat. Do yourself a favor, get a copy and have fun.
B005898DDO|5.0|very well done, interesting snippets from concerts and interviews with and about BD.<br />fun to step back in time to enjoy this.
B005544TRQ|5.0|LA Law may have set the bar, but Suits blows right past it Can't wait for the next season to be available on Amazon!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I took a bit of effort to figure out all of the capabilities, but after that...I can finally predict wx.  Well, almost predict wx.
B00493E1GI|4.0|I enjoyed watching this adaptation of the book of &#34;Eat Pray Love.&#34;  The book includes more thoughtful insights from the author in a way that the movie format makes more difficult to provide.  As I thought that the details and thoughtfulness of the author's internal monologues, I guess you could call them, added some positive depth to the story, it is unfortunate that they were not much included in the movie version.  However, it still has enough in it to make it a fun and inspiring movie, with solid acting, beautiful settings, and many of the important scenes, characters, and realizations of the book.  If you want something a little more thoughtful than the usual chick-flick, you should check this out!
B0024RID6U|3.0|I would rate this product, slow and not that endearing, this was tastless.  I thought this was a cool album when I was in high school.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this over a weekend after watching the Netflix series and I quite enjoyed both, though they're very different from one another. Piper Kerman is a good writer, I flew through this book and couldn't put it down, I was forced to in order to live my life, but when I got another chance I picked it right back up.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Too bad Apple must charge so MUCH for their add ons! However, these work very well. I plug a microphone into my Ipad and also use them to transfer pictures from my camera chip.
B008SVFX96|4.0|Richie's most varied solo album yet.  Love most of it but still trying to get into tracks 4 & 5.  Keep rockin' Rich!
B00271B752|5.0|Astonishingly great as all Al Pacino moves have the distinction of being. We love everything he does and every movie he is in.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|SPOILERS AHOY. There's no point trying to review this movie without them.<br /><br />So. Into Darkness sees the new Trek cast go up against a conspiracy within Starfleet; one that begins with a bombing on Earth and ends back in San Francisco, taking detours through the Klingon empire along the way. It's a big, ambitious film, with a clever, convoluted plot that is pleasantly cerebral. And as you almost certainly know, it features English rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. What he lacks in oiled, muscular chest real estate he makes up for in panache. Pine, Quinto and company are just as good as they were before, bringing their own twists to unmistakable classic characters. Peter Weller rounds out the cast as Admiral Marcus, who will surprise nobody when he turns out to be the bad guy, since he already was one on Enterprise.<br /><br />The movie does a ton of stuff very right. In this universe Kahn and Kirk meet for the first time under different circumstances and their relationship is one of tense violence mixed with sympathetic understanding. Kirk initially pursues Kahn, who is responsible for a devastating attack on London, all the way to the Klingon homeworld in an epic shootout (the klingons are kind of a three-way hybrid between their TNG appearances, Middle Earth orcs, and glam rockers, and it totally works) but becomes sympathetic to Kahn's plight as a victim of Marcus' blackmail. Marcus has thawed Kahn (a long-frozen warlord from Earth's distant past, for those not in the know) to help instigate a preemptive war with the Klingons (and to win it with an experimental battleship, the Vengeance). Kahn allies with Kirk, but the Enterprise and its crew are really only pawns as he struggles to recover his frozen soldiers and declare war on the universe.<br /><br />There's a ton of good stuff here. The interplay between everyone is great, the space battles are astounding, and Space seems more wild and wide-open than it did in the first reboot film. Yet the film is sloppy. The biggest problem is Kahn, who quite simply doesn't need to be Kahn. His identity is purely a shoutout to the popularity of Star Trek II; this Kahn is in no way dependent on the original, nor does he have a first meeting with Kirk for this film to spin off from. He could easily have been a totally original character. This fabricated twist that really only occurs in the minds of fans feels cheap, which is a shame because Cumberbatch is great. Conversely, Kirk and company all seem befuddled who Kahn is, when in the Trek universe casually meeting him would be kind of like walking into your favorite Starbucks to see Hitler as the barrista. So the people who SHOULD be excited about Kahn aren't, and the people who shouldn't be are expected to.<br /><br />Trim aside the fluff and the JJ Abrams ego trip though, and this is a really good Trek film. It has the action and epic setpieces we expect of the films, but there are mysteries to solve and alien worlds to visit and it feels a bit more like an episode of the show. The Spock-Uhura dynamic, which was kind of lame in the last film, is now genuinely appealing, and everyone has settled into their roles- none so much as Chris Pine, who affects Shatner's frustrated leader exasperation with perfect pitch. And I'm reluctant to even harsh on Abrams too much- I was no fan of Lost, but his work seems to be increasing in quality at a geometric rate.<br /><br />So buy this movie! Watch it, love it, and look past the hype to see talented actors bringing an exciting story to life. That is after all why we actually watch movies. And yeah, there is a Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan moment and yeah, it is actually pretty good. But I stand by my criticism.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Well acted, great looking, good music. It's all pretty good.<br />-Feels a bit more star-trek-ey.<br /><br />CONS<br />-BD is shaping up to be pretty bare-bones.<br />-BIG TWIST feels contrived and needless.<br />-Benedict Cumberbatch, talented as he is, lacks the rippling bronze physique of Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />NOTES<br />-In Space Seed, Kahn looks older than Kirk (because the actors are in fact 10 years apart). By that logic, he should now be even older since this Kirk is younger and Kahn has been thawed out for some time. Yet in this film their ages appear much closer (Cumberbatch is only 4 years older than Pine). That's some really nice cryogenic stasis, there.<br />-Throughout Wrath of Kahn, Shatner and Montalban were never actually in the same scene due to schedule and budget issues. In this film they share tons of set time, but are almost always divided in some way- by walkway levels in the fight with the Klingons, by force field on the Enterprise, by pylons on the Vengeance, and by paths through debris in the part where they, um, fly through debris. I have no idea if this is intentional but it is neat.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|So far, I've liked all the Harry Bosch novels I've read. Our hero, Harry, is realistic in that he doesn't win all his conflicts and is not a super hero. However, in the end, he usually comes out on top. These novels keep me coming back to my Kindle to see what will happen next, even though I should be doing something else. And then I seek my next read which helps me procrastinate even further on those other tasks.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in checking out The Last Coyote. I wondered how this would fit into the life of Harry Bosch, the detective. It was a bit of a stretch but it gave another perspective on his problems. I found it well worth reading.<br /><br />The one thing that sometimes bothers me is the way these novels end. it seems that the closing is just about anything that will answer remaining questions. I wonder if our author quickly ends the book in time for his dinner date.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of the best books I've EVER read. It really opened my eyes to what our troops do for us to live in a free world. I am very thankful for the Brown Family to share his life with us. God bless America.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 8 year old nephew and I played this game together and had lots of fun. Too difficult to play on his own but together it still took us a while to beat it.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|well i wanted to read this book because of the movie that just came out. i liked it, but there were certain things about it that i just didnt like. first of all, whats the big deal about clary? she is a strong character, but she cant really do much. when they faced the greater demon, she just screamed an reatreated into a corner. i mean, come on, even simon knew what to do there.<br />secondly, the point of view was a little bit annoying. it was third person, randomly switching which character's thoughts we had access to, making it all a little confusing. also, i feel like we barely got to hear what clary was thinking, and it was mostly her explining what was happening around her, so i feel like i didnt really know her or any of the other chracters either. i wanted to know what she was feeling about jace, about simon, and where did alec being gay come from? this was sort of random and unexpected.<br />i read this intervieaw with veronica roth about sacrificing charcters.she was sying how she had to be willing to kill of her characters to make tris's sense of loss at the end of the final battle feel greater, so she would always know why she ha to keep fighting. cassndra clare didnt have this, every person who hurt always  recovered, and it made me feel less emotional during the book. how bad can valentine really be anyway? no one died in this &#34;epic battle.&#34; i wish we could have known valentines motive for trying to get rid of the downworlders. why does he want that anyway, cause he feels like it?<br />the romance in this book was also pretty bad. we didnt know any of her feelings for jace, and she treated simon as her boyfriend anyway. and wow. thats one way to squash i love triangle. to find out you kissed your brother? thats extremely wierd, although neither clary or jace seems to think so. i literally sat there and read that with my mouth open<br />overall, the book was pretty good, although i didnt LOVE the charcters, it was a good story, with good humour, and a pretty good plot i guess…
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was my first time playing this and when I first saw I thought it wouldn't look good but I liked it
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought the book was underwritten, with a lot of missed opportunities for interesting plot points.  (What the heck was in that field, for instance?  That could have been something really cool but was never followed up.)  The movie left out those unfinished threads and was really well done.  The story was much more interesting visually, though the ending &#34;twist&#34; that wasn't really much of a twist still left a little to be desired.  However, I enjoyed it way more than I though I would.  Glad I didn't pay the big bucks to see it in the theater, but it's fine for rental.
B000RIWAVW|4.0|Very Good picture with average sound. I had to turn my tv up a little more. overall 4 stars.Thanks amazon.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really liked this movie and the incorporation of the characters from other Marvel movies.  Exciting, great action, lots of humor. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do so!

B00C0QOZP8|4.0|House of Gold and Bones Part 2 is an excellent follow-up/continuation of the first album.  While perhaps not quite as &#34;hard&#34; as the Part 1, G&B Part 2 is still full of soul and emotion and packs enough punch to satisfy any Stone Sour fan.

B0001AVZA8|4.0|just a lovely little movie when you're feeling down, like nothing ever goes right for you, then here comes Jack Nicholson. I think Keaton's never been better and nice performance by Amanda Peet as the daughter. A little too much Keanu Reeves for me.
B0000258CK|5.0|one of my favorite cd's.  i listen to it all the time when I am driving in my car.  oldie but goodie
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Personally, I never felt strongly about Iron Man or Iron Man 2, although IM2 definitely improved by including Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, an integral and awesome character in the Marvel franchise. IM3 follows The Avengers shockingly smoothly, addressing Tony's very realistic responses to his near-death experience in New York. Not only is Tony's PTSD and general anxiety addressed, but it is done respectfully. However,  this isn't the only great thing about this movie; the plot is intriguing and carries the film, and ends up subverting the often racist idea of terrorism hitting America - instead of the evil Chinese terrorist being the main villain, we instead have to worry about an angry and embittered white man. This is great to see, considering that movies recently have refused to recognize the racist stereotypes in media.<br /><br />Not only does this film deal with racism and anxiety in respectful ways, but Pepper Potts is allowed to shine in ways she previously hasn't. But none of these things take away from Tony's story; instead, they add to it. Tony's story involves other characters and isn't a cliche, and it's put together wonderfully and shockingly entertaining.<br /><br />IM3 could have easily been a bust and ignored these issues, but instead it dealt with them in a respectful and entertaining manner. If you haven't seen it and like the Marvel universe, I highly recommend this film. And if you just like good action films that deal with real life issues - definitely pick it up, or at least rent it or borrow it from the library when it's available.

B003RT0NK8|1.0|This is undoubtedly one of the worst wanna be scifi movies I wasted 2 hours of my life watching. Understanding that you must have a minimum level of intelligence to reach the far reaches of our solar system, how, I wonder, did these escape Earth's gravitational pull.
0425263924|5.0|I enjoyed this book, though there are parts that seemed to drag on a bit.  I was expecting this to be the last book in the series but was surprised when new story lines started to pop up towards the end of the story.  I look forward to the next book

1401937519|5.0|Even if you do not read the entire book, you will be amazed by Anita's account of her &#34;near death&#34; experience and what she was able to sense, see, hear, feel, etc.. I liked the book so much, I gave my original to a good friend who practices healing work and she enjoyed it also. The book also validated what my friend experienced during her own &#34;near death&#34; encounter. It's a Great Read!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This author kept me spellbound throughout this book.  Her development of the characters and the realm of the differences in each of them was beautiful.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|Having recently read &#34;The unlikely voyage of Jack de Crow&#34; the title interested me first.  A similar kind of adventure -  a simple story beautifully told.  I fell in love with Harold Fry as soon as he passed the first postbox and began his journey.  I loved his gradual awareness of the countryside and the world outside his village as well as his determination to complete his pilgrimage.<br /><br />I would recommend this lovely book to a wide age-range...from teens to the elderly as an example of goal-setting, patience and acceptance of diverse personalities.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Such an awesome documentary!<br /><br />Sound city was not only incredibly well produced, it really reflected the changes that are happening in the music world and how music production has changed over the years. As technology is improved, there are waves of changes, and whether it's for the \\"good\\" or \\"bad,\\" it's useful to reflect on how these changes affect music artistry.<br /><br />David Grohl's narration and directorial perspective is honest and strong. The music in the film is rock solid. Makes me remember why I love the Foo Fighters.<br /><br />Overall, Sound City is engaging, thought-provoking, and just plain fun. I'd highly recommend it.

B006C1DH92|3.0|It's Fruit Ninja with Dreamworks' Puss in Boots character. An okay game for kids with a few new modes and options as compared to the original Fruit Ninja, but at the end of the day, it's swishing your finger over animated fruit... I can't believe this is even a thing...
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Picks up 3+ millennia after Ender's Game. Provides a very satisfying story explaining what Ender and Valentine did after the events of the original book. Card deservedly won yet another Hugo and Nebula for this effort, which is an achievement that alluded the immortal Frank Herbert and Dune. Thought provoking and highly recommended. The next two books in the series provide closure, but they read more like soap operas. You could do well reading Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead and then just moving on.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love ALL the Cut the Rope games, they are so much fun and this is no exception. Hours of fun, download it now.

B003VS0CWO|5.0|I purchased this movie to share with my wife who had never seen it, I found the experience nostalgic, taking me back to the late '70's when I first saw the film, she found it weird and boring; she is from China afterall and likes cute cat videos.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I did not expect a murder mystery to be funny, but I kept laughing out loud as I was reading.  The main character, Detective John Corey, is constantly coming out with these hilarious sarcastic comments as written by the author Nelson DeMille.  Very funny stuff.  I have read eight of the author's books so far and they are all good, but Plum Island in my opinion is the most entertaining.  Do yourself a favor and read it.

B0064NTZQ2|4.0|When American crime writer James Sallis, wrote DRIVE, a standalone novel, in 2005...he had written six well-received detective novels featuring Lew Griffin. Critics agreed that James Sallis \\"may be one of the best mystery writers that most readers have never heard of\\" (Knight Ridder Tribune). In DRIVE, he combines murder, treachery, and payback in a sinister plot resembling 1940s pulp fiction and film noir. The story is told through a complex, cinematic narrative that weaves back and forth through time and place.<br /><br /> Producers Marc E. Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review of it in Publishers Weekly. The Driver intrigued Siegel because he was \\"the kind of character you rarely see anymore - he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it.\\" The character interested Platt because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.<br /><br /> Marc Platt Productions released DRIVE in 2011 as an American arthouse action crime drama film directed by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. Like the book, the film is about an unnamed Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a getaway driver for criminals.<br /><br /> STORYLINE: The Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a mysterious man who has multiple jobs as a garage mechanic, a Hollywood stuntman and a getaway driver. He has no name and no signs of any real personal life. He barely speaks and rarely shows any real emotions. The cars the Driver uses are provided by his mentor and boss, Shannon (Bryan Cranston) a crippled, washed-up body shop owner. Shannon wants to borrow money from Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks), a movie producer/loan shark/local gangster to invest in a racecar that he wants the Driver to race. A side story involving Driver and a neighbor (Carey Mulligan) with a young son may seem a detraction...but a mutual attraction develops and is woven into the plot effortlessly.... even when the neighbor's husband is released from prison.<br /><br /> The movie is well cast. Gosling plays the flawed loner well. Albert Brooks is brilliantly cast out of the box as the Bernie Rose, money man, a tough gangster....<br /><br /> The film of DRIVE is a very nice character study. A quiet action film with no shaky handheld cameras or loud noises....except the roar of a well tuned engine. At the end our hero drives off into the sunset without the girl. In a fast car....not on a horse.<br /><br />This is one example when the movie may be better than the book!o the plot effortlessly.... even when the neighbor's husband is released from prison.<br /><br /> The movie is well cast.

B000NGTJTY|5.0|It's rare to view a modern movie which deserves five stars.  Five stars are rewarded for movies like The Maltese Falcon, Lawrence of Arabia, The Killing Fields, and that caliber of movie.  This is that kind of movie.  Everything about this movie was excellent.  Bravo.

B0089LOG02|5.0|As a mother of two adopted children, this book impacted me because it made me realize that years ago unwanted children were treated as chattel and not human beings. I understand now how fortunate many of today's unwanted children are while some still remain as chattel. The book is an easy read in that the storyline is simply told. I read it in about five uninterrupted hours over a period of about a week. I couldn't put it down. It flows easily and is tremendously insightful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in real stories about often overlooked challenges in our lifetime.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|After not having read a &#34;Harry Hole&#34; story in quite some time, I was pleased to be reminded of Nesbo's writing style.

0385737955|4.0|The Maze Runner is a story about a 16-year-old boy named Thomas who has no memories of anything before he arrived at his strange new home; a place called the Glade.<br />  This story is set in a future post-apocalyptic time after sun flares have destroyed most of the earth and a new disease has taken its tole upon millions of people. Scientists have gathered together to devise a plan to rid mankind of this terrible disease. They build a place called the Glade. Surrounding the Glade is a maze that is filled with horrible monsters called Grievers. The scientists select a dozen of the smartest children from earth's remaining survivors, wipe their memories, and place them in the glade. Then, every month a new boy is brought to the Glade.<br />  The purpose of the Glade is to single out the smartest children; the best of the best. Thomas is the last boy to be brought to the Glade. Soon after, Teresa arrives. Together, Thomas and Teresa must solve the maze and  find a way out.<br />  This book is filled with action and mystery. The Maze Runner was an excellent read that had me hooked from the very first chapter. Although, the book had some very strange vocabulary with weird slang words.<br />  In my opinion, the plot in The Maze Runner was well constructed, but rather slow, although many parts of the story were filled with action. It felt as though James Dashner (the author) over-explained things, which contributes to the plot being so slow. But other than that, Dashner perfectly described Thomas's feelings and emotions. I could easily relate to the main character. I can't wait to find out what happens next!<br />  Overall, The Maze Runner was a wonderful book with amazing characters and an  interesting cliffhanger that left me begging for more. I would definitly recommend The Maze Runner to anyone who likes action/mystery stories.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I liked the book b/c i like true crime but it was so sad to read how this one man brainwashed a woman to help him kidnap and destroy this young girl's innocence was disturbing on so many levels.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I was extremely surprised at how good this free app is. It allows you to visualize the signal strengths of the various access points you may have in your home.  There are at least five different graphical charts plus the ability to determine which channel you should be using based on what other access points are in or around your home environment. It also has an aural indication of signal strength for each access point you choose to monitor,  I would have given it a five if I could have readily seen a way to print out some of the graphs. Works extremely well on my Kindle Fire. I used it as a precursor before using EKAHAU HEAT MAPPING on my laptop which has the print capability.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I  could sit for hours and play this, my kids were  obsessed with it.  This is the advanced one so it is harder  than the yellow and  purple one, for kids (preteens and teens) this might be okay but mine preferred the  other one.  My husband likes this one.
1419705644|5.0|Lots of fun/interesting stuff written from the perspective of one of the characters.  Any Adventure Time fan will love it
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|fun but challenging game.  keeps the 6 year old occupied and my brain young.  enjoyable for all ages.  well worth the cost.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|It is very interesting, well written and informative. I recommended the book to many of my friends already! Really worth while reading!
B004SKIPXW|2.0|The story line is wrong. The science fiction is horrible. The driving is worse. The Gore is overbearing. The 3D effects were OK but nothing outstanding.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This review is one of the very few that I have felt driven to do, mainly because I was absolutely riveted to Dr. Alexander's personal account of his near death experience.  I purchased the audio book because I wanted to hear him tell  his story and he didn't disappoint. His tone and modulation was that of a professional speaker.<br /><br />This is not the only book that I've read on this topic as the subject has always fascinated me, however I've always had doubts as to the credibility of the story line.  That is, until my experience with the content of this book.  For those of you who have had similar thoughts and feelings this is a &#34;must read&#34;.  It will uplift you and renew or awaken the belief that our existence doesn't end when we die, the big show is yet to come.  I now believe that my life on this earthly plane is more meaningful and look forward to the next dimension.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|HUGE, AMAZING SOUND! ...imagine  Lacuna Coil meets Rob Zombie. Yeah, it's that incredible.<br /><br />There is no stopping In This Moment and this is the album that captures the depth and talent of this hard hitting and brilliantly brutal hard rock legends-to-be.<br /><br />Creative, bloody, and relentless. This album dominates and is a must have for lovers of ROCK!<br /><br />I love it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this story. A chance for folks/kids to think outside themselves and realize there are people with bigger problems than yours and even with and illness like cancer  you can still find joy.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|(...Would recommend to anyone...with one grand exception...I was charged $54 & some change.... when I know that's not the actual<br />cost... (cost is $29 & change with tax,,,etc.) Basically I'm being charged almost twice as much from agents that won't bother to research as to what the real problem is & why... Then to make matters worse everytime I purchase the whole season &#34;episode #5&#34;<br />(name of episode being &#34;Damaged&#34;) is always excluded & I need to pay for it separately...)  DO I REALLY NEED TO GO ON...??!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I would not waste any money on this movie. It almost seemed to have a lot to say about Tom Cruises personal life as the clone girlfriend was a red head like his first wife and the new wife was a brunette. He just does not really cut it anymore as an actor which is sad.<br />I was looking forward to the sci fi, but it was a big disappointment. The story was a bit hard to follow. There was not enough connection to the real humans.<br />Just don't bother.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had known about the orphan trains, but this novel brings that part of our history alive and is told in an interesting way if you do not mind continuous jumps in time.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Awesome! Loved this movie! Can't wait to see the 3rd one! Definitely recommend this movie and would see it again!!!
0670020745|5.0|Jill Bolte Taylor is a wonderful writer and speaker. What a fascinating book from her scientific background to document her own stroke, step by step as it was happening. Be sure to watch her UTube Videos also.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game! My kids and I love it! It's so easy to get caught up in that you keep wanting to go back again and again
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|This must have been a gift for someone else because I don't remember watching the DVD.  I'll have to try to remember who I gave it to so I can borrow it back.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|This is always a good movie and we enjoyed watching it again! Looking forward to the next Thor movie that I'm sure is on the way.
B00CE27NE8|5.0|As a San Franciscan I've owned and enjoyed the DVD of this movie for many years. I was happy when it was announced for re-release as a bluray disc  but had only hopes that it would look much better that its already acceptible DVD pressing. Thus, I was greatly pleased by the immediately noticable improvements to its video and audio presentations (but mostly the former). as the color saturation, black levels and detail were noticable improved.  For the modest price you can't go wrong...
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Very easy to use saved me lots of time already I am in sales, I put on 90k in miles a year. Get this app!
0765316897|1.0|In a trilogy of admittedly excellent writing, I fell for the characters and rooted for their success in overcoming their  graphically unforgiving enemies. They are smart,brave, and heroic. Sanderson contrives an ending that turned me off to ever letting him do that to me again.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Should be able to achieve more crystals other than just buying them. Don't like getting one at a time here and there.
B00B3L3RPA|2.0|Boring. Mary Shelly was a great writer in her day, but sadly, her day, her style, her monster is very out of date. Had to stop reading about 1/3 of the way through because I broke the point on the pencil that I was using to stab myself in the eyes.
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|A powerhouse of a product that you can count in in a pinch that makes taking photos a blast! Highly recommended.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|Dido's album No Angel came out over 13 years ago in Feb of 2000 so needless to say her style has grown  and changed with her. This album has heart, stellar lyrics, bass lines with depth accompanied by moderate to heavy rythm lines and some new additions that only today's technology could lend. I think this is the best album since No Angel, and even though I still listen to No Angel, I to have grown up since it came out and am starting to prefer The Girl That Got Away. Notable songs would be Blackbird, No Freedom, The Girl Who Got Away, New Years Eve, and The Day We Went to War. Definitely worth buying.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is the second best CD I have ever found.  It is soothing and really relieves my stress.  And cheap.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey itself was reward enough for joining Amazon Prime!  I sew creatively for me work at [...] and I was in 7th heaven enjoying all 3 seasons as I worked in my 'studio'.  Ohhhh - how I wish we DRESSED anything at all like this today!!
B00006LIRI|3.0|The last song in the album is messed up.  And the case was destroyed.  But I bought it used so it is what it is.  And the songs were not as good as 80-90 version.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Only Ken Follett can captivate you. One of the best of the best. My second or third read and loved every moment of it. Go for it!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Great show! So excited amazon has it on instant watch! I coulndt wait for the dvds to ship, and with amazon great prices why should i?
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Loved the book. It affirms all I have been reading, believing and experiencing! You have to try these experiments and put them to regular practice in your life!
B000WBZZB6|1.0|OK I NEVER DO A REVIEW IN ALL THE LOYAL YEARS I HAVE DONE BUSINESS WITH AMAZON  VERY REAR.<br /> I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO AND GOT IT AFTER A  FEW DAYS,WHEN I FINALLY WENT TO WATCH IT IT DOSE NOT PLAY. I END UP FINDING OUT THIS IS A MOVIE FOR ANOTHER COUNTRY NOT FOR USA  NO WARNINGS NO NOTHING, I HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON THIS SITE. NO ONE CALLED ME BACK NO BACK UP FROM AMAZON  NOTHING. DO YOU THINK IF IM A CUSTOMER BUYING FROM YOU IN THE USA SHOULD THERE BE A WARNING THIS WILL NOT PLAY IN YOUR COUNTRY. FIGURES THATS WHY WE ARE IN TROUBLE IN THIS COUNTRY EVEN ANOTHER BIG COMPANY LIKE AMAZON  USA DOSE NOT  CARE IF IM HAPPY.  DONT BUY FROM MOVIE MARS NO CALL BACK NO FIX NO PROBLEM.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love kindle for android. I can access my library from my tablet or phone. Its easy to use and I can read my current book anytime I have a moment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so easy to understand, it is not blurry or glitchy, it is family friendly and best of all, ITS FREE!!!!! GET THIS APP! GET THIS APP! GET THIS APP! Thank you Natural Motion for a great game.
B0095H4FAA|3.0|It felt like the book just went on...and on...and on. I thought even the \\"suspenseful\\" parts were a little slow going. I had a hard time wanting to keep reading it. I gave it 3 stars because it seemed average to me.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Written with the care and detail of writers from the past. I feel as if I know the individual characters personally. I was a little disappointed with the ending, I would have preferred the final insight to have come from one of the other characters.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I loved this movie! It made me cry, but I recommend it to everyone! I wonder why I waited that long to watch it! :)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of the best sci go shows ever.I was stuck on it from the first show.The cast is great and the plot twist seem to keep you thinking about what's going to happen next. Dr Bishop is the man.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|only wish there were more seasons.  Looked forward to viewing it at the end of the day.  Love the BBC series
B006DZYM0A|4.0|This was recommended to me by a friend.  It is very complex.  You will have to really listen to see why it's called Margaret.  Good performances by all.  My only problem when I bought it is that I thought I was buying the full-length director's cut (3 hours) but I got the theatrical release instead.  I would like to see all three hours, it's that good.
B009AY04A8|2.0|I am frustrated by the process of searching! Every time I pan with the light on the second level my finger has to stay on the screen so it hinders my view, however, if I take my finger off and place it back down it thinks I am clicking on an object. I was penalized 4 times when I was just searching for the candles. I had all but 1. Obviously it is the hardest one to find and I timed out because it thought I was guessing but I was trying to move the light and had to lift my finger to see under it. Maybe a double tap should be developed for touch screen users.
0345803450|3.0|Enjoyable, but rather light weight for this author whom I admire and I was slightly disappointed.  Nevertheless, the story is intriguing, and its context is unique and characters are intelligent and flawed.  It has interesting turns and twisted humor in it.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|AMAZING PERSON AND SHE HAD AN AMAZING MOTHER.  WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES.  THE AMERICAN ACCENT DONE BY A FRENCH ACTRESS IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE AS WELL :)
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I was attracted to the diet in an article  in The Wall Street Journal - said men loved it because it was so simple.<br />I HAVE FOUND THAT TRUE that's why I love it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|True artist! Fresh pop sound.  I love her new music. Looking forward to the album release.  Lady Gaga is here to stay!
0812550706|4.0|It was an interesting, if not disturbing, story.  I will be reading the rest of the saga, or at least starting it.
B000SINT52|5.0|I love Michael Moore's documentaries and was thrilled at the price. I will look on Amazon before I pay high store prices for these films  ever again.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It was a good story but a lot was left unsaid. There were so many loose ends that the novel felt incomplete.  I was disappointed.
B002WJI65S|5.0|I bought a couple of Mario stuffed plush toy for my room and they are perfect! Nothing wrong with them, they are durable, good quality and what you see is exactly what you get!
B009R659L8|3.0|There were too many characters too keep up with.  I have read almost all of Mary's books and do enjoy her books, this one just didn't hold my interest like so many of her others.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|its not what I expected.  Cheap Band not leather looks cheap, I was really let down, I would not recomend this watch.
B0031Y4A8U|5.0|This has got to be one of the best debut albums ever made - along with, maybe Led Zeppelin's and Boston's debuts (if you're into that Bostony sort of thing... or The Cars... or Van Halen). The thing about 'Black Sabbath' is that, sonically, it sounds INCREDIBLE going on 44 years old!!! The cover is epic - there's just nothing wrong with this album whatsoever. And this Rhino Vinyl issue is totally solid. My advice - buy it before they (the Rhino reissue lps) become collector's items!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|First played on my phone, now replaying it on my kindle...it is too fun!! Perfect level of challenges. Keep them coming guys!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is a lot of fun and time consuming.  I really like trying to find all the clues.  awesome
B00BXI26XC|5.0|Love this app , my partner is mad about aviation and he loves this app.What with my son's and now my partner I have to beg to use my own kindle.
0385349947|5.0|The candor and emotive way this is written will speak to women at all levels of their career. I empathized and realized other than the locations it was very similar to my own feelings and career path.
B003VANOFY|5.0|great head set would recommend to all ..product works as advertised. my ears don't hurt  for wearing for a few hours.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Just didn't seem like the enthusiasm by Archer was there for this one. Hope the next installment is back to the quality of the first two.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This is so easy to use and so much fun. One can make some terrible pictures of themselves.  I did.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|This was a little confusing and hard for me to follow, the color , and graficks was also good .Thanks
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|An excellent first Jack Reacher for those of us who started in the middle somewhere.  Have fun going back to the start.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|This app is to over rated, It is also to complicated to get what sounds that you want. I will not recommend.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|One more for my collection, great music as always. A very complete DVD with almost all of the famous songs.
1402766785|5.0|It was a book I needed, and I made the Amazon choice to deliver it. Everything worked. Thanks for making it happen..
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|What can I possibly say about Armin that hasn't already been said? The English language has only so many adjectives, after that you kind of make it up as you go along. \\"Intense\\" is, without question, in my opinion, Armin's best effort to date...and he has been around how long? Amazing. I am always amazed at exceptional talent. I was such a big Chicane fan for so long until I heard my first Armin album. It was \\"Mirage\\". After that, I was hooked. I think I have tracked downed as many ASOT CD's as I can find. Music perfection. Want my opinion of favorite tracks? ALL.
B001VQF9N0|4.0|Great fit and price.  The composite chamois needs some technical work to improve &#34;padding&#34; without adding thickness. Great fit throughout, and the wider straps make for secure, snug, comfortable fit.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|Game progresses very slowly. I cannot imagine kids sticking with it for very long. I'm penalized for having started before last major update so there are no more rocks for me to get that are needed for upgrades. And yet I continue to play.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show will have you hooked from the very first episode! There are so many characters and so many plot twists! My husband and I both enjoy this show. The music is great too! We even bought the Seasons 1-4 soundtrack!
B0074VA2T2|5.0|my toddler loves this app!!  it's absolutely perfect for restaurant peace!!  he's learning & loves eric carle so this is fun for him!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Program let's you edit but will not save the changes. Has some nice editing features. It is worthless without the ability to save.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Doesn't work. Just locks up my kindle immediately on startup. Not sure what the issue but this app won't even open.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I always enjoy his books. Left you wanting to read on to find out more. Does not disappoint you. The great works
B00DNO3JUI|3.0|For me, storyline is too pessimistic. It sort of had a happy ending, but it told too long to get there.
0061122416|3.0|However, no where in the information did it state that the pages had been highlighted.  Just be careful what you are purchasing.  I would have preferred if the student  could determine what he thought was important verses what others thought.<br /><br />I did receive the book quickly so the summer assignments were completed prior to the new school year.<br /><br />I would purchase from this person again, after making inquiry  about the condition of the book (i.e. highlighting passages)
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This is a fantastic piece of historical fiction focusing on a Jewish family's struggles right before, during, and after World War 2.  It might sound weird, but I liked the writing style so much, it had kind of a calming effect on me.  I don't know if anyone else ever experiences that or not when they read?  It's like the words flowed together perfectly, nothing seemed forced, nothing broken, very well-written.<br /><br />Greta was beautiful, her thoughts, the way she spoke, her insecurities, all seemed so real.  It was like I forgot that I was reading about a fictional character.  I knew she was Jewish, and I knew from the synopsis that this story would deal with WW2, so early on in the book, when I read about Greta and read her interactions with Wilhelm, I felt a small sense of melancholy regardless of whether or not I was supposed to feel that, but it's that feeling that made the story more powerful to me.  I think the subtle foreshadowing the author gives the reader, such as Wilhelm's view of the German writers, made me connect with the characters on more than a superficial level.  I'll leave it at that, but I would like to thank the author for sharing this wonderful story with the world.  I highly recommend this book.
1401201911|5.0|It was gift.  My  son-in-law was thrilled.  In haven't read it.  It came right on time and in excellent condition.
B000I9X668|5.0|Office Space is a classic! A movie you can watch over and over again. if you work in a cube, gotta watch
B008JFLWLE|5.0|bought this on a whim. It's pretty cool. I have my kindle with me every day at school. When I have a reluctant or low student, I'll let them see this app and use it for a while. Unlike a calculator, you can see the equation in bold type with the answer. This way you can check for mis-types. You need to use parenthesis when subtracting negative integers. Otherwise it doesn't translate your writing correctly. Pretty cool. Surprising that it's free.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book is for anyone new to writing ebooks and has no idea where to start. It give you all the relevant information you need for putting together your book in a format suitable for kindle from front cover to 'the end'.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for a very very very very good game for you to play have fun.I was going to have a fun game for a very very very fun
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The game gets rather difficult but it'll keep you entertained. Right now I'm stuck and I wish there was an option for some help,other than the hint tab.  All in all, I guess I can't complain too much!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Flawless&#60;3 love you mommy monster. thanks for everything you do for us monsters, can't wait for ARTPOP 2013 and #swinefest xoxo
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies!! I would recommened it to anyone. Thank you.<br />Sandra is amazing
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I Hate games with fake reviews but this 1 is real! the game is beautiful and very fun there needs to be more player's.  !&iexcl;!!!!!!&iexcl;!
B00008G7UF|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies!! I would recommened it to anyone. Thank you.<br />Meg Ryan is the best
B009EBLCK8|5.0|This is a fantastic series, even if the Hounds of Baskerville (yes, that's what it's called) is the weakest episode they've done. It's still sharp. It's still high quality.
0201433079|5.0|This book was taught in my university (University of Windsor).I had to drop the course after mid term 2.This is a hard book for no doubt and not for beginners.I never took the course again cause it was not mandatory.but now I know what I really missed.I wish I could go back to school only for that course.The book is well coded cause after graduation I spend hours and hours to learn.If you are a serious programmer and like to learn more ..just buy the book .It does not matter either you like windows or nix based OS.By the end you will be a pro.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this show. It's smart and well done. Martin Freeman is great, as is Mr. Cumberpatch.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This was a very good book. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Will definitely read his other works. Awesome!
B00DHQHAH0|4.0|Funny, smart and full of babes.<br />It's blue sky TV at its absolute pinnacle. I, for one, cannot wait for more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not a long winded book reviewer.  If you like the works of Brandon Sanderson and the like you will appreciate this book.  I wish it was longer due to how much I enjoyed it.
B005544V6A|4.0|I really enjoyed watching exciting legal cases and bold negotiations for high-stakes deals unfold in each episode.<br /><br />Towards the end of the season, I began to question whether or not I would really respect the character Mike Ross. Mike Ross performs a few very unethical actions. He escapes the consequences with a bit of luck, wits, and Harvey's help, but he never pauses to think \\"that was really stupid and I should never do that again\\". This has sort of turned me off to watching the following seasons, but I would still recommend the initial chunk of Season 1 to anyone.
030758836X|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Sometimes the hype is right!  Can't wait for the movie - Rosamund Pike is PERFECT for Amy!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Awesome show! It's darker than the show bones, but it makes you root for a killer because he kills bad people that slip through the fingers of justice. That makes the show interesting because people do get away with murder at times.
B008602KQI|3.0|I found the storyline to be generic.  The acting was competent but uninspired, perhaps a tribute to the script.  I was hoping for better.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Sometimes the games will freeze but they are pretty good at compensating when it does other than that....pretty good game!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I love Jodi Picoult. She is one of my favorite authors. I would recommend it. It really makes you think about how hard life can be.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Caught this movie in the theaters with friends, and I fell so in love with the fantastical story line, despite the headache induced by the twisted plot. When Amazon had the movie on sale for $5, I snatched it up quicker than you can say &#34;free two day shipping.&#34; Great buy!
8866130915|5.0|My husband very much likes this brand of notebook and consistently buys it year after year. It meets his needs.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|If you enjoyed the previous two sequels then this will not disappoint. More of the same. It has it's share of cat boos and all in all was a pleasant way to spend a few hours zoning out.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|This is a great working combo of science geek and hard core military man.  Great visual effects, characters, and story line.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|The wraith look kind of cheesy and some of the acting isn't that great, but I still love this show. The storyline and everything are still good enough for me to give this show 5 stars.
0307959856|3.0|I am a big Jane Austin, Pride and Prejudice fan, and that might be why I was so disappointed in this work. I love P.D. James' works but this fell flat in my opinion. it started off quaintly but it became a chore to finish reading it.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I love the movie and the DVD was in great condition and plays very well.  Thank you very much.  I am very happy.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This movie was really horrible. Plot was silly, directing was an insult to the viewer and acting was subpar. Not to mention the childish dialogues. It is sad seeing Morgan Freeman star in such productions. Stay away!
B00006FDCD|5.0|The disk and case were in very good condition. I'm a very big Stephen King fan so its great to add it to my collection.
1469234246|5.0|I am a big fan of the architecture and his other work. I knew of his multiple marriages and was aware of the murder scandle in his life.  However, I found this book (written by a woman) to have a very different perspective from other sources. Written from the perspective of an  emotional connection with the world around her, the author was able to hone into the relationship between a man and a woman and how thier paths in life crossed and changed their future forever.  I thought it was a good story and I enjoyed the insights into the deep rivers below the surface.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|This book is very easy read, full of small (and big) histories illustrating the power of habits. Not boring at anytime and giving very usefull insight and also advices about changing habits. If you want to get rid of a bad habit, this will help you!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is great it helps me get up for everything I need to. Best clock app out there they're are so many great features too
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I grew up watching Star Trek and it hasn't disappointed me yet from the big screen... Can't wait for the next one...
B004XQO90O|3.0|The ending was a real mind blower. Kind of sad. Not a rewatcher for me.Glad I didn't pay a high price for it.
1401234550|5.0|New 52 proving to be really good. Awesome art and storyline. Vol. 1 was surprisingly good. Looking forward to vol. 2.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|really entertaining and funny as well as a bit of a serious side. Definately a re-watcher. Can't wait for Red 2
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Sooooo much better when mobile ( for me it's my tablet) than having to use the browser to access game.... great paired with the FB app, too :-)
B002AWX6UM|5.0|A well written book I personally found very interesting to read as I am currently working in Sierra Leone. It just makes you sad to read how the Rebel war affected the people in Sierra Leone that took place about 10 years ago and to see visible evidence of the war.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Action packed, intrigue filled, page turner, fantastic read and almost any other descriptive term can be applied to Damien Stevenson's Ian Flemings files: Operation Armada. This world war two epic novel explores the exploits of the real life naval hero in her majesties service. This is gripping World War Two novel crafted from the real life of Ian Fleming upon which the James Bond series is based.<br />Damien Stevenson has written a terrific spell binder which is sure to please any James Bond or action/adventure buff. The language is incredibly descriptive harkening back to the semi-melodramatic style of the 1930's and 40's.<br />This is a great way to spend a weekend or a couple of week nights.

0545405777|5.0|Be aware of the buyer you buy this from! I tried ordering this collector's edition through someone called  &#34;Wakullabooks&#34; last year got for a birthday present and they ripped me off. I paid for a collector's edition, and they sent me the standard hardcover. Normally a seller will refund your account like 10bucks if they screw up if you want to keep your item, but they would only refund me if I mailed the book back without any promise of sending me the collector's edition. The seller I bought from was from Amazon LLC this time so I wouldn't get screwed this time. Hard slip case and on it the mocking jay is raised in a gold color, carrying a bow instead of an arrow. The book itself has deckled edges, that uneven page printing to give the appearance it was hand made, the cover of the book itself is a canvas cover with and an inlaid silver arrow. The inside of the cover is crimson red, and the next page has a black and white toned print of the original cover of the mocking jay carrying the arrow. Only thing I don't like is that with a Collector's Edition, they could've made it with a silk book mark ribbon. I would give a 4.5star if I had the option, but I'll give it a 5.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The writers do a good job of resolving situations after a few episodes. I don't like when something drags on over the whole season (or longer). The season ending was a pretty big surprise but I won't give it away. I am impatiently waiting until January so I can see what happens next!
B0026772N8|4.0|I can see why this book widly talked about I really enjoyed the story with in the philosophy, must read
B009WUBERW|3.0|Unfortunately...the trailer contained most of the best parts. I chalk it up to another movie where the trailer made it seem better then the movie actually  was.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun and a  challenge its great for ur reflexes to be tested and it s great to try to beat your friends on fb
B009GEFXLC|4.0|enjoyable watch good characters and watchable episodes. The dynamic between shows a symbiotic relationship that is interesting to watch and see grow
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's great I play every time I have a chance.  The auto save feature on exit is a wonderful thing to.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I love this movie. It's funny and entertaining, but don't take it too seriously. :) The shipping was fast and the packaging was great. If you like quirky, you'll like this movie!!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I liked Tom Cruise's character..I think I'll watch it again...maybe this weekend. Eight more words required, I'll make them short.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This biography of Tesla excited me and made me aware of, among many things, a few ways to overcome veniality, be true to yourself, work hard, AND make a difference with your life.  That Tesla was an unsung genius is just the start of this story.
0345535421|5.0|Enjoyed the book as much as the HBO show.  The book took a while to get here, but worth the wait.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love Mahjong and had to have it immediately for my new Fire.  This one was free and works.  I don't like the layout selection process very well but that's not a huge deal, I guess.
0345803485|4.0|Good condition and enjoyed the story.  Too much x-rated material I thought which is why I only gave a 4 star as it took away from the good story line.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book a long time ago and loved it tremendously - as I did all of Dan Brown's books.  They are interesting and exciting!
B001XUJMZK|4.0|I haven't watched this movie in a number of years.  It is aging really well.  Good character development, classic battle scenes with solid effects.  Streamed well via my Xbox app.. Good way to spend any night.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I had to have a Solitaire game on my new Kindle Fire so I got this free one.  It works just fine so I'm satisfied with it.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Fast paced. Good characters. Fun stories. That's why we watch the series. We love Louis. This guy needs to win some awards!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show is interesting.  The characters have style and grace.  The story line is compelling and keeps you coming back for more.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Katniss steps up to take her sister's place in the 74th Annual Hunger Games. This movie has everything: a great plot and everything a movie needs to keep you interested from the beginning of the movie to the end of the movie.  You must see it.
0545586178|5.0|The second books builds well on the first, and was a thrill to read. 6 more words required for review.
B00BP0MJ08|5.0|There were MANY gods around the years-past world, with more than a few remaining in our present world.  The survivors of the god-wars are present in today's world.  The African gods and American Indian gods have been swallowed-up by the gods of the Bible.  Let us keep-up the &#34;good&#34; work?<br />Bill C:
B003VWU2WA|3.0|First off, its no doubt a cool little device and the soft blue light underneath is attractive. BUT I found the knob itself to be not as well built as I thought, and this is a lot lighter than the descripton would indicate. More importantly, it is not as fluid as a high-end jog-shuttle, and the knob itself does not stay firmly in place as it should, creating some instability. At least mine didn't. As a little device to aid editing, it suffices I suppose. But the drivers make it a little risky to use with FCPX, as it played havoc with my time-line. Other than that, if you want a way to do frame advances or scrolling, separate from the keyboard short cuts, then this is ok. If all you used it for was a cool volume control, then this is perfect. All in all I was not as impressed as I was hoping I would be, so it is going back.
B000HL2J0G|2.0|Kinda predictable plots.  I'm an engineer, so I am skeptical of several things he does and it seems a bit made up.  Not realistic enough for me to be intrigued.
9382951008|4.0|The story did not come together as the other previous books. It is still very interesting read.Those who borrowed the book are of the same opimion
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn was a great writer, I've read all of his books, he will be missed. Maybe he was working on another novel when he passed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book got me from the start. I tried to imagine learning my husband murdered someone, would I turn him in and lose my cushy life? The ending was good too, it really gave the reader something to think about, how things would be in all the various scenarios.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The book was thoroughly entertaining and had many interesting twists. I read this as an ebook and really loved it.
B00000K3UU|5.0|product is as expected. watch it as often as I have time for. it's a dvd so not much else to say.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a awesome game to play. I just got the game and it it's amazing game I love the game.
B0094M0P4G|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! The only thing that would have made this any better would be if they did a duet!
B00499QUK2|5.0|This slipped past me for some reason while I was living in London. Now that I left, I'm devouring the series on Amazon Prime streaming movies. It re-imagines Holmes and Watson in modern-day London while remaining loyal to the original plots and an array of details from the original stories. Where Holmes telegraphed Watson, in this series he texts. A Study in Scarlet becomes A Study in Pink. Watson is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. Holmes has a website where he advertises his services. Watson has a blog where he recounts his adventures with his friend and roommate Holmes. They call each other Sherlock and John, rather than Holmes and Watson. Yes, they still live at 221B Baker Street. The humor is subtle, but tensions also run high. Not giving away anything else. Just watch it.
B009AY04A8|3.0|The game is very similar to other games by Nevosoft. I wish here was a zoom on some of the missions. and there needs to be less talk between missions. Overall, if you like hidden object games this one is good as any other. It is a good time killer if you are waiting on a flight or other situations where you have long periods to wait.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I think this is the best game in the world so I think you should get it<br />Even if you think it looks boring
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|An amazing set where you hear the transition and progression from early blues to the 80's powerhouse.  Play them in order and it is literally a musical biography of ZZ Top.  And you cannot beat this price.  If you have not already heard, these are all the original mixes.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A real fetish item for fans of these groundbreaking movies.  I know we don't really NEED physical Blu-Rays anymore (all that clutter!) but the extras on this set are awesome!
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Few have walked the surface of the earth with such audacity that their very presence emanates the soul of words. To call him the \\"Greatest Poet Alive\\" is a testament to his verbal prowess and his profound use of the language of love, poetry. Not only is author James Gordon's prose praise worthy, but it is also a culmination of love, lust, desire, and pleasure all rolled up into one. After reading his oeuvre, \\"Revenge of the Orgasm\\", I am convinced that Mr. Gordon is a poetic genius. His use of metaphor and word play, paint a rich tapestry that draws the reader deeper into each word, line, paragraph, and poem.<br /><br />As a collection of sensual poems, there are many passages that standout; however, I particularly enjoyed, \\"Obsessed\\" and \\"Chocolate, Powdered Sugar, and Strawberries\\". In Obsessed, Gordon illustrates the feeling of a man being consumed by a woman he desires. In Chocolate, Powdered Sugar, and Strawberries; he illuminates the longing of a man who craves for intimacy with a woman he has just begun dating. Both poems provide a glimpse into the mind of Gordon and provide the reader with an experience that will tantalize the senses.<br /><br />In my opinion, men and women can both share this book as they nurture and flourish in love together. REVENGE OF THE ORGASM embodies passion, which extends far beyond its pages. It should only be consumed by candlelight, wine, and soft music.<br /><br />This book is a phenomenal read!<br />-Sahpreem A. King   Author & Publisher   WOT Digital Press®
B009AY04A8|3.0|Not a bad game for the kindle.  The only thing that the game really needs is the option to skip the conversations.
B00AYQNOU8|3.0|This is more like a visual documentary (without dialogue).  I found it interesting, compelling, and, in some cases, disgusting.  But, the documentary showed the truth of modern society.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B000002GJS|4.0|Bryan Adams rocks it over and over and over again. Love his high energy tunes. WIth a coffee the day gets off to a nice start!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I played the game for about two months. and it kept crashing so I uninstalled the game and now I start! all over.  eroymotion
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk is talented beyond words. Catchy tunes. Eclectic blend of music from each decade, with the Moog synthesizer spicing up the tunes. Georgio is cool. The headpieces........even cooler!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Good reads.  Some of the. Situations did not seem plausible.<br />Too much left to reader.  But stories moved along good.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Carlos knows how to change with the times, but Smooth, well that is a song for the ages I'll never get tired of. &#34;Give me your heart make it real, or forget about it.&#34; Ok I'm down with that and Carlos is absolutely one of the all time guitar masters. Supernatural indeed!
0817439390|5.0|I found the book easy to follow and made explanations very understandable. I also liked having a website to go to that showed a visual of what to do and how to do it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I GOT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON TOO PLAY HE LOVES ANYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH ANGRY BIRDS. I ALSO ENJOY<br />PLAYING IT TOO.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|well it works pretty good but sometimes it freezes and it causes me to shut it down then restart it., but other than that i like it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved the story of Hazel and Augustus. Loved their sense of reality (& humor). I really didnt want it to end!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Very fun game! It will keep you entertained and it never gets old. All ages can play. You should try it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Once I started reading this trilogy, I couldn't put it down. I was upset when I got to the third book so fast.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|One of the things I enjoyed about this book is that they were short stories, Simple to read one without feeling sorry to leave the chapter.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Great cast & music, superior productions.<br />Love it they tackle major issues in society & teach Teens to express their feelings thru song & dance.
0375505091|5.0|She's one of my favorite photographers. her photos are very flexible and they have a go. beautiful book , thank you!
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I have deleted this game so I really can not comment on this one. They need a star for &#34;mistaken download&#34;. or even a catagory for &#34;Kids&#34;.
1416550534|4.0|Absorbing story, well written. Great atmosphere. Interesting characters. Beautiful rendition of life in an English Country House in the early twentieth century. Great read.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|When a product like this functions as it should, it make dull reading.  It installed without a problem.  It functions without a problem.  No more needs to be said.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Readers will have a plethora of mixed emotions as they experience this phenomenal coming of age story. It's wicked and racially inept which keeps one's mind awake throughout the entire storyline. This unforgettable story highlights a struggling family amongst their time of healing as their determination fights to win. Our hero, Sebastian has a thirst for knowledge which is almost addicting thanks to the author's gift of creating characters that refuse to go unnoticed. The family portrayed refuses to be ignored outside of the Jewish community, but yet keeps their secrets concealed. An amazing well told story that will appeal to all.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I'm used to PD JAMES mystery style so to read this novel is like reading a completely new author!  The read  was a very similar pacing but she captured a wholly different world. Well done
B005UG542S|5.0|Potter generation for a reason. This is one of our eras finest movies of one of our generations finest series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham as lawyer must think like a crook in order to devise such a wonderfully twisted and devious plot...What a fantastic storyteller.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Good action movie. Even more gooder (I kid, I know that's not a word) is that the character and the actions of Jack Reacher are pretty close to human. If he gets in a fight, he gets beat up and shows injuries (although he recovers pretty quickly). Aside from his photographic memory, his investigative powers aren't super human either. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Decent plot, plausible story line, good action.
0143124544|3.0|Call me critical or callous, but I found this book worth reading (as part of our book club fare), but I don't regard it as particularly memorable.  Good, but not Great literature.
B001XUT6AG|3.0|Weak plot with a couple of side trips that took way too long and added little to the plot.  Fine for a Prime video on a Sat--really glad I did pay theater prices
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Quality story line, acting. I loved this through and through.<br />It was really great seeing all the episodes at my convenience.<br />I cannot wait until this season..
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good wife is like reading a good mystery novel... One of those novels you just can't but down because you want to know what is going to happen next.  I think it is also a good character study.  And it shows how our choice effect/affect not only ourselves but our families and those around us.  The big thing is you can run but you can't hide.  We all find ways to mask the pain by filling our loneliness with of course on TV sex.  The faith part is played down and the sexual angle is highlighted how sad...the show makes it all look so easy which is not true in real life.  And how well adjusted the children come across...LOL.  I still liked the mystery the sense of hopefulness that it gives...that something good might happen.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good dialogue, interesting plot, NICE SUITS, pretty girls, nice bike...  WORTHY OF 5 STARS.  I can not wait for more.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I'm in my 40s and this book rings so true - I wish I could have had this years ago.  Although the playing field isn't level for women, we are often our worst enemy.  Excellent.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The play store might auto update this with the free version with ads, so make sure you turn off auto updates over there. This version has no ads no matter what has been said.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I fell in love with this game when i first played it on nintendo wii. I saw it on the app store and had to have it. Especially when its free!
0312360266|1.0|I felt like this story was completely butchered. I've always been a HUGE fan of the whole magical boarding school type of stories (Harry Potter, Vampire Academy) but this story just made me want to reach in and ring the main character Zoeys neck. I have NEVER read a story about a character that was so self righteous and close minded in my life. I would have enjoyed the story if she actually went through some hardships and had to grow up a bit but instead one gift after another is showered on her and she just turns up her pointy little nose at it, she really is the definition of spoiled brat. Not to mention she spends a huge portion of the book lecturing us on what we should believe in like, how evil and wrong it is to have oral sex, or how her ex boyfriend is a complete loser because he's smoked pot. And maybe that would have been fine but then she goes on to bash RELIGIOUS PEOPLE! I couldn't find anything to like about this character. She completely ruined the whole book for me which was very disappointing because I was really excited about reading this book.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The descriptions of the London &#34;Blitz&#34; were a reminder of how tough the Brits were during this terrible time. The twists and turns of the plot kept me guessing until the last chapter. A good book club selection.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book started slowly and awkwardly for me, feeding out little pieces of the story in too-quick jumps between point of view, and often feeling repetitive in the set-up details. It's now, on this side of the all said and done that I realize how perfect it was that I fell in love with Eleanor and Park a little at a time. I was in it before I realized what happened and what changed.<br /><br />I read about 90% of this book with a little knot in my stomach, knowing that things weren't going to be easy, or end neatly. They didn't, but I don't regret meeting Eleanor or Park. In their story was reflected some feelings I'm sure I've felt before-- insecurity, first love, sticking out, the odd man out of a family.<br /><br />The main charm of this book is in it's plain and simple relatability. We may not all have been picked on in high school, but maybe we have had our hand held by someone who made it tingle all over. It's such a simple, straight forward story, it sounds like something that could've happened to you or a friend or a friend of a friend.<br /><br />The characters were vivid and lovable. The story, both easy to get through and just a little tough to swallow. It's a little gem of a contemporary YA/romance book and I'm glad I gave it a chance. I spent a good amount of time at the end imagining all sorts of three word sentences.<br /><br />I love you.<br />I miss you.<br />Park, please stop.<br />All is well.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I'd been meaning to read this book for quite some time. After multiple recommendations I finally read it at a time that was quite relevant. It carries a beautiful message about following your calling and that he wonderful things that can come with it. Inspiring.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|You have to read over half of the book to even get a story line pick up. I will not be reading the next. Enough detail sex. WE GET IT!!!!. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE STORY LINE. First two were good..that's why I wanted to read the last...So I thought. Awful third book.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Nothing To Envy fascinated me because it was about regular people who were living in North Korea in homes rather than as prisoners in camps.  They were just living their lives and supporting their country until they just could not continue to do so.  I could not put this book down.  The author is a journalist who knew how to weave the facts into a compelling book.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|The MISTBORN series has believable characters that remain consistent throughout the story line.  Well written and extremely enjoyable to read.  Makes me realise that the beauty of this earth needs to be appreciated and loved.
0307341577|1.0|I had just read Gone Girl and enjoyed it so much that when I saw Dark Places in a book store, I bought it.  Big mistake.  I had trouble getting through this book. There are only two likeable characters: the mother and her sister.  Most of the others are dishonest, disgusting and just plain vile. Halfway through the book I really didn't care who dunnit. I can't believe this book has so many good reviews.  Gone Girl I could not put down.  Dark Places I had trouble picking up.  I would read a chapter or two and not be interested enough to read the next one. It took me 2 weeks to get through this piece of garbage.  Why did I keep reading?  At first I kept hoping it would get better and then I guess I got stubborn and wanted to see how it ended.  That was the best part of the book: IT ENDED.
1428144331|4.0|Very interesting and well told story. Certainly, the storyline and some particular scenes are very disturbing for various reasons, but I think the author is making the point that parents can't ignore these things.<br /><br />The book probably would have been 5 stars, but I listed to it on CD. The reader was fairly monotone and had the absolute worst voice for males. I kept thinking that all of her male characters had bronchitis.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|One of the most visually stunning movies I've seen in a long time - if you love good design and beautiful cinematography, this movie is worth your time alone.  It does however tend to be a bit over complicated and doesn't have quite the narrative conclusion that satisfies.  But in a field of average summer blockbusters, this one is sure to delight.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show! This is a drama that has it all, without all the indecency that comes with a lot of shows nowadays. I love UK dramas.
B00005JPSM|5.0|Fun romantic chic flick - really like the characters - good if you just want to sit and watch a nice movie.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|My husband plays it more than I do. He loves it. I think it's ok. I don't really play much.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is dynamic and really captures your attention from the moment you press play. My husband and I watched the while season in just two sittings!!! Great new concept in the lawyer genre. Enjoy!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I've really enjoyed my t ok me with Dragon story! If you have patience you can, essentially, obtain everything without spending a dime. Your neighbors can send you hold daily and one you have enough dragons obtaining gold is quick.<br /><br />The game does require patience, though. Many tasks require lots of hours fir things to happen. It's one of those games your meant to check on every hour or so for club collecting but rarely for progression.<br /><br />If you understand this, you will love it. :)
B00BYISQTO|5.0|At first I didn't love this album as much as their previous ones.  After a few listens and then going to see them live I couldn't get the songs out of my head. Absolute must have album.
0061726834|5.0|This is a wonderful series for teens.  The first two books of the series, keeps them interested and wanting to read more.  However, the ending in the THIRD book is not expected and leaves the reader unsatisfied and disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My grandson has this game on his Ipad. We play it together and are having fun.  Good game. When you don't have enough coins you can sell a prize for extra but being patient is better.
B003F46RVO|4.0|A movie that is filmed in a local California town. The story line is good , the acting is ok. Some young actors that are still around in showbiz. An entertaining and good movie to sit down with a bowl of popcorn. But overall it is a worthy movie to watch. Though there are some cheesy looking vampires in the end. I will watch it again.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I love this movie, it's hysterical and surprisingly well-made, puts the Blair Witch Project to absolute shame. The movie is not dubbed in English, instead using the original Norwegian audio with English subtitles (which in my opinion is the right way to go). Had it been dubbed in English, I imagine a lot of the humor and culture would have been lost in translation.<br /><br />I don't usually suggest buying movies before you see them, but any fan of dry comedy and mockumentaries will surely want this title in their collection. Two thumbs way up!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|WE LOVED IT!  WE ARE JUST WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR SEASON 3 AVAILABILITY!  I AM ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT BOOK IN THE SERIES.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Based on the lead single 'thrift shop' was the reason why it took me so long to buy it. Album ended up being very lyrical with nice beats. A must listen for those who love that classic 90s sound.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent read I'm so happy I read about the book on times books to readi wasn't sure if I would like a book without one of my friends recommending it. But I made a great decision
B007SSEZNA|1.0|I made the mistake of watching this version after watching the BBC 2009 adaptation of Emma.  Personally, I felt the characters lacked the warmth and emotional connection to each other and found this version of Emma shallow and whiny....  overall, I would not rent this movie again.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Not a bad game all round. I don't buy any add ons so no worries about cost. For what it is it's actually a pretty good game.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the book.  It was beautifully done and I felt there was a wonderful chemistry among the cast.  Would happily watch it again and again.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I like it how it changes the price minutes latter so it is not so expensive it is really fun u can go to ur freands town and it is really fun
B003TOMAPC|5.0|KIck ass is one of my favorite movies.  It is violent , funny, and action packed.  Nicholis Cage's and Chloe Mortez's perfomance was nothing short of amazing.  If you like this one I would strongly suggest you go see Kick Ass 2 in the theatres.  It is just as good as the first one, maybe even better.  If that is possible.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Really good book great for learning. And great for English to.I read it every time I need it .great.<br />And awesome.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|I am watching the whole TNG series in order. This show is cheesy but definitely a  classic. I like the strong female characters and frequent comedic relief.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Slow start, but once they reached the Capitol, I couldn't put the book down.  I really enjoyed reading this and look forward to book 2.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I wanted to replace the tapes and was happy to find it on DVD. We use it in our classrooms.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Works very well and easy to figure out. wish there were more settings to change the look and feel of it, but its free so I can't really complain.
6303965415|5.0|A beautiful atmospheric rendition of Jane Austen's work.  Compellingly beautiful music impels the story line.  A pleasure that costuming seemed much more in keeping with the modest style of the times than is usually the case in costume productions, where one is typically subjected to the vulgar tastes of producers.  Perfect casting in all parts, acting, set design, lighting, a joy to watch. One is only sorry it has to end.  I agree completely with the reviewer though who pointed out that the rather grotesque carnival scene and music totally destroyed the moment when the two main characters finally resolve their differences.  Also, too bad directors think we can't live without an overdone kissing scene.  Not one of Jane Austen's novels has such a thing. Would have been nicer to include the compelling passage from the book instead, where the hero/heroine discuss their past misunderstandings while walking home in a blur of joy.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This set came to me in wonderful condition. We haven't started the season yet but there is no doubt the DVDs will work perfectly.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I love this book. Wrapped around me in an odd mix of suspense, mystery and the unconditional love of a mother that I would have never thought it possible to know or understand, not having been a mother and slightly fearful of that responsibility. But Luptons characters reveal it all and it all unfolds beautifully without being sappy or contrite.
B005HED08I|5.0|Watching these again after many years; can't actually say that I appreciate that they have been remastered, but they are still great. Just don't compare them to the later Star Trek series :-)
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Wonderful movie, my grandchildren enjoyed it very much. Great music, lovely story, beautiful colors. I could watch it more than once
B003G4W49C|5.0|He loved it; couldn't put it down. Best science fiction ever!  We bought the second one but he was not as excited.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Kept me thinking through to the end.  Reacher is a tough but human hero.  Will read all the Reacher books
B00E3RFKMY|5.0|Extremely creative application of the violin for a very diverse collection of music.  David Garrett uses the Violin as if he was born with it in his hands.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome 3d realistic game. I love it and hope you will buy it and love it just as much as I do!!!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|After viewing the movie for the first time, I found all the books in the library and read them.  I have no problem with the movie.  Hey its Hollywood.  I have watched this movie maybe 10 times, I just love the story.<br /><br />Disney just really failed with this movie in marketing.  I just do not understand why it did not make more money.  Critics attacked it, and viewers loved it.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch was a perfect John Carter in every way.  Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris was disappointing.  It was not here acting, it just was not the Dejah Thoris you read about and how she was depicted in drawing on the novels.  Lynn Collins is attractive, but Dejah Thoris should have me more voluptuous ( provocative and sexually alluring, esp through shapeliness or fullness a voluptuous woman).<br /><br />I loved the technology behind the picture, and how they changed the story from the book.  They caught the essence of John Carter.  The script was perfect, in my opinion.<br /><br />Maybe Netflix or someone will do a series.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch was so impressive as an actor, I looked up his previous works and watched all of \\"Friday Night Lights\\" - The TV series.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Other than having to limit playing time nothing wrong with game app. Son asked to have this so he could play with his cousins and he is loving it.
B00CFNUMD0|3.0|I don't know but there's something about the changes they made in the animation, I liked season 1 way better.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|This is by far one of the best Mafia movies by the master Martin Scorsese, I dont need to say anything more because its a classic and this kind of entertainment sells itself...enjoy!!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This application has many options to configure it. You can set up as you like it.<br />I was using swype for a long time and I liked it very much. Now I am trying to test SwiftKey and I have to say that it is very, very similar  as Swype.
1451683405|4.0|There is really nothing new here in this centuries (millenia?) old dispute reagarding free will.  But this is exceptionally well written and well argued.  And not just the neuro science part.  It's the subjective argument that's reallygood.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I've enjoyed Mumford & Sons for a while, but I only recently purchased their newest CD, Babel. I love it. It's great music for background music while I work or for singing along to in the car.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|What a superb description of what family means and who is in it. The narrative is well- thought out--a delight to read!
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This was a really interesting movie. Not the usual. Really unique story with a lot to think about. Its not a chick flick at all. But your girl will like it too. So if you want a good scifi you both can watch give this one a try.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love downton abbey.  I am truly looking forward to the 4 th season.  Our can't get here soon enough.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am learning and when I get through with one reading, then I will start over with reading and then actually doing what she suggests with my manuscript. Her directions are easy to understand and follow one to the other. You are going to need Word 2007 on your computer. I have not worked with this program much, but the author gives perfect and easy to follow directions. I could not even begin without this book.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Read all the 1 star ratings for this book. They're all true. It is a horribly boring, pointless book with naked children running around everywhere.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This was a good app. I could play it FOREVER! You should totally get this wonderful app. I LOVE IT!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Good cast in a movie that makes you wonder what if? Emily Blount is an absolute baby doll in any role.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I read the book and really enjoyed this rendition of the story. Definitely NOT an action packed film, more of a drama. The Host is slow moving and may not be a movie everyone enjoys. I feel fans of the book will appreciate it as well as how true to the book the storyline is. Well done!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This compares to most &#34;feel good&#34; movies.  It does so in the most basic and natural form - from the fairy tales of our youth.  It gives plenty of character development, within the story plot,  without becoming unduely complex or preachy.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I was totally hooked , I would stay up all night reading it and could never stop. It was an epic book  each chapter was a cliff hanger. A REAL PAGE TURNER , YOU'LL LOVE IT!! =D
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|This was more enjoyable than Promethius, but both suffered from the egos of their executive producers.  This star trek played stupidly with plotting from the original movies.  Promethius was just another damn alien movie.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|My kids got this on their Wii years ago and when I saw it on the Amazon app store,I knew I had to have it. Excellent gameplay. No crashing, great story line.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Love the Avengers! They could have made Hawk's character a little better but oh we'll? Technology is great right now to be able to see the Incredible Hulk smash things the way he did.
B00280LYHS|5.0|When I started reading the book, I thought it would end differently. But ironically, I like  how it actually did end better. The part about Rachel being the Oracle? Pretty unpredictable. Overall, I love all of these book, my favorite so far. But who knows? The seven are yet to come!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Loved the movie and now the creators of the film brought the concept into a series.  Gives us more time to enjoy and loath the characters.
B005ZUR724|2.0|fun game for the early stages.  but everything that would cost large amounts of gold in Wow cost alternative currency. Want a mount? thats extra.  more than 3 character slots? thats extra. There aare only 4 character classes! why not give us 4 slots?? instead it costs another few bucks cor more character slots. and the spam! your chat window always is being spammed  y who won what from what lottey. and everyone gets 1 free dailg lottery.  that means every  haracter who logs in spams the entore game world with &quot;soandsovuy vot Purple Item from thrle lottey! You should play too!<br /><br />i dont know if the pay wall becoms a soft or hard wall later on, but the annoyan e of lottry spam deztroys any hope of this game to have a community.  it is impossible to chat on mobiles or tablets when the chat channel is owned by gameloft for useless promotion of additional pay product
B002JXK5VU|2.0|watch only if you are a sci-fi fan.  gave it the 3-episode try and could not find many redeeming factors.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is my second streaming device that I have tried and this one is not too bad. It works with my laptop, my android phone and android tablet without any problems. I use it for Netflix movies, I tried to stream from internet sites that have videos and some worked and some did not. I tried to watch The Big Bang Theory on the CBS site but for some reason the quality from laptop to TV was bad and the voice was delayed. My android tablet is a Coby so it does not allow the chromecast app, but no problem there is another app that works very well called aircast. All in all, with hopes for futures enhancements very much worth the $35.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This was a waste of time and effort. I would not recommend it at all. Online help videos a million times more useful. Its been deleted from my device.
B00821PCJS|5.0|i started watching this show and i seriously could not stop watching ... thank goodness i had multiple seasons to watch so i could watch one after the other.<br /><br />excellent show.
B000FC12Z0|4.0|The plot in this one was a bit thin: How could the murderer, after apparently being shot,  locate the &#34;lost gun&#34;, sprint to his wife's room, shoot her and imprint a mark on the wall, sprint back to the shooting room, and shoot himself in the leg in a matter of minutes.  And nobody saw him. Sounds a bit implausible to .me
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Great show. Really gives you a great insight into hannibals relationship with will graham prior to the red dragon and silence of the lamb books
B00CATONCA|1.0|The show is awesome but I couldn't be more disappointed with the floating head case. The screws are so flimsy and cheap they strip almost immediately also the lights on my case won't work despite trying several different batteries. Definitely going to be returned.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I like the HBO show, but I had read the books before the show began, and after watching the show, reread the books. You're going to want to read all of them, so get this set and you'll have all that exists presently.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I like the pictures. The story flowed well and was captivating blend of modern and past. Will read next book
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Very few features....limited ring tones. I probably won't even use the app because it is so limited.  look for a better one before purchasing.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Love it! My two year old son LOVES all the toy story movies. He even sleeps with his Buzz and Woody toys. The toy story movies are the only movies he's ever seen that he actually sits down and watches.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Liked the book.  Wish I had started a family tree because there are so many family members that it was hard to keep track of them.  Well written and never a down side to the story.  It kept my interest and I enjoyed the story line.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I accidentally downloaded this thinking it was the actual game and I have never played candy crush before and probably never will.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|i am totally hooked on jack reacher. After watching the movie. I had to read the books. now I am on book number 8. but he is my hero. I can't wait for more movie to come out. from the books.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love checking my email and this cuts time out from having to long onto my computer to check my emails and update my contact folders.
B000FC146C|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book, and I again enjoyed every bit of it. The story and the characters come to life on every page. The story is so unusual and so emotional that you cannot help but be drawn in. A must read for anyone who enjoys reading and enjoys watching history and its impact on life.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|So glad I found me a alarm clock that really can wake me up!!! I will tell everyone about this app
B000F4RHB6|4.0|Great kickin Music, A bit of Hard rock and a bit of Soul, rhythm and Blues, Great Fun! Am enjoying.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this great app called facebook it's so fun because you can talk with ppl with out being with them
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I love my new George Forman grill! Now I can eat what I love in a health way! Hurray!!! Adventure!
0307010856|5.0|Great all time classic.  Purchased for a friends baby shower.  Came quickly and in pristine condition.  Very Happy, thank you!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really fun but 10 levels isn't enough. hope they add more soon!! looking forward to more challenges in the nearrrrr future.
B007SSF3O0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It is a fun, light movie. I would watch this movie again. This is a great girls night movie.
1586210912|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. I gave the listener a different perspective on what is and what is not important to retain your finances.
B003MS7V8G|3.0|This movie was okay. I would not watch this movie again. This movie is very simple. Not much to it at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got this game cause of 100 floors. It's a ok game just needs more levels. I like that it's a game that makes you think.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|wonderful story--waiting for next season to start  worth waiting for  the cast is wonderful also  what more can I say
0316044695|4.0|This is one of those books that you just can't put down.  It's a great read and keeps you interested from beginning to end.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very well written and insightful!  The fact this book is written by a neurosurgeon gives more credibility to the proof of heaven and after-life.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie actually shocked me.  I was not expecting something on the order of a masterpiece when I purchased this film.  There are multiple twists and a great, unique story here.  It's something special.  I watched it with my kids and they were able to mostly follow it and after a bit of explaining got the concept.  This is something to not miss if you enjoy anything from the sci-fi side of things.  Again, a must watch and a great buy.  This is in my top 5 sci fi flicks with actual stories of all time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next novel!!! I read all the ones that are out in about 3 days... Couldn't stop!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's addicting and fun, and even my little nephew can play it. It's one of those games that you get better at it the more you play, even for someone like me isn't good at video games.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A great read.Well written. A great mix of characters<br /> Loved how these characters lived separate lives yet were so interlinked. Author managed to draw everything together so skilfully. Best book I've read in a long time.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, just like all of the star treck movies and you will to!!! So buy this flick\!
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Great game that makes you think for hours great eye hand coordination game . Great game for all ages to play
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|This movie is okay but it not like the first,for it like another add on to the series,but you might like it!!
B001TH16DS|5.0|What can you anyone say that has not been said already? Forgeting about a episode review per say, the service was fast and great! My blurays arrived earlier than expected. The quality of the set is top notch, and the value (33 bucks for a new season!) was unbeatable! Amazon has done it again!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This movie bring all of the action heros together for a battle with a foe that you think is unbeatable
B00DP3IESY|3.0|Very impressive sets and scenery but a weak story. We bought it even though we saw it at the theater mainly because it was cheap and came with a free Amazonnversion.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I am sure you will like this movie if you enjoy action flix. Just another one in the series of the great hero movie, we all wish we had.
B0015AARJI|5.0|its a sony licensed product. great price for what everyone else had their controllers at at that time...so i bought...great find for me...thank you
B008VIKLWA|4.0|Another Disney great works. I enjoyed this flick, no for everyone,but if you like chimpanzees you will like this one.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I'm intrigued by Gaiman and his ability to spin a yarn. I love great writing and I love a great story especially if I can't predict where the author is going. I'm not sure I'm ready to call him the new Bradbury but I'll definitely read more of his stuff.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I'm no treki but this movie as well as the first has made me reconsider... ;)<br /><br />All I can say is, well done!
B004EF8AJA|5.0|It was a moving, enjoyable film set during a tumultuous time in Britain's history. Great character development and a believable romance that had you cheering for the characters to win.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Remember the movie &#34;JAWS&#34;....it really made everyone feel how it was like in deep dark waters and with a great white shark right there.....that was so real, it didn't make you want to swim out into the sea at all.  Well, I never saw a movie so real about a tsunami.  This movie made you experience those uncontrollable huge waves, as if you were there, sinking, struggling, trying to survive this horrifying ordeal, trying to live - - this was such a terrifying, touching, moving movie about the lives of those affected by the 2004 Thailand tsunami.  From beginning to end, it just holds your attention...can't blink an eye at all.  Amazing movie making - so real, so heartfelt.  I've seen it twice and still feel the same.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is an amazing series. Love the realistic take on the era. You fall in love with all the characters
140006922X|4.0|Great historical view of the early Christian Era. An Ideal book if you don't have a knowledge background of the historical Jesus.
B001AQO3XS|4.0|really like the first one and got it fast but the quality wasn't much better than the dvd but it  will do
0393338398|5.0|I think baseball fans,fans of other sports, quants, and people that love a great story will all love this book. This book is a real eye opener on how to use quantitative analysis of statistics to unearth what really makes all the difference in winning baseball games as cheaply as possible. It is an interesting story stretching back to one of the original creators of sabermetrics Bill James all the way to John W. Henry the owner of the Red Sox that used sabermetrics to finally break the curse of the Bambino by winning the world series.<br /><br />What the nerds and bean counters outside baseball saw that the baseball insiders could not was that what made all the difference in winning and losing baseball games was not what the 'old boys club' thought it was. The results of baseball games came down to runs and runs were a result of getting on base. The most important statistic then was \\"on base percentage\\" that is what put a team in scoring position and to even have the valued 'Runs batted in' or RBIs that were so highly valued but misunderstood. How did a player get on base? Patience and waiting for the right pitch greatly increased the players chance of getting on the base and there was no shame in walking to get there. The much loved stealing bases and defensive fielding were not really what made all the difference when it came down to the statistics.<br /><br />This book is the story of how the colorful general manager of the Oakland A's with his limited budget and understanding of his own failures during his big league career used quantitative statistical analysis and his Harvard sidekick to get the most bang for their bucks by making better decisions than other ball clubs. In the draft each year they chose college players over high school players due to high school players failure and wash out rates, they were not gamblers they were going for the best odds of success on their draftees. They would take players they believed were under valued and trade players when they began to cost more than they believed they were worth. Paul Depodesta broke down the A's season into how many runs they had to get to make the playoffs and went in search of how to build a team that could give them that many runs. When they lost key players to free agency they would replace that players contribution to the team with mulitple players that together would have the same strengths as the one they lost.<br /><br />The Oakland A's consistently finished in the top of their division even with much smaller payrolls and would routinely make the play offs. The also set a record at one time of 20 straight wins in a row.<br /><br />One of my favorite books ever,entertaining, a great story, great characters, paradigm changer, fun to read and could give you ideas on how to think about what is really the most important thing in your own field of expertise or business that will make all the difference in results.they began to cost more than they believed they were worth.

B004T4LUPW|2.0|They need the redo the app again. It has the ugly ginger bread zoom button. Also it had the GB UI all over. They need to redo the app to the Holo design guide lines.
B0058VW36U|4.0|When I saw the image for this game, it looked like a kid's app. Since it appeared to be a puzzle game I decided to give it a quick look. Well, the quick look turned into a quick hook. Delivering candy to the little monster via cutting ropes, swinging ropes, and bubble lifts is quite entertaining and challenging.<br /><br />I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and had no issues with the game.<br /><br />My wife and I both played and enjoyed the game, She's sitting with my Fire, several levels in, and a crease in her brow on her current level. LOL<br /><br />Make the candy hit all the stars for the best score, and that can be hard to figure out how to do in some cases.<br /><br />I dock the game a VERY BIG STAR because it does intrude at times with ads to buy super- powers for extra cash, and also because it DOES try to get you to buy super-powers for extra cash. I hate the extra cash games, and I almost docked two stars for that reason. However, the puzzles were so interesting that I left it at four. I am not sure, but I suspect that there are puzzles where you may not be able to hit all the stars on the screen without purchasing the powers.<br /><br />I'll just miss some bonus points, because I'm not spending extra cash for super-powers.<br /><br />This is one of the few free apps of the day games I've tried so far that I'm tempted to return to after a few plays.<br /><br />It's also very cute to watch the little monster open wide with expectation as the candy gets near.<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book kept me riveted  Anxious to reach conclusions.  Characters were strong.  I liked the interconnections between characters.  A little far fetched
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|This movie is breathtaking. It is so beautiful. The story is so heartbreaking. Leonardo Dicaprio was fabulous. I thought it was a great adaptation.
0142410705|5.0|This is such an excellent book. Like all John Green books I couldn't put it down and finished it quickly.
0061122416|5.0|A simple story that opens to such complexity of the universe. Definitely a page turner, I totally loved this one
B00CWY76CC|4.0|GOOD brain teaser. Helps keep you focused &amp; keep an develop an eye for detail. A good way to pass the time. Highly recommend
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Yet another great book!!! Ending was just what I wanted!! I would highly recommended this book to almost anyone. Loved .
B005XN31LY|5.0|this is the best show yet. can't wait for it to start up again this season. don't want it stop airing
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is awesome. I recommend you download because I have no problem with it. Hope you enjoy it :).
B009AMANBA|1.0|I tried watching this movie THREE times. I could not stay awake! It's only my opinion but I found this almost the worst movie ever made. There is usually SOMETHING to hold my attention, but this.....zzzzzz.<br />EVERY time! Boring, way too long and those bits I DID see did absolutely nothing to hold my attention. Thank goodness I saw (some of) it on Netflix before I wasted my money.
B00BD07SGU|5.0|Great album by a great band, consistent, melodic and with just enough crunch to keep it interesting. Can't wait to see them play in Sydney in October.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|It's a sad story well written but at times it may be too graphic for a sensitive reader (ie me!).
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Always been a SW fan but I have been increasingly frustrated by the hit and miss nature of his last few offerings - the Incident, Grace for Drowning and Storm Corrosion - a reflection of him perhaps diluting his talents across too many projects. So I was not all that excited, but once I heard the title track I was drawn in and not disappointed. A masterly, complex and layered composition done by a fantastic group of musicians.
B003B02O14|5.0|As always this John Grisham novel is just great.  I couldn't stop reading.  I can't wait to read another one.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Great movie for adults and kids.  Johnny Depp is perfect as Rango.<br />Watched this movie several times and it never gets old.
B000001F95|5.0|Like another reviewer, I saw Cal when it came to a nearby independent theater (The Nickleodeon - The Columbia Film Society Theater).  I enjoyed the movie and was already a Mark Knopfler fan.  The music is brooding, evocative, melancholy, hopeful, sentimental and inspiring.  The album is fantastic and, if you are a Knopfler fan, indispensable to your appreciation of his talent.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. The puzzles really made you think and pay attention. It was challenging and I was enthralled the whole time. Gorgeous graphics and detailing.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|No real impact, but I love the play. I've seen it on the stage several times and wish I had been in London for this performance.
0694003611|5.0|This book is a book from my childhood. I was excited to find it to put in it in a collection for my children.
B00005JKED|4.0|Denzel Washington is good in whatever he plays in and this was excellent even if it was brutal.  I have watched it several times.
0394818237|5.0|This book is a book from my childhood. I was excited to find it to put in it in a collection for my children.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Denzel was great in this one too.  It was plausible and definitley possible that people like this do exist today.
B002GTZSZU|1.0|The director's cut turned one of my favorite movies into rubbish that I can't share with my kids until I'm comfortable with showing them nudity.  Why?  And Mozart's girlfried (the one who hits him with the roses on stage in the original version)-- well there is an absolutely terrible scene in which she confrots Mozart after the show in a thick California accent. It's so hard to watch I can't even believe it.  This is even worse than watching the new footage that George Lucas thrust upon us in Star Wars.  I was half expecting a scene in which Mozart walked across Jabba the Hutt's tail.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|The film is wonderful! I just feel sad I did not see it in theaters, especially IMAX. I was misled by the reviews and Universal did a poor job of promotion and explanation. The reality is this is a landmark film because, a) it's an original story without a predictable ending or middle, b) strong story and dialog--no teen characters in the way, c) great acting, d) great scenes, and e) inspiring music. That's about it unless you have been brainwashed by formula flicks at this point and still need rehashed stories and characters.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|this is an exxcellent release a few subtle differences. good to have another metal release out right now no need for other reviewers to rate so low they are just losers anyway.
B00C1S945G|5.0|I'm a Trekkie.  I love all the star trek series! I have a Roku3 hd so I can watch what I want with no commercials.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|this is one of the best cds of the year.sounds similar to thin lizzy but slightly different. awesome sound great songs good line up kicks ass
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This series is great and I have enjoyed watching them all again on blue ray. Everything is so much more clear and vivid watching in blue ray verses standard dvd. Not all movies are worth getting on blue ray but this is worth a little extra.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Geared more to teenager, it really did not keep my attention. I am thinking the sequel might be better. It was ok
030789701X|5.0|This book is fantastic. I tells everything and more. I can't imagine playing without it. Get this book and you won't regret it.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|The character of Data has always been one of my favorites. I was really on the edge of my seat and startled to read this story! Well done.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Powerful story of the difficult political environment in Afghanistan and the personal toll it takes on the lives of individuals and families.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|To me this app is so funny and i think i it deserves a five star rating. Rate this app five stars if you agree too. :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this because i am a college student and i am unable to go home to sharpen my utility knife on a regular basis. I bought this bec it was small and cheep. I love how well it worked as well as its size. Perfect Product!!!!
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|Have not been able to sit through even the first half of this.  It might be good once you get into it, but getting there....good grief.
B00DE76PM8|3.0|This does sound perfect for those of us (Ireland)in very rural locations and street signs are a rarity.  Google does not have many of these - we have tried to locate them! We really do need to locate ALL small lanes and offshoots as people/places are tucked away in all sorts of out-of-the way locations!<br />Also, Wi-Fi is extremely erratic all over Ireland, especially in rural areas and whilst travelling about (hills and various terrain difficulties). The strength of signal is erratic and even some rain seems to send signal for television, telephones , androids and computers into on/off modes.<br />I am concerned about automatic billing permission as I am not sure exactly what this means.  Does it mean money is taken automatically when I access the app? (every time I use it) Does it mean I am asked to pay AND ONCE ONLY PLEASE for a 'enabler' app in order to access information? If this is the case then what, precisely, of saying I have taken out a FREE app?<br />I have taken the two stars as this is not mentioned at all and can turn out to be costly, and not only that, there may be HIDDEN costs.  I most certainly take exception to that.<br />Having said that, I do feel this app is EXACTLY suited to our requirements and should like to use it when these 'niggles' are sorted out.  A good,detailed off wi-fi mapping system here is an essential part of the car equipment when meandering about in the South. The cities we visit are places where we get lost very quickly, both in the car and on foot.  It would be one of our best apps if we could sort out the above information.<br />I have the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch and rarely go out without without it and so it would be ideal as far as I can tell. I purchased the app but I feel unable to use it until I have this information.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I enjoy playing...it can be addictive..Not quite what I expected,, but I do like it..would buy a second version, if available..
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I have been using IP Cam viewer both paid and free for some time on my Samsung Note 2 phone and I find it to be an excellent piece of software that does exactly what i want. The paid version which is all of $3.99 doesn't have any adds whereas the free version does. It's worth the 4 bucks to have a clean piece of software but I must admitt the adds in the  free version weren't too bad. Currently I monitor 2 Foscam cameras both at home using Blue Iris software and IP cam viewer when on the road. I am still very impressed by how well the IP Cam viewer works for such a nominal price. My hats off to the author.  Since this is just one part  of  my home security system I have other software to compare it to and all I can say is it really holds its own. Also real time views from my Foscam cameras are very clear and crisp.
B009NNG202|3.0|I thought the depictions in this film was just too horrendous and gorey!! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone one to watch unless you want to learn more about the conditions in 17th Century Europe or unless you like gore!  It's okay in my opinion!
0385523394|5.0|I really enjoyed Piper's memoirs of her year in federal prison. It really opened my eyes to one aspect of the prison system. I watched the series on Netflix (which I love) and wanted to find out more. Really glad I grabbed the book on the way to vacation. It was a nice easy and entertaining read.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game if you like shooting. I'm very impressed with the graphics of this game. One bad thing is that you aren't able to talk to other players. Still five stars and a great game.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Big Bang Theory has been awesome, and season six is no exception. It's hysterical in all ways it must be, witty, smart, and while sometimes predictable, that predictability doesn't stop you from watching what comes next--it just makes that next punch line all the better.<br /><br />Wicked cool acting, writing, etc. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who likes comedy sitcoms.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book makes you really stop and think about why you are here. Science is not the answer to everything!
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|I've played many a board games and card games in my life and this one has less components than any other.  Despite that, it is quite fun.<br /><br />Likes:<br />The gameplay itself is very good.  Essentially each round consists of drawing and then playing one card from their hand.  They only ever keep one card in their hand so they're choosing between the card they had already and the one they've drawn.  At the end of the round the player with the highest card value in hand wins.  Pretty simple, right?  Well, not so much, as every card has an effect on it that must be acted out when discarded.  Most of them affect other players, but some affect you and can do bad things for you.  For example, the highest card is The Princess (#8).  You may think it's excellent to have this, however her 'effect' is that upon discarding her you are out of that round.  If other people deduce you have her they'll be looking to force you to discard.  It's not just about getting the best card, but getting the right card at the right time.  There's a fair amount of luck involved (i.e. the first six guards I drew in the first game we played were Guards (#1) spread across two rounds) but there's also a good amount of strategy and deduction.  It'll make you think without breaking your brain.  Plus a full game lasts about twenty minutes so it's not like your sitting there all day.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />Pleasantly none of my dislikes involve the actual game mechanics. Based on mechanics the game would get a 4.5 stars from me, but the following bring it down a bit -<br /><br />*Theme:  The theme is... Well a bit weird.  You're trying to get different peopl in the castle to deliver love letters to a princess.  Now the theme has little to no affect on the gameplay, but it is a bit odd.  It makes convincing a group of non-gamers to play tougher, especially since all of the components come in a deep red velvet puch labled &#34;Love Letter&#34; in gold scroll.  I don't hate the theme... But I think they could have used the same mechanics attached to something else.  It is worth noting, though, that this game is part of a 'series' by AEG and ties in thematically with three other games.  I have not played them so it is possible that doing so makes the theme of this more enjoyable.<br /><br />Components:  Like I said, the components come in a little pouch.  I like this - it's kind of clever as it ties in with the back story, it makes the game nice and portable, and the pouch is of good quality.  Again, though, it just looks a bit weird.  My wife was very confused when she saw it sitting on the table for the first time.  The cards themselves have very nice illustrations, but are very flimsy and require a good deal of care.  Card sleeves are a must for longevity.  The game doesn't cost much, but it only comes with 16 cards, some cubes, a rulebook, and the pouch, so I feel they could have been of a better quality.  The cubes used to keep score work fine, but again, they could be better - they're just red cubes.  Little hearts or something could have been just as cheap to make and tied in with the theme a bit more.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Love Letter gives you a lot of bang for your buck.  It's a great game to play if you're waiting for other players on your game night or if you just want something light that won't take to long.  It's simple enough to teach to new players and older children (though the illustrations are a bit provacative).<br /><br />I definitely recommend this game!!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I have always loved Train, and with this album...my love has grown even more.  The songs are funny, soulful, and this is a great cd.  Pat Monahan's voice is stellar...this just makes my day!!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought his Debut CD.  As much as I love his voice, I was disappointed by the lack of depth in his lyrics on &#34;Doo-wops&#34;.  I had thought I wouldn't buy his next CD.  However, I noticed that like &#34;Doo-wops&#34;, this CD was getting high ratings by the critics.  I took the plunge and bought it.  I love it.  I think it is amazing.  He has an amazing voice and I love him sharing his exploration around his relationship with sex as a 25 year old man.  I find his lyrics to be very authentic and heartfelt.
1401324649|5.0|This book is a feel-good book and constantly made me laugh. The autor has an amazing imagination and has created a story which covers a lot of the world's most &#34;hot&#34; topics over the last 100 year in a hilarious way. Anyone who feels like reading a wonderful story and get some good laughs - read this book!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have all of Taylor Swift's CD's.  I was apprehensive about getting this one because I was a little turned off by her personality in the past 6 to 9 months.  I finally gave in and bought the CD.  I love it!  I just think she is a great singer/ songwriter.  I find her lyrics to be very authentic.  As a poet myself, I very much appreciate that.<br /><br />I guess this is a case of separating the artist from their art.  I like her art.  However, sometimes the artist behind the art can be irritating.  I was disappointed when she was so caustic and disparaging about the inspiration behind &#34;I Knew You Were Trouble&#34; when accepting the VMA.  But then again, she is only 22.  Hopefully over time she can carry herself in a different manner.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Other retailers have 30 minutes of content that is not available elsewhere.<br />And iTunes is the only source for filmmaker commentary.<br /><br />I have cancelled my pre-order.<br /><br />Amazon: insist on a complete release. I don't care how cheap your version is, I won't buy anything missing that much content.<br /><br />Paramount: quit playing favorites and double-dipping games. I will not run out and pay more to some specific retailer, nor will I \\"collect them all.\\" I will not mix-and-match media either.<br /><br />Jerk me around and I won't buy anything. I doubt I'm alone in feeling this way.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written about a real occurrence I had not known about.  Interesting concept of &#34;portaging&#34;. I am thinking of it in my own life journey.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|You will laugh. You will cry. This book is incredibly well-written and a phenomenally told story. I will recommend this book to every reader I meet for the rest of my life!!!
B007MJSSCY|4.0|There's nothing about this movie I didn't like. The actors were great, the story was captivating and engaging, the themes were touching. The theme that we are all indebted to our forebears and they are with us in spirit is comforting and well handled.<br />I thought it was very original and smart.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY,  THINK I HAVE IT FIGURED OUT AND END UP AT BEGINNING AND FIND NO INSTRUCITONS
B007SGM084|5.0|This was by far the BEST trilogy series that I've read so far!!! I absolutely LOVED it. I couldn't get my eyes out of it. I couldn't put it down or get enough of it. I just finished the entire series and now I just seem lost, I want more.
B000MR1V22|5.0|A refreshing comedy that follows a family in a beauty pageant. Filled with awkward scenarios that are all too similar to real life, the movie brings refreshing realism to the big screen.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Lot of questions still not answered, frustratingly, but not a dull moment! I can't wait to read the final book!
B003I55BIA|5.0|This was the most romantic good novel I have ever read besides Twilight. A little too much cursing but I still gave it a 5 star for a reason! :)
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My two sons thought this movie was a fun telling of a superhero tale.  They love all the lego movies, but this has been their favorite one so far.  They want more.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|spent several minutes trying to figure out how to play this game without success. the directions are minimal.  finally deleted the app.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is a good read in my opinion.  Not as good as &#34;Gone Girl,&#34; but a good read none the less.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|easy to use, to buy, and to pick up a book when I have a few minutes with nothing at hand but my phone...
B006Y9BULE|4.0|I love this watch! I've been looking for a rolex submariner styled watch. The links are a pain to change so i ended up taking it to a jeweler.<br />The only bad part was waiting a full week for the seller to send it, then I waited another week for the shipping company. I used Amazons free shipping so I'm not complaining about shipping. So it took 2 weeks to get a watch from arizona to Houston Tx.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I absolutely love this album and have found, by sharing the ones I have, that this is most universally liked. I think that t duets make is appealing as well as the songs from musicals that most people have heard throughout their lives. A beautiful recording by a beautifuly woman with a fantastic voice!
B001NLKZUA|2.0|Clary,so far,doesn't seem to have read or studied any books.Simon is the one I find interesting so far.<br />I find it a little weird how Jace loves Clary when they're sister and brother,it's really weird.And Magnus liking Alec?!I really like Magnus,he's very interesting but I didn't get why I didn't see much from his perspective .The book was a bit boring in my opinion.<br />And Clary avoids Jace because she's punishing herself ?But Jace,apparently,can't stop thinking of Clary,his sister,who he loves in the wrong way but he can't give it a rest.It's gross how he thinks like that .<br />But at least the first few chapters were ...okay.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I gave this three stars because it's easier to get on Twitter on-line to access Twitter.  I get on Twitter quicker with my Kindle Fire.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|An addictive series ,historical period piece,starting pre World war one untill several years after the war,it deals with the breaking down of social barriers and the women's struggle to return to post war duties.A great story of the changes in both above stairs and below stairs lives.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who appreciates good ole style country music.  Had heard Vince Gill talking about the making of this CD and he was right- on all the way.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I thought this movie was very modern and covered many aspects of ones life.  Parents coping with teenagers who are on drugs, not being able to communicate with teenagers, learning not to judge a person by their outward appearance, being in a marriage where one party is having an affair and friends know but the the other party is always last to find out, coping with aging parents with a mental disability, coping with a partner, parent, child dying seeing a tunnel vision view of their lives.  How different members of a family see money and inheritance.<br />This film has it all, well acted.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I like some of the songs on  the CD.  However, there are a few which I skip over when I listen to this CD.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I just don't like any of the people in it. She's a needy manipulator and he's a spoiled self absorbed twit. I can't really care about them or anything that happens. Waste of time in my opinion.<br /><br />UPDATE - OK, I finished it and gave it one more star. It is a strange story, and the ending is still in question. I still don't like any of the people in it - except maybe the twin sister.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|It won't let me connect to FB and it loses connection which in turn loses what I was doing or it says it needs to refresh and loses all my progress please fix!!
140006922X|4.0|This was a really good book. Reza packs it with all his years of study and research. I learned so much about the life and times of this prophet; he backs up everything he says with documents in many languages that we will probably never see ourselves.  He has stripped away the myths and shown us the man and the times he lived in.  This is a very factual book, and I sometimes had to reread passages, as I've been away from the intellectual scene for many years. This is an important book, that people of all belief systems should read.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really love this mahjong game.  I play this on my phone all the time.  it is a quick game and has a lot of screens to play.
B00CATONCA|4.0|So I got my Walking Dead Season 3 Limited Edition BluRay in the mail today.<br /><br />I was excited to see how this sucker looks put together so I unboxed it. I decided first thing to slide the BluRay disc hardbook part into the back of the head case. Bad idea...<br /><br />People, DO NOT slide your movies in there if you are a collector and like your items pristine. It was a bit tough to get out for one (I had to pull from both top and bottom to finally get it to slide out). BUT, the worse part is a major design flaw - at least for collectors. There are 2 little rounded tabs that are indented on the back of the container (inside) that are meant to hold the BluRay hardbook in place tighter. Only problem is, when you slide the movie out, you're left with a gouge / indented line running across the front of your nice BluRay hardbook. Not good at ALL :(<br /><br />I found this out the hard way, so I hope you read this in advance of getting yours.<br /><br />I saw a lot of people complaining about the screw on the bottom. Mine came out fine using my small head phillips screwdriver. I also have no problem with the set itself - it's your typical hard plastic/vinyl \\"toy\\" setup (which is what I expected) but it looks pretty cool once the water is in and lights are on. I do worry that the button used to turn the lights on (the \\"3\\" on the front logo) will wear out/break over time - crossing fingers on that. The instructions (on the inside of the hardbook) state that the heads can go on in any place. This is not true. The hangars on the back of each head are offset according to the position they go in the water case, so pay attention to that when you are putting the heads in there.<br /><br />All in all, I like it - just wish I had seen those 2 indented tabs before sliding my movie in. They are are not really necessary since the set will more than likely be sitting on a shelf.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I liked the book because it was less graphic and over the top than the Netflix series. Good easy beach/vacation read. Didn't require much thought or concentration. Disappointed that I could not loan this book out but that seems to be the case with any book you purchase from amazon which is popular; lend is not an option.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book is dark an deep, full of symbol and meaning, yet a beautifully written story line. Believe me when I say you won't be able to put it down. This is the kind of book that stays with you, completely engrossing.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I hate horror...so I didn't start watching this until well into the season. Once I watched one...I was hooked. Very well done.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|No big deal, really. Provides access to Twitter account on my kindle. No muss, no fuss.<br />I recommend this app.
B0058RN85O|5.0|Modern Family is one of the best comedies airing on tv today. Hilarious and moving. Ty Burrell as Phil Dunphy steals the show in my opinion. Must see if you are one of the few who have yet to watch this modern classic.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|The link connecting it to my Facebook broke, so I can't play from my smartphone anymore- it simply won't open the program. Other than that, it's been a fun game.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Was torn between this and the SB-910. Was not adequately convinced that the 910 was worth the extra cost, weight, and dimension.
1881273377|5.0|This audio CD is great!  I am telling everyone I know to get it.  I feel like anyone that is in a long term relationship and wants it to last forever should listen to this CD.  Even if you think your relationship is perfect this can only make it better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are no words to describe how much I love this book. It has changed the way I look at life and made me cry a few times. Absolutely brilliant.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show.  I was told I would probably like it, but never had time to watch when it aired on TV.  I watched all 3 seasons in 3 weeks over the summer!  I could not stop watching and stayed up late after putting the children to bed (often to watch 3-4 episodes in one night).  I cannot wait until the new season begins in October!  It cannot come soon enough.  I will make time to watch!

B00A27X972|5.0|I cannot comment better than the other reviews. I gobbled this book down. It did not get boring for me. I am going to cruise through it again to write down the wonderful quotes and meaningful things he started out with on each chapter. I do hope for a movie of The Humans.

B008S6959A|4.0|I've heard a lot about Avantasia but never bought one of their albums until now. The Scarecrow seemed like a good starting point and, overall, it's a good album. There are some incredible, some of the best I've ever heard, type songs mixed in with some odd songs that I didn't really get.<br /><br />The amazing:<br /><br />1. Twisted Mind - awesome song from the very beginning. As with other greats on this album, the mixture of a huge chorus, amazing vocals, and great music is all here.<br />2. The Scarecrow - maybe one of my favorite songs of all time. This has everything! From it's folky beginning to it's rockin' end, I don't think I could ever get enough. Again, that chorus. My god. And then the switch up to a harder sound as the song progresses is everything I love about it. Classic.<br />3. The Toy Master - another masterpiece. It starts off slow, then builds, switches up, and explodes into a mixture of awesome!<br /><br />There are other great songs on the album (namely &#34;Another Angel Down&#34; and &#34;Devil in the Belfry&#34;) but there's also a few that's aren't so great. There are three songs that stick out for me: &#34;Carry Me Over&#34;, &#34;What Kind of Love&#34;, and &#34;Cry Just a Little&#34;. The best of those three is &#34;What Kind of Love&#34;, but only because of the vocals. Otherwise, these are songs I definitely skip.<br /><br />But overall, really enjoy this album.

B0058YPL66|3.0|Good writing, good storytelling...too much time spend on romance and too much Evil Queen...  Looks like every episode, near the end, you see the evil queen...she is always at the right place at the right time. Ok for a few<br />episodes, but im really looking for better conclusions without the message that the evil queen knows all....its<br />getting repetitive. When will Emma wake up...come on ..she is getting hints and proof but still has a hard time<br />believing...why does'nt she bring a few characters past the town 's border etc.etc.etc.<br />Like i said ...the show will improve im sure...<br />So yes, im expecting this series to start respecting the audience with more intelligent writting....<br /><br />And after viewing the whole season,, it stays with a 3 star rating...its getting a little<br />better...and from what ive seen from season 2 ...it will get even better.<br />enjoy
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The game was lots of fun but I lost my coins real fast. Won't be spending any more of my money.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|Ms. Grisom has managed to entice her readers to immerse themselves in a wonderfully complicated period piece with her strong character development and talent for painting vivid images on our minds eye with her words.<br />Her book is well crafted and allows the reader to become enveloped and compelled to forge on to see what lies ahead in her intricate human drama.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves our rich American heritage, and wants to have the opportunity to visit the old south through the eyes of some very authentic  representations of the people that truly understood what it was like on both sides of the color divide.  Family comes in all shades and is irreplaceable!

B000000OAC|4.0|This record kicks off perfectly.  From the storm of We Will Rock You/We are the Champions through All Dead All Dead this record starts off right.  Get Down Make Love is their least interesting song ever and their most irritating.  That bring the entire record down a notch.  They redeem themselves with Sleeping on the Sidewalk which segues into Who Needs You.  This sounds like a collaboration between McCartney and Jimmy Buffet who sold the song to Queen and it really works.  Excellent song.  From there the record rocks.  They have always had this obsession with 1920s style music that sometimes works, sometimes does not.  Here on My Melancholy Blues it does and is a perfect closer to this record.<br /><br />4/5
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What an absolutely fantastic book!! I read it on vacation and could NOT put it down!! It poses questions and scenarios that make you question your own moral compass... How far would you go to protect your children? And in the end, are you actually helping or hurting? How much guilt can you live with? Who pays for your sins, you or your children?  LOVE IT!!
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I hate to say it, but so far the answer is no!!  I was very inspired by this book and there is a lot of valuable info for anyone wanting to do aquaponics.  One of the most valuable aspects in the long run is that there are links to many other online gurus in the book as well.<br />  I was totally inspired!!  The idea that one can help out the planet and eat more nurtritious foods and save money all at the same time is a no=brainer - especially if it's not technically too difficult.<br />  However, I am living in a small island in the Caribbean.  Great climate!  I cannot imagine how much more difficult it is for people in North America to make this work with seasonal changes like winter!  But today I experienced the failure of my overflow pipe and had to put my fish back into the pond by hand -exciting, but a real no-no! Of course, the type of monsoon rain we experience is not the norm either.<br />  Anyway, my point is - you have to be able to face reality!  most things that are worthwhile in life are not idiotically simple.  You have to be inspired enuf to keep going when the going gets tough.  I am committed to staying the course and I still hope that it becomes as easy as the book made it seem.<br />P.S. if you start small you may find it much easier to set up an Aquaponics system.  I elected to start with a 900 gallon pond because I wanted an excuse to have a real fish pond.  the flip side of this is that you can make a lot more mistakes and get away with it when you have a bigger pond with more surface area for the fish.  Also, i chose Tilapia - a very adaptable fish, lucky me!
140006922X|4.0|Aslan provides a highly readable synopsis of the current thinking of one school of scholarship, with which I agree.  He draws heavily on the ideas of Robert Eisenman (James the Brother of Jesus, The New Testament Code), without giving him and others adequate credit, I think.

1400069807|5.0|When the food industry talks about you, the consumer, they think of you as their \\"stomach share\\" and try to sweet talk you into eating more. Evidently they're succeeding, since two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese.<br /><br />The main way they do this is by cramming the most addictive food substance, sugar - which lights up your brain very much like cocaine - and also Fat and Salt, which are nearly as addictive.  These Big 3 ingredients in processed food are the main cause of the obesity and diabetes epidemic, as well as many of the early deaths from heart disease and stroke, hypertension, gall-bladder disease, osteoarthritis, breast cancer, colon cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />Addiction is a main theme in this book, since most people have no idea how addictive sugar, fat, and salt are.<br /><br />Processed food \\"drug dealers\\" spend an immense amount of money to get you addicted.  Frito-Lay has almost 500 chemists, psychologists, and technicians paid $30 million a year to do research to hook you on their products.  They even have a $40,000 machine that duplicates a chewing mouth to perfect their chips by finding the perfect break point (which is exactly 4 pounds of pressure per square inch).  Another 10,000 salesmen are making sure store shelves are well-stocked with their addictive wares (p 321).  Nestle's research team of 700 staff has 350 scientists and they also collaborate with other institutions (p 332).<br /><br />The biggest revelation of this book is that food processors can't lower the amount of sugar, fat, and salt.  The only way this could happen is if the government required it (as most European governments do to protect their people).<br /><br />Fat chance of that happening in the United States!<br /><br />Below are 29 reasons why food processors (and restaurants) will never lower or get rid of excessive amounts of sugar, fat and salt.<br /><br />Reason #1: Wall Street goes ballistic over health initiatives & anti-obesity campaigns<br /><br />- Wall Street drives the price of a company's stock down at news of a health or anti-obesity campaign, because they know customers will buy less of their product(s) if the fat, sugar, and salt are lowered.<br />- Kraft's anti-obesity initiative versus Morgan Stanley, Prudential securities, & 17% stock price plunge (p 257)<br />- When Campbell's soup announced that they'd be adding more salt to their soups, \\"Wall Street appreciated that Campbell was now going in what it saw as the right direction. The company's stock price closed up 1.3% that day\\". (pp 300-301).<br />- Frito-Lay assured Wall Street in private meetings that their market testing of low-fat chips to satisfy the growing outcry against the obesity epidemic was just a small part of their strategy to make snacks a larger part of the American diet (p 322).<br />- Frito Lay & PepsiCo hosted a 2 day meeting with analysts from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, etc., that included a private box at Yankee stadium to court Wall Street (p 322)<br />- \\"Food companies are deeply obligated toward their shareholders...Making money is the sole reason they exist--or so says Wall Street...Indeed, some experts believe that Wall Street was one of the chief causes of the obesity epidemic...\\" page 338.<br /><br />Why Food companies will NEVER get rid of sugar:<br /><br />1) Sugar both sweetens adds bulk and texture<br />2) Sugar makes the taste of food and drink irresistible<br />3) Sugar is cheap and is substituted for more expensive ingredients<br />4) It's essential to make food safe weeks or even months after they were made.<br />5) Sugar makes food look better: donuts full of sugar fry up bigger. Cookies, crackers, and breads without sugar are \\"shrunken, pale, flat, or distended\\".  Sugar gives candy bulk, texture, and crystallization<br />6) Bread with a lot of extra sugar takes longer to go stale<br />7) Cereal with lots of sugar is crunchier, fluffier and a pleasing shade of brown<br />8) Fructose: adds to longshelf life, doesn't form crystals so soft cookies don't harden, when baked mimics the finish you'd get if cooking at home, if frozen resists turning into ice, and it's much sweeter than table sugar. More research needs to be done, but a U.C. Davis study found fructose & corn syrup raised LDL cholesterol and triglycerides 25% (but not glucose).<br />9) Did you know that the starch in potato chips might as well be sugar - it's absorbed faster than sugar, and according to Eric Rimm, associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health \\"this causes the glucose levesl in the blood to spike, and this is a concern, in relation to obesity\\". P 329.<br /><br />Why Food companies will NEVER get rid of fat:<br /><br />1) Lowering fat can diminish taste or texture and lower sales (p 152)<br />2) Fat is very cheap ingredient (p152)<br />3) There can never be too much fat in a product, since fat is so pleasing that the brain doesn't send a \\"stop eating\\" signal. The more fat, the better (p158)<br />4) A combination of fat and sugar is the most irresistible, plus sugar makes the fat content undetectable, so people keep on eating. So to cram more cheap fat into a product, all that needs to be done is add some sugar and people won't even realize the food is high fat. So the only way fat can be reduced is to crank the sugar level up (pp158-159)<br />5) There's no funding for low-fat alternatives. A brand manager has a limited budget. So for example, to develop a low fat peanut butter might cost $5 million, plus $40 million to test it, and if it doesn't work, you'd lose your job (p 201)<br />6) Fat gives mouth feel to corn chips, crackers, ice cream, and cookies.<br />7) When a company lowers salt, sugar, or fat, they lose \\"stomach share\\" to companies that don't, i.e. Lunchables with less fat sold poorly, added carrot and apple slices wilted and turned brown because it takes weeks for food to be make it  to grocery store shelves (yecch!) so they wereremoved.<br /><br />Occasionally I see stories that it's okay to eat a lot of salt.  On page 304, Moss mentions that Frito Lay hired \\"experts\\" to badmouth studies linking salt to high blood pressure and write about the harms of too little salt, plus paid for research to cure the harmful effects of sodium.<br /><br />So I don't know if these stories are true, or if it's a tobacco / climate change denier \\"Merchants of Doubt\\" strategy, or if it's partly true -- okay if you're young and healthy.<br /><br />But there's an undeniable connection between too much salt and high blood pressure, which can lead to congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, kidney disease, and strokes.  The reason is that when you eat a lot of salt, the sodium pulls fluids from your tissues into your blood, and the increased volume of blood makes your heart pump harder, resulting in high blood pressure. Most of the salt people get is from processed food, not the salt shaker at home.<br /><br />Salt max/day: 1,500 mg salt if you have high blood pressure, 2,300 if you don't. Average consumed now: 3,500-4,000 mg<br /><br />Why Food companies will NEVER get rid of salt:<br /><br />1) Salt's greatly intensifies and enhances the taste and aroma of food<br />2) Salt's often cheaper than water.  The very definition of processed food is cheap ingredients (and no fiber).<br />3) Salt extends the shelf life of food<br />4) Salt makes sugar taste sweeter<br />5) Salt adds crunch to crackers and other products<br />6) Without salt, sugar, and/or fat, food tastes like straw or cardboard, and it's bitter, metallic, and astringent.<br />7) Salt hides bitter flavors<br />8) Moss writes: \\"Without salt, processed food companies cease to exist\\". (p 292)<br />9) Any product with meat must have salt to avoid what the industry calls Warmed over Flavor (WOF), when meat is reheated after precooking (i.e. soups, boxed meals, etc).  The taste has been described as damp dog hair, and people can smell and taste WOF at very low levels. WOF is also associated with a bad texture that is so objectionable people spit the food out.<br />10) WOF could be cured with healthy, nutritious, fresh spices, but herbs are more expensive than salt. Campbell's soup asked Moss to consider that adding herbs to replace salt would cost more, and who would pay for that? (p 300).<br />11) There's even more salt than you realize: dozens of sodium chemicals are added to delay spoilage, bind the ingredients, keep mixtures glued together, etc.  Here are some of the additional salts to look for on the label: monosodium glutamate, sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), sodium benzoate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate.<br />12) Salt is engineered for products. Cargill makes 1.7 Billion pounds of 40 kinds of salt per year: smashed, ground, pulverized, flaked, large granules, etc.  Their popcorn salt is designed to cling to popcorn.  A very fine powdered salt is used in processed meat and cheese.  Non-caking salt is used in dry soup, cereal and flour. Their \\"flavor burst\\" salt has a unique shape that dissolves 3 times as fast as regular salt and gives your brain an immediate jolt of salty flavor.<br /><br />Some companies keep their best selling products unchanged to give the customer (and Wall Street) what they want, and also make a \\"healthier\\" version, though if you know how to read labels you'll find that the \\"healthy\\" product isn't as much so as it would appear to be.<br /><br />Red meat: 18 ounces/week is okay. There is no safe level of consumption for processed meats - for every 1.7 ounces of processed meats eaten per day your risk of colorectal cancer goes up by 21%<br /><br />Addiction<br /><br />  Taste receptors light up for sugar not just on our mouth and tongue, but all the way from the esophagus to the stomach and pancreas.<br />  Sugar addiction: kids all over the world like food with sugar twice as sweet as adults do.<br />  Fat is equally addictive according to the latest brain studies (p 149).<br />  The food industry adds more and more sugar to kid's food.  Today's kids may expect, and want food to be sweeter than they otherwise would have when they grow up. Food scientist Danielle Reed says the food industry isn't just adding calories with all this sugar, \\"they're impacting the health of that child\\" when they manipulate and exploit children's higher cravings for sugar and salt.<br />  Companies spend millions trying to get the \\"bliss point\\" of their products just right - with just the right amount of sugar, not too much, not too little.<br /><br />White flour: a chemical-laden nutrition-free & fiber-free starch/sugar<br /><br />White flour is almost a sugar since it quickly converts to a sugar in your mouth. Your saliva has lots of amylase enzyme that immediately breaks it down into a sugar (p 14).<br /><br />Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to get food makers to voluntarily lower the salt in their food.  Breads and rolls had an average of 139 mg of sodium per ounce and Bloomberg asked for the level to be lowered to 103 mg. (p 297)<br /><br />What Moss doesn't know about is why food made with white flour that has no salt, sugar, or fat tastes bad.  My posts on Kessler's \\"The End of Overeating\\" and \\"Chemicals added to White Flour\\" at wholegrainalice explain why in more detail, but basically it's because white flour has had nearly all of the flavor and nutrition stolen after the bran & germ are removed.  That leaves nothing but a tasteless which no longer behaves like flour, so up to 30 chemicals are added, and these chemicals give flour a bad taste with metallic and bitter flavors.  Bakers have no choice but to add a lot of salt, sugar, and fat to hide these off flavors, a great deal more than people realize.<br /><br />Walter Willett, in Harvard's nutrition department accuses them of stripping away the nutritional value of food - most grains have been converted to starches. You may already know that starch is just a short step away from being sugar.<br /><br />It's ironic that Kellogg cereal is so full of sugar, because the founder John Harvey Kellogg was a health nut who ran a sanitarium where sugar was banned.  He fed his patients a roasted grain flaky concoction he'd invented that they liked well enough, but when his brother Will began adding sugar to the mix after he'd gone out of town, they came back for second and third helpings. John was furious, so Will left and started up a factory making his cereal, and it wasn't long before a former guest at the sanitarium, C. W. Post started a competing company.  It wasn't long until cereals were half sugar and even 70% sugar and by all rights ought to be in the candy aisle.<br /><br />Random disgusting facts<br /><br />  Yoplait yogurt has twice as much sugar per serving as Lucky Charms \\"cloyingly sweet, marshmallow-filled\\" cereal (p xiii)<br />  By 1960 over 1,500 chemical additives were being added to food<br />  More than any product, sugary drinks are responsible for the obesity crisis, which began with super-sizing of Coca-Cola and other sodas. By 1997 Americans drank 54 gallons of soda a year, double the amount of 1970.<br />  Two-thirds of the sugar in American's diet comes from processed food and therefore a lot of America's dental decay<br />  Processed and restaurant foods account for more than three-quarters of all sodium.<br />  Reducing sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods by 50 percent would save 150,000 lives a year<br />  It wasn't the FDA, FTC, or USDA that alerted the public to all the sugar in processed food - it was two dentists (p73-74).<br />  Philip Morris, masters of getting people addicted to tobacco, own Kraft & General Foods, where they use that expertise to addict people to processed food<br />  Processed Cheese: There's no cheese in Cheez Whiz or Velveeta (p162, 166)<br />  Winner of one of the most disgusting recipes I've ever heard of: Paula Deen's bacon-wrapped balls of macaroni and cheese deep-fried in oil (p 178)<br />  Lunchables were invented because Oscar Meyer was desperate to sell bologna and other processed meats, which people were consuming less as they became aware of the health hazards<br />  \\"Pink Slime\\": ammonia-processed beef from the parts of cows most exposed to feces with E. coli that used to go towards pet food or tallow but became a favorite of fast-food hamburger chains and the school lunch program (226-7).<br />  Nestlé's snack \\"Hot Pocket\\" has over 100 ingredients including salt, sugar, and fat several times over (with alternative names). Each had the daily limit of saturated fat and salt, and 6 teaspoons of sugar - more than the average woman should eat and 2/3 of a man's daily intake.  These have a shelf life of 420 days.<br /><br />Manipulation<br /><br />  Cereal makers spend twice as much on advertising as they do on the ingredients in the cereal<br />  Young kids are so gullible that they can't understand commercials aren't true, or understand how much they're being influenced. The average 1979 child saw 20,000 commercials between 2 and 11, half for sweetened foods (p 80).<br />  The ads targeted at children were: 3,832 sugary cereals, 1,627 candy & gum, 841 cookies & crackers, 582 fruit drinks, 184 cakes, pies, & desserts.  4: unsweetened food (i.e. meat, fish, or vegetable juice).<br />  Babies do NOT like salt until they're 6 months old, but salt is put into baby food to get them to crave salt as soon as possible, because once they're taught to like salt it has a deep and lasting effect on what they eat the rest of their life (pp 279-281).<br />  Coke's strategy: Emotional. Sell cola where special moments happen - ball parks, beaches, always within arm's reach, ubiquitous.<br />  Put images of fruit and the word fruit on packages even if there's little or no fruit at all in the product (i.e. Kool-Aid, Tang, Capri Sun).<br />  \\"Fruit Drinks\\" have juice concentrate, which is \\"entirely devoid of fiber, flavors, aromas or any other attribute of real fruit\\". It's just another kind of sugar, equally lacking in nutrition.<br />  The last thing industrial food makers want is for you to feel full, then you'll stop eating.  They've discovered that big distinct flavors are easily detected by the brain and signals are sent back that you're full quickly.  So food makers are careful to add flavors that tantalize you but not enough to make you satiated.<br />  Pages 62 through 67 describe how home economics classes in schools went from teaching how to make healthy food from scratch to using commercial products so that when girls grew up, they'd continue to eat processed food.<br />  Food researchers now use fMRI brain wave studies to find out what you really like because brain waves are more reliable than what people say.<br />  Food companies add and tout the one good ingredient they've put in and hope you'll overlook all the bad stuff that's there as well.<br />  Kellogg claimed that eating frosted mini-wheat cereal improved children's attentiveness by nearly 20%.  Not true (pp 90-93)<br /><br />Tip<br /><br />Cheese should be served in very small portions as a special treat like it used to be, not as an ingredient in food.  The same for chocolate truffles or any food high in fat and calories: eat them in small amounts directly so they can be savored.<br /><br />Miscellaneous<br /><br />Some researchers think we don't eat for pleasure so much as to avoid the more painful feeling of true hunger pain, even though we can easily go without food for a day with no problem.  So at the first sign of hunger, we eat. Our bodies make us feel lousy if we don't, and our fear of hunger is so deeply rooted.<br /><br />Sugar max/day: 5 tsp. women, 9 tsp men. Average consumed now: 22 tsp/day<br /><br />100 names for sugar (from thefoodlabelmovement.org)<br /><br />Agave nectar, Barbados sugar, Birch sugar, Barley malt, Barley malt syrup, Beet sugar, Brown rice syrup, Brown sugar, Coconut sugar, Cane juice, Cane sugar, Carbitol, Caramel coloring, Concentrated fruit juice, Corn sweetener, Corn syrup, Date sugar, Dextrin, Dextrose, Disaccharides, Evaporated cane juice, Fructooligosaccharides (FOS), Fructose, Fruit juice concentrate, Galactose, Glucitol, Glucosamine, Gluconolactone, Glucose, Glucose polymers, Glucose syrup, Glycerine, Glycerol, Glycol, Hexitol, High-fructose corn syrup, Honey, Inverse syrup, Inversol, Invert sugar, Isomalt, Karo syrup, Lactose, Levulose, \\"Light\\" sugar, \\"Lite\\" sugar, Malitol, Malt dextrin, Malted barley, Maltodextrin, Maltodextrose, Maltose, Malt, Mannitol, Mannose, Maple syrup, Molasses, Monosaccarides, Neotame, Pentose, Polydextrose, Powdered sugar, Raisin juice, Raisin syrup, Raw sugar, Ribose rice syrup, Rice malt, Rice sugar, Rice sweetener, Rice syrup solids, Saccharides, Sorbitol, Sorghum, Sucanat, Sucrose, Sugar cane, Tagatose, Trisaccharides, Turbinado sugar, Unrefined sugar, White sugar, Xylitol, Xylose<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Moss interviewed hundreds of people for his book, and they nearly all said that the food industry will not give up salt, sugar, and fat without a major fight because they're the very foundation of processed food.  He heard this from chemists, nutritionists, marketing executives, CEOs, lobbyists and many other professionals (p 337).<br /><br />Nearly all of them avoid eating their own products (p 341).<br /><br />You'd have to be in solitary confinement for the past 40 years to not know that restaurant and processed food are bad for you.  I have no sympathy for adults, but I'm quite angry that children are the target and life-long victims of this crap.<br /><br />Nutrition should be required starting in Kindergarten, schools should have gardens, and students taught how to make meals from scratch.  To fund these programs, the FDA & USDA should be disbanded - they're useless, toothless, and governed by revolving door insiders.<br /><br />All that time you're saving buying this crap isn't exactly saving time if you die early, or are miserable from poor health.  Moss says people buy this junk because they're short on time and it's cheap, but you can cook quick, less inexpensive, healthy food at home for a lot less money and live a longer, healthier life.  An internet search of \\"fast and cheap healthy recipes\\" brings up hundreds of recipes.<br /><br />Even if you read labels it's hard to figure out how much fat, salt, and sugar is in a product, because the serving size is ridiculously low, or the sugar is in the ingredients list has 5 different kinds of sugar to try to hide how much there is.  White flour is not required to list the dozens of added chemicals, so you'll never know what chemicals were used in a product that contains white flour.<br /><br />Many companies outright lie about their products, hoping the Center for Science in the Public Interest won't notice.  Food processors aren't afraid of the USDA or FDA, who seem to have forgotten that the American public is their \\"customer\\", not the food industry.  By the time the FDA tells a company to knock it off, the company is on to a new advertising campaign anyway (p 92).<br /><br />In the future, as increasing population collides with resource and energy decline, as topsoil loses its fertility from being blown and washed away, and the last schools of fish harvested, people will be envious and amazed there was ever a time when the problem was so much food that billions of people became imprisoned within their own walls of fat.

0525478817|5.0|I've had The Fault in Our Stars sitting on my shelf since its release day. Not because I didn't want to read it, with all of the buzz it was actually high on my to-read pile. Unfortunately, I just never got around to it until this week, and oh how I regret waiting so long to read this book.<br /><br />What can I say about The Fault in Our Stars that hasn't already been said? This book took me on an emotional roller-coaster that I'm not entirely sure I'll ever recover from.<br /><br />I started this book on Tuesday around 11PM, having just finished The Spectacular Now, and had real life not gotten in the way, I'm sure I would've finished TFiOS in one sitting. This book pulled me in, and all I wanted to do was to keep reading about Augustus and Hazel.<br /><br />What I loved most about The Fault in Our Stars was how Green constructed both Hazel and Augustus. Here you have these two kids, suffering from a terrible, terrible disease, and yet, they don't allow their disease to become them. They still know how to smile, to laugh, to live - and honestly, they bring out the best in one another. It isn't a cancer story, it's a story about two teenagers that just so happen to have cancer. In fact, it actually kind of reminded me of 50/50 in that it managed to balance the humor with the pain, and it did so wonderfully.<br /><br />I didn't understand why so many others had stated they bawled their eyes out while reading this until I came upon the scene at the gas station. That is the first time that we really get to see the vulnerable side of Augustus Waters, and it is absolutely heartbreaking. That scene - as well as the whole book, honestly - just felt so real. And the pain only grows from there on out.<br /><br />As for the ending... I honestly was expecting it to end mid-sentence, like I was fearing something would happen to Hazel, that her story would play out like Anna's, and that in the middle of reading, everything would just end, but not really end. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. The ending was actually beautifully written, and though I still have many questions, I'm satisfied with how Green ended their story.<br /><br />I'm not big into re-reading books, but this is one I can easily see myself re-reading time and time again.sn't the case.

B00422LESO|4.0|Laugh-out-loud, delightful summer escapism, Austenland is Fantasy Camp for fans like me who can't get enough of Austen's books. Or, more importantly in this case, Colin Firth's definitive Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Jane Hayes is thirty-something; smart, pretty, professional, lovable, loyal...and a complete loser in the love department. Why? Because no man can possibly live up to her perfect romantic fantasy: the elusive, erudite, aloof but passionate Fitzwilliam Darcy. Determined to &#34;cure&#34; Jane of the fixation that is blocking her from finding happiness, her Great Aunt Carolyn bequeaths her the Vacation of a Lifetime: three weeks at Pembrook Park, an immersive Regency Period resort where guests live out their own Austen story, complete with corsets, empire dresses, and gorgeous actors employed to portray Darcy-esque romantic suitors. Jane knows on a basic level that the whole enterprise is a metaphor for how pathetic her real life is, but she is gamely determined to enjoy living her fantasy and hopefully purging it from her system. What she doesn't anticipate is how easily the lines between what is &#34;real,&#34; and what is just play-acting, become blurred.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a vignette detailing a hilarious past romantic disaster before moving back into Jane's present predicament. The HEA ending is telegraphed fairly obviously by 3/4 of the way through the story, but it is nonetheless satisfying.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Really sad Vince past away - be great if someone picks up the mantle and continue the stories. I've read them all - enjoyed them all and these were the first eBooks I purchased. Discovered the $.99 books, but never hesitated to splurged for this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the &#34;first class&#34; series to come along in the all too miserable lineup of dreadful and worthless shows we are forced to watch.  What a pleasant experience to see something well written, well directed and produced and beautifully acted.  Maggie Smith is superb and who wouldn't want Carson as their butler.  Thank you for another extraordinarily entertaining season.  Keep them coming.  Also would like to say that the period costumes are absolute perfection as well as the set decor.

B009AY04A8|4.0|A little longer than competetive hidden object games, it holds ones interest and is good for all ages over about 10. Story line gives it a 4 out of 5 for me, but definitely worth the money.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|This is the sexiest music known to all human kind! Listen to it at your peril: it will create orgasms.
B00DU73T08|3.0|I had to watch this since I read the book. It was a difficult book to translate so I do not think most people would like it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very fun to play. Can't wait to play everyday. Beats going out to play. Play at your own time. Only thing is your credits are not much. Would be nice to get more.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|A wonderful app. I have had no trouble with any of its applications. Runs smooth with many features to view my document.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a welcome addition for my tablet. Easy to set up. Now I can easily have an alarm clock where ever I am.
B004HWT6DO|5.0|You can see why this got academy award for best script the year it came out. The acting of the main character is quite amazing too. So subtle. Great flick!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I really didn't want to put it down. It was amazing what people of color and women went through.  My heart broke and soared all within the pages of this book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Oh course Harry Potter is great and I'm so glad I found this collection because buying each DVD separately would've cost an arm and a leg. I love the series and think anyone of any age would love it too!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|downloaded on a whim and have enjoyed it ever since. surprisingly fun and addictive with great in game graphics and fun interactive mini games.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1QC8MQ9KRVHTS]]I bought this just to increase the quality of my GoPro video for motorsport.  Here is my first try.  You'll notice some clipping but overall MUCH better than the built in go-pro mic.<br /><br />I taped the microphone to the rear license plate for this video.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The character development is really something. Any weak points in this movie are far outweighed by its strengths. Most people have never heard of it, so I recommend it often. It's well worth the time and money. The ending is just too good for words. The subtitles did not detract at all for me. Don't miss it.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I found this book provided a great head start to my learning process. There's a ton of theory sprinkled with practical experience.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Things are heating up and finally they may be truthful with each other!!  Its about time, too many almosts leading up to this one!
1423141997|5.0|Bought this series for my grand-daughter, and she has not been able to get her face out of these books, she liked them so much that she is reading them all over again, just in case she missed something.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Its about darn time these two got together!  This season was great, the ending not what I expected and I am certainly curious about how the next season will start!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like this app. There are nice options for the alarm sounds, and the ability to set multiple alarms is extremely convenient.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|This rechargeable battery is a must have extra battery to take along with you, when taking lots of pictures like I do. I own a Nikon J1 and whenever I am getting ready to leave with my camera I make sure the battery is fully charged and put it right in my camera bag.  Some days I might take just a few pictures and other days more then a hundred.<br /><br />The battery holds the charge very well when I am taking pictures.  The time to charge the battery, which plugs directly into the wall, is approximately two hours.<br /><br />If you enjoy taking pictures then this is a must for you.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is a nice place to visit but you might not want to live there. The place and a lot of its residents are &#34;troubled&#34;. Some find it a haven and some just want the troubles to end by whatever means possible. FBI Agent Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) has a way with the troubled and finds a place in Haven that only she can fill. Sherriff Nathan Warnos and the towns bad boy Duke round out a perfect cast in this weird, scary and often funny town. Adapted from a Steven King story you know it will be filled with twists and turns and just enough gore to make it interesting. Enjoy the ride.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids LOVE this game. It's colorful and fun and you can see when you surpass your friends. I've even found myself playing this game while waiting for the kids to get out of school or at an appointment.
B002APU580|5.0|This is a favorite movie for our family.  We love the story, and the acting and scenery make me feel transported to a different time. I would recommend it to any one who enjoys the past.
145210655X|5.0|This book is hilarious! My husband bought it for my son for his birthday and he reads it every night before he goes to bed. Recently he's started to repeat lines from it. It's great for any age!
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Hey it's batman, who doesn't like batman.  I enjoyed the movie it was entertaining and did keep me guessing as to what was going to happen next.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Order came quite a few days earlier than expected, which was a good thing!  We were anxious to watch the full series!  It came in perfect condition!  This series should be on everyone's to get list!  Hilarious!  Hours of fun!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is really fun, especially with the great graphics. Good story and<br />challenging. Well worth the $2.99 I paid for the fun.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This is a complex story with few clues thrown in in advance, but much typecasting.  The author has a good handle on descriptions.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is a mix of hidden object,  logic, and mystery solving. If your a fan of  Nancy Drew or Sherlock  you will love this game. BY
B007URVZJ6|2.0|Lots of information, but I could not find how to print it out for reference, nor more precise information about many of the instructions.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I haven't finished this yet, but so far it is a good read. I have it on my Nook e reader.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is a refreshing change from most shows on television.  Good actors and I also love the time period.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|It is ok. Right off the bat you don't have everything you need to play. You have to buy the items right from the start. Would be a fun game for little kids to play.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Just like the real movie of iron man 3. I loved the new runs you get when you update the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a great, fun, east read for teens to 40 something's, maybe beyond. Great book to read on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME sooo good I love it so much fun like Black ops or Modern warfare or if you prefer Battlefield I love all of the this game is awesome
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The plot was so predictable and none of the woman that likeable.  I just got bored with the whole thing.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|Brings back sweet gorey memorys, movie looks great in HD, couple special features here and there, my brother even liked this too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was totally hooked by episode 3. I love the way they talked. It was a little fast at first and hard to understand, but you get used to it quickly. So much drama and love. I can't wait for the next season. I still haven't decided if I can wait it out and watch it all at once or if I should just watch it weekly. That's sucks though.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I uh, cannot seem to open the game after the last update. Gameloft, you might want to fix that... Just saying...
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Rick Riordan created an absolute masterpiece told from the points of view of Carter and Sadie Kane. I've read many great books before but this one is the greatest.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love it just wish I could grasp how to get my games over to my kindle h d ...any help would be great
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the writing style of Hosseini. He writes quiet, and tells a great story.<br />Maybe not as good as &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, but it comes close.<br />Highly recommend. This is a great book & should be appreciated for a very long time.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Another good read from Ian Rankin ,<br />still have about 1/4 of it to read to finish book .<br /><br />Love my Kindle & am slowly getting used it .<br /><br />Missing the feel of a proper book .
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this second book of the Century Trilogy.  A great way to recap our world history with a little fiction in there to move it along.  I look forward to the third book.
B005LAII9O|1.0|Screen menu doesn't allow you to to the disk menu without watching advertising. Advertising is real advertising, not movie previews (advertising for cable service, plus previews, plus lots of loading screens, anti-piracy screens etc etc).<br /><br />Minimum points.<br /><br />This is the year 2013 and I could watch this advertising free on Amazon Prime video or Netflix. Putting this on the disk you buy and wait for in the mail to have a better experience is not acceptable.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|I love the Harry Potter books and movies and now my son is getting into watching the movies as well
B004TI5N38|5.0|Liked main character; good plot which comes together as new pieces of puzzle are given. Next book--Forgotten-- is even better.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Witty, sensitive, and one I couldn't put down.  I laughed out loud and cried so hard I couldn't read.  Fantastic!
B000FBJAEG|2.0|I've always enjoyed David Baldacci's work, but this time...not so much.  Endless exposition by too many characters.  Inane plot twists.  80% dialogue and 20% action.  Finished it, but only to find out who done it.
B00AU15HPC|1.0|The Moody Blues crescendoed with Seventh Sojourn. Hayward and Lodge produced a slightly less treasure with Blue Jays. Hayward has created a few minor pleasantries with some of his subsequent solo work, with View From the Hill being the best Moody Blues album to come out since SS, though a distant second on account of its major overproduction and a few schmaltzy inclusions.<br /><br />All the official Moody Blues albums to come out since SS have proven major disappointments, as the band lost both Pinder and the purity of their youthful visions and settled into wealth-induced middle age banality, with the remaining members appearing onstage time and again through the decades as plasticized versions of their former glory, aided by a largely anonymous backup band, always looking back, playing songs note for note, never stretching out and jamming, while lacking the psychedelic wakefulness and heart that made their first seven albums so special.<br /><br />But this latest output of Hayward's is pure crap, the worst of his worst, and only blindly adulating fans attest otherwise. Hayward said that he had penned a number of songs with social commentary but that he ditched those in favor of those he said were more personal. But in VFTH, as with the first seven MB albums, the best tracks involved social commentary and came off intensely personal at the same time.<br /><br />So Hayward might learn something from his latest misadventure and go back to the studio with the ditched numbers. Perhaps he might come out with something slightly resembling the output of his former years. Putting down the pot pipe and taking a couple acid trips out in nature before doing so might help him recall what it's all about.
B008602KQI|5.0|Writing, acting, camera work was all amazing, in my opinion.  One of my favorite movies of all time and I feel like there's more to it than I understand.  I have watched it many times and highly recommend it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Such a great album & such good value. You have to watch Searching for Sugarman if you haven't already too. It's a great doco with most of these songs in it.... BUT the album is a must. Can't stop playing it.
B005DJREJS|2.0|just not entertaining, sorry<br /> i don't have six teen more words for my review. okay now i only need six more
1878424319|5.0|This book came right on the due date and it was cheap. I would recommend this to anyone getting school boos.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|Very accurate step counter but the phone app and web app leave a lot to be desired. Very rudimentary graphs that don't provide a lot of feedback except you've sleep too long or not enough. Many iPhone apps such as sleep bot and sleep cycle blow away pulse in the amount of analyzation they provide and they're free. Withings scale and blood pressure machines which I own provide fairly staright forward information but again the graphs are fairly one dimensional and provide little direction. In a highly competitive field Withings needs to step up its game.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This game help my daughter learn how to work through challenges by using fun puzzles and the controls are so easy to use that at four years she is able to navigate on her own.
1781162646|5.0|I is very important  to h0ld my interest from chapter to chapter,and thesr books do better than that from page to page esp king--he is unique
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Ouite enjoyable even for seniors like me!<br />I have spent more time playing this game than I care to admit.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the story and how the relationship between two completely different people became strong and bounding. I recommend all three books for couples to reevaluate their personal life.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This version makes the Stallone version look like Scooby Doo in comparison. Leroy Urban does a stone cold Dredd and boy was it enjoyable. Make no mistake, it is gory and too overdone in that regard but overall this one is a winner. No compromise , no surrender and take no S&*T. His rookie sidekick comes into her own very quickly and the interaction is well acted. In fact, the performances are spot on all in general. This is NOT a movie for the kids but for some action, shoot em up, and incidental comedy you could do much worse. I would give it 5 stars if there was less gore.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book finally made me understand why my husband is always want to be in control and why he has the need to know everything I do ....
B0098VXDDS|5.0|SPARTACUS SERIES JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ANYONE WHO LOVES ACTION SCENES WITH LOTS OF BLOOD!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great puzzle game where you try to drop candy in the mouth of a cute little monster. To do this, you need to cut ropes strategically so that the candy not only falls into his mouth, but captures stars along the way.<br /><br />This is  great puzzle game! DEFINITELY worth the price of the app!
B00280LYIM|5.0|My son loves this series and it has encouraged him to do even more reading. Couldn't be more thrilled with that!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have yet to find another series that equals Suzanne Collins' trilogy -- these books rival George Orwell's books not only in the writing but in the superb message, especially considering the society that now exists in this great country. I hope that the young readers who devour these books will realize their self-worth and how much they can change this country back into a great republic by identifying with the superb characters that Collins created. Bravo, Suzanne! Keep them coming, as you have a fan for life!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Makes you use your brain, gets harder, yet simple. So much fun to play if you want something not too complicated.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. I started watching it on Netflix thinking I wouldn't like it and was so hooked I bought all the seasons.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|A new twist on an old tale, kind of amusing and a bit cliche' at times but worth watching once
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Fantastic!  Can hardly wait until November when Catching Fire comes out!!!!  I enjoyed this almost as much as the Twilight saga.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|Metallica will never go out of style. Sounds as good today as it did back then. The music exports easily to iTunes and the download is fast..
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have been playing Dragonvale for four months and it is still fun, challenging and interesting. The graphics are great and the developers put in a real effort to keep things new and exciting.<br /><br />I have hit a few glitches such as short periods when I get kicked off all the time or the loading hangs at the menu.  Updating the app and rebooting my device have been sufficient to fix those issues.<br /><br />Twice I have actually lost my whole park BUT, by logging out of Facebook, force stopping Dragonvale and then restarting Dragonvale and logging back into Facebook brought it back both times.<br /><br />The game is challenging without being frustrating and it is mellow without being boring.  Occasionally, a rare dragon will take 20 or 30 tries but I've been able to get all of them so far (except Double Rainbow - that one's extra-tricky).<br /><br />My 9-year-old son plays and enjoys it as well.<br /><br />We look forward to checking in on our parks each day .  :)
B0092MJICS|5.0|Timeless tunes and a beautiful voice, how can you go wrong? The music exports easily to iTunes and the download is fast..
B0015AARJI|4.0|The product works as advertised. It is too early to tell how good it is, because that will depend on how long the rechargeable battery lasts and how well it avoids developing &#34;memory&#34; that limits capacity. Now, I'm continuing to run it until it totally drains before recharging in order to condition it. Time will tell how well that works.
B00AH69AX0|5.0|Metallica will never go out of style. Sounds as good today as it did back then. The music exports easily to iTunes and the download is fast..
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Transformers II and this movie have the same base. That base almost put me to sleep. For kids its ok but Im adult.
B0092MJ6B6|5.0|Timeless tunes and a beautiful voice, how can you go wrong? The music exports easily to iTunes and the download is fast..
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is well-written, amusing, amazingly acted, and makes you think. I had heard great things, but was stupefied by how truly incredible it is.  I even have my pre-teen and teenager involved in watching it.  Can't ask for a better review than a 12 year voting to watch Sherlock on a Friday night instead of mindlessly playing X-box!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Beware, these books will get you hooked. This book kept me reading hours. I read the entire trilogy and each book gets better.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Tom Cruise has had his issues recently, but he is almost always a reliable actor.  He came prepared for his normal action/drama role.  The standout though was the premise, special effects,  and his co-star, Andrea Riseborough.  Her refusal to accept the situation they were in was fabulous. Morgan Freeman phoned it in though, but even then that's better than half the actors out there.
B001UG56ES|5.0|is one of the best  movies ever made and would watch it again and again. I will buy it at some time.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|I was expecting better... and I love these heroes... but this was just ho hum. Even a little predictable - actually, a LOT predictable!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|It seemed like forever before this DVD was released.  I hooked my son on Walking Dead and he waiting patiently for this..
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|But they tried here to capture the escence of the book. It's good, not great. The book is great and I read it over & over.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is such a fun game. You really have to concentrate. So much fun trying to beat your time every time you play.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I love this movie and watch it whenever I want that 'feel good' moment. Spader and Russell really nail it on this one and the story is so unique they created a series (2?) from it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It is kind of twisty in it's plot and while watching you question if this is based on someone's personal experience with Chicago politics. Often Liberals are protagonists as they imply evil, and ignorant motives from the other side of the aisle, but they are not portrayed as angels and it seems to be a criticism of bureaucratic corruption in general.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read this book as a library loan on my kindle.  My husband was very angry at the author when he read it.  She was dishonest in his opinion; holding information back and a few other similar writing \\"strategies.\\"  I kept reading this book, despite his complaints but had trouble with the story itself.  These people are either stupid or not nice.  The ending was very depressing to me.  I ended up being very angry at the time I wasted slogging through the diary portion of the book.  I felt that I had wasted my time because of the lack of payoff at the end.  I really don't have much of a reason to recommend it.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Good:<br /><br />*  Pretty lightweight, fits well on my head and feels like there is space between my ears and the speakers.  This gives me the feeling that my desktop speakers are on and that I am not wearing headphones (this is a good thing!!!).<br />*  I LOVE the roller volume control on the side.  This is a great feature.  I wasn't sure how much taht I would like this but it is a great idea and works really well.<br />*  Battery life seems pretty good, I haven't had any gaming sessions cut short (7ish hours) and so I am happy.  I understand that you can run the headset while plugged in so if you forget to charge the thing, it'll still work (great feature!).<br />*  7.1 that you can feel.  I think that this headset could have more low toned bass but it works well in general.<br />*  The range on this headset is really far and will easily go 40'.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />* Sound quality is sometimes good and sometimes bad.  I will hear poping come from the headset.<br />* I would have liked to have had a stand for the headset.  The one that comes with the Razer Chimera is great as it has a place to hang the headset as well as charge it without having to plug it in (too bad the Chimera is a terrible headset otherwise).<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I have been looking for a long time to find a higher end wireless headset for gaming that wasn't made for consoles.  This headset has a great mic, good sound, and is designed to work with PCs.  I recommend this headset, I got it on sale here on Amazon for $99 with Prime, I got it next day for free!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|A little hard to get into for some reason, but suddenly it picked up and I couldn't put it down. Really enjoying this series, after talking about starting it for 2 years.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Although I bought this book hoping Dr. Alexander would sway my feelings about an afterlife, he failed to do it. I didn't finish the book as he lost me when he started explaining the chemistry of it all.
B004EYT932|2.0|In light of the subsequent developments concerning the methodology used by the authors, reading this book left me somewhat ambivalent.  On the one hand, the sloppy data has been used to justify a policy of needless austerity that has caused material hardship on millions of people.  On the other hand, the same sloppy data has been used to justify the abysmal performance of the Western economies over the past several years and give regulators and government officials a free pass from criticism.  Perhaps the authors might consider surrendering their tenured positions as penance and taking jobs in the nearest fast food restaurant - a fate that their &#34;empirical findings&#34; have imposed on the vast majority of job-seekers during the last five years.  I love America - you can be spectacularly wrong, but there are just not consequences if you are in government or a professor.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Purchased as a birthday present for my 6 year old granddaughter and she loved it.  She completed it is just a few hours.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it ! Love ,Love the characters and Love that British accent.  I am looking forward to the next season
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein is a band with it's own unique sound, and their debut album Herzeleid showcases that beautifully! Rammstein is a unique mix of metal riffs, great bass, pounding drums,and synthesizers, and when you add Till Lindemann's deep, strong voice singing in German, it is pure perfection!<br /><br />The songs on Herzeleid are: Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen, Der Meister, Wei&szlig;es Fleisch , Asche zu Asche, Seemann, Du riechst so gut, Das alte Leid, Heirate Mich, Herzeleid, Laichzeit  and Rammstein.<br /><br />I was blown away by this album, Herzeleid is an 18 year old album and it sounds like nothing I have ever heard. You will become a Rammstein fan immediately after listening to this album, I know I have!!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I loved this game and was it was a guilty pleasure for many months. It takes a bit of time to get your park going but is very fun once you get going.<br /><br />I finally reached level 20 and started downloading the glacier part of the park. Halfway through downloading, the download stopped and crashed the game. It brought me back to the main park. Guess what? I only have the Triceratops now and one tiny parcel of land. I had several dinosaurs (just purchased Allosaurus) and many parcels of land. Strange. The game still shows me at level 20.<br /><br />No reason to play now that I am back at square one... extremely disappointed and to be honest I am really just sad about losing all my dinosaurs.
B002V092M4|1.0|Usually when I trash a book that is well regarded I start with I am sorry but....<br /><br />In this case I am not sorry. There are more great books out there than I will ever find time for. To be one third of a way through the book without any real idea on what I think to the chracters or even if there is a plot lurking somewhere I think it is taking liberties.<br /><br />I got to the bit where it was mildy interesting on trying to infiltrate Russian spies and then a characters Daughter fell off a horse. That was the end for me.<br /><br />The phrase art for arts sake sprang to mind. Just tell the story!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|After many splitters, and many splitters burning out if too much juice is needed, or just not providing enough power, this one worked perfect. I run a car service business where the drivers use full tablets (android) with a program always running, screen always on, and GPS navigation running though it non stop. Tablets would run out of juice or burn out lesser splitters, but this one is perfect, and have had no problems yet. I have already purchased 20 for the cars, and am making another purchase right now. 5/5 Starts, Zero problems.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|I like Grisham. I feel that he pretty much has only 3 stories and re-badges one of them every year but I enjoy all the same. This one is a good read, great plot development and likeable characters. The twist unfortunately is sign-posted too early and you see it coming but it does not spoil the enjoyment.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Rented and watched this just now. Awesome movie. Recommend it, is it me or does Matthew mcconaughey get better with each movie.
B00190N4E4|5.0|What a great movie!  What a magnificent performance!  Having just waded through the autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi, I realized how much of the movie was taken from his book -- it's an incredibly deft and sensitive adaptation.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I have become addicted to the series and can't help<br />but look forward to the following episode.  We've watched seasons<br />2 and 3 in the past week, and are anxious to begin watching season 4<br />in January.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I wanted to be able to take pictures of birds at my birdfeeder and hopefully them not notice me so that is why I purchased the remote cord. It is very easy to use.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great and super easy to use. I use it for everything I need to calculate definitely download this app
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I had taken pictures of my grandbabies with out a speedlight and they were too dark without a flash and with the flash there was a shadow.  With the bounce effect I can take pictures without the shadows.
B002ZFQD0E|1.0|I've seen Janelle Monae a couple of times on television and liked what she performed. I did not like this CD at all.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Season 5 is just as much a must-have as previous seasons for fans of the show. Sure to make you laugh, it is not hard to see why this show remains at the top of the viewer's charts.
B007RP4D5Y|3.0|To me, this was not quite as good as some of the Pat Metheny Group CD's. I miss not hearing Lyle Mays on piano threaded throughout this CD.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Any fan of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; should add this to their collection. The fish tank is actually larger than it appears online, and the 5-disc set stores neatly in the back. It even lights up to provide that sufficient eerie feeling captured in the show when it made its first appearance. This item is great and it seems like they out-do themselves with each passing season that is released.
B007XNAQLA|4.0|I've been a fan of this band for years but I thought the return would be with new music. I liked this CD
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is one of the greatest epics ever written.  A great coming of age story set in a fantastic world.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved being transported to another point in history.  Disappointed that the book eventually ended- hope she writes another one soon!
630471193X|5.0|A serious movie, but with some great light moments.  Too bad we use so very little of our brain capacity!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game. hours of fun and the whole family enjoys playing. this is a must get.  like seek games download this game and have fun!!!!!!
6302797519|5.0|This is a well-done story and highlights Peter O'Toole's leading-man qualities as an actor! This should be required viewing for drama students.
1607066017|5.0|....Cowboy BeBop, which is a great thing. Now im not saying that this is anyhting like Cowboy but it just reminds me of it. It's everything i could have hoped for in a comic. Buy it for the 5$ because believe me it;s worth it
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Yea, it's somewhat predictable and familiar but it's fairly well done.  We found the movie to be quite enjoyable on an evening when light entertainment was desired.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its the best game I've ever played on this app store. everyone should download it. really its fun trust me.awesome
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Gripping.  I was hooked from the first page.  This book is very hard and fascinating to read -- I loved the way the story was split into different lives of the character, Jun Do
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I love a good World War Two story, and this one is the best I've read as of lately. Delivered in a style that combines the commercial appeal of a stay-up-half-the-night page-turner with the beautiful literary writing style that makes the author's Oxford education obvious, this story places the readers in the middle of war-torn Europe.<br /><br />The fast-paced plot, vivid descriptions of settings, characters, and events are so vivid and so realistic, they took me back to my grandparents' true stories of running a military battlefield hospital in Europe during the war. The reality of shot-down badly burnt pilots, war-time romance, the ultimate tests of friendship and loyalty that only war can bring - all these and more unique and highly emotionally charged experiences were brought to life for me as I read this book.<br /><br />A fascinating and moving story told very well. Highly recommended.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Those guys never let me down!! Every release is priceless.  I have been a fan since City of Evil Thank you
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|Can't dl for kindle fire. boo.<br /><br />Fire HD, an download it. but it duplicates emails in the kindle, that aren't duplicated in the web browser on a computer. and when you delete one of the duplicates on fire hd, it deletes it from gmail. hard to predict which is duplicate and why it's doing that.<br />sync'ing issues is a huge problem.
030789701X|4.0|It es a fantastic book.  But it is just like the paperback except it does include information on the 2 add-ons.<br />The MAIN reason I did not rate it  5+  it the tiny print-just like the paperback.  I expected at least larger print in a LEGENDARY COLLECTOR'S EDITION.
0307271080|3.0|There was a lot I liked about this book and that I found interesting and challenging. I recognized myself in stupid things liberal white people say to Africans or about race and I actually thought this was fair in observational terms (although not necessarily in relational terms - i.e. where she considered people's motives at all, they were either bad or ill-informed). I found the Nigeria sections of the book more engaging, just because this was new territory for me, although I recognized a lot about her America sections (especially as I went to school at Penn in West Philly). The reason I can't give this huge effort more stars is that on an emotional level, I found the book missed the mark pretty consistently. Although the young love between Ifemelu and Obinze was nicely conveyed, once she is in the US, the contrivance [spoiler alert]] of her being unable to get a job --> humiliating sexual encounter --> shame so bad she cuts off the love of her life completely for 15 years (leaving her time to have two nearly fairy tale relationships with wealthy, highly accomplished American men) were plot drive, not character driven developments.  Ifemelu, for all her intelligence and observational skill, seems unable to dredge up any real sympathy/empathy for her parents, her struggling aunt, or even Obinze whom she cut off at the knees, much less some of the incidental characters that only get their pain dissected for study, but not understanding. Even when her beloved cousin has an emotional setback, she completely skirts what might be an interesting exploration because the therapist in the story tells her not to press the young man.  I was thinking about how often journal entries or letters are used as a device in books and how they often are used to add emotional resonance.  The blogs in this case - which were written in a kind of breezy, half-humorous, half-angry tone - actually detracted from the emotional resonance of the book...for me at any rate.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love the fact the hidden items are not stationary in the game, meaning every time you play a scene the hidden items are in different places. My only complaint would be that I would like to be able to buy more items using coins than using the gems. That being said this game has kept me coming back daily, sometimes more often, for the last two months and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I watched Downton on my Kindle Fire and I really don't know how I'm going to get through the next season waiting for each episode week to week!  The series is excellent, the characters are rich and I now consider myself a Downton addict.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Super show you never know where the twists will take you the writers are super with there believable imaginations great if you like sic fi and crime
B00679T1EO|5.0|While I have the Downton Abbey series 1-3 on dvd, the biggest thing I notice is that colors just pop with Blu-ray! Red, blue, and violet colors are fantastic. Just for the better colors I would recommend the series on Blu-ray.<br />Now for the caveat: It needs to be stated somewhere that if buying Blu-ray discs of Downton, the Christmas Special is NOT included, and one must buy the Christmas Special as separate disc, otherwise you end up season 2 with Matthew not even wanting to speak to Mary and starting season 3 they are practicing for a wedding! If it hadn't been for the fact that I own the dvd's of Downton, I would have wondered what was going on. Hope this helps someone else who is contemplating buying the Blu-ray series.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I found the first episode of the first season to be &#34;okay&#34; but it didn't really keep my interest. Evaluating after the second episode when I really started looking forward to it from the third episode and on.<br />I especially like part played by Maggie Smith.  She was one of my favorite British actresses even before &#34;Harry Potter&#34;.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|This is a great Kurt Russell movie especially on Blu-ray widescreen. Every bit of this movie stands out so very clearly. The sound is very good along with the motion. I had this movie on regular DVD with widescreen on one side and full screen on the other. The disc became damaged, so I decided to replace it. I went for the much better Blu-ray over the DVD because I know they are better and I couldn't beat the price. I highly recommend this movie to all Kurt Russell and sci-fi movie aficionados.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I loved Scribblenauts on the DS but the bite sized gameplay is even better suited for smartphones. It's just an added bonus that all the assets are hi-res now.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I almost always read the book before I watch the movie. In this case I hadn't known there was a book until I'd already started watching OITNB on Netflix. Long story short, the show is better. I don't know if Piper considers herself a writer, but after reading this I wouldn't describe her as such. It's not so much the content I had a problem with; my problem is with how awful her writing is. At times it was hard to follow along and keep up with all the &#34;characters.&#34; New people were introduced into the story with little to no background information. Certain things lacked enough details. The flow was choppy; sometimes she would jump from one to another without a smooth transition. She also tried to show off her Smith education & &#34;extensive vocabulary&#34; a little too much. You can tell she was probably reaching for a thesaurus frequently while she was writing this. Her writing style made what could have been an exciting read, kind of dull and boring. Other than that, it's just a story of an entitled, privileged white woman who went to prison and probably for the first time in her life recognized that she'd been living under &#34;white privilege.&#34; It would be nice to know of she kept in touch with the women in prison she came to &#34;care for&#34; and &#34;love&#34; so much. She called them her friends, so I hope she kept up with them, reached out to the ones on the outside, etc. of course she doesn't mention anything like that in the book. Side note: had a black or Hispanic woman with the same story wrote such a book, I'm sure it wouldn't have been such a hit and had a tv series created because of it. You have to be a young, pretty white woman for Americans to have to care about your hardships ;)

B007VUA7VO|5.0|So easy to get and use.  My kindle stays charged so much longer.  Good choice.  You will never go wrong with this product.
1451695195|5.0|The book was in perfect condition and I loved it. It arrived on time too. I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about death and the mystery of life!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I would recommend this show.  We will watch it for many, many years to come.  Will never get tired of this show.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie John Carter.  Andrew Stanton did a great job turning the book into a movie. Yes, there are differences in the story between the book and movie, but there always will be.  John Carter most definitely deserves a sequel.  I bought the Blu-Ray as soon as I could and always at least stop for a few minutes whenever John Carter is in the premium channels.  I highly recommend the movie John Carter and don't let what other people have said deter you from seeing/purchasing the movie.  Check it out for yourself!!!
B000002JSP|5.0|I look at this as Led Zeppelin's final LP and it couldn't of been scripted any better,<br />Each member of the band has their talents exploited in this Album, In Through The Out Door will complete anyone's collection of Rock and Rolls Greatest Band, Led Zepplin
B00821OX98|5.0|At last, a Sci Fi show that has not been &#34;dumbed down&#34; so every 4 year old will like it. Well thought out, script and story line answer the questions a viewer would ask without exposing the last season g plot endings. Photography, sound, are Primo! Loved the last season with the twist of &#34;the second&#34; species of alien, and how some of them can relate to us while others still think we are lower life forms.  Thank Heavens for Amazon - so the old retired folks who can't afford Cable or Satellite can still see good programming from independent channels.  And much thanks to our kids for Amazon Gift Cards!
B003THHIEM|5.0|We really enjoyed in watching the very first episode of Castle. We like this show very much and have just recently been able to get it on our TV.  So now we can watch the first programs we did not get to see.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Shows the brutal warfare of early wars.  Mel Gibson is very good.  Keeps you riveted to the movie and characters.
B003477DVK|5.0|I rented this for my 2 year old grandson to watch (and fall asleep to). Well, he was too engrossed to fall asleep! There were several parts that I was concerned were too &#34;harsh&#34; for him (nothing graphic, but it was clear what was happening), and although my grandson is very sensitive, I also somehow got the sense that he understood the message. He loves this movie, and now every visit to Grammy's house has a request for &#34;My Dog Schip!&#34; at some point!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this game, I have one island that has hardly any room for houses. I just wish it wasn't so much money.
B00640UICA|1.0|I was excited to give this app a try, but it won't open on my Samsung Galaxy Tab. Darn it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Going to see 2 this weekend. What a hoot!!!!! All of my faves wrapped up in one package. Does it get any better?
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I thought it was a good book and reminds us to think about what is really important in our lives.
B004GIY5CQ|3.0|I thought this was an interesting Macbeth, visually. But the acting didn't engage me much. And some of my favorite lines and speeches were edited out. So, worth watching, but not definitive.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a book every thinking open minded Christian should read. The Jesus of this historical work is far more interesting and compelling than the Jesus of &#34;Jesus saves &#34; signs and biblical doctrine. Being born again is the easy way out. Good works and following Gods law is the real but hard way to salvation
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I love the Backstreet Boys and this CD is alittle different I think then what they have done in the past.  It has some really good upbeat songs that make you just want to sing with them.  I highly recommend this CD you won't be disappointed.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|It's billed as ad-free but it installs links to JumpTap, AdMob, and InMobi, all of which gather location and device information, plus Burstly and Milennial which \\"just\\" gather device information. Be very afraid.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I found this book on Good Reads. I generally try to stay away from books over 400 pages, but this was a very good book. It has a lot of twists. There are multiple romantic relationships, and there is a lot of mystery. But what really makes it are the beautiful words. It is just beautifully written and so many sentences leave you thinking-- I wish I had written that.
B00874T02K|5.0|Good for everyone, no matter if you can't do 10 push ups or you're an athlete who can do 50 and wants to get 100. Everyone will improve from using this.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|We need to see a more balanced approach to the movie industry.  Not to make one point over the other, but to engage curiosity, imagination, and alternative thinking.  To be dogmatic in just one thought process is not healthy.
B00008K7AM|1.0|Everything about this movie is horrible! It's pretty much just a bad rip-off of FREAKY FRIDAY! Rob Schneider is much better off in a funnier movie like GROWN UPS! Stay away from this film at all costs!
140006922X|3.0|I can understand why Zealot has made it to the best seller lists.  It is highly controversial, questioning and challenging many core beliefs of Christianity.  It is also easy to read, making Aslan's claims accessible to most readers.<br /><br />I applaud Aslan for his work in ferreting out Jesus as one whose ministry was focused on zeal for God.  This is neither a new concept nor a controversial one.  Very few would argue that Jesus confronted the status quo - especially the wealthy Jewish religious establishment and the militaristic Roman occupying force.  He did so through ethical teachings that turned society upside down and usurping the power of the ruling class.  This far I agree with Aslan.<br /><br />However, his understanding of the God of the Hebrew Scriptures is very different from mine.  He seems to see God as a jealous God who fights for the Hebrews at the expense of all others.  Aslan's God is bent on military might and conquering of all others.  This God does appear in the Hebrew Scriptures, but limiting God to this portrait is in my opinion scandalous and wrong.  Anselm is missing the God who sewed protective clothing for Adam and Eve, who promised protection through the Mark of Cain. He is missing the God who demands care for the orphans, the widows and the sojourners/foreigners.  He misses the God who provided manna in the wilderness.  By missing these parts of God, Aslan paints a portrait of a militaristic Jesus who only heals as an act of confrontation against the temple hierarchy, who ministers to the Samaritan woman at the well, who speaks of unconditional love in the story of the prodigal son.<br /><br />Aslan also seems to base his entire understanding of Jesus on selected passages of the New Testament, calling may passages pure fantasy and fictitious.  This reminds me of Deists like Thomas Jefferson, who cut all accounts of miracles out of his  Bible or Marcion who completely did away with the Hebrew Scriptures.  This kind of reading of Scripture is to me downright dishonest.<br /><br />Aslan also calls on us to discard the Jesus of our faith and rely exclusively on the historical, human Jesus.  He condescendingly attributes this to \\"balding gray-haired old men\\" at the Council of Nicaea.  Although Nicaea did not get it 100% correct, we don't need to throw out the baby with the bath water.<br /><br />And then there is Paul.  Aslan seems to completely ignore the fact that Paul remained a practicing Jew throughout his life and went to the synagogue first in almost every place he visited.  However, he understood that God's call was not limited to the Jews and argued this point forcefully.  In Romans, probably the most complete summary of his theology, Paul calls both Jews and Gentiles to task.  He says that we are all sinners and we are all needy of God's grace.  This contradicted the Jerusalem faction of Christianity, but it was an in-house fight.  As in almost all arguments, there is truth in both sides of the argument.<br /><br />So, I applaud Aslan's scholarship in pulling out many aspects of Jesus' life on earth, but I think his biases taint the overall work to an extent that makes it less than it could be.
