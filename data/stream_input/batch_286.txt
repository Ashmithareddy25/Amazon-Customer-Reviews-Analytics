B000060P79|5.0|This Album is wicked kool!! anyone who likes punk music will like this band!! The lyrics on this album you can so relate to like \\"Perfect\\" and \\"I'm just a kid\\". Simple Plan sounds alot like Good Charlotte, M.E.S.T., New Found Glory, and Midtown. And all those bands rock. Simple Plan is a great band, and they perform awesome when there live!! I addvise you to pick up this album or at least listen to it cause I'm sure you'll like it. Simple Plan kicks ...!!
B00005JL78|3.0|I loved this movie in the theaters.  If all you want from the DVD is to watch the movie, then by all means get it.  The movie is awesome, really a five-star movie.<br />That said, the DVD is surprisingly lacking.  There are NO, repeat NO scene-by-scene commentary tracks!  That is inexcusable for a two-DVD set.  There are lots of extras on the second DVD for sure, but the extras are pretty much constrained to that second DVD.  The first disc has the movie, and nothing else.<br />As a side note, I hate when DVDs are designed so that my subtitles button doesn't work, and I have to go through the menus to get the subtitles up.<br />James :\
0790743507|5.0|&quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; was one of the oldest musical films I first saw, and I'm glad one of them was this. I first saw it when I was 6 and watched dozens of times since. If you have to pick one single MGM musical, let it be this one. You won't regret it at all, and it is far beyond execellently made! Neatly crafted scenery, great songs and score, super-star cast, great storyline which is like a parody storyline that shows you the days of the first talking pictures and every studio's difficulty with that new technology since this film is set then. The whole movie is very colorful, and the two best secnes in the picture are probably in full agreement with every other amatuer and advanced movie review. They are: Gene Kelly walking down a street lit with streetlights in the pouring rain, not having a care singing the title song, and doing a classic song-and-dance routine that is matched at #1 on my list with the end dancing sequence in &quot;An American In Paris&quot;. The other best scene in &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; is the extravagant, exuberant, spectacular &quot;Broadway Melody&quot;. Full of nothing but music, music, MUSIC throughout with a lot of great songs sung by Gene Kelly and extras throughout. That sequence itself has a little story built on to the plot of &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; itself making it complex. There are many adjectives to describe this picture. I have 8: excellent, exuberant, joyful, carefree, spectacular, smashing, perfect, and fabulous! &quot;Gotta dance!&quot;
B0000029DD|1.0|Wow..Jeff Buckleys &quot;Grace&quot; should be renamed &quot;Disgrace&quot;. <BR>What a stinker this album is.  <BR>1 star is all this deserves, and that is being awfully generous.
B00000099Y|1.0|When I want to discover new bands, I usually read these reviews because in general are very helpful. And that's the reason why I bought &quot;Aenima&quot;. I though that all these 5 stars reviews couldn't be wrong, but in fact all of them are wrong.<br />After listening three or four songs you start to think that all the songs sound just the same. In fact when you reach song number eight you are sure that all the songs have the same (boring) sound. I don't know if the following songs are better because I haven't been able to go on listening.<br />I play guitar, and I usually focus my attention in the guitar player. In this case, I highly recommend focusing in another member (the drummer, is not that bad), because the guitar player is not talented and is boring. I don't know if he is playing random progressions, because after having listened 4 or 5 times I still haven't found any melody, chord or solo that deserves one minute of my time.<br />In my opinion, if you want to listen to talented musicians buy something from Dream Theater (Metropolis part II), Symphony X (V), Metallica (Master of Puppets), Opeth (Blackwater Park), Queen (Queen I).
B000021YQV|5.0|1.PRISON SONG:great bouncey, catchy song, with alot of drug refrences.

I can really see why this was the first single from this album. 10/10<br />7.BOUNCE:the funniest song on the album and it is very simialar to the song X. 10/10<br />8.FOREST:the longest lasting song on the album which is good, and it is one of my favorite songs live by system of a down, and this song has a great intro and has some good sound effects through out the song. 10/10<br />9.ATWA:i love it how this song goes from slow to fast with out warning you.

B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's Ten is a great CD. In 1991 when Nirvana and Pearl Jam hit the public eye both bands blew up. Every song on this cd is full of emotion, a trademark PJ seemed to lose in years to follow. Eddie Vedder has a great rock voice that can give you goosebumps.  \\"Grunge\\" was at it's begining and Ten will go down as a great one.  Pick up this cd if you don't have it.<br />And for that [person] that reviewed this by saying Pearl Jam [copied] Creed. Return this cd, because you know nothing about rock music.  Just like Creed.
B00005LMBK|3.0|this cd was one of the the first cd's that i purchased instead of burned. I kind of made a mistake purchasing this cd because someone told me it was a rock cd and i thought well hey the cover of the band looks cool so off i went and bought it. When i listened to it i thought it was ok and there where some great rap songs like clint eastwood which is a vicious rap song and then you have sound check which is a great song with great scratchings which sounds a bit spooky. Another great rap song is rock the house which is a very bluesy rap song, and then you have the song 19/2000 which is a great song which makes you feel like goin to the beach and yes it is a good song to listen to on the beach but then the rest of the songs are kind of like country music. So yes this album was kind of a mistake but turned out not bad so if you like techno, rap, jazz, blues, and even country, well then this album is for you. This is propbably one of the most alternative albums i have ever heard of. Some people think there is pure rock on the cd but i don't believe them because i am a very big rock lover and the only rock song which is more punk but any way is the called *punk*. So yeah its a good enough album if you like the types of music in this album that i just mentioned.
B00005QXDD|4.0|This is hilarious CD. JB and KG impressed me.  Very funny guys with some great skits. Just take it for what it is and try not to analyze it.
B00007E8V4|5.0|1.CHIC N STU:very wierd song talking about tv comercials, i like it how this song has a catchy tune and there is nothing about this song that i don't like. 10/10<br />2.INNERVISION:most people don't like this song but i really like this song and it has a great guitar rif, and great singing. 10/10<br />3.BUBBLES:i love this song this song so much, and the guitar riffs are great, and for some reason the singing reminds me of the band tenacious d, you know the ones who sang that hillarious song tribute. 10/10<br />4.BOOM!:this song replaces it music with some vocals which is not bad, but i love it how he half sings half talks through out the song and the lyrics are very interesting to. 10/10<br />5.NUGUNS: my least favourite song that i have ever heard from system of a down. 6/10<br />6.A.D.D.:a great song which has a kinda spooky intro, and i love the guitar riffs which sound punky. 10/10<br />7.MR JACK:most people love this song and count it as a favourite but i still don't see whats so terrific about it, but still it is a great song and i can't take that from them 9/10<br />8.I-E-A-I-A-I-O:this is the most fast talking song they have ever done, and the chorus is great, terrific song, one of my favourites. 10/10<br />9.36:the shortest song ever running for only 45 secondes but if it lasted longer it would be excellent. 8/10<br />10.PICTURES:excellent guitar riffs, the singing is not quite as good as usual, but the guitar riffs make up for that. 10/10<br />11.HIGHWAY SONG:the best ever acoustic song done by them with great singing. 10/10<br />12.F**K:the wackiest song on the album, and the singing is wierd because you can't understand what he is saying, but any way great song. 10/10<br />13.EGO BRAIN:its another acoustic song which is pretty good, but what ever instrument their using for the intro, i don't really like it. 8/10<br />14.THETAWAVES:very fast paced, and the guitar rif is pretty good and the fast talking is good as well. 10/10<br />15.ROULETTE:the most acoustic song ever, serj is singing a very strange love poem, but hey it sounds sweet but not my cup of tea. 7/10
0375707972|2.0|For a book that gets as many positive comments as this one does, I had high hopes, which were quickly dashed.  The writing is elementary, the characters poorly drawn.  Melodramatic.
B00005QG9J|2.0|this album is totally different to the others where as the others where more heavy and more fun to listen to where as this album makes you go to sleep. The only song i liked from the album was nice to know you and the rest where just way to weak and the lyrics are ... boring and if you are thinking of getting the album i recomend that you look for another album for example albums by system of a down they have never let me down in years and they have much more interesting lyrics which are about very interesting social issues and they are much more talented than incubus and there album toxicity has sold much more copies than this album, so yes i am really disapointed with this album and it was that bad that i returned it and got my money back and i learnt a lesson always listen to an album before you purchase it.
B00006EXCC|3.0|This album runs quite long for it's time (approx. 53 minutes), and that's part of the problem. \\"Going Home\\" clocks in at a very indulgent 11 minutes. I don't even think it's a good enough track to merit 3 or 4 minutes, honestly. Yet it rambles on and on. <br />But there are several classics on this album, the best known being \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" and \\"Under My Thumb\\". \\"Stupid Girl\\", \\"Lady Jane\\", \\"Out of Time\\", and \\"I am Waiting\\" are also great tracks.<br />A number of the tracks sound fairly undistiguished to me (Flight 505, What to Do, the above-mentioned Going Home). This album is still a way's away from the peak Stones of '68-72.<br />\\"I am Waiting\\" was used effectively in the motion picture \\"Rushmore\\".
0553573403|5.0|I couldnt believe how wonderfully this series started off. It was great. They stuck in characters perfectly in every situation and moves through the characters constanly which makes you read through the book faster than u can believe. What's sad though is how the author can kill off people so fast. Defianently, not your typical good and evil story. This book is a great start to a series that is sadly, going downhill. Hopely though with A Feast For Crows he can stick this series back up there with the best series.
B0000019PA|2.0|Ever listen to artistically-inclined seven year olds make up songs with no discernable direction or pitch center, just an inspired coil of words set to a fanciful wandering melody? I mean they all do it, and it can be amusing. THIS is NOT amusing. This is dumb. And I like a lot of the music that is considered in the same genre. Give me Flaming Lips, Spoon, Clinic, The Shins, Modest Mouse, Bright Eyes any ol' day. But these guys don't know what they're doing. The singer is just awful, and not Bob Dylan awful. More like some bored tweaker trying to sound like Wayne Coyne mixed with Lou Reed and Grace Slick. If you think this is inspired, check out the other bands I mentioned. Not underground enough? Then do whatever you possibly can do to find albums by Quankmeyer Faergoalzia. Extremely hard to find, but it will banish the notion that Neutral Milk Hotel are an interesting worthwhile band. They Aren't. I'd give this 1 star, but then what could I say about the Backstreet Boys? Listen to Skip Spence!
B00005JKNF|2.0|I'm sorry to have seen so much good talent wasted on such a boring movie. I love Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren and wasn't disappointed in their performance - Maggie in particular is masterful, but the story is littered with boring, confusing, and tedious conversations, never seeming to build up to anything. I was determined to stick it out to the end just in case there should be an interesting development in the &quot;mystery&quot; - but no such luck. Don't waste your time and money on this one!
B00005YW4H|3.0|Every new female singer of jazz (or  of some jazz) is touted as the best to come along in years. The interesting thing is that most of them are real knockouts ( Monheit, Jones, Krall) but if you really want to hear wonderful renditions of the standards buy some Susannah McCorkle ( a great loss to the music world) or my favorite Anne Hampton Calloway. Both of them know that phrasing matters . While they are all different it is what Billie and Ella knew as well . Jones, Monheit et al are all pretty voices.
B000002MFQ|5.0|This CD is basically like TB 1, but more modern. The downbeat, mixing and electronic music is all above the original 1973 CD. One nice feature instead of just 2 tracks there are many - so if you have a favorite part you can zoom into just that. Dark Star and The Bell are my two favorite tracks. Lot of melodies and counter melodies; very texturally rich music.<br />Mike Oldfield is a genius. I personally like Ommnadawn better; but I prefer this to TB1 - but I rate all three as 5 stars.<BR>Oldfield is not for everyone, but to those adventuresome, he is worth checking out.
6302794331|5.0|THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies to watch around the Holidays. It was theatrically released in 1992 and has become a  family regular favorite to watch. It takes the classic Charles Dickens novel and gives it a funny and heart-warming twist with memorable scenes, characters and music. The screenplay was adapted by Jerry Juhl (Muppet Treasure Island, Muppets From Space) and stays true the original classic.<br />The song score is by Paul Williams (The Love Boat, Bugsy Malone, The Muppet Movie) who brings a lot of charm, humor and wit to these toe tapping and memorable little gems.  \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\", \\"Just One More Sleep Till Christmas\\" and \\"Thankful Heart\\" are some of my favorite songs.<br />It stars the regular Muppet repertory cast with the talents of Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson and of course Frank Oz (Yoda, Director of In And Out and Bowfinger).<br />The starring role is masterfully played - with much delight - by Michael Cain (The Cider House Rules, Austin Powers Goldmember and Miss Congeniality). His outstandingly evil and then learns what it is to be nice - really nice by none other than the three magical ghost and Bob Cratchit himself - played by Kermit The Frog!<br />It is a fun and magical film and should be in every family's shelf for the Holiday Season. A real family pleaser! (1-3-02)
0800141660|5.0|What can I say but I loved this movie!  Whether or not you are a Jane Austen fan, you can appreciate the beauty of this film.  Emma Thompson has adapted a screenplay from Jane Austen's novel of the same title that deservedly won the Academy Award and she managed to turn in a subtle, nuanced performance as the elder Dashwood sister, Elinor.  Kate Winslet, pre-Titanic, is glorious and simply glows as the passionate middle sister, Marianne.  Hugh Grant is at his bumbling, awkward best as Edward, the man who quietly steals Elinor's heart.  But the best, by far, is Alan Rickman, whose Colonel Brandon is sensitive and intelligent.  You simply ache for him as he steps aside, despite his love for Marianne, to allow her to seek happiness with the caddish Willoughby.  In the background of these emotional maelstroms is a musical score that captures all of the drama so well your heartstrings will be tugged, in addition to lovely costumes and breathtaking scenery of the English countryside.  Simply put, if you want to watch a movie that will fill you with the same longing that Colonel Brandon suffered and love that makes you burn, as Marianne so wished for, this is the movie for you.
B00005JLRR|3.0|STAR TREK X: NEMISIS is the supposed last of the Star Trek films in the 36-year history of Star Trek originally conceived by Gene Roddenberry (Andromeda, Earth: Final Conflict) back in 1964. Directed by Stuart Baird (Executive Decision, US Marshals) the film has a dark tone. This film is definitely more interesting than the last installment (Insurrection), but not quiet as good as First Contact. I think the tone of the film is what missed its mark for me. There was too much talking between Shinzon played by Tom Hardy (Band Of Brother, Black Hawk Down) and Captain Picard played by the always-brilliant Patrick Stewart (X-Men 2, A Christmas Carol) and exposition and not enough for the other characters to do.<br />The star for this film was Data, played by Brent Spinner (Out To Sea, The Master Of Disguise) playing a duel role as the ever-misfitted android and a duplicate brother called B4. The scenes of his light-hearted humor, curiosity, quick wit and heroism make this film very enjoyable. Problem because Brent was also one of the three who came up with the story idea as well with producer Rick Berman (Enterprise, Deep Space Nine, Voyager) and screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The Time Machine 2001, Any Given Sunday).<br />The story is simple  but a little weird. Captain Picard was cloned by the Romulans (the Bad Guys) in order to be replaced in the Federation an infiltrate the Good Guys. Due to a change of politics and governments  the plan was abandoned and the clone grew up under hardship to become the future destructor of planet Earth. Yawn.<br />Now the real action takes place more than halfway into the movie where the Enterprise rams Shinzons ship. From that point the forward the movie is a roller coaster. And, thanks to Data, who destroys the most deadly weapon known in the Universe  the Earth is saved. Data even has a moment where the audience cheered!<br />The supporting cast gets second seat in this film and even Jonathan Frakes (Clockstoppers, Thunderbirds) gets a decent fight scene in this, but not a great contributor to the plot overall. Mr. Frakes did a great job directing First Contact.<br />There are cute scenes, wedding reception scenes, love making scenes, there is even some off-roading too   but over-all it takes the last 40 minutes to get you involved. Also there is an emotional ending that may shock Star Trek fans  the two who didnt know anything about it.<br />The score is by the incredible Jerry Goldsmith (Logans Run, Explorers, Patton) and the special effects are top notch and completely believable. Overall Star Trek fans should be satisfied and the non-Trekker will enjoy the detailed ending  just wished it had me humor and more for the other characters to do. Go see it and tell me what you think! (12-22-02 Revised 1-3-02)Clockstoppers, Thunderbirds) gets a decent fight scene in this, but not a great contributor to the plot overall.

0375703861|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, but I just didn't buy into some of the characters. Smith is quite ambitious to write about the thoughts and dreams of middle-aged men and women when she herself is under 30, but sometimes the depictions are convincing.<br />Little errors bothered me repeatedly. I don't swallow that any Muslim who considers himself or herself even remotely observant would adopt a sacreligious name like \\"Abdul Trevor\\" (which would imply that the person by this name is a worshipper of Trevor). Still, at least the Muslims in this novel were presented with some sense of dignity, as opposed to the Jewish characters, who are ruthlessly lampooned (I suppose Smith tries to make up for this in her second novel, about Kabbalist autograph hounds, which I have not read).<br />On the other hand, the plot does flow and I found \\"White Teeth\\" to be light reading and not at all difficult to finish. Not a great book, but neither is it the misery that some of the other readers on this website would portray it as.

Both the critical and the backgrounds and contexts essays are well chosen.

0385503954|3.0|I have gone through the reviews for this novel and read the ones that HATE it and then read the ones that LOVE it. Well, I am somewhere in-between. I, by no means, feel that this is the best book ever written. However, it is one of the best books of the year 2002 (perhaps even deserving of the claims that is the BEST book of 2002). <BR>I will not go through a synopsis of the novel because quite a few people have done that already. One of the problems that I faced while reading the book was that the main character, Briony, was not very likable. Yes, she commits a huge mistake and the \\"atonement\\" that the title is referring to is atonement for her mistake- yet, as a reader, I felt no sympathy for her character and did not care whether or not she came to terms with her error. She was (as others on ... have described her) a typical thirteen year old spoiled brat and did not progress beyond that during the course of the book. Furthermore, there are general inconsistencies with her character. On the one hand, this character contemplates her place in the universe and the concept of \\"self\\" (very lofty philosophical thoughts) - on the other hand, she cannot recognize that her sister is interested in Robbie and is not a victim in his hands. A lot of the thoughts that are presented from Briony's point of view do not go with the \\"crime\\" that her character commits. <BR>The good points of the novel are, of course, that the book is written extremely well, the language and style are wonderful and the plot is very interesting. Over all, a very solid and good book. I would recommend it if you are looking to have a good read over the weekend, but I would also recommend that you wait for paperback and/or go to the library for a copy. It is not worth it to buy the hardcover.
0066214122|1.0|I read Prey filled with the expectation that this would be an excellent book...  I have learned in life that if you expect something great you will get something great.  However this did not hold true when applied to this stinker of a novel.<br />Unsurprisingly this novel was &quot;hi-tech&quot; and required many many descriptions of what exactly was happening with the science.  That was ok, I expected that.  However I didn't expect to have the answers to the problems to be so obvious.  I guessed what was wrong with Julia long before it was actually explained.    The characters were dry and one dimensional.  By the end of the novel I didn't care what happened to them.  The only reason I gave it one star is because of the original idea, nano-technology gone out of control.  This could have been a much better book. God forbid Chrichton creates a sequal to this one.
B000002VCW|5.0|Al Stewart's Musical Masterpiece !! Various keyboards,string arrangements,guitars,violin,harmonica,alto sax,back ground vocals and the wonderfully creative drumming and percussion parts. A marvelous mixture of instruments makes for a marvelous mix of music. Produced by Alan Parsons and recorded at Abbey Road Studios London! No wonder it's so good! A Great sounding re-issue on cd. The engineering,technical and recording expertise used is phenominal!! Each song is slightly different from the one before it which keeps the listener in a pleasent state of anticipation and arousal. This cd comes to us exactly the way it was meant to be,just like the original vinyl LP. No bonus tracks are needed for this one. A solid 9 tracks of GREAT MUSIC!! What a unique idea/decision it was to end this album with Year Of The Cat. The same as the title of the album. It really leaves you wanting more and more and more. Final thought: A Well orchestrated must have cd. BUY IT!!!...

B000000WA4|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins (to me) had something that put them above almost every other major alternative band of the 1990's. Maybe it's because they were the only band brave enough to go beyond the usual aggressive angst-filled pounding and venture into other areas like classical, folk, electronica/dance, dream pop, jazz and other genres that are hard to categorize. Or maybe it's because when they amp it up and go super-heavy (as ex-Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford says) it's also ethereal, dreamy, celestial and angelic sounding. Who else has married these seemingly odd contradictions? Whatever the actual reason, they left me awe-struck from day one.<br /><br />_Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness_ is an ambitious, diverse and intense 122-minute album that runs the gamut -- emotionally and musically. Billy Corgan actually wrote all of it (with the exception of two tracks) by himself, as well as co-producing it. Some of the tracks from each disc:<br /><br />Disc One (Dawn To Dusk) features mostly heavy hitters, but there are diverse moments on here as well. \\"Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness\\" starts this wonderful journey off as a soothing, elegant and sad-sounding piano piece. It has a classical flavor to it as well. \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" is brilliantly orchestrated with strings added to the mix. It gives this track an overwhelming intensity. I don't really need to say much more about this track. \\"Jellybelly\\" is one of the Pumpkins' most ephemeral and unsung heavy hitters. This track is ultra-heavy and intense, as the track is drenched in a sea of sludgy guitars. But, I hate to call it sludge, because it's so beautiful and otherworldly-sounding. Near the end of the track, there's an ascending lick that builds until finally reaching a climax that sounds nearly orchestral. This is because it's so smothered in the flooded mix, it sounds dimly audible -- which I mean in a good way. \\"Here Is No Why\\" seems to have a retro sound. I didn't like this too much at first, but now I realize that it really couldn't be produced any other way. \\"To Forgive\\" is a slow r&b-esque ballad that I could imagine Prince doing. \\"An Ode To No One\\" is pure, cathartic and angry metal. One of the most crunchy and aggressive tracks the Pumpkins have ever done. \\"Love\\" is a slow dance/electronica piece featuring some sultry vocals from Billy Corgan during the chorus. \\"Cupid De Locke\\" -- I can't even describe what this is. Neo-psychedelia? Classical? It's romantic, poetic and dreamy-sounding for sure. \\"Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans\\" is as evocative as the title suggests -- a 9-minute prog-rock epic with metal guitar, dreamy vocals and enchanting soundscapes. \\"Take Me Down\\" is the mellow and soothing closer of the disc sung by guitarist James Iha.<br /><br />Disc Two (Twilight To Starlight) features the more softer and diverse elements. But, don't let all this fool you -- there are some explosive and intense rockers on here as well. \\"Where Boys Fear To Tread\\" is a strange-sounding edgy rocker. \\"Bodies\\" is scathing. \\"Thirty-Three\\" was conceived when Billy Corgan said that a psychic predicted that his life would change at the age of 33. Ironically, the Pumpkins broke up when Billy hit that age. Anyway, the track is a soothing, reflective dream pop ballad with small touches of folk. \\"1979\\" is the dance/pop track that became a popular hit for the band. \\"Tales Of A Scorched Earth\\" is a scathing industrial metal-ish track. Volatile, explosive and intense, some may be put off from this. \\"Thru The Eyes Of Ruby\\" seems like something some of the best progressive rockers of the 70's never wrote. Retro-sounding, but very hard to describe at the same time. It's a 7-minute epic with sonic architecture to be envied over. It closes with a dreamy and atmospheric acoustic ending. \\"Stumbleine\\" sounds like just a voice and guitar track from Billy Corgan. \\"X.Y.U.\\" is ultra-intense, volatile, hellish and enraged. It'll be hard to keep your adrenaline down, as this track will make you want to throw your fist through a window. It's THAT intense. The Pumpkins sure ended all this with a bang, as the rest of the tracks are soft, soothing and sweet. \\"We Only Come Out At Night\\" is just pretty. \\"Beautiful\\" is an r&b-esque track featuring some hypnotic effects. Once again, I'm reminded of Prince. \\"Lily (My One And Only)\\" sounds like a mixture of show tunes and classical with a synthesized-like drum beat layered on top of it all. Beautiful stuff. \\"By Starlight\\" reminds me of some of those 70's sappy ballads. I'm not saying this in a degrading way, as I really like this. \\"Farewell And Goodnight\\" features vocals from three members of the band. Definitely a song to send you to sleep (in a good way.) Billy Corgan has said that the last five songs on this disc were meant to put the listener to sleep. Couldn't tell whether he was being serious or sarcastic.<br /><br />It broke my heart terribly to see a fantastic band like this break up. The Smashing Pumpkins were truly a one of a kind band. _Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness_ is an album that should show off the brilliance of this band perfectly.

0316666343|5.0|An amazing read.  Highly original and totally engrossing.  I literally couldn't put it down.  The fantasy that all of us have of our loved ones watching us from above is played out with great sensitivity and realism, while balancing perfectly with the events unfolding among the living.  Raw, honest and beautifully written.  You'll want it to be true.
B00000F1D3|5.0|I pulled this album out after not listening to it for a couple of years. I honestly forgot that I even owned it. I have to say, it's absolutely hard NOT to like this. The music on here features catchy and addictive melodies that will possibly have you singing along, as well as dance grooves that'll get you jumping. Now, I consider myself an open minded listener, but disco music is the only music I can think of that makes my stomach turn. I say this because some of the music on here incorporates mild disco influences combined with the electronica/dance pop. I may be in a minority when I say that Cher has a voice that nearly sends me to tears. It's emotional, husky, sensual and versatile. Her singing on one of her earlier songs, \\"After All\\" (which is probably my all-time favorite romantic ballad) sends chills down my whole body.<br />Many of the tracks on here deal with the subject of love. Onto some of the tracks. The title track is pretty much a dance/pop classic - at least in my book. The track is catchy, addictive and moving. Once again, I may be in a minority when I say that listening to Cher's vocals pressed up against the spiralling soundscapes give me goosebumps. The song is also triumphant. \\"All Or Nothing\\" pretty much has those same trippy, hypnotic electronic effects fronted by Cher's strong vocal presence. \\"Dov'e L'amore\\" is a romantic latin-tinged ballad. My friend used to play this track to death, eventually getting slightly on my nerves with this. Now, since he's moved away, and I listen to this track on my own, I love it as well. It could be for either sentimental reasons, me being a subconscious romantic, or I'm just taken by the sensual melodies & vocals -- which are sung in two different languages. \\"Taxi Taxi\\" is somewhat cerebral in scope. For one, Cher seems to be hitting ranges that I've never heard her hit before. Secondly, there's an abrupt switch from a major chord to a minor chord (from the same root note), which makes this sound like you've swapped dimensions  -- this probably makes no sense. Anyway, this transition takes place from the verse to chorus respectively.<br />I'm going to be abrupt and end this review right now, given that I think this review is terrible and it'll probably do no justice to Cher or this album. I will say that this album is EXTREMELY addictive, catchy and melodic. Contagious like strep throat would be more like it. Every track on here is great. Recommended for sure!swapped dimensions  -- this probably makes no sense.

B000069HK2|5.0|Uhhhh...Why is Good Charlotte listed under similar band? Im not seeing it...ANYWAYS...This band is incredible, and definently the best screamo band that Ive ever heard. Berts vocals are incredible;his screams are glass shattering and he can sing suprisingly high. The top songs I think are the orchestrated ones(&quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot;, &quot;Greener with the Scenery&quot;, and &quot;On My Own&quot;),but there is honestly no weak tracks on this album. <BR>          Other good screamo bands: Glass Jaw, Thursday, Finch, Taking Back Sunday, Coheed and Cambria and My Chemical Romance

B00005JKES|5.0|First off, I love Twin Peaks.  I saw the set ... and bought it on the spot.  I remember seeing only the second season on TV and never wanted to buy the VHS tapes because I knew that it would eventually make it out on DVD.  So...I get the set home, and pop in the first DVD.  I hit the button for episode 1 and am rewarded with...\\"Previously, on Twin Peaks!\\"...What the [heck]?  Apparently the pilot episode is not considered part of the first season.  What [person] thought this was a good idea?  I am really [upset] that this set does not contain what I consider to be the first episode...  I am a little upset that the studio would release the DVD set and not make the pilot available.  <BR>In short, if you don't mind buying an import go ahead and buy the set, if you think it's [dubm] for the studio to release the first season without the pilot then run away from this deal fast.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I had to write this review based on an absolutely scathing review that took potshots at the director. First if you are going to see the movie to see how true it stayed to the story line you will be disappointed. But if you are going to see the movie to see how it was adapted and because you enjoy epic adventures and well made movies then by all means go. I read the book before seeing the movie to contrast and compare, and while yes I was disappointed at the artistic license, the movie more than made up for it in terms of sheer power. The CGI interpretation of Gollum alone was enought to bring me back two times for it and counting. I eagerly look forward to the next movie, of which I am about a 1/3 of the way thru the book. Rarely does a movie completely embrace its literary origins. ...just be glad to see the movie for the movies sake and not for the book.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I never imagined that the truth would finally come out. For years and years I beLIEved that Jim Morrison was in fact alive and well, living in Paris, laying low. Even though I felt this fact in my bones I never thought that my insticts would be confirmed.

0688170528|3.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my absolute favorite authors and as such it pains me to write an unfavorable review of one of her books. I just didn't find this to be as compelling as other books of hers that I have read. I actually found myself skimming the last few chapters trying to find something to sink my teeth into. <br />Its the story of a suicide pact between two teenagers that has gone awry. Chris and Emily's families have been friends since before they were born and the two were inseparable as kids growing up. In adolescence they become more than friends as was hoped by both families. It is Emily's idea to commit suicide and its her death that distroys the two families friendship and the life of Chris, the survior of the Pact. <br />Maybe my expectations were too high knowing what Ms. Picoult is capable of writing, but this book just didn't capture my attention like others have. I found there to be far too many loose ends and unanswered questions. Often the book seemed to be taking off in a very interesting direction only to divert back on the main course, never returning to the interesting parts. Additionally, many of the characters were underdeveloped or superflous to the plot. <br />Overall, I'd rate it a C.
B00005JL78|3.0|Minority report, set in the near future, predicts a society heavily regulated, policed and fundamentally structured on curtailing civil liberties. The usual background for a SF film set in the future!<br />The film is rather unconvincing, in either plot or thematically. The acting is adequate, though Cruise does appear to lack any real conviction. <br />The effects are quiet superb, which warrants perhaps the real reason for seeing this film
B00005K3O4|5.0|If any of you out there are a fan of the movie, this a perfect addition to your DVD collection. This movie shows that even low budget &quot;horror&quot; films can become a cult classic. There is nothing like sitting down late on a Friday night to watch the movie with your boyfriend/girlfriend and watching them squeam as you laugh hysterically. Highly recommend purchasing.
0767906543|4.0|This is a fun read. The pace of the book cracks along, as the lead character, a struggling, if not bubbling 28 year old, works through a failing relationship owing to his inability to `commit' to marriage to his true love.<br />Gayle has the right knack of making a very simple plot into an engaging read. It is very easy to sympathize with the main characters that in the main are believable, and developed. The writing style is fun and precise. <br />It's great that Gayle has successfully put a male viewpoint into this popular fiction genre.
B00000IL67|4.0|These are my opinions, I don't speak for Alice Cooper himself...So let's begin:<BR>First of all, the packaging is great, the overview is well-done, and the production is top-notch. Now, as for the song choice:<BR>I agree that they do go rather briskly over his days with the original band, but the set also skips over his underrated early 80's music. Let's be fair here, there is a lot more from his early band days in this set than there is from his obscure early 80's albums. Don't tell me it's a matter of quality, a lot of his music from the early 80's boast his unique sense of humor and his ability to be creepy and his ability to rock hard. Just because they weren't as well-known doesn't mean they weren't also good. So, before anyone complains about there not being enough from Love It to Death, Killer, School's Out, Billion Dollar Babies, or Muscle of Love, don't forget Flush the Fashion, Zipper Catches Skin, Dada, or Special Forces. Also, about his late 80's albums, they are also underrated. Some of his music from that time was as sly and cunning as his early music. Sure it wasn't very timeless, but it all really comes down to is that Hair Metal of the late 80's (which is under-appreciated at times nowadays) is only at fault when the band takes itself too seriously, which we all know Alice Cooper is incapable of, being the great rock showman/comedian/shocker/god he is and was and still is.<br />In closing: this box st is a very good (I might even say \\"brief\\") overview of the greatness that is Alice Cooper. Let no man (or woman) say he was nothing more than a sideshow that just followed every fad of the time. No matter how fad-like the medium in which he expressed his musical ability, he will always be remembered.
0385508417|5.0|Loved this book.  I read it a year ago and laughed and cried.  It will be standard holiday reading each year.  To me, Luther Krank wanted to do what most of us only dream about...skip Christmas just for once.  I loved the neighbors - we all have a Fromeyer in our neighborhoods...  I laughed out loud at the scene of Luther trying to hastily get the Snowman up.  I wish I could tell Grisham to ignore all the nay-sayers and let him know that it was a marvelous and touching holiday story.  Love, love, love this book!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Easily one of Disney's new classics and one of the most fun as well. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has been brought back in a new 2 Disc set that has the original movie with the new song &quot;Human Again&quot; and also a lot of fun extras.<br />This is one of my all time favorite Disney movies and this is a great one for the kids and the whole family. The storty starts with a young Prince who was very selfish. One night a poor old woman came to his castle and asked for shelter from the rain and she offered him a single rose in return. The Prince turned her away and the old woman's appearance melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. To show him that he had to learn how to love inner beauty, she turned into a hideous Beast. Now he must learn to love and have someone love him in teturn or he would remain a Beast for the rest of his life.<br />This is really a favorite of mine because it's seriously very good all around. The music and musical numbers are very fun and entertaining and the new song &quot;Human Again&quot; is also very fun as well. The story is very good and the characters are fun as well. I don't think anyone could not enjoy this movie.<br />This gets a big thumbs up, 5 stars of fun! Check out BEAUTY AND THE BEST PLATINUM and if you're looking for other great Disney classics, check out DUMBO, SLEEPING BEAUTY, SNOW WHITE and even some of the new Disney/Pixar movies like MONSTERS INC, TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 and A BUG'S LIFE.
B000050X31|5.0|This is by far one of the best operas of all time. And thats to I dont know who, this is one of the best Zauberflotes around. Araiza is a great Tamino, his voice is batifull and he dosnt shout. Battle is a good Pamina also. The most interesting singers are of course Kurt Moll and Luciana Serra. Kurts sarastro is deep and moving, and Lucianas Queen of the Night is fabulous. Manfred Papageno is well acted and with good voice, something that is not very importanr in that role, but i apreciate it.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Casino Royale is one of the oddest choices in the 007 movie bag. It is unofficial and a spoof of the James Bond series. Quite a complicated film to make with 5 directors, endless producers and screenwriters, and an endless cast in the movie with dozens of cameos. Lee Pfeiffer once commented on the film that &quot;If you were in London at the time of the movie production, you had a part in the movie.&quot; Indeed Casino Royale is an over-budget big flop of the James Bond series, it stands up very well for itself. David Niven, Ursula Andress, Orson Wells and Woody Allen bring undeniable charm, class and comedy to the film. There is basically no plot for the film, but the comedy and spoofs make up for it. The gambling scenes and over the top finale are some of the highlights of the film. The true winner is the powerful score by Burt Bacharach. A real winner with Dusty Springfield and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. A crazy film with nonstop thrills, comedy and excitement! A real winner.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|It is common knowledge for those who visits the Metropolitan Opera frequently enough that the standard of its performance varies. Even the presence of the biggest stars cannot guarantee that the evening is a success, either because of production flaws or that the singers are below their best.<br />I'm afraid this is the case for this Ring production. Watching it live on the stage, one may overlook some, but not all, of its defects, having been overwhelmed by Wagner's great music dramas and also the sense of occasion. However, the weaknesses of this production are all exposed on DVD when one views it at home.<br />The production is a boring one - the direction is unimaginative and in quite a few instances leave one distinctly underwhelmed. The singing is also ordinary. Some of the singers are below their best or have past their prime. Some are over-stretched by their roles while some have little charm in terms of stage presence and acting. It is a very uneven production and enjoyable episodes are separated by bland and tedious moments. <br />As a document of Wagner's great music-drama cycle, this production leaves much to be desired.
0887307280|4.0|As an entrepreneur, I wish I would have read this book before I started my business. Unfortunatley I learned- the hard way - many of the insights this book provides through making errors in my own business.<br />A small caveat. The approach this book takes is from a technician - a person with a particular skill to make a product or service.  It focuses on how these people need to become entrepreneurs, and managers to round out their skills to make a successful company.  However, as I was more entrepreneur than technician, I kept having to &quot;read between the lines&quot; on how certain points could be applied to my situation.<br />The most vital thing I took from this book, was &quot;The true product of a business was the business itself.&quot;
B00007GZQI|3.0|I've always enjoyed watching this film but I really don't know why. For a comedy it isn't really all that funny (especially considering John Cleese and Graham Chapman of \\"MONTY PYTHON\\" contributed some bits to the screenplay). I guess it has a lot to do with the \\"guest stars\\" that pop up now and then, like director Roman Polanski, Lawrence Harvey, Spike Milligan, Yul Brynner, Richard Attenborough and (best of all) British horror legend CHRISTOPHER LEE and the beautiful RAQUEL WELCH. Lee is a vampire (what else?) on board the \\"ship\\" The Magic Christian near the end. He looks very elegant stalking the corridors, his long black cape billowing about him as goes. And Rocky (er, Miss Welch) is the Priestess of the Whip, in charge of the top-less female galley slaves rowing in the engine room. Dressed in her Amazon garb, she is breath-taking to behold! Confronted by a male passenger who demands to know what is going on, she flicks her whip at him, he rips his shirt open and kneels before her and begs her to do that again. These two cameos are very brief, but they are the best parts of this rather meandering and dull comedy. The DVD is a bare bones disc. No notes, no trailer. No extras to speak of. But on the back of the box it lists the \\"SPECIAL FEATURES\\" as the full screen version, the interactive menus, scene access and then states that these SPECIAL FEATURES are \\"NOT RATED\\". Not Rated? There are no special features to rate! Otherwise, the digitally remastered picture is nice and the film sounds good. Oh yeah, and the songs are very good (Paul McCartney's \\"COME AND GET IT\\" and Badfinger's \\"CARRY ON\\" heard under the main titles). So, I can't really recommend this DVD, unless you like Mr. Lee or Miss Welch (as I do) and must see every movie they make. Anyone else, stay clear.
B00002Z88D|5.0|The first time I bought the CD I went crazy. I am a \\"new\\" Metallica fan, I have been listening to their music for a while, but S&amp;M was my first Metallica CD to buy. <br />Listen to the musical introduction of \\"Ecstasy of Gold\\", followed by \\"The call of Ktulu\\". James' voice *haaahh* comes out after 10 minutes in \\"Master of Puppets\\". <BR>Listen to the new track \\"no leaf clover\\"; it is my favorite HOW I LOVE IT!! \\"Nothing else matters\\" as a classic song is great, and here it adds orchestra to make the sound better, as I believe *God!*  \\"Memory remains\\", and \\"until it sleeps\\" are just as cool as the original version.<br />Bottom line here: The first time I thought about this CD, I couldn't imagine how it would look like. But, hey guys, this is great! This CD mixes black and white pieces of music together; San Francisco Symphony Orchestra with the hard rock sound of Metallica. What do you have? Simply, S&amp;M is one of the best live albums ever! Go Metallica!
B00005RHGK|1.0|If I could rate this movie at less than one star, I would.  This movie is ....  There is no plot, and it is not scary.  All in all, I would rate it about as low as a movie can go.
B000002MG1|5.0|This CD is the coolest...The best song is on this CD...NightSwimming.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|My wife and I have seen this movie MANY times and we laugh harder each time we see it. This movie must be a cult classic, mainly because if we act out a piece of a scene or speak a line from it (as we often do) many people are 'in' on the joke having seen it repeatedly themselves.  Alexander Gudenov really steals the scenes that he's in portraying Shelly Long's ex-husband/Symphony conductor. I love it when he admonishes the orchestra at lunchtime after a lackluster rehearsal and tells the members to '...go stuff yourselves, I hope you choke!' (in that wonderful accent).<BR>I highly reccommend this film to anyone, especially if you own a house. Those laughing the loudest will have had home repair experience I'm sure. Tom Hanks at his funniest. You won't be dissapointed!<br />Favorite moments:<br />bathtub scene (with pop-up thermometer in the turkey)<BR>raccoon scene<BR>The Shirk brothers contractors<BR>All of the Alexander Gudenov scenes<BR>'The Cheap Girls' band<BR>borrowing money from 'Benny'<BR>Hanks and Long fighting in front of the contractors<br />.....the list goes on......
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslave, the collaboration of surviving RATM members and former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, brings lots of sound and fury. Unfortunately, the record as a whole doesn't signify anything greater than its parts. This is not to say it's not a good record. At moments, it is spectacular, easily some of the best rock 2002 offered. The opening 1-2-3 punch of \\"Cochise\\", \\"Show Me How to Live\\", and \\"Gasoline\\" are hard to match, as are the more classic rock sounding standouts, \\"Like a Stone\\" and \\"I Am the Highway\\". The rest of the album, unfortunately is not quite on par; they're all solid songs, but they often sound unfinished and more like a side-project and not a band that plays comfortably together.  <br /> Some critics have described Audioslave as RATM with Chris Cornell singing, or Tom Morello playing guitar with Soundgarden. Both such descriptions fit. On their debut, they sound like a supergroup, not a polished band. Even Morello himself seems to have lost some creativity. His guitar riffs still resonate, but even they seem to flow too closely to Sabbath's riff catalog. In the end, the guitar virtuoso seems to have somewhat run out of ideas. The glue here in this collaboration surprisingly is Cornell, whose emotive singing breathes life into the dirgy, thick material. <br /> Taken against other modern rock, Audioslave is amongst the elite. Juxtaposed against either of their former bands, both Soundgarden and Rage packed more punch and left a greater impression. Still, any and all from either band or their respective band members is worthwhile. Recommended.
0761536434|5.0|I have always enjoyed video games, be it arcade, hand-held, or home gaming systems. And lately, I have been getting more and more into home electronic games. As such, I was very interested when I found this title on Amazon.com for under $...(U.S.)<br />The Ultimate History of Video Games is an impressive name for any book, and weighing in at 624 pages, you would think that Steven L. Kent has written just that. Without reading very many other books about the history of video games and the companies that create them, I would have to say that for me, this is an accurate statement.<br />The book, however, ends a little early. Neither the X-BOX nor the Nintendo GameCube had hit the streets when this title was published in September 2001. Unfortunate, as I think the current state of video games is more interesting than the Pokemon craze that this book ends on.<br />For those wondering just what happened at Atari, this book will tell you. How in the world did Nintendo ever revive video games after the almost-death of the industry after the early 1980÷s? When did SEGA become a big player, and where are they now? How did the Sony PlayStation ever get a foothold in the gaming market, and how did they end up trouncing Nintendo at the beginning of this decade? Who were the people that created all those great games? What is the best selling video game of all time? The Ultimate History of Video Games will tell you.<br />I would rather have seen this book broken up into multiple books. Ten-year increments to the story would have been nice, which would have given the author more time and space to really delve more into each company and game along the way. While Atari, Activision, Coleco, and other pioneering video game companies are represented well in the story, I would have loved more in-depth coverage. (Besides Atari, which is the entire first two-thirds of this book, but for good reasons.)<br />All negativity aside, I really enjoyed this book. It was a pleasure to read. Unlike some other history books which cover other industries, and some which cover the video game world as well, this book is filled with human interest stories, not just how many units of the Atari 2600 version of PacMan sold.<br />Steven L. Kent is a gifted writer who put a lot of time and passion into this book. I think he did a great job, and the only real gripe I have is that the book ended before I wanted it to. With luck, he has plans on reviving newer editions every few years to chart the progress of the industry.<br />If you are at all curious about the history of video games, you will want this book. Don÷t buy it hoping to find color photos or screen snapshots of Donkey Kong. This book is almost all text, for a very good reason. This is the Ultimate History of Video Games, after all, and 624 pages barely cover it.<br />Hats off, Mr. Kent. A job well done.<br />Highly recommended!<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Tim Robertson<br />[...]ike some other history books which cover other industries, and some which cover the video game world as well, this book is filled with human interest stories, not just how many units of the Atari 2600 version of PacMan sold. <br />Steven L.

B00006LIRI|3.0|A band like U2 brings forth high expectations every time they release a new record. Unfortunately, their latest, a 1990-2000 Greatest Hits compilation falls noticeably short. There is something missing from this collection. It sounds loose, forced, uncohesive, everything a U2 Greatest Hits collection should not be. The pacing isn't especially strong, and some of their strongest songs from this time period are omitted, \\"Last Night on Earth\\", \\"Please\\", \\"The Fly\\", \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\", \\"Zooropa\\", \\"Kite\\", \\"When I Look at the World... the list goes on. Moreover, there is an overabundance of remixes that do not add to the originals, and new songs, \\"Hands that Built America\\", \\"The First Time\\" are hardly standout material. In summation, the album reads like a quick attempt to cash on the holiday frenzy, and little else. Those passionate about the band would do much better to pick up \\"Achtung Baby\\" especially, and save their money on a better and more daring collection of songs. A very pedestrian effort from the usually ambitious Irish rock legends. Not essential.
B000000WCX|5.0|After the breakup of the influential pre-alternative Tin Machine, Bowie boldly pushed his solo career headfirst into the 90s.  Always the chameleon and constant usurper of styles, David Bowie's 90s output has been startlingly original following a fairly regular pattern and referencing a wealth of influences all their own.  Perhaps the legendary tweaker of ideas sudden embrace of pure originality was a response to his confessed betrayal of artistic integrity in the 80s, but regardless of the artist's motive, Bowie's new work ranks amongst his best material without simply repeating it.  One of the strongest albums from Bowie's 90s repertoire also stands as one of his most creative.  \\"Earthlings\\", the 1997 industrial masterpiece, picks up where the dance experiments of prior albums like 1993's \\"Black Tie White Noise\\" had left off.  Continuing to employ heavily synthesized drums and plodding, monotonous bass lines, Earthlings' establishes an undercurrent of the trademark dense groove that Bowie has made his own.  However, the big difference between Bowie's previous journeys into the club/dance scene and Earthlings is that Earthlings, has a bite to it.  Emphasizing every single rapid-fire drum fill and each individual bass dive are mountains of dense, stacked guitars that would make even Billy Corgan proud. These heaping mounds of feedback lend an invigorating amount of power to the otherwise light, catchy songs, really driving Earthlings' point home.  Finally, once injected with intelligent songwriting and Bowie's smooth, blue eyed soul crooning, Earthlings becomes a truly admirable blend of Alt. rock guitar fury, industrial electronica, and gothic atmospheres that sound new and timeless all at once.  Not only is Earthlings a great album on its own terms though, but it is a truly original and new idea from an artist that could easily pull in wads of cash with nothing more than remakes of his critically acclaimed classics.  Instead of wasting time on nostalgic tours in support of a \\"new\\" compilation like the Rolling Stones or The Who, David Bowie takes a cue from fellow rock veterans King Crimson and keeps doing what he does best, creating new and interesting music.  If you're looking to hear the sounds of the 70s that you so fondly remember from your classic rock radio station, then don't bother continuing to follow Bowie's expansive career. On the contrary though, if you truly want to hear some innovative music by a tried and true musical genius, then Earthlings is a brilliant place to start.
B00005K3LU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I had already seen it several times on TV, but it's even better on DVD!!! The picture is awesome, the sound is incredible, you just can't do any better!         Plot: New York cop, John McClane(Bruce Willis) comes to L.A. to be with his wife(Bonnie Bedelia) and kids for christmas. He stops at his wife's office where a christmas party is in progress. But there are some uninvited guests. A group of thieves posing as terrorists. The terrorist leader, Hans Gruber(Alan Rickan) terrifies the party guests and tries to get his hands on approx. 640 million dollars in bearer-bonds. But he wasn't counting on John McClane being there....     Rating Flags: Graphic Violence(An extremely graphic bullet-to-the-head, bullets stream through a man's legs in slow motion, McClane is forced to walk across broken glass in bear feet, many gory gunshot wounds, etc.), Very Strong Language(Tons of f words), and Brief Nudity.     Special Features: There's an absolutely incredible/awesome special feature on disc 2. It's called Scene Editing Workshop. It's incredible! I'll let you discover it for yourself.         Overall: An awesome movie. An American masterpiece/classic!
B00000K19E|5.0|Cmon its the matrix. We all know its the hands down best action movie ever made.
B000065U1N|4.0|That's right, tons of war violence(which is expected), and LOADS of f words. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, it's just not for the kiddies. Anyway, good flik.     Grade=B
B00006LJ72|1.0|I think Enya's Music is great, but what's the use in constantly releasing the same songs we (Enya's fans) already have on her regular albums (Watermark, Shepherd Moons, etc)?. The only thing NEW about this album would be the tracks May It Be, Silent Night &amp; The Song of the Sandman which are songs not featured in her regular albums; but the rest is more of the same. When will her record company release a colection of Rarities &amp; B-Sides? They insist on releasing collections of songs we, Enya's fans, already have. on A Box of Dreams, Paint the Sky... &amp; this third collection OF THE SAME, the record company never includes on these collections: the radio edit versions of her famous songs (Orinoco Flow, Caribbean Blue, Etc); Book Of Days (Far &amp; Away Version) &amp; her great-hard-to-find B-Sides ('S Fgaim Mo Bhaile, I May Not Awaken, Eclispse, etc). If this collection had included some of these tracks in all the free space that there's left on each CD (which is a lot!), it would have really been a great Enya collection.
B00005NGZX|5.0|This is honestly the best all-around album since...well, i don't even know what.  Converge just breaks all the rules and a few necks and unleashes hell upon every ear that hears this.  Its brutal as f*&amp;%, at the same time strangely melodic, and just a painful joy to listen to.  This is a masterpiece.  nothing in the past 5 years that has come out can compare to this.  This is metal.  This is hardcore.  This is what music is supposed to be all about.  Buy it now.
0066214122|3.0|I have really enjoyed some of Mr. Crichton's books and then there is this one. Admittedly it has suspense and it was a quick read indicating a desire to find what happened next but it does get far-fetched and goes beyond realistic. Also, on one page there was a distorted sentence which really bothers me. What ever happened to proofreading. Mr. Crichton can and has done much better than Prey.
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers was a great read. Even though there is no real main character, the reader can really relate to the soldiers, as a whole, going through what they did in being transformed from civilians to heroes. The struggle that all of the men encountered, from Sobel to the Germans, couldn't help but inspire the reader.<br />The men fighting in this story did so in a period of great uncertainty. The soldiers did not find out what they were obligated to do until just before the order was carried out. THerefore, the fact that they almost always succeeded is very admirable.
B00006G8HX|3.0|Once again, a fine special edition has been released for these venerable Star Trek movies.  In this film, the crew heads off to the newly-formed Genesis planet in the stolen Enterprise.  They meet up with Klingons newly arrived to try and steal the secret of the Genesis Device, which they call the \\"Greatest weapon ever invented.\\"  This film is clearly more light-hearted than TMP or TWOK, the previous two films in the franchise, and introduced the plot device of sending each crewmember off on their own mission before pulling them back together.  As such, we see more of Sulu, Uhura, and Scotty than we are used to, which adds rather than detracts from the story.  Another highlight is the scene-chewing performance of Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon commander, in perfect opposition to William Shatner.<br />Unfortunately, the film tends to be repetative.  It starts off with a flashback to Wrath of Khan to bring the audience up-to-date.  That's fine, but these moments are relived again when Sarek visits Kirk 20 minutes in, and YET AGAIN at the end of the film.  Thus, this 100-minute movie only contains 80 minutes of new material, and repeated watchings tend to leave you fidgiting.  In addition, the sound-stage sets of the Genesis Planet (and Vulcan) are impressive, but not the same as actual location footage.  However, it's a worthy addition to the Star Trek family, it simply suffers in comparison to the two movies on either side of it.<br />Likewise, this special edition is good, but not as good as those for TMP and TWOK.  The highlights are the text commentary by the Okudas, a featurette (25 minutes) on the development of the Klingon language, and the ILM featurette on the effects.  The general making-of feature is interesting (Shatner is amusing in a faux-pompous way), but is mostly a repitition of the audio commentary.  The print is curiously grainy, in contrast to the obviously cleaned-up DVD versions of the previous 2 films.
B000062TU1|4.0|** Please note that this review is modified from the original, to which all the negative feedback is directed. **<br /><br />** Over the past few years I have changed my opinion on this film and the entire film saga. Much of what I stated originally is still true but to me, the film series is entertaining. I wouldn't let a small child watch the later films since it would probably scare the heck out of them, but as your kids grow up, though the films become increasingly darker, I think they can handle it and enjoy them. **<br /><br />My biggest concerns revolve around the blatant way witchcraft is flaunted around. This is not like the tales of Narnia (a superior series of books) or even the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" where magic is part of the story not the predominant aspect. Harry Potter glorifies witchcraft and encourages kids to become involved, going so far as to teach them the basics of Wicca. Wizard of Oz did not \\"teach\\" witchcraft. The Warner Brothers website for Harry Potter has a link for kids to enroll in the school of wizardry.<br /><br />Harry Potter attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns to cast spells, make potions, use divination and the make up of a witches broom. They also talk to the dead and use sorcery routinely. They are introduced to animal/human sacrifice, drinking blood, Mother Goddess theories, reincarnation, divination, demon possession, Celtic and Druid religions and even Satanism.<br /><br />A child reading the books will learn witchcraft as if they were studying Wicca. The only difference in Harry Potter is that the spells are \\"made up\\" words in Latin with a humorous touch, but are not real spells. However, the intrigue leads the child to wanting to learn the same things as Harry, which can lead them to learn correct spells on witchcraft websites linked to Harry Potter. If the interest is there and a child gets excited about learning to be \\"like Harry\\", they will find a way to learn sorcery.<br /><br />This is why those who practice witchcraft and Wicca are so excited about the \\"positive\\" attention that Harry Potter is bringing to them.<br /><br />There is a prevailing shadow of death that hangs over much of the storytelling. This is not a light happy world, but a landscape clouded by gloom and murder. J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, herself admitted in a recent interview that \\"death and bereavement and what death means, I would say, is one of the central themes in all seven books.\\" Yeah, and this is what we want kids to see? I don't think so.<br /><br />These are concerns for me as a parent and it should be a concern for anyone afraid that their child could do more than enjoy this film and books as entertainment.<br /><br />** I probably haven't changed enough of this review to satisfy those who gave it negative feedback but hey, what I wrote is factual. Having said that, anytime I get a chance, I watch the films and enjoy the world that Rowling created. **
B00005JKZT|5.0|Ignore the fringe purists who claim to speak for all longtime fans. At 36, I've read The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion well into the double digits of times. It has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. I absolutely adored Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Two Towers in spite of -- and often because of -- his changes. The changes were, after all, all the only surprises I got. I love the Warg Attack, which gave Aragorn a vulnerability and poignance that his character lacks in the books. Faramir's purity always struck me as inconsistent with the power of the ring on humans, it's great to see him a bit conflicted. The Elves arrival at Helms Deep is a perfect chance to show they didn't abandon mankind. It doesn't make sense to take the time to explain that Galadriel and company took down Sauron's old fortress Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. Of course, only readers will understand most of what I just said. Just be sure to see Fellowship of the Ring before you see this wonderful movie, as there is no attempt to bring you up to date.
B00007KWHG|5.0|The youth of America had a musical divide in the early sixties. While the west coast soft beach harmonies of the Beach Boys were in full swing, the youth of the east coast was stomping to the harder edged harmonies of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. Frankie along with Bob Guadio, Tommy Devito and the late Nick Massi, hailed from Newark New Jersey and went on to become one of the most important vocal groups in history. Between 1962 to 1966, the Seasons charted 23 times, making them the most popular group in that states history[sorry Springsteen fans]. Their influence can be heard every time you hear a 1970's Bee Gees tune or Billy Joel singing \\"Uptown girl\\". Frankie Valli's trademark falsetto voice is as unmistakable as Dylan's whine or Joe Cocker's growl. This collection is a must for anyone who does not own a Four Seasons cd. It contains 16 of the their highest charting hits from 62-68, like \\"Lets Hang On\\", \\"Sherry\\", \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\", \\"C'mon Marianne\\", \\"Opus 17\\" and 'Rag Doll\\" to name a few. Also 1970's Seasons hits like \\"December 1963 Oh What A Night\\" and \\"Who Loves You\\" are here as well. Making this set essential is the inclusion of all of Frankie Valli's top solo hits, like \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\", \\"My Eyes Adored You\\", \\"Swearin To God\\" and \\"Grease\\", making this the only single disc available to include all of his solo hits. This is as perfect as a single hits disc can get and I highly recommend this to anyone young or old, who would like to relive their past or experience a ledendary vocal group for the first time, that was second to none during their hey-day. For a more detailed overview of their career \\"In Season\\" the two disc Anthology is recommended. This review is dedicated to the late Nick Massi, whose bass playing and vocal arrangements will always be in season.
B00005JLEU|5.0|First of all I would like to add my own spite for Disney's handling of this film! If they had put even HALF of the promotion behind Spirited Away  that they did for their own poor quality films such as Lilo and Stich, then they could have made hundreds of millions off of this films! BIG mistake Disney!<br />Anyway, this is one of the greatest films of all times! The characters are full of life and emotions, which is rare to see in an animated film. The artwork is flawless and beautiful and it has the most original story concepts of any movie from the past 50 years. I cannot emphasize how great this movie is. If you are a fan of classic films such as Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz then you will absolutely love this movie. This movie is a classic that will be enjoyed my children and adults. I also recommend checking out Miyzaki's (the directors) earlier works such as Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky!
0064471837|5.0|If you're like me and searching for something to fill the void the end of the 7th Tower series left, this is definatly the right book. ^_^ It is a truly magnificant book.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira sings and writes her heart out and gives so much too her hybrid latin-rock-pop music that its easy to see how well she can be celebrated by those that appreciate her innocent yet disciplined approach to rock and dance music. Shakira puts real energy into her music and stands away from the likes of those she is compared too most often (Paulina Rubio, Thalia) and much rather sounds like &quot;Avril Lavigne&quot; then her same compared latin pop artists for the more &quot;rock&quot; music she writes.<br />Both catchy and danceable songs make up this album and as her previous 2 stuido efforts doesn't lack in diversity as well as ballads and an almost &quot;house&quot; sounding song &quot;ready for the good times&quot; <br />Shakira is a bright and entertaining artist. I look forward to more developed and matured music from her.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I first heard \\"Capricorn\\" on MuchMusic and loved the sound. Jared Leto (the dude with Corn Rows in 'Panic Room') and co. mix a beautiful sound of synthesisers and metal. Then they add the twist of space metaphores (which probably sounds odd, but it's great). Although the term \\"Welcome to the Universe\\" is a bit over used, 30 seconds to mars is my new favorite band and have the best album of 2002 (along with Breaking Benjamin's 'Saturate'). ...
B00005B36H|5.0|Proggresive rock has had many heart stoppingly beautiful artists to thread through the needle of rock history. (King Crimson, Amon duul'2, Rush, Pink Floyd) Those of us who've have loved prog-rock will be especially immersed in this particular album.<br />The structure of each of these songs takes all other bands from focus: this band cannot be compared too. TOOL define what a musicians energy for his capability can accomplish. Too profound to word, the musicians paint the canvas to perfectly accomidate the soothing and immense lyrical vessel that is Maynard Keenan.<br />Drummer Danny Carry sounds as those he has twelve arms and  Justin- bass and Adam -guitar are beyond opinionable comprehension. They move in Zen sequence. Hear the feeling of Samadhi and a band who love thier fans.
1569945233|1.0|once again, (OK it does not happen that often, otherwise we would stop trusting Amazon and shopping with them, would'nt we?) the description is not accurate : this version ISBN 1569945233, monterey media etc.... is an ADAPTATION of Dicken's novel by the St Charles PLayers, who record it with all due talent  and spirit BUT as a play, in an \\"exciting Radio Theater style\\" quote, unquote.....
B00006F7XJ|5.0|All the other reviews found here are true to fact!  It's a great recording worthy of any long time or new fan.  I wish progressive bands like Jethro Tull would listen to this and wise up.  Whilst Camel has put out quality progressive recordings all along, Tull hasn't come out with a decent progressive recording since passion play, but that's another story.  This is a fantastic recording and one and all should give a listen.  You will be glad you did!  The finest progressive rock recording in quite awhile.
B00003CXXM|1.0|All I can say is if you read the book DO NOT watch the movie -- you will not only be disappointed, but possibly mad. If I would have paid money to see this at the movies I would have demanded a refund.<br />The powers that be should be ashamed about this movie and due to their guilt make a new movie BASED on the book.<br />AND<br />Jason is not a blonde hair pretty boy. His big thing is how he can blend into a crowd.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I never read any of the Potter books and really had no intention of.  My friends all told me they were great but I thought they were for children for some odd reason.  So I picked up the movie and was surprised that the movie was well done.  It was entertaining and very interesting.  I thought the effects were great and even though it was up against Lord of the Rings I think it stands on it's own as a good movie.  If you like fantasy and friendly characters definately pick this one up.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|The first time I say this movie, I was pregnant with my 20 year old son.  Now it is a favorite for both of us, I am sure our family will enjoy it for generations to come.
0066214122|5.0|Prey by Michael Crichton is very suspensful and interesting read. Crichton's explaination of nano-technology was fascinating. Discard all negative reviews,it's worth the read.
B00006RIO7|5.0|What a GREAT CD!  And the movie was FABULOUS!  All 3 (Catherine, Renee &amp; Richard) completely surprised me with their amazing voices - who knew they could sing SO WELL!  Very unexpected.  In the movie theatre, people actually cheered at least 3 different times!  Now, that is a rarity.  Once you listen to this CD, you'll be humming the tunes all day (and night) long.  It's quite the soundtrack!
0316666343|1.0|After reading many great reviews about this book I finally broke down and bought it, and it was a waste of my time and money. While the book is not dreadfull, it is certainly not good. I found the writing to be very immature and the story to be unimaginative. Sebold could have done a much better job on this story since it felt rushed and thrown together. The characters could have been developed much better, the best lines in the book are about the father and I wish that Sebold would have spent more time on this and the mother. Many reviews detail the emotion that this book evokes, and I just didn't feel anything remotely close while reading. This story could have been great, but the writing just falls flat. If you really want to read this wait until its on the discount shelf because it is not worth it now.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Good acting, script, editing. Matt Damon looks a bit too short and skinny and too young for being the seasoned Jason Bourne. Pretty tensified and more modernized story by comparing to the old version played by Ridchard Chamberland. In general, not a bad movie and quite watchable.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is definitely my personal favorite movie. It is just above &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; on my list. The entire movie keeps the viewer's attention, as it is backwards. It is very fun to watch (alone or in a group). The acting is incredible, and so is the Academy Award nominated script. The editing was also nominated. I would recommend this movie to just about anybody. The R rating is due to violence and profanity, including a scene with an obscene amount of strong language. I can't say enough about this movie. There is nothing like it. There are no mistakes and it is completely unpredictable. I give it five stars out of five.
051788710X|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to integrate their dream experiences into their whole life experience.<br />Robert Moss offers a wide and quite comprehensive view of the range of dream experiences, along with descriptions of the impact such experiences can have.  He provides numerous tips and examples of daily practice that are extremely useful in working with dream material which by nature is often enigmatic and can be confusing.<br />He does not clutter his approach with psychological jargon, but is nevertheless clearly familiar with the Jungian perspective on dreams; with the benefit of that knowledge in the background.<br />The methods described in Moss' book are superb, especially for those who want to use their dreams for life guidance without utilizing psychological dream work methods, which often can be loaded with psycho-jargon and can be overwhelming at times.  But even those who use psychological methods of dream work will find a richer experience by reading this book.<br />Don't underestimate the value of embarking on this work - dream work can open your life to amazing and wonderful adventures!
B000056K04|1.0|What a disappointment from their previous albums! I saw the 60 Minutes story on Dave Matthews and the show hyped this album as a breakthrough work with their new producer (some know-it-all guy who thought he was improving the band's sound). First off, 60 Minutes was anything but impartial, and they were propping DMB as the greatest thing since the Beatles. And so as a fan and I couldn't wait for this album to come out - and yet from track one I couldn't get into it...I felt as though this band may have been going in the direction of Hootie and the Blowfish if they didn't turn ship soon. I haven't bought one of their albums since...go ahead, prove to me that they're back. Otherwise, they're a come-and-gone sensation like the rest.

B00005JL78|2.0|Ebert listed this as his top film of 2002 and there was even talk that it would be redistributed again for Oscar consideration.  Its obvious, Spielberg has a lot of friends in high places.  This is a poorly written film with a few excellent special effects.  Where as Blade Runner got it right in so many ways, Minority report got it wrong.  How about cultural diversity for one; I hardly doubt that the country will be living so \\"white\\" fifty years from today.  Where there any Hispanics or Asians in this film of the future?  It would have been nice if there was some plot twist and not such a rosy happy Hollywood ending.  How about Tom really being guilty!  Thank God Mr. Cruise didn't take the role in the newly released movie Narc because his doing drugs in Minority Report or anything else is pitiful.  How about a little grit and dirt? How about less fireworks Mr. Lucas, oh I mean, Spielberg.  A.I. and now this, good luck to the viewing masses.
6300214753|5.0|If you were a teen in the eighties,,,,,,This was one of your favorite movies! Along side of Fast Times at Ridgemount High, and Last American Virgin
B00005V9HH|5.0|Kevin Spacey is amazing throughout the entire film. His performance earned him the 1995 Academy Award for best supporting actor (although he had the most lines out of anybody). Although an independent film, word-of-mouth made the movie a box-office success, and is listed as #15 on the top movies of all time list. The R rating is due to some violence, but mostly the extreme profanity, and although the extremety of it occurs mostly in the first 30 minutes, the rest of the movie still carries a substantial amount of strong language. There is no sexuality, though. Fun and thought-provoking, the movie delivers the most incredible and creative ending that I have ever seen. I give it five stars out of five.
B000002J1L|5.0|The \\"Definitive Edition\\" re-mastered versions of the early Genesis albums sound much better than the [yucky]-sounding originals. Especially Nursery Chryme and Foxtrot are much better-sounding. It's like hearing these for the first time. Oh yes, and every Genesis album from Trespass to The Lamb is a 5-star masterpiece. I love lots of their later stuff, but the direction was a little different, so we're really talking about different bands. bye!
0316286443|5.0|This is my favorite of Kevyn Aucoin's three books (The Art of Makeup and Making Faces are his two others).  Face Forward has simple practical suggests as to the application of make-up.  It goes step-by-step, start with the moisturizer, then so on.<br />It shows many different styles and has beautiful models (including Julia Roberts-my favorite).  It is motivating, simple and works.  Has models of every skin and hair tone imaginable.<br />I am an absolute beginner at this - actually his books were the first fashion books I've ever owned.  I've never even read a fashion magazine, either, so I feel confident that any one can find his books helpful.
0783226063|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Every time I watch it I pick up something new. I've seen it on tv several times and I've rented this version many times, and on several occasions I've seen some scenes that are'nt in this DVD version. Such as one scene with the baby worms where they are extracting the water of life, plus a few others. I thought this was supposed to be the &quot;uncut&quot; version? Can some one explain this to me. If there really is this &quot;longer&quot; version out there I would love to own it , thanks.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is very deep and emotional.  I found myself in the boots of those soldier of Easy Company fighting throughout Europe.  I highly recommend this series.  It's one of the best DVD purchases I've ever made.
B00006F2WY|5.0|This was back when rock music was still progressing. The strength of an orchestra working with the power of a rock band. Deep Purple were the first band to integrate rock music with classical. The idea came from Jon Lord, Deep Purple's keyboardist.<BR>The band have the muscle to avoid being buried by orchestration, yet manage to join forces with the orchestra. The outcome is a magnificent union that will delight those who care at all about music. <BR>This set was recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall in London on September 24th, 1969 and was divided into three movements: <BR>1st Movement:  Allegretto. <BR>2nd Movement:  Allegro with lyrics by lead singer Ian Gillan.<BR>3rd Movement:  . Vivace presto which integrates a solo for Ian Paice on drums.<BR>For only having two complete rehearsals, the outcome is absolutely amazing. <br />(Important note) Make sure to get the current release (import only, as of early 2003) which has been completely re-mixed to sound 100% better than the old CD and/or LP, it also includes a nice big booklet full of pictures and if that's not enough for you, a great bonus disc of the band performing a three song set before the Concerto.<br />Track 1: Hush - Perhaps a better version than the one we always hear on the radio, with Ian Gillan's incredible vocal delivery. Sounding almost like early Elvis at times.<BR>Track 2: Wring that Neck - A smoking instrumental with room to play for guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and keyboardist Jon Lord. I must also mention the solid rhythm section of Roger Glover on bass and Ian Paice on drums, they just drive this piece along. Nice.<BR>Track 3: Child In Time - The band were just about to record this \\"soon to be classic\\" for the upcoming album \\"In Rock\\". It might be one of the finest live version they ever did. <BR>It's so new to them that they play it incredibly tight, and Gillan keeps his famous screams slightly off the mic, so not to scare the classical side of the crowd, but it makes for a great reverb sound. Those three tracks give you about half an hour of warm up. The audience sounds like they enjoyed the opening set. Fabulous!<BR>The Concerto for Group and Orchestra was and is an excellent idea from JON LORD, he is a true hero. Thanks Jon.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I think this movie is great. I suggest everyone to buy it.  I assure you that you'll really enjoy watching this movie.  The animation is really good and plot is wonderful.  At first I didn't think it would be all that great but I gave it a try.  You should do the same and you'll see how great it is.
B000002J2B|4.0|So why DID Steve Hackett leave Genesis? Because they didn't give him enough input in the songwriting, and he wanted the band to move more into the progressive direction, while the rest of the band wanted to become more accessible. Listen to &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot; (Hackett's first and most progressive solo effort) and listen to his tunes on W&amp;W and you'll hear his influence clearly. They are very different from the rest of the tunes, which are very much Tony/Phil/Mike. To understand, it must be noted that almost all Genesis music was written by Tony, Phil and Mike in jam sessions. They would take these ideas and arrange them into songs. Steve Hackett would then add his parts. Last, the entire completed music would be left for Gabriel to write his words and melodies to. Banks said that he got chills when in the studio he heard Gabriel singing the &quot;666&quot; part on Supper's Ready for the first time. The reason Gabriel left is because he was asked to, the rest of Genesis feeling that they were not getting enough credit for the music. The Lamb shows this in the Gabriel-penned tune Counting out Time, arguably the most catchy and commercially viable Gabriel/Genesis tune, and very reminiscent of what would appear in Gabriel's first solo album. Up to this point, writing credits on their albums always said &quot;All tunes by all&quot;, or &quot;Written by Genesis&quot;. Gabriel was given credit for this tune on the album, also Brian Eno (!) makes an appearance on the Gabriel-Eno collaboration &quot;Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging&quot;. Anyhow, after PG left, Phil reluctantly took over the vocals (he sang lead on Nursery Chrymes' &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; and Selling England &quot;More Fool Me&quot;, and you can REALLY hear him on their 70's concert album &quot;Genesis Live&quot;) and everyone was floored by the similarity to Gabriel, which meant they could continue to tour (the only drummer good enough to replace Collins while he sang was Bill Bruford - no slight to Chester Thomson) and also their audience wouldn't abandon them. Apparently the person most surprised at Collin's singing ability was Collins himself - no one can deny he became one of the greatest and most popular singers ever. It's known that much of the trademark edge on his voice showed up after his nasty divorce, during the &quot;I Don't Care Anymore&quot; phase. Genesis continued to make two great albums, Trick of the Tail and W&amp;W, and for the first time we get individual writing credits. But the progressive sound was a little mellower, which suited Collins still-softer style. TofthT had some seriously mellow tunes, along with the incredible tour de force &quot;Dance On A Volcano&quot; and the underture &quot;Los Endos&quot;. W&amp;W was similar but the difference between this material and the first post-Hackett album Then There Were Three is obvious. On TTW3 you hear the core trio of Phil Tony and Mike. Hackett's influence and sound is gone, so TTW3 is mostly very mellow, nicely produced and thick with keyboards and 12-string guitars and Phil's so soft voice. But it did yield their first smash hit, Follow You Follow Me. If you liked Hackett's influence, then listen to his first 3 solos, Voyage of the Acolyte, Please Don't Touch, and Spectral Mornings, all excellent and very progressive records, especially Acolyte (features members of Genesis). W&amp;W is a little uneven due to the tension between Hackett and the rest, and therefore is not their best but has some of their best post-Gabriel moments. By the way, Phil Collins is one of the best drummers in the world, and if you want to know why, listen to an album by Brand X, called &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot;, from 1975. The facts herein are drawn from interviews compiled in a book that was published around the time of Then There Were Three. There was a picture showing Collins, Rutherford and Banks walking together on the street deep in animated conversation, with Hackett skulking along about 20 feet behind with his wife. The caption, written by Banks, was &quot;A picture says a thousand words&quot;. Finally, not much is said about the appearance of Hackett on Genesis &quot;Match of The Day&quot;, a 3-song EP by post-Gabriel Genesis with Hackett credited on one song. The EP is pretty good, mellow again, but with some very catchy melodies. To complete your collection of &quot;progressive rock&quot; version of Genesis, get Wind and Wuthering.
0316286850|4.0|This book is my second favorite of Kevyn Aucoin's three books (The Art of Makeup and Face Forward are his two others).  Making faces shows the different types of effects that can be created through the application of make-up.  It has practical models as well as those perhaps more suitable for theatrical make-up artists (Madame Butterfly, etc.)  I feel the book impresses upon one the power of make-up.<br />I am an absolute beginner at this - actually his books were the first fashion books I've ever owned.  I've never even read a fashion magazine, either, so I feel confident that any one can find his books helpful.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore is stunning.  Absolutely stunning.  I've heard that before he did the score for LOTR he did films like The Silence of the Lambs, Big, and That Thing You Do!, but for a pretty much no-name composer, he's astounding.  Every time I listen to a track I can easily visualize any scene it's depicting.  Every time the theme for the ringwraiths is played I get chills running down my back.  Every time I listen to track #2 \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" I want to laugh at Gandalf being called a \\"Disturber of the Peace\\".  And every time track #17 \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" is played, I want to cry.<br />This soundtrack does what every perfect soundtrack should do: play as background music so fitting that subconsciously the music enters our minds and influences our opinions of the scene, and compliments it beautifully.  But on its own it's even better......hard not to believe that the first time I saw the movie I never noticed the score.<br />Some of my favorite tracks:<br />#2 Concerning Hobbits  It's a beautiful, sweet track with panflute-like instruments.<br />#8 Flight to the Ford  The beginning (complimenting when ~Arwen~ comes to Frodo) sounds angelic, ethereal, and just plain lovely.  But then the ringwraiths come.  I can't describe the theme (aaaah) but it gives me the creeps and I've heard that the words being sung are in Mordor tongue.<br />#9 Many Meetings  All I can say is that it captures the beauty of Rivendell.  Anyone who knows the elven-city can believe how mystical and enchanting the song is.<br />#10 The Council of Elrond  The beginning with Aniron--Theme for Aragorn and Arwen, sung by Enya is just so Elvish and Arwenish that it goes beyond belief (ok, ok I liked Evenstar on the TTT soundtrack better but Aniron's great too) and the lyrics are great (Tiro! En eria e mor/I lir en el luitha uren/Ai! Aniron Undomiel [that means Look!  A star rises out of the darkness/the song of the star enchants my heart/ah I desire Evenstar]).  The rest of it, leading up to a heroic theme and a finishing cymbal clash, symbolizes the start of the Fellowship of the Ring.  Now on from here I love all of the tracks, but my favorite favorites....<br />#13 The Bridge of Khazad-dum  I LOVE THIS TRACK!  It's the gentle hobbit/heroic fellowship theme combined into a HUGE CLASHING absolutely inspiring dwarvish track.  The end is very sad though, because it's a solo boy's voice with a soft boys' choir in the background.  It goes along with Gandalf's *death* almost too well...it saddens me deeply *sniffs*.<br />#17 The Breaking of the Fellowship  Well....I almost cry sometimes when I listen to this.  It starts with a single violin note.....which joins into a tragicly moving piece....which goes into an even sadder part where Sam almost drowns and Frodo pulls him up.  Then the fellowship theme is changed again, this time upbeat with drums tapping in the background, as Aragorn Legolas and Gimli run off to rescue Merry and Pippin.  And then it goes into the vocal song \\"In Dreams\\".  I love this song.  Edward Ross (the guy who sang it) has a great voice!  I love the lyrics so much I'll type them here:<br />When the cold of winter comes<br />Starless night will cover day<br />In the veiling of the sun<br />We will walk in bitter rain<br />But in dreams<br />I can hear your name<br />And in dreams<br />We will meet again<br />When the seas and mountains fall<br />And we come to end of days<br />In the dark I hear a call<br />Calling me there<br />I will go there<br />And back again<br />As I said, I love that song.<br />#18 May It Be  Enchanting.  Mythical.  I love Enya's voice.  The lyrics don't make a whole lot of sense (following the pattern of most Enya songs) but one line \\"May it be an evening star shines down upon you\\" corresponds very well with Galadriel's line \\"May it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out\\".  Also the line \\"May it be when darkness falls your heart will be true\\" is a pointed message to Boromir lol.  Butthis is a great song.<br />So go buy this!  The greatest CD in the world....<br />:)romir lol.  But this is a great song.<br />So go buy this!  The greatest CD in the world....<br />:)
B00005JKZT|5.0|Ive always heard about Lord of the Rings even before i actually tried to read the books. When i read articles and stories about it i thought: Man, this Tolkien guy was a genious! A creating God in his own media. How could he created such a astonishingly complex universe with its own history, peoples, languages and cities? After watching Fellowship and the Two towers four times each i realized that i am in love with epic movies, particulally those whose story is passed in an past or fantastic time. Braveheart, Kagemusha, Ran, Conam or even Star Wars, are movies that give us a feel of watching something greater than us, something trully magnificent. Theyre like the songs the bards sang in the royal courts of Europe in the Middle Ages.<BR>As for Lord of the Rings, The Two towers abandons the pastoral tone of Fellowship and jumps head-on in the epic dimension. Now the War of the Ring has finally begun as the titanic clash between men and uruk-hai in Helms Deep and the attack by the ents on Isengard make clear. Now the moments of thruth have finally come and the Midlle-Earth will be shaken to its very foundations. When Two Towers ends we, poor mortals that never read the books can only wonder what will happen in Return of the King, knowing only that will be even bigger than what is shown in The two towers. Since people who will be reading this review will very probably know the movies story by hard i prefer to focus on two very diferent yet very similar characters: King Thoden and Smagol/Gollum. Thoden is a man, king of Rohan and a brave and noble warrior, and Gollum is a repulsive scavenging creature that has been twisted and deformed by the Ring of Power for centuries. But what links these two characters you ask? Their humanity. Gollum was once a hobbit like Frodo or Sam but has been transformed by the ring into a near-animal. Finding Frodo and Sam and joining them as a guide in their journey to Mordor awakens something in him that laid dorment and forgotten for too long. The faith Frodo has that he can be different, that he can redeem himself is what makes Smagol loyal to the goals of the Quest. His struggle with himself, with Gollum, that is nothing but the savagery and survival instict wich dominated him for so long, makes Smagol both a tragic and touching character. King Thoden on the other hand is a man on an existencial crisis. After being spelled by Saruman and manipulated by Grma Thoden awokes from his apathy and lethargy to find his beloved land being devastated. The death of his only son and heir and the grief that follows  it  contributes for his sense of displacement and confusion. He tries to do his best but still dont know who is or what he must do. And then, when all seems lost and hopeless he finally discovers that he must fight to protect his people from the horrors of genocide, and side by side with Aragorn, Legolas and his lieutenants he rides out to battle once more to meets its destiny. So heres my review and please watch the movie first and then read it. I hope you will think as i do
0451167716|5.0|As for my opinion of the book, as clich as this may sound, The Godfather is honestly the best book I have ever read. Not only does it satisfy the human desire to be good at being bad, but it shows a touching side of corruption. It does not indulge in malice or anything of the related kind, nor does it condemn morals. In fact, the Godfather himself was one to be easily angered by people close to him being promiscuous. Aside from that, he never wronged anyone who did not deserve to be wronged in the first place, or did not go about his duties for the wealth of himself. The novel is also a representation of a perfect mafia, a government of its own. Personally, I would never think of being brave enough to be in a mafia, but if this one existed, I would be fighting to even wash this Don's dishes. It is a story where you have the mindset going into reading it that the Godfather will play the part of the \\"bad guy\\", but you come out with a sense of triumph that he ended up succeeding as much as possible. Even from the beginning passages, it is quite evident that the Godfather is a man of respect and a man desperately needed in desperate times, one who is called on when the absolute worst is feared, for anyone at all, and he never fails to fix a problem for those people. For that, I consider him to be a figure more like a \\"good guy\\" than bad. All of his ideas are genius, and he winds the story for you in a very unexpected manner. All of Mario Puzo's characters are unforgettable, the story notwithstanding its intensity and magnificence if any of them were missing, and his plot enjoyably complicated.
B000002J2D|3.0|Mellow. Laid back. Tons of keyboards and 12-string guitars. Lush production, lots of reverb. Did I say mellow? Good album but mellow, this is a very different-sounding Genesis, I could even compare it a little to the Banks solo album &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot;. Hackett's gone and it's obvious. Genesis were always kind of a trio, Banks Collins and Rutherford writing most of the material, with Steve Hackett adding guitar later and Peter Gabriel adding his parts last (see my review of Wind and Wuthering for the history of Genesis and Hackett). TTW3 is like their &quot;solo&quot; album. They got lucky though, &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; was their first smash hit. Their next album Duke, would be similar with some notable exceptions, &quot;Turn it On Again&quot; the most obvious. After those hits and Collins solo career taking off, Genesis knew which direction they should go. It was a smart choice and they never looked back. Progressive was all but dead and they had made their indelible mark. TTW3 was an anxious time for Genesis fans, with Gabriel and Hackett gone, they wondered about the future of their beloved progressive art-band. TTW3 was considered below standard by most fans, but Genesis eventually made as big a mark on the 80's as they did on the 70's. They are truly one of the great survivors and one of the most influential bands of all time. This album is somewhat of a low point, but if you like Collins mellow voice, thick harmonies and layered arrangements, then check it out. There are no solos at all on this album, no progressive anthems. A few nice melodies and turns of phrase, but the longer tunes are still very even in terms of the writing and production, meaning no contrasting sections like earlier material. Mellow and even, no big highs or lows. Lush and mellow. Sleepy, I'm getting sleepy...Follow You Follow Me is I think the best tune on the album, and as the album closer it is indeed the shape of things to come.
0316286443|5.0|This is my favorite of Kevyn Aucoin's three books (The Art of Makeup and Making Faces are his two others).  Face Forward has simple practical suggests as to the application of make-up.  It goes step-by-step, start with the moisturizer, then so on.<br />It shows many different styles and has beautiful models (including Julia Roberts-my favorite).  It is motivating, simple and works.  Has models of every skin and hair tone imaginable.<br />I am an absolute beginner at this - actually his books were the first fashion books I've ever owned.  I've never even read a fashion magazine, either, so I feel confident that any one can find his books helpful.
B000002LK1|5.0|I ask myself, &quot;How could anyone NOT like Depeche Mode???&quot; every time I hear this album. It is definitely one of the best CD's I own. The album provides a mix of calm and surreal toons, and feel-good dance songs. &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; combines a catchy western guitar riff with techo beats, creating the perfect club hit. My personal favourite, &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; contains orgasmic, relaxing vocals yet upbeat synthpop. &quot;Halo&quot; has more deep domestic lyrics yet blends in synth and dance. &quot;Clean&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; are more peaceful and serene, perfect for listening to while falling asleep. Every single track is amazing and different in it's own way, yet definitely maintains Depeche Mode's unique trademark sound. I recommend this to any hardcore DM fan or anyone checking DM out for their first time.
B000002H5I|5.0|When I was a little girl (that wasn't all that long ago, as I'm only in high school now) my mom and dad played this tape endlessly.  I loved it, and I still do.  Actually, I at first bought this album for nostalgic reasons.  When I listened to it, I realized why my parents had played it until the tape broke (literally)!  Tracy Chapman is one of the most amazing musicians I have ever heard.  This is my favorite release of hers.  Her heartfelt lyrics, which often express her political views, would be enough for me, even if her voice and musicianship were terrible.  They're not.  Tracy has a rich, soulful voice, and the music is fabulous.  To sum it up, Tracy Chapman is an extraordinary singer and songwriter, and you should buy this album!
6302891272|3.0|This movie really did surprised me. <BR>I have watched 3 other 'Macbeth' <BR>but this seemed incredible that is <BR>was produced in all Japanese style. <BR>Akira Kurosawa, who was the one of <BR>famous producer, have made this movie <BR>in many different ways which made us <BR>interested in. Toshiro Mifune, the <BR>Japanese Macbeth gives one of this <BR>finest performance who is destroyed<BR>by his wife's murderous greed and his <BR>own allconsuming desire of poower. <BR>From his first bloody battle- climax, <BR>he turnes really greedy and mean. <BR>Kurosawa's brilliant stage, the <BR>Japanese setting and historic period <BR>seem entirely appropriate. This new <BR>style really made me enjoy but the <BR>part that I didnt like was that it was <BR>in black and white. If it was in color, <BR>i would of enjoyed it more. But Im still <BR>impressed in Akira Kurosawa, what he <BR>have turned this movie to and the whole <BR>idea of making this into Japanese style.
B000007VRQ|2.0|Well they look like kids on the cover of the cassette of this I own. The music sounded at different times like Syd Barrett-Floyd, Davey Jones (Bowies first act), Simon and Garfunkel and the Association. The writing is rudimentary, most tunes have no drums, just acoustic guitars being strummed and some poorly-recorded upright piano with strings and horns sprinkled here and there. One thing is obvious though, Peter Gabriel can sing. Though he likely had not realized even a small percent of his ability, he is the main feature of this collection. The lyrics are typical teen-philosophy, unlike the mythical story-teller he later became. Banks also gives a few moments on mainly a bad-sounding piano. I listened for clues to their later writing and found a few tunes had contrasting sections that made them interesting. The song &quot;Window&quot; has definite similarities to parts of Trespass, and notably features backup vocals very much the same as &quot;Dusk&quot; and &quot;Visions of Angels&quot; (sung by Banks and Rutherford). The version I have is mixed so that the tunes all run together, which creates a pleasant effect. The production values are low, and if you've been listening to Genesis since the early 70's like me and haven't heard this, then it's time you did. Otherwise I don't think you will get much out of it. Again, the main feature is Gabriel's teenage voice sounding very recognizeable, and is the main delight in listening to these otherwise rudimentary recordings. The other feature is being totally amazed at the difference between this material and what became their first real album, the great album Trespass.
B00005ATQI|5.0|This is the most terrifying movie ever made.  Amazingly shot, completely atmospheric, and tremendously acted.  Jack Nicholson is superb.  The last twenty minutes alone are well the worth the price of admission.  But there's another two hours to the movie, and thankfully, they are equally as enjoyable.
6302891272|5.0|I am a student at Nagoya International School.  Japanese is my first language, but I have studied English in my International School.  And I was fortunate to see \\"Throne of Blood\\" in my English literature class.  After viewing the movie, I found Kurosawa's Japanese version of Shakespeare's Macbeth was a spectacular masterpiece.  \\"Throne of Blood\\" altered the setting of the story, but still kept the atmosphere of the original Macbeth, which was set in Scotland.  I was afraid that the Japanese language in the movie would spoil the rich Shakespearian language included in the film.  But Kurosawa kept the theme of Macbeth alive in the film by modifying couple of characters and plots of the story.  For example, because witches aren't familiar to the Japanese in the 16th century, they replaced the witch by an evil spirit, Mononoke.  Also, Kurosawa excluded characters like Macduff.  So in the movie, the Mononoke didn't give the prophecy of \\"Beware of Macduff\\" and \\"Be afraid of no women born\\".  Other than that, virtually all of the plot and characters were the same as the original version of Macbeth.  This exhibits the fact that Kurosawa has successfully managed to keep the mood and the theme of Macbeth alive in the film.
0790749815|4.0|Perhaps Hitchcock's most acclaimed work, \\"North by Northwest\\" is an entertaining adventure of espionage, mistaken identity, and a typical 50's romance.  Cary Grant plays the unpresuming Roger Thornhill, and advertising executive who inadvertently gets sucked into a ring of spies who believe he is a man named George Kaplan.<br />Not knowing who Kaplan is, Thornhill tries to escape the spies and find out the truth.  In doing so, he is framed for murder, and his flight across the country begins!  On his way, he meets the mysterious Eve Kendall (played exquisitely by Eva Marie Saint), a glamorous blond who tries to set Thornhill up and then falls for him.<br />The entire story is one big chase, leading to the infamous \\"face-off\\" on scenic Mount Rushmore.  The story by Lehmann and the direction by Hitchcock make this movie a true masterpiece.  The DVD features an interesting commentary, theatrical trailer, and featurette about the making of \\"North by Northwest\\" hosted by Eva Marie Saint herself.  <br />If you see no other Hitchcock movie, see this one!  They truly don't make ones like this anymore.
B00000K3G8|4.0|I saw this movie in Harvard Square when it first came out and couldn't stop moving (and neither could the crowd)!  The CD that followed was anti-climactic.  This one gets closer, but still misses the joy of the movie.  Buy the DVD and play just the audio if you want to listen to the whole thing.  Thank goodness the DVD finally came out!  If anything, this album shows how much the Talking Heads are more than David Byrne.  The four are fine in their individual endevours, but are truly alive when together.<br />Please, please, please release &quot;The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads&quot; on CD?  Pretty please?
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I didn't buy this at first because I have almost all of the songs on other recordings. But for Christmas, I decided to buy it for my father, and before I gave it to him, I copied it to cassette so he could listen to it in his car as well as in his home. While it was on, I realized I had to have it.<br />I'm not a diehard Fleetwood Mac fan, but I love their music and will continue to purchase new materials as it comes out. I have all the &quot;Rumors-Era&quot; cds and their live stuff, but I don't collect versions of the songs or anything like that. Even though I have almost every song on this set, it was great to hear it all together. I loved the song choices and the way in which the two cds were organized. The songs are very familiar to me, but the albums seemed really fresh. I got my own version of the CD and have been listening to the set for weeks.<br />I can't comment much on the versions of the song, the quality of the recordings, or the remastering, but if you are a fan, and you need a little something to hold you over until Mac' (much awaited!) new CD, this is great. It sounds excellent in my stereo, in the car, and on the computer. I'm so glad I got it!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I don't have much time...but let me tell you...this film is AMAZING.  I thought it was going to be some teeny-bopper horror film by looking at the poster...so I passed it up in the theatre.  Huge mistake.  My friend popped it into the dvd player last month out of the blue and said, &quot;Are you ready to have your mind blown away?&quot;  I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />Boy, was my mind blown away.<br />I'm not going to tell you a thing.  Surprise yourself with this philosophical poem of a movie.  It is a beautiful, moving, exciting, thrilling, pychadelic experience.  Best viewed with 5.1 channel surround sound in the dark with the volume turned WAY UP...<br />This movie changes minds...and perspectives...and lives...way more thought-provocing than the matrix...(and the music, the cinematography, and the editing is unparralled).  I bought the soundtrack as well.<br />Anyway, enjoy the ride...and remember...play it with lots of volume for the full effect!<br />PS...I already bought 7 of these dvd's...and gave them all to my best friends.  I've never bought so many of the same movie before...if that's any indication of my feelings for this phenomenal film.
B0000028VT|4.0|This is a very good album.  Mariah at her best.
0517220784|4.0|Sherlock Holmes, the great consulting detective, hardly needs an introduction, nor do his stories need a synopsis. This hardcover edition of &quot;The Complete Sherlock Holmes&quot; contains all the original Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels published by Conan Doyle.<br />As such, this book is the perfect compilation of a timeless classic, for both those re-reading these wonderful stories or those discovering them for the first time. In addition to this, I loved the cover art of this particular edition - it gives just the right impression and captures the ambience of the tales.<br />The only negative comment I had (hence the 4 star rating) was with the actual presentation of the book. Unfortunately, the publishers have attempted to cram all the stories into a 480-page book. This has resulted in an oversized hardcover, with rather small font, and worst of all, newspaper-style columns on each page. Perhaps the intention was to emulate the original format of the stories as they appeared in The Strand in the late 1800s. Regardless, the book format is therefore slightly unwieldy because of its size and is a little hard to read.<br />Despite this shortcoming, I'd recommend this classic collection to anyone and this edition is definitely worth the price.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is an interesting take on what could be a very depressing and sad story. The story is told from the point of view of a murder and rape victim as she looks down on her friends and family from heaven. It was touching to hear her words as she watches her friends grow older and experience things that she never had the opportunity to do. Towards the end of the book, it was nice to see the main character get the chance to come back to earth through the body of a former classmate. Even though her time back here on earth was short, she was able to live life again, which is something she had coveted ever since it was so violently taken. I also loved the way that she was vindicated through the death of her murderer. In some ways, after becoming so engrossed in the characters, I felt vindicated by his getting what he deserved.<br />This is an excellent read and makes you truly grateful for your life and all that you have here on earth because it can be taken away so suddenly and easily. I highly recommend this book!
B00003CX5P|4.0|If you're like me and thousands of others you bought the VHS tape and now the DVD like a good little Star Wars geek and like me you were not happy with how long this widescreen release was in coming, but you were satisfied when it finally arrived. The really good thing about this DVD is that it brought a new appreciation for what a massive project this movie really was. I still love Star Wars, but why is Lucas trying so hard to ruin what's been built?<BR>Jar Jar remains ever annoying and the plot has some holes, but at least on the DVD suffering can be at a minimum with the skip feature. Let's be honest what we really want with this movie is a way to relive what we all love in the original Star Wars trilogy.<BR>It is evident to me that after seeing this movie and Episode II that Lucas CAN NOT direct or motivate actors to save his life. Empire and Jedi were pulled off so beautifully because others directed them. If you look to the first of the series (A New Hope of which most of you simply call Star Wars) the same directing flops are present and bad acting reigns supreme. Maybe in years to come when these movies are remade we will have a director step up who can actually direct, but until then we'll have to deal with this blundering yet beloved fool called Lucas.
B000002NBY|5.0|I love this album. I always have. When I was a very small child, this was my favorite album (I bet my parents really thought that came out of left field.) It's rhythmic, several songs are in sharply different styles, it's catchy, and beautiful. If it's a concern for some parents out there, it's pretty much entirely child-appropriate, but interesting and engaging for adults as well. It might provide a doorway to an appreciation of world music. And you can dance to it, too. I love this album.
B00005JLSC|3.0|A lot of good ingredients have gone into the making of this long-delayed movie version of the hit Broadway musical \\"Chicago,\\" but the film, as a whole, fails to overcome some of the basic weaknesses inherent in the source material.  Like virtually all musicals of recent vintage (just about anything post-\\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" and \\"Grease,\\" I would say), \\"Chicago\\" adheres to the proposition that audiences will no longer accept the conceit of live action characters suddenly bursting into song in the middle of straightforward prose passages (audiences, for some reason, seem to have less of a problem when animated figures do this).  As a result, all the musical numbers in this piece - and there are many - occur in the form of stage acts that parallel the major events of the narrative.  One has to admire the way in which screenwriter Bill Condon, working off the Fred Ebb/Bob Fosse original, is able to knit together these two disparate realms of action into a unified, seamless whole - thanks, in no small measure, to the cleverness and adroitness of director Rob Marshall and editor Martin Walsh, who have clearly thrown all their skill, talent and energy (and then some) into this particular project.<br />The problem is that the material itself is not really all that compelling.  The plot, sort of a cross between Chandleresque pulp fiction and Fosse's own \\"Cabaret,\\" serves as little more than an excuse to hang the musical numbers on.  The story involves two women - one an established vaudevillian and the other a wannabe star looking for her first big break - who find themselves behind bars for the murder of two men.  Roxie Hart is the film's centerpiece, a mediocre talent who hopes to use the scandal her crime has created as her ticket to fame and fortune on the stage.  But Roxie soon learns that fame in 1920's Chicago can be fleeting, and that the melodrama-craving public that couldn't get enough of you last week can drop you like old news this week the moment a juicier scandal comes along.  The script has some fun parodying this aspect of tabloid obsession and madness, but the film feels so much like a live-action cartoon at times that any hope of our becoming involved in any of the characters' predicaments and fates is virtually eliminated.  \\"Chicago\\" is \\"clever,\\" it's true, almost too clever for its own good, and, with its characters ultimtately reduced to caricatures, it begins, finally, to reek of artifice.  One wishes that the film were not so all-fired determined to distance us from the action, not so afraid of appearing \\"old fashioned\\" and \\"square\\" by actually allowing us to care about the characters.  In fact, the most intriguing part of the film is the court scene near the end, when the drama is allowed to play itself out a bit without recourse to all the highfalutin, show stopping numbers.  It may seem like blasphemy to wish that a musical would curtail its song-and-dance moments a bit and provide a few more scenes of straight drama, but certainly plenty of great musicals have done just that in the past (then again, they actually had books worth constructing a musical around).<br />Technically, the film is very impressive.  The musical numbers have been mounted with a great deal of imagination, energy and technical expertise, although the editing occasionally intrudes into and thereby diminishes some of Fosse's brilliantly worked-out dance routines.  Still, taken separately, each number stands as a mini story on its own, and the cutting does keep the energy level high in purely cinematic terms.  The songs by Kander and Ebb, though not particularly melodic or catchy, do serve the material well, being both lyrically clever and relentlessly high-spirited.<br />Of the performers, Renee Zellweger steals the show as Roxie, conveying both the befuddled vulnerability and ruthless drive that define the character.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking for all the world like Natalie Wood in \\"Gypsy,\\" exudes a real slinky sexiness as Velma Kelly, the stop-at-nothing rival who has to defend her throne against this slyly manipulative up-and-coming sensation.

I just happen to feel that a truly great musical has to offer more than just spectacular song-and-dance numbers.  It has to provide heart, as well, and a story to make us care.  Just because people sing and dance in musicals doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to see them as real people with real emotions, conflicts and problems.  \\"Chicago\\" gets the musical parts right for the most part.

B00006CXXU|4.0|It's unfortunate that Christina Aguilera vamped up her image (a really nice way of putting it) the way she did and released \\"Dirrty\\" as her first single. Because of these two things, the rest of the album \\"Stripped\\" is overlooked. I was impressed with this album. At first, I expected the same bubblegum pop music that was on her first album. I knew that she has \\"grown up\\", but I still just expected the same old music with and \\"older\\" feel to it (i.e. Britney Spears), but that wasn't the case with \\"Stripped.\\" Many of the songs on this album are very good and, as usual, Christina blows everyone away with her powerful voice.
6305750750|3.0|If you're like me and thousands of others you bought this tape like a good little Star Wars geek and like me you were not happy with how long this widescreen release was in coming, but you were satisfied when it finally arrived. My advice to anyone looking to purchase this VHS tape is to wait until you have a DVD player and purchase the DVD.<BR>There are a ton more features to this relatively mediocre movie title. The (...) extra film cell hardly makes up for that. Also, Jar Jar is still annoying and the plot has some holes, but at least on the DVD suffering can be at a minimum with the skip feature. But let's be honest what we really want with this movie is a way to relive what we all really love in the original Star Wars trilogy. It is evident to me that after seeing this movie and Episode II that Lucas CAN NOT direct or motivate actors to save his life. Empire and Jedi were pulled off so beautifully because others directed them. If you look to the first of the series (A New Hope of which most of you simply call Star Wars) the same directing flops are present and bad acting reigns supreme. Maybe in years to come when these movies are remade we will have a director step up who can actually direct, but until then we'll have to deal with this blundering yet beloved fool called Lucas.
B00005JLCE|5.0|I am waiting with baited breath until the DVD version is released.  This has been one of my favorite movies for over 10 years.  Now I'll admit that this wasn't the \\"best\\" movie ever made and lacks just about everything that the movie critics are looking for, BUT - the movie is hilarious, has great comedy writers, great music and makes you feel good!  I think that's how people ultimately judge movies, how it makes you feel!<br />So it may not have been nominated for a Golden Globe or Oscar, but if you LOVE Madonna and enjoy a simple comedy, you can't beat Who's That Girl!
0380729407|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books.  Read it when I was in fifth grade and I wish I would've picked it back up since then.  This is a MUST-HAVE book.  Heavy themes woven throughout, it's a book which I witnessed my 'too cool to read' friend at the time convert into a voraciously avid sci-fi junkie.
6302891272|5.0|I am a Japanese girl who is a student at Nagoya International School in Japan.  We watched several \\"Macbeth\\" films during class, but I thought the \\"Throne of the Blood\\" was the most provoking versions of \\"Macbeth.\\"  It was very interesting watching the movie using old, feudal languages of Japan.  <br />What I liked most about this movie was that it was the spookiest version of \\"Macbeth\\" I had ever watched.  While the other version of \\"Macbeths\\" contained blood, loudness, and dramatic scenes, most of this movie was quite slow paced and without blood.  However, it definitely made me chilled- the ancient witch singing alone with an omen-like voice matched greatly with the haunted forest.  This movie did not need any blood or guts to make it unforgettable; instead, its uncomfortable calmness gets us chilled to the bones.  <br />Although this version only included one of the witch's prophecies, \\"never loosing a single battle unless the Cobweb Forest moves towards the castle,\\" it was enough to have Macbeth terrified and get sort of \\"insane.\\"  Then, the most powerful scene came, the scene of Macbeth's death.  I simply could not take my eyes off the screen when hundreds of arrows came flying toward Macbeth.  It was very shocking, when suddenly an arrow pierced through Macbeth's neck.  His wide opened eyes and his deadly voice was a scene that didn't leave my mind for a while.  Although I was aware that his death was an inevitable fate, it was quite a contrary to my expectation of \\"Macbeth being slew by the 'hero'.\\"<br />Overall, this movie was fantastic and I can recommend this to any Shakespeare or Kurosawa fan.  It is incredible.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is quite simply a beautiful album.  Comments below suggest keeping it away from people with emotional problems. While sitting through this CD, one can not help but feel happy...and sad at the same time.  Their are quite an array of emotions.  It is a rollercoaster of sound if you are open to new and exciting things.  Sigur Ros are simply one of the best bands around.  I suggest checking them out live if you have the chance.
6302891272|4.0|In the English class I take, I read the original Macbeth which was written by Shakespeare.  We watched several different versions of the play in this class.  One of them was this version &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;.  Before watching this, I wondered how the director was going to express the rich Shakespearean language which is the main thing that makes his plays so fascinating in a totally different language, Japanese.  As I watched this video, I felt that the director was very successful in expressing the themes and motifs that were used in the original version.  The director had changed a lot of the sceneries and the plots, but the story seemed to flow very well and I believe that these changes were the keys to success in expressing and keeping the rich Shakespearean language.  <BR>I would strongly recommend this movie to people that have read the original Macbeth.   It is very worthwhile to take time to watch this version.  It may be even better if you are able to understand Japanese.

B00006J3WH|4.0|I think the fact that this CD has been favourably reviewed in the mainstream press says it all.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|Likened by many critics to the boybands that have constantly cluttered our airwaves for what seems like centuries, these dual Russian pop sensations seemed to have been met with mixed reviews and harmed in some ways by their sexuality ploy to push their way in the door. Not immune to this, I have to say that I, too, was a little distraught to hear that someone else was defaming the already unsalvageable realm dubbed the music industry with yet another marketing ploy. Yes, when I first heard of t.A.T.u. and the ploy used to sell their albums, I found myself invariably skeptical of what content their album could hold. Still, I opted to listen to their Russian release first, and I noticed something that the press seemed to have left out; that the rudimentary elements of a band that seemed like they could be entertaining actually existed within that premanufacture publicity ploy. Accordingly, I went out to purchase 200 Km/H in the wrong Lane and have been entertained by it ever since.<br />Although the sound is definitely crafted from the mainstream intersections that pop feeds from, the album still had a few gems hidden inside it that I actually found myself enjoying. From the frantic beats and hasty lyrics of \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" I found something to entertain my temponic cravings, then I found myself and my lack of radio station ingestation paying off as the ballad-with-a-beat \\"All The Things She Said\\" kicked in, and the album went from there. Personally I found Clowns one of the more meritable tracks listed, because their \\"floating forests in the air\\" analogies in the lyrics seem beautiful for some reason.<br />This isn't to say that everything about the album is perfect, mind you, nor is this review saying that I agree with the way the tracks were arranged. There are a few portions here and there that reflect opposing polarities on the listening spectrum, taking a person to heights only to throw them abruptly to the sorrowful ground, and this annoyed me a bit. Still, the rest of the album more than made up for it.<br />If you haven't heard the album or its tracks yet, simply listen to a sample provided and determine if you like that or not. If you do and you agree with those voices, then you'll find yourself in agreeance that this is, perhaps, and overlooked work because its marketing ploy overshadows the quality of the two singers involved.the rest of the album more than made up for it.<br />If you haven't heard the album or its tracks yet, simply listen to a sample provided and determine if you like that or not.

B000000993|3.0|If you are new to Tool, this is a good place to start.<br />Tool's music is often about deep underlaying themes not appreciated by the casual listener; hence, 'Undertow' wins the versatility award among Tool albums, being (sorry for the term) \\"radio-friendly\\" enough for most people, yet deep enough to please a seasoned Tool listener.<br />While overfamiliarity may cause you to skip 'Sober' (thanks again, damn radio. still a good song though), 'Undertow' is full of powerful, rythmic, yet artistic songs that are both emotionally and lyically impressive (dispite Maynard's over-reliance on dropping the F-bomb every six seconds).<BR> <BR>Once you listen to 'Undertow' from begining to end, you will also be stunned by the talent of the band: Maynard's soft-and-beautiful-yet-suddenly-powerful-and-teriffying voice is recognizable and fantastic, Danny's drumming is simply awe-inspiring and technically baffling, Adam proves that there is more to great guitar than jerk-off solos by showing creative riffs and effect placement, and Paul (no longer with the band) ties it all together with solid, driving bass lines.<br />Everything from the artwork to the hidden track(s) is dark, disturbing, and delicious.<br />So what it all comes down to is this: get 'Undertow'; and if I'm right, you'll like it. And then, if you want to dig deeper, go to 'Ænima' and then 'Lateralus'.<br /> -Analys.<br />P.S.: You can skip 'Opiate' unless you are a Tool buff who wants to hear the budding days of this incredible band.

B00005AAFS|5.0|Proving that even the heaviest anthems can drift into mainstream circulation with the proper mixture of video elements, technotronic outletting, and a need to set things ablaze, Rammstein managed an exorbitant amount success with their last outing, Sehnsucht. This wasn't without reason, either, because the performance was solid, reading like a book of anthems in a language I find myself struggling to dissect because my understanding of German isn't what it once was. Still, Mutter goes father into both the industrial spectrum and the more driven side of music as well, adding both the splendor of the beautiful into works where you wouldn't normally expect them as well as providing the pulsating hammer to drive their works further and faster.<br />The album begins with the spoken word piece, &quot;Mein Herz Brennt,&quot; giving one the impression that perhaps this album will lead into more tamed pastures before the heavier, pulsating sounds of &quot;Links 2 3 4,&quot; introduces the listener to what would be a fairer assessment of what to expect next. Other things are to the fray later, such as the beautiful sounds of the chorus in &quot;Sonne 4,&quot; combining a strangely angelic sing-a-long into the background at uneven intervals, or the ballad-rich tempo of &quot;Mutter,&quot; holding the attention well as the wheels of the industrial machine grinds on. This, combined with the terminal beat that infects the album, keeps it pressing forward in ways that throw interesting entanglements of sound effects, heavily crafted guitars, and beats into a dance-rich German barrage.<br />If you've yet to check into Rammstein, perhaps this wouldn't be the first album to start with, but it would definitely be something worthy of acquiring along with their last release. Both are enjoyable in their own right and give one an idea of the progression the band has undertaken on its road to stardom, not to mention how a pyromaniac German band continues on the road to success.
0345448898|5.0|I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that these books have a certain anti-Christian (or anti-Catholic) slant.  However, please keep in mind that this is a POINT OF VIEW of the author and as such cannot be criticized.  You can agree or disagree with it, argue for or against it, but simply saying that it's wrong is unwarranted.  Actually, I think the fact that these books make you contemplate your own position is what makes them worthwhile.<BR>In general, I thought the first two books were just incredible.  The third was weaker and I thought Pullman must have been in a hurry to get it out.  Still I consider this trilogy a must-read...

B00005JLS0|5.0|I always love Sandra Bullock, even when I dislike her movies, and I enjoy Hugh Grant, and fortunately have disliked very, very few of his films.  This is by far one of my favorite Sandra Bullock comedies, perhaps the one I have most enjoyed since WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.  I saw this immediately after seeing MAID IN MANHATTAN, and the two have a great deal in common.  Most importantly, both are romantic formula films, and I can't imagine anyone seeing either would harbor any doubts whatsoever about how each will end.  So, the question for a film like either of these is not how it is going to end, but the kind of trip it takes you on in getting to the preestablished destination.  I found the trip in TWO WEEKS NOTICE to be an utterly delightful one.<br />The key to a formula film is getting the viewers to like the main characters, and more than that, liking the idea of the two of them together.  I found both Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant's characters to be immensely likeable, and I enjoyed the chemistry the two had together, even before they realized they were romantically inclined towards one another.  If the film had a flaw, it was that we didn't get enough semi-romantic scenes before the last half hour of the movie.  Still, apart from one thing, I found the movie to be utterly delightful as a whole.  Not a masterpiece, but a heck of a lot of fun.  My one real gripe was a major bathroom scene.  Has potty humor ever improved a movie?  More to the point, has potty humor ever not harmed a film?  This was a major false note in an otherwise fun film.  I think anyone in the mood to see a pleasant romantic comedy will find this to be a thoroughly enjoyable film.

If the third movie is anywhere near this good the video Trilogy will certainly be considered a classic. All Tolkien fans will have to own these marvelous movies that do justice to the fantastic world of its creator. Is it perfect? No. But given the time restraints it is a fine piece of work. Do yourself a favor. Don't miss this one!

6304211740|2.0|I have been a big fan of Bronte sisters and their novels since I read them first at age 9.  Mr. Rochester was and has been the Ultimate fantasy man for me since then.  The complexity of his emotions and his tortured soul has prompted me to re-read this novel a few time.  How disappointing to see William Hurt's portrayal of this character.  Although I am a fan of Mr. Hurt, he should have been the last man to play Rochester.  Last weekend I watched this movie immediately after the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and I was truly disappointed.  Charlotte Gainsbourg played the title role effectively enough, given the fact that there was no chemistry between her and Mr. Rochester.  Finally, the dialogue in this version was rushed; the script altered so much so that it barely resembled the original.  If you have a couple of hours to kill, watch this movie but do not expect too much from it.  For an honest and true Jane Eyre Experience, check out the 1983's version staring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark. You will not be disappointed.
B000005H7D|5.0|Is &quot;Blue Train&quot; my favorite John Coltrane album? No, it isn't. Is it still a classic? You bet. Here is a record that captures the essence of cool and exudes style and grace so effortlessly, the music almost seems to float on air. John and his band give nothing less than 100% throughout this album, and their superb playing helped shape up what is now known as probably the most familiar jazz record that isn't performed by Miles Davis. It's been a while since I've listened to this album, but having recently gotten the newly packaged edition, I've reintroduced myself to a &quot;Blue Train&quot; that actually improves over the original recording. For one, the remastered version presents the album the way it was meant to be heard: clean and crisp. The incredible title track and &quot;Locomotion&quot; benefit most from the remastering, and Coltrane's sax playing is even more commanding this time around. Also, we get alternative versions of 2 tracks: the better of the two is &quot;Blue Train.&quot; On this version, Coltrane's playing differs quite significantly, but it works just as well. In addition, the disc has an enhanced portion for your PC where you can listen to retrospective interviews from engineer Rudy Van Gelder, as well as a brief black-and-white video where Coltrane is performing with Miles Davis onstage. So if you're new to Coltrane and are unsure which version of &quot;Blue Train&quot; to get, this baby is the one to pick up. The remastering provides a better sound, you get two bonus tracks, and there's a decent handful of extras to view/listen on your computer. &quot;Blue Train&quot; still holds up as a classic, and its remastering and repackaging are well deserved.

B000000H3Z|5.0|some people say this album is Thrash. some say its Death Metal. but the fact of the matter is that this album is Thrash/Death/Speed at its best. this was before they turned into a tribal/nu metal band. Max's voice is really aggressive and vicious. Andreas Kisser's guitar solo's shred. Paulo Jr's bass playing is quite good. but Igor Cavelera's drumming is OUTSTANDING. he pounds the hell out of it. he was only 19 years old in this album. and for a 19 yeard to play drums like this is more than impressive. the lyrics are sick and brutal. the riffs are killer. i highly reccomened this.

B000002JS6|5.0|When the lead singer of a band dies, it usually spells kaput for that group's future. Take a look at INXS, whose audience has all but disappeared after Michael Hutchence's suicide in 1997.  But for Aussie-bred rockers AC/DC, the opposite scenario happened. When original lead singer Bon Scott choked to death after a drinking binge, the band recruited Brian Johnson and recorded \\"Back in Black.\\"  It went on to sell a gazillion copies and took the rock-and-roll bad boys to unseen creative and commerical heights.  But \\"Back in Black\\"'s success is not unjustified.  In every sense of the word, it's a classic.  From the opener, \\"Hells Bells,\\" this album rocks with fierce and untamed aggression.  Truth be told, the hit \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" is NOT my favorite track on the album.  That distinction belongs to the title song, where Johnson's shrill scream compliments the dynamics of guitarist Angus Young.  \\"Have a Drink on Me,\\" \\"Shoot to Thrill,\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" are also killer cuts of note.  But while \\"Back In Black\\" rocks hard, many of the lyrics are unrepentantly sexist.  Then again, AC/DC ain't role models, nor do they want to be.  They view the world through the lens of a raging adolescent, defying authority, and singing songs about partying, booze, and girls.  \\"Back in Black\\" is a stick of rock and roll dynamite that explodes with energy.  Bon Scott woulda been proud.
B000000H57|5.0|After creating instant classic albums with \\"Slow, Deep, and Hard\\" and \\"Bloody Kisses\\", Type O Negative crafted another masterpiece with \\"October Rust\\"; their most eclectic album by far.  Pete Steele and co. range from Sabbath vibed heavy numbers like \\"Burnt Flowers Fallen\\" and \\"In Praise of Bacchus\\", and then turn the album's theme around with more groove oriented songs including the fan favorite \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\", and of course we can't forget \\"Love You to Death\\" now can we?  \\"Wolf Man\\", \\"Green Man\\", \\"Die With Me\\" and \\"Be My Druidess\\" are all great catchy goth vibed songs as well, and the funked out cover of Neil Young's \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" is musical ear candy.  While I still consider Type O's breakthrough \\"Bloody Kisses\\" a superior album, \\"October Rust\\" isn't far behind, and is an essential album for any Type O fan.
B000000H3W|5.0|one of the best albums in the genre of thrash. and IMO its the best album from Sepultura. this album is really hard and really fast. kinda similar to Beneath The Remains, but the only difference is that Arise is 10x darker than Beneath The Remains. if you liked Seasons In The Abyss from Slayer then you will definatly LOVE this album

Keith Simanton is full of [undesirable material], everyone I know loves this movie and think that is one of the funniest movies ever. Despite the features which only include director John Hughes shot by shot commentary the dvd is great, but I didn't get it for the extra features, I got for the movie. I highly recommend picking this movie up, it is so choice, if you have the means I suggest picking it up, and remember life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around, you'll miss one of the greatest films of all time. BUY IT YOU FOOL, BUY IT! You won't be dissappointed.

I've never been a huge fan of Shelley Long but she was very funny also. This movie had just enough romance in it to not make it cheesy. The renuivation of their dream house has taken a turn for the worse and if I say anything else I would be giving to much away. Please buy this movie, it will make you feel great.
B000002U9L|5.0|David Bowie's songs, combined with Trevor Jones's score, produces a masterpiece of a CD. Bowie's songs range from hyper, somewhat absurd fun (see - Chilly Down and Magic Dance) to stunningly beautiful, haunting romantic melodies (Within You especially, also As the World Falls Down). As always, Bowie's skill as a songwriter is matched only by his skill as a performer.<br />Trevor Jones's score is fabulous. Each note is perfectly crafted to blend into the movie with absolute skillfulness. There is not one single phrase that seems out of place; there is no room for improvement. <br />Despite the score fitting so perfectly with the movie, it's equally gorgeous on its own; a truly exquisite score, and one that every music-lover should listen to.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used's self-titled CD is the best I have heard in a while.  Easily one of the year's bests.  Though I must say, I wasn't as impressed after a first listen, but after really listening to what Bert is saying, you realize the beauty of the album.  Some seem to take away from the album's greatness because of some screaming, but it actually adds to the emotion of the songs....Bert has a great singing voice which is displayed in &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot;, &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot;, and &quot;On My Own.&quot;  This album has more emotion and flavor than any other I have heard this year, and is truly ground-breaking with their ability to mix the heavy rock with a melodic sound.  Buy the CD already.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|It's interesting juxtaposing this movie with the one that came out the day before it, \\"Attack of the Clones.\\"  While \\"Clones\\" was getting massacred by the critics (rightfully so) for its trite dialogue and 2nd grade acting, this baby was charming the pants off anyone who saw it.  \\"Clones\\" probably made 3 times what this one made, proving once again that there's no justice in the world. Though I saw both movies, it's \\"About a Boy\\" that will continue to charm those who get the DVD.  My definition of great comedy is being able to watch a scene over and over and still laugh like a loon, even though you know the joke is coming.  By that definition, \\"About a Boy\\" is a smashing success and proof that not all summer movie releases are driven by special effects, rather than story.  By the way, the extras on the DVD are stellar, from the Badly Drawn Boy video to the \\"English to English\\" translation.
B00003CXCD|3.0|It is believed that black-listed screenwriter Dalton Trumbo wrote ROMAN HOLIDAY in 18 days and got $50,000 through a \\"front\\" to pay for his living expenses and legal fees while he spent a year in jail for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.  If that's really the case, it's hard to find any hidden agenda or subliminal political message in this timeless romance.<br />Gregory Peck is an American journalist who, seeking an exclusive interview with Audrey Hepburn, a rebelling princess on the lam, pretends ignorance of her true identity when fate brings them together.  But Peck's plan falters as the two fall in love.<br />The film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and Audrey Hepburn won an Oscar© in this her first major role.  The late William Wyler was a masterful director who was  comfortable with a wide variety of stories and genres (The Best Years of our Lives, Ben Hur, The Collector).  His signature was letting the story be the star.<br />This fully restored print is breathtaking.  Extras include a \\"Remembering Roman Holiday\\" documentary, a featurette on the restoring process and a look at costumer Edith head's Paramount years. Recommended.
6302891272|4.0|I am a junior in Nagoya Int'l School, Japan, and in my English class, we are currently studying Macbeth. We have seen four different versions of Macbeth, one of them was \\"Throne of Blood,\\" from a talented Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa.<br />At the end of the movie, I was amazed at how Kurosawa managed to tell his audience about the universal themes from Macbeth (eg: greed, ambitions, obsessions) through Japanese culture! It never crossed my mind to think about a tragic hero in my own culture, which is Indonesia. I wonder what makes Kurosawa wanted to reproduce Macbeth's play in his own culture...<BR>Even though the language that he used is not as sophisticated as Shakespearean language and that he often 'bends' the conversation a little bit, but in the end it leads to the same climax as the original Macbeth's.<br />In this movie, Lady Macbeth (Asaji) is the one that was the most striking because she looked really cold and evil. Perhaps it was her make up, but her conversation and the way she is, especially when she talks (she sits down on the wooden floor and keeps still, without moving much) scares me the most! She looked really dangerous somehow. Kurosawa succeeded in creating this kind of character for Asaji because at the beginning, it was her who dominates Washizu (Macbeth) to try and get what's been prophesied to him. It was her who led Macbeth to his own destruction later.<br />I think Kurosawa is a brilliant man because he took the risk and in the end he produced a worth-to-watch movie, a classic one! What more can you ask???
B00005JL78|5.0|This is the 2nd best movie of 2002. It has ver good acting, great story, incredible visual effects, and the perfect soundtrack. The movie is set in 2054, with its central premise of \\"Precrime\\" law enforcement, totally reliant on three isolated human \\"precogs\\" capable of seeing the future. That's original, so I knew I'd enjoy this. I was at the edge of my seat in awe of how great this movie was, and it wasn't even over! Anyway, as Precrime's confident captain, Tom Cruise preempts these killings like a true action hero, only to run for his life when he is himself implicated in one of the precogs' visions. He makes one heck an escape, even has his eyes changed! Making good use of astonishing special effects, Minority Report brilliantly extrapolates a future that's utterly convincing, and pretty dang cool if you ask me. It knid of reminds me of A.I Artificial Intelligence. You must see this movie, it is so good. BUY IT NOW!
B0000797IO|4.0|Jennifer Aniston is a wonder in Mike White's darkly funny and mildly acerbic screenplay about a 30 year old, bored Texan who sees her life evaporating before her eyes and has a fling with her co-worker at a strip mall discount mart. John C. Reilly is Aniston's pothead house-painter husband and Jake Gyllenhaal is the ultra-sensitive lover named Holden (a la Holden Caulfield).  Director Miguel Arteta nails this foray that tip-toes into Flannery O'Connor territory.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is a spectacular movie. The special effects are kind of cheesy, but it is still a good movie. It's better than Superman and Batman! This is a must see movie. It's about a boy named Peter Parker (school nerd) who has a crush on Mary-Jane (school babe) and gets bit by a radio active spider and obtains really cool super powers and fights a villian named The Green Goblin who in reality is the father of Peter's only friend. You must see this. Some people will try to tell you that this is a joke, but it isn't. Although the venom (even of a radio active spider) couldn't effect the DNA of the person in anyway. You must see this today!
B00003CXCW|5.0|The greatest movie about Hollywood, SUNSET BOULEVARD is really a Gothic fairy tale about a not-so-innocent boy who gets lost in the woods and sells his soul to a witch. Former Golden Boy William Holden is dead-on (pun intended) as a down and out screenwriter who comes under the spell of Gloria Swanson's frozen in time silent star Norma Desmond.<br /><br />The late great Billy Wilder wrote the screenplay (with Charles Brackett) and directed this must have 1950 masterpiece that has not lost one iota of its power to entertain and disturb.<br /><br />The level of writing is superior and sustained. After they first meet, Holden says, \\"You used to be big.\\" Swanson replies, \\"I am big. It's the pictures that got small.\\" Holden mutters, \\"I knew there was something wrong with them.\\"<br /><br />Erich von Stroheim, who actually directed Swanson in the ill-fated Queen Kelly (1928), steals the show as Norma Desmond's faithful butler, protector (and first husband) Max.<br /><br />Swanson's bold and daring performance was overlooked by the Academy but has since become iconic. She was only 53 when the film was made and close ups of her face reveal undamaged skin -- smooth, wrinkle-free and youthful (she was a health nut).<br /><br />By the way, Desmond's house \\"in the 10,000 block of Sunset\\" was really the overgrown and empty home of one of J. Paul Getty's ex-wives a few blocks away on Wilshire. It's now a gas station.<br /><br />The meticulous transfer is crisp and clean and the extras include a fascinating making of documentary and an insightful commentary by Wilder scholar Ed Sikov.
078401213X|5.0|This movie has very interesting theory. It states that patterns exist everywhere: in nature, in science, in religion, in business. The main character is named Max Cohen. He is a mathematician searching for these patterns in everything. Yet, he's not the only one, and everyone from Wall Street investors, looking to break the market, to Hasidic Jews, searching for the 216-digit number that reveals the true name of God, are trying to get their hands on Max. This has alot going for it, and it delivers all the way. It is one of my favorite movies, and I highly suggest seeing this movie as soon as possible.
B00003CXCW|5.0|&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; doesn't need any more amateur endoresments, its status as a classic long since established.  The real news of this DVD release is the staggering job Paramount has done in mastering the film to video.  I have never seen, even from the vaunted artistes at Criterion, a master to compare with this one.  Paramount's soon-to-be-famous 2000 line resolution method has produced a version of this film with unmatched detail.  Just take a look at the scenes inside Norma's mansion: you can pick up the brilliant details of Hans Drier's staggering art design as never before.  Subtle variations in texture, tone and pattern emerge with startling clarity, and add, rather than detract, from the sub-textual meanings of the film.  <br />With this, and the lovely new DVD of &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, Paramount has set the bar at a new height for all the companies producing DVD's for the home market.  Even Criterion needs to sit up and take notice.  Too bad, though, Paramount didn't apply the same level of care to its DVD version of &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;: a glaring, overexposed eyesore which nearly trumps Hitchcock's glittering little amusement.
B000069HK2|4.0|My girlfriend's been tallking about this band The Used for a while and I was like well let me borrow the cd&quot; and I did and I went and got it that day.  I'd heard them on my Warped Tour cd and hadn't paid much attention to them but after hearing their full length I'm impressed.  The only song I wasn't into was Maybe Memories.  Blue and Yellow, Box Full Of Sharp Objects, Taste Of Ink, and On My Own are probably my faveorite tracks on here.  I fully recommend them to any fan of Thursday, Finch, The Distillers, and Glassjaw.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Ben-Hur defined in the 50's the way to make an epic, this movie redefines It in a class by itself, the production work is amazing , really inmersing us in the roman empire witout loosing detail, the opening sequence portraits the \\"armamentarium Romanum\\", and the discipline and tactics that made the roman army the world's conqueror, the computer work it's very weel done, without abusing and recreates ROME with ultimate details, and the actors are fine in their roles<br />A classic that deserves the crown of victory among epic films, Salve Gladiator!
0783217048|5.0|I was hesitant to see this film, because I thought it would be an Americanized version of &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,&quot; which was a wonderful film in itself. But &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; was so much more! It was a delightful piece of heaven with three charming angels! :) Initially, I really didn't think such macho men like Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes could pull off playing refined ladies of drag, but they were FABULOUS! And John Leguizamo was great - as anticipated - such an incredibly talented actor! And the story, was charming. Such heart! <BR><br />While most of the film was fun-loving and light-hearted, I was moved by some of the &quot;heavier&quot; issues as well: Rich boy Swayze is rejected by his family because of his drag life; Swayze is almost molested by a bad cop, who thinks to take advantage of a &quot;lady&quot; on the road; Snipes' character inadvertantly reaches out to a withdrawn woman, a small town turns a blind eye to a battered woman, but Swayze's &quot;queen&quot; cannot; and all three queens help the women of a small town to empower themselves and play in a world of glamor and beauty. It was very empowering to watch these men dressed as women make such a wonderful statement for so many communities (whether they intended to do so or not). As someone else posted here, it's mainly about acceptance and love and the power those things can have in one's life.<br />&quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!&quot;
B00005NC66|5.0|\\"Breathless,\\" Jean-Luc Godard's tribute to moviemaking itself and one of the seminal titles of the French New Wave, is, jump-cuts and all, a film that changed the way movies were made. It introduced audiences and critics alike to new voices in the cinema, to a newer and cheaper guerrilla-style film made on location and to the sort of movie aware of the fact that it was just a movie.<br />That said, though, this movie is a lot of just pure fun. In the leads, Jean-Paul Belmondo and the absolutely gorgeous Jean Seberg seem to inject their portrayals of young thief-and-killer Michel Poiccard and his indecisive American girlfriend Patricia with a sense of humor and joy. The couple they portray are given moments where they're not really pushing the action forward, where they're reveling in what it feels like to be young and in lust, if not love. The scenes where they're lying in bed just talking or riding together in a car and talking about Paris are perhaps the most delightful aspect of the film.<br />Even though the character of Michel is almost certainly doomed from the moment he steals a car and guns down a police officer, he has a lot of fun with his last days, wandering the streets, stealing from friends and trying to get Patricia to sleep with him. Patricia, likewise, is given moments of joy, despite worrying about her pregnancy and job, wondering if she should betray the man she loves to the police or run away with him to Rome.<br />That spirit, in addition to its technical wizardry and the passion of its makers, is what made the film different in 1960, and it's the spirit behind it that just makes \\"Breathless\\" fun Sunday-afternoon viewing now.
6302891272|4.0|Hi, Im a student at Nagoya International School (in Japan). And i am a Japanese citizen. Im a Jr at this school. My classmates and I are learning about Shakespear. And recently, we have been reading &quot;Macbeth&quot; for English class. <br />There were many similarities with the Kurosawa production and Shakespear`s work. It seems as though Kurosawa have stolen the whole consept of the story because the whole idea was the same.But the thing is that there wasnt the &quot;richness of Shakespear&quot; in the Kurosawa`s movies. Instead, there was a great deal of beauty in the scenery, and how they used the fogs. As I have said there was no richness in thier words, the movie was good as the Shakespear`s work by the tone of the actor, had wonderful actors. But over all, i gave this movie a 4 because it was as good as Shakespear`s work but I disliked the way their lines were said too quickly for me to follow that was going on. As well as there were all of these extra scenery of Miki on a horse being lost in the fog for like a couple scenes.... quite a waste!! But over all,i guess its ok. I reccomend this movie to a foreign speaker (not Japanese) because you just have to follow the words. Being bilingual for the movie was not a good thing where the lines werent that accurate. Which made me a bit complicated where just listening them speak in Old Japanese was hard to follow as well.
B00005JLS0|3.0|Sandra Bullock's still got a cute and winning screen personality, and Hugh Grant plays a charming-enough scoundrel. You know going in to the movie what to expect, for the two of them will battle yet fall in love. But I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I was going to, for the screenplay is given moments of true inspiration.<br />Bullock plays Lucy, a liberal-minded activist lawyer, educated at Harvard, who gets tricked into believing that she'll help her humanitarian causes by becoming assistant to Grant's George, a self-centered mogul with money but no ethics. He mainly hires her so that he can, at first, compromise all of her beliefs while, at the same time, annoying his family, who don't like women lawyers for some unexplained reason.<br />But, as they interact, George finds that all Lucy's quirks, difficulties and opinionated stances make her sorta charming and invaluable to him. He finds over time that he cannot make a decision without her, which leads her to give her resignation.<br />So George has two weeks to make Lucy stay, and she has two weeks to determine whether she really wants to go ... or if she kind of likes being under someone's confidante.<br />And that's when the actors' chemistry starts to work for them. The plot, though obviously formulaic, does manage SOME rare moments of ingenuity, particularly in the characterization of Lucy's brilliant, activist mother, played very well by veteran character actress Dana Ivey.<br />It's not a gem of a movie, but it's not a complete dud. Still, after Grant's great work in \\"About a Boy,\\" it's a shame he had to do something so trite.
0767811070|5.0|MY FAVORITE MOVIE, IN THE WORLD, NEXT TO PURPLE RAIN!
B00005JLSC|5.0|God, this movie is fun. When you watch it, the daring it took to make it and to make it so well - with this cast, in this way and in 2002 - jumps off the screen and forces you to tap your feet to the music. <br />It's a quickly-paced, vibrant film filled with gusto performances from mostly everyone involved, though I'm not sure if Richard Gere's Jimmy Durante-style singing quite works for the soundtrack. (Still, Gere's take on the slimy lawyer, when he's not singing, is pretty great.) <br />By taking on the role of murderess Roxie Hart, Renee Zellweger proves, more than ever, that she's a damn good actress. <br />Trimming the source-material stage show to its basics and adding the premise that all the musical numbers occur within Roxie's fame-hungry brain, director Rob Marshall and Bill Condon have created a spectacle that, hopefully, will resurrect, moreso than \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" the mainstream movie musical.
0066214122|3.0|A rather disappointing effort on the part of otherwise outstanding author. The topic has an enormous potential, which in this book didn't get the full measure of Mr. Crichton's  talent. Good analogy would be a 007 movie, where you relish the realism until it occasionally devolves into ridiculous and unlikely spectacle. <BR>The use of too many clichés and simplistic language along with inferior chracter development further diminishes reading experience. <br />On a positive note, Mr. Crichton, as usual, delivers an exciting dose of engrossing  technical detail and intellectual insight. Fast and exciting pace (after a slow beginning) keeps the reader glued. But don't put it down, as you may not be drawn to pick it back up.<br />Verdict: An utterly interesting topic and accompanying insight, diminished by a disappointing treatment and execution.
B000065V1V|5.0|From the first chords of &quot;Sunday,&quot; the lead song on David Bowie's latest CD, &quot;Heathen,&quot; I was reminded how I felt in 1977 listening to the revolutionary &quot;Low&quot; album for the very first time. Let's be clear here: this is an album that gets BETTER with each and every listen, NOT staid and tiring. When he sings, &quot;Everything has changed,&quot; you'd better believe it, boys and girls, because Bowie is dead-on--this is his BEST music in many many years. &quot;Cactus&quot; is truly timeless music, with some of his old &quot;Lodger&quot; backup vocal styles, &quot;Slip Away&quot; is a wonderful remembrance of an old 1970s NY radio personality, armed with rich vocals and a great bass line.<br />Yes, Bowie is back--and it doesn't get much better than this. My God, &quot;Slow Burn&quot; is another of those eerie, amazing songs written and recorded BEFORE September 11th; The cover of Neil Young's &quot;I've Been waiting For You,&quot; is great, too--it really rocks!  Song for song, this CD is addictive! &quot;5:15, The Angels Have Gone&quot; is hauntingly beautiful--the first time my children heard it, they were so enchanted they asked me to &quot;Play It Again, daddy!&quot; I complied, and now THEY are telling their 10 &amp; 12 year old buddies about how cool Bowie's music is.<br />Ah, David Bowie: The Next Generation!<br />It's no secret that &quot;Everyone Says 'Hi&quot; has been a favorite of the professional reviewers, as well as &quot;A Better Future&quot; and the title track, but one of my absolute favorites comes on the bonus CD, &quot;Conversation Piece,&quot; which was written, I believe in 1969 (!) and re-recorded recently. It just knocks me out.<br />If there is anything I didn't warm up to, it was the sophomoric old version of &quot;Panic in Detroit&quot; on the BONUS cd. THAT i could have done without. But seriously, if you are a Bowie admirer (not someone who only listens to &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;), you will LOVE &quot;Heathen.&quot;<br />Just take my advice: Play it again...and again...and again. It will become one of your all-time favorites.n.&quot;<br />Just take my advice: Play it again...and again...and again. It will become one of your all-time favorites.
B00005JL0I|5.0|I love the bond series and own them all. When i found out about Casino Royale I had to have it. Finding out it wasn't a bond movie was, at frist, a little weird to me, but if you watch it you'll understand. It's not an action mystery, it's a full out insain comedy and probably the best movie of all times.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Despite the fact that this movie's plot often strayed quite far from Tolkien's book, it is still a masterpiece. The sets are absolute eye-candy, the screenplay in moving, and the action is heart-pumping. It is also not overly-dramatic as the first Lord of the Rings movie. I'd recommend it to any film fan, and to any extremely open-minded Tolkien fan; it's thoroughly enjoyable.
B00004W50T|4.0|I never know quite what to make of bonus tracks on very familiar albums like this one, especially since the order of songs on the original \\"Big Pink\\" was a fairly integral part of the album's greatness.  Still, when I heard the Band's catalogue was going to be reissued with previously unreleased songs added, I was thrilled.  Not all of the new songs add much to their already-brilliant surroundings, but some of them are definitely welcome.<br />Although I consider the eponymous \\"brown album\\" and \\"Stage Fright\\" just a little bit better than their predecessor, there are individual songs on \\"Big Pink\\" that I prefer to anything else the Band ever did.  \\"The Weight\\" is still as close to musical perfection as I ever expect to hear, \\"Long Black Veil\\" is one of the all time great covers (they really make the often-copied classic their own), and the fire-and-brimstone imagery of \\"To Kingdom Come\\" puts most similarly-themed lyrics to shame.  On the other hand, for all the credit this album gets for rebelling against late-`60s excess, it does sound dated in a few places.  I've always considered the arrangements of \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\" and \\"I Shall Be Released\\" found here to be inferior to the versions they recorded with Bob Dylan a year earlier.  (They reportedly recorded an alternate take of the latter with Richard Manuel singing in his normal range rather than the falsetto; I was hoping that would be one of the bonus tracks, but it isn't.)<br />Perhaps it's appropriate, then, that the quality of the \\"new\\" songs varies widely as well.  Five of the titles are also found on \\"The Basement Tapes,\\" and the arrangements here are mostly similar to those, but there are surprises.  \\"Long Distance Operator\\" sounds at first like a cleaner recording of the same take you know and love, but it features an added verse and an abbreviated ending.  \\"Orange Juice Blues\\" is an even more stripped-down take than the familiar one, with just an upright piano for backup.  Among the other bonus tracks, \\"Key to the Highway\\" is the real gem, perhaps the only one of the bunch that was worthy of a spot on the original LP.  \\"Ferdinand the Imposter\\" is, well, interesting, but so primitive that it's hard to know what to make of it.  The instrumental backing is uncharacteristically sloppy, and Rick's vocal delivery is fuzzy even by the infamous standards of this album.  The only real dud is the alternate take of \\"Lonesome Suzie,\\" which is both awkwardly arranged and much too fast and poppy to fit the melancholy lyrics.  (On the other hand, it makes me appreciate the \\"official\\" version a lot more than I used to!)<br />Bottom line: more casual fans will probably be happy with the original album, especially if you prefer their later work.  Those of you who like the pre-Band recordings with Dylan will definitely want at least some of the bonus tracks, not to mention the (at least marginally) improved sound quality of the original ones.
B000063DI8|3.0|This is not one of Maiden's best albums. I would put it near the bottom of the barrel. It seems that they got rather lazy in trying to produce good music, and settled for a more raw style. There is nothing wrong with a raw sound, and I prefer a raw sound to production. Unfortunately, the song listing here is rather subpar. The band seems layed back, and not really putting forth as much effort as their previous releases. The album really has no central theme, and the track listing seems disorganized.     \\"Tailgunner\\" is a catchy tune, with the bass line, and mid-paced guitar. \\"Hooks In You\\" isn't bad, and the title track is a good slow-paced rocker that kind of shows Maiden's soft side. \\"Bring You Daughter...to the Slaughter\\" is horrible, and was voted the worst heavy metal song of the year. The opening guitar riffs are great before the song goes into its repetitive, clunky chorus. \\"Holy Smoke\\" could have been better, although the video has its laughs. I can't believe that both of those horrid songs were actually singles too! These two songs are why I only give this album 3 stars. If you are a collector, like me, that buys every album from a band you like, get it. But if you are after Maiden's best work, go after \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\" or \\"Brave New World.\\"
0345448898|5.0|I keep returning to this book over and over again. Everytime I read it, I discover something new inside of it. Pullman writes this story fantastically, and the plot develops seamlessly through all three books. I have enthusiastically recommended it to many friends.<BR>Being Jewish, the part about The Church didn't really bother me or strike me a blasphemous. Though there are violent and rather dark themes in the book, the main point of the novel is a lovely story of the coming of age of two kids, Lyra and Will.<BR>I strongly recommend this book for ages 11 and up. Kids younger than that won't pick up on many of the important aspects of the novel, and frankly, some kids are just too young for the cold blood murder and dark subject matter of this book.<BR>This set of novels is a great gift, especially for a kid who is very bright or loves to read. I even got my parents to read them, and they enjoyed the trilogy as much as I did!
B0000024RQ|4.0|This is a versatile album showcasing the many sides of Bob Dylan. Even as early as 1962/63, before the Vietnam War was in full effect, Dylan was singing about war, revolution and politics with the anthem \\"Blowin in the Wind,\\" and the bitter \\"Masters of War,\\" in which Dylan actually has a deathwish for people involved with the war effort, mainly politicians. The tone of his guitar, mixed in with his expressive vocals (a rarity for Dylan) makes this a shocking experience. <BR><BR>But, the anti-war side isn't all we get from Dylan in this tour de force. We get Dylan's romantic side, with the reminiscent and eerily passionate \\"Girl From the North Country,\\" and the breakup song \\"Don't ThinK Twice, It's Alright.\\" We also get Dylan's stream of consciousness poetry in \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" \\"A Hard Rain\\" and \\"I Shall Be Free,\\" as well as some reworked, quirky blues numbers (\\"Down The Highway,\\" \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\"). Despite that it was all acoustic, this is basically a statement that not all acoustic/folk music is the same, and who better captures all those different moods with a mediocre voice and an acoustic guitar better than Bob Dylan? This was the album that introduced him to the world, and was the floodgate for subsequent albums.
0312305060|5.0|This wonderful book, almost a novella, will haunt you long after you've finished the last page.  In fact, you may want to reread it.  Surprisingly, the current movie version is an excellent adaptation of this insightful and thought provoking work.  However, if you can possibly avoid seeing the film until you've read the book on which it is based, do so!  Without preaching, the author manages to make exquisit commentary on the complexities and many aspects of Happiness.  You should come away from the experience enthralled.

B00007GZQI|3.0|The picture quality of this dvd is full-bodied and sharp in comparison to earlier video releases where the tone was cloudy and muddy and a little too yellow. The picture is full frame which is sad but we can't expect Criterion treatment all the time! There's not too much wear, except  early in the film where speckles and edge enhancements make guest appearances from time to time but having seen this film in theaters, on video and even network TV, I must say it's the best that may ever be presented.<br />The only annoying aspect is the so called &quot;Dolby Digital 2.0&quot;<BR>you might as well just say &quot;enhanced mono&quot; the highs are slightly muffled and the lows are hollow and the songs are left without their Badfinger punch. <br />But at least listenable and good to see this wonderful Ringo Starr and Peter Sellers satirical comedy  available in at least a  half way decent format. No extras not even a theatical trailer, but again this isn't Criterion, whereby if it was we may have been lucky to have  gotten a running commentary by Mr. Starr or at least a brief  video introduction.<br />Most recent reviews state this film is rather dated, however the nucleus of the film still rings true today, if not more so, that everyone has their price.... and the price tag on  this DVD is at least worth every pence!
B000059POY|2.0|I have to be honest here, this movie is, well, bad.  It's absurd, hammy to a fault, over-long, and I'm being nice.  There really isn't a plot.  If there is, it's: bunch of Hollywood heavies try to cheese their way into young unknown's, um, affections. I read about this film, but if I hadn't it would seem more like an excuse for some middle aged stars to get together and try to tassel with a hot young vixen, than a collection of good talent trying to make a comedic film.  Well, I'm sure Buck Henry and Christian Marquand said they were making an art film and everybody bought it.  I can't believe it got made (with this cast though, who wouldn't make it?).  But hey, good for them.<br />Now I said I thought it was bad, but it did have some redeeming qualities.  Several of these guys are pretty funny, some are not.  Brando's bit was good and I laughed at Coburn too.  Burton was hillarious.  Starr, Matthau, and Huston don't fair as well, but their material wasn't as good.  And then there is the sweetness herself, Eva Aulin.  Wow, she is hot.  Oh the poor girl, she looks way too innocent to blame for no script.  Anyone who didn't know better would have taken the part to act next to these guys.  And lets be honest, she wasn't cast for her thespian intellect.<br />Hey if you like these stars, Candy may be worth the rent.  By the way I think this film was worth seeing just to read what some of you internet movie maniacs wrote about it, so thanks.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Disney seems to make great things with other companies (see Kindom Hearts) and Monster Inc. is a great example of this. While it isn't a funny as Toy Story it is better then a Bug's life. The boogie man is real and monsters really do live inside your closet in this movie. The door roller coaster is defiantly the best part of the movie along with little Boo. I can't wait to see what magic Disney &amp; Pixar make the next time around.
B000002KB8|4.0|This is not the best or most famous Sabbath album, but it still has some gems, especially Warning. It's the only Sabbath album that is very 60's and hippie in its rhythm, so it's kind of a serendipity album. The one thing I don't like is that some riffs are repeated between songs, and actually sound a lot like some of the riffs by Eric Clapton in the album Fresh Cream. But it's still a must-have for the serious Sabbath fan.
B00003CXXM|1.0|At least they waited till Ludlum was dead before releasing this movie.  To see a story with struggling vivid characters ripped into a dull puppet play.  Well the two stories had amnesia, Jason Bourne, and the continent of Europe in common.  Otherwise the story is incredibly sad.  If you'd like to see a glimpse of what this movie should be then rent The Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain.  It at least tells a story worth actually telling.  Oh and if you have trouble finding it that's probably because the Bourne Identity is a drama not an action story.
B000002KHH|5.0|Paranoid is the 2nd Sabbath album, and it captures the band as youthful, relatively sober, and very talented. Ozzy's young voice is earnest, strong, and clear, unlike later albums. There are 4 metal classics on this album--War Pigs, Paranoid, Ironman, and Fairies Wear Boots, making it a must-have for all fans of metal. I think the only Sabbath album that's better may be Sabotage, but you never hear that album's songs on the radio. Paranoid was perhaps THE album that brought an end to idealistic 60's music and ushered in the age of dark, heavy rock that inspired thousands of rock groups for the next 30 years.

6305558167|5.0|John Boorman's 1981 Excalibur is the finest interpretation of the Arthur legends that have graced the screens of Hollywood. Scored with dramatic music, containing a superb cast of actors and detailed with lush cinematography, this is a film that looks even better on DVD. On DVD, the experience is theatrical, digitally remastered for quality sound and picture. Once more we are taken to the magic realm of Camelot, this time we experience Excalibur like never before. The generation that saw Excalibur as  teens or young adults, can now enjoy special bonus features, such as director's commentary, deleted scenes that never made it to the original release as well as view the original movie trailer. Excalibur precisely follows the text of Malory's classic, \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\". The story is age-old, and layed with allegory. Arthur, as a young boy, grew up in a lawless, power-hungry society without a king, that of a Celtic Britain. Through the aid of the sage wizard Merlin, Arthur become king of England and carries with him the invincible sword, Exalibur. Arthur's responsibility is heavy. He maintains peace and creates an ideal society that is protected by the mighty, righteous Knights of the Round Table, who embark on a quest for the Holy Grail, which is the ultimate divine gift from God to mankind and the only promise of hope and peace. <br />But along the way, the knights discover how fragile the ideal can be, especially when human flaws bar the way. Lancelot, Arthur's champion knight, engages in an adulterous affair with Arthur's wife, Queen Guenevere. Morgana, Arthur's sister and a witch, bears Arthur's son through dark magic, Mordred, whom she raises to defy Arthur and lead a rebellion. After Guenevere and Lancelot's affair is made public, the Round Table is dissolved by the impurity and corruption of the Knights and a war ensues, which results in Mordred and Arthur's death. Excalibur is returned to the Lady Of The Lake, whose white-sleeved hand takes the sword down into the lake in the moonlight, and Arthur is taken to Avalon, where he is to be healed and prepared for a victorious return. <br />Boorman tinges the film with symbolism and a cool, toned color that provides suspense and builds mood. The dark of night is very black, the fires (from torches or from battlefields) are very red, and the use of the color green in the forest and in the glow of the knight's armor and Excalibur itself, symbolizes the magic and the primitive nature that surrounds ideals of peace. It is an opposite to the man-made things, weapons and fortresses. The music is effectively dramatic. For the ending of the film, Boorman used excerpts from Wagner's \\"Ring of the Nibelung\\" opera \\"Twilight Of The Gods\\", the orchestral Funeral March for the hero Siegfried, and the scenes with Guenevere and Lancelot engaging in trysts in the woods, giving into their \\"natural\\" instincts  includes the romantic prelude to Tristan and Isolde. For the battle scenes, the choral work, \\"O Fortuna\\" from Orff's Carmina Burana sends chills down our spines. Excalibur on DVD is a must see and a great addition to a collection of quality fantasy films. Although some claim the material can at times be violent, it is still very much in the lines of Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings. It would make a perfect addition to your DVD collection. Five stars for a great film. Stars Nigel Terry as Merlin, whose mysterious presence graces the screen with eloquence and power, and there are special appearances by Helen Mirren and a young Liam Neeson.
B000001E8S|4.0|This is really quite special, a marriage of U2's pop sensibilities and Brian Eno's ambient techniques. The disc as a whole is outstanding. I particularly enjoy listening to it at night, as it feels a little &quot;dark&quot;.<br />My two favorite tracks are Miss Sarajevo (featuring a bit by Luciano Pavoroti) and &quot;Elvis Ate America&quot;<br />When listening to this I have often had people comment that they like it, want to know who it is, and whether I know where they can buy a copy.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|The Western genre's most enduring and charming film only gets better and better as the years go by, seeming to remain ageless and timeless.  Whenever I'm asked to name my favorite movie this is the one I often claim is, though during the holiday season I would be inclined to name one of those seasonal venerable classics.   Decades past it's original release Newman's and Redford's inspired teaming in this feature still plays to packed houses in revival theaters; hardly a person is alive who leaves a theater showing of it and doesn't come out reciting the memorable banter between the two.  Filled with eminently quotable dialogue, rich colorful characterizations and many unforgettable sequences it is one of the most pleasurable movie experiences to be had.<br />Containing as much inventive fiction as historical accuracy, 'Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid' both comically and dramatically recounts the exploits of the two legendary and affable outlaws of the title, known formally as Robert Leroy Parker and Harry Longbaugh respectively   While there is still continuing debate about the facts surrounding the duo that won't taint your enjoyment of this picture at all; the equitable melding of myth and reality serves as an enrichment and not a detriment.  A straightforward telling of the then known facts simply would not have served any moviegoer and certainly not the fine company of actors gathered here.  The two stars have never been more likable and a stellar cast of secondary players supports them supremely, most notably Katherine Ross who plays Etta Place, the Kid's girlfriend.  The wonderful character actor Strother Martin is cast in another memorable appearance as American prospector Percy Garris who the two encounter on their ill-fated trip to Bolivia.  While the movie is episodic and characters appear and disappear generally not to be seen again, 'Butch And Sundance' never gets pat or tiresome.  Cleverly constructed, well paced and beautifully photographed it isn'thard to see why this film has had such lasting appeal to viewers of multiple generations.  Also worth mentioning is the Burt Bacharach composed and conducted original music score featuring the hit song &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head&quot; that he co-wrote with Hal David.  I especially love the sequence of the film when this song is played; while some may argue that it is incongruent with the rest of the movie it serves to accentuate the feelings that Etta has for both of the men.  She would have just as been likely to have ended up falling in love with Butch as she did Sundance and this short and engaging scene neatly conveys that without being schmaltzy or clumsy.  Not really a Western per se, not really a drama and not really a pure comedy the movie transcends all these classifications and forges it's own territory as a rare gem, distinctive and graceful.<br />The DVD edition is absolutely fabulous with terrific extras that you really want to see and not padded with those excruciatingly boring deleted scenes that have become so blasé on recently released DVD's of films of the past decade.  The &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary, the interviews with the cast members and the audio commentary are also all well done and the movie transfer is flawless.  If 'Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid' is a film you enjoy watching then I strongly recommend purchasing the DVD, it's a great addition to any collection.<br />Noteworthy: Ross played Etta Place once again in the successful 1976 made for television movie 'Wanted: The Sundance Woman'.
0195145925|2.0|Basically what this book boils down to is this: there are difficulties with the treatment of time in theoretical physics. Does it occupy a separate dimension in space-time? Why does it appear to run only in one direction? Can it run backwards, as it seems in theory that it might be able to? To answer the riddle of time, Julian Barbour has made a novel proposition: that time does not exist.<br />Here is a crude summary of his hypothesis. Our universe exists within a configuration space that he calls Platonia, which defines all possible configurations of matter and energy in all possible universes. As the configuration of the universe changes moment-by-moment, it \\"moves\\" within Platonia. But the possible configurations are discrete and static (what the author calls Nows), so what appears to an observer as motion and time is actually just infinitesimal leaps within Platonia. Each configuration is dependent on the last, and no other next configuration, outside of those made possible by the vanishingly small variations allowed by the uncertainty principle and the wave functions that govern probability, is likely.<br />It's certainly a new way of looking at things, and by tossing aside the notion of an absolute time, it might make some of the physical equations that seem to describe the universe easier to apply. It also does a nifty job of explaining why time cannot be manipulated as such, and why it doesn't run backwards every so often. Even if the universe ceases expansion due to gravity and eventually collapses in a Big Crunch (and his theory does not predict anything about that), time will not flow backwards because the discrete configurations during the contraction phase are still dependent on what came before.<br />However, we still have this little problem of the appearance of time. Just because the universe resides in only the present fleeting moment does not necessarily mean that there was no history leading up to any particular configuration. One must still lookback at all of the previous configurations to the beginning of the universe to explain the universe as it is Now.<br />Just as the Newtonian laws of motion work well at nonrelativistic speeds, the concept of time has enormous usefulness here in the macroscopic world. Barbour may disagree, but it still means something to say that an event happened so many years ago, even if the difference is measured not by time but by the number of discrete configurations of the universe between then and Now.<br />Barbour's theory of a timeless universe does not make any predictions about how the universe may have come about in the first place. It may yet, but he does not present anything here. Perhaps it was buried in his rambling about the supposedly all-encompassing Wheeler-DeWitt equation, and I just missed it.<br />Admittedly, I am a layman. I cannot tell whether Barbour's theory has any predictive value. I would think that if it did, Barbour would have at least hinted at what it might be. As it is, I am left with the impression that he considers the implications \\"intuitively obvious to the casual observer\\", as they used to say in my college physics courses. That leaves me exactly nowhere. I can't tell that his theory of a timeless universe actually accomplishes anything other than justifying the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the timeless zero energy Schroedinger equation, neither of which were reproduced in the book.<br />The epilogue, in which he explores the philosophical implications of a timeless universe, is pretty much useless speculation grouped under section headers like, \\"Does Free Will Exist?\\" and \\"Is There A Role For A Creator In Quantum Cosmology?\\" and even \\"Where Is Heaven?\\" Thankfully, he doesn't seem to conclude the existence of the Judeo-Christian god, but this sort of stuff is out of place here.<br />The argument for a timeless universe is not laid out terribly well. Granted, this is his attempt at convincing people that are a lot smarter than I am that a different framework for looking at the universe is needed. But the best science popularizations leave you feeling smarter, and I'm not so sure that I do.

038533348X|5.0|Perhaps Vonnegut's masterwork...although many would argue for Slaughterhouse.  This appears to be the start of Kurt's insane phase which seems to span from Cat's Cradle all the way until Galapagos, give or take.  Where this books tops many of his 'insane era' novels is it is more a mesh of his early, 'money-making' novels where he tried to follow more traditional writing guidelines (i.e. Mother Night, Player Piano).  Again, many will disagree, but due to Cat's Cradle combining Vonnegut's insanity and early Orwellian/Huxlian style this book is ultimate read to truly taste Kurt's entire pallate (of course, ignoring the later 'Bitter, Old Man' phase [Bluebeard, Timequake]).<br />For those looking to sample the taste of a brilliant, raving lunatic, which is Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is the true paterfamilias, not Slaughterhouse.
B00005JKG7|5.0|It is so eeerie that The Fog still has an weird effect on me today, 10+ years later. I see fog now and this movie keeps coming back. I will never forget Adrienne's solemn monochromatic voice in this film, too chilling. Jamie was a babe actress to me then and she was good. I recommend the DVD because the transfer makes it even scary....
B000066NW0|5.0|I think this lady is an extremely talanted musician and singer. I really enjoy this record of hers and you will too. You should definetly get this album you will not be dissapointed!!!!
B000002TPS|4.0|Well, if some people can say that this marvellous album was a sell out by Megadeth, a new word will have to be invented to define what Metallica did, ha, ha!<br />While RUST IN PEACE was a furious display of master technique to introduce the sheer power adn ability of the new line up, YOUTHANASIA concentrated on giving more focus, melody and great lyrics to the songs. <br />The album flows effortless from one song to another. All of them a good, there´s not a single one throwaaway or explicit filler. It´s one of the best Megadeh albums, no doubt about that. <br />The real bad turning point would come with RISK, not with YOUTHANASIA !!
B000005S0D|5.0|If you like Pink Floyd and Alan Parsons Project, then you should like Camel. This CD is one of my favorite CDs, the songs are just awesome, especially &quot;Refugee&quot;, &quot;West Berlin&quot;, &quot;Vopos&quot; and &quot;Long Goodbyes&quot;. You will love &quot;Stationary Traveller&quot; because there is not doubt about it, it is just one of the best Camel's albums along with &quot;Single Factor&quot;.
B000002HRE|1.0|Well, well, the most expressive case of a band totally selling out. THis is the case with LOAD and his inferior sequel, RELOAD (an album made of the leftovers of LOAD! CAn you imagine that?!)<br />What is the most annoying thing, beside the commercial change of direction, is the arrogance of this band. Somehow, they managed to construct a whole new base of nu-metal or MTV fans, even making stupid MTV videos and sharply dropping the quality of their lyrics.<br />Of course they´re not kids anymore, I understand they tried to slow the pace down, but the songs here are simply bad, lazy. <BR>Kirk Hammett, instead of improving, is recording inferior solos all around! Amazing!!<br />And the interviews... It´s always Lars and JAmes talking about \\"I don´t care.\\" \\"We play what we want\\", etc, etc... Such arrogance is something I never expected from them. At least Jason Newsted figured it out and jumped ship in time. I bet he´s happpier now,a way from those two megalomaniacs that only care about money now.<br />I don´t care if a band changes direction and try new stuff. But just compare the new songs with the past songs!!! Which ae best, even without taking in consideration the fact that we´re talking about differetne syles? OF course MASTER OF PUPPETS is better than RELOAD. Of course RIDE THE LIGHTNING is better than RELOAD. And so on and so on...<br />Deu to some sort of mass hypnozis, Metallica continues to sell. At least their live set is still strong.
B000069HK2|5.0|Okay, well im sick of people saying they like the CD but not the Screaming in it. Well that is what makes this CD what it is. The whole screaming thing what Bert does in the way he does it isnt just unique but it is brilliant and it is what makes the used, the used. This CD is the best ive ever purchased and i do have a large collection, although ive do have a sick feeling that this cd will soon be put with the CDs what i had when i was 10. Unfortunatly many bands today are being captured by this Pop/Punk disease. Although The Used are not Punk 'Taste Of Ink' does have that pop/punk sound to it. The rest of the CD is a different class. But we all know what pop/punk people are like, they hear one poppy song and even if the rest of the songs on a album sound nothing like pop/punk they say they like the other songs just to try and be hip and cool. And i know so britney lovers have shown their true feelings in some of these reviews saying that they dont like screaming, that would be because you britney ears are not used to such a sound. I hope to god these guys dont get caught by the infectious disease sweaping the music industry, if they do then i will be very annoyed. If you like pop then stick with britney, dont try and like stuff you dont, the used are there to be enjoyed by emo people and heavy metals, not by [people] who wear slipknot hoddies to look hip. This CD is great, you'll love every song, You'll want more, You'll be listening to them for at least the next 6 months after buying this CD, you'll want to see them live ( im going to see them live in 3 days time, all ive heard is they are great live) and you'll tell all your friends about them, they will buy the CD, they will love them, and at the end of this cycle The Used will become known as, what is Blink 182. yes you'll see them making songs with britney and you'll be upset, very upset. All i can say is thank god the world created Thursday and Glassjaw who are not so publicised as these guys are. <BR>Im starting to get upset writting this review now as i can feel the sickness in my stomach that my favourite band is going to be sucked in to the Pop/Punk genre. All i have to say is buy the album, enjoy it while it lasts and hope it does last that the used are emo and not pop/punk. I cant wait to see these live, this girl and Through silence are gonna be there, yes both of these are like the used so buy their CD's too!! I leave now with my words of wisdom that pop is pop and emo is emo, that means leave them how they are and dont try to mix them. its not cool or hip, it just ruins music and ruins my life. thank you for reading and o yeh, i cause i havnt said, best album ever, buy it, buy it now, you wont be sorry and buy Thursday - Full Collapse and GlassJaw - Worship and Tribute....and GlassJaw's first album is also a different gravy.
0790729636|4.0|It says right on the cover of the DVD that Twister is a project from the producers of \\"Jurassic Park\\", which is fitting considering that the only difference between that movie and \\"Twister\\" is that the dinosaurs are replaced with tornadoes.  Oh, and this movie has a flying cow that just might put a smile on your face.<br />This is the story of two scientists named Bill and JoAnne Harding, played by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, respectively.  They were once married to each other, but now in the process of divorcing.  Bill and his new fiancé, Melissa (Jami Gertz), go to see JoAnne to pick up the legal documents that will finalize their divorce.  While they're with JoAnne and her research crew they get news of some tornado activity in the vicinity.   Bill and JoAnne had devised this machine called the \\"Dorothy\\" which was supposed to help measure the intensity inside the middle of a tornado, and they figure that these tornados will give them a chance to see if their machine actually works.  The next thing you know, everybody is chasing after and running away from tornados, all in an effort to test out their machine, as well as compete against a \\"rival\\" group of scientists who have copied the machine's design and created a similar device of their own.   <br />There's also a subplot involving the budding love triangle between Bill, JoAnne, and Melissa.  Though they're divorcing, Bill and JoAnne still have deep feelings for each other, much to the chagrin of Melissa.  However, in relation to the grand scheme of this movie, this subplot is awkward and simply doesn't work.  The audience is made to believe that this group of scientists is risking their lives in pursuit of a scientific breakthrough.  It seems silly for Melissa to be questioning the feelings that her fiancé might have for his ex-wife.  <br />Just as in \\"Jurassic Park\\", the story line of this movie is pretty weak.  The only reason to see the movie is for its outstanding visual effects.  This is a movie that would be fun to see on a big screen TV.  I'm disappointed that I didn't go see it when it first came out in theaters.  While the plot is [simple], the cinematography, art direction, and special effects more than make up for it.  I recommend this movie.
0385503954|5.0|This book does start off slow,but don't be put off by that. Just stick with it as it evolves into an intriguing,multi-layered story about a young girl with a very over-active imagination and the tragic results it causes within her family. Each section of the story has it's own special tone,from the leisurely lifestyle of pre-war 2 England,to the tragedy of the war itself and the aftermath of young Briony's actions still reverberating years later. An expertly told story by a very talented writer.
B00000JCY0|5.0|The earlier reviewers of this album are on the ball as this album is truly great and was constructed with incredible precision.<BR>Its brilliance has not gone completely unnoticed either. To the music, and the track 'Sweet F.A. is a super heavy rock song with a super beat and a great groaning guitar solo to finish off. Truly one of the great rock songs in my view. Set me Free is similarly good in this mode with lots of crunching chords and guitar runs. Rebel Rouser is a more commercial effort but still has a heavy rock base to it. Then there's the beautiful \\"Heartbreak Today\\", a lovely mix of harmonies and melodic guitar. \\"Into the Night\\" and \\"Restless\\" are more laid back, but still with lots of good drum and guitar work.<BR>Probably the best thing about this album is the professional way the musicians work together. They are all completely in sync with each other. Mick Tucker's drumming is as tight as the drums he used. Steve Priest's base keeps and changes the rhythm like a clock, Andy Scott's guitar work makes it what it is and Brian Connolly's vocals have a richness of tone yet he is still more than capable of singing the hard stuff.<BR>Then there's the harmonies. >One of the beauties of the band was they were able to produce great albums that were so different. \\"Off the Record\\" and Give us a Wink\\" are substantively different from this album yet masterpieces in their own right. There is no doubt in my mind that Sweet Fanny Adams is one of the great Sweet albums and one of the great albums full stop.  Its also probably one of the most accessible albums the Sweet produced. I would therefore recommend that those considering the purchase of a Sweet album buy this one first. If you love it as much myself and all the other reviewers here, then I suggest you buy most if not all the other Sweet albums as well.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|The movie is in wide screen format and millions of people have to squint the eyes to view the movie on TV sets that do not accomodate wide screen.  They need a duel layer disk so all customers can enjoy the movie.  Don't buy any wide screen movie for a standard TV set.
B00005TT77|5.0|I had fallen away from the Beatles music, but this soundtrack drew me back in.  Although I had spent some time listening to other genres and styles of music, this soundtrack reminded me of how much I really did love the Beatles...  And still do.  I must say that among these renditions of the great Beatles hits the Eddie Vedder (Hide Your Love Away), Black Crowes (Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds), Sarah McLaughlan (Blackbird), Sheryl Crow (Mother Nature's Son), and suprisingly Aimee Mann and Michael Penn's (Two of Us) performances were AMAZING.  Although nothing will ever be as good as the original, once you've seen the movie you gain a very deep appreciation for this soundtrack.  Once you've seen the movie you really learn to love Rufus Wainwright's version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; you can even hear in the back of your head Lucy trying to convince herself that &quot;nothing's gonna change my world.&quot;  And also, in the tender moment with Lucy and Sam on the bus, when Lucy is running away from the social worker, &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; (One of my favorite Beatles songs by far) by Ben Harper adds a very soft sound to that moment.  This is overall a great soundtrack.  Don't let any of these negative criticisms on here deter you from buying this one.  It's a keeper.
B00004VVNB|4.0|Ok.  This is not really a fair review.  I have been weaned on this movie since I was very young.  I would always catch the end or bits and bobs on TV for years and years.  Not util I got the DVD did I see the film for the first time.  Shockingly dated, bad special effects and it is very slow in a lot of points.  But it does tell a story.  One could, if they wished, say that this is a parable for the &quot;ME&quot; generation.  How life is over once your 30.  How live is about the searching for pleasure.  How one person beings to see that life does not end at 30....bla bla bla.  But it's just a movie and a fun one.  If you could imagine a future designed by the same person who designed all those 70's discos, this is what it would look like.

0790732254|5.0|One night late after a dinner party a quarrelling couple, the washed-out History professor George (Richard Burton) and his bitter alcoholic wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), is about to receive guests.  When the guests, the new Biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis), arrive they find the hosts mocking each other in overt malicious intent.  This makes the guests very uncomfortable, but the awkward feeling is drowned in alcohol and further sarcasm.  Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is an emotional drama that provides an uncomfortably good performance that will stun the audience.
B00004R997|2.0|This was my first review at amazon.com back in 2003. It was a pretty bad, although accurate, conveyance of my feelings for this film. But I really didn't capture the essence of what this film meant to me. So now I am doing a total re-write. No, I did not delete it and write a new review. I earned a lot of negative votes and I intend to keep them. However, my mind has not changed. This is not a film you will enjoy with the kids, at least not all of it. I tend to write in bullet statements (because it's easier/faster than being a good writer), so here in bullet form is my new and improved review of \\"Saludos Amigos\\".<br /><br />-You've probably read about how this really should not qualify as a \\"feature\\" film because it's so short. THANK GOD!!! Some of this is so bad and SOOOO BORING that the short length is merciful.<br /><br />-There are 4 cartoons loosely enveloped in Walt's home movies of him and his crew \\"researching\\" south of the border. I said home movies because this footage is SO BORING! You really must be a Disney geek to enjoy this stuff. OH LOOK! IT'S OLLIE JOHNSTON RIDING A HORSE!!! Did I say \\"BORING\\"?<br /><br />-The 4 cartoons are actually pretty good, but you have to work around those BORING home movies to view them. I son't want to spend time telling you what they are (That's been done) so read the amazon synopsis. However, these \\"toons\\" do not justify owning this DVD. The rest of the movie is SO BORING that this really should only cost Ten Bucks, at most, unless, of course, you are a huge Disney nut in which case you should buy everything he's done including \\"Song of the South\\" which I think you can get on bootleg in China.<br /><br />-If you don't believe me then just ask my family. That title above is an actual quote from my daughter when she was 5 years old. She was BORED OUT OF HER MIND! My wife said \\"Can we skip this BORING stuff?\\" Now mind you, she was speaking of the \\"educational\\" stuff (home movies) about the Southern Hemisphere. SHE'S A FREAKING TEACHER!!!<br /><br />-Did I mention that most of this is really BORING?  Just checking.<br /><br />Well, that was easier than I thought. Obviously I found everything that was not a cartoon in this boring.  It's a shame really.  The Southern Hemisphere really got gypped due to poor production values and boring choice of subject matter.

0312305060|4.0|Michael Cunningham has captured the spirit of three very different women.  Even though we only get a glimpse of one day out of a lifetime, Cunningham is able to show the strentgh and integrity that each character shows in times of crisis, loss, or sadness.  <BR>The three women are Virginia Woolf, Laura Brown, and Clarissa Vaughn.  Virginia has to deal with a life full of dead pan headahces and voices that won't leave her in peace.  She has a semi droll existence in a suburb od England and she dreams of going back to the city.  She wants to explore.  Virginia is in the process of writing her masterpiece, Mrs. Dalloway, on this day of days.  She has a visit from her sister in which a death is experienced.  Virginia wishes she could lay in the place of the bird her niece and nephews have created a funeral pyre for.  <br />Laura Brown is a Los Angeles housewife in the 1950's.  She is pregnant with her second child, and it is her husbands birthday.  The husband that she married not because she \\"loved\\" him, but because he was a good man and he was strong.  Laura uses books to escape from her unhappiness.  The frivolity of life sends her to a motel to get away from the child that always seems aware of her and the cake with the crumbs in the icing.  Her current escape is Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, which she reads in the hotel room that would be a perfect place to die alone.<br />The third woman is Clarissa Vaughan.  Clarissa is planning a party in honor of a friend dying of AIDS who has won a literary award for his astonishing poerty.  Clarissa is what one would call a modern day Mrs. Dalloway, they even share the same first name.  She spends the day flitting around trying to make things perfect for her party, including moving a flower vase 5 times.  <br />The hours is a look at how droll life can be if you allow it to be.  Each woman will inspire as well depress the soul, and make you question what is important in life.
0312305060|5.0|how amazing is this book. i'm so glad i was never tempted to read the last chapter before it was due...and what an ending the book has!!! <BR>the book definitely deserved the Pulitzer. I am vowing NOT to see the film - i know it will only destroy the sheer beauty of this work. that's how good this book is.
0441003257|5.0|This is a great book.  It is witty and intelligent.  I've bought many copies of this book and given them out as &quot;presents&quot; because once you loan it to a friend they don't want to give it back.<br />I only wish they made this book in a hardcover!
B000021Y77|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie. I first saw this on the Bravo channel and was intrigued by the concept. I rented it and fell in love with this movie. The actors Franka Potente and Moritz Blietzbleu(I cannot spell today) were so human in their emotions and motivation. This movie was extremely refreshing in comparison to all but a few American movies today. I loved all of the characters in this movie and the idea and reality of someone's fate being affected by time and the smallest actions of others is genius of the director. This film is a landmark in all modern cinema. <BR>   Also Reccomended: La Femme Nikita, The Professional, <BR>   Die Another Day
B00006V9A0|2.0|I guess it was only a matter of time before Nirvana came to be viewed as classic rock.  Another band who changed the face of rock confined to a collection of radio \\"hits\\" and pop singalongs.  The problem is, Nirvana didn't really fit into that category prior to Cobain's death.  <BR>Kurt Cobain did not write radio songs.  The art of Nirvana was an uninhibited art of self expression, an unyielding and uncompromising personal exorcism of the bands emotions, blown up into Widescreen digital surround sound.  The screams were real, the drums savage, and the bass intensely heavy.  Nirvana succeeded in bringing the unabashed intensity of punk rock into a more accessable and universal stage, due to Cobain's brilliant songwriting and the band's tight sound.  On In Utero they proved that loud punk rock could still sound good; sublimely good.  Their musical style was influenced by the unconventional sounds of bands like Sonic Youth, developing in an insular way.  <BR>So why should I complain about a collection of some great songs by a great band?  Maybe I feel that this release trivializes the importance of this band.  Maybe i feel that hearing a Nirvana throw away (You Know You're Right) canonized on modern radio among the countless hordes of bands like Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd is just missing the point.  Nirvana was imperfectly wonderful, and their albums are testaments to what a good band is capable of accomplishing.  They were not meant to be heard as an marketing hit machine.  Smells like Teen Spirit was meant to be heard on the same album as Polly and Territorial Pissings, Heart Shaped Box should be heard next to Frances Farmer and Very Ape.  <BR>Please buy the albums, and find out what Nirvana really feels like.
0316666343|5.0|i seriously loved this book.  it was extremely moving and a really heatbreaking story. it seriously made me think of life differantly and i realized that death is much bigger than it seems. i recommend this book to people ages 15 + probably because as a 15 year old myself a lot of the people i know wouldnt be able to handle the book at my age.  i recommend the lovely bones to anyone who can handle a serious freaky heartbreaking book!!!!!!!!!
0553801511|5.0|Is this the fifth book of six, or the eighth of nine?  Hard to say, but not since Cheryh's Chanur series has there been anything this good.  The world is rich, consistent, and deeply imagined.  The characters, too, are very well drawn, convincing and satisfying.  Believable people reponding in believable ways to difficult situations.  No paragons of genius and virtue in set-piece dramas here.<br />If you this is the first of Hobb's you have looked at, I urge you read the Farseer Trilogy first.  All her eight set on this world are first-rate and are best taken in order.
0060536969|3.0|This refers to the unabridged Audio book. The premise is great. The research and tech updates are first rate, thorough and easy to follow. The story dissapoints with literally too much action packed into too few days for any believability. One hair raising escape after another. The lead character, a middle aged, Mr Mom, out of work programmer with three small children who doesn't exercise has no less than 6 death defying escapes from the nano's and their henchmen in one day - each causing wounds, bruising, etc... he just keeps on going. The reader's style is slow and tired - I guess because he's dictating all this first person the night of the final day. The tapes have way too many 10-15 second pauses that are irritating. I've read or listened to everything Crichton has published. This is not his best work... it could have been.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Having seen the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, I was eager to see how the American-ized version of \\"Insomnia\\" would play out.  Without delving too far into the comparisons that have been thoroughly detailed in prior reviews, I will say that this is one of the finer examples of how to film a remake.  <br />This version of \\"Insomnia\\" takes place in a remote Alaskan port city, and revolves around the murder of a young girl.  However, as the movie unfolds, the murder slowly becomes only a small piece of a much more expansive, provoking, intense character drama.  <br />From a cinematographical perspective, the haunting beauty of Alaska is captured perfectly.  In a way unique when compared to other films, the landscape is intertwined with the plot, further exposing the loneliness and isolation, while paradoxically highlighting its stark contrast with murder, death, and psychological demons.  The sequence of the hunt/shooting amidst a thick, impenetrable fog is riveting and conveys a high level of tension, as the viewer shares in the disorientation the fog creates. <br />\\"Insomnia\\" is driven by characters and acting, and a strong cast is assembled.  Al Pacino - as expected - is wonderful in his portrayal of the world-weary city cop who escapes an Internal Affairs investigation by coming to investigate this murder.  In many ways, we have seen Mr. Pacino in this role on numerous occasion, and he demonstrates this with the comfortable ease in which he carries his role.  However, as his sleep-deprivation - caused by the long hours of daylight - intensifies, Mr. Pacino takes his character to a remarkable next level, as he battles to cover his questionable investigative practices and battle the psychological demons tied to similar practices in cases being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles.  As a viewer, you can empathize with his character, while at the same time watch in amazement as he struggles to keep himself from completely unraveling. <br />RobinWilliams is equally strong as the author-turned-murderer.  Like Mr. Pacino, we have seen Mr. Williams in roles similar to this, and yet he is so good at pulling it off that you couldn't see any other person carrying such a role.  His quiet, brooding character is psychologically scary; one senses that a violent, psychotic rage is bubbling just beneath his placid exterior.  Also, Mr. Williams uses his comedic facial reactions to maximize the creepiness of his character.  A couple of times he flashes a muted smile that subtly conveys the twisted pleasure he has in his cat-and-mouse game with Mr. Pacino's character.  He is subdued, but brilliant, in this role. <br />Hilary Swank also shines as the young, impressionable cop who ultimately uncovers Mr. Pacino's attempts to cover up the accidental shooting of his partner.  She wonderfully evolves from one overcome with \\"hero-worship\\" in working with Mr. Pacino's character to one disheartened and mildly angry when she finds that her \\"idol\\" isn't who he is cracked up to be.  Ms. Swank more than adequately holds her own in sharing the screen with Mr. Pacino and Mr. Williams, which is no small feat. <br />The climatic ending to the film is perhaps slightly cliched in its quick tying up of loose storylines, but it plays well here.  In its progression, you weren't quite sure how things were going to be resolved after the teenage suspect is arrested (falsely) for murder.  One would almost have the sense that the movie could have ended with several loose ends hanging, allowing the viewer to ponder the outcome.  But, there was instead the dramatic shootout, which ultimately was a satisfying resolution and conclusion to the film.<br />All told, \\"Insomnia\\" was a very solid, quiet, tense drama that is worth the time to see.  I give it a four-star rating, and recommend it to anyone seeking a good character-driven movie that is free of overwhelming special effects and action sequences.  People seeking a fast-paced drama might want to steer clear, as they might find the pacing of this film to be too slow for their tastes.
0440180295|4.0|This is the second Vonnegut book I've read, the first being The Sirens of Titan.  Sirens disappointed me overall mainly because it sorely lacked a compelling plot.  S5 in my opinion is superior to Sirens in every way.  Vonnegut delivers a strong message about the senselessness of war by narrating the story of Billy Pilgrim.  Pilgrim is a generally clueless American who takes part in the final offensive actions against Germany in World War 2.  In a POW camp in Dresden he survives the fire-bombing of the city which stupefies him further.  He learns new perspectives on time from aliens who abduct him for no apparent reason.  Vonnegut never makes clear whether the science fiction elements of the novel (aliens, time travel) are all in Billy's mind or if they really happened.  The title page states that schizophrenia is involved, so Billy may simply be re-living his memories instead of actually traveling back in time.  And perhaps he's imagining the aliens.  If you saw the recent movie A Beautiful Mind about the brilliant but schizophrenic mathematician John Nash, you'll be able to relate a bit better to poor Billy.<br />Anyhow, the strange structure of the novel works well for its purpose, which is to convince you that modern warfare has little to do with honor and glory.  A great number of soldiers who fight and die for their country are basically kids of high school age or a bit older.  That's bad enough.  But when thousands of civilians are killed senselessly in order to encourage a country to surrender, the whole thing becomes meaningless.  Vonnegut's satiric style fits this theme like hand and glove.  Characterization isn't too great but the humorous and witty dialogue makes up for it.  The novel moves quickly and is somewhat difficult to put down.  Some sex and quite a bit of violence.<br />Not quite as grand as Joseph Heller's brilliant Catch-22, but shorter and easier to digest.  Recommended!
B00005YTFG|5.0|\\"Moulin Rouge\\", produced, written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, is a tragic love story that encompasses the beliefs of the twentieth century Bohemian revolution. With popular works, such as the 1996 production of \\"Romeo &amp; Juliet\\" under his belt, Luhrmann has grown artistically and once again used his unique style of popularizing primitive works to illuminate this story. With remarkable detail, choreography, and up beat renditions of popular music, Baz Luhrmann has once again has left his fans satisfied with his new production and eagerly awaiting his next masterpiece.<BR> The story of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is set in Montmartre, Paris around the turn of the twentieth century. As the Moulin Rouge is a nightclub for gentlemen, it is also a brothel that revolves around the main character Satine (Nicole Kidman) who is the \\"Sparkling Diamond\\" of the whole production. Satine, apart of an elaborate plot to entice a Duke to invest in the decadent nightclub, accidentally falls in love with the handsome bohemian artist Christian (Ewan McGregor), who writes the theatrical production \\"Spectacular, Spectacular\\" for Moulin Rouge, who also narrates the story. Satine and Christian become encased in each other and are faced by the challenge of keeping their affair hidden from everybody; which tragically sparks explosive consequences. The two also add unique flair and spirit to the movie through they're amazing vocal abilities that reach out into the audience and grab their attention.<BR> Throughout the whole film there are many renditions of popular songs that contribute to the movie's notability; the variety includes many songs, ranging from \\"Roxanne\\" by Sting to \\"I Will Always Love You\\" by Whitney Houston. In including elaborate amounts of pop culture, it ultimately reflects the involvement of Luhrmann who regularly popularizes and or modifies older artistic works. The music in this movie will capture the audience and almost force them to sing along, as the aura created by the soundtrack of this film is one of complete glee. Contrasting with the heart wrenching story line of the film, the soundtrack is very well comprised and illuminates the amazing detail in every aspect of this film.<BR> As the movie begins, the audience will be bewildered by the strong effects and immaculate detail, which will play a very important role in the identity of this movie. If you have happened to stumble upon the Luhrmann version of \\"Romeo &amp; Juliet\\" you will recognize the director's rare style which prevails through obsessive detail in absolutely everything. This happens to be highly evident with in \\"Moulin Rouge\\", down to the last bit of lace on the can-can skirts to the sparks when Satine and Christian kiss for the first time, Mr. Luhrmann has out done himself obsessing over every tiny detail once again.<BR>       From the gifted producer Baz Luhrmann, \\"Moulin Rouge\\", a tragic love story about a courtesan and a bohemian artist, is truly a piece of art. In my opinion, it should be shelved in the rental store along side the renowned musicals such as, \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"Grease\\", \\"The Little Shop of Horrors\\", and \\"West Side Story\\", as I believe it will be considered a classic musical in future generations. With the combination of its dazzling artistic and articulate detail, a mind-blowing soundtrack, a brilliant story line, perfectly selected cast, amazing choreography, and an overall sparkling aura, this movie truly can be called \\"spectacular spectacular.\\"
B00005B6C9|5.0|The brothers Gibb (better known as the Bee Gees) have been producing and recording quality music for nearly forty years. Through the decades, they have managed to reinvent their style, whilst all the time keeping their high-caliber sound intact. I am a fan of all of their incarnations; strummy, short-length sixties crooners: flashy, infectious, thumpy disco sirens: and warm, glowing, harmonious balladeers. Their 2001 LP finds the group not missing a single beat.<br />&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; starts out with the catchy title song. It is a simple track, recorded live with real instruments, and the hook is simply marvelous, with Robin Gibb's high, fragile voice swelling up, only to fall into harmony with the sublime voices of his brothers, Maurice and Barry.<br />The second song on the album, &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; does a good job evoking the style of the early Beatles' recordings. It's definitely one to sing-a-long to, and quite a head shaker, as well! Track three is the warm and affectionate &quot;Sacred Trust&quot;. This is the song that, when I heard the brothers perform it live on television, made me decide to purchase the album the very next day. It features soothing lead vocals by Barry Gibb.<br />The late Maurice Gibb takes lead vocals on &quot;Man In the Middle&quot;, a song about weariness, despair, and love. It is one of the many stand-outs on the album. My other favorite on the disc is &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, another song that sounds like it came straight out of the sixties. It is short, sweet, to the point, and will be sure to put a smile on your face.<br />I have mentioned my favorite tracks off of &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;, but the entire album is wonderful. The Bee Gees really offer such great music with each and every one of their releases. They are talented, consistent, and a serene pleasure to listen to. This album carries on that reputation most admirably.

B00005JKMQ|4.0|Will Smith and Michael Mann take on Muhammed Ali with maximum perfection. The movie never fails. It tells the story of the rise of the greatest athlete that ever lived into the boxing world, his victories in both the Rumble In The Jungle and Thrilla In Manilla, his funny confrontations with Howard Cosell, who is remarkably impersonated and portayed by Jon Voight, and his many wives, which Ali refers to as a &quot;weakness towards women&quot;. <br />The only weakness about this DVD is the extra features segment...there are no features! I sure would have liked to see a behind the scenes segment, or an interview with Will or Ali himself with their thoughts regarding the movie. The music video by R Kelly would have also been nice to have here. But the film which is almost 3 hours is a great viewing experience.<br />With one star off the rating for an empty DVD, Ali is the one of the strongest films out there today. <br />I'd highly recommend the special edition DVD that I hope Columbia Pictures is planning to release soon.<br />But until then, this DVD version is a must-have!
B00006AFUR|5.0|From Capricorn to Year Zero, this album is solid, every song is great.  One of those cd's you can just listen to all the way through over and over again. Great stuff.
B0000639FE|5.0|Every once in a while, a movie comes along that lifts the spirits, gives you a smile, and makes going to the movies a great experience all over again. <BR>Cameron Crowe, of \\"Say Anything\\" fame, succeeds in bringing to life an everyday man struggling with everyday problems of the everyday common man. This particular common man is a sports agent, a very successful and, of course, rich agent who has a stunningly attractive fiance, athletes who depend on him to make fortunes, and friends who admirably and openly tell him \\"I love you, Jerry!\\". Jerry Maguire is his name. And he is played brilliantly by the ever-so-loved Tom Cruise. Despite all the love around him, however, Jerry does one mistake. It comes in the form of a mission statement where he challenges the business and dares to open up and speak out. The friends at the firm give him an expiration date, \\"about two weeks!\\", and it's up to his one time protegee Jay Mohr to tell him that he's fired in one of the most classic moments in movie history, sitting in a restaurant surrounded by a crowd of people (the scene where Tom Cruise stares down at his glass of water after Mohr blurts out 'I'm here to let you go' is as real as reality goes). Jerry is left struggling and failing to keep his clients except for one, the obnoxious Football player Rod Tidwell (played even more brilliantly by Cuba Gooding Jnr) His fiance leaves him labeling him a 'loser' and he finds himself battling to survive with the loudmouthed client and a single mother secretary, who quits the firm for him, who is the only left admirer of his 'memo'! <br />Crowe, who writes and directs this movie, takes care of the characters' progress throughout the entirety of the movie. Jerry and the secretary (played by the sweet Renee Zellweger) slowly and passionately start to fall in love, and the relationship between Jerry and her only son grows from a goofy friendship into a father-son type of relation. But best of all is Jerry's one on one dialogue with Rod. Jerry can't stand the fact that he's stuck with Rod but faces the fact that he's his only hope left, and Rod still believes in Jerry and more or less becomes his right shoulder and gains him confidence. Like any other everyday man, Jerry still has people around telling him how great he is, even though he thinks very lowly of himself. This is the same theme throughout most of Crowes' films, especially \\"Say Anything\\" where John Cusack's character finds confidence through Lili Taylor. <BR>The movie is funny. With serious drama flowing thoughout. And there are catch phrases that people everywhere quote, most commonly \\"show me the money!\\"<br />The DVD features two discs with loads of special features, deleted scenes, rehearsals, and the music video of Bruce Springsteen's 'Secret Garden'.<br />Highly recommended!
B00005HYHA|5.0|This is the definitive version of this great album.  All the inserts in here also came with the original lp.  2 posters and 2 stickers.  You also get the A and B side labels from the original lp.  Very cool!  This cd has a little extra bass, which I like, and the sound quality is perfect.  If you don't have this album on cd already, this is the only way to go.  If you have it already on cd, upgrade to this one!
B00005V1Z0|1.0|I never expected this to be a masterpiece of cinematography, but, my god, this was unbelievably bad, from beginning to end.<BR> <BR>Good things first: Angelina Jolie is hot.<br />Bad things: everything else.<BR>I mean, it's okay if a movie doesn't have a decent story if the rest is entertaining, even it's stupid and unrealistic (see \\"The Mummy\\").<BR>Tomb Raider, however, lacks everything a movie should have. <BR>It's not entertaining, only boring and inane to the maximum. <BR>Now, to the bad things:<br />First, the \\"story\\": One gigantic hot air balloon, mixing esoteric mumbo-jumbo with Illuminati conspiracies, Jolie ... , pseudoarcheology and Jolie... .... Confusing and no meaning whatsoever.<br />Then, the special effects: Somehow everything looks unreal, like made out of plastic, even the \\"real\\" stuff like Jolie's mansion. Go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark, they did a better job 20 years ago.<br />Characters? Who needs characters when you've got ...  explosions and gunfire every 10 seconds? So, there's absolutely no problem in introducing a female,good looking, superwealthy, highly intelligent female ex-special forces member that studied archaeology and can read or speak almost every language fluently. She always knows what to do, what to say, how to defeat 10 armed commandos without guns, everything.<BR>Not even slightly unrealistic.<br />This is easily the worst movie ever made. Hysterical, unnecessarily fast paced, and so inane it makes \\"The Mummy\\" look like a documentary. Avoid it at all cost.
B000001Y2U|3.0|Give this guy credit, he was M & M before there even was an Eminem!! Ha ha!! <br />But I digress...<br />The real credit goes to Interscope for creating a martian out of thin air and making him (and them) a millionaire several times over. <br />Long live rock & roll.
B00005JKGI|2.0|Silly plot, silly performance, silly car chase, silly music and an absolutely silly ending. It deserves 1 star only but I reluctantly give it two stars because of Michael Caine who as usual does a good job.
B000067CPX|5.0|Funky fresh...those are the words I choose to describe the Peppers' latest. Yes, they bring 'da funk to the table here, but they also, for once in their stinkin' careers, decided to bring 'da melody...which makes for a great album.<br />It seems Kiedis & 'da boyz decided to invigorate their tiring formula by instituting Beach Boys-like harmonies to the mix, which works splendidly. <br />It's good that 'da drugz & alcohol ain't affectin' the Peppers like they used to. Now sober, these guys are a harmonic force to be reckoned with....<br />THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE A POPULAR \\"EMO\\" BAND THESE DAYS!<br />HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|An avid fan of Broadway's Chicago and its soundtrack made me wary of the film version's soundtrack.  However, Chicago is amazing.  Catherine Zeta-Jones absolutely shines in her performance as Velma, and her voice fits perfectly.  Zellweger was surprising excellent as Roxie.  The one problem I had was Richard Gere.  The nasal tone of his voice detracts from the music and on &quot;We Both Reached for the Gun&quot;, his Roxie sounds almost too much like his Billy Flynn.  While Gere was a horribly wrong choice for this part, overall the soundtrack is amazing and I love it.  Especially &quot;I Move On&quot;.
B00005YW4H|5.0|In the days were most of the younger singers are intent on hitting screechy high notes that will burst your eardrums or mumbling unintelligable words to a even more unintelligable beat, Nora Jones is a breath of fresh air.  Like the Late Eva Cassidy this young singer has a voice that is mature beyond her years.  The beauty of her songs, both her own and the covers, are increased by her incredible talent for phrasing.  <br />This is a wonderful CD to listen to at work, at home in front of a fire to relax, with a loved one or in the car where no-one cares if you don't have a voice like Nora, because you just can't help trying to sing along.<br />You'll be humming these haunting tunes for days.
B00005OAIE|1.0|The album is squarer than the title.. The songs sound the same. and all have the same boring beat..  It is so boring. I will not even try and sell it. I am throwing it out!!
B00003CXSP|1.0|The massive popularity of this repugnant film has revealed to me that society is deeply sick and there is no hope for it. That the average human being I pass on the street is in reality, underneath the flimsy cloak of civility, a closet sadist who takes pleasure in seeing others being mutilated. For all our belief that we are more progressive than our ancestors this is exposed to be a lie. The crowd sitting in the auditorium enjoying watching a man being disemboweled is no better than a crowd 500 years ago eagerly watching someone being burned at the stake, or hung-drawn-and-quartered.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Not by any means an album to compare with U2's more popular/respected musical achievements over the decades. Any event, 5-6 memorable songs definitely make this CD not anything to pass up. Discotheque, Gone, Staring At The Sun, Last Night On Earth (better having deserved a greatest hit inclusion) and ?If God Will Send His Angels, Please? all classify this effort a good attempt making available quality tracks. Although other (songs) tend to repeat their format, fans must remember until this time U2 had done little if any experimenting with the techno-production process. Along with similar rock bands, today's digi-pop wouldn't have been an easy transition to tour with saying the least. If you own this CD (or not), you may recently have noticed U2's Best Of 1990-2000 only offers re-mixes of its few chosen tracks. These I feel should best have been left alone. For that reason in particular, would avoid ever swapping this disc at any used CD store for some spare change alternative (fallen for that convenience/regret enough times personally) - then again, I love third-party advice no more than you.
B000021Y77|4.0|Run Lola Run is the result of a great experiment in film. Despite little characterization, scattered dialogue and a very basic plot, it fully succeeds in its intentions.<br />The simplistic plot concerns Lola receiving a phone call from her boyfriend Mannie, who has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 deutsch marks or faith the wrath of a crime boss. Lola sets off to find a way to come up with the money before Mannie resorts to robbery. That's it. But the trick of the film lies in the retelling of those 20 minutes in three separate scenarios as Lola is given multiple chances to get things right.<br />But the filmmakers don't need a second chance to get this film right. The pulsating techno soundtrack perfectly connects with the beautiful images of Lola running, trying to beat destiny. There's just something about the urgency in her eyes and the gracefulness with which she runs that won't let you take your eyes away from her. The film also explores how extremely minor events, such as brushing against someone, can have profound impacts on the rest of a person's life.<br />There's really not a whole lot more I can say about Run Lola Run. It's just a very small, short film (an 80 minute running time) that perfectly captures its subject. This one is definitely recommended, even for those that normally may avoid foreign language films. You just can't miss out on it.
0141301104|5.0|This book does not pretend to be representing the Pagan religion.  It is not showing \\"witches\\" in the modern religious sense, but rather as the witches of the old traditional sense.  If you are to complain about this book, you might as well complain against Macbeth, Wizard of Oz, and the entirety of Halloween.  This is not political correctness, it is just an excuse for some people to complain.
6305842442|5.0|First of all, everything you have heard about the director's cut being the better version is TRUE! The folks that view the older version as anything more than a curiosity, are the same people that hate widescreen movies because they cut off the top and bottom of the picture. <BR>Scott did the film world a favor in going back to re-cut a once flawed masterpiece. Excising the atrocious &quot;let's explain everything to the audience&quot; voice-over, and the tagged on audience pleaser ending (culled from Kubrick's unused helicopter footage from &quot;The Shining&quot;), brings the true majesty of the film to the forefront.<BR>Every frame is filled with eye candy, back when eye candy required ingenuity to be realistic, and is staged with such precision that one cannot be unimpressed with an imagination that has been copied and emulated but never surpassed.
B00005YXZH|5.0|At least the critics got it right on this one, even though the Grammys and the record company didn't.  This is a CD that almost didn't get released, until Wilco bought it back from their former label and shopped it around.  It's a brilliant CD whose style is hard to define... alternative-country-pop-folk.  &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; is incredibly catchy, and &quot;Jesus, etc.&quot; is my pick for best song of the year... the song still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.  Clearly, this CD is one of the best of 2002.
0060506989|5.0|This book is a stunning accomplishment written by the on scene American commander of the first major combat engagement in VietNam in late 1965 at the Ia Drang Valley.  It threads the line masterfully between human interest story and gripping actual war story.  It is quick to read, but also remarkably detailed.  It is not a \\"literary\\" masterpiece, but it is in no way a \\"dumbed down\\" book.  <br />This 560 page paperback tells the story of the formation and first time use of what would become a standard image of the war in VietNam, Air Assault by helicopter.  The book opens with a number of pages telling how portions of the 1st Cavalry Division were being converted by technology and need from old style mobile ground infantry into highly mobile, helicopter-bourne shock troops for use in the hostile territory and hostile terrain of the growing conflict in South East Asia.  We follow many of the participants from their training in the United States over to deployment \\"on the cheap\\" in South VietNam.  Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore was the battalion commander and Joe Galloway was the UPI reporter who found themselves dropped right into a massive hornet's nest of eager for battle North Vietnamese Army regulars massively outnumbering the Americans at Landing Zone X-Ray.  The details of the battle from BOTH SIDES are described in vivid detail giving the reader a harrowing image of the horror that combat actually is.  The main battle rages on day and night for a couple days as every bit of the new training and tactics taught to the battalion are put to desperate use.  New tactics are developed on the spot as American soldiers frantically fight to save themselves and their buddies.  The history of the embattled unit (the 7th Cavalry of General Custer's last stand at Little Big Horn) weighs heavily on the Americans as they fight to prevent being overrun again nearly 90 years later half-way around the world.  The value of Hal Moore's excellent leadership during the X-Ray battle isvividly illustrated later when poor leadership gets the unit's sister battalion decimated nearby at Landing Zone Albany.<br />This book is well worth reading even to the casual reader.  It is not a \\"flag-waver\\" or an anti-war book.  It simply tells the true story of relatively ordinary humans who find themselves mixed up in \\"a new kind of war\\" that seems destined to get all of them killed brutally.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is expertly presented and researched.  Many of the American survivors of the battle meet each year in remembrance and the authors have used these gatherings to make sure they got the details and full stories right.  The authors also met the North Vietnamese commander of the battle at length when writing this book who gave them fine insight into the perspective from the \\"other side\\".  You can smell the sweat, and the fear, everywhere.<br />This book is not to be missed by any human being who wants to understand (and hopefully avoid) what war is like.  It is sobering and very much worth your effort.
B000062XGG|2.0|Seven years ago, I remember seeing Independence Day in theaters.  Did it bowl over then?  Kinda.  I remember thinking it was an extremely entertaining time at the movies, but bear in mind, I was all of 11 at the time.  Having seen this movie three times since (yes, I bought it on video the first day it came out, watched it and still liked it, watched it again a year or so after that), I can say clearly the charms have worn off.  Independence is most certainly not a good movie, and while it might make for so-so escapism, there's nothing about it that truly bowls me over.  As a matter of fact, ID4 can't even take the claim for best alien invasion flick of 1996.  Hell, it was the third best of that year (behind Star Trek: First Contact and The Arrival), which is a pretty dubious honor considering alien invasion movies aren't exactly delivered in spades.  <br />I'll dispense with a plot summary, seeing how it is you've (a) probably already seen the movie (b) or have heard about it) or (c) would never watch it on the basis of your complete hatred for anything related to science fiction and/or Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (the last one is perfectly understandable).  All you need to know is that aliens want to take over the Earth and it's up to a raggedy group of humans to fight back.<br />Independence Day has a lot of things going for it: a great premise, energetic action sequences, first-rate special effects, a number of good laughs, and the occasional bit of awe-inspiring visuals.  You might be thinking, isn't that all you need for a successful summer action blockbuster?  Typically, yes, but ID4 has quite a few problems, some even involving the positive aspects I mentioned above, or lack thereof.  <br />The story is the first thing everyone will jump on, and I'll get on the bandwagon with this one; it's true, ID4's script is pretty bad.  Now, the whole virus element in the climax doesn't particularly bother me, considering how it was earlier specifically stated thatEarth's satellites were connected to the ships.  What does bother me is why the ships would actually allow such a lengthy countdown, enough time for a lot of people to escape the blast radius.  Most bothersome plot-wise, is that once the shields are down, the aliens are almost pathetically easy to take down.  When the ships are destroyed, they actually crash slant-wise, thus avoiding a huge crash on the target below them.  Only a fool would actually believe this doesn't somehow defy the laws of physics.  Ugh, and don't even get me started on Randy Quaid's character, his deus ex machina role, and his final lines of dialogue.<br />At this point, I'm a little tired of discussing plot, so we'll get to the action, which ID4 has a surprisingly sparse amount of.  If I recall, we get three in all, the first portraying the destruction of the U.S.'s three major cities, the unsuccessful aerial battle, and finally, the successful aerial battle.  That's really not a lot of action, and considering they're all airborne, the redundancy sets in very quickly.  The film does deliver some thrills, but inconsistently in a movie that runs for nearly two-and-a-half hours.<br />At this point, it feels a little pointless to even write a review on the movie.  Anyone over the age of twelve who wanted to see the movie has probably already seen it.  The critical backlash toward it is unsurprising, that's the case for every Devlin/Emmerich collaboration.  These guys would follow-up with the even worse, Godzilla, which took redundancy to an all-time high, with its incessant rain and never-ending conclusion.  <BR>** 1/2 out of *****
0066214122|3.0|I read this book in 2 days. I REALLY enjoy Michael Crichton's writing because you become so immersed in learning something new every time he writes a book... but this particular plot felt flatter than most.<br />Maybe its because of the tired story of a couple coming apart at the seams, maybe its because of the very rough chapter endings ala &quot;Goosebumps&quot; style... Maybe he was writing in the style of a new movie script?? Seems a lot of authors are doing that these days, &lt;sadly&gt;.<br />In any case, I LOVED learning about nanotechnology and artificial life... but that was about it. Yeah, I'd buy it - wait till the paperback comes out or buy a used one just to learn something new. Don't expect to be brought in with your mind in the plot though, the way previous Crichton novels have seduced you.

B00005JLSC|5.0|Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere star in this highly anticipated remake of the classic Broadway musical.  Let me just say that this is the best musical since \\"Moulin Rouge\\".  I bought the soundtrack before me and a friend of mine went to see it.  We became obsessed with the \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and when we saw it performed on-screen, we were in awe.  I couldn't believe how well it was performed and directed.  Not only that, but this was Rob Marshall's first film and he also did all of the choreography for the dance sequences.  <br />       Like Moulin Rouge, the actors danced and sang without doubles and that is what makes the movie better.  Everyone that participated in this film should be labeled as extremely talented.  Studios should keep bringing on the musicals because for some of us, we can't make it to most broadway shows and this will give people a chance to do so.  Musicals are making a comeback, as Jennifer Connelly said at the Golden Globes \\"why not?\\"  I would give this film 10 stars if I could!!!<br />        Congradulations on winning best film, best actor and best actress Chicago.  I hope you have the same luck at the Oscars.  I can't wait.
1573300403|5.0|This is a great DVD. Mr. Jackson is one of the greatest entertainers in the world. This just shows it to those who do not believe.
0694524786|5.0|Even if you have read this as a kid, you should take the time to read or listen to it again.  You will have an entirely new perspective on it, and the writing style is still engaging.  I plan to keep these CDs around for my kids.
0060934913|4.0|Being a fan of his TV show on the Food TV Network, I hungered for more of Anthony Bourdain's crude wit and harsh tell-it-as-it-is personality.  Kitchen Confidential starts out with pure Bourdain attitude and fed my hunger satisfactorily.  However, the latter half of his tell-all tale of the restaurant biz fell apart with random stories which don't tie together well with the book overall.  Despite the roughness and poor editing of the book, I found it to be an enjoyable read.  Bourdain does a good job telling his self-aggrandizing life story, but leaves out his wife almost entirely!  Given his character, career obsession, and drug use, I'd like to know more about the woman who stands behind him and puts up with his horse [dung].
B00006IS85|4.0|Great flick, but would really like to see Zeta on my Mitsubishi D-VHS player.  Buyers beware: D-Theatre tapes will not play on D-VHS players.  Even your state of the art D-VHS machine can't play D-Theatre tapes unless its got the proprietary JVC D-Theatre chip.  How can D-VHS catch on if there's already a format battle within D-VHS?  Hey movie moguls, it's about the quality of the picture for personal home use (afterall we're paying $1200 for the machine and $40 bucks for each movie) not about making hundreds of copies (you think we could afford the machine if we spent our time making copies?) This is a different Videophile market; research the audiophile market and learn a new trick.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The Coen brothers have a knack for taking a genre and turning it in upon itself. In The Big Lebowski they present 'The Dude' in a fantastic performance of a guy in love with white russians (milk and kaluah) and bowling. His adventures are that of a stoner Ramond Chandler with a truly great and over the top performance by John Goodman as his buddy/partner.<br />The dream sequences are funny, scenes in the film that don't initally make sense are funny. You might not even understand what's going on but there's a light surreal air that makes everything sensible. <BR>This is a great choice for the DVD format as seeing this movie several times reveals more with each viewing. The plot hangs by threads but the situations The Dude experiences and more importantly the way he reacts make for some fantastic comedy.<br />If you need linear stories this might not be your cup of tea but if you enjoy the feel of a film, it's look and overall attitude you'll enjoy The Big Lebowski.<BR>The interview segment of the DVD is excellent as the Coen brothers explain how the film develops and what they were trying to accomplish. But do yourself a favor, watch it a couple of times before playing the interview. See if you got what they were after.<br />The other thing that's great about this film are the number of memorable lines and absurdist situations. The film looks gorgeous and the plot does make sense in it's own little world's set of logic.<br />Jesus, the child molester bowler is a classic. Offensive and funny at the same time.<BR>This is a entertaining film on multiple levels.
0316666343|3.0|I feel that I had read way too much hype about this book prior to reading it, and therefore I expected way to much from this book.  I had also got done reading one of the best book that I have ever read, and was hoping, althought I knew it couldn't beat that book, that it would at least be close, but all in all, I don't think it was up to that level.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good book that would be nice to read just to relax, but I really did not like the ending at all.  Some things were ok, but I think that it really could have been put together better in the end and could have had better outcomes.  I can guaruntee that this is not one of those books that you will struggle though, at over 300 pages I got through it in just two nights of ready very easily.  <BR>  All in all, I do recommend this book, but don't expect it to be the  best thing that you have ever read.
B000065U1N|5.0|A war film that makes very few presumptions and even less moralizing. This is refreshing in light of the horrible mess depicted in this film and depicted in cold colors and dark ambience.<BR>It may seem like the story of a wasted battle and it is. Supplying food and then trying to take apart the corrupt and criminal warlords and their troops (called technicals) you can only wonder why any more lives weren't wasted. 19 American rangers were killed and thousands of Somalians and for what? <BR>The film says it best when an American prisoner is told that politics will not change in Somalia if the warlords are gone, the fighting and killing will go on, it is their way.<br />The realism of battle is compelling if somewhat overly technical at times. The musical score is excellent and not overbearing. Themes are established early on and developed to the sadly logical conclusion.<BR>This is modern warfare that amounts to another miniture Vietnam. Send troops in on a loosely defined mission, micro manage it in Washington while the innocents die.<br />No one wins here, yet the symbolism and metaphors are not smashed into our face. We see the conflict as the participants and leave the film wondering how this sad chapter of history ever happened.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie was much better than the first one. The effects were mind blowing, my favorite was Treebeard. It was worth the wait, and I can't wait till The Return of the King! To sum it all up, this movie rocked!!
0780622553|5.0|The best way I can describe Dark City is ominous. As other reviewers have mentioned it is stylish with Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt turning in excellent performances, Sutherland's portrail as the erie psychiatrist and his pronouncement of being a \\"traitor to his species\\". Start the film off with a bang. <br />The world of Dark City is Fritz Lang's Metropolis meets film noir 40's grit. Although there is not a lot of overt violence the implied violence is truly ugly. In fact everything about Dark City is ugly with the exception of the mysteriously bright and hopeful ads for Shell Beach.<br />The special effects are beautifully rendered with entire city blocks remaking themselves. The spooky gloom of the seeming perpetual night and the hero's quest to find out who and what he is drive the plot.<BR>The premise while promising has some overused science fiction elements. However, this is forgivable in a film that manages to grab your attention even after giving away it's major premise well before the 2nd act.<br />The sets are striking. The existential nihilism is striking. The acting is striking because it is convincing. William Hurt's sad but stoic detective character is nicely played because he is subtle. The main characters do their jobs well to advance the plot. But Kiefer Sutherland steals the film every time he is in a scene. His voice almost otherworldly and ghostly, a choked series of four or five words before gasping for breath. It's some seriously creepy stuff.<br />The downside are the antagonist characters. They are creepy and demented in a typical sci-fi way which is at times brilliant but sometimes hackneyed. Still, they are entertaining and the philosophy behind this Kafkaesque story makes one wonder about what reality is.<br />Despite it's few faults Dark City looks like and quite possibly will be a classic that essays will be written on. Atmospheric, inventive, stylish and sexy but most importantly worth several viewings. <br />One of my favorite films.
0790729725|1.0|Goodfellas is my all-time favorite movie. I could go on and on for days about all of the things that make this movie great. However, the DVD is a disgrace. You actually have to get up in the middle of it and flip it over to watch the rest of the movie! What is that ....?! That is what VHS is for. I was not so bothered by the lack of extra features as I was by this. I would recommend NOT buying Goodfellas on DVD until it is rereleased with it all on one DVD and maybe some extra footage and stuff with it. Geez, you would think a movie of this magnitude would have had more thought put into the DVD.
0375414053|5.0|As a fellow working mother I laughed (and cried) right along with Kate Reddy.  The events and dialogue ring true, and sometimes I thought Allison Pearson had read my mind.  Kate is British, so some references must be figured out by context, but any Anglophile will love this book.  I didn't want this one to end; Kate is now a friend I'd like to receive hilarious emails from.  When's the sequel coming out??
B000002LQR|5.0|BSSM is the only cd ive ever listend to that has 17 songs, and i like every single one. Although their new album By The Way isnt too bad, BSSM stomps it into the ground. All the music blends together in a way ive never heard or probably ever hear again. All I know is I can listen to the whole cd and not complain about a single song. Before BSSM, I listened to Californication like it was no body's business, then I got Blood Sugar, and it totally blew my mind away because of how much better it is than Californication. I cant say enough about this cd and how good it is. If you dont have this cd, you better because the only other of their cd's that compares to one is mother's milk and this one is still a lot better than it. I have OHM, but i just cant listen to it and enjoy it like i do with Blood Sugar. With OHM, i like 3 songs, with Blood Sugar, i like 17, big difference. If I could give this cd more than 5 stars, i would. All I can say is that if youve only heard By The Way and think they [are sub-standard], just get BSSM it will blow your mind with the difference and their ability to blend all the instruments together and all the different sounds that make this album a true masterpiece. I cant tell what my personal favorite songs on this cd are, just that i like every song and cant stop listening to it. And  hopefully if you get this cd, it will change your mind and ideas about what ... good music is...
0066214122|3.0|If your going to try an read this book, I would give it a 2.  But as a book on tape it's a 4.  Why the difference, it's easy I would never read through ALL the explanations of the technilogy, but listening to it on tape requires no thought.  It just sort of flows.<br />Interesting story.  Main character is a bit card board, but in all well worth the LISTENING to.
B00000K19E|5.0|What more can you say?  It's not entirely original material; the basic concept has been explored before.  But it's extremely well done and if you accept the \\"Humans as Coppertop Batteries\\" premise there are no serious plot holes.  My only quibble with the big action fight scene is how when they emptied the weapon they simply dropped it and pulled out another - wouldn't it be easier to carry fewer guns and spare clips?  Another movie in the same vein that I can recommend is Dark City.
B00005JLS0|5.0|There are a lot of romantic comedies made these days. One like another. Boy meets girl, boy looses girl and boy gets the girl back. Very few of them shine above others. Pretty woman was one of them, so was Miss Congeniality (although a slightly different setup for the last one). Two weeks notice is one of the few that shines. Largely dew to very clever writing and excellent performances. <br />Sandra Bullocks brilliant portrayal of a very educated determined and dedicated lawyer combined with her obsessive eating habits will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Scenes of Chinese take out and rush hour bathroom break alone are worth watching even if you ignore the rest of the movie. Combine that with very clever and timely one-liners perfectly delivered by Hugh Grant and you've got an excellent movie. <br />Great chemistry between Sandra and Hugh.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Reign of Fire is a nice little action movie with no gratuitous sex and precious little unnecessary violence.  It doesn't make a lot of sense (ash is what's left after you've extracted all the \\"food value\\" from the item; a dragon that ate ash would starve to death) but it has some good dialog, action sequences, and a subliminal sense of humor.  I gave it an extra star just for the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" play they put on for the orphan children.
B000002MFE|5.0|Clapton plays guitar. His fingers dance across the strings in &#34;Signe,&#34; with the kind of virtuosity fans of his rougher bluesy stuff might not get to hear.<br /><br />Every one of these songs has new life breathed into them. While songs like &#34;Layla&#34; from Clapton's 'Derek and the Dominos' days hardly lacked life, his unplugged versions seem to recreate the songs anew. For as good as the original versions are, Clapton shows, just as Bob Dylan often captures in his concerts, an old classic approached a new way can be a worthy thing.<br /><br />This a CD that is best enjoyed with headphones. Fancy stereo tricks aren't the element of beauty, but careful finger picking in the midst of a tight steel string guitar bring out the notes like salt on an already tasty meal. The whole thing is enhanced when the listener gets a chance to sit down and hear all of it.<br /><br />My personal favorites &#34;Hey Hey&#34; and the contemplative &#34;Tears in Heaven,&#34; but, here at my keyboard late some evening, I'm finding &#34;Nobody Knows When You're Down and Out&#34; makes for great grooving as I write a few reviews. Get down low with &#34;Walkin' Blues&#34; and his slide guitar, and sadder still with &#34;Malted Milk,&#34; a song that pierces the heart until it hurts.<br /><br />&#34;Alberta&#34; is the weakest of the tracks, sounding like he's trying to hard. &#34;San Francisco Bay Blues&#34; is a cool tune, but could've used a little better mixing. He seems to struggle grabbing a couple notes in the difficult, slightly Spanish-and jazz influenced &#34;Old Love&#34; but he pulls it out.<br /><br />The sum of it all is an album that's better with each year. It is among my favorites. I fully recommend &#34;Unplugged&#34; by Eric Clapton.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />AmericanSpeechwriter.com

0452270073|1.0|I wanted to like this book.  I can't say that I didn't try.  But after the first hundred pages or so, I still could not get interested in the book.<br />The basis for the novel is promising:<br />REGENERATION is the story of the English poet, Siegfried Sassoon, and his time spent in an insane asylum during World War I. Sassoon was committed for making a declaration that the war was \\"being deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it\\". His objection to the war was not based on religious or pacifist reasons but because the war had come to a point of being pointless to continue.<br />I kept on waiting for the book to take me somewhere.  It did not.  The novel plods on and on and on with no apparant plot other than Sassoon being in a war hospital for mental patients. There's no suspense, no real storyline, just people being and doing and saying.  The book concerns the case histories of various men in the mental hospital.  However, each of these characters are based on the real stories told in Sassoon's poetry.  So, I suppose that the reason that I had difficulty distinguishing between characters was that their viewpoints were all based on the original viewpoints of the same man: Sassoon.<br />There was only one small storyline in the novel that seemed to be come alive to me -- a small love story of sorts.  However, the love story ended abruptly as if the author got bored with it.<br />This book was recommended to our book club by someone who said that this book had changed her life. So, obviously, some people have truly loved this book. The author even made it into a trilogy. But this bookworm won't be continuing the series . . . even if one of the books in the trilogy did win a Booker award.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I have owned the VHS version of The Mission for several years; can't imagine why it's not on DVD yet. Although it is an attempt to whitewash the devious, evil behavior of the Jesuits in indigenous populations beset by ignorance, it is nevertheless a beautiful work of cinematography; the opening scene is a prime example.  If the rumor of an April 2003 release of a DVD version is credible, I shall be looking forward to acquisition.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|\\"200 km/H In the Wrong Lane\\" is the English translation of t.A.T.u.'s (Taty in Russian) Russian debut of the same name and features nearly all the same songs, this time in poetic English (\\"Ya tvoi vrag\\" would have been a good addition, though, and \\"Doschitai do sta\\" too, they're excellent songs). t.A.T.u is made up of Yulia Olegovna Volkova and Elena Sergeevna Katina, two Russian teenagers with voices of gold and an eye for the dramatic (as witnessed in their controversial Russian music videos).<br />In \\"200 km/h\\" the girls sing about love: unrequited love (\\"Malchik Gay\\"), loving although afraid (\\"All The Things She Said\\"), love and loneliness (\\"Stars,\\" \\"Show Me Love\\"), and escape (\\"Not Gonna Get Us,\\" \\"Stars,\\" \\"30 Minutes\\"). \\"200 km/h\\" is a short collection of eleven songs (one is an extended version and two are in the original Russian, \\"Nas ne dogoniat\\" (\\"Not Gonna Get Us\\") and \\"Ya Soshla S Uma\\" (\\"I've Lost My Mind\\" or \\"All the Things She Said\\") as well as a multimedia track (featuring the video for \\"ATTSS\\" and a short behind-the-scenes featurette with Julie and Lena). The music is bubbly and filled with synths, vocal layering and some haunting sound effects (children laughing in the background, a music box), and the voices of the girls are stunning, light and soaring one minute, practically shouting the next, always translucent and light as air. The lyrics are surprisingly faithful to the Russian originals and some are beautiful turns of phrase that actually contain a message, unlike a good deal of lyrics in bubblegum pop. Here are a few examples:<br />(\\"Stars\\")<br />Are we in love? Do we deserve<br />To bear the shame of this whole world?<br />And like the night we camouflage denial<br />(\\"ATTSS\\")<br />And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed<br />They say it's my fault but I want her so much<br />Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain<br />Come in over my face, wash away all the shame<br />(\\"Show Me Love\\")<br />Tell me how you've never felt<br />Delicate or innocent<br />Do you still have doubts that<br />Us having makes any sense<br />Julie and Lena do an excellent job of singing in English, which was extraordinarily difficult for them but which sounds near-native to me, although some reviewers have commented on their phonetic English. I say hats off to t.A.T.u for introducing the English-speaking world to their phenomenal talent, their daring attitudes ( the girls share a passionate kiss under pouring rain in thin white tops in the \\"All the Things She Said\\" video, all presented in close-up, they frequently kiss in concerts, and most of the songs showcase their love for one another). Is it staged? Is the \\"teenage lesbian\\" theme real, or an exploitation made up by Ivan Shapovalov, t.A.T.u's handler? Who cares? The music is awesome, and whatever their dating status, Julie and Lena pour their hearts and souls into performing and promoting a) being yourself and b) loving who you want. Add to that that now t.A.T.u is a #1 act in a multitude of countries in Europe and also in North America, not too bad for two (girl)friends who are still under twenty. Can't wait to hear the next English album to see how they've evolved! Fans of dance, electronic and pop should give \\"200 km/h\\" a listen...it may be the new sound you've been looking for.innocent <BR>Do you still have doubts that <BR>Us having makes any sense<br />Julie and Lena do an excellent job of singing in English, which was extraordinarily difficult for them but which sounds near-native to me, although some reviewers have commented on their phonetic English.

B00006RIO7|4.0|i've listened to this so many times already that i have it pretty much going on non-stop rotation in my head right now.  it could be worse, i could have vanilla ice or something stuck in my head :).  word to the wise though, just skip the last two tracks.  they have almost nothing to do with the movie and they are just bad.
0380820846|5.0|I have read all of Julia Quinn's books and this one is my favorite.  Colin and Penelope are great characters, perfect for each other, although it takes them awhile to figure it out.  But when they do sparks fly!  They are by no means perfect people which makes them all the more endearing to the reader.  Their journey of discovery is fun to watch, and the end is satisfying, as we get to see one nasty character get her comuppance, (who I won't disclose here).  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a fun read and likable characters!
B0000797IO|3.0|While Jen An (Justine) gives a performance that is so different from her famous alter-ego (Rachel Greene), the storyline was not as intriguing as Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful (starring Diane Lane).  It's not a surprise that Justine has to deal with the consequences of her infidelity, but the ending in the movie was just way too abrupt.  Some of the deleted scenes should have made it into the final cut, especially the one where Holden reveals his decision to rob the store and his intentions behind it.<br />That said, this is not a bad DVD to own.
B00005OAIE|5.0|THIS CD IS A GREAT ONE!! HE HAS A GREAT VOICE AND IS A GREAT GUTIAR PLAYER! MAYER SINGS ABOUT REAL LIFE. EVERY SONG HE SINGS, YOU CAN REALLY RELATE TO.
B00006690G|3.0|here's just what i think about each of the tracks, and please note that i don't own this cd but i borrow it from my sister alot.<br />1.CURTAINS UP:no point saying what i think of it because it only goes for 10 secondes.<br />2.WHITE AMERICA:one of me favourite songs by eminem. I like it how he raps viciously in this song, and the music goes great with the rapping and the chorus is pretty good. I like more of eminem vicious rapping then his weak rapping (e.g. without me).<BR>Overall i would give this song a 10/10<br />3.Business:hmmm one of his more weak rapping, but it is a great song to party and sing to and it does have great sound effects and the chorus is good, so think it deserves a 9/10<br />4.CLEANIN OUT MY CLOSET:this song is between weak rap and vicious rap, and it is very slow which is something i do not really like, but it is interesting to listen to him explaining what makes him so upset with his mother, though i think this song was just way to overplayed on the radio so it deserves a 7/10<br />5.SQUARE DANCE:this is one of the catchiest songs on the album and it is very similair to BUSINESS, so yes it is great to party to, but i think the rapping is more vicious than BUSINESS, so i think it deserves a 9.5/10<br />6.THE KISS(skit):great skit with some great music flowing through it while eminem is talking, but i still don't think i should rate a skit seeming it isn't exactly music.<br />7.SOLDIERS:another one of my favourite songs on the album seeming it has vicious rap, and by the way when i say vicious rap i mean angry rapping. This song has great sound effects,(e.g. in the middle of the song you hear ambulances and gun shots),so yeah a good enough song that deserves a 10/10<br />8.SAY GOODBYE TO HOLYWOOD:oh my god he sounds like a popstar when you hear the chorus, and even through out the song he is rapping very weakly, so i would give it a 5/10<br />9.DRIPS:the worst song on the album, i hate that guy obie trice who is featured in this song, and thelyrics are awful with alot of explicit sexual refrences, i mean people who would listen to this song. People must think his a real sicko so i think this is worth a 2/10<br />10.WITHOUT ME:this song has such weak rapping, and it is was way to overplayed on the radio, and he sounds up himself when he says it would feel so empty without me. I would give this a 5/10<br />11.PAUL ROSENBERG(skit):i hate his skits it's bad...<br />12.SING FOR THE MOMENT:my favourite song from the album which was out on single. This is a very sad song talking about life for him at home, and even the chorus sounds sad. This song would more fit in with the in between weak and vicious rap, and i like it how once emniem finish rappings you here this nice guitar blues, and i like it how aero smith sings the chorus. GREAT SONG!!!!!! 10/10<br />13.SUPERMAN:similair to DRIPS, but no where near as gross and thank god it doesn't feature obie trice, or anyone. The thing i like about this song is the music and the rapping, though it is in between vicious rap and weak rap. Overall 8/10<br />14.HALIE's SONG:i don't see why people love this song so much, i mean its sweet but his not rapping, his singing and its a very slow song. But i can't say i hate it so it deserves a 5/10<br />15.STEVE BERMAN(skit):its ok.<br />16.WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS:this song features d12. This song has terrible.. lyrics. The good things about this song is that it is vicious rap and it does have great sound effects so i think it deserves a 7/10 <br />17.SAY WHAT YOU SAY:this song features DR.DRE. It is vicious rap but its really easy to get bored of and it isn't really any thing special so it should be a 6/10<br />18.TILL I COLLAPSE:excellent sound effects great in between weak and vicious rapping but the chorus is very boring. 8/10<br />19.MY DAD's GONE CRAZY:features his daughter Hailie Jade. The rapping is okay but its a bit to weak and eminem and his daughter are kind of macking around but there's just something i like about this song. 8/10<br />overall it is a great cd and i like to listen to some times but i honestly do prefer rock. i hope my review did help you because this took me an hour to do, any way thanks for reading it.
B000009VOL|5.0|This is a masterpiece. Haunting and mesmerizing. It is a testament to the proposition that musicianship is about the sound and mood created as much as technical prowess. <br />The musical voices blend perfectly to create a unique sound that mirrors the lyrics and emotions. The album progresses from track to track effortlessly and gracefully like a stream somewhere deep in the forest that twists and winds through civilization on its way to the ocean. The progression is as natural as the water cycle. <br />The production is sparse. The timing is purposely erratic reminding you that life itself is not set to the atomic clock maintained by the government, but by natural progressions more like Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. The vocals are brilliant.   <BR>A classic for our time! I strongly suggest that you check out Cat's earlier work especially &quot;What Would The Community Think&quot; as well. Another classic!
B00004Y6Q5|3.0|This is a good soundtrack no doubt, but the music just doesn't have the same impact on the eardrum and soul when it's separated from the graphic images from the film (which by the way remain scorched onto my retina to this day).  Still, it's some intense classical if there's such a thing.  Just don't play it for your girlfriend if you're trying to cheer her up.
B00005JLS0|2.0|Sandra Bulluck (who is my favorite actress, by the way) never looked good in this movie and the chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was missing.  Neither her character nor Hugh's was particularly like-able and the ending was, of course, predictable, but lacking in real emotion.  Wait for cable.
B000002TQV|4.0|This is Radiohead's second best album, in my opinion (Ok Computer is 1st). It is certainly a big step up from Pablo Honey. Pablo Honey wasn't bad, but it wasn't a very convincing debut for this amazingly talented band. The Bends takes the best moments of Pablo Honey and adds to it more texture and much stronger melodies. The lyrics are also stronger and Thom Yorke has developed a falsetto. I couldn't give it a full 5 stars because there is still a bit of filler here, most notebly &quot;bullet proof, i wish i was&quot;, &quot;black star&quot; and &quot;sulk&quot; which all run into each other. This is Radiohead's last straight ahead rock/pop album before they introduced electronic elements into thier sound. The Bends is still a unique mind blowing assault to the senses and will prepare you for whats to come.
6305127646|5.0|This is one of my favorite action adventures of all time (right up there with Indiana Jones and The Mummy).  Val Kilmer is SO perfect and Elizabeth Shue is adorable and intelligent and quirky.  I guess I should give up waiting for a sequel, though?
B00001OH7G|5.0|If you think a white Irish lad can't play Chicago-style slide-guitar blues, you haven't heard this CD. Not only can he sing and play the blues, but he also can handle hard guitar rock with equal aplomb. Rory Gallagher is right up there with other legendary guitarists like Eric Clapton, Duane Allman, Johnny Winter and Stevie Ray Vaughan, but he's easily the least known of the group. He was said to be a quiet guy offstage, and he was never really interested in advancing his career through the release of Top 40 singles, so they say. He was regarded enough to appear on-stage with blues master Muddy Waters and others, but he was still better-known in Europe, especially his native Ireland, than the US. But this guy is among the great bluesmen of all time, and his on-stage persona, on this album, at least, is larger than life. He gets the crowd fired up with the opening track &quot;Cradle Rock&quot;, belting out the lyrics, featuring solid guitar riffs and assisted by the keyboards of Lou Martin. He then winds down to his cover of Waters' &quot;I Wonder Who (Will be Your Sweet When I'm Gone)&quot;, a solid piece of slide-guitar blues. My favorite track is &quot;Too Much Alcohol&quot;, written by another Chicago bluesman, J B Hutto. He also can play sad, introspective songs like &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot;. Other good track include &quot;Tattoo'd Lady&quot; and &quot;Walk on Hot Coals&quot;. This is a good live album by any standard, and a good offering by an underappreciated talent.
B00006RIO7|4.0|Overall, I have to agree with most of the reviews already posted. The music is incredible. On the downside, The bonus material is weak. Queen Latifah should have just not done her song featuring Lil'Kim and Macy Gray, and Anastacia's &quot;Love is a Crime&quot; is as about as exciting as watching mud.
0151008116|5.0|I originally thought, cynically, that Jann Martel had chosen the subject of &quot;Survival&quot; because, as he himself said at the beginning of his novel, his second book went nowhere and therefore he would find a subject with appeal.  Survivor stories on TV are popular.  However, he had no ordinary survivor story of a group of adults on a remote island.   This was a young boy surviving for 7 months on an open boat and home-made raft on the Pacific Ocean with a live, wild tiger!   I have changed my view and see this as a journey from &quot;Innocence&quot; to &quot;Experience&quot; Martel chose a tiger from William Blake's poem &quot;The Tyger&quot; in his series &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; and the Indian boy represents the &quot;Little Black Boy&quot; from &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot;.   A remarkable novel.<BR>Elaine Bunbury author,  &quot;What Hope Have You!&quot;
0312265859|3.0|Ms. Evanovich hasn't lived near or apparently seen Trenton in many years. I'm tired of Plum. For the real deal, for real comedy try Chris Klim's Jesus Lives in Trenton instead.
0345428064|5.0|I heard of Andy McNab through the letters pages of the excellent espionage comic &quot;Queen and Country&quot; by Greg Rucka. McNab came highly recommended from Rucka, a writer I hold in high regard, so I thought I'd give him a chance. To say the least, I was floored. &quot;Remote Control&quot; is as good a spy thriller as you're bound to find these days. It mixes excellent &quot;working field knowledge&quot; with high suspense. Moreso, you get the feeling that, as highly trained as Nick Stone is, he is still as vulnerable as you or me - not some invincible Bond-type figure. It makes the violence in the book all the more riveting when you take this into consideration.<br />About the only flaw I found in the book is some minor points of characterization with the young girl, Kelly. Without giving away the plot, I will say that her reactions to her entire situation were a little too calm and understanding, especially considering her age. I doubt a real child of 8 or 9 would be able to keep a cool emotional head as she does throughout the majority of this book.<br />That said, the end of this book, and how Kelly is involved, is absolutely stunning. A wonderful read! I look forward to reading more of McNab's work.
B00005YUTD|1.0|My son is a big fan of Baby Mozart so I thought he may like this one too. Not so! After reading other reviews I now see that others have the same problem that I do; my son cries when he watches it. I have tried several times to get him to watch it, only to get the same reaction over and over. We never have this problem with the Mozart video.<BR>While this is not the most captivating video for adults, I have watched about 7 minutes of it before my son gets upset. Compared to the Mozart video there is much less movement and few contrasting colors and designs. She did not incorporate as many animals or puppets into Bach, something that my son loves about Mozart. I must say that the children in the video are not very interesting either (cute, but not necessary to the video.) <BR>My advice is to skip this one and buy Mozart instead.
B00006879E|1.0|I bought this disc because the song, \\"Harder to Breathe\\" is actually pretty good. The rest of the disc, however, totally blows goats, in my opinion. I am a rocker who is open to new stuff, but this ain't it ! Besides the first song, the rest of this disc sounds like that crap you hear on top 40 stations. CORPORATE RADIO SUCKS !! Looks like I accidently stepped into the wrong genre of music. Unfortunately, I threw away my receipt and now I'm stuck with it. I guess I'll have to sell it on the used CD market for like 3 bucks. If you hear \\"Harder to Breathe\\" on the radio and think you want this disc, SAVE YOUR MONEY !! Just tryin' to help you out ! Later Daze-----
B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord of the Rings: Two Towers, has much to recommend it as a outstanding adaptation of a breathtaking classic, <BR>while (thankfully) making no pretences at being anything other than <BR>what J. R. R. Tolkien originally meant it to be; the MIDDLE of that very intriguing tale.  <br />Somehow, the middle book was adapted to film in such a way that one doesn't feel cheated at being able to know only part of the whole story.<BR>   How were they able, for example, to keep its loose ends untied and its secrets still locked away -for the third and final movie to uncover; <BR>while still allowing the viewer to come away from it feeling as if unresolved items have been solved!?!  <br />Understandably, this middle movie can't follow the books sequence as undeviatingly <BR>as they were able to do in the first, or the real focus of Tolkien's tale would be lost via condensed and reduced scene cuts; <BR>in fact, the really surprising factor is how well the slim sequence switch-a rounds take place!  <BR>These surreptitious modifications do no harm to the plot, while allowing for limitations films must always face when transferring text to visual screen.<br />As an avid admirer of J. R. R. Tolkien's brilliant work, I can truly say that none of this trilogy has disgraced him.   <BR>The written word is finally coming to life without a flaw; and Tolkien would be proud!

0060005424|4.0|The book was great, yes.  But I beleive Garth Nix spent too much time on background for the characters.   We get to know Lirael and sameth very well, but they're adventure only begin as the book draws to an end.  Obviously, there is supposed to be a cliff hanger, but 705 pages or so should be enough to tell the story if there was not so much focus on the characters in the beginning.  I did love the book overall, I really did.  This is just something I've been saying for nearly a year now.  I am young and like to argue thing sometimes so you don't have to listen to my statements if you don't want to.  I do however encourage anyone who reads this to read Lirael.  It is at the top of my list of favorite books.
0060523794|3.0|A kingdom grows and prospers by conquering new lands. For years it stands virtually unchallenged. Things change. It loses battles to new competitors, and shrinks. Their aristocracy seeks a winning strategy from a new general. Forces are withdrawn from areas not worth contesting to reinforce areas where the battle is critical. Having accomplished his mission, the general retires. The kingdom is now in better shape for having shed their colonies. THINK of an overloaded lifeboat (Boston case in 1850s). The first mate reduces the number of passengers, allowing most to survive. The blame should be on the situation, not the correction. (My condolences for those thrown overboard.) Or pick your own parable.<br /><br />This is written for a general audience, but not everyone will benefit from the contents. I think a lot of stories were left out. This easily read book shows Gerstner would make a good journalist.<br /><br />Gerstner's first and basic decision was to reduce the cost to mainframe customers. They used CMOS transistors (like in home computers) for a lower cost, and IBM renewed its emphasis on customers. This reversed the decline in mainframes and saved the company. The loss of billions required drastic cuts, not just in a bloated administration, but in surplus productive employees. Expenses would have to drop faster than the decline in gross profits (p.63). Page 59 says \\"competitors in the computer industry, unlike any other industry I know, try to create unique standards that they own\\". This is the result of Anti-Trust Laws that allow you to put a generic tire on a Chevy or Ford. Page 64 tells of the fiefdoms of multiple accounting systems, and the need to update and simplify them. Didn't General Motors go thru this same trial around 1982? Page 66 tells of the sale of \\"unproductive assets\\". Page 72 mentions the interaction between ability and morale or reputation.<br /><br />Gerstner's proudest accomplishment is that his successor and the heads of all major business units are longtime IBM veterans. This happens when a company brings in outside consultants to do what is needed, and then leave.<br />Page 257 mentions the \\"wild pronouncements\\" like \\"the paperless office\\" (people want tangibles, and read in many places), or \\"dot-com universe\\" (people want social interaction). Did these originate as customer demands? Chapter 28 underlines the problem of a corporation. High-level managers who get rich through fraud or embezzlement is not new; read the history books for similar events from the 1870s to 1930s. Today's dot-coms are like yesteryear's railroads. Was the media flaunting the \\"new economy\\" a few years ago? Doesn't the business side of the media always control the editorial side? Gerstner mentions the role of \\"investment bankers\\" (p.260); they have been the most powerful members of our ruling class since the 18th century. Pages 261-3 list some common sense cures. A company controlled by its owners is better than a corporation run by hirelings. Page 271 explains the difference between \\"cash flow\\" and \\"revenue\\".<br /><br />Chapter 30 asks about the corporation and the community. Before the 1860s no corporation could be chartered unless it served a public purpose (canals, waterworks, railroads). Corporate contributions may be a vestige of this tradition. Preventing companies from incorporating unless they served a public purpose would answer this question.
B000066C1N|5.0|I can't deny it, I can't hide it, I can't say the contrary but the music and the lyrics from Spirit are simply wonderful! After listening its soundtrack for the first time, I kept remembering  and singing its songs to myself all the time, for several days after! You must have this CD in your collection or live forever without knowing its beauty! Brilliant! Brilliant! What else can I say? Congratulations Bryan Adams! Congratulations Hans Zimmer!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This CD is unbelievable.  I wasn't as fond of Tidal before I heard this CD, and now i am addicted to both.  if this isn't one of the cds in my player at all times, i am at a total lack of potential.  this cd has all of my respect and adoration.  she is a remarkable lyricist, incredibly talented pianist, and her voice is one i envy on a daily basis.  <br />Amazing?  No--BEYOND amazing.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I totally disagree with the Editorial review. I guess this is one you will either love or hate, but my guess is that most will LOVE it, as I do. If you like &quot;No Such Thing&quot; then you will love this CD. I just got it and can't stop listening to it.  There isn't a song on it that isn't good. Everyone who has listened to mine has run out to get one of their own.
B000021YQV|1.0|I was a little worried about this album when I bought it. The first time I heard a song off it was on the radio. \\"chop suey\\" right.... I loved the first album. The first time I heard it it instantly became one of my favorite bands. I'm not saying that SOAD becoming so ridiculosly main stream made me hate it. At first I was kinda glad that one of the bands I actually liked was getting played on the \\"M\\" tv (As opposed to the regular TV). But after so very much of their commercialization it's hard to belive in their artistic motives. I remember getting the first album back in 99 or so. Then it was so pure, so free. I thought that system was actually about something. But then this second album came out and ruined it all. Granted it does have some musical merits. That could be the excuse for it to do so well. But I think that it's mostly from that \\"chop suey\\". I hate it when self loathing suburbanites latch on to song just because they want to hear all about people affirm the concepts of depression and people's abillity to endure it. If your parents buy you a some tricked out truck you have no right to claim that your life is unfair. Perhaps the only reason that people like that think they're unhappy is because they don't see that their high school lives are shallow and meaningless. But thats not the reason why I was upset. The problem that I had is that it's obvious if you take a song like shop suey and play it on the \\"M\\" tv then theres going to be one prime group of people that watch it. Unfortunatley that goup of people aren't the kind that appreciate system for it's artisic ability. It's moreso the aforementioned group of disillusioned teeny bopers just waitng to exhibit their new found angst. And I think that system knew that too. Chop Suey isn't a good song. It was more of an appeal, a hook if you will to launch SOAD in to it's current state. I don't know if it was actually system's choice to make it their single and music video. Perhaps it was Americanrecords/sony's decision (by the by, sony bought the label sometime between the first and second albums). But now it's so hard to belive that SOAD is anything more than another marketing attempt to prey on feeble minded teens. Don't buy this album, buy the first one, and then make angry statements to people who run around singing \\"..angels deserve to die...\\".

B0000640VO|5.0|I got this DVD on impluse and was pleasantly surprised by it. I enjoyed it -- just like having afternoon tea outdoor on a gorgeous day.  Something to unwind with just a touch of whimsical.  This movie probably won't make you laughing uncontrollably but will sure give you a smile that last for days and months whenever you think about it.
B000000W6X|5.0|I bought this album about 10 years ago.   I had read a glowing review in Rolling Stone Magazine which had made me feel adventurous enough to go out and buy an album from a group that I had never heard of.  So there I was in the store looking at the cover of this album.  It didn't look promising.  Trust me, I had my doubts.  I bought it anyway.<br />After putting the CD in and hearing the first track Protection I knew that I had made a good decision.<br />This album is a full album.  The people behind Massive Attack managed to create a sound that is full, just enough highs, just enough lows.  The producers behind Massive Attack seem to view the singer as an instrument.  Certain songs require different instruments, so they change out the vocalist and bring in one more appropriate for the tone, and feel of the song.  <br />The one oddity on this album that sticks out like a sore thumb on the first few listens is the last track: a live cover of Light My Fire.  At first it seems rough in comparison to the studio perfection of the rest of album.  After a few listens though the track seems like an extra little &quot;thought you might like this,&quot; added on for your pleasure.  <br />I bought this album 8 years ago, and it has consistently made it's way back into the CD player.  Do buy this album.
B000002BBY|4.0|The Oasis are one of my favorite bands.  They have made great albums but &quot;What's the Story(Morning Glory)?&quot; is their best yet.  A lot of the songs are different than their previous album.  My favorite songs include: Wonderwall,Don't Look Back In Anger, Some Might Say, What's the story(Morning Glory)?, and Champagne Supernova.  Now I will admit that I am not the biggest Oasis fan but this is a great album.  They aren't sell-outs (thank God)!  They are a band that's not in it just for the money but for the music and the fans.  That's what a band is all about.  This is the best album I've heard in a long time.  If I was you, I wouldn't waste my money on any other CD.
0316666343|5.0|I simply loved the way this book started out!! The first chapter was as awesome as the following ones. Of course the very start may give you a fright but it was very worth it to continue reading it. As soon as I was done reading all 42 of the sample pages online I had headed out on the same night to buy the book.... I continued to read for 2 days and I reached the end of a superior ending of a great book. I could tell that from reading from Susie's point of view, the author herself must've had a real life experience of a girl she had possibly known raped. The action in this book never drew my attention away from the plot even once. I could just say I loved it.

B00001QEE8|5.0|Based Rudyard Kipling's classic story, Disney's JUNGLE BOOK delivers a laugh out loud, fun, sing-along classic. In my opnion, this was one of the most fun Disney classics. Along with a great soundtrack and fun musical numbers, the entire family will enjoy this one.<br />Mogli is a young boy who was orphaned when he was a baby and then was found by a pack of wolves. Now that Mogli is older, Shiar Khan the tiger, wants Mogli dead. Now the wolves and Bagira the panther have to bring him back to the human village to be with his own kind and for his own safety. Mogli wants no part of that and while running away from Begari's sight, he runs into Baloo, a fun loving Bear who teaches Mogli how to have a good time and the &quot;Bear Necessities&quot;.<br />I really love this movie. This one is a lot of fun. I only had one problem with this movie and that was a little animation recycling in the &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; scene with King Louie (if you saw ROBIN HOOD or ARISTOCATS, you'll see what I mean). But even that wasn't enough for me to take off a star. I still think this is a 5 star Disney classic.<br />If you're looking for other fun Disney classics, check out ROBIN HOOD, ALICE IN WONDERLAND and WINNIE THE POOH 25th Anniversary DVD. And if you're looking for a great Rudyard Kipling book, look for RIKI TIKI TAVI. Enjoy!

B0000666DW|5.0|Here's an analogy to help you understand the hype behind this album: Remission is to 2002 what Metallica's Master of Puppets was to 1986. Mastodon has stepped out on a limb and destroyed many of the common barriers in metal in order to save it from redundancy, from reinstituting epic, climactic song structures, to using obscure harmonizations in the guitars, and the drumming which deserves a sentence of its own. The percussion of Remission defies any sort of common standard it consists entirely of fills and rarely resorts to a constant beat, reminiscent of orchestral drumming. Remission has made metal safe for another generation of pushing barriers until the next Mastodon comes along to break them.
B000005DQR|5.0|Wait a second....yeah. This is the best album ever.
1573229725|3.0|Fingersmith is Victorian street slang for pickpocket, and in this story, it's not just purses that are being purloined. The double entendre of the title is but a hint of the trickery that Waters has up her sleeve. Just when you think you know what's going on, and who can be trusted, the author deftly pulls the rug out from underneath you. And, like the characters in the book, you'll be scrambling to keep your wits. From the first sentence, you'll be immersed in a Victorian whirlpool that would make Dickens envious. This compelling page-turner is replete with pickpockets and thieves, anonymous pornographers, changelings, rat infested slums, sequestered country manors, madhouses, public hangings, daring escapes, deception, stolen identity and seduction.<br />This book is not really my type because I like scary books but It is a really good book
0151008116|5.0|Yann Martel's &quot;Life of Pi&quot;, is breathtakingly original, beautifully written, and a wonderful story.  The two sections, one with Pi as a schoolboy in India, and the second with him lost at sea are both fantastic.  The ending is marvelous.  If you think most of today's bestsellers are intellectual junk food, you will consider &quot;Life of Pi&quot; a gourmet feast!  This book is simply an astonishing feat, and is not to be missed.
B00004T9UF|5.0|After Eminems Debut Album The Slim Shady LP it was hard to tell if he could keep it up and he did. I like this album because of the personal being. This really brought out Eminem. My favorite tracks are Under the Influence( I can really relate to that ) and Drug Ballard. These i consider great out of just good. All the tracks are good but these two grabbed my attention the most. Under the Influence just boosted me up. I would love to tell someone that. Its great to get trashed and high to and so is Drug Ballard. I would reccomend this to any gangsta rap fan. This is a gotta get. so go out buy it!
B000002U8G|3.0|Pink Floyd's Meddle is a solid precursor to Dark Side of the Moon, but now it seems rather dated. However, it deserves some merit as it exemplifies the group's ability to pull off each song without the aid of backup musicians. The first track, \\"One of these Days\\" is a little overrated. I just can't stand the lengthy buildup, with all the dissonant sounds, and Nick Mason's horribly distorted voice. Once all the instruments kick in, however, it becomes an exciting rock number. The next two tracks, \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" and \\"Fearless\\" are folksy, mellow tracks, the latter of which culminates in a bunch of audience cheers(annoying to say the least). Roger Water's jazzy \\"San Tropez\\" is my favorite track here, and possibly one of Pink Floyd's most underrated songs. I just love the basslines and piano solos throughout the song. The next track, \\"Seamus\\" is basically album filler. Then there's the final track \\"Echoes\\" which I consider to be Pink Floyd's most overrated song. The eerie buildup is fine, as are the melodious verses, but after about seven minutes the song gives way to a lengthy jam section which fades into a sequence of chaotic noises. Why is the aforementioned section so nightmarish? More importantly, what are these synthesized noises supposed to represent? Fortunately, the song gets better as it progresses by returning to its original melody, only to fade again with the sound of howling wind. Overall, then, Meddle is a worthy earlier effort from Pink Floyd, save in for one weak track (\\"Seamus\\"), and some dreary instrumental passages in certain songs. Still, recommended for any die-hard Pink Floyd fan.
B00006LWSF|5.0|I heard so much about the movie and soundtrack but never had a chance to watch the movie. I decided to get the soundtrack because of the Lose Yourself song and the Wanksta song. The cd turned out great. Its a great listen all the way through cd. its got a mix of heavy rap and more mellow rap. My favorite songs on the cd are Rabbit Run by Eminem, 8 Mile by Eminem, Places to Go by 50 Cent, Wanksta by 50 Cent, Lose Yourself by Eminem. There are still many other great songs but these seem to have the most meaning to me, Rabbit Run especially. When Eminem says \\" Sometimes I just want to quit.. my life is just one big ball of .... Thats the reality of life. Eminem just says it like no other rapper. So if you want a good CD go out and buy this one. You wont be disappointed!
B00005QW5X|5.0|This movie rocks, plain and simple.  Its a bit more realistic than Rocky Horror Picture Show by many means but still has a strong taste of fantasy.  My favorite scene has to be where Hansel (Hedwig) is laying naked at the city dump eating gummy bears.  Hedwig (also named as Hansel) is a singer.  He falls for a young grunged out guy and basically transfers him into a fem hottie and the guy abandons him and steals everything hedwig stands for.  Hedwig paints a silver X on his forehead and the guy uses it as a gimic and also steals his songs.  Basically the movie follows Hedwigs search for him to get into a concert to let it be known that the guy ripped him off.  He still holds a torch for him though.  It deals with alot of thinking back.<BR>Its a great movie.  I was a rocky brat for the majority of my life but this movie blows rocky out of the water which i found suprising.  Rocky was all about sex where Hedwig is incredibly sexy but it also deals with the heart. Buy it... You wont be disapointed.  If you loved Rocky, youll treasure \\"Hedwig and the Angry Itch\\".
B00006690G|3.0|The Eminem Show is ok. its way different then the other cds. Theres alot of ok tracks. Only a couple great tracks. My favorite tracks on the cd are:Without Me and Cleanin out my closet. Well, if you like eminem you might be a little disappointed but just cuz his other cds were so successful i take that in consideration. I got all of Eminem's Cd and by far this is his worst. I would reccommend this cd if you got his other cds. To see his changes. ... i think his next cd will beat this one.ritney, the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync,  Sad, truly sad....<br />Well, what can you expect from a generation that grew up taking its musical tastes from MTV, where sadly, over the last ten years, the only program where you could see good videos from technically apt bands was during Beavis and Butthead episodes...<br />Can humanity go any lower?  I don't think so...   It all has to be uphill from here...love the scratching at the beginning. Dirty South beat, which is different for Eminem. This track goes into lyrics dissing the US Office of Priesdent Bush and the Senate. This does mention the terrorism, which this is about the world today. Lyrics catchy. (4 out of 5)<br />6) The Kiss (Skit) - Reminader of the Guerra incident involving Eminem.<br />7) Soldier - One of the beats that Eminem ever produced, some people didn't like this one. I do feel it has a 2pac flow in there. I don't believe it would have a Dirty South feel, but this track is outstanding talking about being a Gangster and guns. Beat is so Tight. (5 out of 5)<br />8) Saying Goodbye Hollywood - Pressures of Fame and how he wants to leave it behind and not forced to be trapped. Catchy Hook and I rated this track. (4.5 out of 5)<br />9) Drips Featuring Obie Trice - Sick track to women, which Obie Trice is featured on the track and does an unbelieve verse, which outshines Eminem only by a little. Eminem does really have a brillant verse. Creepy Hook. (4.5 out of 5)<br />10) Without Me - Lead single on disses on Chris Kirkpatrick (N'Sync) and Moby (I'm glad he dissed him, as his music isn't good expect for a James Bond track he did). Eminem Produced. (4 out of 5)<br />11) Paul Rosenberg (Skit) - Nothing much there, expect his manager tells him not to bring his gun.<br />12) Sing for a Moment - This track is brillant featuring a sample of Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\", not only that he features Steve Perry (The Guitarist of Aerosmith) to do the final instrumental to the song. (5 out of 5)<br />13) Superman Featuring Dina Rae - I like the second hook but apart from that, this track is Garbage like Cleaning Out My Closet. (2 out of 5)<br />14) Hailie's Song - The only track that Eminem songs. I thought I wasn't going to like this, but I felt this was one of the best tracks on the album. It shows a Sensitvite side to Eminem as the only lady, he loves is Hailie. Good Jazz/Rock Beat. I felt a little Disapointted by the rap but the singing makes it top marks. (5 out of 5)<br />15) Steve Berman (skit) - This maybe the final Steve Berman as he is shot dead by Eminem.<br />16) When The Music Stops Featuring D-12 - This track starts with Bizaree saying things within the business like having Responabilites to kids. This is another track about the price of Fame, as mentioned by Eminem's and Kon Artis's Verses. Bizaree talks about that NWA say \\"F*** tha Police\\" and he ended up in jail. I love this track to bits. (4.5 Out of 5)<br />17) Say What You Say Featuring Doctor Dre - At first I didn't like this track. But i grew into this track because of the beat. It reminds me of Fight Music I Don't know why, but it does to me. I love Dre's Diss to Jeramine Dupri, saying Dre \\"Mini-Me\\" and the mini you's are Dupri.  It has Timbaland at the end on a telephone call saying they could S*** my d***. (4.5 Out of 5)<br />18) Til I Collapse Featuring Nate Dogg - This track has a real funky beat produced by Eminem. Nate does a brillant hook and does brillant background vocals, if you could the second time of hook after each verse. Eminem goes about the skills of an MC and saying he rips at their hearts and he feels he ain't going to get the props that he fully deserves. I like the Intro to the track. This track is top. (5 Out of 5)<br />19) My Dad's Gone Crazy Featuring Hailie Jade - This is Eminem going back to Slim Shady. I thought the best part was the opening part of the second verse, where he is his mum and then says he would do certain things including Gospel and swear all day. Nice adding his Daughter to add the feel of Eminem going crazy. (4.5 Out of 5)<br />20) Curtains Close (Album Outro) Featuring Ken Kaniff - I had enough of this guy. It's getting old, but the eariler days back on the Slim Shady LP, which Ken character was funny.<br />This album is top expect for the tracks Cleaning Out My Closet (PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT THE SECOND SINGLE AND THE SAME WITH) and Superman (Don't make this single please Slim)<br />Brillant tracks and Productions, Shady you're Strong.<br />You are Gifted like The Notorious B.I.G, Tupac, Nas, Jay-Z, Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Outkast, Xzibit, Method Man, Redman, Ludacris, Slick Rick (Old School Days) and Gang Starr. <br />God Bless You Eminem (Marshall Mathers)
B000001F9E|3.0|im looking for a certain song it was&quot;nt avalible for sampling i think its the cowboy song but what i heard i liked i&quot;ll probably buy it right now thou im going to listen to another album.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|...can you truely appreciate this movie.  Filling up the bath water in the fountain, falling through the floors, yes it does happen, and can all happen to you too.  My wife and I did our dishes and showered in the bathtub for 2 months as it was our only working plumbing.  Now that our renovation is done, as soon as the dvd is out, we plan on reliving our last year with Tom and Shelly.  <br />For any newlywed couples wanting to renovate a house, watch the movie.  Contrary to what you may believe, this really is the pain you'll go through, and everything that can go wrong, will.  But it's all worth it if you survive the process...
B000067CPX|5.0|By the Way, one of the greatest albums I have ever heard, it is a masterpiece and a true work of art. You could take every track and make it a single, there is no bad song on this cd. I could die for you, a song that just blows my mind away. If you don't have this album, get it!! In my opinion one of the best albums of all time if not the best.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I would've been about 5 when I first saw this movie and was unable to make up my mind about it until, nearly 10 years later, I was given the chance to see it again, so I took that chance.<br />What I saw was a beautiful, artistic and flawless animated film with well-written and surprisingly complex and different characters (which is something I normally don't see in Disney). <br />THE MAIN CHARACTERS:<br />BELLE:<br />Belle has definately become my favourite female Disney character as she differs so much from the typical Disney heroine. She is intelligent, slightly eccentric, and instead of sitting around, dreaming about her dream guy, she chooses to look at what is below the surface and to bring happiness into the lives of others with no selfish motives.<br />THE BEAST:<br />Definately the most complex character of them all, the Beast's persona is many differing shades of grey, and his conflicted feelings and emotions are portryed perfectly through his body language and beautifully expressive eyes that you could just fall into. And through Belle's gentle but unwavering kindness, he learns not only to love again, but also that your heart and personality will always outshine your physical appearance.<br />GASTON: <br />The most handsome and arrogant man in Belle's village, Gaston soon proves that he is also a complex character. While he starts off as a rather stupid-yet-amusing muscle-head who cannot take 'no' for an answer, his character soon begins to reveal that while he is stupid, he makes up for it by being cunning, <BR>manipulative and posessive. Soon, he becomes the 'ultimate evil' in the story when he realizes that Belle has fallen in love with the Beast and will never want to be with him...Basically, it becomes a case of Gaston being read to destroy anything and anybody that gets in the way of what he wants...<br />The other characters, such as Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogworth and Belle's eccentric-but-caring Father, Maurice, are also surprisingly well-developed, considering they are not main characters. Not only do they add spots of comic relief to prevent the movie from being too dark, they are all also VITAL to the story as they help lead it along. Without them, the story would be much emptier and alot shorter.<br />And finally, we come to the music. I normally hate when the characters break into song in the middle of a movie, but the songs all fit into the movie perfectly without giving it a \\"dragged-out\\" feel. They, like the minor characters, keep the movie going and help inject even more feeling into what is already a masterpiece.<br />Overall, this was, and will always be THE best Disney film ever created, and, just like the tagline, the most beautiful love story ever told. I would recommend this to absolutely ANYBODY!!!
0062502182|5.0|Coelho's Novel 'The Alhemist' is an amazing oddessy of self exploration. Its focus is that of young man at the verge of adulthood. He is fighting the prescribed action of behavior and banking his future on the words of a Sage and the promise of a grat treasure. It is in the search for this treasure that we discern the hidden wisdom, and simplistic poetry of life's journeys. This book is recommended highly for all about to enter a new stage of life, or all who wish to discover a new journey within themselves.
B0000646UN|1.0|To make it short: The picture is very interesting, a must see for every war movie fan. Especially the fighting on the huge-scale sets including vintage russian armour (even a flamethrower tank is roaming the battlefield!) is VERY impressive.<br />However, the DVD edition from a company or label \\"Belle and Blade\\" is one of the worst I have ever seen. The picture quality is sub-VHS Standard, the sound in a flat stereo, the english subtitles are totally oversized and not removable, there are no extras at all - in one word, you'll get pure... for your hard-earned Euros (or Dollars). What a pity, the picture has deserved a decent relaese.<br />So, for the movie itself, I would say 4 out of 5 stars, for the DVD: None at all and a beating for the guys who are responsible for this mess...
B00006EXCC|5.0|In 1966 sandwiched in between the two Beatles releases Rubber Soul and Revolver the Rolling Stones put out Aftermath. This was there first album of entirely original material and their strongest record to date. The first four songs are stones classics that anyone who cares is familiar with. In these remastered versions the clarity is superb. Under My thumb and Lady Jane are especially nice on earphones where the clarity is stunning. Beyond The first four songs there are others on this record that could have been classics in another context. There are two fine rockers, Flight 505 and It's Not Easy. The softer tunes I Am Waiting and Take It or Leave It. Out Of Time could have been a hit on it's own. The version of Out of Time on this disc, With all the Stones in place is much better than the one recorded by Jagger alone (as a demo for Chris Farlow) with the heavy orchestration. 1966 was a time of experimenting with exotic instruments in rock and Brian Jones rose to the occasion bringing in sitar, dulcimer and marimbas.  The only bad points to this disc is that the song Going home does plod on a little long and Paint it black wasn't included as a bonus track so one could resequence the order of the songs on your CD player to simulate the American version. But then Alan Klein doesn't think like a fan but a sticky fingered moneygrubber.  On the front cover is the UK version designed by Andrew Oldham that Brian Jones hated on the inside flap is the photo used on the American release but unfortunately it has been distorted from its original form.   Much has been made of the misogyny of the Stones lyrics. And they are in full form on many of these tracks. At the time of this recording Jagger was in the midst of his on again, off again tumultuous relationship with model Chrissie Shrimpton, a relationship that supplied a lot of fodder for his songs as, heard on this disc. Of Mick's relationships with women Shrimpton said, \\"He would never let the woman be the one to call things off.\\" And of his misogyny, \\"Mick doesn't really respect women...Mick doesn't like women. He never has.\\" Mick was able to fire back in song. But then in Going Home he laments \\"Maybe you think I've seen the world, but I'd rather see my girl.\\" The poor mixed up lad.   This disc is a keeper, a true slice of swinging London in 1966.
B00004Y87O|4.0|It's a good movie. A nice suspense, a good intigue and a lot of action in a surreal atmosphere. It also shows some interesting pieces of high technology from the 1980's (like pumpkin-size walkie-talkies), or from the science-fiction of the time (micro biological implant bombs). Snake Plisken is an interesting character, well played by Kurt Russel.
0441008356|5.0|Some of the best and the hardest science-fiction at the moment is coming out of Britain (Stephen Baxter, Ken MacLeod, Peter F. Hamilton etc.) and Alastair Reynolds is right up there with them. <br />This, is the first novel in what looks like being an almost Xeelee-esque sequence of novels (continued in Chasm City, Redemption Ark and Absolution Gap (forthcoming)) lots of hard-science, mysterious aliens etc.<br />This story starts out as as an archeological novel but rapidly turns into something else as assassins and the crew of a derelict space craft become more and more involved in the ultimate question; where are the aliens?<br />This exploration of the Fermi Paradox treads on familiar territory to anyone who has read any of Stephen Baxter's recent works and comes up with a new and wholly satisfying answer. It also blows the door wide open for it's sequels.<br />If you like superior space opera and can cope with the jargon and the science give it a whirl.
B00005JKNC|1.0|Jim Carrey is doing well in the funny role as usual, however this movie is not the best Carrey movie. It is long, or maybe too hollow, or maybe the pace is too slow. At the same time it focusses on just one, rather small place (Lawson), and the time frame is also short . Also there are some political undertones which I could not really always understand. As to the characters, they are are not too \\"live\\" actually (probably due to the amnesia that stikes Peter/Luke); I was not really impressed by Peter Appleton, Harry Trimble, Irene Teriwilliger, Emmit Smith, Sandra Saint-Clair, Adele Stanton and Lucille Angström Ichtville. The only interesting part of the movie is near the end when Luke (now Mrr Appleton again), reminds us of the 5th and 1st amendments of the Constitution of the United States.
0316666343|3.0|It's hard to imagine that even the most hard-boiled aheists among us don't wonder what heaven might be like.  For Susie Salmon, the protagonist of Alice Sebold's highly acclaimed new novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\", it's a celestial observatory, a minimalist place where simple wish fulfillment allows a young girl to see up close the anguish and passion of the loved ones she's left behind. Given the nature of her death, raped and dismembered at thirteen, the peace Susie feels, even while her family and friends grapple with the horror, is a sweet relief for the reader.<br />It's an irresistible premise, and Sebold goes a long way toward effective development.  The murder occurs near the beginning of the book, and its description is chilling in its simplicity.  Evil lives in a hole in the ground in a cornfield, surrounded by the simple people of a small,non-descript Pennsylvania town.  Sebold's boldest character development occurs during the opening chapters, when we meet Susie and her murderer, Mr. Harvey.  We see things up close and events are so matter of fact that the full horror of things isn't brought to bear until a dog retrieves Susie's elbow from the fields.<br />From here the book loses altitude a bit, becoming more family drama in attitude--Dad breaks down somewhat, though his crystalline grief allows him to correctly identify the murderer from the outset; mother has an affair, grandmother comes to town with an irritating penchant for tippling and telling.<br />All this happens while a bemused Susie watches from above and displays all the posthumous wisdom a thirteen year old can muster about love, evil and redemption.  Here's where writing can either sink or save a novel, and in Sebold's case it does a little of both.  Sometimes Susie's commentary, and her sister's and friends' earthly struggles with ghosts and the truth, do seem haunting and other-worldly.  Other times they degenerate into a variation of \\"Hey, God, It's Me, Margaret.\\"<br />Given the context of the novel it makes for a schizophrenic experience.  At once \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Judy Blume\\", the story lurches a bit thematically and fails to fixate on the most interesting aspects of the characters it develops.  The introduction of some minor characters, all wrestling with the cruelty of death and the long-suffering fate of the creative soul, does more to dilute than stregthen the narrative.<br />With such intense critical acclaim, it's easy to expect a masterpiece.  But this isn't one.  It's engrossing at times, disappointing at others, but ultimately doesn't rise to the heavenly heights to which it aspires.
B00003CXMG|1.0|Characters in it are delirious, at least for me (I am not addicted to the 70's); some of them even do not seem human (or humane), but I can probably  understand why in the particular contxet of this movie.. You can find an excellent summary of the movie in the bonus tracks (DVD version), especially the first track  which which shows the main characters all assembled  to listen to Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to HEAVEN\\".
0792153189|5.0|A few years ago, two movies were made that dealt with asteroids hitting the earth.  One was &quot;Armageddon&quot;, the other was this fine film, &quot;Deep Impact&quot;.  This movie stars Tea Leoni as Jenny Lerner, a reporter for CNBC who discovers news about an &quot;E.L.E&quot;, Extinction Level Event.  Apparently, a comet &quot;the size of Mt. Everest&quot;, according to the film, is on a collision course with earth.  Under orders from the President, played superbly by veteran actor Morgan Freeman, construction on a space vehicle has started.  Built by the United States and Russia, the &quot;Messiah&quot; will deliver eight nuclear warheads, place them inside the rogue comet, and blow it off course.  The Messiah is commanded by astronaut Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall).<br />The comet has a rotation period of fourteen hours, and the crew of Messiah can only work during darkness due to the escaping compressed vapors and extremely high temperatures when the comet is in daylight.<br />After detonation of the warheads, the comet splits into two pieces, and both are still on a collision course with earth.  Meanwhile, people are hoarded to Missouri's limestone hills to live underground until its safe to start over.  The people have been randomly selected by a computer.<br />A plan is devised to fire missiles at the comet to see if they can alter its course, but this ultimately fails as well.  Finally, the crew of Messiah decides to crash their ship and four remaining nukes into the large section of the comet, as its too late to stop the smaller piece from hitting the earth.<br />The special effects in this movie are awesome, especially the entry of the smaller comet into the atmosphere and the ensuing tidal wave that envelops New York City.  Maximillian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, and Elijah Wood do excellent jobs in their roles as well.<br />I feel this movie had a more &quot;human&quot; side to it than &quot;Armageddon&quot;.  I enjoyed both movies, but Armageddon seemed to be a little more &quot;on the edge&quot; than Deep Impact.  In this movie, you could really relate to the characters and the urgency and utter hopelessness of their situation.  I didn't get that feeling with Armageddon.<br />Both of these movies are good in their own right.  I recommend both, but Deep Impact focuses on the plight of the characters more.  I think action movie fans would enjoy them, but perhaps for different reasons.
B000022TSW|3.0|It is definitely a funny movie, however the impressions quickly fade away after viewing and nothing much remains. However it contains enough material to build up a small handbook of hard-core slang phrases and expressions, but I forgot them all and I also forgot all the tunes.
B000002NJS|5.0|20 years ago, a white girl with alot of soul broke into the music scene and changed the world with her music, style, and etc. Very few gave her a chance to last 5 years, but today she is not only lasting...she is making the BEST music. Ray Of Light is hands down, one of the best and most creative albums I have ever heard. THIS is what music should be about. Growing, taking risks, experimenting and really caring about how your music will impact people. My favorite song on this album is Sky Fits Heaven. This song moved me to tears. Other songs I like are Mer Girl, Candy Perfume Boy and Little Star. At a time, when Michael Jackson has gone from cutting edge to scary, Janet Jackson from legit to bland and Whitney from excellent to sad, its so great to see there is still an artist that can progress. I hope Christina A. follows Madonna's examples.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I love it. What else to say ? Annette is a loveable character and remarkably played by Reese Witherspoon; as to the ugly couple/brother-and-sister Kathryn/Sebastian, they are really unpleasant from start to finish, so the end of the movie is really a happy relief; meanwhile poor Cecile is manipulated a lot by these two characters. Altogether it is a good movie if you are interested in psychology and close-knit relationships.
B00004X01U|5.0|This album wasn't as good as the excellent,&quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, but its truly the best pop album of that year. My favorite songs are Impressive Instant, Gone, and Tell Me. Of course America radio refuse to give the &quot;new Madonna&quot; any real chance to have an impact on the single charts because they like to play everything safe. This is what's wrong with music business. Madonna is making her best music and yet, she is not as played on radio as she should be. This is sad, but this album is not. Get it!!
B00005O5CM|5.0|The main plot is average; suspense wasn't the purpose of the movie anyway... The story is simple yet interesting; a few \\"clichs\\" may appear sometimes, but they are treated very lightly so the movie is never boring, on the contrary it is rather funny. There is a progression in the story and the main character (Elle) shows a lot of determination, and finally manages to get all what she wanted: she graduates very successfully and she finds love in the person of Emmett, after getting rid of the obnoxious Callaghan. Altogether, this entertaining movie is also easy to watch.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When you are as talented as Christina, you don't need to dress sleazy to grab people's attention. Your music will do that by itself. I don't know if she feels she needs to compete with Britney or not, but her image is terrible!

B00001PE4D|5.0|there is plenty of things to say about this movie, but to sum it up, it is a very good and very entertaining movie
B00006JIZP|2.0|Like I said above, this album has a lot of slow ballads and the whole album seems to lack energy. The ballads lack any memorable hooks and the only good song that I really liked on it was &quot;treading water&quot;(which is quite a good song). hi-speed soul is halfway decent but thats about it as far as this album is concerned. High/low and the proximity effect are much better choices than this one. nada surf seems to sound somewhat different with every release. They decided to slow it down alot with this one, but it just comes off as boring. In order to play a good ballad there has to be melody and emotion which isnt here. I miss their sound from the high/low (love that song&quot;the plan&quot;) days and wish they would go back to it. anyways maybe they should come back to america and start playing louder, just my opinion
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is by far the best Disney movie ever made. I first saw this movie when it first came out, when I was only young. Now I am older and I think I love it even more! It has always been my favourite movie and it always will be - it has it all. A beautiful tale about a young lion club who overcomes his fears and takes his place as King. There is never a dull moment, the story is great, the music is beautiful, the characters are unforgettable. This is a must-see for ALL ages - a brilliant family movie.
0345409671|3.0|Anne Rice provides a new angle on the God vs Devil discussion. It was very clever of her to use Lestat as a vehicle to explore this angle. But I was let down towards the end of the book because I wasn't able to follow the reasoning why Memnoch decided to be King of Hell and why Hell was described as a school for the souls. Too much happened in the final 5 pages with Lestat returning from Hell. The veil as a miracle, Lestat finally sucking Dora's menses while Armand and David looked on, Maharet returning Lestat's lost eye, Armand's suicide, Mael thinking of suicide - why spend so much effort in building up the climax, only to end with a whimper? <br />And why did the Devil chose Lestat as his assistant? <br />Lestat ranted at the end that both God and Memnoch were mad. I think Anne was mad too.
B0000039PW|5.0|This is most definitely the best album every made. Anyone who did not give it 5 stars is just ridiculous and doesn't understand the true art form of this masterpiece. Lyrically, no one will ever be better than the late great Biggie Smalls. RIP
B00006F7S4|5.0|Yes, Beck is probably one of the most versatile artists of this time. This CD is superb. It comes and go from you sounding like waves coming in and out the sea. <BR>Some of the songs reminded me of Nick Drake (i.e. &quot;round the bend&quot;, #8)<BR>Some of the arrangements also remind George Martin's and Beatles's polyphonic style (i.e. &quot;lonesome tears&quot;, #4, at the end).<BR>I also agree in N.Young's influences but for me they are not as clear as the other ones.<br />In sum, you can find here in a fresh and original way, most of the unperishable and sublime formats of songs heard in the last 30 years of popular music. If you like good rock, don't doubt, get it. Thanks Beck
1400031346|5.0|Okay, I have read and enjoyed the first three, listed here plus Tears of the Giraffe and whatever the third was called. My daughter has it right now.  A gentle series about a really not understood part of the world.  It's also a sort of rally for fat people, or as it is put in the series, traditional size ladies.  Botswana sounds like a little piece of heaven in the disaster that is sub-Saharan Africa.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|The Moulin Rouge Soundtrack is very much of a must. Ewan McGregor is simply bathing in talent which is proven by his dazling perform and extrodinary singing. Taking songs of past song writers, the cast puts up and orginial masterpiece.<br />1. Nature Boy: This is a very good interpretation from Nat King Cole's original version. You must listen carefully, also to the words and the background music. ****<br />2. Lady Marmalade: Many people would say this song is the best on the CD, but it is missing something I just can't grasp. **<br />3. Because We Can: A perfect club song, what more is to be said, except that it is quite rebondant... *<br />4. Sparkling Diamonds: This is a surprisingly good song regardless of the singer who originally sang it (Marilyn Monroe). Kidman interpretates it excellently. ***<br />5. Rythm of the night: I have never been able to go through this whole song. It is boring and has a slight pop style. *<br />6. Your Song: Ewan McGregor takes Elton John's masterpiece and, as I didn't think it possible, made it better. One of the best on the CD. *****<br />7. Children Of The Revolution: This is an average song, it's good and well sung, that's it! ***<br />8. One Day I'll Fly Away: Nicole Kidman sings a very emotional song in this piece, not the best, though. **<br />9. Diamond Dogs: I don't know what they were thinking when they put this on the CD, sure it has the prostitue 'air', but the worst. *<br />10. Elephant Love Medley: Nicole Kidman and Ewan mcGregor mix very well together, even though McGregor shows more emotion in this song, two thumbs up! ****<br />11. Come What May: I personnaly prefer McGregor's singing in this piece, and he does it magnificently, as usual! ****<br />12. El Tango De Roxanne: I hope you don't mind that I put down in words, how wonderful this song is. Ok, so taht wasn't from that song, but it is true! The violins are amazing and both voices here are AMAZING! *******************<br />13. Complainte De La Butte: This french piece really is good and it doesn't take much to like it. ****<br />14. Hindi Sad Diamonds: A very strange song, but takes the same words from \\"Sparkling Diamonds\\". It still is alright! ***<br />15. Nature Boy (Reprise): Very odd...that's all I have to say. **
0800141660|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite films. Everything about it is just superb, from the gorgeous scenery to the clever script to the perfect casting of every role. I could never tire of watching this, it has a deep appeal to the romantic in me.I dare say it will do the same for anyone who loves romance and has an imagination. Ahhh, if only there could be a sequel!! But it IS hard to outdo perfection!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I really felt that this DVD lived up to what I had hoped it would be. While the movie was excellent and caused me to read the entire series, I had high hopes for the DVD. I was not disappointed. The extra features that require you to go through Diagon Alley and Hogwarts were a treat and captured the playful essence of this fun movie.
B00005YXZH|1.0|After falling prey to all the hype regarding this album, I forked over the money and was highly dissapointed. It has none of the great melodies, riff's, or eloquence of previous recordings, most notably, \\"AM\\" and \\"While You Were Here\\".  <BR>I can now understand why several band members quit, and why the record company dropped the band.  Before you buy the album I highly recommend that you get a sample or download some songs first and give it a good listen.  <BR>I have noticed that the album is on the bestseller list of 2002 for Amazon.com.  The only reason I can think of is that Amazon.com preoreded a million copies and is now looking for a way to unload them. <BR>Jeff Tweedy is a remarkable musician.  His previous work with Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, and Golden Smog is nothing short of outstanding.  It is hard to argue with his success and influence.  However, after listening to this album several times I am convinced it will never grow on me.  It is simply not very good.  Save your money, or better yet, buy one of the Golden Smog albums, you'll be happy you did.
1577311523|5.0|A book to \\"Guide\\" one to \\"Spiritual Enlightenment\\". A field guide of sorts. It either works or it doesn't, it gets you to where you'd like to be or you find yourself lost. In this case you can find your way and Eckhart Tolle explains it rather nicely. Not to say there isn't a point or two which could use a little simpler explanation, and why I'd consider giving the book 4 1/2 stars, but these concerned women more than men and being one and not the other perhaps I'm the one at fault and not Mr. Tolle. I am personally aware of some of the enlightenments spoken of in this book and can attest to their being valid. That's why, to me, this is a \\"Good Book\\".
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is the first of all the Baz Lhurmann's movies I had watched. I love the music and the story. Makes one fall in love and encourage people to express themselves, do what is right, and follow what the heart says. The DVD provided special features related to the making of the movie. Great music and cinematography. Makes one want to learn how to dance. :)
B000068PQ0|5.0|i have been a closet lips fan for quite some time now. this album changed that. i no longer hold my love of the lips to myself. upon the purchase of this album, it found it's way into my car's player. there it remained for the next month. i am simply captivated by depth of this album: i find myself noticing more and more the little hidden nuances in the sound. it is like metal detecting for your brain. i highly recomend this album to anyone who appreciates music of any kind. this truly is one of the greatest collections of work i have had the pleasure of experiencing. buy this album: or live with your emptiness.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I hate to be a killjoy and rain on your parade, but &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; fell tremendously short of my expectations.  It's worse than a bad record; it's a bad record that squanders its potential to be good.  The media hype, Grammy nominations, and chart success finally made me run and grab Norah's CD.  I listened with as open a mind as possible, and after just 10 minutes my faith headed south.  Jones is an able piano player, but she and veteran producer Arif Mardin follow the rules of making a jazz vocal record so slavishly that &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; offers almost no surprises.  The disc takes off on a promising note with &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; a warm and seductive number that fits Norah's voice like a hand in leather glove.  But after that, the album lapses into a comatose state from which it never fully recovers.  The production lacks dimension; the arrangements are predictable, and Norah's voice ultimately lacks the urgency to give life to the lyrics.  &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; &quot;I've Got To See You Again,&quot; and the &quot;Nearness of You&quot; all start off well, but they ultimately lack substance, nuance, and depth.  Those who listen exclusively to Top 40 radio will swear to high heaven that &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is the best thing since sliced bread.  But more seasoned, mature, and well-rounded listeners will sigh, &quot;heard it all before.&quot;  If you truly crave for jazz, get the newly remastered deluxe edition of John Coltrane's &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; or the superb compilation &quot;Verve Unmixed,&quot; which features a smattering of vocal artists from the Verve label.  Otherwise, save your money.
B000071ZZI|2.0|Truth be told, I was completely excited to see this movie. After watching the riveting previews, I bought the book to read before hand. Wow! the book was fantastic! But getting to my point. This movie feels like one long preview. There's some epic on your seat chase scenes, and heart warming reunions, but you keep thinkin gto yourself, wait, did I miss something? this can't be the actual movie right? it seems Matt Damon, (giving the best performance he could do with this minimal plot) runs around the whole movie, and can't figure out what the point was. This is nothing like the book, and you're most likely going to be better off reading it than seeing the movie. If you are like me, you will finish it staring blankly at the screen, and saying:<BR>Huh?<BR>Your better off watching the preview, it just about explains the whole movie.
B000002ULO|5.0|Yaaaaaayyyy!!!  Finally Paul releases his first decent and solid album since Tug of War!<br />The only downside I give it is the typical \\"Jeff Lynne\\" produced sound in the guitars and drums that make all these recordings sound the same (listen to other albums like Harrison's Cloud Nine, Petty's Full Moon Fever, and the Traveling Wilbury's recordings and compare them to this and you'll see what I mean) <br />The songs themselves are well written and cover different moods.  Dark (Somedays), playful (Used To Be Bad, Flaming Pie), Rockin' (The World Tonight), Insightful (Young Boy), Remeniscent (Song We Were SInging), etc.<br />Paul is joined by his wife Linda on some of her last recordings w/ Paul, as well as his son James playing a guitar solo, producer Jeff Lynne, Ringo Starr, beautiful orchestration by George Martin, and a duet W/ Steve Miller (he is also featured on a couple other tracks)<br />Bottom Line: A very pleasant and solid album with many good songs and great playing, despite the rather familiar and overused production work by Lynne.
B000031WD9|1.0|The nineties had some highlights: The Usual Suspects, a war won, a good economy, DVD's, and sony playstation. But we must not forget the fertilizer thrown down to grow these beauties, and the number one suspect here is American Pie. Openly, I will say I hope each and every one of the people associated with this movie becomes a failure in the entertainment industry and works a crummy, unfulfilling job the rest of their natural lives.<br />This movie committs a number of faux pas right off the bat. 1.) WAY WAY WAY over used plot. 2) Great, popular versions have already been done (see Porky's). 3) Adds nothing new--basically like doing Star Wars over, just changing names and actors. 4) They had plural directors--it was so bad, no one even had a vision for it. Horrible, right?<br />Oh no, but it gets worse. Every single joke used is a cliche used four million times, not only in Porky's, not only in similar genre'd movies, but movies HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GENRE. That's right. we're looking at an A #1 writing rip-off.<br />But let me go on. the plot is designed  for 14 year old girls on the cusp of going to High school. Why? Because : 1) The four boys in the story could be a boy band 2) The hunky guy is the most sensitive, followed by the boyfriend 3) There's a walking human dung pile in Stifler who is popular and funny. Why is he a clue? Because a loser like him never picks on girls, but is busy giving wedgies and making fun of people on the honor roll, and dumb little girls laugh at them. Pathetic.<br />If you want to see the ineptitude of the people involved in this movie, the directors did a just-as-pathetic movie with Chris Rock dying (I did not laugh once) which was  a retread of Heaven Can Wait, and the casting director was directly involved in the debacle of Stolen Summer.<br />Do your self a favor--ignore any movie employed with any person involved in this festival of dunces. And if you are one of those people--well, chances are you can't read anyway.
B00006879E|5.0|So many genres mixed into one album. Sometimes it's hard to understand the first listen through. Beautiful, soulful lead singer. They'll be big.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I almost consider this movie to be a slasher movie, it's not until the last quarter of the movie that you realize we dealing with a supernatural type of monster. The first half of this movie gets nerves rattled enough to coast through the rest of the movie. There have been a lot of, so called, horror movies out lately but this one wasn't to cheesy and kept you on the edge of your seat. I personally liked this movie because it almost scared me, and that is very rare with the movies that are spewed out now days.
B00004XPPB|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was a great story that sits with some of the best mob pictures out there.  Depp gives an amazing performance and Pacino is as always great.  The story is gripping and the huor makesit very enjoyable.  The fact that this is based on a true story also makes it more compelling.  One word of caution though the story in the movie is pretty far off from what really happened to Agent Pistone but it is still a great movie.  Check out the book as well and you will like it even more.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This has got to be one of Paul's most personal albums since his early days (McCartney & Ram).<br />Although his voice sounds a litte strained, Driving Rain is Paul's best in 20 years since Tug of War. Yes, its been that long ago!!!<br />What makes this album for me is the backing band McCartney has.  The drummer and guitarist in particular (who was w/ McCartney on this past tour) are superb.  His best since his 5th incarnation of Wings (w/ Jimmy McCullach, Joe English, Laine & Linda)<br />The songs are great as well, simple yet effective. Not to mention some of the heaviest sounding material Paul has done (ex. Rinse Through The Raindrops, About You, She's Giving Up Talking). He even does some \\"mock\\" rapping on Spinning On An Axis.<br />Highlights for me: Lonely Road, From A Lover To A Friend, Your Loving Flame, Tiny Bubble, I Do, and Heather.<br />Note: According to one of my Beatle books, Paul had written a song in late '60s entitled \\"Heather\\" about his future stepdauter Heather. It was never recorded by the Beatles.<br />What is neat about this is that for a filler, Paul stuck Freedom (which is unlisted under the track listing).<br />BTW, my copy of this CD has a different cover that what is shown on Amazon.com.  The cover shot contains photos shot by Paul via his \\"watch camera\\".<br />Bottom Line: Other than the sound of his vocals (which in some cases works - like on the more rockin' tracks - but not on the ballads), Driving Rain is a nice solid album with a lot of great tracks.
B00004RFFS|1.0|This dreary, interminable and wrong-footed attempt to modernize the vampire genre can only be justified by its homoerotic appeal, but even that must surely evaporate in the murky silliness of \\"Interview\\". Apart from anything else, the film violates the most important canon of horror literature: the \\"face\\" of the horror must never be portrayed or described, but only hinted at; its content comes from the imagination of the reader/viewer. And boy toys do not make plausible vampires at the best of times. Don't do this again.
B00006AW2G|5.0|'Let It Bleed' is one of those albums that is on every major \\"Best Albums Ever\\" sort of list. It is just that good. From start to finish, the album never loses its consistency. 'Gimmie Shelter' may be one of the best opening songs of all time. (but then again, there's also 'Sympathy For The Devil', and 'Miss You' to contend with). Then there's 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' to seal off the album. Any album that begins on 'Gimmie Shelter' and ends on 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' has to have something good in the middle, right? 'Midnight Rambler' is a bluesy romp about a serial killer, while 'Monkey Man' is an eerie drug tale with some vibrant, dark effects. This album doesn't house a single dud or dramatic misfire, it's the Rolling Stones in their creative peak. There isn't much to say about this landmark album that hasn't been said in other reviews, in magazines and this site. For those looking for a nice starting point, this album would be great. 'Forty Licks' is a decent collection with an enormous amount of hits (and misses), but that can't be a total substitute for the original albums.<br />*** The SACD is not a marketing scheme or a fraud. I own both the 'Let It Bleed' and 'Beggars Banquet' remasters and they both play fine on my computer. I was able to rip songs onto mp3s just fine too. (I don't even have a remarkably powerful or new computer either). I don't own a special DSD Sony cd player, but I find the sound quality to be clear enough on my computer and home stereo system. The negative comments lead me to believe that there is either a defect on the initial pressings of the cd (possible, but not likely) or certain CD-ROM drives can't read the disc (very possible), or maybe people are complete ... (most likely the case).
B000068IEU|1.0|This was the most boring movie I've ever purchased. It is slow and the criminals are both uninteresting and stupid. The movie seems to go on forever before anything, relating to the plot, even happens. Ther are some pretty gross effects in the movie, if you're into sausage filled [junk]. I can't honestly tel you how the movie ended because I turned it off and went to do some chores around the house instead. Believe me if I would rather work around the house then watch this movie then it [stinks].
0312305060|2.0|I read this book, based on its Pulitzer prize status and it being a feminist story, however, I was disappointed.  It was very well written and had a few lovely and poetic parts, but mostly it was full of unhappy, depressed, hopeless gay people who I could not sympathize with in any way.  They were either unable to accept and live with being gay or couldn't figure out how to get help or antidepressant meds.   I couldn't understand what was the point of all the angst and misery.  The theme seemed to be \\"life is hopeless and terrible, and if you are lucky, you may get a few good hours in a lifetime\\".  Very big downer.  I won't see the movie.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I haven't seen a movie, possibly in my entire life, that has given me chills from the first note to the last.  This movie has to be one of the best movies to have come out in a long time.  I've seen it twice, and its not even in wide release yet.  I've seen the musical on Broadway, and was left breathless afterward, and I was wary that the movie wouldn't be nearly as good as the musical, but to my pleasant suprise, it was.  Both good for different reasons, I highly recommend this movie.  The performances are superb and the sets and costuming lends a larger than life feel that leaves you wishing you were on Broadway to be a part of a production like this.  This movie cannot be missed, its amazing.
B000066NW0|5.0|Now everyone calls Avril a &quot;self-professed skater punk&quot;, and then chew her out, saying her music doesn't live up to her punk title.  But I haven't heard her call herself a punk even once.  I believe that music is self-expression, and this CD is how she choose to do so.  I believe Avril's whole point was to not be sterotyped into a certain category, which is what everyone has done.  As for her music, I found the songs to be catchy and entertaining while delivering wise words.  If you listen, I believe that &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; would show that you she believes that you should be comfortable the way you are.  And not to change for anyone.  Avril Lavigne is a real role-model with something valuable to say.  Unlike Britney Spears.
B00005AUBA|5.0|i have alot of cds... alot of alot of experimental, electronic, alot of dance, and alot of rock.<br />but... this maybe by far the most important album i own. granted, it may be short, but it is perfect. i heard someone complain about the \\"robot chant\\" track, but even that is brilliant. i used it as a transition on a dj set i made.<br />this is one of those albums that will go down in history as being extremely important. honestly, as some albums get older their sound gets dated... but never has their been a sound just like this. this album is sad, dark, melodic, and yet dissonant.<br />this album is surreal. it makes all other music seem BORING, and another thing about this album, even though it is short... i haven't tired of it yet. most of the time i get bored with an album after too many listens.. but \\"rock action\\" is just a familar friend now. this album and \\"CODY\\" are my favorites. come on die young is an extraordinary album but this one does far in the terms of emotion and fitting together as an album.
B00005R87Q|5.0|okay, let's accept this movie for what it is. it's a bunch of guys running around in fast and flashy cars. what did you expect?? deep, heartfelt, emotional moments??<BR>all I hear is that the acting is &quot;b&quot; rated, and I agree to a point. if you carefully listen to all that is said, the dialogue pretty much is exactly what any of us would say and how we would say it. <BR>in movies acting is generally over done. that's what keeps us interested. the people in the movies say and do things in ways people would never do in real life. if you listen to what the actors are saying in this movie, you'll notice that they use common, everyday words and voice tones. is it boring? relatively speaking, I guess it is. but it ads a bit of realism to it. it comes across as if you're not so much watching a movie as you are a fly on the wall; listening in on every-day people's conversations. am I the only one to notice this subtlety? <BR>I admit I found plenty of mistakes, from N20 lines scraping the ground, an engine that has &quot;direct-port nitrous injection&quot; as WELL as a &quot;fogger system&quot;, hearing how the guys isn't &quot;double clutching like you should&quot; (you double clutch when DOWN shifting or during heel/toe driving), floorboards that fall out of cars but suddenly reappear, etc. but who cares? it's not a DOCUMENTARY. <BR>I think the movie came across EXACTLY how it was intended. <BR>even with a few production mistakes and some non-conventional acting/dialogue/scripting I really enjoyed this movie. in fact I bought it and watch it nearly every week.
B00005OWEG|5.0|As a child, I was switching channels and found Apocalypse Now on TV.  I was blown away.  No other movie has so many layers and different ideas that blend togther coherently.  The images are beuatiful and I like the expanded version even better.  The extra scenes flesh out the characters even more and you learn more about them.  I like the french plantation scene as well.  It gave me more to think about and put the whole war over there in more of a perspective.  Having the doors song &quot;the end&quot;, which is one of my favorites, also adds to the mystical atmosphere of the film.  Buy this movie.  this is filmmaking at it's best.
0345357116|4.0|This book is an excellent resource for further background on Tolkien's world of Middle-earth. I did my senior research paper on JRR Tolkien and read several (i.e. twelve) books on Tolkien and his magnificent world of fantasy. I tend to steer clear of Christopher Tolkien's History of Middle-earth series because I have kept the mindset that Christopher's series is only a reverberation of the brilliancy of JRR, his father. Because this book is mostly composed of JRR Tolkien's works, I include it with the original tales of Middle-earth. Therefore it is surrounded by perfection. This is a great supplement to any Tolkien collection.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I have owned this CD now for over two months and am still trying to figure it out.  &quot;You were right about the stars, each one is a setting sun,&quot; just one example of clever lyricism and thoughtful reflections.  But exactly what songs like war on war mean aren't clear to me.  The steel guitar, atmosphere, jive of this album is great.  On first listen you hear magnificently created pop songs with a major groove.  But after a while you try and figure out what it means and it goes deeper than what you hear on the surface.  Heartbreak?  Courage? Making the best of life?  Hope?  Nostalgia?  Elements of these things are there, but  they are crafted in a way that makes you search it out and try to figure out what's going on.  All my lies are only wishes.  This is a fun album that goes deeper than the surface, and it is fun to dig into.  Check it out.
B00003CXBK|5.0|LISTEN HERE IVE SEEN MANY MOVIES THE GODFATHER, SCARFACE,ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA,HEAT,AND MANY MORE CLASSICS BUT THIS MOVIE EARNED MY RESPECT AN EXCELENT MOVIE AND TO ME A CLASSIC ONE EXTREAMLY WELL MADE NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITES
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have adored this movie ever since I frist saw it about 3 years ago. This is an enchanting epic story that has it all--action, adventure, romance, man against nature, and mythology. I showed this movie to my little brothers (8 and 11 at the time), and they couldn't get enough of it. I think every true anime fan owes it to themselves to see this movie at least once.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Jeff Tweedy and company created one of the most astounding records to date. This disc is really just phenomenal. Even thinking about writing a description of this disc that would really do it justice is almost absurd, but I will give it a shot. First I'd just like to say this is the best album of the year, and by far Wilco's best album. With Jim O'rourke, one of the best solo artists around, helping out with producing and adding his own flavor to the songs, everything works out flawlessly. The cd opener is a solid track, like all the rest of them, but the best tracks are Radio Cure, a beautiful piece exuding pathos, the upbeat and fuzzy War on War, and the saccharine pop tune, Heavy Metal Drummer. Fantastic cd, 10 stars.

B0000560X3|5.0|This is the all time Great! I use this album to check out systems from records, 8-track, cassette, stereo, quadraphonic, CD, DVD, and home theater. This album gets better as the technology that delivers it gets better. The only other ROCK Albums that I think could be used in the same way are Edgar Winter's &quot;They only come out at Night&quot; or Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.
B000002OX7|5.0|I can't believe this album is over 30 years old. It still sounds new and fresh. Every song is listenable, most are established classics. Get it.
0316666343|5.0|The book covers shocking ground, but with a difference.  We see brutality so frequently, but \\"The Lovely Bones\\" goes there with insight and, eventually, wisdom.  The narrator is believable and moving without appealing to any kind of sentimentality.<br />This was an odd kind of page-turner.  Yes, murder and danger lurked about (and the suspense was painful), but questions about heaven and grief were easily as gripping.
B00004YRQA|5.0|If you've played games such as \\"The Bouncer\\" you appreciate the memory card very much.  There are games that can't be beaten with out the use of this device, END OF STORY.  Even if you only play your PS2 one hour a week, a memory card will help you get farther give you a better gameing experience.  The amount of memory is no joke.  With 8 Mega bites, you can save files for well over a dozen games.<br />Bottom line, if own or want to own a PS2, you must have this item!

630503723X|3.0|There are several running times for this film according to the IMDb, but one thing I noticed about this DVD is that the transfer could have been done in the PAL European standard, which makes the film run faster by 4%, hence the shorter running time.  The UK DVD, which is censored by about 30 seconds runs 87 minutes, this Fox Lorber version is short of 86 minutes by less than 10 seconds.  The 2.35:1 transfer on the US disc looks soft and the film has its share of scratches, colors are mildly faded as well, certainly not an ideal presentation, but still a good deal at this price, especially since the title is already out of print.  These early Emmanuelle films will be reissued by another video company in 2003 as part of their &quot;Emmanuelle Collection&quot;.

B000002J23|4.0|I owned this back in the days of 8 tracks!  I listened to it about a million times, but I later forgot about it after the 8 track player died.  When I came across this cd recently, it reminded me how good this music is.  I don't think it matters who is playing in the band at the time, you don't need to think about it, 'cause this sounds like classic, rockin' YES!
0451167716|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of the Godfather films, but I have to say that reading the book the movies were based upon made me love the story even more. In many ways the book is better than the films (as incredible as that may seem) because the book gives more in-depth accounts about the characters. Unfortunately, \\"The Godfather\\" films could only do so much due to time constraints, so it was wonderful to get the full story behind the characters Francis Ford Coppola immortalized in his films.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a well-written, thought-provoking, and captivating book. Puzo not only romanticized the mafia, but also shows the power, violence, death, and reality that is associated with it as well.<br />If you loved the films, you will love this book even more!...
B0000025VU|2.0|This is a painfully average Dylan album. If you're new or fairly new to the great man, this is no place to start. There's one great song - Jokerman. Aside from that there are are 2 or 3 others that are worth listening to a few times: Sweetheart Like You, License to Kill and Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight. The rest is mediocre and second rate. If you're already familiar with a dozen of his classic and near-classic albums and want to fill in the gaps, then you should look into it. Non-essential Bob, this one. If you're looking for an introduction to 80s Bob, start with the much superior (but short of classic) No Mercy from 1989.
6305558167|5.0|If you love Knights and magic, action and adventure, sword and sorcery, you must have this movie. It has humor, drama, sex, violence and a mystical feel that thrusts you into a magical kingdom. With beautiful photography, this is the definitive tale of King Arthur, his wizard Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table. An awesome sound track accompanies the action and the characters are well defined. This is a must-have for anyone who appreciates the story of Camalot!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I usually dont like this kind of music, but the very first time I heard 'All the Things She Said' on the radio I wanted to know who sang it. But I didnt find out until I saw the music video. Its not your typical teen cheesy type of music. True, it is somewhat pop-sounding, but its original. The album is wonderful. Their voices are beautiful. You just have to be in the mood to accept something new, or at least give it a chance. Its a great deal for the price, as well. Its a great CD, its enhanced and it doesnt cost much. So you should stop being cheap and buy it ;)
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I was surprised at the difference in quality between the VHS and DVD versions. This one is bright and lovely to look at, and the songs, as always, are beautiful. The extra features are more imaginative than those usually accompanying animated features.  If you're torn over whether or not to upgrade your classic movies to DVD, take a look at the color quality on this DVD-the difference will make the decision for you!

B00005JKDR|3.0|Keep in mind that I'm 31 years old.  I didn't enjoy this movie nearly as much as many other Disney classics-something was just missing.  I didn't find any any of the main characters to be that funny or that charismatic, and the music wasn't even on the same level as Toy Story, although they tried very hard to duplicate the success of that movie and it's sequel.<br />However, I have to say that my 11-year-old and 20-month old adore this movie, and will watch it over and over again if I let them!
B00003CX8J|2.0|This movie was just OK. The special effects were excellent but that's all. The acting with the exception of Patrick Stewart was average. The plot was true to the comic book genre, in that it was simple and predictable. I hate to think that the future of movies lies simply in special effects created for the DVD audience and that the moviemakers forget that movies need believable plots and good acting to truly make a great movie.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I took my daughter to see this, and loved it so much that I bought it on DVD.  It's delightfully imaginative, the special effects are well done, and it's one of the few movies starring children that doesn't make you want to strangle the snotty little children's characters.  The casting in this was perfect, and we've watched it many times.  This will make any adult feel like a kid again!
B00005JL78|1.0|I really don't know what Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise thought they were doing in this movie. The lighting was too bright or overexposed. I suppose it was supposed to put me in mind of the future, but all it really did was annoy me. I had figured out who the bad guy was about 1 hour before the movie revealed it. And what about a little better attention to the details. How long did Cruise carry that pair of eyeballs with him and they hadn't deteriorated??? Now if he were such a big criminal, wouldn't they have shut down his access?????
B0000027RL|4.0|Now let's face it: Even though this album sold more copies than Nirvana's NEVERMIND, it had much less of an impact. However, it remains as second on the grunge horizon with songs like Jeremy and Alive. Although this record is a must-have for grunge fans, it has paved the way for some pretty ... music. Creed is a complete and utter failure of a copy of Pearl Jam. I don't recall the lead singers name, but he is not at all original; a complete Eddie Vedder copy. But let's not forget that these guys are still around (they recently put out another record called RIOT ACT) and the haven't sold themselves out to commercials, they aren't on television often, and they remain a symbol of what grunge ideas were. Even after the boy bands invaded our homes and ruined our lives, Pearl Jam stayed together. And in a day and age with no good grunge (... like Puddle of Mudd, Incubus, Linkin Park, Nikelback, etc.), they keep releasing records whether they sell or not. That's grunge.
B00005JKED|4.0|Mr. Wasington's performance was different and believable. His character is &quot;raw&quot; in every sense of the word.  It's a shame that he would have to play a &quot;dirty cop&quot; win to an Oscar over all the other work he has done. If you are into mayhem, this is the movie for you.

0792838068|5.0|\\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" is a dark and tragic film that shows you how low you can fall and just how bad things can get.  It portrays a dead-on picture of alcoholism and what exactly one goes through when they've hit rock bottom.  As tragic as it is, this is a very beautiful and well-done film that keeps your attention to the bitter end.<br />Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) is an alcoholic who has nothing left to live for but the very booze that seems to be the only happiness he can find.  His friends want nothing to do with him and women are disgusted by him.  After being let go from his job, Ben burns all of his possessions and moves to Las Vegas, where his only plan is to drink himself to death.  In a short amount of time he meets Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a lonely hooker who has been through it all.  An unexpected bond is formed between the two and love falls upon them that can only end in tragedy.<br />Boy, was this a hard movie to watch, but it was so well-done and executed.  You are able to sympathize with both Ben and Sera, despite the paths they have chosen.  Nicholas Cage was amazing and brilliant.  No wonder why he won an Academy Award for his performance.  You really buy into the fact that he is this sad character who wants nothing more but to destroy himself by the only thing that can bring him some sense of false happiness.  Shue is also terrific in her role and should be applauded as well.  The two are explosive as a team and can really bring the house down.<br />The DVD is fair; nothing too special.  You can have your choice of either watching the movie in widescreen or full screen.  The picture for the most part looks good; not the best, but good.  The main special feature this DVD offers is a trailer for the film and a bonus secret page.  It would be nice if they decided to re-release this in a more superior version.<br />\\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" is drama at its best.  It's heartbreaking, but at the same time is satisfying.  It's emotionally charged from start to finish.  The writing is poetic, the acting is electric, and the directing is fantastic.  Be warned, this is not a \\"feel-good\\" movie.  It's a portrait of harsh reality and it doesn't go easy on you for a second.  If you want a powerhouse drama that will keep you emotionally involved, this is the one for you.

0316666343|2.0|This book uses an unusual point of view as a perspective on a horrific event and its aftermath, but in the end, I felt like I was the one being manipulated. I looked forward to finishing this book more than any I've read recently, just so I could move on to something better.
B00000JXZ7|5.0|What a find this album is, or perhaps 'find' isn't the right word, being a blend of two previously released albums...a cherry-picking, if you will. In any case, Kyung's playing is moving and energizing in its ability to invigoriate both a warhorse like the Mendelssohn concerto and a rarer piece like Bruch's Scottish Fantasia. The Penguin Guide practically raves over this album, and rightfully so...it's a landmark piece worthy of collection by everyone from novice to jaded. The 24bit/96khz remastering does wonders for the sonics and, at htis price, there is no reason not to leap, grab, and add this to your collection.
B000002IU9|5.0|Manowar is looked upon as godly(the fans are hardcore, more than just about any group you can think of)or thought of as heavy metal's biggest joke.  This was my first taste of Manowar back in the day, and I was a little confused about it at first.  I wasn't sure if they were trying to be funny or not.  Well, since I got more into them over the years I know that these guys are dead serious about what they're doing.  They're music and image is extremely cornball, I would hope even the most hardcore fan could admit to seeing a bit of humor in it all.  But to me, that's all a part of what makes Manowar Manowar.  These guys are the epitome of male ma-cheese-mo;  I mean, they're the total embodiment of tough guy-Conan-badass-motorcycle riding-sexist-violent maleness taken to it's most extreme.  It makes you want to strip down to your undies and run about the house wielding an invisible sword while munching on a giant turkey leg.  And that's just the way they portray themselves.  But, for all of this braggadocio these guys really do know how to play, they're not all about image.  Eric Adams has one helluva voice though it sounds like he's straining too hard on the high notes.  When you listen to his raspy high pitched scream, you can just envision him with a blue face, veins bulging, on the verge of his head exploding.  That's a singer.  So, say what you want about them, but there's only one Manowar.  If you're curious, it wouldn't hurt to give this album a spin.  I would think most heavy metal fans will get something out of Manowar, even if it is only a good laugh.  I think you'd have to be a real stiff to wholeheartedly say that you \\"hate\\" them, but there are certainly many out there who do.  However, there isn't one group in existence that isn't hated by someone somewhere.  So, give these guys a shot;  For better or worse, you'll always remember them.
1574535153|5.0|I listen to audio books everyday while I drive to and from work. Some readers are better than others but the &quot;team reading&quot; done on Speaker for the Dead is phenomenal. This book is a complex and entirely engrossing story of Ender Wiggins (and the sequel to Ender's Game). Ender is not longer a boy, but a man who has travelled from world to world in search of a place to settle and allow the rebirth of the &quot;buggers&quot;. He ends up on a strange plant inhabited by the only other alien species known - the piggies.<br />This book is layer upon layer of social impacts based on culture, religion, family, love, science... very deep in places, very imaginative in its sci-fi appeal. An excellent reading/listening experience.
B000001GQP|5.0|First, I would like to say that I don't know anything regarding classical or opera terms, and that I'm writing this review as your average Joe who loves music.  Ok, with that said, I highly recommend this CD.  I first saw the Trans Siberian Orchestra perform O Fortuna live, and since that moment I became obsessed with finding the perfect recording.  I've read a lot of reviews from both musicians and collectors, and this was ranked very high (with few exception like you'llfind with Amazon[.com] reviews).  Furthermore, Carl Orff himself has approved this album.  What more do you need.  It's performed as he intended.  I would also like to add that I was never a big fan of Opera style music, but his style is so unique that you can't help but love it.  More so, the lyrics are actual poems from real people who lived hundreds of years before Carl applied the music.  There is true history and meaning in the words (if you can understand Latin).  Please, do yourself a favor and buy this album.  It's worth it, especially for the price listed.

B00005JLWL|3.0|I saw this movie with four friends of mine, and we all left the theater with vastly different opinions about it. Though we all agreed that the action scenes were incredibly done, I found them out of place in this film. The premise regarding a world free of emotion, if executed better, could've been interesting, but, by the end, \\"Equilibrium\\" left me unconvinced about its points.<br />Christian Bale plays John Preston, a law enforcement officer who goes about assuring that everyone in society is without emotion. The society controls the emotional responses of its people through drugs and use of the martial arts. (The martial arts in the film, used with guns in a stunning, if bafflingly incoherent, provide its best effects.) Preston, over time, begins skipping his treatments, though he's initially a stalwart in favor of the old system.<br />As he develops emotions, in scenes that aren't quite convincing because actors pretending not to convey emotions come off as wooden (whether or not it's a plot device), Preston begins fighting the establishment, caring for his kids and caring for his old partner's lover, a renegade art-lover played by Emily Watson. (I'm not entirely sure if this is supposed to be some sidebar love story, for it's hard to be convinced when Christian Bale doesn't play up emotions in this, or any, regard.)<br />The movie lost me with its use of the cute puppy dog. Bale finds that, with emotions, he can't shoot the poor thing in the head, even though it's required of his job. Instead of shooting the dog, though, he guns down about 15 men trying to kill the dog. Where's the emotion and morality in that? One cute dog we can't kill, but let's violently dispatch a whole bunch of people because they don't have emotions and want to kill us. It's weirdly uneven, and the scene of him gunning down the people, then embracing the furry creature and crying is just silly.<br />Don't waste your time. Though it's action-packed and sorta has a moral point to it, it's unconvincing.unconvincing.

B000007MVU|3.0|&quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; was Ringo Starr's first solo project, actually begun in late 1969 (i.e., before the Beatles officially imploded).  To the surprise of everyone this was not a collection of rock 'n' roll but rather a trip down memory lane with standards from the 1930s and 1940s that Ringo's mum and dad preferred to the music that made Richard Starkey world famous (remember, he was also the oldest of the Fab Four).  In the grand tradition of having a little help from his friends, the songs Ringo sings were arranged by everyone from George martin and Paul McCartney to Quincy Jones, Elmer Bernstein and Maurice Gibb.  However, the songs simply do not play to Ringo's strengths and you will hear by listening to just about any song on the album; &quot;You Always Hurt the One You Love&quot; would be the exception that proves the rule, but then it is the song that comes closest to the fun little songs Ringo got to sing with the Beatles.  Contrast that with &quot;Night and Day&quot; or &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; and the difference is palatable.<br />If fans thought &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; a strange cup of tea from Ringo then his other 1970 album, &quot;Beaucoups of Blues,&quot; with its country western songs must have made them wonder what was coming next.  But there is actually a key common denominator for both albums in that these musical genres focus on the vocalist, and whatever else you might say about Ringo he was a most distinctive vocalist.  &quot;Beaucoups&quot; is the better of the two albums, which is not surprising given Ringo's comfort with country and western music was established way back when he recorded &quot;Act Naturally.&quot;
B00007FOMP|5.0|From the cover of the album to the last note, this is a perfectly realized work.  The songs are haunting, rhythmic, political, sexy, and devout all at once.  It sums up its time, but it also timeless.<br />If you're reading this and don't know the album, you'd probably think I was brainwashed or something.  <br />Then listen to the album, and you'll feel the same way.<br />A must for every serious music afficionado.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I'm not going to go into too much detail in my review, because I think that some of the other reviewers here have covered the feel of this show beautifully. Deep Space Nine is what the Trek producers are still searching for now: an intriguing space adventure taking place in everyone's favorite sci-fi universe with a different structure and feel. <br />The pilot episode, The Emissary, is all one needs to have a sense of things to come in this series: a sense of intrigue, conflict on the personal level and on a much broader scope, and mystical / thological themes that were always absent from prior Treks. The brilliance is that, with all these noted differences, they were still able to keep the sense of wonder and exploration intact that the Original Series had.<br />Aiding this was not only strong writing, but excellent characters with depth and motivation behind their actions. The actors playing these characters are also quite good. Avery Brooks' Captain Sisko is a commanding and complicated man, much in the way that Picard was, but also very different. He is a tortured and confused presence when we first meet him, and the show is really a story of his rediscovery of himself and what he holds most dear. As much as I love the classic heroes of Kirk and Picard, I find Sisko more interesting and realistic than either (Kirk's still my hero though).<br />If people are looking for an intricate and intellegent science fiction series with a great continuing story arc and characters that are wonderfully brought to life, this is a great show for you. And, as I've recently found...it only gets better with repeat viewings.

B00005JL96|5.0|This is the cutest Disney movie I have seen in a long time. Stitch and Lilo have the most unique characters and their combination makes for a great movie. The look of the aliens is so......not human its funny. Having one of them dress up as a woman was very funny. When my sister and I saw the two of them fighting over the wig, we laughed our heads off. Definetly a good movie for those young at heart and even a few otherwise. If you need a good laugh, watch Lilo and Stitch.

B000068TPN|4.0|This is one occasion, where your initial experience is expanded and improved by a simple little behind-the-scenes info. I saw the movie, and though it was a well-done, but standard war flick.<BR>Then I saw the short featurette, and replayed the movie in my head.<BR>The &quot;you are there&quot; quality of the gunplay attracts the most attention, but the little moments, like the taxi delivering the telegrams, are the ones that'll haunt you.<BR>The cast is as good as you'd expect, but again, this movie is made in the details, not in the plot or the dialogue. In that respect, it's made exceedingly well.
0066214122|3.0|I've read several of MC's books and enjoyed all of them to various degrees. Prey introduces us to a very likable main character and gives us another one of Crichton's famed runaway science experiments. As usual, the technogy described is cutting-edge and well explained. I was able to easily follow how it developed and evolved.<br />Everything was great up until about page 300 (out of 360). <br />It felt as the last part of the book was a Hollywood movie and the two hour flick was nearing its end. The book went from being intelligent and scary in a very real sense, to being an over-the-top popcorn movie with generic action. Maybe it would have been better if the ending came more as a surprise. I had pretty much figured out the twist ealier in the book, so the ending wasn't that exciting to me.  My wife on the other hand was blown away by those events and enjoyed it more than I did.<br />All in all, this is one of Mr. Crichton's better books but definitely not his best. I consider it a good read and look forward to the movie that I'm sure will follow.

0316666343|1.0|Geez - what a book.  The only reason I finished it was it was selected by a book club I belong to.  What a piece of slop! And the point of it was_____? You tell me.  Move over Jonathan Edward, Alice Sebold is leaving you in her wake....What a pointless exercise.
014028009X|5.0|A friend loaned this to me, and I was a little cynical about it in the beginning.  I'm not one who usually likes books written as diary enteries, so I'd always passed this one over.  Now, five readings later, I love it and laugh outloud every time I read it.  I love the sequel even more, and I find that the remake of Jane Austen's plots are hidden well enough in the story that you don't know for sure how it will all come out.  Love Bridget, love this book.
6304458304|5.0|This movie has a lot going on and juggles them all very well. You have the intrigue of a Presidential assassin, the Secret Service (which you rarely see movies about), aging agents, small-time office romance. It changes rapidly and makes for a very enjoyable viewing. The cinematography is good, especially considering the environment, the transfer, sound and editing are very good. This definitely makes for a good Friday or Saturday evening flick.

0060977264|3.0|While reading the book, I thought Coelho spent too much time deliberately clouding the plot with his character's musings and rambling state of mind, but then I remembered that I was reading a translation of a Latin author's work -- it is exceedingly difficult to transmit the Latin mindset easily into English, as anyone who's read a work in Spanish or Portuguese followed by its English translation knows.  When I have time, I'd like to read the novel in Spanish to see if it rings truer, although I don't know if the Portuguese-to-Spanish translation is any less difficult.  I could learn Portuguese, I guess, but I'm too lazy.<br />I can't say I came away from reading this book spiritually enriched, but I will confess to having had an unusual depth to my thoughts while reading it.  While there may or may not have been a link, it's enough to get me to read another Coelho novel sometime in the future.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis is my favorite band, hands down.  I have a particular bias for them as a lot people do for their favorite band.  I don't think I need to show any bias when I tell you about (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (WTSMG).  This is without a doubt the definitive rock album of the past 20 years.  Forget U2's Joshua Tree, Radiohead's The Bends, and Nirvana's Nevermind.  WTSMG is what rock 'n roll is all about.  From the amazing cover artwork to the last few drum beats in \\"Champagne Supernova\\", WTSMG is a celebration of life.  Oasis have released some good albums over the years, and even as a big Oasis fan as I am, I don't love all their music.  There are some songs which should have been on albums instead of being a B-side, but that's life, and life is not always fair.  WTSMG is squeaky clean, the production absolutely magic, and the love ballads and the hard rockers all have a life of their own.  It all starts with \\"Hello\\", with a little help from an old Gary Glitter tune.  \\"Hello\\" is thunderous, and from here the album hits the ground running.  \\"Roll With It\\", Track 2 is still one of the most popular arena favorites and here the loud rock music with guitar layers continue.  Now slow down...and take a deep breath.  Enter \\"Wonderwall\\", Heart-Melting Love Ballad Number 1.  \\"Wonderwall\\" is so utterly perfect that Oasis have yet to top it.  From Liam's sweet and sincere vocals to Noel's guitar, and the sad sigh of the violins, the song is truly, hauntingly beautiful.  \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\", Heart-Melting Love Ballad Number 2.  Noel takes the driver's seat in this one, and delivers one of the best vocal performances ever.  His voice is something to lo and behold, and right on par with little brother Liam.  The John Lennon \\"Imagine\\" intro is a tribute, not a ripoff.  There is NOTHING wrong with paying homage to your heroes.  Next comes \\"Hey Now!\\", and it's an in-betweener.  Soft vocals and loud guitars but they work well together.  Next is a small interlude from the \\"Swamp Song\\" sessions, and it's an instrumental that leads into \\"Some Might Say\\", the hardest rocking and most upbeat track in WTSMG, and another true masterpiece.  The pace slows for \\"Cast No Shadow\\", Noel's dedication to fellow singer/songwriter Richard Ashcroft of the now defunct Verve.  \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is a sad ballad about the struggles of an artist such as Noel and Richard, and it delivers.  \\"She's Electric\\" is next, and it's a bouncy, lighthearted tune, Liam's vocals are noticeably nice in this one too.  \\"Morning Glory\\" is Track 10 and the title track, and the fastest song on WTSMG - the helicopter intro is amazing.  Track 11 is another \\"Swamp Song\\" interlude, leading into \\"Champagne Supernova\\", the magnum-opus of WTSMG, the album enders of album enders.  \\"Champagne Supernova\\" touches so many people, at so many social, economic, and emotional levels, that it has become a timeless song.  Radios still play \\"Champagne Supernova\\" and one can't help but think of the good ol' early and mid 90's when good music was king, and the garbage of today was non-existant.  Face it, today's music lacks passion, it really does, and mainly because a lot of today's top artists (I use the term very, very loosely) don't even write their own music, which means the music isn't from the heart, the mind, the body, and the soul.  I'm almost 20 years old now, and I listen to the likes of Floyd, Zeppelin, and other classic rock acts and as well as modern rock wonders such as Oasis, Verve, and matchbox twenty, so you really can't call me an ignorant teenager with a bias for only modern rock music.  I know my music, and I know good music when I hear it, and I take great pride in that.  So next time you go browsing and perusing through your local CD store for a CD, pick up \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\".  One of the few albums I would take with me to a stranded island.
0446677450|3.0|I can't say much for the readability of the book -- it is poorly written and poorly edited.  But Kiyosaki does make a good point -- most of us are pretty good at managing to stay in debt and one step ahead of the tax man most of our lives.  Saving and financial investment are fine, but the real key to wealth is to buy assets that appreciate in value, and, ideally, throw off a revenue stream.  Probably easier said than done (or we'd all be rich) but this is a bit of financial advice one doesn't receive under normal circumstances.  Not a classic, but worth the time to browse through some rainy afternoon.
0151008116|3.0|I am a farmer, not a book critic, so I may not appreciate and understand all of the potential subtleties and symbolism of this novel.  I certainly do not understand the heaps of praise given to this book.  Nevertheless, I will attempt to give my brief opinion, which differs from most others, and risk receiving many \\"not helpful\\" votes.<br />The Life of Pi is clearly a good book, but it is not a great work.  At the beginning of the book, the author reminds the reader of the many religious faiths and beliefs by introducing several characters.  In one great act of discontinuity, these characters are discarded as Pi journeys to Canada.  At this point, we must suspend disbelief, as we are asked to accept many highly unlikely events.  Such events include the unexplained opening of the animal cages before the ship abruptly sinks, 450-lb tiger crawling effortlessly into a 26-foot lifeboat, the flesh-eating island, the chance head-on meeting with a freighter and another castaway, the small lifeboat remaining upright for 200+ days in the open seas, etc.  I'm willing to accept these improbabilities if the story is entertaining and meaningful, but the survival story becomes quickly mired in details and drags on for far too many pages.<br />If you become bored with the lengthy tiger survival story, just skip ahead to Part III and the author will very clearly spell out the meaning of the book.  We are told that the tiger survival story may indeed be fantasy, and we are provided with a brief alternative, which is more probable.  Lacking any definite proof, as with religion, we are left to choose the \\"better\\" story; however \\"better\\" is not defined.  Better in terms of what?  that which offers better rewards?  that which makes you feels better?  that which is most probable and does not insult reason?  I can't abandon the latter in favor of the former.  In short, Martel uses far too many pages to make such a simple point.
B00007JMCX|5.0|So... will this be the original uncut version I saw in the theatre? Or will this be the butchered version that's missing nearly 30 minutes of footage? I never bought the previously available DVD because I assumed it was the censored version -- was I right or wrong??
B00005QGAT|5.0|When I was younger, I was a huge Michael Jackson fan. I would ONLY listen to Michael Jackson albums for the longest time. When History came out, my parents even bought me a copy on Father's Day, even though it should have been a day to celebrate my my father being a father. <br />However, Michael was not in to form at all on History. The new songs were pretty bad; not the catchy hooks and melodies of his work in the 1980s. When his marriage from Lisa Marie Presley came to an end, and his frequent use of surgical masks in public became known, Michael just became way to strange for my liking. Sure he did become white and had an stream endless cosmetic surgery before, but he was still 'fairly' normal by comparison.<br />Michael then released his newest album, Unbreakable. In my opinion this album was terrible. Whereas his earlier work was the kind of thing that revolutionised music, Unbreakable simply was more of the same ol' same ol' hip-pop influenced R & B of the late 20th Century. Nothing at all worthwhile.<br />With the controversy about his wierd up-turned nose and giant eyes (doesn't he look like Helena Bonham Carter as seen in Planet of the Apes?), it seemed to me strange that this freaky, pale looking shell of a man was once a young African-American superstar who won so many awards and sold so many albums.<br />I remembered listening to a tape Dad had made in his youth of Off The Wall. I really liked it then and it sounded different so some of his later work; more disco-pop, more soul, less rock and less overly-played tracks.<br />Listening to MP3s to check out how it sounded, I found that besides to obvious Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, She's Out oF My Life and Rock With You, this album is absolutely brilliant. Michael has never sounded as good; ever facet of his voice from a low growl to a high falsetto can be heard in full flight on this album. Lesser known album tracks are actually better than some of his later hits. Side one of the original LP is the more up-tempo disco side of things. Workin' Day and Night is one of his best danceable tracks ever recorded and the title track is my personal favourite from side 1. <br />An early sign of the Girl is Mine balladry Michael and Paul McCartney would recorded on Thriller is a more low-key Girlfriend, a nice pop song  that starts the slower side 2. Next comes one of Michael's most soulful tracks; She's Out of My Life. You can hear the sadness in his voice near the end, making it one of his most sincere songs. Next comes a song by my man Stevie; passing the torch to Michael in the form of I Can't Help It. The final track of the album, Burn this Disco Out, brings the album to an up-tempo and spirited finale.  <br />I actually purchased this album for a friend, but after listening to it in full, I just could not see myself owning a fake copy. I had to have the real thing, so I kept it for myself. The album has not been tarnished by time and by the very nature of it being recorded before Thriller, the album is a more rewarding listen since these songs are his neglected masterpieces. This is definately my favourite of his albums, his most soulful and stylish. He is not just trying to make pop music as he does with his later albums, it is a legitimate Disco-Soul album. A special mention must be made to producer Quincy Jones who really produced a timeless gem with this classic. This is truly something both he, Michael and Rod Temperton should view as their crowning achievement as a collaborative team.
078322947X|2.0|This is one of those movies that will forever suffer comparisons to the original. I saw it on it's original release and have never forgotten it's very stirring images. I have waited a long time to get a worthwhile home video version, but this DVD is not it. For a start they should of released a widescreen version. Even though it was shot in 1:1.66 (not 1:1.33 as someone said) ratio as lots of films are it was obviously not intended to be shown, theatrically at least, in that ratio. Hopefully Universal will return to this film someday and give us a restored anamorphic widescreen Special Edition.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Don't be fooled by the fact that this movie is long, starts in the middle of the story and has several significant changes to the original book's plot:  it is still an excellent movie - one of the best movies of all time (certainly one of the best sequels of all time).<br />First, in response to those who have read the books before and were upset by the changes made in the movies: I first read Tolkien's books when I was thirteen and have loved them ever since.  However, devoted as I am to them, I still love Peter Jackson's movie adaptations in spite of the changes he has made to them.  The simple reason is this:  THE MOVIES ARE NOT THE BOOKS!  If you want to get the original story straight from Tolkien's pen and imagine it in exactly YOUR own way, then read the book.  The simple fact is that when movies are made, one person's (or in the case of this movie, many persons') vision about that book becomes reality.  Some changes are made, but that doesn't mean the movie is bad, it just means that it is a different piece of art from the book, and that difference in and of itself isn't a bad thing. I will make this concession:  I found the changes to Faramir's character a little jarring as well, but I don't think that's any reason to reject the whole movie.  We haven't seen the end of this trilogy yet, and it seems a bit premature to reject the whole series because of one questionable addition.  Besides, considering all the things that Peter Jackson got RIGHT (Gandalf, Frodo, Eowyn, the Balrog, Galadriel, Grima Wormtounge, etc., etc., etc. - could you make cooler armor or weapons or scenery than they did, or pick better actors?) let's give the man a break.<br />This movie is excellent, as was the first.  The Lord of the Rings as a whole is one of the finest tales ever written and is admirably retold by Peter Jackson and all those who worked on it.  The one thing that this story has that shines out the most is that it is a tale of passion and friendship, hope and nobility in a world full of darkness and apathy and fear.  Those central themes shine out in these movies, and for that and for their beauty as films I think they will go down in history as some of the best movies ever made.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave's debut disc was well worth the wait. Good for us that the rumors, that this band was going to self-implode before it got out of the studio, were not true. Most people know by now that Audioslave is made up of former Soundgarden front man Chris Cornell, along with Rage Against the Machine minus Zack de la Rocha.<br />I wasn't sure if this combination would work. But once I heard Cochise, the first single, I was converted. Even though I've practically wore out my copy of Superunknown, I forget how Cornell could wail. Man, he's got a set of lungs. I rate his vocals right up there with Maynard of Tool and Vedder. Just something about them screams rock. Mix this in with Morello, Commerford, and Wilk's bass-heavy rock, and presto - kick ... rock and roll.<br />If you're tired of all the so-called rock bands out there today who are either too pop or too poser for your tastes, buy this album. It rocks.
B000001F9N|3.0|I am in no way a dance music fan. Never have been, probably never will be. Most of it grates on my nerves in ways I cannot describe.  However, I am a Donna Summer fan. Like a lot of my favorite singers past and present (Natalie Cole, Peabo Bryson, Mary J. Blige, Kenny Lattimore) she has a powerful, veratile instrument. You buy a Donna Summer record for the beat and the voice. The first side of the album (or first half on CD) is a wonderful, sexually charged dancefloor opus.  \\"Try Me,\\" \\"I Know\\" and \\"We Can Make It\\" blend to make \\"Try Me I Know We Can Make It,\\" a real disco stomper.  I'm surprised this wasn't a bigger hit single than it was.  The arrangement is catchy, with dips and loops that hold your attention but don't go to far out in left field.  Donna starts in her hushed falsetto and is in full voice by the end, building to a climax.  Good Stuff.  The other side kind of loses steam.  \\"Could Be Magic\\" is just average (a Barry Manilow work)  and some ho-hum ballads make for a somewhat weak ending.  Nontheless, this overall is a good album, and hints at the great things to come from Donna Summer.
B00006RIO7|4.0|There is no arguement that this movie was phenomenal. The soundtrack, while perhaps not the strongest part of the movie, is also amazing. It is quite apparant that Catherine Zeta-Jones is a theater vet, that Queen Latifah is a singing star, and that Richard Gere is just a natural talent. Renee Zellweger, however, is SO disappointing. It is so obvious that she hasn't had any previous singing training or experience. Her voice is weak, throaty, and nasal. She wouldn't last two seconds on a stage. (A number of the songs were even transposed into a higher key from the original score in order to accommodate her.) She especially pales in comparison to the gusto and belt quality of Catherine Zeta-Jones. <BR>Just a note:<BR>The movie crew took a new approach to the role of Roxie, portraying her as a sweet, innocent 'little girl.' The character is written (and done on Broadway) as a conniving, clever, manipulative temptress who is playing everyone in order to get her way. If you have only seen the movie, it is probably hard to imagine. I highly recommend both the original (1975) and revival (1997) Broadway soundtracks. Both were released in 1997 and feature, respectively: Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera, and Ann Reinking and Bebe Neuwirth.<br />-written by a veteran of the role of Roxie
B00005JL2O|5.0|I am a big Austin Powers fan as well as probably a million or more other people. I have to say that this installment in the series was not the best. The plot was pretty non-existent and the movie jumped around alot from scene to scene. That's not to say that the movie was a complete disaster. The movie was actually still quite funny, especially the one-liners(i.e.-\\"Doctor Evil, I used to think you were crazy, but now I can see your nuts.....I thank you\\") All I have to say is Mini Me in the prison scene.....frickin hilarious! Goldmember was pretty disgusting with his toight pants on and his skin problems. Oh, save me from myself yes. hahaha Anyway, this movie still ended up being pretty funny despite some of it's shortcomings. Another thing is that Fat Bastard just isn't as funny this time around. Furthermore, what happened to Austin's camera? I missed that in the movie-\\"Make an interconnected series of tunnels like the Vietcong.........and I'm spent.\\" This movie did miss a few of the elements that made the first two in the series so good, but all in all I still love this movie. I give it an A, just for its zanyness(is that a word?).
B00007BH5C|4.0|This album, as great as it is in its content and depth, can in no way topple the originality and warmth of its predecessor. Indeed, TTT's soundtrack's mimicking of many of the themes in the Fellowship's soundtrack has almost caused it to not be considered for an oscar.<BR>All in all however, it has a few songs that truly stirs the heart strings. The Rohan Irish theme is extremely well done and stirring. As well as are some of the darker, heavy melodies that are mixed in.
0783235380|3.0|The concept was great placing this unlikely pair together.  Individually they both have charimsa.  They could not escape a movie that wasn't that bad on paper, but bad, very bad in execution.  What should have been funny scenes were left a bit hollow.  The scene where he is undressing in a gay man's club should have been funny, it wasn't.  Both stars in their own right are very good.  An inplausible plot, just makes it difficult to carry on.  One bright spot in this film was some very creative camera work.  Personally this is worth watching on TV if it just happens to come on, but unless you are a fan of ether Ben or Sandra I would pass on this one.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is a truely amazing and magical movie and most people wonder why. It makes you feel good inside. Forrest Gump makes his way into all of our hearts by weaving himself into real American events so that we can relate to him. An innocent man sitting on a bench telling the story of his life. He may not be all there, but he touches all of our hearts. The music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on. It tells the tale of a man's life, and how he changed America. Tom Hanks brings so much to the role of Forrest, being able to express many emotions and feelings. The DVD is really good, great everything. I wouldn't even think about complaining at all. Forrest Gump is a role model for all things good, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.
B000002VCW|5.0|I had the pleasure to see Al in Chicago on Jan. 18, 2003 @ Schuba's Tavern.  It was just him and his guitar.  At first I thought &quot;he needs a whole band&quot; but once he started it was unbelievable. (He's a very accomplished guitar player).  Anyway, getting back to the YOTC CD every song is a winner.  This is the debut album, I remember buying it in 1976 on 8 track tape.  Al has such a unique voice and song writing style.  His melodies and words tell stories that you can picture in your mind.  The song YOTC is a masterpiece along with Lord Grenville, and of course On The Border.  If your a beginning Al Stewart fan this would be the CD to start with.
B000002NIW|5.0|This album is unbelievable! I would have to say that the Deftones are the Beatles in terms of Hard Rock, no other band in their genre comes remotely close.  Buy this album!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|From the opening credits, that take place as you are zooming out of a garbage bin, to the very final blast of the movie, you are hypnotized into the world of its lead Edward Norton who flawlessly plays the down, dull, depressed and lonely insomniac. His disoriented thoughts leads you through a trail of helpless explorations in the world of dark dumbing depression. People with insomnia are bound to find bliss watching Norton carry out his hallucinative journey. He begins attending sessions for terminally diseased patients speaking out. One day, he meets this very well dressed, well spoken, and handsome man named Tyler Durden. He sells soap for a living. The two hit it off and literally hit it off every night in the streets. Other dysfunctionally miserable men of society join in and the two form an underground cult they call fight club. <BR>Okay, I'm not going to get into details as to what happens next...but the story's got so much hidden secrets. The movie will end leaving you in complete awe and you'd want to watch it again!<br />The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed. And the stylish directing of David Fincher, the genius behind Se7en, brings back the noir-ish grizzly theme of his previous and present films back to your own viewing pleasure.<br />This movie is highly recommended. This DVD is a must-have.
0790749998|5.0|This video was pretty good, but Jet Li and Aaliyah wasn't quite the Romeo and Juliet type. The emotional feelings between them, were not as convincing as I would have expected. But the fact that Jet Li was labeled romeo, fit the character he portrays. He was a perfect gentleman with Aaliyah. Both Aaliyah and Jet Li had only one thing in common, and that was finding out who killed each of their brothers. Jet Li became a one man army against the thugs who killed his brother and Aaliyah's brother. The Action of Jet Li's martial art is a must see.
B000002MY3|4.0|Alanis Morissette's 1995 album that began a neverending thread of crazy girls everywhere growing their hair really long, picking up guitars and pouring their craziest thoughts out in the form of a rock song. Jagged Little Pill exceeds in its versatility. Whether its just a little bit crazy, &quot;Right Through You&quot;, or bizarrely crazy, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, Alanis pitches the ball too fast for your bat to swing at!<BR>But where the album really find its resting spot is in the lower pitch songs such as 'Hand In My pocket' and 'Ironic', two of the most outstanding songs written in the past quarter century. 'You Learn', 'Not The Doctor' and the hidden track 'Your House' are excellent examples of ideal songwriting.<br />What's more inspirational about Jagged Little Pill is the fact that Alanis was a teenybopper before taking the leap into real musicianship. More or less, she is the female version of Robbie Williams, or vice versa.<br />Recommended

B000075BFK|5.0|Back to that West Coast, gangsta sh**.  Pac is at his best once again on this album.  A mixture of blazing lyrics and soft flow.  I thought about this album, Gods Son, Last Temptation, and Blueprint 2 when buying my last album and this is the best choice.  Gods Son is the only one close.  Definitely worth your money.  Highlighted with the tracks \\"Still Ballin\\" (hott with Trick Daddy), \\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\" (gangsta w/ tight beat), \\"Street Fame\\", \\"Thugz Mansion\\" (both versions), \\"Never Call U B***h Again\\", \\"Better Dayz\\", and \\"Military Minds\\".  More clues on this album that he is alive.  This September makes 7 years.  Get ready.  <BR>Expect him.

B00005JL78|5.0|People can say what they want to about this movie, but it has to be one of Steven Spielberg's best ever. The way he depicts the future seems so dead on, that you have to believe our cars will look like that someday. WIth all the amazing graphics and what not, I would have to say that this is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. I know people who say he should not be an action star, but I would have to differ. With the right director and screenwriter, Tom Cruise can definitely be an action star. This movie had me on the edge of my seat at all times, watch it and you won't regret it.

B00005JKZT|5.0|I know that I'm committing some sort of sacrilege, but I was one of the few people on the planet Earth who thought that Peter Jackson's first film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was good but not great.  The pacing felt rushed, Pippin and Merry (close friends--almost family actually--of Frodo) were reduced to the hobbit equivalent of Beavis and Butthead.  Arwen, super-elf, made a brave stand at the ford instead of Frodo (I'm all for improving Arwen's character, but I still don't understand why Frodo's confrontation against the black riders was robbed from him; after all, Frodo shows something about himself in this scene).  All in all, the Tolkien purist in me thought, \\"Ugh!\\"<br />That said, I'm surprised that some purist reviewers are taking shots at The Two Towers.  For my money, the Two Towers felt more in line with Tolkien's vision than the first film.  The first 90 minutes are superb.  Rohan and its inhabitants feel \\"dead on,\\" and there are certain moments--such as when Gandalf saves Theoden--that feel just right.  Gollum is surprisingly well-rendered.  He's the first CGI character that I felt something for.  Even Treebeard looks sharp!<br />Some will take issue with Jackson's changes, and I can understand this, but his changes didn't feel as arbitrary or damning as those made in the first film (Arwen rescuing Frodo, Aragorn \\"letting\\" Frodo escape, etc.).  There's really only one serious change made in the Two Towers: Faramir.<br />In the book, Faramir is the mirror opposite of his brother Boromir.  Whereas Boromir lusted after the ring to his death, Faramir shows maturity and vision by divining that Frodo and Sam are on a serious mission and letting them go.  Jackson has taken some liberties here, making Faramir something of a villain.  Fans have been outraged.  To me, I didn't care much for the change, but unlike Arwen's rescuing of Frodo in Fellowship (which I still don't understand), Faramir's change felt a bit more reasonable.  After all, film is a different medium than the printed page, and it would be difficult to capture the subtlety of Faramir and Frodo's dialogue as Faramir slowly figures things out.  Instead, Jackson has to signal things to the average viewer, and I can understand this.  In essence, Jackson exaggerates Faramir's revelation by casting him as the villain who slowly learns what his brother Boromir could not.  Yes, I too wondered why the hell the hobbits were being dragged to Gondor.  Yes, I too wondered to myself, \\"What the hell is Jackson doing?\\"  Overall, though, I'd say it's a palatable change.<br />It's palatable because so much of the film works well.  Whereas Fellowship felt rushed to me (the film could have been titled \\"The Fellowship of the Ring's Greatest Hits\\"), The Two Towers revels in its \\"middle book\\" stance.  Are there negatives?  Well, sure.  Treebeard's scenes with Merry and Pippin feel shortchanged, which is too bad because I was really nervous about Treebeard coming across as cheezy, but I now think he deserved *more* screen time.  There's a 15-minute lull where Arwen and Elrond are shown in flashbacks, and although I respect Jackson's decision to flesh out the Aragorn-Arwen love story (which Tolkien surprisingly ignored, even though--as Tolkien geeks know--Arwen is the only elf (save Luthien) to sacrifice immortality for love), these scenes really drag down the film.  I'd love to say to Jackson, \\"Hey, man, I see what you're trying to do, and it's noble, but it just ain't working.\\"  Lastly, Aragorn's falling over a cliff during and orc/warg battle feels forced.  Not only does it ring as Hollywood action cliche, but we've already seen Gandalf reappear from the depths of death.  We don't want to see this same trope echoed via Aragorn.<br />Still, the positives outweight the negatives.  The Two Towers is a stronger picture than the first film and is actually more honest to the books--at least in terms of feel and rythym an pace.  Here's hoping that the Return of the King can continue the trend.
0312305060|5.0|This is truly a fine work by this author. There's just this for consolation: an hour here or there when our lives seem, against all odds and expectations, to burst open and give us everything we've ever imagined.... Still, we cherish the city, the morning; we hope, more than anything, for more. We cant ask for any more from this author. This book was written exceptionally well for its time and relevance to our society. There are none like it in the world. Dreams gateway to the self is also another book that has given me a newfound respect for life. Check them both out at Amazon.com.
B00005RRYS|5.0|I really enjoyed this cd when I first heard it, but I wanted the videos and the extra stuff which is great by the way!!  I highly recommend this cd to all Dido fans, but if you can I would try and find this cd cheaper as I did!!!
B00003CXA3|5.0|I have bought this DVD last year and I have to say that it is one of the best action movies I've seen! Excellent story and fascinating actors! Hackman and Scheider did an amazing job in this movie.   This DVD should be added to your collection, buy it now.  I recommend \\"The Conversation\\" too, a well underrated movie in the 70's, Gene Hackman stars in it as well.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Yes, I have read all of the books and when I watch the film, I sigh every time that there is a plot point changed.  I cringe every time a character is ommited.  Every time a bit of back story is expanded at the expense of something in the book I shake my head in wonderment.<BR>All this aside... the movie is beautiful, well directed , nicely acted and worthy of being watched over and over again.  As a Tolkien fan, I have to say that this is probably the best film adaptation that has or will ever be done of the novel.  I take solice in the fact that they add more of the cut things in the special editions.  I also take further solice in the fact that some day, with computers, some real fan of the books will be able to go back and make a 50 or so hour version of the movie that puts everything back in it's place and all the characters and dialogue.  Computers are doing wonderful things today and are only getting better.  Those characters that you watch and say, \\"Boy, they almost look real, but I can tell that they aren't.\\", soon, hopefully, you won't be able to tell at all.  Sometimes, you can't now.  Maybe Peter Jackson will even do it.  Surely, he realizes that the original is better than his version.  My fingers are crossed, but I would recommend this film to anybody.  I agree about Faramir's changes being terrible, but personally...  who would be so confused with learning the name Mithrandir?  I sure wouldn't.
0151008116|5.0|I have seldom been so moved by a book as I was by Life of Pi. Faith is such a difficult thing to write about. From the outside faith seems endlessly variable and intangible; different cultures, different physical conditions, different ages of man, all these things shape our perception of what faith is. Most distractingly of all, from the outside, faith seems to be wholly contained within the shapes of religions.<br />Without any apparent effort Pi, who embraces all religions equally, takes us inside faith and gently asks us how we would live our lives? Where will we find the strength of heart to endure? <br />A marvellous book whose humour and energy never wane. The only problem is trying to find something to read next that will seem remotely satisfying.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is NOT Rage Against The Machine.  This is NOT Soundgarden.  To fully appreciate Audioslave, one must accept the band for what it is: a completely new band.  The musical style is different (WAY different) than those other bands.  It took me about three times through the album to understand the genius of it.  At first I was still nostalgic for the angry, incendiary, machine-gun-like vocals of Zack de la Rocha.  Chris Cornell is not that vocalist.  And because of that, Tom Morello, Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford have also toned down the pyrotechnics.  <br />However, this album rocks on its own.  From the opening thunderous riffs of \\"Cochise\\" to \\"Like A Stone\\" to my favorite track, \\"Shadow On The Sun\\" to the hardcore riffs of \\"Exploder\\", this is an album that does not disappoint.  Accept Audioslave for what it is: a great band in its own right.  If you do, you will be amazed by this album.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes make very hooky, memorable, 'stripped down' rock.  There is also a huge sex appeal and 'high school gym locker room' camaraderie and playfullness amongst the band memebers that is refreshing to behold!  This is a quality release, and these guys will continue to 'go places'!  Kudos to them and their production staff for a top notch release.
630575067X|4.0|I've never expected good acting out of a Star Wars movie. Heck, I was satisfied with the acting in \\"Attack of the Clones.\\" However, it seems to me like everyone involved went completely out of their way to ensure this movie had the worst acting possible. But like I said, I've never expected good acting in Star Wars, so I'll gladly move on. The film is struggling to create an early Star Wars universe and for the most part does an okay job. While TPM is lacking in many places, the final battle is terribly exciting and well worth the wait of a little over an hour, during which there are peace talks, Jar-Jar Binks, and Samuel L. Jackson doing absolutely nothing interesting. But the final battle with Darth Maul is truly awesome and I even sort of liked the Gungan-droid battle. Sure, Jar-Jar and Anakin are very annoying, but so was Luke Skywalker at first, so stop whining. Sadly, this first episode isn't enough to be a good intro into the Star Wars saga. That job still lies with the fourth episode, \\"A New Hope.\\"
B000002ORU|4.0|The \\"Thirty Years\\" title of this collection is misleading.  Though released to coincide with the band's 30 year anniversary, it had already been 15 years since the death of drummer Keith Moon and 12 years since the release of the band's last studio album.  Only one track was recorded after the band's 1982-83 \\"farewell\\" tour.  Chronological nitpicking aside, this four disc box set, while indeed containing a ton of terrific music, suffers from an identity crisis.<br />Who exactly is its target audience?  I ask that question because it is about evenly split between rare tracks/alternative versions and original recordings from the band's studio and live albums.  As such, the collection is too lengthy to be of interest to casual fans and contains way too much repetitious material for ardent fans who likely already own most if not all of the Who's catalog.  Confusing things even more are a generous helping of \\"dialog\\" tracks (including Pete swearing at the audience during a live show, the band members making disgusting phlemetic noises prior to recording \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\") that do more to damage the band's legacy than enhance it.<br />All of that said, the music itself remains tremendously powerful.  For all of its flaws, \\"30 Years\\" is still well worth repeated listenings for those with a little extra money to spend.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Recently I was turned on to Norah Jones' &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. What a great CD. I would highly recommend it to all. It's pretty mellow, somewhat jazzy in sound and her voice is entrancing. Give it a try.

0596000480|5.0|I can't imagine any serious Javascript developer not having this book in his or her collection.  It is the most complete reference I have seen on Javascript, and one of the most professionally written books period.<br />Where I work, the book is near ubiquitous among our web developers and has proven to be a valuable desk-side resource.  I recently bought the 4th edition, after some of my coworkers commented on how worn my 3rd edition had become.  No surprise, really, considering that I had to share the 3rd edition among six developers, all of whom were learning Javascript for the first time.  I'm glad to once again have a nice, fresh copy of this book, and even more so, glad to have an updated reference with coverage of the new features in Javascript 1.5.<br />I'm pleased to say that the 4th edition lives up to the reputation of its predecessor.  Reading is easy and informative, and the reference section provides answers to just about any question you'd have regarding the language syntax and object model.<br />If you're a web developer and have no other books in your collection, make sure you have this one.
1573226521|5.0|Okay, I loved the Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Richard in the film version of 'The Beach', but (as with most adaptations) the book kicked the Hollywood arse. The story's the same, basically. A backpacker in Thailand, Richard, meets a guy named Daffy who gives him a map to a hidden island, then commits suicide. Richard takes up with two fellow travelers, though they're French. They make it to the island and find a small community living in secrecy. They dive right in and start wonderful new lives but it doesn't last. The differances range from minute details like the fact that Garland's Richard is English, to the way they end. But the ways in which the book is superior are the simplest, but most noticable. The use of Vietnam-war references gives a much more detached feeling to Richard, and the persistance of Daffy's 'ghost' is really interesting. Though the book lacks the really cool lines of the movie ('For mine is a generation that circles the globe in search of something we haven't tried before' or 'I still believe in paradise, but now I know that it's not some place you can look for...it's how you feel for a moment in your life. And if you find that moment, it lasts forever.') the extra time on the beach, as well as the deeper exploration of the rivalry between Richard and Bugs makes up for it. Another thing I liked was the fact that Garland didn't have the sexual content of the movie. Francois stays true to Ettienne, and likewise does Sal (short for Salvester) stay true to Bugs. I was kind of hoping that Garland's Keaty would love Cricket, I was hoping for an explanation on how it's played/scored, but Tetris was a fine substitute. I must say though that I liked the books ending a lot better than the movie's. Even though the movie's end, with Sal pulling the trigger on Richard not knowing that it's empty, drives the idea of 'How far would you go to protect paradise?' really well, the book asks a differant, and (I think) more important question: 'What would you do if paradise was ripped away from you?' Thus the ending, which really illustrates the question well, would be differant and more poiniant. I suggest seeing the movie then reading the book, just so you can get both elements of the story without being disapointed in the content. After reading this book, I can't watch the movie, and I loved that movie.
B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein is quintessentially the best hardcore band coming from Germany. Call it what you want--industrial, heavy metal, alternative rock, etc.--if you like loud, aggressive music, then Rammstein certainly delivers. Pick any of their CDs and you'll be satisfied.<br />On \\"Sehnsucht,\\" the majority of songs are fast and deafening, though a lot of them have deceptively quiet beginnings. Even so, very few (like \\"Klavier\\" and \\"Stripped\\"--a Depeche Mode cover, spoken in somewhat understandable English) can actually be considered \\"slow\\" songs. Lyrics are included, but (not surprisingly) they're all in German, which makes me wish I'd paid more attention in my German classes. Yet even having some knowledge of the language is almost futile when trying to translate their double-meaning lyrics correctly.
0060278269|5.0|This is the last part of a trilogy (the first two books are 'Sabriel' and 'Lirael') and as much, you should definitely read the first two books before reading this one, otherwise it might get quite confusing. This story begins directly after 'Lireal' ends. Lireal and Sam are still trying to stop Hedge's plans coming to fruition, with the help of the Disreputable Dog and Mogget.<BR>Although not my favourite book of the trilogy (I like 'Lirael' best, especially the first eight or so chapters of it) 'Abhorsen' was still excellent. There was lots of action and a very dramatic ending. I thought that it was intresting seeing deeper into Death, with more detailed descriptions of the precints than there were in 'Sabriel'. The plot wasn't confusing and I was glad to see that Nicholas, my favourite character, appeared a lot more. Overall a very good read and a great series for anyone, whether you like fantasy or not. I don't usually read fantasy but I loved these books. <br />I hope that Nix will write some more about this world, because there seems to be a whole lot of material left to explore. (I'd love to know more about the Wallmakers and the Clayr, for a start).

B00005JKZT|3.0|The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring Special Expanded Edition has spoiled me. I saw a film turned from a good fantasy film now changed into an epic masterpiece with just 30 minutes of new scenes and re-editing. After enjoying this film many times I went to see the Two Towers knowing that no matter how good (or how bad) it may be, I couldn't help but always wonder what the 'real' version of this film will be like come Nov 2003. Will it become twice as good as Fellowship became? <br />What we have here is a very good fantasy film, that really throws the book out the window. I feel pretty bad for Jackson who has put himself in quite a pickle. Not only must he worry about fitting ALL the events that occur in the next book but now he has to squeeze in events from the end of the second movie just to have it all make more sense. This is impossible. I had a real problem with the way the film began. We all remember what happened to Gandalf, it seems weird to be re-watching the first film for pretty much no reason. I hope he re-edits the intro just like he did for Fellowship. <br />Another problem I had with this film was that while it continued with it's, \\"the story continues\\" type endings. It really had a chance with this film to give the audience a real cliff hanger especially with the Shelob Spider sequence in the book. Instead we are treated too (but almost bored by) a overly long battle sequence that is given little time in the book but we spend the whole moving preparing for.Another problem is this whole Aragon pretending to die thing. With the next film this will begin to feel like a gimmick now that Frodo and Gandalf almost died in the first film. <br />I didn't like that merry and pippin spend the ENTIRE film on Ent Beard walking. It was almost laughable. I also thought that the Ents should have come to the conclusion of war at the meeting just like in the book. It makes more sense, how else could all those ents appear from out of nowhere? Didn't they knowall their kind were being killed since the first film? I found that hard to believe. Merry and Pippin become so courageous and brave in the book and yet are given little to do by Jackson, that was just stupid. <br />Now beside all that I really did enjoy the movie. Gollum was amazing to watch, and he was my favorite character in the book so it was a real treat. But this book is my favorite of all three so I was most dissapointed with the sacrifices Jackson made. I fear that Return of the King will include many sacrifices as well, including the fact that he may take out the entire scorching of the shire, for running time sake. While this was a very long part of Return of the King (especially after a nail biting conclusion) as part of the book it deserves to be seen in the next film.  <br />Here is my hope in these films. That the expanded version of each film be what Fellowship became. And they, in the end, will be the real trilogy that should have been seen in theatres. <br />Here's to a good film that wil become better by the end of 2003.
B0000039QA|5.0|Six years after this acclaimed artist has left us, I still listen intently as if he was speaking to me directly. When B.I.G. entered the game commercially in 1993, he revolutionized how hip-hop was listened and played. No disrespect to \\"Puff-Daddy\\" or \\"P-Diddy\\", but the \\"Bad Boy\\" lable would not have attained much success on a global level it receives today if the emergance of B.I.G. did not come to light. Tracks such as \\"Sky's The Limit\\", \\"Miss U\\", \\"Ten Crack Commandments\\", and \\"I Got A Story To Tell\\" informed the hip-hop community the man was definitley before his time. The work with \\"R.Kelly\\" displayed B.I.G's diversity with the R&B industry. His lyrics will be with the Hip-Hop and R&B community for eternity. The only question we can now ask ourselves is......\\"Why so Soon\\"<br />  -AllotofVision-<br />  Marshall University, Huntington, West Virginia
B00005Y6YB|3.0|Be warned: this edition of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; is cut down to 240 minutes, from the original 360.  This is perhaps the greatest television miniseries ever made, and it would be a shame to see it in anything but its complete form.  Spend the extra couple of bucks to get the other DVD edition!  My rating of the movie itself would be five stars, but this cut version is a terrible injustice.

B000002L9J|5.0|So much has already been said about The Smiths. I won't repeat it, except to say that The Queen Is Dead contains the best of their idiosyncratic charm, melancholy, humour and inventiveness. Morrissy and Marr are indeed a force. On 'I Know Its Over' and &quot;There Is A Light...' your heart will break. And 'The Boy With The Thorn In His Side' is a contender for most underrated pop tune ever, it's chiming guitars, melodic ease and goddamn happy/sad jangle a tonic for any maudlin start to the day. If you don't know the Smiths well, do not submit to the cliches that they peddle miserablism. Open your ears, your heart and all your sensibilities and be swept away by sheer force and beauty.
B00005JL2O|2.0|I liked the first of the Powers Trilogy, thought the second had some very funny bits but was disappointed by Goldmember. The opening scene was clever with all of the movie within a movie gags. I figured we were in for a real roller coaster ride. Yeah, unfortunately, the ride was mostly down hill. The movie is a loosely joined collection of skits about toilet humor, sexual innuendo and a few (very few) funny (very funny) sight gags. My friends at work, some 15 years my junior, all hated it. I give it 2 stars because there are some fun parts that are probably worth seeing. If you really like Mike Myers films, you will enjoy Goldmember. This DVD version has the Infinifilm feature and it's really a pretty cool add-in.

B00004Z459|5.0|If you have heard any of the songs on this track and like them, just pick up the CD, you won't be disappointed.  There are some great songs on this CD that I have listened to over and over again without getting sick of them.<br />Don't listen to the [stuff] people write about this being the end of rock music or the N'Sync of rock, its all bull.  One of their friends probably made fun of them for listening to this CD so they decided to try to belittle anyone who may like it. Its all music anyways, if you like it, fine, if you don't, all the power to you, I just wish people would quit placing themselves on pedestals (\\"I only listen to real rock music\\" or \\"If you want real music list to (some other band I don't like\\").<br />Sure, the stuff may have been done before, but I think LP does it better, and sure some of the songs sound similar, but who really cares when the songs sound this good.<br />Like I said before, if you like LP's music at all, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD.
B00000DFKF|5.0|Although this work derives its sound from the early works of Bathory, its composition adds a dimension to the experience through layers of internal harmony which sweep through otherwise straightforward and violent songs. The epic nature of Burzum is revealed on the second half of this work, however, where longer songs bloom into mini-operatic ascents into a consciousness that is larger than human. These are similar to a modern Wagner, in that the music is a medium through which an artistic narrative is expressed. Also of note are the raspy, squealing, sighing vocals of Count Grishnack which add an emotional dimension where most bands use a rigid monotone.
0393307050|1.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did.  I was excited at the prospect of starting a 20 book series of swashbuckling adventure.  Now I wouldn't read the remaining books if you made me walk the plank!  I rarely cast aside a book before I finish it but when I reached page 280 and still hadn't come across a significant plot point it was time to run this ship aground.<br />While it was interesting to read about life at sea in that age, an accomplished author would have found a way to do it and tell a story at the same time.  Mr. O'Brian could have learned a thing or two from James Clavell.
B00000JZC4|1.0|Where the first Filter album straddled genres and created music with feeling, this is regurgitated hard rock dreck nearly indistinguishable between songs.

If you liked &quot;Short Bus&quot; try Godflesh &quot;Selfless.&quot;

B00006JL1Z|5.0|My God!  If for no other reason you must get this to see Stevie Nicks' exposed breast and nipple.  On page 7 there are a series of negatives and in the top left one Stevie has her dress pulled down below her breasts.  Stunning!  She was an incredibly sexy woman at that time.  I can't believe it took me this long to notice that shot.<br />This is a definitive collection if you can live with the single versions of RHIANNON, OVER MY HEAD, THINK ABOUT ME, and SISTERS OF THE MOON.  The last two are alright, but I would've wanted the album versions of those first two songs (especially OVER MY HEAD which is really funky compared to the original).<br />Every major hit and FM classic is here and the sound quality is incredible.  The CD-ROM material is decent and features the video to SEVEN WONDERS, the live video of DON'T STOP (from The Dance), GO YOUR OWN WAY and THE CHAIN (live in-concert from the Mirage tour), and a rare live version of RHIANNON.<br />My favorites are the Stevie Nicks songs SEVEN WONDERS, GYPSY, SARA, DREAMS, LANDSLIDE, and RHIANNON (not because of her breasts in the negatives, but because of her incredibly seductive voice!).  Stevie has always been my favorite member of Fleetwood Mac.<br />This collection is much better than the single disc GREATEST HITS, and more concise than the out-of-print BOXED SET.  THE VERY BEST OF is a great introductory package to the classic-era of Fleetwood Mac, and for most people will be more than enough for your personal Mac collection.

B00005JLSC|5.0|Did I hear the word Oscar? This film deserves more than an Oscar. It deserves 100 Oscars!!! I wouldn't know where to begin with what deserves the Oscar. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere all bring out their hidden talents and perform one of the greatest musicals of all time!!!<br />I fell in love with Moulin Rouge and I knew that I would love this one too. And I did. Full of color, liquor and all that jazz, this musical was born by first-time director Rob Marshall, who also did the choreography!!! Who wouldn't want to be a part of this?<br />My favorite scene of the film is where they perform the Cell Block Tango. The performance by Catherine, Mya and the other supporting performers was outstanding, exotic and funny at the same time. If you are a lover of musicals, this is the film for you. I hope everyone gets a chance to see this movie. It is awesome.<br />P.S. Congrats to CHICAGO on winning not one, but three Golden Globes. Chicago, you rock.<br />The Oscars were on last night and what a show!!!  I loved the performance of I MOVE ON performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah.  It still bugs me why Renee didn't perform instead of Queen, because she sings the song on the soundtrack.  Besides that, CHICAGO won 6 OSCARS including BEST PICTURE!!!  Way to go!  Can't wait for the DVD!!!

B00000253N|5.0|Bob Dylan has quite a few classics in his vast catalog.  To select one as his best work can only be subjective.  Why do I prefer BLOOD ON THE TRACKS to his earlier landmarks such as BLONDE ON BLONDE, HIGHWAY61 REVISITED or BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME?  While all four of the albums that I mention are packed with classic songs, lyrics and performances, BOTT has Dylan offering a rare glimpse behind his enigmatic mask.  His personal life was in tumoil at the time due to the collapse of his marraige and this forced his emotions to boil to the surface of his songwriting.  He is both reflective (TANGLED UP IN BLUE) and angry(IDIOT WIND).  Every song included is strong enough to be considered classic Dylan.  The playing is low key folk rock with a blues undercurrent and Bob nails every vocal performance.  That this album has become a yardstick for the rest of Dylan's career is no suprise.  Every good Dylan album over the last twentyseven years (OH MERCY, TIME OUT OF MIND, LOVE AND THEFT) has been hailed as \\"his best since BLOOD ON THE TRACKS\\".  I'm sure that every Dylan fan out there has a favorite album and it's not always BOTT.  All I know is that this release has brought me a great deal of pleasure over the years, both in good times and bad, and I cannot fathom BLOOD ON THE TRACKS  not being a part of my collection.
B00006M183|3.0|Pearl Jam has a funny habit of misnaming its albums. The band's 1991 debut, the smash hit Ten, contained 11 tracks; 1993's confrontationally-titled Vs. was released at the peak of the band's popularity, amidst a crushing wave of media hype; the dense 1996 effort \\"No Code\\" required a decoder; and 1998's Yield, despite its we-can-go-no-further moniker, was a stirring return to accessible, rocking form that suggested a future of bright musical possibilities. It's doubtful that such misleading titles have been intentional, although given some of the band's almost willfully difficult output and its occasional contrarian stances (tilting at Ticketmaster's corporate windmill, shilling for Presidential spoiler Ralph Nader), it wouldn't come as a complete surprise. <br />Either way, the streak continues with Riot Act, a title suggestive of unbridled passion stuck on an album of middling, hook-free doorstops. Oh, there's a riot goin' on, all right, but it's a quiet one, of the internal variety. Riot Act is the sound of a popular band fighting hard not to be populist, continually trying to distance itself from the hits that afforded the financial security that in turn allows its latter-day experimentation. Don't get your humble reviewer wrong: it's always laudable to see a band of Pearl Jam's stature tinker with its sound, especially given the disturbing hegemony, the almost calculated accessibility, of some of the band's earlier and most revered hits. But while it's an easier listen than 2000's Binaural, Riot Act isn't exactly listener-friendly. <br />Not that it doesn't try. One can hear attempts to engage on songs like \\"Can't Keep,\\" the reaching \\"Get Right\\" and, especially, the strident, individualist anthem \\"I Am Mine.\\" But if the spirit seems willing, the flesh is all too weak. None of the songs ever truly achieve lift-off, hobbled by somber melodies and wrong-turn riffs that stumble more often than soar. And thoughtful lyrics (including tunes from bassist Jeff Ament anddrummer Matt Cameron) often trip over their self-importance. On the spoken-sung \\"Bushleaguer,\\" Vedder lambastes our current President in a non-moving monotone, using a clever baseball analogy (\\"Born on third/ thinks he got a triple\\") to obscure the fact that his own beloved Green Party candidate bears some of the blame for getting George W. elected. <br />The most egregious moment, however, comes during \\"Love Boat Captain,\\" in which Vedder solemnly intones \\"It's been sung before/ but it can't be said enough/ all you need is love.\\" Well, um, yes, wrong, and wrong again, Eddie; what is it with high-minded political rock stars like you and Bono, who can rattle off reasoned, intelligent opinions on political matters but end up falling back on over-worn rock tropes like this one? Take heart, all you bombed-out residents of Afghanistan, you withering AIDS sufferers, you starved and disease-scarred Third World denizens, all you political prisoners atrophying away in dank dungeons the world over, hoping against hope for Amnesty International to turn you into the next Nelson Mandela -- all you need is love! <br />It's hard to fault Vedder's idealism, dismayingly simplistic though it might be, and one is more than willing to cut the band some slack, especially given that \\"Love Boat Captain\\" touches briefly on the painful subject of the nine fans stampeded to death during the band's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival in Denmark. And Riot Act does boast a couple of moments that break out of the miasma; the bracing \\"Save You\\" recalls the vitality of Yield and 1994's Vitalogy, and \\"Cropduster\\" and \\"You Are,\\" to name a couple, prove engaging if not fully engrossing. <br />But good intentions and a smattering of interesting arrangements aren't enough to fully absorb the listener. Riot Act is ultimately quelled by a near-palpable hesitation to go for the bright chord, the singalong hook, the Vs.-era anthem rock at which Pearl Jam is so skilled. Surely there's a happy medium between treading too-familiar musical ground and Riot Act's diffuse refusal to let go the restraints and unashamedly rock. If the members of Pearl Jam don't find that middle ground before long, they'll find themselves going all too gently into the dark night of irrelevance. What if Pearl Jam held a riot, and nobody listened?

This movie was wonderful in portraying the life of such a powerful individual. <br />Throughout the movie all I could think of was that words have power -- it was the power of his WORDS that made Muhammed Ali great . . . Because his words proclaimed him into being the Heavy Weight Champion of the World again and again!

B00003CXI1|5.0|My 11-year old daughter and I both have been reading the series of Harry Potter books. We saw this movie in the theaters and we both loved it. It was one of those movies that we just had to keep talking about long after it was over. Of course, as soon as the DVD came out, we had to have it! <br />It is, in my opinion, one of the very few movies that actually holds true to the book. The cast and movie direction - it's look and feel - are right on! Everything in the movie is how we imagined it while reading the book. An excellent movie for kids and adults alike.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This is a very nice DVD collection. I haven't watched all of the special features yet, but I thought it was pretty cool watching all of the original characters (now grown up) talk about the movie and show some clips of things that happened on the set. Both versions are here (I still prefer the original from 82) and both are great. The newest version done in 2002 has the guns replaced with walkie-talkies and have even added some new scenes that are pretty cool. This is definitley the \\"family\\" movie that can be enjoyed for a lifetime.
B00003CXI1|5.0|My 11-year old daughter and I have been reading the series of Harry Potter books and we saw &quot;...the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; in the theater. We both loved it! We couldn't stop talking about it long after the movie was over. And, of course, once the DVD came out, we had to have it!<br />It is, in my opinion, one of the very few movies that is true to it's book. The cast, the movie direction, it's look and feel were all right on... just as I imagined it while reading the book. Truly magic! An excellent, imaginative movie for both kids and adults.
B00000J2PH|5.0|A beautiful classic. A perfect combination of catchy, well-remembered melodies with the intimate, deeply touching voice of Carole King in this all-time favorite album, that manages so much enjoyment today as when it first came out.It contains such songs, as \\"I feel the earth move\\", \\"So far away\\", \\"It's too late\\" or \\"Beautiful\\". <BR>And remember: It's too late, baby, so we really did try to make it, something inside has died and I can't hide and I just can't fake it.
B00005JKCH|4.0|For it's entertainment value alone, movie enthusiasts who don't necessarily consider themselves Spider-Man fans, may actually enjoy the movie more than the hardcore Spider-Man fan.<br />The movie is a fairly good adaption of the classic comic. But, there are some innacuracies and a couple of things I would have liked to see. Hardcore Spider-Man fans will first notice technical issues such as the organic web shooters that are inconsistant with Peter Parker's hand made web shooters from the original comics. That seemed to be such a big issue before the movie ever even came out, and such a departure may not be easily overlooked by an original fan. However, I think for this movie it worked pretty well and it may have actually helped tell the story a little better. And, while I realize that there was just too much to include in a 2 hour film, I still would have liked to have seen (or at least had some mention of) more of Spider-Man's many villians. There was absolutely no mention of some of the more infamous bad guys such as Doc Ock, Venom, etc. Of course, the movie ends leaving you with the impression that there is more to come, so perhaps there's a sequel in the works with more of the classic villians for Spidey to battle.<br />In the genre of super hero movies, I think that Spider-Man is one of the better ones out there, if not the best. One reason is Green Goblin's tough guy factor. He seems to be a much stronger adversary than some of the other goofy, wise-cracking super hero villians, such as Superman's Lex Luther, or Batman's Joker or Penguin.<br />Included on the DVD are notes and commentary by Spider-Man creator Stan Lee and many of the other writers and artists, along with background and history of the comic franchise. Overall, with all the extras included, I'd say this DVD is a must have for Spider-Man fans, and a good buy for the regular movie-goer looking for some entertainment value. The DVD extras alone will keep the Spider-Man fans busy, and will introduce many other viewers to the world of Spider-Man comics.ce many other viewers to the world of Spider-Man comics.
B000003B6J|3.0|There's no denying the effect that this album has had on American culture. It's essentially the penultimate reason why the stupid teenagers next door, and millions like them, fancy themselves hardcore &quot;gangstas&quot;. But jeez-louise, N.W.A. were hardly the first gangsta rappers.<br />Schoolly-D was, as early as 1984. Go to school, children! His seminal &quot;P.S.K. What Does it Mean?&quot;, an ode to the Philly gang the Parkside Killers, set the tone and style for everything that followed it. And Ice-T (&quot;6 in the Mornin'&quot;), King Tee (&quot;If You're Ever in Compton (Ya Better Bring a Gun)&quot;), and Just-Ice (&quot;Hip-hop Gangster&quot;), were all putting down a paradoxically cartoonish street realism over beats while Dr. Dre was still churning out cheesy R&amp;B ballads (&quot;Turn Out the Lights&quot;) as part of the horrible World Class Wreckin' Cru, with a finger-wave in his hair.<br />I like this album for the most part, but I guess I just hate to see undue credit passed its way. Though I will say this: I shoulda bought stock in Old English 800 a loooong time ago...
B000001I0Q|5.0|I actually saw the Lords more than 20 times live in LA from Magic Mountain to the Music Machine and got the rare opportunity to visit Stiv in the recording studio while doing &quot;Have Love will Travel&quot;. Believe me that he would be rolling over in his French grave being labelled &quot;Goth&quot;, whatever that may mean to some. The Lords were a great &quot;Rock'n'Roll&quot; band born out of the roots of the punk rock scene here in LA. They were fun, irreverent and fantastic to watch live. Their first album was born of Stiv's desire to move on to a band that could capture the imagination like the Dead Boys had previously. His tongue was firmly planted in his cheek and his hand in his pants.
B000001ES9|1.0|What makes an album a really good album? For someone who is an album nerd, they might tell you it's all in the cohesive unit, how well the songs connect to one another. For the casual listener, they will more likely tell you that in order to have a great album, you just need to have every song a good one. From the first track to the last, one good song follows another and you don't end up skipping over any of them.<br />When Rush made their debut album in 1974, they got it backwards. One bad song follows another from track one to track eight. There are seriously no good songs on this album. <br />Even the material that Rush incorporated in recent set lists, like Working Man, Finding My Way, and In The Mood are stinkers. The lyrics are immature and the music is annoying. There are no redeeming qualities to these songs other than they are old and funny-sounding.<br />You may want to own this for comedic value or to round out your Rush collection, but this is really the worst album I've ever heard. I bought the tape many years ago, so you can bet that I've listened to it more than once. And let me tell you my friend, I cannot get into this stuff. It's just to hard to take because, like I said, there are no good songs.<br />How Rush became a world-selling act with this as a debut is amazing. It proves that anything is possible.
0064407667|5.0|I look forward to recommending this scary little book to many of my pediatric patients. It is not for the faint of heart, but my patients are usually a great deal less faint of heart than I am. Ask them and they will tell you so.<br />Lemony Snicket -- for that is what the author calls himself -- is sneaky. The plot twists, as expected, but unexpectedly. The atmosphere changes suddenly from horror to humor, and just as suddenly back to horror. Best of all, from my possibly pedantic perspective, the author educates his young readers, but without losing their interest by appearing to educate them. For example, words likely to be unfamiliar to preteens are accompanied by hilarious but accurate definitions.<br />After I wrote this review, I was dismayed to see Lemony Snicket's (real) name on an offensive \\"antiwar\\" petition (published in the New York Times and paid for by an organization called Not In Our Name). I cannot condone Daniel Handler's political views, but my enthusiasm for Lemony Snicket as a children's author is undiminished.<br />Arjun Bamzai
B000066NW0|4.0|Despite all the hype and the neckties and the flashing the middle finger at the camera, Avril Lavigne is no more a punk or a skater (or should I say \\"sk8er\\"?) girl than George F. Will.<br />On the other hand, \\"Let Go\\" is a breezy, fun, well-performed and produced album, and Avril Lavigne is now in position to be the next Alanis Morissette.  It's not perfect, it's not profound, and it sure as hell isn't punk, but it's a cut above the rest of the Britney/Christina/N*Sync bubblegum music out there.
B00003IPFK|4.0|This is a great movie. I have watched it over and over on vhs and recently purchased the dvd. I was dissapointed to find out that the DVD version of the movie is broken up into sections like it is being aired on TV. During climatic parts of the movie, it stops and the credits start to roll.I feel like it is time for commercials. Then in the next scene, the movie starts over again with the opening theme song and the cast and directors names on the screen. I bought the DVD movie version to get away from the TV style of showing it over a couple of days. This totally defeats the point of having it on DVD and kills the moment in the movie. Bad mistake on who ever did this to the DVD version.
0316666343|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but for the life of me, I don't know why it has received so much attention.
B000051S44|5.0|Almost any racing nut should have this in their video collection.  The late Steve McQueen didn't have to act much to do this movie - he's been there.  Thankfully, for racing enthusiasts, there isn't much plot to this - just enough to get Hollywood to buy off on it.  Until you've actually stumbled around the track for 24+ hours, bleary-eyed from following your favorite team with no sleep, this is the next best thing to being there.<br />LeMans is really just about racing.  Having been to the LeMans three times, I can confidently say he captured the on-track commotion and spectacle very well - even including the ferris-wheel across from the tire-bridge.  Although the cars nowadays are somewhat more brutal looking, and FIA whimped out several years back and mandated chicanes on the back straight, it's still a great flick that is even shown today to many tour groups as they wait for the modern race to start.
0694524441|5.0|Please give this author a try. This was my first book by him and I need to get more. Thoughtful.
6304366078|5.0|Grand Prix is one of those racing extravaganzas that's really about racing.  Although the stars are heavy-weights, they add to rather than detract from the racing yarn - Garner does wonderfully, as do Eva Marie Saint, Yves Montand and Toshirô Mifune.  This is an A+ movie all the way, historically close to the fact, and well worth seeing three-plus decades later.  The story line is less clichéd than most pf the racing genre - triumph, overconfidence, loss, disappointment, catastrophe, victory!  And the actors aren't just pretty doodads stuck in and around racing cars, they actually seem to know something about what they're doing.<br />The video depicts the last of the classic era (or the first years of the rear-engine era, as you wish) of Formula One.  Many of the real drivers of the 1960s had cameos in the movie, and if you watch for them you'll see one or two in almost every track scene.  This is a must for those building a racing video library.  Far better than \\"Days of Thunder\\" with respect to being true to the actual sport (cars with smashed in body-work haven't won Daytona in years - except with Tom Cruise driving), and widely acclaimed in its day for pure cinematic accomplishment.  It's still a great, great movie (and if you've got a copy of Grand Prix Legends installed on your PC, you can go out and race the same tracks you just watched on the video).
B00004T9UF|2.0|Yes. I finally am getting around to reviewing Eminem. This is a hard album to review, and you most likely know why. I won't be quoting too many of the lyrics in this review for obvious reasons. [There is a lot of profanity], and there's all of those violent lyrics all over the place. ...<br />The opening is weak, and not just the pointless \\"Public Service Announcement 2000.\\" \\"Kill You\\" starts out very promising, but soon just drags on and on toward the end, and turns into one of the most obnoxious songs Ive ever had the dubious pleasure of hearing. Eminem has some guest stars in \\"... Please II,\\" and even then they can't save the song from being one of the worst entries on the whole album. I can tolerate sick jokes and stuff, but not \\"Ken Kaniff\\" or \\"Kim.\\" Other lesser entries also include \\"Amityville\\" (with some awful rhymes opening it up and being repeated on the chorus) and \\"Drug Ballad,\\" (which suffers from a weak beat and an annoying piano in the background). Not to mention the whole thing is too long. Hardly any of the music here is worth it, leaving a hell of a lot of ... and filler, most of which I have already mentioned.<br />\\"I'm Back,\\" \\"The Way I Am,\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" are a bit better, but they still annoy me. And although I know its not saying a lot, \\"Stan\\" is the best song on this album. For those of you who don't know the story, it's got four verses connected by a catchy female vocal section. The first verse is a man named Stan writing to Eminem in a friendly way, giving the \\"biggest fan\\" sort of letter, saying how he can releate to the lyrics and wants to be like Slim, and also how he's been waiting for a letter back. The second verse is Stan's letter describing his feelings of hatred, frustration, and rejection because he thinks Shady is ignoring him. He mentions how he cuts himself to be like what Eminem makes himself out to be in his songs, and the way he can relate to everything that Slim says, and stating \\"everything you say is real.\\"<br />In the third verse Stan has gone completely nuts and begins to record a tape for Shady, and gets drunk, drives ninety with his girlfriend in the trunk. He feels that he deserves a response and notes that they could have been something together. He now says that he's not like his idol, makes some more angry remarks into the tape recorder and drives off the bridge. Eminem starts out the final verse unaware of what Stan has done, responding with a friendly letter, giving an autograph and encouraging Stan to get counseling after hearing that Stan likes to cut his wrists, saying that he was only joking in his songs. He apologizes for missing out on meeting Stan and taking so long to reply. Finally he encourages Stan to keep his relationship with his girlfriend going well, and hopes that the letter reaches Stan before he does something crazy, like this guy he saw on TV who was drunk and drove over a bridge, \\"come to think of it his name was...you.\\" What a great song. Certainly not the best lyrics ever, but an interesting story acccompanied by a catchy beat, and those are the two good things hip-hop has to offer done at their best.<br />Eminem has talent as a rapper, but it feels like he wastes his talent on the unnecessarily extreme level of profanity which gets really boring after a while, and the violence and sex just ruins the entertainment of some songs. .... Pass.
B00007BH3Y|1.0|I saw the film and all I could think was . . . Get rid of the Phil Glass music!!  Obviously, I did not buy the CD -- the music almost ruined the movie for me.  The music of Glass was great in Koyaanisqatsi, where its constant rhythm and driving force carried the viewer away to amazing locales.  In the case of  the intimate (and sometimes suffocating) film The Hours, however, that same urgency seemed out of place.<br />Now as a music CD to enjoy at home or in the car, the soundtrack may be a better fit.  I hope that the DVD of the film will have a &quot;no soundtrack&quot; option, so that we can enjoy the wonderful acting without the constant &quot;Da-da-da-da, Da-da-da-da&quot; of Philip Glass.
B000002JS6|5.0|Widely regarded as the best hard rock album of the '80s, and one of the finest the style has to offer. I don't even really like AC/DC that much - all of the albums sound the same, and I'm not just being dense. Angus Young even jokes about how they never change their style. It can be a good thing, since they've never embarrassed themselves by flirting with dance or rockabilly, but this band seriously gets really old. With that being said, listening to Back In Black made me fully understand the hype over these guys. The groove they set up in quite a few cases is awesome, and the signature guitar interplay between brothers Angus and Malcolm Young is some of the best around. Their rhythm section is solid and tight. Back In Black, to me, epitomizes everything that's good about the band.<br />The whole tone of the album is exciting and upbeat in being constructed as a tribute to Bon, and almost every damn track is a classic. The only one I really don't like is the closing \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution,\\" not that it's bad, just nothing to get excited about and it pales in comparison to the other songs here. The album starts off perfectly with \\"Hells Bells,\\" featuring an ominous tolling bell at the beginning and an effective dark, cartoonish vibe to its catchy chorus. \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" has an exciting and really loose, gloriously violent feel to it that makes it pretty good. The sleazy nonsense of \\"What Do You Do For The Money Honey\\" is justified by the catchy guitar playing. Have I mentioned yet what a fabulous rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young is? Absolutely fabulous. My favorite songs on this album, however, are all in a row on the second side of the album. \\"Back In Black\\" has one of the best power grooves ever committed to tape. It's extremely simplistic, but still an incredible song. \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" is a big radio staple, and it's easy to see why. The song is a perfectly executed groove and has a solid, memorable anthemic chorus, so you definitely wont hear me knocking it. Then there's the obvious tribute to Bon in the extremely fun party-like \\"Have A Drink On Me.\\" Another really catchy chorus on this one, well-done irony throughout and a fantastic opening riff.<br />The Zep/Stones influence on this album is obvious, but these boys never overreach: they're not trying to show off how many music lessons they've taken, they're not trying to be hip or intellectual, they're not paying tribute to the old blues masters, they're not trying to save the world - they're just playing rock and roll.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Deliverance-  If you have never listened to black metal before, you are missing out.  I was belated, and overwhelmed by the talent in this music.  The talent of these musicians is unreal!  I can't stop listening to this album!  As soon as I figured out how good this music really was- I bought ever single album of theirs!  Just give it a shot- if you like it great- if not- it doesn't matter, I still love it to death.
B0000028M7|5.0|The band's second record is heavy, dark, and disturbing and earned its \\"ultimate drug album of the 90s\\" title. It's also one of my personal favorites, because it makes me cry sometimes with the way I can relate to it. The reason why becomes very obvious after taking a journey through the cryptic yet violent and hopeless lyrics, gloomy musical atmosphere, and brutal riffage that make up this album. From the sudden screams and grinding riff of the opener \\"Them Bones,\\" quite the ultimate wake-up song, the listener is immediately in for a ride.<br />The main focus on this album is Layne Staley's increasing drug problem, first hinted in \\"Sickman,\\" a song that features an opening tribal drum beat that leads into Staley's menacing yells of the possessed and cryptic lyrics, and its unpredictable, offbeat changes to a slower section is a highlight. \\"Angry Chair\\" is also built on a driving, aggressive drum track, with an atmospheric guitar riff, and an intruiging, indecipherable rhyming pattern that hints of pain and confusion. The melody and overall structure of the song also helps it to become probably the album's best. The slower \\"Junkhead\\" deals with the outside world's non-understanding and disgust with his problems, while \\"God Smack\\" is a convincing and menacing track with a scary chorus (and a song that inspired a rip-off band of the same name).<br />Jerry Cantrell, meanwhile, continues to showcase his knack for writing memorable riffs and eerily melodic songs. \\"Dam That River\\" has more of that aggressive and direct riffing with a musical vibe that very much conveys a polluted river with a red sky hanging over it (nice guitar solo here too). \\"Down In A Hole\\" is a very personal tune, with surreal Cantrell and Staley harmonies that has such a haunting atmosphere, no wonder it's a major fan favorite. The lengthy war story set to music in \\"Rooster\\" finds Staley singing the lyrics in the point of view of Cantrell's father, whose Vietnam War experiences inspired the song. And, of course, the album couldn't be complete without the closing \\"Would?\\" which is one of the band's biggest hit singles featuring a distinctive bassline, echoey vocals from Cantrell in the verses, a memorable chorus and solo, and an ending, aggressive performance from Staley (R.I.P.). Oh, and that creepy cover art is just badass.
B00000DR5I|4.0|This Tangerine Dream album is really the first modern chill-out record. Despite its age, the sound is really slick and polished. Describing music is hard, but a friend of mine called it the ultimate album to play on your Bang&amp;Olufsen stereo in a living room furnished by Le Corbusier. It would be all too easylistening if it were not for the fact that it also holds noise and &quot;dirty&quot; sounds such as prepared piano (played in reverse due to early tape-cutting technology). Its also very typical to the Tangerine Dream sound; monotonical electronic melodies mixed with some improvisation.

0719043263|5.0|Most books that style themselves as &quot;introductions&quot; to literary theory fall short of their promise, often resorting to the same jargon the novice is trying to decipher or operating on the assumption that the reader already has a background in the field (which would preclude the need for an &quot;introduction&quot;).  This is the main flaw with Terry Eagleton's much used &quot;Literary Theory: An Introduction,&quot; which is as obscurantist as it is lucid.  Peter Barry's &quot;Beginning Theory,&quot; on the other hand, is the ideal primer for theoretical studies and is, bar none, the least polemical and most straightforward introduction to critical theory yet written.<br />Barry takes the reader step-by-step through most of the significant areas of literary theory (passing over reception theory and substituting an analysis of liberal humanism for the New Criticism), explaining their basic theoretical foundations carefully and clearly, with an emphasis on understanding through example rather than unfocused summary.  He provides basic examples of what critics try to do when they apply certain methodologies and then demonstrates the methods himself with short analyses.  If you have absolutely no background in critical theory, this book is the place to begin.  Barry is painstaking without insulting the reader's intelligence.<br />In short, if you're looking for a readable, thorough examination of the main trends of critical theory, &quot;Beginning Theory&quot; is the best starting point available.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When the episode of 'Once More, With Feeling' first came on, I taped it because I thought it would be good, and I wasn't wrong! I really liked how Joss Whedon put in some comedy along with the actual singing. I loved everyone's voices, especailly Amber Bensons'. She is amazing! I always listen to \\"I'm Under Your Spell\\" first because it is my favourite! Whenever I listen to this CD (which is always!), I get chills up my spine. The only bad thing about it, is that I can't listen to this Cd while I read, because I always sing along and get out of my book! <BR>And just so you know, 'Mustard', is about people with clothes stains. Just in case you haven't actually watched the episode, which you should because they show repeats on SPACE (thank God)!
B00005QZWJ|4.0|We all know that the music of \\"Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship\\" is great. I do not need to talk about that. But rather, I will write about the Limited Edition of this soundtrack. It comes in a red leather slipcase package. It also contains a 24 page color book featuring lyrics and poems. The front is the title, stamped with gold foil. The CD is also enchanced with a special internet link. The content on tis exclusive stuff contains a few videos on the making of the movie, an Enya interview, 2 Enya wallpapers, 4 Enya Buddy Icons, and a couple of other things. Those are the PROS of the Limited Edition.<br />Now for the CONS. There are no extra bonus tracks on this limited edition. The tracklisting is the same as the standard edition. The packaging, although very attractive and nice, is a problem. It sctratches the disk. After taking the disk out and in about 5 times, I discoverved that my disk was scratched. Also, because the case does not snap close, it will flap open at times u don't want it to. As for the internet exclusive content, an internet connection is required. That means you will need a fast connection to fully experience the content.<br />But in the end, I am content with my purchase. Why you ask? Why spend the extra $ when there are many CONS about the limited edition? The answer is simple. Because I am a collector. Because I am a huge LOTR fan. That is why. Even with the over expensive price, I do not mind because this is a collector's item. If you are not a collector, then I suggest buying the standrad edition.

3895080799|3.0|I was excited to read this book for soley one purpose... to read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Once I was done that, I moved on to good and bad stories.<br /> DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE:<br />This story was actually very good and was the reason I read it.  I was satisfied with this story, though the person who needs constant action to keep their attention shouldn't read this as much of it is Utterson investigating.<br /> THE BODY SNATCHER:<br />This book started out shaky and was at first hard to follow, but once you get some pages behind you, you'll understand it well enough.  The ending (I won't give it away) is also VERY strange and it is hard to understand.<br /> MARKHEIM:<br />Ah! Markheim! One of the better written of these tales. It is easy to understand and is cleverly written, and does not drag on and on like some other tales in this book. It is a VERY GOOD story.<br /> OLALLA:<br />This was one of those books that you couldn't wait to find out what happens and then it suddenly just lets you down. It leads up to so much and then doesn't deliver! <br /> THE EBB TIDE:<br />The longest of the tales in this book...which makes you wonder...why wasn't the book named: The Ebb Tide and Other Stories? (Because Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde was best known of course!) The first few chapters in this tale make you wonder whether this story will turn out to be good, but then as the story progresses you realise that the tale is getting better and better (this is probably due to fact that Stevenson worked on this with another author and the more chapters written became more and more Stevenson, the first few chapters being the other author, and the end being all Stevenson.)<br />So your question now is: Do I buy? Don't get me wrong, some stories in this book are good, but others dragged on.  If you are interested in the following:<br />    -Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde<BR>    -Markheim<BR>    -Ebb Tide (Last few chapters are best)<br />...then by all means get this book! If you are just getting it because you need something to read, sleep on it, then make your desicion! Hope I helped!
B000002GK1|5.0|It was 1991. This was the year that Nirvana broke out with NEVERMIND, their blockbuster album that sold millions and brought Seattle to the mainstream. Pearl Jam wasn't far behind with TEN, their multi-million selling rush. But their was one classic that was a bit overlooked around that time, and BADMOTORFINGER was that overlooked gem that was overshadowed by these two giants. Soundgarden proved to be crafting a sonically compelling and rhythmically complex album, and BADMOTORFINGER is a challenging disc full of smart metal riffs and tight rhythms. Drummer Matt Cameron, guitarist Kim Thayil, and new bassist Ben Shepherd bring a tight sound to the fold that was missing from their prior efforts, and with Chris Cornell's unmistakably powerful voice, 'FINGER proved how powerful Soundgarden was back then and still is to this day.<br /><br />\\"Rusty Cage\\" is a full on sonic rush, the hard charging riffs of Thayil and Cameron's fundamental speed-drumming, complete with Ben Shepherd's thick bass and the strength of Chris Cornell's voice. The last notes of 'Cage' roll right into the chugging thunder of \\"Outshined\\", perhaps one of the most classic Soundgarden songs, and with lines like \\"I've got a feeling sold out/I've kept the movie rolling/But the story's getting old now\\", you're sucked into the song's heavy catch. Perhaps the most dramatic song title belongs to \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\", one helluva ride from battle between the throbbing bass, the hard-charging barbed riffs, and the frenzied drums. No wonder it became such a classic, complete with such a controversial video. These are not the only gems abound on BADMOTORFINGER.<br /><br />\\"Room A Thousand Years Wide\\" is perhaps the most metal song Soundgarden committed to disc, but what makes it unique is the saxophone you hear wailing in the last minute of the song! The chugging riffs and tight, thunder rhythm section pound away while Cornell switches from a nightmarish scream to a hushed lull. Soundgarden deserve major points for adding trumpet and sax to their mix, and they use it to great effect on the jazzy \\"Drawing Flies\\", which sounds so neatly fit within the confines of the album's 12 tracks. \\"Flies\\" and \\"Face Pollution\\" are both two-minute bursts of sonic madness, encased close near crawling moments like the nearly seven minute madness of \\"Slaves & Bulldozers\\"; the thud of the dark religious overtones of \\"Holy Water\\"; and the apocalyptic guitar shredding in the menacing \\"New Damage\\". From front to back, you won't find one weak track in the bunch, making this a hard-to-miss classic.<br /><br />While it was still a success, garnering multi-platinum sales and some serious airplay, BADMOTORFINGER was overshadowed by the successes of NEVERMIND and TEN. But fans of Seattle rock and rock in general would do well to give BADMOTORFINGER an open listen. Because of it's tight rhythm section and sharp riffs, complete with Cornell's majestic vocals, this is one Seattle collection you definitely want to rock out at full volume! (P.S. Make sure you check out the limited-edition version of BADMOTORFINGER complete with the SOMMS EP, which contains a live version of \\"Slaves & Bulldozers\\", a cover of \\"Stray Cat Blues\\", and three other goodies)

He left the band <BR>not too long afterwards and only returned in the late '90s.  Flick does just that, the power gets turned on and never stops.<BR>If I had a complaint, its that the album is relatively short clocking in at under 40 minutes.  Highligts include Rising Power, Flick of the Switch, Bedlam in Belgium, and Landslide.<br />What makes AC/DC great is Youngs fluid guitar and Rudd's driving beat.  This album is not short on either.
B00004T37H|5.0|ive seen this movie at least 20 times  and it's sooo cool
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is about a not-so typical teenage boy, Donnie Darko, who is played by the(gorgeous and talented)Jake Gyllenhaal.  Donnie is a paranoid schizophrenic.  However, unlike many movies about people with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia, this movie provides a more three-dimensional perspective than usual.  As the movie progresses, the many subplots, such as town idol and motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, Gretchen Ross and her relationship with Donnie, and Sparkle Motion, the youngest Darko's dance squad, keep the movie from feeling stale- in fact, it feels anything but.  The movie strikes the perfect balance between being funny, sad, and scary.  I definitley recommend it.
0316666343|4.0|This book was great!  A book has to be good for me not to lose interest in it before I finish.  The characters were believable and I fell into their lives, as if I knew them.  However, I thought it would have been more accurate had the writer added some of the emotions that the narrator, Susie Salmon, was feeling after passing into heaven.  While the book is caught up in the emotions that the people on Earth are feeling, there is hardly any mention of the narrator's emotional thoughts.  Regardless, I believe that it was definitally worth my time!  I am sure I will reread it in the future!

B00003XACV|5.0|I didn't get the full impact of Newman's music when I saw the movie, but when I bought this CD, I was amazed. My mother and I listened to the soundtrack on the way home from buying it, and something on it struck both of us. My mother said she could just picture the entire human race running around in fast motion as we listened to the first song, and as the CD eased into mellower music, it was easy to contemplate the prominant undertones of death in the movie.<br />This CD takes you somewhere, cheesy as it may sound. Newman has expertly rendered a spacial soundscape which parallels the movie, and conjures up its images. Its hard to see how you can dislike this CD if you liked the movie, the music is that intertwined with Alan Ball's characters. All in all, a great movie score, the best that I've ever heard.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Assuming you've seen the movie, I'm not going to give a review of that.  The special features of this 2 DVD set are what makes this different than many other DVDs.<br />First off &quot;The Making of Tron&quot; is amazing.  I never understood how much pain staking time went into the development and shooting of this movie.  They describe ever last detail about how they make this unique look and feel never seen in any other movie.  Now that I've seen this, I have since watched the movie in a whole new light.<br />My recommendation is to watch the movie, then the making of, and then watch the movie again (obviously not all in the same day :)  You'll find yourself appreciating every detail and graphic.<br />There's even a fully produced love scene that was fully digitized and left out at the last minute!  This is a must see for Tron fans.  There are also art galleries full of stills to flip through.<br />I give this DVD 5 stars simply because of all the cool content included.
0345440900|5.0|I'm not usually one to take time to write reviews, but I just had to write a review about this book.  I bought this book when our twins were 2 weeks old - they were crying all the time, and we just could not get them sychronized or on any sort of schedule.  My husband and I were going insane and feeling very frustrated because no matter what we tried, it seemed as if nothing would calm our babies.  I applied the EASY and SLOW techniques covered in this book and now -- two weeks later, our twins are on a schedule which includes eating, activity and sleep - and best of all, minimal crying.  I feel confident that they are well on their way to sleeping 5 to 6 hours very soon.<br />I found the breastfeeding advice to be very practical -- I breastfed for 3 weeks and had to give up because I wasn't producing enough - no matter what I tried.  It was refreshing to read a perspective that doesn't make you feel guilty for not breastfeeding.  I felt great grief and remorse for giving up -- but Tracy's perspective made me feel much better about my decision.<br />This book is an easy read and the techniques are easy to apply and they really worked for us!
0375414053|1.0|If I can stop one mom who works outside the home from buying this book I will be happy.  Yes, there are funny moments but on the whole, this book was written to make working moms feel selfish, guilty and all in all bad mothers.  I could barely read this book without crying.  I only work 40 hours a week and rarely travel - but by Kate Reddy's standard - I am a bad mother because I don't keep a spotless house or cook every meal my children consume.  Do children of working moms really hate them?  Is it really impossible to have a balanced life?  I hate to give away the ending but it will make any mom who has to work outside the home sick.  If she put as much time into finding a balance - spending more time with her children and less climbing the corporate ladder or getting even with her stupid male co-workers - the book would have been more realistic.  By the end of the book Kate Reddy is the perfect mother - her house is cleaned by her and she cooks every meal for her children.  Luckily she also starts a successful home business that I am sure will require her to work only moments a day and that she will make a million dollars from.<br />Trust me working moms - DON'T do it to yourself!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|...BR>If you sit around and try to say this movie is one thing or another then you don't get it.  Sometimes a movie is just a movie.  Donnie Darko is not a horror, sci-fi, drama, comedy, or edgy indie film!  If you expect it to be any of those things then you are in for a rude awakening.  It is a story.  Period.<BR>... <BR>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is tired of the \\"hollywood-got-to-blow-something-up-every-few-seconds\\" types of movies.  And if it leaves you with you asking questions and wanting to talk to someone about it in the end then I think it did its job.

0156907399|4.0|When I read a poem I generally have to read it several times before I can fully (hopefully) absorb its meaning. To The Lighthouse (TTL) reads like a prose poem, a text that also needs more than one reading. You read it slowly, and intently, and then reread passages. This being the case it is somewhat gratifying that the book is only 200 pages long for if it went beyond that it could become a sizable reading project.<br />The reader becomes a spirit flitting between the minds of the novel's characters. Their thoughts become the substance of  the story. The plot is minimal; the action insignificant. In fact, the most physically active participants of TTL  are the sun and the wind which prowl through a decaying house in the book's mid-section. Here Ms. Woolf becomes particularly poetic in describing the effects of the elements on a house that has been abandoned for ten years.<br />Mrs. Ramsey is a strong woman who is married to a professor who is well grounded in Victorian views about women. Her role is to serve her family, and to praise and feel sympathy for her husband. A physically attractive woman with eight children she still has ways of wielding power over people.  Lily, on the other hand, is a single woman who values her independence, but doesn't seem  -to me- to be achieving anything.  The male characters are generally weak men who compensate by being arrogant. And it is not what these characters say that matters as much as what they think, and that is something you are privy to throughout the book.<br />The first 100 or so pages portray a one day scene in the lives of the Ramsey's and their guests in their seaside vacation home. Around thirty pages of the book are devoted to a dinner scene in which most everyone is bored. I must admit that the boredom was convincing as I began to be suffused with the same feeling. I am sure, however, that if I read this section one more time I will view it in a different light.<br />This stream of consciousness novel should be read by everyone interested in reading their way through the literary canon. Although it is a 1920s experiment in form it is still highly accessible to the average reader.be read by everyone interested in reading their way through the literary canon.

B00003CXE7|5.0|A must see movie. It really is that good. Crowe did an outstanding acting job. No wonder it received so many Oscars.<br />You'll want to watch this more than once.
B00006CXSS|3.0|I hate to disturb the almost perfect 5 star viewer rating, but &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is no where nearly as good as &quot;Battleground&quot; (made in 1950 and starring Van Johnson). <br />&quot;Battleground&quot; also depicts the men of 101st Airborne division, albeit of the &quot;I&quot; Company. But, unlike &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot; does not resort to mock-heroics or false philosophizing. Unfortunately, &quot;Battleground&quot; is available only on VHS. <br />While I don't deny that both &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; are important movies from a historical perspective and that these stories are well worth telling today, I have problems with both movies depicting GIs with too modern a body language for the era, using inappropriate dialogue and idioms, and having too much &quot;attitude&quot;. <br />In all the three episodes of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; that I watched, the acting was mostly mediocre, with the actors swaggering and giving the impression of &quot;look at me, I am a cool WWII GI&quot;. The GIs look a tad too smart for front line, the uniforms look too clean (with brushed cotton texture) and the haircuts look too perfect. The compter-generated effects are all too evident. The tracer bullets look too video-game like. In the &quot;Bastogne&quot; episode, the parachute supplies falling on Bastogne almost look cartoonish. <br />I had a laugh with some reviewers saying &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is the best war movie, ever, period, etc., etc. To them I say get hold of copies of movie greats like &quot;The Story of GI Joe&quot;, &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot;, &quot;The Desert Rats&quot;, &quot;The Bridges of Toko-Ri&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot;, or &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot;. These are the real five-star movies!
6305696071|5.0|Funny, entertaining, and witty. 'Pretty Woman' is the perfect romantic comedy. You'll laugh. You'll swoon. You'll might even cry if you're the sensitive type. This movie got it all. And I never get tired of watching it over and over.
B000069AUI|5.0|What can I say? This album is perfect. Every track will pull at your heart strings in one way or another (Politik, the Scientist and Amsterdam being my personal favorites).<br />Don't listen to anyone who compares Coldplay to Radiohead - they are nothing alike. Radiohead's debut Pablo Honey may be a distant relative of Coldplay's Parachutes, but that's as far as it goes. Coldplay have carved their own niché in the music world with their stunning blend of piano, guitar and Chris Martin's beautiful vocals.<br />It is so unbelievably refreshing to hear a band in this day and age who are content to stick with their own kind of music. They aren't trying to please everyone by attempting to merge an infinate number of genres into one song. Coldplay's songs are so simplistic in their honesty - that is probably the reason they have gotten so much attention in this manufactured pop/hip-hop saturated market.<br />This truely is a modern classic. Buy this album - you won't regret it.
B0000042H4|4.0|Solti's really is an &quot;exciting&quot; set, intense, dramatic, effect-after-effect, with a thrilling star-studded cast. In how many places Solti changes the tempo abruptly to surprise you! In how many scenes you head artificial sound effects!  To pursue dramatic effect, he even alters the score -- the brass in the measure right before Bruennhilde sings &quot;Zu neuen Taten...&quot; in the Goetterdaemmerung Prelude!! They(Solti and Culshaw) want you to listen for the string at this time and the brass at another. Alas! How exciting! I wish such a stunning cast as this set's could have been placed under a more understanding conductor than Sir Solti storming in the climax and sweeping through the subtlety.  I feel this set cannot sustain repeated listening, because eventually I would get bored with those effects or surprises.  This is not what Wagner is supposed to be(or he would have been another Meyerbeer).  <br />Boehm, Furtwaengler, Karajan, Krauss show me how wonderful Wagner's music is, while Solti keeps reminding me of his presence.  Is this a wonderful set?  Yes, absolutely.  Is it Wagner?  Well, it is Wagner overpowered.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I just finished watching \\"Band of Brothers\\".  From start to finish, it held my attention, and sucked me in.  I had all too real dreams, after my wife would drag me to bed each night.  <br />I can't imagine what these men went through, but this movie did give me a slight understanding, and I would not wish their experiences on anybody.<br />My son, whose 19, gave me this box set for Christmas.  He watched it before I had a chance to watch it.  He then watched many of the episodes with me while I was watching it.  This movie should be required viewing for high school history students studying this time period.  Everyone that thinks war is something that we should glorify, will go away with a different perspective.<br />This movie honors these valiant men, and realistically shows the viewer that war is hell, and should only be reserved for the preservation of freedom, and the restoration of peace.<br />Thank you Hanks and Speilberg!

B00005JKZT|3.0|The action in the movie is good. It has most of the elements of the story in it. What brings the movie down in mine opinion is a lack of truth to the storyline. The story has a little too much embellishment for my taste. All elements of the story were altered greatly from the books except one. The one exception<BR>was the sequence of Gollum. His scenes, particularly those were he was arguing with himself, were perfect. As for the rest of it,  I liked it for the action, but I am afraid that people who read the books after they see the movies will be disappointed, feeling that the books let them down.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I loved this movie as well as Princess Mononoke. I was surprised Disney even decided to help bring it to the US. Spirited Away was so much more mature than most, perhaps all, of the animation made in the US. The plot was well done, the animation outstanding, and the music was beautifully written. There was only one thing that bugs me and it is with the fact that many people thought that Disney wrote, produced and animated this movie, when they are only presenting it to American audiences. All the work was done without thier aid, and it shows. I fear that if they really had a hand in this movie that if would be suitable only for three year olds (i.e. way too fluffy, cute, innocent and driving everyone above tens years of age nuts).
0066214122|5.0|As an avid Michael Crichton fan, I have read every fictional work currently published, and Prey is definately one of the best.  He holds the reader in suspense, combining the terror of microorganisms as in The Andromeda Strain and the entangled feeling of Sphere.  I was able to finish this novel in three days, and was found arguing with myself at 3 in the morning whether to sleep or to continue reading.  I give this novel my whole-hearted recommendation, and hope all Crichton fans enjoy it as much as I have.
B00006X06U|5.0|...It's my opinion that if you think this loses the essence of Joni Mitchell's songs you are missing the point. This is the FORM of her compositions with a completely different superficial context . The melodies are still there although they may be distilled to essence in some cases - devoid of superficial ornamentation or high note pyrotechnics. The harmonies may be enhanced or presented with different arrangements but the FORM, the heart and soul of the tunes remains. This album shows that her music is as timeless and well-constructed as the standards which she showcased on the last orchestral album. Joni Mitchell, like her or hate her, is a genius of music composition and this is  a snapshot of her music moving from the fleeting realm of popular entertainment to the eternal realm of beautiful forms.
0385503954|2.0|perhaps the hype surrounding this book was too intense.  i waited about 3 months to retrieve this book through the library system and several times i debated buying it just so i could feel part of the critical adulation of this book.  boy, i would have been so sad if i had actually paid for this book!  i hated all the characters right from the beginning and found all that foreboding to be totally obnoxious.  i wish someone could just explain to me the merits of &quot;atonement.&quot;
B00004X0Q0|3.0|This album has a very powerful initial effect. The Sheer energy and intensity of this band is mind blowing. They make Rage Against the machine sound like a bunch of old whining veterans. When i first bought this album i listened to it daily, but the novelty soon wore off. The same thing happened with System of a Downs Toxicity. Most of the songs do contain strong melodies and hooks, but they are hidden by a thick wall of distorted cacophony. It just becomes too grating to listen to. Enfilade is still a brilliant song and is one of the best songs i've heard of the new millenium. Relationship of command is great accomplishment for At the drive-in. It gained them some much deserved recognition and hype. Unfortunately it remains as one of those albums i'm proud to own but never really listen to. I would still see them live though, if they decided to re-unite.

630282091X|5.0|The Owl Moon video delighted my two and a half year old grand-daughter.  It contains three Caldecott stories: Owl Moon. Make Way for Ducklings, and Strega Nona. All are well done, but it is Owl Moon that stands out. We showed her this video before buying a copy of the book. The mood created by the video absolutely entranced and captivated her.  She kept asking her daddy to tell her the owl moon story, so it led to buying the book. It is nice to see a video that leads to an interest in reading.
B0000039PW|5.0|The first time that I actually listened to this CD straight, I was blown away. I have been a rap fan for year's, but I never really listened to this CD. I mean I heard Juicy and Big Poppa, and that's about as far as that went. This CD is a masterpiece, and in my opinion the best Rap CD to date. Song's like \\"Gimme the Loot\\" and the self titled track \\"Ready to die\\" are hard hitting gangster rap songs. And praise the lord P Diddy didn't ruin this CD like he did on \\"Life after Death\\". Life after Death is a great CD, but you can definatley see that Puffy had a stronghold over it. Top cut's on this CD: \\"Ready to die\\", \\"The What\\", \\"Gimme the Loot\\" and \\"Things done changed\\"
0786867973|3.0|I've been making several recipes from this book and they've turned out, but only because I am a professional cook and knew when something in the ingredients list was &quot;off&quot;.  Primarily, most of the recipes are not sweet enough.  I made the banana muffins (so lowfat and moist!) and just added half a cup of brown sugar to the honey the recipe called for.  Doubled the sugar in the Snickers muffins.<br />So I suggest you dip in a spoon and try the doughs of the sweet recipes before you go ahead and bake them.  It has worked for me.<br />Beware too, of too much salt.  1 tsp in the brown bread is plenty, not the 1T the recipe calls for.<br />Interestingly, a lot of these recipes are better COLD.<br />I still like this book because the pictures and text always make me want to bake them for family and friends...
0064407667|5.0|This is excellent writing. Mr. Snicket is as strong a children's writer as I have seen in a while! His writing style asks you to think, while your holding your sides laughing. These books are so cleverly written. The humor ranges from subtle to ironic to obvious. This book made me laugh out loud, more than a few times and that doesn't happen a whole lot...<br />Poor Klaus, Violet and Sunny. You can't help but laugh at their misfortune. The understated way that the author tells about that horrible day when they lost their family and the series of unfortunate events kicked off by that day is brilliant. His style is the best since Roald Dahl. I loved all of Dahl's books, and have enjoyed each of these books so far! If you like understated, dry, ironic humor then you will love these books.<br />Lemony Snicket has such a great sense of timing he knows how to be self- referential without being ridiculous. The inside jokes are great. They really make you feel like you are part of something.<br />Enjoy this book... it is so sad it's funny!<br />These books are a little dark, so they may not be appropriate for young children.  But mid- elementary students will really enjoy them.
6304806426|5.0|I've watched the English Patient more than a couple of times and it just never ceases to amaze me. This enchanting film requires the viewer's total concentration as it engulfs the viewer in a whirlwind of culturual / sensual experiences spanning across the deserts in pre-war Egypt and in an ancient monastery in the Tuscan countryside.<BR>I disagree with reviewers' attempt to rule out the movie merely based on morality issues. Adultery is wrong and there's no doubt about it. The story, however, did not \\"glorify\\" adultery. We are human and we are all constantly tempted to give in to guilty pleasures. In the end, we are told of the destruction the adulterers brought on to themselves and also to those around them. It IS unfair; but whoever thought that life is fair is naive (or I would go as far as to say, foolish).<BR>Some may find it hard to relate to Fienne's charater, Count Almasy. Yes, he indeed is aloof and he knows he is \\"rusty with social graces\\". He is a self-centered, arrogant but cultured polymath who knows lyrics to every song ever written and is fluent in many languages. He is a man of few words (and few adjectives) and may not be immediately likeable to some. Nevertheless, I am amazed that some reviewers find the romance between Almasy and Katharine (beautifully portrayed by Kristin Scott Thomas) abrupt and \\"seemed to come from nowhere\\". To me, the underlying sexual tension between them is blatant. BLATANT. <BR>When Katharine recited the story about Gyges from the Histories by Herodytus in the camp, you know Almasy was hooked. What did Almasy bring to the expedition other than the only one book by Herodotus? And from Katharine's (ahem... Mrs. Clifton) perspective, she knew she liked him (remember the scene where she offered Almasy her paintings to paste in his book?) and her fate was sealed when they were trapped in the car amidst a sandstorm. \\"Let me tell you about winds...\\" Katharine swooned as Almasy whispered the words in her ears. Almasy invoked in her a greater sensitivity to music and arts. But what about Geoffrey, her husband? Well, let's put it that way - when they were taking turns to perform in the tent where Katharine recited the Herodotus, Geoffrey sang this stupid song about bananas and potatos. It's easy to see how Almasy aroused Katharine's desires for him - it's all in the brain (and whoever claims it's just lust between them must watch this movie again). Geoffrey has so little to offer in anything remotely intellectual. Don't get me wrong, Katharine does love her husband, albeit in her own rather rational way. Sadly, a vow is a vow and it is not meant to be broken. Geoffrey has every right to be angry and his plans to kill Almasy is instinctively understandable. <BR>I find Almasy pitiful - When he lost his usual reserved self in the dinner party and made a fool of himself, it is clear how consuming and destructive passion could be. Everything fell apart when they failed to restrain themselves, for \\"the heart is an organ of fire\\" and they are but two mortal humans.<BR>The music Yared composed for the movie was splendid. The lush, heavy orchestral arrangement entwined with Hungarian folklore was very appropriate and demonstrative of the tempestuous and complex affair between Almasy and Katharine. On the other hand, piano excerpts from the pristine Goldenburg variations summed up the essence of Hana's affair with Kip, which is feelings of yearning and longing in its purest and simplest form. The use of a folklore of ambiguous origin (it's not until middle of the movie that we know it is Hungarian) greatly enhances the mysterious tone that envelops the entire movie.<BR>The movie is a feast to the senses. I obviously skipped a lot of important twists and plots, such as the story of the vengeful thief Caravaggio (brilliantly played by Dafoe), and failed to elaborate more on the romance between the selfless kindred spirits, Hana and Kip. I lack the vocabulty to describe how I feel about the movie but it really is a timeless classic. I agree that the story / picture has its flaws (and so are the doomed lovers); yet this movie is not to be missed. It indulges you in dreams all day... <BR>Apart from the spectacular cinematography brought by John Seale, the movie has a lot more to offer. It addresses issues of fidelity, identity and nationalism. The implied theme suggesting we're all citizens of the world is reminiscent of the theme in Casablanca. In some bizarre ways, Almasy is not totally unlike Rick in Casablanca, for they both refuse to be confined by bounaries set by the world and they do not give in to bureaucracy. The only difference is - Rick is older and wiser. <sigh><BR>So - with a superbly clever and sensual movie like this (completed with beautiful swing tunes like \\"Cheek to cheek\\" and \\"Where or when\\"), who could ask for anything more?
B000002H2H|5.0|Before I get started, I would like everybody to know that \\"Stephanie\\", who reviewed this album as well, copied and pasted her review directly from artistdirect.com (showing a lack of creativity and passion towards music). Now, how do I possibly open a review about an album like Ride the Lightning? Argue it all you want that Master of Puppets was better, I'll disagree every time. Every last song on Ride The Lightning is a pure classic. The album starts off with a classical guitar solo on \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", only to smash all of that with an unbelievably fast thrash guitar from Kirk Hammett. One of their most angry songs ever recorded, it sets the pace for the rest of the album. The title track starts off slower in tempo, but not in it's level of emotion. The fear and paranoia of the electric chair that make up the lyrics are just flat out haunting. The next track, \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", is one of the group's most recognizable songs. Starting off with just simple church bells ringing, it soon moves into one of the most memorable guitar parts in the history of metal. The next track, my personal favorite off this album, \\"Fade To Black\\", is stellar in every way. It guitars are, in my opinion, the best Metallica ever wrote. The lyrics are out of this world, describing the pain of loneliness and the want of suicide like no other song I've ever heard. \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" and \\"Escape\\" follow, leading up to \\"Creeping Death\\", which has a slightly misleading name. One would think this is a dark, evil song by its title, but closer inspection of the lyrics shows how it tells the story of the plagues of Egypt, and does it in a way that hasn't been done before, telling the story through the eyes of death. I give Metallica high creativity points for that. Lastly, the 9 minute album closer, \\"The Call of Ktulu\\", is an instrumental that is unforgettable. Jumping back and forth between classical and thrash guitars might sound like a bad idea, but Metallica executes it perfectly.My only regret is being able to give it only 5 stars, I wish I could give it much more. One of the greatest albums ever recorded. If you don't own it, we forgive you, just go buy it right now. No fan of any form of rock should be without this masterpiece.

6304118392|2.0|Oliver Stone is a director who loves shocking, bizarre imagery and enjoys the use of strange lightng, a variety of film stocks, and quite often too many cuts. This worked vary well in the movie The Doors. He toned it down enough to where it did not hurt the overall effect of Nixon or Platoon but it practically killed the otherwise decent U-Turn. In this movie, like U-Turn,it is just plain awful. While there are a few, well, very few good scenes, like the Rodney Dangerfield cameo, for the most part they just seem over indulgent. <BR>Quentin Tarantino has far fewer films but is much better at making movies. The original script that Tarantino wrote succeeded at exploring all the things Oliver Stone has said this movie was about. That is the media's glorification of violence and our consequential desensitization to it. <BR>But the heavily rewritten version that Stone made was basically  a moderately entertaining exploitation film with a couple of anti heroes that it is okay to like because the bad things they do aren't there fault.
B0000262QW|5.0|A few weeks ago I had this disk on a home and two of my guests enthusiastically asked about this \\"new music\\" that was playing.  They were stunned to learn that it was recorded more than 30 years ago.  I guess it was the retro-resurgence of the electric piano that fooled them.<br />\\"Return to Forever\\" really is a stunning disk - Chick Corea's self-conscious attempt to write more accessible compositions after more experimental pieces of the late 1960s early 1970s, with a band that spanned the acoustic and emerging electronic frontiers of jazz.  That band was a remarkable confluence of backgrounds and talents:  reedman Joe Farrell's traditional jazz background, from Brazil Flora Purim and Airto on vocals, drums, and percussion, the teenaged prodigy Stanley Clarke on acoustic and electric bass, and Chick Corea's unique talent for making an electric piano sing.  The music that they created was at once challenging, accessible, and joyous.  \\"Return to Forever\\" together with the companion disk \\"Light as a Feather\\" taken from the same recording sessions capture a singular moment that stands with anything that these musicians subsequently produced.
B000068PQ0|3.0|Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is a good album, eminently listenable, but since when does sounding like ELO earn you alt-rock cred and points for originality? It's fun to listen to, and the melodies will stay with you for a while, but don't listen too hard to the lyrics, which are every bit as unimpressive (and in some cases, cringe-worthy) as The Soft Bulletin. <br />And don't be fooled by twenty-something &quot;critics&quot; who think this is some kind of groundbreaking work; those guys have obviously never picked up an ELO, ELP, or Moody Blues album. That's not much of a knock on the Lips, because I like those old bands, in small doses, anyway. But to herald the Lips as &quot;great artists&quot; while despising Jeff Lynne is to entirely miss the point.

B00004SW9R|4.0|The first time I heard this record, I thought: \\"This is awful: Poorly recorded, out-of-tune instruments and voices, uninspired and pretentious tracks...\\" I was looking for something like 'Gumbo' -one of my favourite records of all time- and found something completely different instead: No funk, little Blues and almost no piano. <BR>However, after some time, I gave it another try -without any prejudice- and was gladly surprised. I had been mistaken... Next time I realized it, I was wanting to hear 'Walk On Guilded Splinters' and 'Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya-ya' again and again. I read a few things about the great Dr. John and found out that actually those songs (that are not traditional, but composed by himself) were used FOR REAL in vooodoo gatherings and even rites! They sure transmit a very 'haunting' mood, to say the least. Was I hoodooed? -Shivering-<BR>To me, those tracks are worth the entire album, although 'Danse Fambeaux' and 'Mama Roux' are also interesting. The reason why, having such classic tracks, I do not give it the top mark is because I feel that the album is a little too short and uneven.  Anyhow, it is still a landmark album for Dr. John that was a very risky bet at the time of its release (Ahmet Ertegun, boss of the record company, hated it).  <br />I bet those sessions were conceived with some mixture of true spirituality and humour. These days, when I feel psychedelic, I play Jimi Hendrix's '1983' or 'Gris-Gris' if I want to shiver a little bit...

B00006F83Y|3.0|I have to say I really enjoyed QOTSA earlier noise, Beaver, The Pinup and Rated R. I don't know what to think of songs for the deaf, it's really sort of a lame and categorized album. The songs seems to be a smorgasbord of 80's tunes with a heavy edge ranging from remnants of early Oingo Boingo to Black Flag. Strangest mix of dark Los Angeles pop. <br />Earlier QOTSA seemed more original, this kind of seems like a weak rehash.<BR>If you are new to this sound avoid this one and pick up some Kyuss or early QOTSA.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter is a guilty pleasure.  When I read the books and when I watched the movie, I had to suspend my normal criticism of implausibilities and read the books and watch the movie as an entertaining fantasy; and the movie is ever so entertaining!  Even having read the book, I was still in suspense with the movie, because certain things were given more life in the movie than the book (and vice versa).  I found myself fascinated with each detail, and was readily able to consider the movie as a different version of the book.<br />The actors were perfectly chosen for their roles.  Alan Rickman as Snape was so dislikable and the perfect character to mislead the audience.  Richard Harris was a lovable Dumbledore, and will be sorely missed in the future movies, which there will undoubtedly be.  Warwick Davis of \\"Willow\\", \\"Return of the Jedi\\", \\"The 10th Kingdom\\" and many more played two roles in this movie, and played them very well.  There are many other actors that did so very well, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out the selection of Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, the terminally cute Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and super-nice (at least he comes across that way on the screen, regardless of how many practical jokes and other mischief he performed on the set while making the movie) Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.  These three were able to make the adults wish they were their children, and the children wish they were their friends.  A good deal of the success of this movie is due to the charm of these three young actors.<br />The score completely enhanced the sets and the plot, and brought another dimension to an already multi-dimensional movie.  The special effects were state of the art, evidenced time and again throughout the course of the movie.  The troll and Fluffy I particularly found impressive in their detail and quality.  However, the special effects and their quality are found throughout this movie, and to list all my favorites would take much more than this review.  There are a lot, and they are all very good to excellent.<br />The movie had to deviate from the book due to the length and detail of the book.  However, I believe that the movie caught the essence of Harry's life and attendance at Hogwart's.  The deviations were regrettable, but the movie was already well past 2 hours in length, and the producer was faced with difficult decisions regarding what to keep and what to cut.  The deleted scenes shown in the second CD will show how some of the decisions were made, and I concur with nearly all the choices.<br />Harry Potter is a pure fantasy, creating a world that is based on many worlds, and yet is none of them.  The rules of Harry's world will seem familiar, yet as a set are different from previous rules.  Once you realized that J.K. Rowling was not basing Harry on any known set of rules, but was instead creating her own \\"Oz\\", the movie and story become enjoyable as a voyage of discovery that parallels Harry's own.

B00005JKCH|1.0|Once again, Hollywood in their fear of not making the absolute most money on their product has programmed codes that prevent you from seeing certain films if your player is multi-zone. Don't even get me started on the insistance of Hollywood on having zones in the first place. If someone likes to see foreign films and wants to get a DVD from another zone (i.e. Europe, Japan, etc.), well, too bad for you, because where multi-zone players are common in other countries, they are relatively hard to get in the U.S., and you can't play a foreign DVD on a regular American DVD player.  So, say you teach a foreign language/culture. You are out of luck if you want to show your students real films from other countries, not just the ones distributors deem profitable for U.S. release.

0140177396|5.0|I have just recently read the book &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; by John Steinbeck and it is one of my all time favorites. John Steinbeck depiction of the farmland of the early 1900's was incrediable. The book is about two guys George and Lennie. George is the brains and Lennie some how screws everything up. Lennie has a good heart and good intentions but he is definatly clumsy. Even though the book is only about 120 pages long, it is so good, it ranks up there with the long books i've read. Just an awesome book all the way around. If i could i'd give it more than 5 stars.

B0000797IO|4.0|Jennifer Aniston does a surprisingly good job at portraying Justine, the fed-up Retail Rodeo employee who begins an elicit affair with Holden, a co-worker 8 years her junior.  I find it funny that one of the reviewers thought of this movie as a \\"comedy\\".  The dialogue is humorous at times, but I think this story has a lot more to it than meets the eye.<br />Justine sees her life as a prison, as does Holden. He swings open the door of curiosity in her life that makes her wonder if there's more for her in the world.  Yet, the \\"good girl\\" mentality she holds throughout the movie obligates her to deny her feelings for Holden and stick with her pot-smoking, impotent husband.  <br />As you watch, you at first root for Holden and Justine.  You want them to escape their small town and find out what life holds for them.  Then you start feeling like that isn't right either; Holden is, after all, only 22...and a depressed, rather mentally disturbed 22 at that.  Justine sees in him a possibility, but still a bleak possibility.  <br />This leads to a battle of motivations:  do you stick with the life you are familiar with and is socially acceptable, even if you're depressed out of your mind, or do you escape into a life more exciting that could very well be as bad or even worse?  This is what makes me not know what to think.  Justine obviously has personal issues she needs to work out, but she sees her answers in other people and not in herself.  This makes her a sympathetic character, but you hate her all at the same time.  <br />The story is very well-conceived, and the actors do a marvelous job portraying Justine's equally-dysfunctional co-workers, family, and friends.  <br />The deleted scenes on the DVD are funny, and some would have been helpful to explain some of the progression in the story.  However, the movie is mysteriously captivating on its own, and I think Aniston should be recognized for this gross departure from her flaky counterpart on \\"Friends\\".
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have just finished viewing the series for the first time and I plan to visit it over and over. It is a must see for any number of reasons. First, it de-glamourizes war while at the same time elevating to Olympic heights the nobility of the participants. Not an easy task. I wonder what the producers would have done with a Civil War theme. \\"Gettysburg\\", based on the novel \\"The Killer Angels\\", provided an outline for this kind of work, but Band of Brothers is a true masterpiece in execution.<BR>This should be required viewing for zealots at both ends of the political spectrum: those armchair generals who would have wars going at the drop of a hat, and those eyes-wide-shut peace activists who never seem to tire of finding fault with America, while at the same time enjoying the constitutional protections saved by the quiet heroism of the men of Easy Company.<BR>The kinship still demonstrated by the vets of Easy Company in their annual reunions is amazing and touching. But what a price they paid for it! With no disrespect to vets of other wars like Korea, Vietnam, Gulf, I wonder if the difference between WWII and the rest was a sense of a mission fulfilled. In Korea, a hostile truce continues to this day. In Vietnam, of course, the US retreated ingloriously from Saigon in 1975. In the Gulf, we ripped through the Republican Guard like a knife through butter, but somehow Saddam survived and the same threat remains. Americans who died liberating Europe are often still buried there in the ground they freed. In the other wars, no expense is spared to remove American dead, which is a shame in a way, because they died for a cause they believed in, defending or taking ground occupied by their comrades. It demeans their sacrifice and makes them seem more like mercenaries than liberators. I wonder if the morale of the troops in Vietnam would have been differernt if they, like Easy Company, were in the fight until it was finished, rather than waiting for their 365 days to be up sothey could go back to the \\"world\\".

0140042520|5.0|When I reread this book after so many years I found myself wondering if we were ever really like this. The innocence, the lack of pretention, the sincerity - it is so totally alien from what this society has become. Sure Jack Kerouac had his problems with booze and relationships, but at his core there was somehow this absolutely blinding glare of innocent purity. Here was a man whose primary concerns were always the meaning of life, the nature of god, the suffering of innocents, whether he was boozing it up in a bar, hopping a freight, or hold up in a look-out cabin on top of a mountain. Jack Kerouac was a true poet in a world were poetry was in abysmal decline both before and after. Jack Kerouac's life was a spontaneous living poem- the dionysian poem of the living holy fool.<br />This is my favorite of all Kerouac's novels. I've had people comment about how I must have patterned a huge part of my early life on this book. I remember thinking so too, except all my wandering and wondering took place before I even heard of Jack or his books....

Sorry people. I don't mind if you say my review wasn't helpful.<br />What I do like about Cats:<br />-Okay voices<BR>-Some good music<BR>-Some of the backstage tape<br />I think the reason it's so bad is because it's on tape, they dubbed almost everything and do so many stupid closeups. It's fine just zooming up on a person every once in a while, but they don't have to zoom in on people's rear ends. They should of had more shots of the whole theater. I've never seen the actual play, maybe it's better than this horrible misfourtune.<br />If the play is better than this, I feel sorry for Andrew Lloyd Webber. The tape ruins the production.<BR>So do whatever you want, if you think it'll be good, get it.
B00006JL1Z|2.0|Let's see, there's Fleetwood Mac Live, released in 1981, Greatest Hits released in 1988, The Chain box set released in the early 90s, the Dance released in the later 90s, and now The Very Best, released in 2002. For a collection that was supposed to focus on the best-selling Mac lineup ever, Mick, John, Christine, Lindsey, and Stevie, can anyone tell me why songs like Paper Doll, No Questions Asked, As Long As You Follow, and Skies the Limit, which were recorded without Lindsey, and Go Insane and Big Love, the live versions with only Lindsey, are on this CD? And whose idea was it to include the boner Family Man? And where's Brown Eyes and The Farmer's Daughter? Not a very consistent set- why leave off Save Me but include Skies the Limit? Save Me was a top 40 hit on the pop chart and a top ten hit on the a/c chart, while Skies only appeared on the a/c chart. It was a bomb in every other format. Anyone that thinks songs like Paper Doll, Family Man, Skies the Limit, Go Insane, and No Questions Asked belong on an album called The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac must not have many Fleetwood Mac albums.

This is music to relax to after a stressful day or to listen to while preparing dinner.  There are layers to the songs that you will begin to hear after several listens.  This points to the depth of the material and its lack of superficial elements that only excite you for a few times until you realize there is nothing there.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Rated R was QOTSA's breakout, and lives up to all hype tenfold. These guys are the saviours of modern rock, and one of the most unique bands out there. Imagine the Stooges crossed with a bit of mid 60s pyschedelia and Tony Iommi on guitar. That's the best description I can give, cos the Queens are everywhere on the sonic map, switching between basically noise (Tension Head) to trippy excursions like I Think I Lost My Headache and (my fav) Leg of Lamb.<br />If you can, get the version with bonus track Ode to Clarissa, that's some prime garage rock. This is the future. Now.
0062502182|4.0|This book was reccommended to me by a stranger, a learned lady whom I met on the bus. When she explained the book to me, my first reaction was another \\"pretend philosophical\\" book. Since she spoke of it so hightly, I bought it any way. The book does not treat you like a listener but more of an observer of events. It does not compel you to self analyze or gives you the secret to life or death but makes you think. <br />I like the book because it stays with you. Parts of it jump at you as one goes about eating, sleeping, brushing, finding truth and earning money
B000068TPN|1.0|This movie butchers an incredible book.  <br />If you (a) think Mel Mel Gibson is a good actor; (b) didn't graduate from middle school; (c) are a racist who finds it possible to believe that the Viet Cong & North Vietnamese fought the war solely by screaming at the top of their lungs and charging like Civil War cavalry; and (d) enjoy cheesy, predictable Hollywood [junk], this movie is for you.<br />If you answered no to all of the above, read the book.
0061020680|5.0|Pratchett thus introduces a new character to the Discworld cast. The utterance reflects the marred midnight entrance of this newcomer when he slips on an ice patch. He is an \\"anthropomorphic personification\\" - a traditionally spiritual figure in [almost] human form. The outburst is in all CAPITALS because that's how important he is on the Discworld - he's Death. We've met him briefly in earlier books, but this one brings his personality to view, and reinforces Pratchett's stature as an imaginative writer.<br />Death's job is not to kill, that role belongs to Fate. Death simply harvests the results of Fate's decisions. No Pratchett character, however, is ever \\"simply\\" anything. Death is far more sensitive than legend would have us believe. He \\"GETS REALLY UPSET\\" at the drowning of kittens, while rejecting any thought of \\"fairness\\" - there is no fairness, \\"THERE'S ONLY ME\\" he declares. While apparently contradictory, these comments reflect the complicated events surrounding the job.<br />Since the role is complex, Death has decided to take on an apprentice to help sort things out. Mortimer, or Mort, isn't as simple as he first appears, either. Mort, still seeking fairness, is sent out on his first solo. His first \\"take\\" will keep you smiling, if not guffawing. Mort's human origins [we don't know Death's] are a pitfall for an apprentice. He fails at completing an assignment, with unforeseen results. What would the cascade of events be if someone who was supposed to die, didn't?  Pratchett examines this delicate issue in very human terms - challenging us to examine our traditional values. He provides a laugh at every step along the way - either in how the characters react to the situation or just through his descriptive powers. No matter - the underlying question remains there for us to cope with.<br />Many mainstream critics push Pratchett into a niche, trying to minimalize his value.  \\"Humorous fantacist\\" is the usual insulting label, one that both misses the mark and reflects the reviewer's superficial reading.  His readers, even if only subliminally, recognize there is more in his work.  Unlike genre \\"fantasy\\" writers, Pratchett doesn't offer a means of escaping reality.  Instead, he thrusts it before your eyes, forcing you to consider how you mean to confront it.  He manages this without the harsh approach of philosophers or pedants, keeping you smiling as you reflect on his offering.  But reflect you will.  If you don't, go back and read him again.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|t.A.T.u. is a great new group.  Like most good music they have been around longer than their music has been in the U.S.  All of the music is different and mixes together nicely into this cd.  A little techno, a little pop.  Their lyrics are deep but still simple and universal.  A great CD overall and the enhanced CD with the music video makes this CD a must have for t.A.T.u fans
B00003CXXM|5.0|I am tired of listening to people who claim that this was a horrible movie because it was &quot;nothing like the book.&quot; If you have actually watched the commentary, you will know that this was intended to be some of the basic plot and character elements of the book brought into a modern setting. Based solely on strong acting (Damon, Potente) and considering all that Liman brought to the film from his indie background, this is an excellent piece of film and should be on everyone's list.
B0000640VO|5.0|Charming, visualy lush, evocative, amusing, touching...this is one of the best movies I've seen in years...perhaps since Cinema Paradiso.
B00006LETU|5.0|As half of Steely Dan, Donald Fagen earned a reputation (shared with partner Walter Becker) as a lyricist of obscure and brutal wit, and a studio technician of rare skill with an attention to detail of a truly obsessed perfectionist.<br />But who knew that, as a solo artist, Fagen not only improve his already-impressive technical skills, but prove to be such a touching and tender songwriter?<br />That's not to say Fagen has whimped out.  Far from it.  But rather than the usual Steely Dan collection of songs about losers, drifters, junkies, and perverts, we're treated to the dreams and longings of a young man coming of age before and after the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br />Remastered for CD from the 1981 digital master tapes, \\"The Nightfly\\" was one of the finest, most enveloping CDs ever produced.  Yet it hardly holds a candle to this new, DVD-Audio presentation.<br />Fagen sings front and center from your middle speaker.  The band surrounds you from the other four.  And the bass from your subwoofer is never muddled, but is sharp and clear and precise as a timpani.<br />To get the full effect, you'll want a DVD-Audio compatible DVD player, and a good Dolby Digital 5.1 sound system.  But even from a regular DVD machine and piddling speakers, you'll marvel at the sounds Fagen produced on his first (and finest) solo effort.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is a very good movie, set in middle-class America, and it would be difficult to classify it as it includes a bit of science-fiction, lots of nostalggy, some action, some drama, etc. etc. The strong points of that movie: an original and interesting story (even if the pace is too slow and sometimes it can get boring), a good cast, a focus on the firemen, on their duties, on the dangers they confront. More generally it can possibly be interpreted as a tribute to firemen and policemen, which is good. Sometimes however, you will get confused as the past and persent are entwined.
B00005JLXC|1.0|Three words: Kingpin is white. I'm not a flaming racist, a psychotic comic book crony, or a disgruntled Marlon Brando. But race does  matter in comic books. Think of Storm--should we make her white? Or how about Wolverine--let's take him out of Canada and put him in Italy! What about Mary Jane from Spiderman? Should she be made blonde simply to pacify the movie directors' lust for a beachwear using bombshell? See? It doesn't work. Changing the race of the Kingpin is the second clue that this movie is a politically correct horror show. (Oh, and Michael Clarke Duncan is about as scary as a giant, angry teddy bear. really. When he delivers tough, terse lines you just want to run up to the big guy and hug him like a two year old with her favorite stuffed animal. Not scary. Not.)<BR>  <BR> The first clue, however? Ben Affleck. Nothing screams \\"Jerry Bruckheimer's (sp?) Errand Boy\\" bigger than Ben Affleck. Because  most male fans can see through his utterly unendearing acting skills (Pearl Harbor, anyone? Or how about Dogma? Shall we run through a list of clunkers?), movie honchos had their addled brilliant notion to open this on Valentine's Day. Why? Two reasons: 1) it would fail in a real movie season, so opening it now gives them a chance to get those people so bored they'll see anything 2)it gives the girls the line, \\"Let's go see something for you on Valentine's Day, like Daredevil!\\" which is girl code for \\"Let's see a crappy movie with Ben \\"Lopez's Cabana Boy\\" Affleck in tight leather and reading lines like he's intoxicated!\\" His acting int his movie is so wooden, Val Kilmer may get another shot at Batman. I mean, he can always argue, \\"Hey, I'm no Ben Affleck in 'Daredevil',\\" and he'd be right (Thansk Mr. Cranky).<br />There are multiple, lesser things wrong with this movie you can see coming a mile away. First, the sham marriage of Lopez and Affleck, which is a last second, desperate grab for attention without talking about \\"Maid in Manhattan\\", \\"Daredevil\\", \\"JerseyGirl\\", or whatever else piece of garbage they're involved in over the next few months . (Notice they seldom talk about their movies nowadays---they can't have too many nice things to say about them). Then, Jennifer Garner, with all the acting ability of wet toadstools, being some kind of \\"smack you over the head with a nuclear powered sledgehammer\\" love interest. She exudes superhero like I exude paint thinner. Then the guy who's best friends with Vince Vaughn makes a glorified cameo as Affleck's visually non-impaired best friend. I mean, honestly, how dumb do you have to be to be best friends with Vince Vaughn? Apparently, dumb enough to be in Daredevil.<br />This movie supposedly has the underlying message of \\"looks can be deceiving\\". It's real message : \\"Don't go see me\\".
B000001GQJ|5.0|I would not protest if anybody called Martha Argerich the greatest pianist of the 20th century -- even if it is too courageous to label anyone with such an unequivocal attribute. But this debut recording of hers (1961), generously on one CD (and for a good price) with astonishing Liszt's Sonata (recorded in 1971) would justify such a claim... <br />Argerich's interpretation of Chopin is flawless, as always. Besides the Sonata, also Hungarian Rhapsody by Liszt is well-nigh perfect. Brahms' Rhapsodies she infuses with sustained power and tangible emotion, while she resists the temptation to play Ravel's &quot;Jeux d'eau&quot; too fast, rather letting the relaxed piano fountains run their spectacular game. Toccata No.11 by Prokofiev is a welcome enrichment, with wildly fast octave sequence toward the end of the piece.<br />This album is a treasure.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is wonderful and Mayer is very talented.  I thought my favorite songs were playing on the radio but but when I listened to this album I found I liked his other songs even more.  I won't get tired listening to this anytime soon.

B00005MP58|5.0|Firstly, if you have not done so, please do yourself the favour of reading the book first.  This is one of the great novels of the language.  I enjoyed it immensely several years before seeing any of the movies.  I have never laughed out loud and let out so many exclamations of shear enthusiasm while reading any other novel.  I am no Janite, having read the novel only twice, but I had high standards in anticipating any movie adaptation.  Please read the novel!<BR>Now I can honestly get to the movie.  This is a great adaptation.  I can hardly be more enthusiastic.  The presence of Colin Firth in this adaptation is wonderful. (I wonder what a young Cary Grant would have done with this role?).  No question I would recommend this one over the 1980's BBC version.  Jennifer Ehle is a delight as Elizabeth.  One word of caution - men may want to keep this away from their wives - mine wore out the VHS tapes I bought when this version was first available, so I had to buy the DVD - and there is the distinct chance you may become somewhat sick of hearing about how wonderful Firth/ Darcy is. (I am much more sensible than my wife, having only watched it perhaps five times in the last half dozen years.)
0312937385|4.0|This was an interesting follow up to Ender's Game. Three-thousand years later, Ender, the hero of the world, is now the most despised person in human history. Often, he is referred to simply as the Xenocide. Ender has now spent his life travelling the stars and has left his infamous past behind. Now he is known as Speaker for the Dead, and goes throughout the Hundred Worlds, speaking the lives of those who have died. But he carries a secret, the last remaining Hive Queen of the world he destroyed. A call from a planet with a life form that seems almost human sends Ender on a mission to prevent the next Xenocide, and to undo the past Xenocide. <br />This made for an interesting read. A lot of the book was taken up discussing philisophical issues, especially Ender's Xenocide 3000 years earlier. Space travel has allowed him to stay young and see civilization change around him. The \\"piggies\\", the race of beings on Lusitania that humans are trying to study, are interesting, but in the end, their way of life and planet seem a little far fetched and the last few chapters require you to suspend disbelief. Still, if you are a fan of Ender, then I would suggest getting this book.
0790729970|2.0|This may not be the best of Carrey movies. Like many Carrey movies, this one is a bit strange sometimes; however it can be good entertainment if you look at it in the proper way: just relax if you can, do not think too much  etc.. I cannot say I really enjoyed watching it, but it has some good points though : excellent special effects.
B000002JNN|1.0|If you are one of those people who simply saw the track listing that included a song called Thunderstruck, Lord have mercy on your soul, because even if you crave that song, the rest of this album very likely doesn't equate to the money you spent on this album. AC/DC was in an absolute freefall after the death of Bon Scott, and this disc is just more proof of that. Here's my breakdown of each song:<BR>1. Thunderstruck: a very strange song, very different from the classic formula they had going in the 70s and early 80s, and for some odd reason, has struck a chord with the general public. It has no real cohesive purpose or story, it's just an excuse to belt out \\"THUNDER! na na na naa na na naaaaa...\\" a chant that has become the call of a generation. Personally, this song grates on my nerves, but I suppose it would be considered a \\"classic\\" because it has been so engrained in the public's subconscious.<BR>2.Fire Your Guns: This song may seem just fantastic the first time you listen to it, but for me, it's deteriorated over time. It reverts somewhat to the fact that Brian Johnson's voice can destroy ANY fantastic guitar work.<BR>3. Moneytalks: a timeless classic...guitar-wise. It's one of Brian Johnson's better vocal forays, but going back to that ruining some ingenious guitar work...he still manages to overpower some great playing by Angus with his voice that strains the definitions of gravelness. Nonetheless, still one of the top three songs on this CD.<BR>4. Razor's Edge: a fantastic opening, has the potential to be a very eerie song, in the league of their earlier work such as Night Prowler, but then, it fails to pan out. Still, a half decent effort.<BR>5. Mistress for Christmas: brutal. Nothing more than that. Look at the other reviews of this album, many of them say that Mistress for Christmas is one of their weakest efforts in awhile.<BR>6. Rock Your Heart Out: awesome. The highlight of the CD, bar none, although it really never gets the recognition it deserves.Brian tones it down a bit on this song, is actually understandable, and is actually bearable to listen to, and the guitar riff is classic AC/DC. One of the top 5 AC/DC songs ever, in my opinion.<BR>7. Are You Ready: Certainly not as awful as some of the other stuff on this album, but proof that AC/DC's best was far behind them. If this gets classified as \\"not filler\\" then it really proves the mediocrity of something like this CD.<BR>8. Got You By the Balls: this time, instead of bad vocals from Brian Johnson, it's really the terrible, stupid lyrics writing that ruins another catchy guitar line from the Brothers Young.<BR>9. Shot of Love: like Fire Your Guns, sounds great the first time you hear it, but then, eventually one realizes that this really isn't that fantastic song. Although this is one of the more energetic offerings from this album.<BR>10.Let's Make It: wow. This and If You Dare are just terrible, in my opinion even worse than Mistress for Christmas. In these two songs, the band falls short of coming up with a great riff, or an immortal chant, or anything really, these are two of the most non-descript songs imaginable.<BR>11. Goodbye and Good Riddance to Bad Luck: contrary to the two train wrecks on either side of it, this song ranks right up there with Rock Your Heart Out as one of the two highlights of this disc. A great, memorable guitar riff, and just a great salute to the blue collar society.<BR>12. If You Dare: sadly, I must refer you to the the comment about Let's Make It.<BR>Overall, this really makes a die hard AC/DC fan like me hearken for the days of Bon Scott and Phil Rudd, when the band had energy, attitude in its playing and one amazing fireball of charisma and wit in Bon Scott. Make no mistake, Rock Your Heart Out and Goodbye and Good Riddance are two of my favourite AC/DC songs, but even they only amount to a star combined when put up with the rest of this album. If you are just an AC/DC fan from what you've heard on the radio, for sure you should get this album, it's got two of AC/DC's most instantly recognizable songs in Thunderstruck and Moneytalks, but if you are a true AC/DC fan, or more specifically, a Bon Scott fan, I'd advise to get this just to round out your AC/DC collection. Just so that when your friend is over and sees you have AC/DC, and since they've only heard AC/DC from the FM radio, asks if you have Thunderstruck, you can pop it in and show it to them. While in your head, you've got some truly great songs playing from the Bon Scott time, the glory days of a great band...
B00003ETOW|4.0|I just had to add my vote for this version over the more recent A&amp;E version.  This is a wonderful film and far superior (I was disappointed in the A&amp;E one since my expectations were so high based on their wonderful Pride and Prejudice adaptation - their Jane Eyre falls far short of that milestone.)  I hesitated to give 5 stars for this film only because of my disappointment in that this DVD has not been remastered.  It is a great film and deserves that effort.

B00003CXXP|1.0|What's wrong with this movie ?? I find it difficult to explain, but there's really nothing appealling in it ... I really had a hard time watching it ... It is also disappointing because it is very different from the other Spielberg movies, which are often very bright. I don't know how I managed not to drop before the end (probably because I was still and again hoping for something pleasant to happen). I really find the whole story exhales a huge sadness. It's very cold too. I just hope to never, never get into such a world.

B00004WG2X|3.0|Firstly, the book is one of the great novels of the language.  I enjoyed it immensely several years before seeing any of the movies.  I have never laughed out loud and let out so many exclamations of shear enthusiasm while reading any other novel.  I am no Janite, having read the novel only twice, but I had high standards in anticipating any movie adaptation.  I would recommend anyone to first read the novel.<BR>Now I can honestly get to the movie.  I enjoyed this version without any real enthusiasm.  I think most of the characters are credibly done, except for Darcy.  I agree with the above reviewers who state that he is too stiff.  In contrast to the magnificent presence of Colin Firth in the more recent adaptation Rintoul gives me no indication why Elizabeth would fall for him, while Firth is wonderful in the role and this consideration just never enters into the equation. (I wonder what a young Cary Grant would have done with this role?).  No question I would recommend the more recent version with Firth over this one.  That being said I wish I had had the chance to see this one first because I would not have been so spoiled by the 4 or 5 times I have watched Firth excell in the role. I did enjoy comparing the two different portrayals of Elizabeth, by Garvie in this one, and by Ehle in the other, because they highlight different aspects of her personality, though I do find Ehle's portrayal both more sympathetic and believable in the other version.  A few of the minor characters I marginally preferred in this version.  Certainly, if one can only afford one version I would strongly recommend the purchase of the other one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
B000002KMV|5.0|Controversy is arguably of Prince's best album.  As soon as you put this number in your CD player the title track comes on and have your foot stomping to the beat. Then there's &quot;Do Me Baby&quot;, what I like to think is the start of a long line of great slow songs by Prince like &quot;Red Corvette&quot; and &quot;Insatiable&quot;.  Later Prince takes you back to the funk with &quot;Let's Work&quot;.  &quot;Private Joy&quot; and &quot;Jack U Off&quot; are also sweet Jams to listen too off this album.  A must buy for Prince fans.  This album is back in the time when everything that Prince put out was good music.

B00005YW4H|5.0|For those of you who have given Norah Jones a negative review you just don't get it.  Suggesting that Jane Monheit or Diana Krall is better than her means you just have no range of style when it comes to Jazz vocals.  Jane and Diana are fine musicians but they don't have the unique sound that Norah Jones brings to her albums.  Norah has a subtle voice that sways you rather than overpowers you.  And her lyrics have more layered meanings within them.  Other vocalists sing lyrics without layers.  Come Away With Me pleads with the listener to go off into her world for awhile and leave yours behind.  What a wonderful journey that is. If you look around a little you'll enjoy yourself while you ride.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Lately, there has been a trend among artists that have spanned the last twenty or thirty years:  greatest hits collections.  The Rolling Stones, the Who, and Fleetwood Mac have all done them.  Now it's Elton's turn.  And if you are a fan of Sir Elton or if you just like musicians with a diverse style, this career-chartering set is worth a listen.  <BR>There are songs for every taste on these two discs.  There are fun, rambunctious tunes like I'm Still Standing, Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, and a recently rediscovered fave for me, I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That. Thrown into the mix are the simple, yet powerful ballads listeners love like Daniel, Rocket Man, and The One.  <BR>One of the most wonderful aspects of this set is the story it tells.  As you read the liner notes, you see that the songs portray the events in the careers of Elton and songwriting partner, brilliant lyricist Bernie Taupin.  All of the sadness, joy, and love and admiration that comes with fame is put out there in clever but touching fashion.  <BR>Elton John and Bernie Taupin are the epitomy of rock and roll.  Listening to the greatest hits is like having a history lesson in musical talent and longevity.  They simply refuse to go out of style, adapting to the changing times while still maintaining humanity and universal spirit.<BR>I will not pick a favorite disc of the two because I love them both.  I have several of Elton's greatest hits discs and love them too, but I'm ecstatic to see so many great ones grouped together for my convenience.  <BR>Some people are skeptical of greatest hits collections because they might not be familiar with a few of the songs featured.  I guarantee that if you have been a fan of Elton since the beginning, you WILL know these songs.  If you have only become a fan recently, lucky you!  You get to experience many of the early hits for the first time.  Either way, this set encompasses a wonderful musical experience.
B000002KLP|4.0|In contrast to a lot of reviewers I think Controversy is a better album then Dirty Mind.  But Dirty Mind in it's own right is a must have for Prince Fans both new and hard core vets.  Once you purchase this album you should get down to the delightful groove of &quot;Uptown&quot;.  After hearing this jam, you too will want to go Uptown.  &quot;Head&quot; is also a sweet jam on this album.  Prince probably used this album as warmup for the hot album &quot;Controversy&quot;.  Both albums are a joy to listen to together.  If you buy one, then you should consider buying the other.

0316776963|4.0|Crazy friends, nutty family... and a way of talking about them that will leave you laughing.  The stories regarding French language lessons in France are especially funny.  Even the Big Boy (turd) piece is a riot, though a bit gross.  Not for everyone, but definitely for those whose sense of humor is a bit tweeked.  Reminds me of two other books with a somewhat twisted sense of humor - \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" and \\"Delano\\".
6300214435|4.0|The most underrated film of the franchise, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is actually superior in terms of action than LAST CRUSADE. Technically a prequel, the film is much darker in tone than it's predecessor, but nonetheless is an exciting entry in the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Night club action, mine car chases and the thrilling climax on a perilous rope bridge, the set-pieces are some of the most memorable in the trilogy. Set before RAIDERS, Harrison Ford is great in one of his best movie roles, Indiana Jones, obtainer of rare antiquities. And this time, it's Shankara stones for the looting, and while the story isn't as original as it's predecessor, it provides some great comic book-style action. Although directed by Spielberg, George Lucas is the creator of  Indiana Jones, and this is one of Spielberg's most impersonal films. However there are some nice homages to JAWS and the \\"Just shoot 'em\\" gag from RAIDERS. The opening Busby Berkley inspired number \\"Anything Goes\\" sums up the pace for the whole film, where the characters go from one action set-piece to the next, with little space for a breather. The female lead Kate Kapshaw (Willie Scott) is not as spunky as Marion Ravenwood, but she's handles being a love interest for Indy and comic relief rather well. There is a notable lack of meaty villians, with Mola Ram not reaching the excellent \\"Bad guy\\" heights of Belloq, but hey, he's still nasty enough. Determined not to make Indy a cardboard character, this one explores Indy's dark side and audience limitations. However despite the change in tone for TOD, there are many laughs to be had and some clever in-jokes, the best of which is the nightclub where Willie sings: Club Obi Wan. Genius. Addmitedly, in some scenes taste goes out the window in favour of revolting animal delacacies and human sacrafice. After all, this was the film that started the PG:13 rating for films that were too violent for a simple PG. But what most critics fail to realise is that it's comic book violence, making it not as bad. John William's tonal score is darker than his previous efforts like E.T, but it's still one of his best. And minor carping aside, they don't make action films like this anymore, where the characters aren't crowded out by a barrage of CGI (THE MUMMY). To put it simply, the action, mine car chases, one-liners and monkey brains all combine to make a really fun action film. And while it dosn't reach the excellent heights of  RAIDERS, it's still one amazing adventure.mic book violence, making it not as bad.

B00005QIPH|2.0|This album is bad, kids. Rich kids from New York who dress snappy put out a mediocre collection of songs that sound nothing like the Velvet Underground or Television, despite what some critics would like to have you believe, and the whole world flips out. Yeah, the Strokes have a good song or two (Last Nite, despite the purposeful misspelling, isn't bad) but all in all, it [stinks]. Plus, that whole \\"return of rock\\" thing is SO annoying.
6305252521|2.0|In truth, I have got very, very mixed feelings about this movie. I perceive it mostly as sad. I would not say that it is great entertainment; it's definitely not a movie to watch if you want to enjoy a good time and to feel better. Instead this \\"psychological\\" movie seems to be raising questions about individual Freedom and Privacy in our so-called \\"modern, Western, democratic\\" societies. Of course this is an important subject, and above all, this is a deep philosophical matter which needs to be constantly debated, because individual freedom can be endangered in many many ways . Naturally, very few things are more important than a person's freedom - and nothing is more precious than happiness I believe. So this movie, well in line with the Big Bother syndromes, raises important questions but does not try to give even the beginning of an answer or of a reason. The real problem however is : what do you believe in ? Do you believe in mankind ? Do you trust yourself ?? Do you trust your neighbour ? How much self-esteem do you have ? How much esteem do you need to feel happy ? How much love do you need to receive and to give to be happy ?? Unfortnately this movie does not provide any clues; it is just describing an absurd life, led by a guy who is a real prisoner inside a sort of virtual nightmare, cornered in a squarely strange bubble. What is very disturbing in this movie is the fact that somebody else decided that this person should be in this place without his consent and even without his knowledge, based on some dubious ethical grounds (here also the movie does not go far in providing clues). In essence it is describing a subtle and dangerous form of euthanasia , the euthanasia of freedom !! So is this movie a call to fight such threats to our freedom, or is it just a cold description or something that may happen, or has happened, or happens sometimes ? That is very disturbing indeed.

B00007FOMP|5.0|Having had the original CD release for well over 10 years, this review focuses on the remastered sound in this edition.  I must say that the bass sound on this recording is phenomenal!!!  When you listen to James Jamerson's liquid lines on \\"Flying High,\\" you'll know why he was the king of his instrument!!  Elsewhere, the remastering brings out little subleties that I had often missed listening to the original CD release.  My suggestion to Motown is that they lower the price of the 2 disc ultimate edition, as it is a little pricey.  With a lower price, I'd probably buy yet ANOTHER copy of one of the top 3 greatest albums ever!!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Indeed, my two favorites for 2002.  Two of the best cd's I own...and I own quite a few!  I have read many of the reviews, some good and some bad.  Here is what you should know.  If you like death metal kill your own mother music, RAP, or anything top 40 you probably wouldn't be here reading this.  If you enjoy the likes of Coldplay, Radiohead, Verve, American Analog Set, Her Space Holiday, Doves, Starsailor, Muse, Elbow, Flaming Lips and I must throw in Jeff Buckley of course for obvious reasons or all of the above, or anything with creativity, then by all means buy this cd.  It may not be for eveyone but it is definitely for those who love BEAUTIFUL music.  Have I ever written a review before?  NO.  Why am I writing one now?  B/C this cd is unbeleiveable and if you like dark slow melodies then you will thouroughly enjoy this.  It is definitely one for that epic lone journey across our great country.  It is creative and simple.  Which sometimes makes all of the difference.
0553382179|5.0|I had tried everything and read every book on organizing and this book &quot;changed my life&quot;.  The first day I started to apply the flylady's principles I started to see a difference and now three months later I am still on the program and my home and life are in order.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is having trouble with organizing books - they are usually written by organized people!<BR>Try this book.  You will never go back to another &quot;system&quot;.

B000006TRV|4.0|Pink Floyd's The Wall is a really great album with unique songs like Comfortably Numb, Another Brick In The Wall Part 2, or one of my favourite Floyd songs: Hey You, but I miss somethig from the most of this album. This is David Gilmour. To make you understand what I mean: as everyone knows, most of the album was written by Roger Waters. But just take a look at some other songs like Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Echoes, or Time - they all were written by the four members (in fact, by Gilmour and Waters in 99%). These two (or four, as you like) men could work very well together, and wrote a lot of great albums. Waters - almost alone - could not write such a great album (Gilmour could: just listen to to The Division Bell). And don't forget: this album led to Waters' secession of the band...<BR>   But to say good things too: it can not be misunderstood what the album wants to tell the world: it tells what violence and dictatorsip can lead to, how can it destroy people's thoughts, minds, lives. It can be felt the most when you listen to Comfortably Numb - but this can be seen in your minds eye all the time you listen to this album, because this - like the band's other albums - can not be and must not be divided into separate parts - including even the two sides of the vinyl or cassete.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot was a surprising movie. I liked the premise and expected to like the movie. What I didn't expect was to be taken into the gritty reality of the lives of the characters. From the grandmother with alzheimers to the brother and father on strike from the local mine, from the cross-dressing best friend to the dance teacher with an unfullfilling marriage, it's the characters that surround Billy that make this story so exceptional and touching. This movie isn't just a story about a boy who dances, it about the dance of life that surrounds him. Truly a touching movie, and yes, boys CAN dance and not be gay.
6305842442|5.0|An effective rendition of Dick's novel, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\".  The brooding mood is set very well thanks in large part to the moving score by Vangelis, which plays nicely off the dark, sombre set.  The plot is intense; Harrison Ford is at his best here.  I don't care much for the unicorn scene, but it's very short and not really awful or anything (it's not nearly as bad as the voice-over on the original release).<BR>Maybe it's because I'm a Harrison Ford fan, or maybe because I'm just a fan of the dark future genre, but for overall entertainment value I believe this may just be the best science fiction film ever made.  To fully enjoy this film, I recommend you read the book first.
B00005NW02|5.0|System Of A Down's album \\"Toxicity\\" is one of the greatest rock albums i have ever heard. With producer Rick Rubin where can you go wrong? The album is one of the best recordings of 2001 and should have won the Grammy for best rock performance or album or something, System of a Down needs a whole lot more attention than they've been getting. True, \\"Toxicity\\" did enter Billboard's album charts at #1 and went on to sell over 3,000,000 copies nation wide, but there are still thousands that haven't experienced the best rock group of the new millenium. This album leaks with killer songs: \\"Prison Song\\" is uncontrollably good, \\"Needles\\" is kick...for sure, \\"Deer Dance\\", \\"Jet ot\\", \\"X\\", \\"Chop Suey!\\", and \\"Bounce\\" all have addictive rifts and lyrics that actually make you think. \\"Forest\\" and \\"Science\\" keep providing that same cycle of non-stop rock that makes you crave more. \\"ATWA\\" is slower than most but is my favorite on the album for being so damn intellegent. \\"Toxicity\\" itself is of course a huge hit, and why shouldn't it be? It has every element a hit rock single needs. \\"Shimmy\\" is one of the best, and can be found on the skateboarding video game \\"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4\\". \\"Physcho\\" is one of the hardest on the album but still kicks... \\"Aerials\\" has to be a close second for the best song on the album, and the \\"Arto\\" or whatever it is indian dance thing is also really cool.If you happened to get the CD-Rom version, it has behind-the-scenes clips, commentary from the group, and concert footage.So, everything i just told you about SOAD's \\"Toxicity\\" all leads back to one thing
B00003CXXM|3.0|I read the book before I saw the movie. The book was AMAZING![.] If you haven't read it you should. Read the other Bourne books,too, there great. The movie was a disapointment to me because of how much they changed from the book. The made Marie German!? I couldn't believe it!! She is Canadian, and a smart one at that. And how did they get to be in love all of a sudden? In the book Jason needs Marie. She keeps him sane. And he saves her life. That is really not so in the movie. And what happened to Carlos the Jackel? He wasn't even metioned in the movie, probably because it was set in the present instead of the 80's. But that was all the book was about! There are so many things different about this book and the movie that this review would be like a term paper if I decided to name them all. <BR>So, if you read the book, don't expect much. If you haven't, you will probably be entertained for the 2 hours the movie lasts.
B00003CXXP|3.0|I watched this movie for the first time on DVD, which I purchased.  I had heard that it was so-so, but it looked like something I would really enjoy.  And I did- for the first two hours or so.  This movie was very well acted, the visual effects are exciting.  I was really enjoying this movie; but it just kept going, and going, and soon it was clear to me that Spielberg had no idea where it was going either.  The plot started to drag, take unsatisfactory twists, ramble around, and then ended ... but didn't, and then it got worse.  I won't even begin to list the technical problems with the ending of this movie, but the cheese was almost unbearable.  It's probably worth watching if you've never seen it before, but please rent it before you buy it.  I'm taking my DVD to the pawn shop, as I'll never bother watching it again.
0380729407|4.0|A mildly paced, philosophical novel by author Ray Bradbury (author of \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"). Bringing out his very wordy and verbose style of writing, Bradbury tells a tale of dream-like, or even better, nightmare-like proportions. Jim and Will, a week under fourteen, are searching for some excitement in their quaint town in Illinois, but what they get is the place they call home suddenly turned upside down. Late one night, the boys discover a night-train coming down the shore. It's carrying what will shortly become a carnival of mystery. The boys can hardly believe their eyes. The carnival filled with sideshows and ghastly dark tents, harbors a cast of evil-natured freaks that have a certain humane charm, winning the hearts of the town folk. Inside the carnival, they find an insane, powerful, mirror maze that casts a spell on the boys' teacher, who later falls victim to the magically twisted carousel with powers to add or extract years from it's riders. The boys find this out, and are soon on the freaks hit list. Nothing is what it seems, friends are being disguised by new ages, and nobody knows who these freaks are or where they came from. But one thing is clear. Jim and Will are next, if they don't find out how to stop them.
0553573403|5.0|I was at first hesitant to read this book; however, it turned out to be not only a worthy investment, but one of the best fantasy novels I have read(and its sequels are even better). It is very well written: the characters are intriguing, the story strays from the cliche and completely draws you in. I recommend this book to any and everyone.
B0000032LS|4.0|This has to be one of the best movie soundtracks ever! If your'e a Rocky virgin or new fan Rocky Horror(like me) &amp; want to hear the music of the film then this is of course is something you should get. I myself am a new fan and hearing all the classics on CD is much different then hearing it in the movie, esp' if you were lucky enough to catch the movie at a local movie theater. Theres really not much else to say on it we all(or should) know that it includes all of the classics(plus a remix) that are shown in the movie except &quot;Sword of Democles&quot;(Rocky's song) which is why I took off a star.
B00006HBUC|3.0|This movie is nothing like the cartoon.  Shaggy isn't suppose to end up with the girl.  How come Shaggy is more muscular than Fred?  When you watch the cartoon, you'll see that Fred does have more muscles if he was a real live person.  Freddie Prinze Jr. muscles doesn't match up to &quot;Fred's&quot; body.If this was suppose to resemble the cartoon, then Shaggy wouldn't end up with the girl.  Fred always get all the girls.  Velma is always the smart one. She isn't suppose to have a &quot;love interest.   The plot line is o.k.  If these four are friends, they are s uppose to remain together and not break up over some silly thung like Velma's jelousy that Fred takes all the credit.
0060090383|5.0|I had previously read Last Chance Saloon and expected some of the same plot lines. I was genuinely surprised at Keyes ability to combine a serious issue with good old comedy. I found myself inside the Cloisters, sitting with Rachel in her sessions, in NYC fighting the urges of drug addiction. Several stories in one, and it was wonderfully woven into an excellent book. A must read!
B000068PQ0|1.0|This release is WAY overrated IMHO!  The music is very cartoonish, with an overabundance of overproduction and ultra-cheesy sound effects!  My final analyis is that Coyne and co. perhaps didn't think the music would stand on its own, so they threw in the extra electronica to provide 'icing on the rotting cake'.  I want my money back!!
B00005TPKD|5.0|Phallus Dei is a psychedelic mind-trip that is light-years ahead of most other releases of the era, e.g., Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, King Crimson (not to say that those were bad albums, just not as freaked out).  One big sloppy stew of a musical melange that lacks only a light show and some love beads to complete the sixties experience.  And perhaps a ticket for your trip back to Earth.
B00005JKO3|5.0|El Cid is an Epic tale from which we can all learn from.<BR>  Heston portrays a person pure of heart who is trying to save<BR>his country from total destruction by bringing their waring factions together to defeat the common enemy from Africa.<br />  He and his followers attempt and finally unite his Christian King and the Muslim Moors to fight the hoards from Africa who were invading their country of Spain.<br />  As I have watched this movie over and over again, one can see a message there.<BR>  Unite regardless of race or religion to make a better place to live.<BR>  The music is also excellent in this film.<BR>  I am surprised the history channel has not reviewed or had this film shown on tv.
B00000ILGB|5.0|Yeti, though largely improvisational, is a somewhat more focused album than its predecessor Phallus Dei.  One can hear snatches of Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, and Velvet Underground, yet it is still uniquely their own sound.  One of those albums that expertly captures the era in which it was produced.
0671027344|5.0|I've read a lot of books and have many favorites, but this book is near the top of my list and one that I'll read again and again even though I never re-read books. I loathe reading books in diary-format, but this book is different and the format really works well with the story. (plus, it's not actually a diary, the main character, Charlie, is writing letters) <BR>After having finshed reading the book (having only starting it the night before) and I was amazed at what emotions it brought up and how it made me feel. I've read tons of books, and I've gotten that feeling of truely understanding and empathizing with a protagonist before. But this is the first time I've read a book and actually felt that I was the character. I know that sounds goofy, but it's true. At first I thought it was because my personality and history was similar to his, but I think that's just how the book was written -the same exact way thoughts run through your mind (he even side-tracks at times.) Charlie's thoughts, are so genuinely honest and unconstrained, it's as if those were the same thoughts you had(or are having)back when you were young and innocent.<BR>     This book is more than just another story of a boy coming of age, it's unique in how well it explains people's emotions (as he also explains the emotions of many other, different characters.) I never cry when reading books, but this one gave me that fluttery feeling on more than one occasion. Silent crying. This book isn't one that you rent from the library to read, it's one you buy since you'll to read it alot more than once and probably read again and again years from now.
B0000085N4|5.0|This album is definetely a classic all-time great album. When a friend told me he saw it was remastered, i knew i had to buy the new one even though i still had the original disc. But alas, after flipping through the liner notes of the new one i realized that it WASN'T remastered at all. How? Because it still says &quot;Mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound&quot; instead of &quot;Remastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound&quot;. And then after listening to it alongside the original realizing it is an exact duplicate of the original. So as far as i can tell, there is no difference between the two except for the expanded artwork. But i guess i'll keep it nonetheless and give my original to my friend.
0156012197|5.0|Oh My gosh, The Little Prince is one of the best books in the WORLD!! and i know, because i have read a LOT of books. It is so good it is almost DEVINE, and i am not exazzerating or hyperbolizing! This book has the sparkle and (almost) magic how children think about LIFE. IT is a very profound book. This book will make you think, if not change your life. This book is SUCH a good book. you may smile, think deeply and you may even shed a tear.
6305181772|5.0|This is a high-tech spy movie that is very good. Cruise puts in one of his best performances and the other actors perform excellently. There is enough variety to keep some suspense going. There is certainly enough action, without having to resort to blow up everything in sight (like some other &quot;summer&quot; blockbusters). The transfer to DVD is excellent and the other sound and editing are very good.
B00006X06U|5.0|For any listener, this orchestral treatment of Mitchell's classic music is a rare and sublime treat. For fans, it's a wonderfully mixed bag. <BR>For those of us who have followed her career over these thrity plus years, the opportunity to revisit her stunning collection is a true gift. Search out your favorites and be prepare for a few surprises.<BR>Firstly, considering her recent health, Mitchell sounds very good. Her upper register is pretty much gone, but her melodious voice is still strong and suptle. From the first, somewhat startling opening of &quot;Otis and Marlena&quot; to &quot;The Circle Game&quot; which ends this double CD, this is a wonderful journey.<BR>If you have a favorite tune, it likely will be here. It will be different, however, so be prepared. Although every one is very fine, standouts include &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot;, &quot;Refuge of the Roads&quot;, &quot;Hejira&quot;, &quot;Cherokee Louise&quot;, and &quot;The Circle Game&quot;. Like all the cuts, these are enhanced and somewhat changed from their original sound by the lush orchestra and in some instances, other voices, especially, &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot;. The stunning &quot;Amelia&quot;, so beautiful originally on &quot;Hejira&quot; is even more so this time around. <BR>Included in the package are pages of her more recent paintings, including vision of the World Trade Center of Sepember 11th.<BR>Mitchell has grown older, and so have we. This spendid release is a true gift to all of us
B000002ITK|4.0|I guess TS is a guilty pleasure.  I've been around metal since about 1980 so I was there when they broke it big.  Therefore I like the older stuff on this disc a lot more than the newer stuff.  Recommended are: 'We're Not Gonna Take It', 'I Wanna Rock', 'You Can't Stop Rock and Roll', 'Shoot 'em Down' and especially 'Under The Blade'.  TS was never a \\"total\\" metal band, not like Venom or Mercyful Fate or even Sabbath or Priest, they just happened to be rockin' at the right place and right time.  But when they got fully wound up they could blast it out \\"fast and loud\\" with the best of them.  There's a few missing cuts on this disc; like 'SMF', a few stinkers, and the live stuff is not really eye-opening.  But this is a good buy for those who need a dose of a heavy metal, New York City, in-your-friggin'-face attitude.  Crack a cold beer, hop in the car and crank it high!  Unless you're a corpse you're gonna be groovin'.  And that, after all, is the whole idea.
B000070WJE|3.0|Warning!  When I bought this from Amazon, it came as one<BR>of the new \\"copy protected\\" not-CDs that have recently <BR>been coming out.<br />These may not play on all systems, especially computers.<BR>(When I tried to play it on my Windows PC it crashed the PC<BR>so hard I had to power-cycle it)<br />Music is pretty good, some outstanding tracks, a couple fillers.
B000063DIR|5.0|Diary of a Madman features for greatness from Ozzy and Randy Rhoads. Randy is one of the best guitarists ever. What a shame he dided so foolishly. That's rock 'n roll I guess. This album isn't as tight as Blizzard of Ozz, but still very good. The title track is the epic. The good tracks far outweigh the bad, and this is an essential purchase for those into metal. Who cares about the re-recorded ryhthm section? It still rocks!
B0000640VO|3.0|I bought the DVD because the film is EXCELLENT. I would have given this 5 stars, except for the following things regarding the DVD production:<br />1. There is neither English dubbing nor subtitles (THIS IS WHAT DVD IS ALL ABOUT), whereas I'm certain at least the latter was done for the film in the theaters. The interviews with the director are less important, and I didn't find them all that interesting anyway.<br />2. There is advertisement for wines (I won't mention the name) throughout different parts of the CD (not during the film, thank goodness). For example, on my CD player I can't interrupt the opening commercial. Impossible to jump to the title screen. I'm obliged to watch it all the way until menu comes up. <br />It's a shame that for such a good movie they had to package it so poorly.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I don't know about you, but I grew up listening to the Beatles and hearing about them from my parents and recognizing the poor efforts of new artists to copy or reinvent what only John and Paul had the ingenuity to create.<br />I hate that when I come to this compilation-- the compilation of their number one hits-- people say things like &quot;this isn't a good collection of Beatles songs.&quot; Okay folks, you knew this was going to be the collection of their HITS, not the underground recordings, not all the songs that made Top 10 but not #1. Did you really think &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; would be on here if you're the big Beatles buff who knows all their singles by release date?<br />The CD is *excellent* quality, beautiful music, wonderful, inventive, genius. Those of you who feel it necessary to bash it just because it didn't include some song that you like and no one else heard of.. you know, they're hoping that, by releasing this album, people will go back and buy the remastered discs. I personally still wish it would have included &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; off of Abbey Road, but it wasn't a #1. I'm more realistic than to expect them just to put it on here for me.<br />It goes from the beginning of their career-- their first big hits like &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; all the way to the later material (my favorite half of the album), the songs like &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko,&quot; &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude.&quot; <br />It covers more than just love, the way most sixties/seventies compilation discs do. It covers the way love affects your life, it covers the media's scrutiny of celebrities, it covers the pointlessness of despair and unhappiness. It's a genuine, soulful, incredible collection of songs, spanning roughly two decades of music. Every five songs or so, you can detect a slight change in the style and arrangement of songs as time went on. But it always works.<br />Anything less than five stars for the Beatles 1? <br />No, I think not. Buy this.. just because your albums are worn out from overplaying the #1's off them!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have never read the books, but in my opinion, I think the movie was truly excellent. I have only seen one movie that is almost exactly like the book (Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets), and don't ask me why, but I was really let down. Don't get me wrong; I thought it was an excellent movie as well; they did not skimp on wardrobe or scenery, etc. but for some reason it disappointed me that they didn't use any artistic merit and went totally \\"by the book\\". I am one of those people that look forward to not knowing scene by scene what is going to happen, and even though I haven't read the LOTR trilogy, after reading some of the reviews other people have submitted on Amazon.com, am glad that The Two Towers was different than the novel. Now I can look forward to reading it one of these days and feel like I am experiencing it for the first time. Besides--if they made movies long enough to encompass everything included in ANY book, it would either end up being so long and drawn out that they would have to split it up into more than one movie, or the pace would be going so fast that the audience would not be able to absorb every detail and get lost along the way. I for one would feel cheated if I had to wait another year (or more) to see a movie that only covered half a tome. So I encourage anyone who has been considering watching The Two Towers in the theater to do so--you will be greatly missing out if you do not. Even if you have an awesome home theater system of your own, nothing can compare to seeing a movie of this scope on the big screen. The beauty and splendor of this series is just astounding!! Nothing Compares!!!!
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club was an excellent book. It touched on an area that not many books usually discuss. It was about Chinese mothers and their American daughter's relationships. It was quite a moving story, and some of the mother's stories were quite woeful. The daughters all had hidden secrets from their mothers and the mothers vice versa. Each chapter was from the perspective of a different character who sat at the Joy Luck Club; a club where a group of women would sit, talk, and play mah jong. The daughters were to carry out the tradition.I found myself able to relate to some of the chapters with the daughters and it was such an alleviation to me that this matter had been struck with such accuracy. To me, this story was a quick relief because it pleased me to know that there was a book that touched on mother/daughter relationships in Asia.
0064407667|1.0|This was the most depressing book I have ever read.  Hardly a children's book.  And certainly not comparable to HP. My 13 y/o could not even finish reading it.
B00005B36H|5.0|the first time this album when into my cd player, it almost brought me to tears. it is beyond me how anyone could make such brilliant music. everything from the albums breath-taking cover (the 'real' one with the skinless man) to the groundbreaking songs on this album are superb. the albums highlights are the thunderous opener 'the grudge','the patient',singles 'schism and parabola' and 'tick and leeches' (my favourite song on the record), but all the other tracks are great to. this is worth every penny you buy it for.
B0000844I8|1.0|How many editions of this hideous movie does the world need.<br />The only good thing about it is Kurt Russell.<br />After an interesting beginning it is downhill for the rest of the movie as JAYE DAVIDSON from THE CRYING GAME tries to play an alien disguised as a man instead of a man disguised as a woman.<br />This movie is ATROCIOUS drivel that delivers only embarrasing lines like \\"There can only be one RA!\\"  (they should not have altered DAVIDSON'S voice, then he could have played another one dimensional drag queen in this travesty)<br />And what is with the CHEAP CGI?  Sorry, but so quick you can't see it doesn't cut it with me.<br />Yes this movie is an atrocity with a cast of thousands.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This time it is a double CD. Six songs. Amazing songs. The songs that no one else could ever write. It is a special album, a gift of true music.<BR>I feel it's needless to review every song. I would just recommend it to anyone. Even if you're not into heavy metal, just skip the track #1 and listen to the rest with no stopping. <BR>A timeless classic, it is that good!
B000071ZZI|3.0|I enjoyed the movie until the ending. I saw some departures from the book throughout, but figured it would still be the same as the book, but then whammo - it ended in such a way as to change the actual story 180 degrees from what it should have been!<br />Why? The book had a great twist to it. Why take this out, and put a predictable ending on it? Even people who have never read the book are making comments on how the ending seems tacked on to the movie.<br />Why even base a movie on a book if you are going to depart from it so much? Why not just write your own original story and be creative? What is Hollywood thinking? - that we can't handle good, twisty plots in movies?<br />I give it a 3 because it was good until the ending, and if you never read the book you will really enjoy it. But I do recommend reading the book if you like good spy thrillers with great twists.<br />Cliff - ...
B000006TRV|5.0|I am a huge pink floyd fan and this is my personal favorite album of their's. Darkside was my favorite and is still great but when I listen to this album in it's entirety I love it. I have to say I didn't like this album the first time I heard it because it sound's so much different than previous floyd records. There are so many great songs on this album especially on the second disk with comfortably numb, the show must go on, in the flesh, run like hell, waiting for the worms, stop, and the trial, all in a row. The first disk has some great ones too. Good bye blue sky, Another brick in the wall 1-3, mother. There are just so many great songs on this album I can't help but have it be my favorite floyd record with darkside and animals close behind. Also see the movie, any fan of this album must check it out.
B00000342V|4.0|This is a great cd, however, if you can purchase the original single cd. I purchased this version for the two additional tracks at the end, however i found they did not exist on CD 1. The second cd's tracks are all thrown out of wack with tracks missing. I have not even bothered to listen to the second cd due to this disorganised mess. This cd is a rip-off as it does not deliver what it says its going to. This only sours a great listening experience for me.
0066214122|4.0|Typical Michael Crighton book.  He does a great job of making the unbelievable seem believeable.  From Dinosaurs in Jurassic park to time travel in Timeline.  But also typical of his novels the end peters out.  The difference in Prey is the build up is not as interesting as some of his other novels.
0446608955|5.0|This is the first book I have ever read by Nicholas Sparks and I have to say this is an awesome book.  I finished reading the whole thing in one night.  I am truly impressed because these are usually not the type of books I like to read, but this one just seemed to  reach in grab your heart, and hold on to it throughout the whole thing.  You will find yourself laughing with them, crying with them, proud of them, and much more as you journey into their lives.  I am just at loss for words on this book.   I am going to start on The Notebook in just a few minutes.  I can only hope it's as good as this one.

The book is a virtual gold mine, a bit difficult to read, but quite complete for the beginner.  We are all having such fun!  You will too.  Whatever your reason for considering this book, just get it.  It is such a worthwhile investment and pays great dividends!  You won't be sorry!
0684833395|5.0|It really is a smattering of all the concepts that makes a great literary work.  Bursting at the seams with different themes, I found Catch-22 to be uproariously funny yet awfully saddening at the same time.  You can be laughing your head off and pitying the poor soldiers simutaneously. <BR>The range of emotions this book displays and yanks right out of the reader is quite impressive.  I'm not a fan of war-related books because it's just not my forte - but Catch-22 is definately an exception.

His style if very readable, and there are plenty of examples to learn from. Also, he breaks down myths and sterotypes of what kind of leader you need to have effective change.

0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down, the absorbing story of the worst firefight for American forces since VietNam, is worth a look. It's a great, engaging read. <br />In 1993, US soldiers, enforcing UN mandates, sought to remove Somali warlord Aidid to aid relief efforts and establish a more democratic government. One autumn day, a Special Forces raid to seize two of Aidid's lieutenants ended with 18 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somali's dead. Mark Bowden examines the various things that went wrong, and avoids blaming the obvious suspects (the commanding general, the Secretary of Defense, the President). Indeed, as Bowden presents it, if the men who fought there had regrets about command, it was not that the casualty-ridden raid was ordered. Rather, it's that the policy that it served was abruptly changed immediately after, making the success of the mission moot.<br />Bowden has a nice style, very straight but very readable. He's not interesting in larger political points but seeks to tell a story and let the world know the bravery of some hundred-odd American soldiers. He's got a great way with detail, weaving it into his stories without overwhelming them. I'm looking forward to whatever topic he grabs next.
6304383177|5.0|When I first saw this film about a year ago, it's pace and silliness were very aggrivating to me! But now I gave it another try, and it is interesting that now I find it to be a very funny movie.  I like Cary Grant very much, and while here he is MUCH different from his sophisticated and polished Hitchcock roles in the 50's, it was quite fun to see him as a sort of bumbling idiot scientist wearing nerdy glasses!  He looks  very sweet actually, and I felt a bit sad when the glasses got broken out in the woods, and he continued on without them for a while!  It took me a while to appreciate Katherine Hepburn too. During the first watch she annoyed me, but in the second watch, I found her airhead ways and speaking style to be very funny. But then I have seen her in some other roles and read some books about her, and that helped a lot. I thought she was just great in Adam's Rib, Philadelphia Story, and Desk Set.<br />Can't really say any more that already hasn't been said, but that it is a fun movie, and if you like either of these 2 actors, then you should enjoy it as much as we do. My 10 yr. old and 5 year old get a big kick out of it too. However, I think the leopard, Baby, is the star attraction to them in this film, not Cary or Katherine!
B00005JLSC|5.0|I've seen this musical at the cinema now three times, once by myself and twice with friends. Clearly, as you can understand, I love it. It's fun, vibrant, well-acted. The singing and dancing are great, and the awards it's sure to win are deserved.<br />The reason I'm reviewing it, though, is to tell you that one friend I brought with me, who usually hates traditional musicals but did like MOULIN ROUGE, loved this movie and wants me to take her to see it again.<br />She explained it well when I asked her how CHICAGO, with its cast of the amazing Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah, won her over.<br />She attributed most of it to the genius plot twist of having all the stage musical numbers occur within Roxie Hart's showbiz-crazed, fame-hungry mind.<br />\\"This time, they only sing because she sees them singing,\\" my friend said. \\"And they sing when it's appropriate. It's not just like some guy's walking down the street and bursts into song, and everyone else around him somehow knows the dance steps. It rocks.\\"<br />The energy level of the film is high, and everyone looks like they're having a great time.<br />That mood is contagious. The film wins you over.
B00004Z459|3.0|I got this CD from a friend and was less than excited about it. I [don't like] Fred Durst and all that kind of [junk]. I assumed this was going to be the same.

B00005RFVL|4.0|Encouraged by his work on the BRIDGET JONES' DIARY soundtrack, Britpop star Robbie Williams recorded this Rat Pack-ish album at the same, famous Capitol Records studio in Los Angeles.<br />All in all, his efforts are pretty good. His voice seems right for the songs, and his use of &quot;special guest stars&quot; like Nicole Kidman and Jon Lovitz on tracks makes the album more fun than other pop star throwback efforts, like the recent Rod Stewart album.<br />However, and this is key, Williams' take on the songs is so authentic that he seems to have excised a bit of his usual dark, sarcastic personality for it. It would've been nice to have a bit of that injected into the numbers.<br />There's nothing particularly wrong with this album. It just doesn't rock out as much as I wanted it to or take the chances that I thought it would.<br />&quot;Somethin' Stupid,&quot; which is the Williams-Kidman duet, is something sweet, though.
B000003C4K|5.0|Truly a genre-defining classic, &quot;Bonded By Blood&quot; IS thrash metal. Featuring the late, great Paul Baloff on vocals, this album shreds away with intense, yet catchy, music. Lots of memorable, shout-along choruses, as well as plenty of neck-breaking riffs! Featuring total thrash classics, sure to get the mosh pit started, such as &quot;Strike of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Metal Command&quot;, &quot;A Lesson in Violence&quot;, and, of course, the legendary title track. Paul's raw vocals serve as the perfect compliment to the band's down and dirty thrash style, which has been imitated countless times. If you plan to get into thrash metal, this should be one of the first albums on your wish list!
B00000G3I2|1.0|The baby boomer as self absorbed, whiny yuppie entered into the mainstream of American culture with this insufferably bad 1983 film.<br />The story is simple -- a group of boomers are united for a weekend stay at a vacation home when they gather for the funeral of a friend.  During this time together they complain about how much better everything (music, etc.) was when they were younger all the while they dive further into denial over the fact that they have merely become the ambitious, materialistic types that they once so loathed.  All of this is topped off with drug usage and spouse swapping (and a Motown soundtrack) to assure themselves that they indeed have not morphed into a smug, self satisfied version of the people they once rebelled against.<br />This film launched a whole slow of boomer nostalgia pieces and even a few Generation X copycat movies (the equally dreadful \\"St. Elmo's Fire\\" springs to mind) proving that while the baby boomer generation might not have a monopoly on self absorption, they certainly know best how to corner the market on it and profit handsomely from it.  Pass.
0312305060|5.0|i can't remember the last time a book tore into me so deeply (and i read A LOT). michael cunningham constructed a book of such intricate beauty, and intimate, significant musings - that it's difficult to even know where to begin.<br />you can read the editorial reviews to piece out a synopsis of the plot - yet the plot almost feels insignificant in comparison to the sweep of emotion the novel left me with.<br />the clever way he weaves the stories of the three women together (virginia woolf, mrs. brown, and clarissa) is fascinating, but \\"clever\\" is hardly the word i would use to classify this book in any way.<br />i was simply struck by the interior monologues of the women in the book... their thoughts on life and death have a touching truth to them - i felt as though michael cunningham had drilled a whole into the inner depths of my psyche, and found the words to describe what i've been thinking all along- thinking, but lacking the patience and the drive to map it out so clearly.<br />i have yet to see the movie, but the previews send shivers down my spine.  it will be incredibly interesting to see how a novel immersed im the interior makes its' exterior transformation onto the big screen.<br />aside from my personal musings on how the book spoke to me, etc, it's well worth the read- it's a beautiful book filled with passages worth committing to memory, and although it is experimental in its' own way, it isn't pretentious or difficult to read.<br />i rarely close the pages of a book feeling as though i have somehow changed, but in this case i did.

0375703861|3.0|\\"White Teeth\\" is an outstanding performance for someone who started on this book at the age of 21, on her last year at college. More than a million copies sold is a proof of its success. Her style is exuberant, witty, with clever and satirical overtones. Although Zadie Smith affirms that a book is a \\"suitable place for ethical enquiry,\\" and she certainly touches on a number of issues (technology, science, religion), she never really takes a firm stand or attempts to elaborate on any of them in a profound way so that it would stand out as the cornerstone of her novel. What does the teeth metaphor really stands for? Her characters are funny, entirely familiar, and sometimes overfetched. They are not heroes, but rather comic stereotyped players in a multicultural environment. The main players are individuals in desperate search of cultural identity, of roots, of auto-affirmation. In the process they are driven to radical outlooks, whether in religion, militarism, science, or social activism.<BR>The structure of the novel as a whole lacks a pivotal string to hold all the pieces together, and the ending is poorly crafted. There is no doubt Zadie Smith is a gifted writer, whose talent nevertheless requires further polishing and maturity. It is a set of teeth, albeit beautiful, in need of braces!
B00006LLNV|5.0|Having seen the film and also being a big Elliot Goldenthal fan, I am very pleased with the soundtrack CD. Normally I don't care for songs mixed in with the orchestral score of a film on an album, but this one for me is a real exception. Goldenthal has written his score in a way that seemlessly flows between the songs creating a veritable musical dreamscape that is \\"Frida\\". <br />Die hard orchestral soundtrack collectors may not take to all the songs that are intermixed, but those who buy soundtracks for the songs they hear in films won't be put off by the score nestled in between. <br />Bravo/Brava to Elliot Goldenthal and his wife, director Julie Taymor for creating such a captivating film, one in which the music plays a role of such great depth and character.
0780631684|4.0|Before I watched Final Destination, I dismissed it as just another teen horror flick not worth watching, but when I finally got a chance to see it, I was surprised by how refreshing the film was to the horror genre.  The plot (which may seem a bit ludicrous, just a bit...) is that Alex (Devon Sawa) has a premonition that the plane he and his class are boarding to France is going to explode.  After getting kicked off the plane with some other students (including Ali Larter and Sean William Scott), the plane does explode, but as we soon find out, Death hasn't forgotten about Alex and the others.  One by one the survivors are picked off by an unseen force that causes elaborate causes of death, some of which are eerie, and some others just plain ridiculous.  Veteran X-Files director James Wong carries the film at a nice pace and has a surprising sense of urgency and dread as we watch what happens to the survivors, and Sawa is surprisingly good in his role as the man looking for a way to find a pattern to cheat death.  The ending however is obviously just a quick thought of glued on afterthought to pave way for an inevitable sequel (which is due out soon) and hurts Final Destination's overall score; however the alternate ending included on the DVD I find a much, much better ending and it has a bit of emotional impact that would have really set Final Destination above and beyond the countless heap of unoriginal teen horror films of today.  With numerous nods to other films of the genre, Final Destination is a fun thrill ride that is much better than I expected it to be.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Walt Disney was fascinated with the story of Treasure Planet and had actually opted to do it as the first full length animated film. He then realized it didn't need to be animated and did Snow White. He kept thinking about a way to do Treasure Island as an animated movie and eventually made it as the studios first live action film. Now, the Disney team has come up with a brilliant way to do it as an animated film. They set it in space and it is my favorite film version of Treasure Island. I know it did horribly at the theaters, but so did Cinderella and look at how well known that is. You will love Treasure Planet if you liked the book or the live action version. The best part would have to be B.E.N, a crazy robot on Treasure Planet who is clearly missing a few pieces and is voiced by Martin Short. Plus the ending was so cool and original! Definately not the typical cute musicle Disney is known for doing in the past.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I've been collecting Laura in various languges and enjoy her singing in Italian most of all. I was suprised this was as great as it is.

Incredible story telling.
B00000IO4I|4.0|&quot;Little Voice&quot; is a strange little film.  It is based on the play &quot;The Rise and Fall of Little Voice&quot; which was written by Jim Cartwright specifically and most deservedly for the talented voice of actress Jane Horrocks.  However, given what I have seen in this movie there must be some significant changes with the last act of the story from what appeared on stage.  The story basically falls into three stages, which can aptly be described as the discovery, rise, and fall of Little Voice.  This is the nickname of LV (Horrocks), the painfully shy daughter of human hurricane Mari (Brenda Blethyn), who takes refuge in her room upstairs listening to her father's record albums.  On the few occasions when she actually utters words it is indeed in the littlest of voices and we are genuinely surprised when she actually makes eye contact with another human being.  Trying to do more than that is young Billy (Ewan McGregor), who is smitten with the shy young woman.  Meanwhile, Ray Say (Michael Caine), a seedy third-rate manager of fourth rate talent in the entertainment biz blows into town to have some good times with Mari and he proves to be more than her equal in terms of having a very good time.<br />Then, in one of those scenes that delightfully catches us by surprise, both Ray and the audience learn that LV might not talk, but she can sing.  More to the point, she can sing like the singers on the records she listens to, which means we are talking Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey, Billie Holiday, and other music icons.  Ray has dollar signs in his eyes that blind him to the obvious amorous affections of Mari as the big question becomes how to get the timid LV upon on the stage at the club of Mr. Boo (Jim Broadhurst).<br />The rise part of the story is the most enjoyable as our anticipation builds for the moment when LV is going to let loose with all those voices she keeps bottled up inside.  Of course, once that happens there is nowhere to go but down.  Ray coaxes LV into the big moment through dishonest means, which is a portent of what is to come.  Caine's performance is marvelous from start until the final act of this film, at which point his character throws away all of the good grace he has developed over the course of the film.  Our sympathy is totally with LV, who is always singing in her mind's eye to her long departed father (special mention to Graham Turner for the perfectly wonderful smile on his face), although young Billy's earnestness wins our admiration as well.  By the end of the film LV's career and a whole lot of other things are in ashes.  The ending of &quot;Little Voice&quot; is rather unsatisfying, but to paraphrase the Bard, I am not sure what satisfaction it could provide us from where it begins.<br />Blethyn got a supporting actress nomination for her performance in this film and Caine's performance is what of his better efforts, but the reason to watch this film is Horrocks.  In the end your biggest complaint with this film is going to be that Horrocks does not do a lot more singing.  I understand the importance of the key line that LV finally gets to delivery to her mother, but I cannot help but feel that there should have been an equally important moment from the musical perspective.  &quot;Little Voice&quot; is worth the watching, but if you find yourself only rewatching the middle section, do not be tremendously surprised.y coaxes LV into the big moment through dishonest means, which is a portent of what is to come.

I'll tell you why.<br />The previous book, &quot;Built to Last,&quot; was good, but as Jim explains in his preface, people still didn't know how to get there from here.<br />I admire two things in particular about Collins' work.<br />1. He demonstrates good leadership by humbly acknowledging his team.  He even includes a picture of them!<br />2. The team's passion for research brings us closer to a scientific explanation of corporate success.<br />The principles they discovered can be applied to big companies, or to individuals.  Big or small, you can benefit from this book.<br />Last point- Bring a pen and paper.  This book'll give you enough ideas for the rest of the year.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Okay...here is one of the happiest, brightest, and most pleasantly positive films in a long time.  Legally Blonde is not only superbly cast, carefully directed, and perfectly paced but supports the &quot;many levels of intelligence&quot; theory. Not only does the main character, Reese Witherspoon- neophyte attorney Elle<BR>Woods possess social and personal knowing, but discovers within herself (in her quest to snag her exboyfriend)an intellectual component that amazes and delights. It's a CINDERELLA story with brains, beauty and spirit. <BR> Being a current educator with many degrees,  I think it is high time the academic world gave up some of its self-absorbed opinions regarding the traditional value of book learning and emphasis upon  test scores  and gave  equal credit to &quot;lessons<BR> in life.&quot;  Legally Blonde can help us take a &quot;new direction.&quot;<BR>Incidentally, I believe you'll love the music.....  included are current artists with a nice variety of sounds, rhythms, and genres. &quot;Watch Me Shine&quot; by Joanna Pacitti is a favorite and you'll hear &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot; by Vanessa Carlton frequently on the air.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt is like a bottle of fine wine - it gets better with age! This band has evolved into something great. They've gone through a lot; they've changed a lot and have become a better band because of it. They're innovative. They're not afraid of exploring new ideas or mixing different genres of music together, because they know they have the capability of making it sound amazing. <br />Most of the songs on this album are great. However some stand out more than others - `Hey Baby', `Underneath It All', `Hella Good' and `Platinum Blonde Life' just to name a few.  `Hey Baby' is just plain fun to listen to. It's got an appealing beat and lyrics that stay in your head for days, and no matter how hard you try to get rid of them you can't. `Underneath It All' is my favorite song on the album, mostly for its originality and great lyrics. `Hella Good' has the best beat out of all the tracks, and not to mention the best music video.  <br />Light, upbeat, fun and definitely worth a listen!
B000069CWE|1.0|I'm not exactly current on the latest music scene, but I know what I like and what I don't.  If you are into Rap and Hip-Hop, you might really appreciate the re-mixes on this CD.  If, like me, you thought Hybrid Theory was awesome because of the driving rock beat MIXED with SOME Hip-hop sync, and heavy guitar chords that put the green light at a drag race to shame, skip this CD.  It is like someone went into these tunes and deliberately ripped out all the stuff I like, replacing it with a bunch of rented-Rap.  Serious disappointment.  I hope they swing back the other way on their next effort.  If not, I'll have to find other tunes to lift to.
B000002UA0|4.0|For a while, I got into Pink Floyd. I had about 3 albums and thought they were the coolest thing. Then I became an idiot and said they.... Then, my friend Michael played the Ummagumma live album, and I got back into them. I decided to start with the 1st album. This, my friends, is where it all begins. This is when the band weren't a big progressive rock band with songs about the evils of the music industry. This was when the band was a excellent sounding pschyadelic group that wrote songs about..um, i'll get back on this one. Never with any band have i seen such experimentation on the lyrics. They range from space exploration to eastern philosophy to bikes. Huh? Here is a review song-by-song:<br />1.Astronomy Domine-From that crackling voice on the radio to the strange guitar notes of Syd Barret, you know you're in for a treat. One of the more stranger songs from Floyd, it's a lot more instrumental than the other songs. Live, this song was incredible. While not as great as the live version, it still is a great album starter and a great 1st song. 5/5<br />2.Lucifer Sam-Very catchy riff, and some strange lyrics about a siamese cat named Sam. This also has to do with Syd's girlfriend, Jennifer. Another strange tune with some great bass work by Waters. 4/5<br />3.Matilda Mother-A great pop tune that sounds like it was influnced by the Byrds, but then screwed around with by Syd. Live, the song would go on for 15 minutes, but luckily, it's only 3. Very good singing by Rick Wright. 5/5<br />4.Flaming-A decent song by Syd. Nothing spectacular, except for the bridge and the \\"CUCKOO!\\" sound on the 2nd verse. 2/5<br />5.Pow R. Toch. H.-The best song on the album. Very experimental. Weird psychadelia and jazz collide on this one. Personally, I think Roger Waters is great when he screams. Real weird. 5/5<br />6.Take Up Thy Stephescope & Walk-A pathetic song by Roger Waters. Well, it was his first song, so, he had a long way to go. 1/5<br />7.Interstellar Overdrive-Quite extraordinary. A great descending guitar riff than goes into a weird freeform noise jam. Syd's guitar tone is just magnificent on this song. Some of Rick Wright's finest playing. Nick Mason also knows how to intensify a song. 5/5<br />8.The Gnome-On Side Two, the weirdness dies down a little. Based on The Lord Of The Rings, this is a cute fairy-tale kind-of song with a touch of strangeness. Ok. 4/5<br />9.Chapter 24-Very VERY 1960's song with lyrics from eastern philosophy. Nice chorus. 3/5<br />10.Scarecrow-Complete filler. Just when the song starts to get interesting, it ends. No good. 1/5<br />11.Bike-OH YEAH! Just kidding, this song is great! Very strange song about a woman and bikes, mouses, and musical tunes. At the end, there are some very strange noises followed by a horrifying humming sound. A great way to end a great album.<br />This was just the beginning of Floyd. Sadly, it was the end for Syd. As we all know, he went further into madness and hasn't recovered since. I'll miss you, Syd.

Why on earth is the record label leaving out some other &quot;righteous&quot; hits which were not included already in the previous best-of compilation?<BR>Where is that great sound of MOUNTAINS or GIRLS &amp; BOYS?<BR>Why I COULD NEVER TAKE THE PLACE OF YOUR MAN and NOTHING COMPARES TO YOU did not make the tracklist this time?<BR>Is GLAM-SLAM or WISH YOU HEAVEN too much for the average audience?<BR>I do not give a hoot about BATDANCE, the duet with kim Basinger  and 7 being left out, but PARTYMAN and the great duet with Sheena Easton on ARMS OF ORION?<BR>And a last one: THE MORNING PAPERS is Prince showing off creativity and the guys at A&amp;R leave THAT out????<BR>It's only a 3 star review, should have been a 9 one...
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist is flat out one of the scariest movies ever made.  The story of a twelve year old girl who is possessed by a demon still sends chills of horror down your spine even after repeated viewings.  Director William Friedkin perfectly combines all aspects of horror from the psychological to the gross-out that doesn't just evoke screams or makes you jump out of your seat.  The real terror comes from watching a mother see her daughter being taken over by an evil spirit and not being able to anything to protect her.  Ellen Burstyn is marvelous in the role of Chris McNeil and Linda Blair gives the performance of her life as Regan McNeil, the possessed girl.  Ms. Burstyn relates both compassion and fear as she wants to help her daughter but is being broken down by the constant abuse that the demon heaps on her.  Both Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow are excellent as the priests brought in the perform the exorcism.  Mr. Von Sydow's Father Merrin is the elder priest who refuses to be shaken by the demon, but Mr. Miller's younger Father Karras is having doubts in his faith and seeing young Regan only serves to riddle him with more angst.  The film was a major triumph, becoming at the time the all time highest grossest movie in history.  The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture, Mr. Friedkin for Best Director, Ms. Burstyn for Best Actress, Ms. Blair for Best Supporting Actress and Mr. Miller for Best Supporting Actor, but only took home two awards, one for Best Sound and the other by William Peter Blatty for Best Writing, Screenplay based on another medium which he adapted from his own novel.
6301966155|1.0|Gosh, now i know not to judge a video by its cover! When i rented it i thought it would be good ( practically anything is good with Anthony Hopkins ). When i watched it all throughout the film i kept thinking \\" Shut that girl up!!!\\"! She was awful along with her father!! So much of the material was the same cliche!!! Especially from The Exorcist!! Take my advice, don't waste your money buying or renting this movie!
B000000OQF|5.0|What we have here is one of those cd's no matter what type of music you venture into later on in life, you will always consider this a alltime favorite. Fueled By Jack Daniels, Cocaine , heroin and the night life of the sunset strip scene. Guns n Roses played out there brand of sleazed out rock n' roll to a sissy glam/pop scene that was to busy trying to wow A&R reps to play anything close to what rock music was always about. Appetiate for Destruction wasnt anything orginal in any sense. Listen to bands like Dead Boys, Rose Tattoo, AcDc and NY Dolls to find that out. But its safe to say, for what they did, they did it the best. Go Out, Pick up a bottle of J.D get in the car and blast Nighttrain while you go 95 mph, and then tell me you dont see why this is a great record. This is one of the best live fast die young records ever. If this is your thing, you already know to get this one
B00005JKZT|5.0|To justify my title -- I'm a nerd.  I've always been a nerd.  I'm kind of proud of it.  Solidly in the nerd camp, me. Okay?  Okay. ;-)<br />Most of the complaints I've heard against this film are from people who are upset because it doesn't follow the plot of the books exactly.  And it doesn't.  It is not a letter-by-letter adaptation of Tolkien.  (When was the last time you saw a film that was?)<br />A film is not a book.  And I say this as someone who 1) did in fact read the trilogy and 2) Is usually the first to moan and complain when movies are not totally faithful, a habit I needed to be meticulously trained out of over the course of years:<br />Book to film translation, like translation from language to language, is never merely the extension of the original.  Exact translation (as the teach us in Lit. Crit.) is impossible.  You're working with a new  \\"language\\" -- signs, signifiers, connotations -- new raw material, which must necessarily give you a new end result.  It's the creation of a work in its own right, and the only fair way to judge it is -- is it successful of a piece, unto itself?  And is it faithful to the spirit?  And this film is.  It SO is.  It is a *good* film, well-plotted, well acted (only the teeniest bit campy :-), and logical, with important, timeless, universal themes, and it gives you the *heart* of the Tolkien text, if not all the details.  (And actually, it gives you a much higher percentage of the details than you'd imagine, if you only judged by the angry people.)<br />You talk to people who've seen the film but haven't read Tolkien, and get their reactions -- the reactions are very consistently the same ones that I have gotten from reading the books. The noble hero who looks beyond his own ambitions (and well being) to serve the greater need of his people/sovereign/world.  The leader who recovers from manipulation/corruption to do his duty by his people.  The trials of temptation and the slow corruption of power. The leader who recognizes the fallibility in his own first judgment in time to do the right thing.  The neutral party confronted with a time where neutrality must be abandoned.  Loyalty, honor; despair and the overcoming thereof.  And all the naturism vs. technology and so on.  A friend of mine -- who had not even known Tolkien was Catholic --  went on at great length, and with great excitement  (you should have seen the light in his eyes), about \\"the Marian imagery and themes\\" in the film after having seen it, and how the film \\"made him feel like a better person for having seen it\\".  AND.... he's gone out to buy the books -- not only the trilogy, but tons of other Tolkien works and apocrypha.  This is a friend who is \\"not into fantasy\\"  (you know those), a friend I had to BEG to see \\"Fellowship\\" for about a year.  I kid you not.  (And he's proselytizing his little nephews and nieces. It's a little scary, actually.)<br />Dudes, they *get* it.  The magic is there -- I've seen it in so many of my friends' eyes. The path to it is *slightly* different, but not enough to take anything away from its merit.<br />Frankly, we purists make up the loudest contingent of LoTR fans -- but not the biggest. Not by a long shot.  If we were the only audience, the film would've flopped.  Instead, it's beating out Harry Potter (who-HOO!!  YES!!!) and bringing a new generation, nerd and non-nerd alike, :-)  to the written works of Tolkien.  Jackson is passing on the essence of Tolkien to a much broader audience, and he's doing a dang good job of it.  And I say hear hear.  Five stars for that alone.cognizes the fallibility in his own first judgment in time to do the right thing.  The neutral party confronted with a time where neutrality must be abandoned.

0316666343|5.0|I know some people who did not get past the first 70 pages or so, and I can see why:  at first there is a seeming dispassion about the narrative voice and the tension builds slowly at first.  It gains momentum and pulls you in, however, to the point that you will stay up long past a reasonable bedtime on a weekday night to see it through to the end.  And if you are the least bit prone to reacting to a book emotionally, well, you will be reacting.  It crosses age and gender barriers in its appeal.  It is easy to see why it continues to float on the bestseller list.<br />What slowed me down at first was what I thought was its singular plot line; then I realized that each character forms his/her own subplot and their individual projectiles weave about the story like so many contrails streaking and crossing around the sky.  Sebold is to be commended for the risks she takes in an age when few take artistic risks in literary and popular fiction.  If some don't like her choices, well tough, she was courageous to try and I like that.  Her biggest risk was to find life affirmation amidst the tragedy-a 14-year-old disappears, the victim of rape and a gruesome murder, her body never found-without undercutting the undeniable changes it wreaks in the lives of those left living and the sadness of a life frozen at age 14.  The balance she strikes is remarkable.
0060537639|5.0|I'm not sure if the reviewer from Publishers Weekly read the same book I did. This was an entertaining, well supported, and well written work. Menzies goes beyond many other &quot;history-lite&quot; books not written by academics by offering plenty of support and evidence for his theories. The strongest is the physical evidence--wrecks and artefacts that are clearly Chinese in origin found in VERY strange locations (so historians--how exactly DID they get there? I'd love to hear some of your theories *smile*). <BR>  The evidence he presents that later explorers ran across Chinese colonies in the new world is not quite as strong--many of these explorers came back from the new world with some pretty fantastic tales, so I'd take these with a grain of salt. <BR>  When I finished this book I was convinced. I highly doubt that events unfolded exactly as Menzies spells out, but I am certain that something similar happened. He has done a good enough job that I think it is now up to the haughty academics to try to come up with some other theory that will fit the evidence that is clearly right in front of their faces rather than sit in their ivory towers and hurl conceited and blind snubs down on this book and its author.
B00005JLD2|5.0|Its hard sometimes to think that we are part of the human race, especially when we encounter the most inhumane programs we have enforced on our fellow man. It makes you want to slink away into the jungle and mayhaps emerge on the other side and with any luck, all the bad things we have wrought, will have vanished!<br />But, as docudrama's unfold we are again brought to the fore to witness yet another crime against each other. Rabbit-Proof Fence is such a docudrama, as we see the gov't of Australia take half white aboriginal children away from their mothers arms and send them off to schools to be taught to be domestics and to be parterned with other breeds to cull out the aborigine blood in three generations. The great men who thought this up would have fit in with Hitler like a glove.  And to think that this program did not end until 1970s is beyond belief. And the present government of Australia does not offer any condolences for the program.<br />The people of this offensive program were and are referred to as 'The Stolen Generation'<br />Molly and Gracie are sisters and one day they are snatched away from their mother by the police like animals and along with their cousin Gracie. They are taken hundreds of miles away to be trained as domestics, and to enter a breeding program to retrieve all the white genes and breed the aboriginal gene's out. Kenneth Branagh is Dr. Neville and in charge of the program and you will not like him very much. All the children at the camp call him \\"Dr. Devil.\\" The girls escape and trek some 1300-1500 miles back to their ancestral village, their ages are 14, 8, and 10. Molly remembers someone saying that the rabbit fence at their home runs the from coast to coast and they head for the outback in hopes of finding that fence. They meet some people along the way who are nice to them and head them to the fence. There is a hunt for them and no one can imagine how they have made it 600 miles away, but they cannot catch them. Every trap theyset the girls get away.<br />Molly's mother hears of her daughter journey and she and the grandmother set up a vigilance at the rabbit fence and meditate and sing a mantra and wait for the girls to return.<br />There are some scary moments and the girls have much hardships. And you will be amazed at the acting skills of these three young women.<br />At the end of the movie no one wanted to leave we all hung around the theater, really not knowing why, but, sadly everyone finally started leaving the theater and no one was talking...<BR>ciao yaaah69 I gave this 5/5
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones is truly a gem in the world of contemporary pop and in the more specific world of contemporary jazz. Too often the artists who have inherited the Jazz legacy of Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Benny Goodman have turned to the elevator music styles much in the fashion of Kenny G and others. While the tempo of Norah Jones does not match the speed or precision of those aforementioned greats, it is a far cry from the pathetic \\"contemporary adult jazz\\" that has ruined jazz. Bottomline: This girl has talent.
B00005K9LN|5.0|To give an album 5 stars, it's got to be a damn good record, and &quot;British Steel&quot; is! If I were asked to name the five best heavy metal records of all time, this one would without doubt be mentioned. &quot;British Steel&quot; was released 1980 and in my opinion this album had something special that other metal acts at that time didn't have - the powerful unique guitar riffs that made Judas Priest easy to recognize. The songs on &quot;British Steel&quot; are both very heavy (at least by that time) and melodic. Judas Priest deliver their strongest material ever on this one - everything is top quality. There are songs that have very high hit potential (&quot;Breaking the law&quot;, &quot;Living after midninght&quot;, &quot;United&quot;) and of course they became hits more or less... There are other songs that goes straight to the heart of a fan of old time traditional heavy metal (for example &quot;Rapid fire&quot; &quot;Metal gods&quot; and &quot;Grinder&quot;). There are in fact no weak song at all on this album and my advise is: run out and get a copy as fast as possible, this one sure stand the test of time, perhaps better that any other record of that era!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is a great example of what's been lacking in the hard rock world lately; A kick-a** band with a singer who has real vocal ability.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I guess most (older) metal fans already have this record but for those who don't I suggest you buy it today. Van Halen's two first releases are about as good as hard rock can get. The songs are very well written and well performed, and there are indeed no &quot;fillers&quot; on this one. Edward Van Halen plays amazingly and did have a very big impact on the whole genre, and singer David Lee Roth has a real rock 'n' roll attitude that you can feel without even seeing the guy.<br />It's interesting to notice that during the guitar solo's there's no rhythm guitar added as it usually is (even for bands with only one guitar player) which in a way gives you a feeling of what the band sounds like live. Listen to the record in headphones and you hear the unique seperation of instruments.<br />This debut album and the follow up &quot;Van Halen II&quot; are easily the bands strongest effords and after that I guess the dynamic between Roth and the Van Halen brothers became a source to conflict instead of creative musical masterpiece. The third release &quot;Women and children first&quot; sure have it's moments but can not compete with the former two. After that Van Halen made a couple of decent, but not excellent, records before the original band broke up. Roth was replaced by Sammy Hagar and even though Van Halen from time to time managed to write great song the magic was gone, and Van Halen became a metal band among others.
B000002BVN|3.0|One must admit that Michael Jackson is one of the most profound artists of our time. He is one of the very few survivors of the 80's music scene, that's enough evidence of how important he is. He is a self proclaimed King Of Pop, child prodigy, artistic visionary, and a very controversial personality, his everchanging look says it all. In 1995, Michael celebrated almost 20 years as a solo artist with HIStory, an explosive musical masterpiece with two, not one, 15 track discs, one of which was a compilation of his greatest hits. In 1997, Michael celebrated the success of HIStory with HIStory In The Mix. <BR>Blood On The Dancefloor, the title track, is a groovy dance number. Michael at his best with a new style of lyric writing. The song tries to copy off the murder mystery theme of Smooth Criminal and the sassiness of Billie Jean, and somehow it works just fine! Morphine is an expiremental extraordinary track loaded with powerful guitar work from Slash. Superfly Sister is a low key groovy R&B number that, in my opinion, is one of Michael's most underrated songs in his history. Ghosts and Are You Scary? are both taken from Michael's short feature, Ghosts. The songs are cool but copy too much off of past hit Thriller. It seems that Michael's obsession with ghouls and zombies haven't worn off since the Thriller video.<BR>The rest of the tracks are remixed numbers of HIStory tracks. Let me just say that the original versions of these songs are far far better than the remixed versions. That speaks for my review of the rest of the album. It should have never been made. I doubt that Michael is in need of remixing his songs for commercial appeal. He is a commercial on his own!<br />Recommended for the five 'new' tracks.
B00005R62N|4.0|This is a very good record and could be regarded as some kind of &quot;best of&quot; for the period prior to &quot;British Steel&quot; (Judas Priest's best album ever). When it first came out I believe it was the magazine Kerrang that called it &quot;Unleashed in the studio&quot; and I suppose they were right. I even think Judas Priest have admit that the only live thing about it is the drums - everything else is re-recorded in a studio. Maybe that's the reason the sound quality is so good, the guitars are even split. In fact I don't mind this &quot;cheat&quot; since I don't really see the point in releasing live albums...
B00006J3WH|4.0|I have this CD and it is really enjoyable. The only thing that I would like Angel had been there and sang, but it couldn't be, either way, I really like the CD.
B000005RFQ|1.0|&quot;Born Again&quot; may be Black Sabbath's weakest album. The production is so bad that it's almost impossible to kind of talk about the actual songs. I guess some of the tracks would be much better with a proper production, at least we might be able to hear the different instruments and not only this &quot;blur&quot; that sounds like a very bad demo tape. If you're not a dedicated Sabbath (or Ian Gillan) fan, stay away from this one. If you are... I guess you already own this album...
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne has an amazing sound and a great raw voice. I think that though her songs are over played, they are still great to listen to. <BR>As to the fact that Avril sometimes sounds like Alanis Morrisette, I think that for some unknown reason a lot of singers are beginging to sound like great artists from the past. Shakera is beginging to sound more and more like Jewel and Michele Branch, Vanessa Carlton, and Natalie Umbura all sound alike. If you're gonna point fingures at Avril because she sounds like someone else, well so does everybody else! Avril has her own sound and she does have her nitch on the music world.<BR>   Unfortuneatly I do not as of yet own this CD but am looking forward to purchasing it in the near future.
B000002KKS|5.0|&quot;Heaven and hell&quot; came out the same year Judas Priest released their &quot;British Steel&quot; and Motorhead &quot;Ace Of Spades&quot; - 1980. These three albums are among the finest metal records ever to be released. On &quot;Heaven and hell&quot;, Sabbath could write songs with a different vocal structure since singer Ronnie James Dio by far is a more skilled and competent singer than Ozzy Osbourne. This time Black Sabbath sounded like a whole new band, and most of the songs should be regarded as classics. In fact there are only two songs (&quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;Lonely Is the Word&quot;) that doesn't have the same calibre as the rest.<br />In fact, Sabbath had a freshness on this release that sadly were gone by the time they released the next one - &quot;Mob Rules&quot;. After that Ronnie James Dio left the band to form his own self titled band Dio, and Sabbath got Ian Gillan (Deep Purple) on vocals and released an even worse album with the most misplaced title &quot;Born Again&quot;.
0780627024|1.0|This film, while masking itself as cute and harmless, attempts in its own subtle way to completely trash and impune traditional moral values.  Unfortunately this film does not show the consequences of Pleasantville's new found freedom.  Broken homes, shattered lives and a society doomed to disaster.  Dont be fooled.  This isnt a harmless fun flick.  Watch the film then ask yourself, \\"Are these people really better off?\\"
B00005JLZL|4.0|I saw an advanced screening of this movie, and I really found it to be thought provoking and powerful.  Spacey and Winslet gave great, believable performances.  Some of the editing threw me off, which kind of detracted from the the story.  I had become very interested in this story and was pulled into it, then the way in which the movie transitioned between present and past pulled me back out.  In spite of that, I really enjoyed this movie.<BR>  I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I won't give details.  But my favorite part of the movie is the Govorner of Texas - a striking resemblance to GW.  It was a nice touch.

B00005JLSC|5.0|A movie with a character named Roxie Hart would have to be the favorite movie of a writer named Roxy Hart.  I loved this movie.  Renee, Richard and Catherine amazed me with their singing and dancing ability. Especially Renee.  There doesn't seem to be any limit to what she can accomplish.<br />Many are familiar with the story of a woman who murders her lover and then is subjected to all of the surrounding publicity.  This movie gives that story a bit of a spin, making Roxie an aspiring singer (taken with her idol Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays a wonderful Velma) and murdering her lover who supposedly can get her into show biz but has just been using her for sex.<br />The fun begins when Richard Gere, smarmy lawyer agreed to take on her case, because she has $5,000.  This is a role that Gere was made to play.  Gere reeks of slickness and shiftness in the same manner as Johnnie Cochran.  (I almost expected Gere to say something like \\"If it doesn't fit you must acquit\\") Roxie's trial itself is turned into showbiz.  And how true it rings, given the recent spate of celebrity trials from Winona Ryder to Robert Downey Jr. to the epitome of it all, the OJ trial.  I loved Gere's tap dance; great symbolism for the fact that the truth means nothing - it's all in the presentation.<br />John C. Reilly, who plays Amos, Roxie's husband, is worth noting. His sadness at his wife's trial, is unfliching loyalty and his reaction to his wife's indifference over his love for her are moving. His major number is \\"Mr. Cellophane\\", which is simply a showstopper. It is poignant, sweet, unassuming and simpe, without all of the glitz and glare that surrounds his wife.  A running joke is that Flynn continualy refers to \\"Amos\\" as \\"Andy\\", except one time and I won't spoil that part for you because it is funny.<br />Queen Latifah shines as Mama, the prison matron who is not above being bought.  She really only gets one big musical number which is excels at.<br />Unlike alot of musicals, the music in Chicago is used to advace the story, not interrupt it.  The fact that most of the singing and dancing takes place in Roxie's head are an effective way of telling the story without making it too talky. This was sheer genius on director Rob Marshall's part.  All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango and Roxie's theme are standout numbers, as is the scenes where Flynn is dangling the press like puppets in \\"They Both Reached for the Gun\\".<br />The overall message in all of this is that fame is fleeting and you better do what you can with your 15 minutes of it because you can be yesterday's news just like that.  One minute you vsn be front page news, the next minute your face may as well be on a milk carton.<br />Chicago does great justice to Bob Fosse's vision.  It already won three Golden Globes and some Oscars are probably just around the corner.n Chicago is used to advace the story, not interrupt it.

B000002HK4|5.0|This was my 1st intro the Dream Theater, and I'll be honest: the thing that drew me to the CD was the covers of Zeppelin and Deep Purple ... was I in for more of a surprise. I had heard all the talk of how great Awake was, but never got around to buying it, and as I'm typing this in right now, I have When Dream And Day Unite playing ... anyway, as for the covers on here, the Zeppelin covers are immaculate, no butcher job on godly Zeppelin tunes, the best covers of Zeppelin I've ever heard. And Perfect Strangers? I can't stress to you how amazing James's vocal range is, unless you hear this cover of this great Deep Purple song. This guy's voice soars like no other singer I've ever heard, and I'm into a lot of power/melodic metal bands that pride themselves on the fact that the singer can carry a passage for an hour. They've got nothing on this guy. A change of seasons, 24 minute long epic masterpiece, will thrill your brain out of your head just as much, if not more, than the covers. And the ending medley of tunes strung together, are a perfect end to this perfect album. These covers were done live also, which is even more of a display of the musicianship that this band possesses. Make this your 1st DM inrto, and then do what I did: get Awake next (10 stars on that one), and go right through every release. By the time you get to the live stuff these guys put out, you'll be speechless. Drums, guitar, bass, vocals, keyboards, all instruments played like they should be: to a flawless jam. BIG TIME 5 ***** STAR DREAM RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB! Don't miss out on this band if your into ANY progressive, power, or melodic metal/rock. Cheers!

B00004TH7Z|5.0|My title above really says it all: if you loved (or even liked) Seventh Son of A Seventh Son, you'll love this new Maiden for the 2000 years. I got this the day it came out, and almost three years later, it still rocks. The only dissapointment I had, was that I was so energized by Bruce coming back that I was expecting a Powerslave or Piece of Mind. Not to take anything away from this release, it's a Maiden must, but if you're looking for that earlier Maiden sound on the two earlier releases I just mentioned, you won't find them here. This album ranks right up there with Seventh Son, Somewhere In Time, and above Fear of The Dark, without a doubt. Bruce is definitely back on this one. I hope the next studio album gets back to the more Power Melody sound, that LP's like Powerslave had. Picks: every song after track 6 jams like hell, but I think EVERYONE will be cranking Nomad for the next 10 years: that tune just Jaaaammmssszzz! ***** 5 STAR BRAVE NEW MAIDEN RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB! Cheers and UP THE IRONS!

I enjoy a wide range of films, but tend to enjoy movies that stir the imagination and the soul. <br />I have watched this film twice and found myself uneasy (as others have written about this film), but not from the \\"tension\\" created by a genius at work, but rather from wondering why I am putting myself through this laborious film. Actually the second time I watched the film, I was simply unable to get myself through it all. I gave it a second shot because I thought that maybe I missed something the first round.<br />While I believe the acting was wonderful, the dialogue, and story line was so languid in its delivery that it is literally painful to sit through. <br />This movie is supposed to be about the darker side of ourselves and how this aspect of our split psyches are repressed and hidden, but are ever lurking under the surface. The main characaters, played by Tom Cruise and nicole kidman, find themselves performing a dance of sorts, exposing candidly the desires that we also share, but are unwilling or afraid to give into. The Tom Cruise character finds himself meandering through the underbelly of the city, walking into a world that he knows very little about and is very very dangerous. There are moments of sexually charged scenes they are tasteful and well done, however, the long winded scenes simply outweigh any of the movies noteworthy elements. <br />Ultimately we can see a resolution by the characters as they understand that the more dangerous elements that reside within the human dialectic can be expressed without destroying those who mean the most to us, as well as ourselves. <br />This subject is absolutely compelling in every sense of the word, unfortunately Kubriks attempt to portray these aspects of humanity falls way short. <br />The pretentious may feel compelled to heap many accolades upon this unworthy slop, but I would rather call it for what it is; A bitter dissapointment.<br />If you do buy this or rent it,just to see how awful it truly is, take out a second movie so you can enjoy the rest of the evening.
6304342160|5.0|I think my brothers reaction to this movie summed it up perfectly. He thought I was trying to get him to watch some low-level lesbian B rate movie. He appologised later, after he unglued himself from the tv and the couch. This movie grips you in the first minutes of the show, and keeps you there and deeply into it right through to the end. I always wish the movie kept going, and let you watch these two amazing characters blaze on. It is now nearly 5 years since I first watched this movie, and to this day I am eternally grateful to the guy who first showed it to me. This is perhaps my favorite movie of all time, or at least it ranks right up there with the few other favorites I have. The action, dialogue dn chemistry of the script, filming, and acting is just superb and and gripping in ways that few movies today are. Watch it over and over.. because this movie is one of the best!
B00007E8V4|5.0|according to system of a down this is not a b-side album nor are these songs rejects as so many people call them.  it does not matter how you slice it, SOAD are on a run and when a band hits their run, you cannot lose and system are a amazing band full of intelligent lyrics about everything under the sun from consumerism to car jackings (and the fact that they are amazing musicians does not hurt).  what is so great is that they use odd time signatures and off kilter beats to spice up the soup.  this is another winner from a band that is a sure thing
B000005JA8|5.0|I'll keep it short... just wrote this review to give this Masterpiece a higher average rating. It surely deserves it. I can understand that not everyone gets into this album (sometimes you really have to LISTEN to music and do NOTHING else than that for 80 minutes...), but so many bad reviews - I couldn't believe it!
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This second album by Rufus Wainwright is a stunning achievement and sublime follow-up to this musical genius's first release, though I grudgingly welcome listening to any song after the peerless track from his first CD, FOOLISH LOVE.  How can you improve on such sheer beauty and perfection?  And yet Wainwright does just that with his song POSES, the title track, and the brilliant confessional in CIGARETTES AND CHOCOLATE MILK: &quot;Please be kind if I'm a mess.&quot;  At present writing, POSES, an '01 release, is currently sold out in Los Angeles at Tower and Amoeba.  Go there and just mention it to the salespeople at either store and witness their uncanny enthusiasm, their singular joy at the talent of Rufus Wainwright.  I'm bowled over completely by both his CDs --- I've never heard such original material, singing, phrasing and musicianship in many years.  In POSES, substance prevails over image despite the surprising lyric, &quot;There's never been such a grave a matter as comparing our new brand name black sunglasses all these poses such beautiful poses makes any boy feel as pretty as princes...&quot;  How could this not stir the envy of Morrissey, Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd-Weber and Johnny-Come-Lately, John Mayer?  What a mind, what a talent, what a gift -- POSES -- and the icing on the cake?  Rufus' cover of John Lennon's masterpiece, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE.  Sir Elton --- you should be phoning up Rufus Wainwright in my humble opinion.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has definitely matured. Her talent has definitely shone through all the bad publicity. She has taken time off and emerged with a more inspirational, more personal album. To me, that deserves a grade of the highest quality. I found that the album is really about the issues that we face as people. After all, Christina is a person and we all have our issues. This is her time to empower us, and in the face of it all let us know to keep going. I think that I doesn't matter if you are a guy or a girl you can find some song that expresses what you want the world to know or see. I love \\"Beautiful\\" and maybe that's because the song has no color, no sex, no orientation, or any label attached to it. If only we knew that the labels and stereotypes don't matter, we would be a better world. That song is including of all... letting everyone know that they are beautiful, and they should never let the pain of this world get them down. <br /> KUDOS, Christina...<BR> She's not your average teen pop artist, but more of a woman who declares that she isn't changing herself for anyone.
B000002H97|2.0|This is the point when Bob Rock comes in and begin to destroy the band artistically, but with the intention of making them rich.<br />Bob Rock was a guy that worked with a lot of hair metal bands. That´s his reference.<br />Maybe he and Lars and James figured it out: &quot;Well, we had enough of writing highlyy complex, with intelligent and varied riffing and strong metal songs. Maybe we can make the same amount of money (or much more) by writing slow-tempo, falt and faceless songs that seem all the same, and people will fall for it, and we´ll not have to use our brains so hard to make the marvellous compositions we used to write&quot;<br />THat´s it, folks. Like someone said below, this was the &quot;beginning of the end&quot;. One year eralier I sold my copies of this album, of LOAD, RELOAD, of S&amp;M album and even the GARAGE INC. (due to the new covers). Yes, I bought them all, because I always had hope that they would find their way again.<br />Metallica, a band that made his name by ripping-off the British  heavy metal bands, at least could write great tunes. Now, they are just a souless band, cold, indulgent. At least Jason Newsted got out in time...
0790736918|5.0|Well, Ethan Edwards, the loser ex Confederate officer knows all about fighting, the Indians, his tricks, the territory... So, you can suppose that if somewhat bad was to happen, he will  achieve a triumph over all dangers. This uses to be in vulgar movies, but \\"The Searchers\\" is by nothing vulgar. For what? Well, the answers are several, the magnificent landscapes, the actors, but I think over all it's the story with Ethan's contradictory personality. At first he rides a lot to get to the ranch of his brother Aaron, but there's the case in these house  exists a conflict by nothing unknown to him because Aaron's wife loves Ethan who feels he must pay his own brother for staying at the ranch and so, after a long wandering, he has to sleep scarcely only one night in the ranch. Certainly there's an apparently external  powerful reason: the cattle stolen by the Indians. The reverend wants to recruit Aaron to prosecute them, however, Ethan imposes his hard character and he goes in the place of Aaron abandoning the ranch in a first search of the comanches, I think very possibly suspecting that really these are a stratagem of Scar, the Indian chief, as his nephew Martin Pawley also fears in spite of his inexperience. This suspicion accomplish in full, and while the ranch is without defence, Aaron, Martha, his son and a few later, his daughter Lucy are horribly killed by the Indians and so it begins the main part of the movie: the searching of the only survivor, the little Debbie. This takes years to do, a lot of penalties, enemies, heat, cold, hunger... and although Ethan and Martin get to find Debbie, these are a Pyrrhic victory because the girl is yet more a Comanche squaw than a white woman. The fight isn't by far a fairplay and the hate of Ethan toward the Comanches  reach peaks of madness. The very end is also discomforting, and after the terrible search, Ethan ends out and alone as he began. Nobody needs yet his abilities and he's forgotten and more than possibly, asfeared as loved by all. A magnificent movie and a masterpiece of all genres.
B000059ZLH|3.0|Like others have said, I give this 3 stars based solely on the quality of the DVD.  The music is incredible; the visuals look like they were put together by a middle school television production class.  ... give me a widescreen edition, with real stereo sound, and I'll give you five stars.  I'd rather just throw the triple-live CD version of this album in the player and crank it up, because this is hard to watch with all the visual [stuff] they throw in there.
0553260111|4.0|This book took me six months to read. Not because i am a slow reader, but because i had other things to do, like read books for school. (Never ever ever read Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim) Because i would put the book down and pick it up several weeks later, i would often lose touch with the plot. This does not detract from the story, however, and in this department, Ludlum deliveres an action packed thrill ride. It seemed that I could actually feel the mental and physical turmoil of Jason Bourne. This book is a good read. Not &quot;Beach Reading&quot;, but more of an in-depth read. Ludlum is like Clancy in that respect. If you lose track of what he's saying, you'll lose the entire book. All in all though, it was worth the six months i spent to read it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Having met an Easy company veteran who is portrayed in this original HBO series, I was pleased to hear him say that the producers had done a good job before I saw it.  And when I DID see it, I was pretty much stunned at the level of detail they put in the effort.<br />These DVDs cover the training, deployment, combat action, rest, and then the end of the war for the veterans of Easy Company, along with additional material on the making of the series and the guys themselves.<br />With so little attention being paid to World War II in most American classrooms today, it is a shame that the whole series can't be shown and discussed, with the details about why certain thigns were done the way the were shown, what prompted some of these things to happen, etc.  This series is rich in detail, writing, and is a completely satisfying package.<br />This effort again makes me truly awed as to what the demands of combat can be, and what it takes to remain a beacon of hope to others around the world.
067144901X|5.0|This book is a favorite in our house.  When I ask my 16 month old to bring me a book to read, she almost always brings this one.  She laughs at the sounds the animals say and loves the \\"3 Singing Pigs Sing La, la, la\\" part!  The words and pictures are simple but cute--perfect for a toddler.  There is rhyme, rhythm, and silliness--all musts for a good toddler book.  It's been a fun read for us and is highly recommended!
0151006903|5.0|While reading, I want to run away from   everyday life. When I was young, I loved fairy tales, myths and legends. Today I love Baudolno. This book transferes me into another world, another time where I met different people.<BR>Eco, with his unique imagination, interweaved the life and the death of Fridrich I and the life of fictious Baudolino. Big and small historical facts, banal and bizzare details from medieval life, West and East expertly exposed with a lot of humour and irony, in a playfully connected story. Could the history be like this? Eco reveals big truth about historical truth.<BR>Read this book to meet Baudolino and his friends whose motives are not ordinary and mundane. Characthers of this novel really cheered me up. What aims! What means! What a contrast to today's materialistic and consumeristic world.<BR>While I was reading the book I laughed and entertained myself, but at the end I was left in dilemma. Should I laugh  because history  is mocked, or should I be sad because Baudolino still searches his Utopia. If you are philosophiclly minded find the answer by yourself, reading Baudolino.<br />I agree with some reviewers that the novel has some flaws, like unnecessary crime story and too developed fantastic journey, but they are minor in comparison to original and provocative ideas enveloped in amusing and peculiar story. My rate is maximal.   <br /> After Name of Rose and Foucault's Pendulum  I thought Eco is a good and interesting author, but after  Island of the Day  before and Baudolino, he became my favorite one.
B00005A1VG|5.0|AND IT'S IN TECHNICOLOR!<br />Why hasn't MGM/WB and Ted Turner made a definitive version of this classic on DVD? This movie competed against \\"Gone With The Wind\\" in the 1939 Oscar race. For the love of Richard and England, just look at the cast to see why; and just watch the movie to see what great movie-making is all about.<br />A script that begins in frame one and doesn't let up until the final credits roll; a cast that was almost everybody who was anybody &lt;who wasn't working on GWTW {with the exception of Olivia deHaviland> in Hollywood at the time; a score that UNDERSCORES the action wthout overpowering it; and a final version that is among the most arguabaly perfect motion picture ever made.<br />My title of this review asks \\"Does it get any better?\\"<br />The real question is \\"Has it ever been DONE any better?\\" This is a violent movie. Lots of people die from a well-placed arrow. Yet the blood and gore is non-existant, although the point is well made. There's love and romance romping through the greenwood, yet all the performers are fully clothed, but erotic gets a new meaning when Flynn ascends to deHaviland's chamber, and they make love standing up, fully clothed, but you don't miss a whit of what's REALLY going on!<br />This is cinematic story telling at it's finest! A beginning, a middle, and an end, with a climax that will rattle the rafters!<br />Buy it. Watch it. Love it.<br />You can't go wrong.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is arguably the best record Prince ever published. When people \\"intertwine\\", eg have sex, and produce  \\"the future of the nation\\" in princess' belly, it's funny, it's strange, it's a bit out-of, but then, that's what Prince is all about.<br />Let's intertwine, let's go by Prince's invitation to be his keys of the board, I don't worry. We will never have any war if we stick to the master's philosophy. WE WILL BE AT LOVE.<br />Just listen to the last tune, where the master begets his anthem of \\"Let's just be friends\\", and youy will be gone forever. Musically, this record is about 30 lightyears away from any other record you listened to recently. The master is absolute. He knows how to entice us. He knows how to shock us.<br />The best record of 2002 is Prince's The Rainbow Children. No doubt about it. And the way the other guy plays the drums! And the way the singer sings! And the back-up choirs! And the breaks! If you want to live a life that's fulfilled, get familiar with this music.<br />By the way, my daughters, aged 8, 7, 4 love this album, too. It's human, it's funny, it's just great.<br />Prince, if you're listening: THIS is the best album you produced ever. Keep it going strong. Count with me as you rediscover the world of music.
0375414053|3.0|As a working Mom, I identify with the tongue-in-cheek humor and frustrations of Kate...BUT I think this book misses the point made so beautifully in THE GRAVEL DRIVE by Kirk Martin (a MUST READ for ALL PARENTS!)....that our children have amazing and wondrous hearts to be explored...that will satisfy us (and more importantly, them) more than any career track or other pursuit. If you want to really understand the heart of a parent and a child, read The Gravel Drive. Then you'll see this work in a whole new light.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Whoever said that putting a hard rock band and an orchestra together wouldn't work is [wrong]! S&M is full of great Metallica songs, such as \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", \\"Enter Sandman\\", and \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", as well as newer Metallica music like \\"Devil's Dance\\", \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\". And putting Michael Kamen and the SF Orchestra in there was the one ingredient that made S&M great!! I admit, I don't care too much for classical music, but this CD is probably the best CD I've ever listened to! If Metallica is getting old, they sure ... didn't show it, and the SF Orchestra mixed in very well with the group! I cannot say enough good things about this totally [great] collaboration. The only thing about S&M that could be different is...\\"The Unforgiven\\" is not on it...however...the songs that ARE on S&M are great songs. I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO METALLICA FANS OF ALL AGES!<br />...
B000002J23|4.0|In 1978, Yes came out with Tormato.  Although not a bad album, it wasn't one of Yes's best and indicated that the band had ended its most creative phase.  After Tormato, Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left.  What were the remaining members (Steve Howe, Chris Squire & Alan White) to do?  In perhaps the most interesting move in Yes's history, they combined with \\"new waivers,\\" The Buggles.  Actually, the Buggles consisted of two men, keyboardist Geoff Downes and singer Trevor Horn.  In 1980, this lineup of Yes came out with its only album, Drama.  It holds a unique place in the Yes discography, being the only album without Jon Anderson.<br />All things considered, this is a good album.  Over twenty years later, the songs still sound fresh.  Trevor Horn is no Jon Anderson, but he does a reasonably good job.  Geoff Downes may lack the virtuosity of Rick Wakeman, but his unpretentious style is a nice change from Wakeman's.  The lyrics are a little darker (\\"run like an athlete and die like a dead beaten speed freak\\"), but on the other hand they lack the sappyness that you get with an Anderson CD.  The best songs are Machine Messiah, Into the Lens and Temps Fugit.  The latter became one of Yes's few top 40 hits.  None of these songs is an epic in the style of the \\"classic Yes\\" phase, but every song is good.  There is some outstanding playing as well: Squire is phenomenal in Tempus Fugit, and Howe likewise in Into the Lens.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I must admit to not being very familiar with Philip Glass' music, although being a movie fan I'm sure that I've heard him before. Sitting through the monumental film, &quot;The Hours&quot;, you realize that this music is a flawless marriage of screen and soundtrack, and immediately, after the film ended, I found myself in the nearest music store, soundtrack in hand.<br />&quot;The Hours&quot; weaves a complex tale of the seemingly intermingled lives of three complex women, all dealing with various internal crises at significant points of their lives. Virginia Woolf, Clarissa Vaughn, and Laura Brown lives orbit around each other, as each feels their lives are insignificant, yet their significance reigns supreme around the lives of the other, hidden, deep, penetrating.<br />A film of this calibar requires an equally complex, moving score, and Glass not only provides it, but inspires the movie. Each piece illuminates and frames each scene without imperfection. In the theater, you sit in awe at the methodical action on the screen as your ears hear the fluid, grand movements and it's as if Glass is reading the mind of the audience scoring the movie as you think it should be. It is impossible to imagine this movie without the music, and the music without the movie.<br />While it is impossible for me to select a favorite piece among all of them, for this is a soundtrack which each pieces lends autheticity to the next, I must profess a love for the second track, &quot;Morning Passage&quot;. There is a section towards the end of that piece when I was listening to it, I literally stopped what I was doing and listened intently, and then replayed it several times before continuing, a very strange act indeed.<br />I highly recommend this work: the emotional depth and honesty, the sadness and enlightment it provides is truly revolutionary.
B00006RAKP|5.0|There may be one or two hits missing, but if you had to condense everything into a twin CD offering this would be it. And at the price of a single CD, it's a steal. The UK version seems a little more rounded than the US, and includes the wonderful 'Blue Eyes' which starts Disc 2 and is a serious ommision from the US release. Disc 1 will be replayed to death by Elton fans and new listeners alike because frankly it is absolute perfection.  One of those definitive soundtracks of the 70s.<BR>Buy and enjoy.
6300183971|4.0|David Lynch and commercial films don't usually go together. However there are some exceptions ( Blue Velvet ) but this was one of those flops. It's hard not to see why. Dune is such a huge book to cover that it would take 8 hours to film ( as Lynch once said ) and naturally film goers didn't get it. I've watched it and I have to admit, I was close to calling this a [weak] movie because it was so tedious and preposterous but I gave it time and it came around just in the nick of time ( the last 30 minutes ) but having watched it a few times more it does tend to grow on you and is a surprisingly good film<br />New Lynch fans should probably start at Mullholland Drive - start from his latest and work their way down.
B000002I4S|5.0|Compared to \\"Blue Train\\" or the spiritually themed \\"A Love Supreme,\\" John Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps\\" is a pretty straightforward record, but it also ranks high among his best. It sets the tone with the fast paced title track, which speeds through with some tight playing by John, who is supported generously by his band. Only a killjoy with deaf ears would resist tapping their toes to \\"Cousin Mary,\\" while Coltrane is on top of his game in the 7-minute \\"Syeeda's Song Flute,\\" and he mellows down in the soft and gentle \\"Naima.\\" Apparently, there's a \\"deluxe\\" edition of \\"Giant Steps\\" available, but I understand that version doesn't have the remastered recording that appears on the original CD. If you're a stickler for sound quality as I am, then I'd personally skip the deluxe edition and get the original release. As a bonus, we also get alternate takes of 5 album tracks, all of which are equally good even though the production is slightly different. In my opinion, \\"Giant Steps\\" shouldn't be the very first CD to get if you're new to John Coltrane (you should perhaps grab \\"Blue Train\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\" first), but it's still one of his vital recordings.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk To Remember is one of the best books that I have ever read. I also really liked A Bend In The Road. Nicholas Sparks is the best author.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Quite simply put, the hooks on this record are enchanting.  T.A.T.U.'s book of music ranges from neo-rock to pop infused techno beats that are as addictive as any beat coming out of Detroit's techno houses.  T.A.T.U. takes the techno come pop formula that made Moby and to a greater extent Basement Jaxx so popular and put a soft touch on its finish.  Some songs like \\"Malchik gay\\" are formulaic, but the record redeems itself by the sole fact that \\"All The Things She Said\\" is on it.  T.A.T.U.'s work ranges from the generic to the refreshingly original.  While not as salable as Basement Jaxx, this disk surely heralds another original voice into the realm of techno.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead is the most innovative and talented band producing music.  They are like a river flowing and progressing.  As with all things that revolve, there are agents of resistance who for some reason think it is their duty to keep things stagnant or dry.  That is the easy road--the one that is the easiest to follow.  But for those of us who take the risk of riding the progression of music as an art form, Radiohead envelopes with each note and rewards with each listen.  The people who feel that Radiohead stopped releasing good music after OK Computer a couple of generations ago would have probably claimed that the Beatles stopped releasing good music after A Hard Day's Night.  For all any true fan of great music cares, the people left on the shore can slip in and drown or die of thirst.
0385503954|3.0|Book I of Atonement was the best. McEwan does a fantastic job in describing chaos and scenes in the nursing ward. Some of the language is quite beautiful like:<BR>\\"He thought he had no expectations--until he saw the beach\\"<BR>\\"He could not spit or swallow, he could not easily breathe, and he could not think. Then, at the sight of the farmer with his dog still waiting patiently under the tree, it came back to him, he remembered everything and he turned to look back. Where the woman and her son had been was a crater. Even as he saw it, he thought he had always known. That was why he had to leave them. His business was to survive, though he had forgotten why. He kept on toward the woods.\\"<BR>\\"...he now had a memory in the bank and would be drawing on it for months to come. He was drawing on it now, in the French barn, in the small hours.\\"<br />These were a few of many beautifully written passages. The passages that I thought were sort of juvenile or workshoppish (mostly poor metaphors) were:<BR>\\"A solitary sunbather in his underpants, facedown on a towel, had patches of uneven sunburn on his shoulders and legs--pink and white like a strawberry and vanilla ice cream.\\"<BR>\\"With a wild hollering yodeling sound, like Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan, he picked up the clerk from behind in a bear hug, lifting him eighteen inches clear of the ground...\\"<BR>\\"They lay on the far side of a great divide in time, as significant as B.C. and A.D. Before prison, before the war, before the sight of a corpse became a banality.\\"<BR>\\"Half a dozen twenty-five-pounder guns were piled beyond the ditch, as if swept up there by a heavy bulldozer.\\"<BR>\\"He appeared to her like a giant chess piece.\\"<BR>I think the war scenes are described very well. McEwan is a master at moving characters around from spot to spot. At most, I adore the relationship between Robbie and Cecilia and enjoyed the rejection letter written to Briony. Didn't like her character from the beginning to end. Lastly, I had a difficult time feeling the 30s. It was hit or miss. It has so much potential, but doesn't quite make it.
B000063DFN|5.0|I'm rather new to Iron Maiden, but far from new to the world of Metal.  In all honesty, I started to like Iron Maiden while playing GTA:Vice City and hearing Iron Maiden on the VRock station.  I am a huge fan of Ozzy, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Pantera, etc.  But I was getting interested in Iron Maiden and a friend suggested that I start with Powerslave.  They were very right, this was an excellent introduction to Iron Maiden.  These songs set the style of the 1980s, you can hear similar styles found on Metallica's 1986 release Master of Puppets.<br />1. Aces High - An incredibe song about an air raid, starts a little slow but then picks up and completly blows you away. 5/5<BR>2. 2 Minutes To Midnight - The song that got me started on Iron Maiden, a total classic of a song. 5/5<BR>3. Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) - A little weak as instrumentals go, I have to recommend Metallica's Call Of Ktulu or Orion instead of this.  This is still a solid song however. 4/5<BR>4. Flash Of The Blade - Another hard-core song, very solid guitar and vocals. 5/5<BR>5. Duellists - Seems to be a continuation of the previous song, has the same theme as fighting and the same intensity. 5/5<BR>6. Back In The Village - One of the weaker songs of the album, however still a good song. 4/5<BR>7. Powerslave - The title track, one of my favorite off the album, introduces a style that will be used for the rest of the 80s by other big name bands. 5/5<BR>8. Rime of the Ancient Mariner - The closer is a true masterpiece, although the middle gets a little slow, the wait is more than worth it. 5/5<br />All in all this has become one of my favorite albums of all time, right up there with Master Of Puppets (Metallica), ...And Justice For All (Metallica), Paranoid (Black Sabbath), Cowboys From Hell (Pantera), Vulgar Display Of Power (Pantera), and Colony (In Flames).  Go out and buy this album, it's worth your $.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is excellent. Finding a better album is rare; this album is an excellent buy. Coldplay has a really unique, cutting-edge style and it is very cool. I'm a 16 year old guy in california, I love this CD, my parents and little sister love it, my relatives in New York love it, my good friend in Washington can't get enough of it. This is just an amazing CD for anyone. After i bought it- I became a die hard Coldplay fan. YES it's that good!
0446677450|3.0|A &quot;so-so&quot; book - good title and intro, but I learned more from the &quot;Wealthy Barber&quot; book.
B000002LMM|5.0|Melancholy and dark at times, this chiefly instrumental/jazz soundtrack is hard to forget, especially with such a great theme song and titles like &quot;Laura Palmer's Theme,&quot; &quot;Audrey's Dance,&quot; and &quot;The Bookhouse Boys,&quot; which make it easier to recall certain episodes and scenes. I did notice, however, that there are a few songs missing that played during the series, like the James, Donna, and Madeleine song (not that I'm heartbroken that it didn't appear on here ;) and a couple other Julee Cruise tunes that were played at the Roadhouse. And speaking of Cruise, lyrics are included for the three songs she sings: &quot;The Nightingale,&quot; &quot;Into the Night,&quot; and &quot;Falling&quot;--all written by David Lynch. Another nice addition to the booklet is the 40 small color photos of the more important characters in the series, even Diane--well, just a photo of Agent Cooper's hand holding his mini tape recorder.<br />This is an excellent soundtrack to a rather quirky TV drama. Fans of this series will certainly want to add this CD to their collection. Also recommended: the &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me&quot; movie soundtrack, which is another great collaboration by David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti.
B00007FOMP|5.0|An utterly classic, highly-recommended album, but if you have the previously-released remastered version you don't need this. The two bonus tracks are single edits of two album tracks - hardly worth an upgrade. If you have the two-CD special edition, you've got it all.
1573229725|5.0|Two words pretty much sum up Fingersmith by Sarah Waters: Absolutely Amazing!  From the minute I picked this book up and began reading, I just could not put it down.  It's quick, exciting pace makes it almost effortless to read and its frequent plot twists left me completely surprised and very eager to read on.  Never have I read historical fiction that has been so enthralling.  I loved Sarah Water's previous tour de forces, and she has done it once again.  She is truly an amazing author, and I am very excited to see what magical tale she will spin for us next!
0316666343|5.0|I found The Lovely Bones to be a welcome break from the usual \\"murder mystery\\" point of view.  In this book, there is no question of the identity of the killer, and the observations of the victim who has passed on (well, almost) are quite unique.  Some readers were disturbed at the victim's description of heaven, but I found it comforting, and enjoyable.  I highly recommend the book, and I read it in almost one sitting.  Kudos to Alice Sebold!
0553565915|1.0|I found the story quite enteresting, however, it goes against allot of the things I have been taught and or read in my Bible.  I find it very difficult to believe the entire story although it has some very good points. It is always good to have more love and respect for others in this world.  I agree that we are here for a reason we have something to learn and something to teach. Her story is very positive and it may very well be true, I just find it difficult to believe in it's entirety. I wish her lots of love and luck in all her writings, and hopefully if she is telling the absolute truth, we will all know someday and in which case I am sorry I doubted her.
B00000K0E5|5.0|We finnaly have Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. Tim Dalton was great, he just lacked in the charm department. I had my douts on this movie before I watched this movie about how pierce would fit into the roll. Afterwords...There is nobody that portrayes Bond like Pierce Brosnan. He is a combination of all of the previous bonds put together...Connery's Smoothness...Moore's funny charm... And Daltons brute force assassin all rolled up to make A truley blended bond. Goldeneye is up there in the greatest bond movies ever made. Awsome story, guns, explosives, and WOMEN...O YA! Brosnan has his best bond to date in this film, tommaro never dies in a close 2nd, then the world is not enough, then the mistake of Die Another Day . What really sets this movie apart is the main willin is not a meglomaniac who wants to take over the world, but rather bonds former friend and double O agent.  The fights and insults they throw at each other are great. If you have a dvd player and like action and are a bond fan...or even if u are not...A MUST OWN MOVIE FOR ANYBODY!
B00003CXS4|4.0|I don't know what mike whatever is name is on about this is a great movie (also as it was realeased about two years before the remake of oceans 11[which also rocked by the way!] its unlikly the director was trying to remake it) <br />The movie is great fun from how to feed a body to a pig to the superlative brad pitt as a incomprehensible gypsie (or pikey)<br />If you havent seen this movie BUY IT NOW!
6302402824|5.0|I thought this video was great.  My favorite clip was Sharp Dressed Man because of the music and the beat.  My second favorite was Gimme All Your Lovin.  My third favorite was Burger Man.<br />ZZ kicks A-S-S on this album!
B00005N83M|4.0|...But this CD is really good! I waited to get it when they rereleased it with the I'm Real remix, which is really good. Sure her looks aren't really suited to this song, but it's still really good. It doesn't even sound like the original I'm Real. My favorite songs are \\"Play\\" \\"I'm Real\\" (original and remix) and \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\". Those are all really good. The rest of the songs are pretty good. J Lo's... woops, I mean \\"Jenny\\" recently put out a really really bad new CD \\"This Is Me...Then\\". Well, this Jennifer Lopez is a whole lot better. I reccomend this CD to everyone. It's really good. Don't be fooled by her new CD, this CD is so much better. Enjoy!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is a good mood setting music.  It's very soft, slow, sexy and seductive.  The song \\"Don't Know Why\\" that's played on the radio so much is not even the best song on this album.  There's an interesting jazzy rendition of Hank William's \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" that I absolutely love.  The song, \\"Turn Me On\\" is a great slow dance song.  So is \\"Nearness of You.\\"  Nora's voice is romantic and soothing.  This is a wonderful album for lovers.  Put the kids to bed, pour a couple glasses of wine, turn down the lights and slow dance in front of the fireplace.
B00005JL96|5.0|The kids really enjoy this movie.  They watch it at least twice a day.
B00005JLKN|5.0|\\"Red Dragon\\" is a tight thrilling film, and a much better adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel than the first try, \\"Manhunter\\" which was just plain boring. \\"Red Dragon\\" will leave you gasping for air with fright, even if you know the novel by heart, and, if your um tastes run akin to mine, Anthony Hopkins will leave you breathless with longing. He is wonderful for an amazing thrid time as Hannibal Lecter. The added Lecter scenes are beautifully done, and so flawless I nearly believed them to be part of the original story. Hopkins is absolutely brilliant.  Yum.
B00006JKOM|4.0|This album took a while to grow on me but eventually it became a necessity in my Jethro Tull collection.  A continued testament to the greatest Tull lineup including: Barrie Barlow-drums, John Glascock-bass, John Evan-piano, and David Palmer. Of course Martin Barre's guitar is a given.  Favorite tracks are: Big Dipper, Taxi Grab, Crazed Institution, and Salamander.  Not quite as good a album as-Warchild,Stormwatch, Heavy Horses, and Songs From the Wood. Still a great album with lots of musical variety.  Highly recommended. This Tull lineup is second to only the Stones.
B00006RAKP|5.0|First of all, how could Elton have left off Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds? It was a number one song, for [goodnes] sakes, and I believe this is a greatest \\"hits\\" collection... <br />Alright, the reason Funeral For A Friend, etc. was left off is that it wasn't a Hot 100 chart hit. It's that simple. These are the hit singles, meaning the songs were released as singles, not album cuts. Which brings me to the next CD that should be released (which I'm sure would sell just fine) -- a CD focusing on the album cuts and perhaps, other assorted singles that were left off of this CD.<br />Half of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (Elton's masterpiece) could be on this CD, but just to name a few, we could have Funeral/Love Lies Bleeding (Elton's masterpiece that Beethoven surely would have attempted if he were alive in the 1970's), Grey Seal & This Song Has No Title (or \\"Tittle\\") and of course Harmony (can you believe it wasn't released as a single?  That's how deep GBYR was.  I read somewhere that if GBYR was released today, they'd be milking singles off of it for like six years before Elton released another album.  Yet it's nowhere near as bad as Paul McCartney not releasing Maybe I'm Amazed as a single in 1970/71)... Other cuts could include Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (fabulous song, basically ignored by Elton in live shows), Pinball Wizard (another [great] song that is among his best and rivals the original version), Border Song, Take Me to the Pilot, Burn Down the Mission, Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters, Simple Life (and all those other post-70's tunes people have been mentioning, especially Empty Garden and Mama Can't Buy You Love (top ten \\"hit\\" and technically a 70's hit), Country Comfort, Grow Some Funk of Your Own, you can keep adding your favorites. The point is that it would sell, so why not do it?<br />Maybe then they would add Lucy, the dumbest, most offending omission to true Elton fans.<br />I almost forgot -- Skyline Pigeon -- this was one of Elton's first songs, and is quite possibly his best song (alright, it's at least possibly my favorite). It captures the essence of the Taupin/John songwriting partnership -- a glimpse of salvation; a dream of going to a better world/place; the ability to imagine that which is not but which could be (just look at the cover of GBYR, although Elton is leaving it, not entering it) -- in both words and brilliant, amazingly beautiful melodies.<br />P.S. How about The Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes?  I thought that was the best song, by far, on Songs From the West Coast.  Yeah, just my opinion, but that song rivals his 70's hits, which I can't say for the rest of the album, even though it's still a good piece of work.
B00006JKON|5.0|This album is great and along with Stormwatch ,Heavy Horses and Benefit the best work from Jethro Tull.  The classic lineup of musicians include; Barrie Barlow-drums, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond-bass, John Evan-piano, David Palmer-keyboards and conductor, and the familar Martin Barre on guitar.  Favorite gems are this album are:Queen and Country, Ladies, Back-Door Angels, Skating Away..., Bungle In The Jungle, and Third Hoorah.  A breif look at this faze of Tull history with the single song format contrasting Thick As A Brick and Passon Play efforts.  But if this is not enough the remaster gives us the previously unreleased Warchild Waltz along with other songs we've heard from the Nightcap compilation and Saturation from the 3 cd 20 yrs box set.  Also the superb Rainbow Blues and Glory Row.  Ian Anderson's 2002 liner notes sum it up best:&quot;The inclusion in this re-mastered edition of some extra tracks recorded at the same time but left off the original release due to time constraits (ever the problem with vinyl) will please some and irrate others but it is time they joined their brothers and sisters after so many years.&quot;  Its great to finally have these extra tracks from the same sessions together in context to enjoy.  Arguably the best Tull effort.
B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath was by far the darkest, most controversial, and most metallic band of their time. With Iommi's sludgy riffs, Ozzy's dark vocals, and lyrics about the evils of war, nuclear devastation, and drugs, Black Sabbath made critics of its time scratch their heads and say, \\"What is THIS stuff?!?\\"<br /><br />The answer: Revolutionary. Black Sabbath was the original heavy metal band, and to this day few other bands are able to craft anything like the dark and oppressive mood of this album--Black Sabbath's second release.<br /><br />There is no filler here. Every song is strong, from the antiwar pounder War Pigs/Luke's Wall, the uptempo rocker Paranoid, the eerily spacey Planet Caravan, the world-famous chords of Iron Man, the bucket of sludge that is Electric Funeral, the scary depictions of heroin and Vietnam in Hand Of Doom, and the  final acid-inspired freakout of Jack The Ripper/Fairies Wear Boots are all classic tracks, with only Rat Salad (a Bill Ward drum solo) not up to par but certainly not unlistenable by any means. I personally rate Paranoid as Sabbath's best effort, with Master Of Reality a close second.<br /><br />If you're a fan of classic rock or heavy metal, your collection is not complete without this timeless release. Period.
B00003CXB7|1.0|One of the worst movies of all time.
B00006V9A0|2.0|This album really is a shame really. Nirvana seem to have become just a \\"hits\\" band thanks to this collection. What's with all the new Kurt stuff lately? This album, Journals? Anyways, This is a disappointment for the fact that Nirvana never was the kind of band, in my humble opinion to have a hits collection. Kurt was all against that kind of thing and I always believed that Nirvana was severely overrated. The grunge thing killed them. They were more noise-metal-punk-catchy...you can't really catogorize them. If you want a talented Seattle band, I think you should stick to Alice In Chains. The new song \\"You Know You're Right\\" doesn't do a thing for me and I don't even know why it was released. It should have been kept as a b-side where songs like Curmudgeon and Moist Vagina belong. [Weak] songs. This album has songs from their previous releases...bla bla. Unfortunetly it has [weak songs] like Teen Spirit which was just a big joke..god what a [weak] song. I do appreciate the fact they got some In Utero songs but I just think they should leave the Nirvana vaults alone and just move on with life. It's amazing how when someone dies they automatically become some kind of hero or celebrity. OVERRATED!!
0783204914|5.0|Don't take my word for it, because this is one of my favorite movies. I will admit, it's a long story. However, if you have the patience to sit and watch, it's a good one! Pacino is at his best and the plot is warm hearted and wonderful. Of course, the tango scene is not to me missed. They don't make movies as good as this all the time, so take your time and enjoy it.
B00005JL2O|3.0|This movie ok, it wasn't horrible, but it could have been alot better. I'm not to certain to give it 2 stars or 3, so I really would give it 2.5. The rating chart doesn't give that so I just rounded up to 3 stars. I found this movie just ok. The jokes were the same alot from the second and third to this one. The only real good new joke was the \\"fook me, fook yu\\" joke.<BR>    The movie is all about Dr. Evil and Mini-me want to flood the world, (their in a submarine), with the help of Goldmember. They get caught by Austin, and go to Jail. Austin Powers gets knighted and his father wasn't there. Austin's Dad gets kidnapped by Goldmember in 1975. (Nigel Powers gets kidnapped after the knighting ceremony.) So Austin travels back in time to 1975 where he meets Foxxy Cleopatra to team-up with to get Austin's father and stop Goldmember. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil and Mini-me break out of jail. Can Austin and Foxxy stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember? (I'm leaving you in suspence, because I don't want to give the ending away.)<BR>      I give this movie extra points because of the special apperances.. such as.. Tom cruise, The Osbournes, Brittney Spears, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey, Katie Couric, John Travolta, and some more. acting wise Mike Myers isn't that great. I'd give him 1/3. But I do have to give him credit for being Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, Fat B. Beyonc Knowles  was ok, especially for her first film. I give her 2/3. and everyone else I would give 1/3.<BR>        The infinifilm extras was great! I loved the Deleted sceans and the bonus stuff. That deserves a few stars itself.<BR>       But all and all.. I would give this ok movie 2.5 (3) stars. Most jokes were the same but this one is more hip and hop than the others. I would put 1. Austin Powers: The spy who shagged me 2. Austin Powers In Goldmember 3. Austin Powers: International man of mystery. This one had more action and exciting things in it than the others. I give it 2.5 (3)stars.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's novel The Lovely Bones opens simply: \\"I was fourteen when I was murdered December 6, 1973.\\" This ethereal story examines death's impact from an unconventional point of view; Suzie Salmon, the rape and murder victim, narrates. Torn between moving forward or watching over her family and friends, Suzie rests in her personal heaven-the high school she never got to attend, where her \\"textbooks were Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue.\\"<br />While in heaven, Suzie \\"lives\\" vicariously through her younger sister, watches her parent's relationship crumble, guards over her childhood crush (\\"Our only kiss was like an accident-a beautiful gasoline rainbow\\"), peers into the life of the all-too human detective assigned to her case, and stalks her murderer.<br />This coming-of-age history is bittersweet until the very end, tracing the lives of those Suzie touched while examining death's effects. Unfortunately, Sebold muddies a strong first novel and leaves the reader with a too-tidy ending, mimicking her protagonist's heaven.
B000000OQF|5.0|Clearly one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever released. Appetite for Destruction brings its own style of blues and hard rock to the table. Each song has its own uniqe style and relates to a different listener. Axel Rose's genious lyrics and Slash's amazing guitar riffs mezmorize it's listeners and keep them beging for more. Over all my call would be to purchase the album even if your not a fan.<BR>Welcome to the Jungle-10/10<BR>It's So Easy-8/10<BR>Nightrain-8/10<BR>Out Ta Get Me-9/10<BR>Mr. Brownstone-9/10<BR>Paradise City-10/10<BR>My Michelle-7/10<BR>Think About You-8/10<BR>*Sweet Child of Mine-11/10<BR>This song gets my star of approvial. Amazing riffs,great lyrics, and hard rocking make this song the greatest.<BR>You're Crazy-7/10<BR>Anything Goes-8/10<BR>Roket Queen-10/10
0316666343|4.0|This unique story captivates you from the first page.  I thought it would be a disgusting book at first, since it's about a little girl who gets murdered, but it's SO MUCH more than that!!  The little girl gives you such an interesting vantage point from heaven.  You learn to love and relate to her and the family and friends she left behind and what happens to them.  It's an incredible story and it gave me such a remarkable feeling of peace after I read it.
B000066744|5.0|I shouldn't be surprised when I checked, without naming names, several reknown film critics had given it bad reviews. I mean, REALLY bad reviews,because the way those guys do their jobs--making notes while watching films.  Poor fellows, they can't watch anything without dissecting them into body parts, and the so-called film reviews end up being film-making-techniques-reviews.<br />Upon saying so, the film was beautifully made, and impeccably acted, raw and refined at the same time.  It is one of those films you would get more and more by each viewing because their story and characters are so complex in their simplicity, and so simple in their complexity. I think it's better explained in music than words--let's just put it this way. If you had seen the film, you'd know what I meant.
0743424425|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Stephen King.  The plot and the characters were out of this world.  The book is real, not some of those fake plots you have in some novels.  Jack, Wendy, and their five-year old son Danny, go up to the Colorado mountains and stay at an old hotel with a lot of unspoken history behind it.  Jack is the caretaker, which means only they are going to be the ones in the hotel for the entire snowed-in winter.  The hotel is the Overlook.  All Jack knows is that a man named Grady went insane and killed his family and then himself.  Jack soon finds out some more interesting things about the hotel as they stay longer.  Danny is gifted with the Shining, he goes into death-like trances when in thought or in dreams.  Danny knows something about the hotel, and, at first his parents don't believe him, but soon, Wendy understands.  Danny and Wendy know that they have to leave the hotel, but they don't know how to get Jack out since it is his job as caretaker.  The novel will chill you right down the the center of your bones, don't miss it!!!

BUT YOU NEVER GET TIRED OF HEARING THEIR SINGLES FOR INSTANT ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID HAS AN AWESOME VOCAL RECORDING AND NOT GONNA GET US HAS THAT COOL AND UP BEAT RYTHYM IF YOURE TIRED OF AVRIL AND CHRISTINA AND WANT TO HEAR REAL MUSIC BUY THEIR ALBUM!!!!!!!!
B00006M183|1.0|What the hell happened?  This album is awful!  How could a band who made songs like &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Evenflow&quot;, and &quot;Betterman&quot; make something this bad?  I've been a Pearl Jam fan since Ten, and although the sound has changed since then I always liked what I heard.  However I couldn't like this album even if I tried, there wasn't even one good song!  It's as if Pearl Jam want to be to grunge what Michael Jackson is to pop.  Very sad.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Very funny spoof of the movies &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer.&quot;  The dvd includes lots of hilarious scenes that were edited out of the movie. (Those scenes are definately R rated but very funny.)
B00005OM4N|2.0|I actually Got Britney  free through an offer. I only gave it 2 stars because there is a few songs because there is some good songs. I'm Not yet,a woman is good.

If you are offered this cd free only take it for the few good songs.
0385720920|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  But it made me feel sick.  It says right in the first chapter that you shouldn't read this.  And he's right.  I can't in good conscience reccomend this book to anyone.  But if you do read it, you'll probably agree.

B000001FSU|5.0|For some reason the guitar tones here just didn't sound right to me. But I saw the one beuty part of it: an effort following up Among The Living. This one has more of a dramatic content which you can see especialy on Be All, End All.<BR>No more Judge Dread here.....
B00006J3T4|5.0|This is a lovely album. I have heard it about six or seven times and there isn't a single awkward song here. It is a smooth and pleasant listening experience from beginning to end. This is in contrast to Knopfler's two earlier solo efforts (Golden heart and Sailing to philadelphia) where one is forced to skip a song here or there. There is also a remarkable improvement in his singing. I particularly liked the songs 'Quality Shoe', 'Fare thee well northumberland' and the closing 'Old Pigweed' - great lyrics, fine music and perfect tone.<BR> <BR> People who complain about missing lead guitar licks from Knopfler's Dire Straits days should note the crisp  acoustic/rhythm/bass guitar work in every song. In fact, in terms of diversity in style and giving each song its own slightly unique flavour, I'd say he has definitely improved over the years. The only problem I have is that he has eased up on structural innovation - both in terms of the musical construction of the song and the rhyming patterns in the lyrics. It would be great to see a few unpredictable songs like 'telegraph road' again.
1565847032|5.0|Noam Chomsky is a professor of linguistics at MIT and, over his lifetime, has become increasingly outspoken in left-wing views about American foreign policy.  This book is a compilation of transcripts of his question/answer discussions on college campuses and lecture halls between the years 1989 and 1999.  The focus is on the politics of power in general, and the United States Government and the media in particular.  His words are low-key and conversational and yet they carry a sharp sting as he reinterprets events over the past 35 years. In addition to the 401-pages of the book, there are 500 more pages of footnotes on the Internet.<br />I found the book fascinating reading.  My eyes stayed glued to the page and I found myself stopping often to think about his seemingly simple statements.  I learned a lot.  And some of it was hard to take because it made me look critically at my own view of the world and broke up many of my preconceived ideas.  If anything, he demonstrates that there are many sides to every question.  And I had never taken a careful look at his side before.<br />Most of it was easy to follow.  However, a lot had to do with economics, which I always find confusing.  I therefore have no idea whether his arguments on this topic are valid or not.  But when it comes to human nature, I'm an expert.  I understand the greed, the desire for power and the horrendous amount of death and destruction that has always existed.  I also understand the need to try to fight oppressive forces and make the world a better place to live.  This is what Professor Chomsky wants to happen.  He gives examples of progress we've made in the past that might have seemed impossible at another time.  For example, in 1790, it didn't seem that slavery would ever end.  And we've come a long way in the United States in the elimination of segregation and the advance of women's rights.  Environmental issues are also beginning to be addressed.  This gives Professor Chomsky's audiences hope.<br />But most of the book turned a flashlight on the horrors in the world.  And it bothers me that he blames it all on the United States.  Surely, the world's ills existed long before the Declaration of Independence was even formulated.  The American government, itself, is based on positive ideals.  Yes, we have been responsible for many misdeeds.  But where, but in America, would Professor Chomsky be able to be so outspoken in his criticism?  In some places of the world, he would be met with a firing squad instead of an audience who cherish his every word.<br />The book raised a lot of questions for me.  And, after careful reflection I can only say that I partially agree with some of his conclusions.  Some don't quite ring true.  And others just seem wrong.  The problem is that he seems to believe his conclusions first and then finds the facts to support his beliefs.  As I could never have the battery of facts at my fingertips to debate him, or the personality for debate, I cannot make any statements of the \\"truths\\" of his convictions.  That doesn't mean, however, that he didn't open my mind to new possibilities.<br />This book is certainly worth reading and I highly recommend it.  It engaged my mind and stimulated my thinking.  I don't believe there are easy answers and, in fact, neither does Professor Chomsky.  As a matter of fact he purposely refuses to give any concrete proposals for rectifying the situations he discusses.  Basically, he's just opening our minds.  And perhaps that is enough.e.<br />But most of the book turned a flashlight on the horrors in the world.  And it bothers me that he blames it all on the United States.

B000002KBH|3.0|The Dead's roots were in jug band and hillbilly music, and this album brings them back home.  I'm grateful that the Dead (pun fully intended) introduced so many people to America's musical heritage (myself included, 30 years ago), but this is not a great album, especially when compared to the music that inspired it.  They hit some nice woody grooves, and there is a pleasant sense of old friends pickin' and singin' on the back porch. Unfortunately the performances are generally thin and ragged, and, though they clearly are trying, they never find that deep vein of American collective unconscious that some of their contemporaries like Dylan and the Band manage to drill into so effectively.  If you like this record, check out the real thing - the Carter Family, the Mississippi Sheiks, Dock Boggs, the Skillet Lickers, Doc Watson and Merle Haggard.
B00005NVT1|4.0|This is a live recording from 1997, when HOMEWORK was released, this was a concert to promote it. First thing you should know, there is no tracklisting to this cd, it is just one track of all the songs on HOMEWORK remixed together. It runs for approx. 45 minutes. You might be thinking that 45 minutes is long to listen to, but it's never quite boring. Fans of Daft Punk will love it, hearing the originals is one thing, but when you listen to this CD you get a sense of being there in the crowd, as there is a lot of audience participation. At times it seems to slow down but it's always building up to a crescendo of funk that will make you want to dance and go crazy. Overall its a nice CD for hardcore Daft Punk fans, but not necessarily essential to own for casual listeners or fans.
0312305060|3.0|This is one of those cases where, had I read the book first, I probably would have been in awe of the richness and touching insights in this story. I saw the movie first and loved it so much that I had to read the book that started it all and I was probably wanting the story to move at a different, more visual pace. <BR>The story is amazing and this writer  definately has an incredibly original mind.  My only complaint is that it dwells a lot on lingering descriptions while I am just dying for the story to move on.  Once it does, it's heavenly.  The flow of the story is just sometimes stalled with details.<BR>For instance, in one scene, an assistant brings in a cup of coffee and we have to hear about her story and what she appears to be but what she really is and I just want to hear the conversation of the main characters that is going to take place.<BR>Still, of course, it is a wonderful book and will leave you touched.
B000002HRE|1.0|There is not much good to be said about this album.  It contains two good songs, and one (Fixxxer) of them follows the same formula as their best songs (Bleeding Me & Outlaw Torn) on \\"Load.\\"  The other good song is \\"Carpe Diem Baby.\\"  These are the only two songs that fans of the Metallica that died along with Cliff Burton will like.  Really, this album should have just been a double sided single.  The rest of the album out and out sucks.  Yeah, \\"Fuel\\" is a fast song that sounds great when you're watching the NASCAR race on a Sunday, but that 20 seconds that they play of it is really all you can take of it.  \\"Memory Remains\\" is just a god awful song.  Marianne Faithful or whoever that old crone is at the end garbling along is just further proof of Metallica's \\"anything we do is good enough for you\\" attitude at this point.  Go buy Testament's \\"The Gathering\\" \\"Low\\" or \\"The Ritual\\" instead.  You'll find great music from a Bay Area band that didn't lose it's bite,....  They're the albums Metallica wish they could make.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|They're back in black...and that's really all there is to this film.  It's a basic story that reunites Agent K with J to kill more aliens.<br />The film is not completely without merit.  There are some good jokes and humorous scenes involved.  There is also a better array of special effects.  But at the same time, the goofiness and in-your-face style of the film takes on a more unbelievable edge.<br />The characters are still well-developed and well enacted.  But the story is rather dull and offers little to the imagination (except for the ending locker sequence, but even that scene is bizzare and unbelievable).<br />I consider the first Men In Black to be much better.  I found the sequel to be dull.
B000051S44|5.0|Would like to see it on DVD with all the extra footage.  Would pay extra for this DVD anytime.  A real classic
B0000640SB|4.0|The classic government conspiracy surrounding the UFO and alien phenomenon comes out at last with explosive and literally gooey force.  It's a film that takes almost every aspect of the government conspiracy theory (the black-suited men, the aliens, the spaceships, and power-freak teachers) and puts it in a funny and exciting reference.<br />The film's story line is relatively simple and small-scale, but still leaves much room for thrills, suspense, humor, and imagination.  At the same time, it allows characters sufficient room to develop.  The actors of the film did a swell job in this film, and are topped only by the film's special effects.<br />Combined with a great theme song and musical score, this film is most enjoyable.  The special features in this disc set makes the movie even more worth it.  It's a deluxe deal!
6302891272|4.0|This was a very interesting way of representing Shakespeare's Macbeth.<BR>Before I saw it I was skeptical that Shakespeare in any other language than English would be lacking. <BR>I think that Kurosawa makes up for the lack of rich Shakespearean language with all kinds of interesting cinematic touches, such as the eerie white makeup he uses for the witch(es) and ghost(s). I also liked the camera angles used, even though many of the cuts were held too long. <BR>Even though the overall plot was similar to Shakespeare's Macbeth there were one or two things that I feel made it a completely different story. Macbeth's motivation to kill the king was very different in Kurosawa's version. I think the fact that Washizu (Macbeth) tells his army about the witch(es) radically changes the overall ending.
B000002IMG|5.0|The debate over what is the best Testament album is always an interesting one, because, even though the music isn't so different on each albums, they all have their own unique theme. The Legacy is in your face 80's thrash, Practice What You Preach and Souls of Black have their thrash meets melody elements, The Ritual has it's mainstream metal, Demonic has it's Death Metal elements, and Gathering , like Legacy , in your face thrash, but updated. <br />Even though all their albums are good, I'd definitely say \\" The New Order\\" (released in 1988 and their second album) is the best. As far as thrash goes, it definitely is up there with albums like \\" Master of Puppets\\" ( Metallica) , \\"Reign in Blood\\" ( Slayer), and \\" Rust in Peace\\" ( Megadeth). While Testament isn't as big as those bands ( from a genre point of view), The New Order is great. The album is so melodic yet so heavy/fast at the same time. <br />I have never listened to an album with so many songs that are easily concert set list worthy. There's \\" Eerie Inhabitants\\", \\" The New Order\\", \\" Trial B y Fire\\" , \\" Into the Pit\\", \\"Disciples of the Watch ( quite possibly the Testament classic), and \\" The Preacher\\", which are all very important songs in Testament's history . \\" Hypnosis\\" and \\" Musical Death ( A Dirge)\\" are both great instrumentals.  \\" Nobody's Fault\\" , which is an Aerosmith cover tune, is greatly translated from Classic Rock to Metal. \\" A Day of Reckoning\\" to me is the only average song on he album. I love all the melodic intros and inspirational lyrics.<br />I highly recommend this album , and I say if you only had to buy one Testament album ( Although The Legacy and Souls of Black are great too) , get this one.
B000065U6O|5.0|Triumph Des Willens opens with Wagnerian fanfare and a series of introductory captions, identifying it as \\"the historical document of the 1934 Congress of the National Socialist German Worker's Party.\\"  The Congress was held 4-10 September 1934.  Other captions remind the viewer that it was \\"20 years after the Outbreak of the World War\\", \\"16 years after the beginning of Germany's suffering\\", and \\"19 months after the beginning of the German Rebirth\\"<br />It's interesting to note the skill with which Leni Riefenstahl constructed the 1934 Party Congress as a nationalistic, moral-booster to inspire the Germans that their time of destiny has come.  However, it's also an exercise on picking up hints of Hitler's plans.  Hitler says that the racially best of Germany are the carriers of the best blood.  At the Night Rally, he declares that \\"The State does not order us.  We order the state\\" and \\"The State did not create us.  We created the State.\\"  The second is true, but as for the first, hmmm....  Rabid anti-Semite Julius Streicher's assertions that people who don't protect their racial purity go to seed is the most overt.<br />Hitler's skills as an orator are demonstrated throughout, especially his address to the Hitlerjugende (Hitler Youth) and the closing speech.  In the key line in the first address<br />where he tells the youth to be peace-loving, but strong and courageous, and to learn self-sacrifice and never to collapse, he's basically telling them, \\"I'm sending you out to war to be killed.\\"  Cunning of the man!  And in the closing speech, he is glowing with excitement and triumph.<br />The labour force's equating spades and tools as their weapons in their quest to rebuild Germany is a repeat of the societal militarization during Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm II's time.  A slam at Versailles comes where the youths announce where they came from--Silesia, Bavaria, Dresden, etc.  The last two names mentioned:  the Rhine and the Saar.<br />Other references are alluded to in his speech to the SA and SS.  The dark shadow that crossed the SA months ago is a reference to the Night of the Long Knives, as is the presence of Victor Lutze, successor to Ernst Rohm, a prime target in the Long Knives.  Lutze and the SA and SS pledge to be faithful to Hitler also establishes Hitler's sole control of the SS, and under him, Himmler.<br />The lion's share of the film, weighted towards the film's latter moments, is devoted to the Grand Review of armed forces in Adolf Hitler Platze, where units of the SA, air force, and SS march, the latter the crowning finale, all marching in formation.  The leaders of each division, such as Lutze, Goering, and Himmler all salute Hitler, stand by him, and watch the processions.  This show of force is clearly a grand telling off of the Versailles Treaty.<br />Riefenstahl's cinematography also plays a massive role in this film.  Indeed, certain scenes are best seen on the big screen, such as Albert Speer's Sea of Flags and Cathedral of Light on Zeppelin Field, panoramic shots, such as Hitler, Himmler, and Lutze marching the long distance to pay tribute to the fallen with columns of SA standing at attention on either side, and the closing moments of the Congress.  Aerial shots include the shadow of Hitler's plane flying over Nuremberg and the view of the Hitler Youth tents and barracks.<br />As for the new subtitles and translations, there are subtle changes compared to the copy I had before.  The most notable one comes in the intro, where instead of \\"16 years after the crucifixion of Germany\\", the caption now reads \\"16 years after the beginning of Germany's suffering\\".  The brief captions identifying key Nazi personnel help out tremendously.<br />No, Leni Riefenstahl shouldn't be condemned as a collaborator of the Nazi Party?  This documentary if anything set the standard for long shots, the power effect transcended by mass crowd, and the choking close-ups of a symbol, that of the swastika, and as a piece of art transforming speeches and marches into a political extravaganza, is a masterpiece.forming speeches and marches into a political extravaganza, is a masterpiece.
067101756X|5.0|My interest in reading this book had little or nothing to do with UFOs or ETs (EBEs as Col. Corso calls them. I served a 2 year stint in the Army Medical Corps as a physcian at White Sands Proving Ground from 1955 to 1957. I visited Roswell a few times there.The rumors of UFOs having landed there were looked upon as far as I was concerned at the time.I did develop an intense interest in rocketry and space exploration as a result of my activities at White Sands.To this day, I am convinced that Space IS truly the new frontier of humanity. Col. Corso's well written book only further convinces me of this conviction.     I read this book as a \\"textbook\\". It certainly is credible. Even if is simply and extension of the governments \\"cover-up\\" to further confuse the public or our earthly enemies, this book gives food for thought. We would be foolish to cast it aside as an udated \\"Buck Rogers fairy tale\\".There are too many \\"coincidences\\" noted in this book that link \\"fantasy\\" with modern hi-tech reality in the world today, to debunk what the book portrays. Electromagnetic energy is ubiquitous throughout socity today not only in our homes and industry, but especially in the healthcare professions as well. It will someday (soon I hope!) replace our dependence upon fossil fuels in the transportation industry. Whether this \\"new\\" energy source emantes from \\"EBE\\" technology is not for me to debate, but I certainly to do not discount its veracity as a possibility.<BR>     Space travel not only will open up vast new frontiers, it could shed new insight into matters of spirituality and where we \\"humanoids\\" fit in the universe. I found this  book very intriguing even if it could have been a huge figment of Col. Corso's vivid imagination.
B000001EC1|5.0|Never heard of Bon Jovi?  Where have you been hiding.  Bon Jovi is one of the few \\"hair metal\\" band still around, and doing a good job of it.   Cross rooads tries to do a best of from their first few cds, Bon Jovi( 2 stars), 7800 degress Farh.(3), Slippery when Wet( 4 1/2), Bad Medicine(4), Keep the Faith(3 1/2), and Jon's first solo cd, the Young Guns 2 Soundtrack, Blaze of Glory(3).  Most of the big hits are on this disk, really 2 disks were needed, but then there would have been some filler in the disk, or more new songs.   Speaking of New songs, of the three on this disk, only Always feels like it belongs, this is clearly a great song.  Someday...and Prayer 94, could have been left off in favor of a couple more of their hits.<BR>     But if you never have heard of Bon jovi, Start here.  You will be hooked.   And maybe, one day, we will get a boxed set from this group.
B000075BFK|4.0|Ok i didn't buy the cd but I did download most of the songs off the net (not all, just some).  I listened to them and found out that they added in new beats and that was a good improvement.  Like i listened to the old thugz mansion version and it was totally different than the cd one.  The lyrics were still the same (cept nas was on one of them) but the beats were changed.  With the old version, it seemed the song was serious and dark but when they put in the guitar, which was nice, but completely changed the attitude of the song to happy or something.  Anyways, I like the new beats than the old ones.  The old ones seem so muffled and out of style.  The new ones are clear crisp and in style.  Like take My block for instance.  The guitar is pretty nice than the keyboard or something.
B00005YW4H|4.0|As someone who listens mostly to the music of men who died before he was born, the appearance of Norah Jones - pop icon, legitimate jazz artist, and only a few years older than me - is cause for celebration. Jones, with her sultry voice and almost-gorgeous features, brings a spirit of youth and sex appeal to the long-suffering jazz genre just as she brings refreshing musicianship to popular music.   <br />Jones's debut album is a collection of originals written by her and her sidemen and a few covers. Some are catchy (\\"Don't Know Why\\", written by guitarist Jesse Harris), some are fun (\\"Feelin' the Same Way\\", by bassist Lee Alexander), and some are plain beautiful (\\"The Long Day is Over\\", by Harris and Jones). All are greatly enhanced by the outstanding session men, Brian Blade, Adam Levy, and Kevin Breit. Jazz legend Bill Frisell unfortunately appears on only one track, but his inimitable playing helps make \\"The Long Day is Over\\" the high point of the album. Jones's voice is tremendous throughout, and her piano work is simple but elegant.<br />Some of the criticisms that have been leveled at this album are unfair. The songs are not all of the same tempo; Though it is true that the songs on this album are mostly of a moderate pace, Jones does well with the more uptempo numbers (eg \\"Feelin' the Same Way\\") and the slower ones (\\"Come Away with Me\\"). She also does very well with songs that are in unusual time signatures, like \\"The Long Day is Over\\" (6/8) and \\"The Nearness of You\\" (12/8). One reviewer mentioned that the song \\"Turn Me On\\" sounds a lot like a Leonard Cohen song (\\"Bird on a Wire\\"). I agree; but as \\"Turn Me On\\" is a cover, this is does not show Jones to be derivative.<br />My only real complaint is that the middle third of this album just isn't as strong as the rest of it. \\"Come Away with Me\\" and \\"Shoot the Moon\\" aren't the strongest songs on the album, and \\"Turn Me On\\" pales in comparison to \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" and \\"The Nearness of You\\". Additionally, the lyrics are weak in places.<br />Be that as it may, this album is a breath of fresh air in the stale music industry. At its best moments, this album is as beautiful as anything that has been released in years. Norah Jones is going nowhere but up, which is a very good thing.
6304696566|3.0|I was very anxious to watch this movie, because of its fine reputation.  However, I was to be very dissapointed upon finishing viewing the movie.  Uneven acting performances, some pretty bad dialogue, and a story that I just couldn't quite buy.  As a result, I didn't really care about any of the characters.  The portrayal of Native Americans just does not ring true, revisionist history or not.  Some say that this movie has a positive message of anti-racism and anti-bigotry, but the movie's depiction of Native Americans suggest otherwise to me.<br />I'm not a big fan of John Wayne at all, as I think he is a one-dimensional actor.  But he plays a much more interesting character in another of John Ford's movie, which I think is much better than &quot;The Searchers&quot;.  The movie I'm talking about is not a western, but a war picture - &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;.
B000002U82|5.0|It is difficult to say which is the better of the two; 'Dark Side of the Moon' or 'Wish You Were Here', since they were released back to back in 1973 and 1975 respectively.<br />David Gilmour demonstrates with his lyricism and inventiveness why he might be the most underrated guitarist in the history of rock and roll music.
B00005KFUN|5.0|I discovered Muse by accident and continue to be surprised and thrilled by their talent.  While Radiohead may be the standard by which all new prog-rock bands are judged in this generation, Muse has a sound that cannot be so easily categorized-- a stupendous mix of astral, rock opera, acid jazz, surf rock, metal and experimental-- topped off by Bellamy's heart-wrenching falsetto which likens much more to Marc Bolan or Jeff Buckley than Thom Yorke.  Muse reminds me of an early, experimental Queen, armed with computers in the new age and full of ideas about what music SHOULD be.<br />While it is difficult to highlight any track on this album that outshines the others, 'Bliss', 'New Born' and 'Space Dementia' are a powerful trio proving that the art of orchestral rock lives on in this band.  The sultry blues of 'Feeling Good', the driving pop of 'Plug In Baby', the progressive Latin-fusion of 'Screenager' and the metal-meets-'60s-mods sound of 'Hyper Music' show that Muse have mastered every genre at their disposal (plus the kitchen sink) in a manner reminiscent of Jon Crosby of VAST.  Origin of Symmetry is Muse coming into their own, developing upon the impact they made with Showbiz, and casting aside any doubt that they are merely riding the coattails of the '90s art-school rock movement.<br />My only small gripe with Muse is that their lyrical abilities aren't quite up to par with their musical talent-- if their lyrics were a little more polished and profound and a little less teenaged-angsty, they'd without a doubt exceed the level of bands like Radiohead to whom they are so constantly compared (and I'm saying this as a huge Radiohead fan).  The other thing Muse needs to take care of is avoiding redundancy-- they have such a unique sound that is threatened by overuse, and my greatest hope for this band is that they continue to evolve or they will quickly become stagnant.<br />Take the time to get to know this band, and if you are anything like me (fearful for the future of genuinely great music) you will be delighted and constantly surprised by these young men.future of genuinely great music) you will be delighted and constantly surprised by these young men.
0312958455|5.0|I recommend reading Michael Connelly in the order the books were written.  I love most of them, and The Last Coyote is one of my favorites.<br />Although Harry Bosch has wrestled with his past before, it's in this book that Bosch confronts it.<br />This is an awesome read.  And the scene in Florida when Bosch meets McKittrick may be one of the best I've ever read in all of crime fiction.  It's that good.  The setup, the dialogue, everything.<br />I highly recommend this novel.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden were driving forces in 90's rock.  RATM, though not the first to mix rap and rock, were the first rap-rock band, and almost singlehandedly invented a new genre, which can now be regarded as \\"[bad] rock\\" (Limp Bizkit, Crazy Town, POD, etc).  Soundgarden were one of the many great Seattle grunge bands, and Chris Cornell is arguably the greatest vocalist of the genre (Layne Staley of Alice in Chains comes close as well).  With both bands now a memory that will no doubt live on, they have joined forces to create a supergroup that is nothing short of incredible.<br />Rumors had been circulating since right after Zack de la Rocha split from RATM that the remaining instrumentalists would team up with Chris Cornell.  No doubt the rock world was devastated when Cornell parted ways with them and they were forced to drop off of Ozzfest.  But once the single and video for \\"Cochise\\" hit the airwaves, it became apparent that peace was restored between the two parties, and that the rumors are now in fact a reality.<br />Inevitably, reaction to Audioslave's debut album is mixed, but for the most part, the reaction has been positive.  True, Zack de la Rocha's radical politics were one of the things that made RATM unique, but with any band, it is the music that matters most.  Without the music, their politics would not have gotten across, and with this, one realizes, that one listened to RATM, like with anything else, for the music more than anything else.  Chris Cornell is not political, but his lyrics are poetic, and his vocals are just as awesome as ever.<br />As a huge RATM fan who also enjoys Soundgarden, I was definitely exited for this album to be released, and found the first single \\"Cochise\\" to be awesome.  As the release date drew near, I started to have a feeling that the album was going to be bad.  Not that I thought it was going to, but I was AFRAID it was going to be bad.  Fortunately, as I had hoped, my fears diminished andI finished the album very impressed.<br />As expected, traces of both former bands are audible throughout.  \\"Hypnotize\\" recalls RATM's cover of \\"Renegades of Funk.\\"  \\"Cochise,\\" \\"Set It Off,\\" and \\"Gasoline\\" could very easily have been RATM songs, though Cornell's vocals fit it really well.<BR>  This makes one wonder what Cornell's voice might have sounded like over the classic \\"Killing In the Name\\" riff.  Lots of people have complained that the album does not have any new groundbreaking sounds, and that all it sounds like is RATM with Chris Cornell on vocals.  Personally, that is what I, like a lot of people, wanted, and Audioslave is exactly what it says it is, a two bands joining forces to form a new supergroup.<br />As stated before, there are plenty of songs here that could easily fit RATM songs with de la Rocha shouting his politics over them.  However, Chris Cornell fits these and all the other tracks extremely well.  When listening to this album and looking back on the RATM catalogue, one notices that nearly, if not all the songs in the RATM catalogue were heavy rockers.  Because Chris Cornell is a much more versatile vocalist then de la Rocha, the RATM boys are able to branch out and play more than just riff rockers.  \\"What You Are\\" is a pretty slow song with a heavy part.  \\"Like A Stone\\" is sheer musical genius, which contains what could very well be the best solo Tom Morello has ever laid down.  Others, like \\"Getaway Car\\" and \\"I Am the Highway\\" are sheer ballads, something they never could have done with de la Rocha.  Musically, everyone has improved greatly.  At times, the heavy numbers recall Led Zeppelin in their heyday.  With a vocalist as good and as diverse as Cornell, who can rock hard just as well as he can chill out, the boys are allowed to expand their styles of music, and their true talent as musicians shine through here.<br />Everyone on here plays phenomenally.  Chris Cornell sounds just as good as he did on Soundgarden's Superunknown album.Tom Morello's guitar playing is the best he's done since RATM's debut album back in 1992.  The rhythm section is also just as tight as ever.  With plenty of great songs and great musicians, Audioslave may very well be the best supergroup since Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young joined forces in 1969.  For any fan of good hard rock, this is highly recommended.  Those of us who grew up in the 90's will no doubt enjoy this record.  Audioslave has proven that there is in fact hope for rock music in the  future, and hopefully, Audioslave will be there to rock us out for a long time to come.<br />5/5

0316666343|5.0|This was a great book with a very interesting premise.  A pre-teen girl that is brutally murdered and has to deal with the effects on her family and herself.  It's has an interesting way of presenting heaven and how she helps her family and friends heal through out this terrible tragedy.  The author kept the violence to a minimum and focused on the family.  I think that anyone who has lost someone special would like this book and how it shows the victim's spirit alive within the family.
0800141660|5.0|This film is absolutely brilliant!  There is not much more to say!  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet give magnificent performances!  The storyline was written beautifully.  It is witty, endearing, sad and triumphant all at the same time throughout the entire movie!  You can't help but fall in love with all the heroic characters and come to despise the dishonest ones.  And the director, Ang Lee, did an amazing job of capturing the story through such a simple and understated way, yet it hardly comes across the film that way!  I recommend this film to anyone who loves a good storyline with a plot and brilliant acting!

I might add grunge is the most underrated genre in the music industry. This CD also has some other great songs such as &quot;Come As You Are&quot;, &quot;All Apologies&quot;, and &quot;Lithium&quot;. BUY THIS CD!!!
B00006FXB6|5.0|I bought this cd after I saw the video for \\"No One Knows.\\" I don't usually buy cd's either but Dave Grohl played on this album so I decide to go for it. When I got it I put it on and listened to it all the way through. By the end I had a big smile on my face knowing that I made a good (Ebay) purchase. I know what it is like to buy a mediocre album that you listen to for a while and then gets lost in the back of you cd case for you to later find and ask yourself, \\"Why did I buy that?\\" This is most definately not one of those albums. It has incredible range and I love all but one song which I don't hate but would rather do without. One of the best is Sky Is Fallin'. So even if you don't want to buy the cd do yourself a favor and at least download it.
B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection is a true greatest hits album.  It contains the songs that made Madonna a household name back in the '80's.  Songs like &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, &quot;Material Girl&quot;, &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; are instantly recognizable to anyone who loved the '80's and its music.  Some are witty, many are controversial, all are fun.  Although Madonna has re-invented herself on a regular basis, and has never been out of the spotlight in 20 years, this album will always be Madonna to those of us who grew up listening to her songs and following her career in the '80's.

0793927501|4.0|This film is one I recommend...an interesting character exploration of Charles and Bob develops as they undergo threat after threat to their lives...the interplay between the two brings out the best and the worst of human nature and values.  I appreciated this film's depiction of a truth found in life:  That those who have that which others seek (be it money, fame, success, respect, accomplishments, etc.) must always be cautious and wary of those around them and their motives for befriending or being involved with them.  I appreciated this film because it depicted this predicament very well...who can be trusted?  What are other's motives?  It also illustrated that there are those of principle and honor...no matter what the provocation.   <br /> <br />The beautiful videography of the Canadian Rockies...the musical score...and the bear encounters were all superbly done. <br /> <br />I enjoyed watching this very well made film...and must also add that Anthony Hopkins has again given us an excellent performance of a highly intelligent man--the type of character he is perfect in portraying. <br /> <br />I highly recommend The Edge.
B00005JL7Q|1.0|Good god, what is wrong with American Movie studios?  About A Boy has got to be one of the worst DVD covers I have ever seen.  Not only has the movie logo been destroyed and placed horizontally, but do we have to have giant quotes all over the front of the box?  Isn't that normally reserved for the back? <br />I understand that in this day and age of over-marketing, any chance  you get to get someone to buy your product is more important than the integrity of the product.  And that is why giant quotes and huge, uneccessary type adorns most DVD and music releases.  But why can't that be placed on the back of the package or on a sticker.  I don't want to look at that cover everytime I reach for the DVD to play it.  Maybe they thought I needed to be reminded how hilarious the movie is, even though I've purchased it and plan to watch it again and again.  I guess it is a good reminder...
B000002KIE|4.0|Like I said above, I'm no music expert, and I definitely don't know all there is to know about punk or the history thereof. But I will say what I know: I agree with another reviewer that recognizes that the Sex Pistols did not invent punk and were not the first. There were others, garage bands (much notably The Alice Cooper Group, who thrived on the shocking punk/frightening image before it was popular), who were influenced by The Who, The Doors, etc. This is not a bad thing, just because they were not the first does not mean that they did not help modify punk music before it had a genre of its own. This album, their only album, certainly was/is among the greatest landmarks in punk's history. Even non-punks/fans of punk music (like myself) can recognize its importance, which proves how great it was/is. I applaud The Sex Pistols for their sole opus.
B000001IMX|4.0|This is the only Suicidal Tendencies album worth owning, but MAN is it good. This is one of the first punk albums I bought back in the eighties and today it still stands up completely. It may not be as relevant or politcal as Dead Kennedys, but it's still loaded with a bunch of classics including, \\"Institutionalized\\", \\"I Saw Your Mommy\\", \\"Suicidal Failure\\", \\"Subliminal\\". Mike Muir's everyteen vocals are perfect and the tight guitar work is phenominal. Get this album.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I'm not a Sade fan, nor do I listen to R&B through choice. My 2nd favorite CDs at the moment are Ibiza mixes (\\"Trance\\") and Coldplay. So to confess that \\"Best of Sade\\" is top of my play list is in one sense a little embarassing. But this is such a good album! Unlike a previous reviewer who has a copy to play at home and another in the car - for me this is not car music. Road noise would kill the subtleties of this music. I enjoy this when alone, or if I want to create a \\"mood\\" for an evening with a female companion. The collection of songs blends and flows beautifully. The choice of \\"Pearls\\" to finish the collection is inspired. This is not lightweight fluff, nor is Sade's voice \\"thin\\" (in comparison to what?). I find it hard to believe that anyone but the most finickety Sade fan could be disappointed by this collection.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Lights, camera....DAZZLE ME!   Talk about a non-stop ride from start to finish.  Do you guys know just how hard it is to shoot a musical?  Wow!  I was thoroughly impressed with the singing talents of our beautiful starlets, the characters personalities, the vivid style of the choreography, the flow of the entire plot...do you get the point?<br />This should fair well come Oscar time.  I really don't need to see the stage version but I'd still like to someday.  It's a lot easier to see on the big screen than Moulin Rouge was...it's not as crazy in the mtv-style editing dept. as Rouge was, this was considerably easier on the eyes to view. <br />The songs were excellent, the humor on target, the style, glamour, and glitz well-portrayed....as Gere says, \\"This *is* Chicago!\\"
B00006690G|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever heard.  He really cut down on the foul language and stuff (and I'm not saying that's bad or good, im just saying it) and there's so much variety.  I didn't think I'd like him at first either but give him a chance!
0060523794|5.0|I am glad I read the book before reading the reviews on this site since my perceptions of Gerstner's narration did not get coloured by some of the writings on this site! It is also possible that being a non-IBMer, I may have taken many of the pronouncements in the book on a face value as compared to the guys who probably had a personal and possibly more insightful encounter with Gersten's leadership style from within the organization.<br />Anyway, all said and done, I must confess that the book and its contents have impressed me a great deal. Some of the key impressions I walked away with after reading the book are:<br />a. Lou is a no nonsense leader, somewhat like his other famous contemporary CEO - Jack Welch. A total focus on execution and very little tolerance for usual organisational BS!<BR>b. But, unlike Jack, Lou does not come across as a guy full of himself! The fact that Lou starts with a broad disclaimer that this book is no autobiography but simply his account of what happened at IBM in last decade tells you a lot about the difference in two personalities.  <BR>c. Although it is obvious that both men were looking at e-business from rather different perspectives (one as a technology provider and other a user of technology), it is probably not coincidental that both of them were amongst the greatest proponents of e-business and recognised a huge opportunity in leveraging e-business for their respective businesses.<BR>d. Till the end, Lou remained faithful to the initial pronouncements he made immediately after joining IBM about &quot;vision&quot;. The book is short on &quot;CEO Vision stuff&quot; but full of illustrations on his obsession with execution and painstaking but vital details required for successful organisational transformation.  <br />The section that left the greatest impression on me was chapter 26 - where Lou debates about lessons learnt from &quot;centralization vs. decentralization&quot;. Having seen many CEOs struggle with the critical issue of trying to create a &quot;synergistic/integrated&quot; strategy, Gerstner's candid but insightful observations on this vital issue were indeed insightful. For someone who has been visibly successful in driving a synergistic/integrated strategy for a mammoth organization like IBM, it was pleasantly surprising to see Lou caution other business leaders from blindly adopting the &quot;synergy/integration&quot; mantra! Hope such warnings from a veteran who has been there, do not fall on deaf ears.  <br />Business acumen and the guts to step back and take a fresh look at critical issues rather that blindly following the prevailing &quot;industry trends&quot; and &quot;analyst wisdom&quot; is what make an extraordinary leader stand out in the crowd. By going against the prevailing wisdom that downsizing the organization by spinning off smaller size nimble entities is the only &quot;viable&quot; approach for IBM, Gerstner not only managed to successfully preserve IBM as a US &quot;national treasure&quot; but forcefully demonstrated that for those who dare...there is always a better way forward! <br />Judging by other reviews on this web site, some of my above observations may look rather oversimplified and naïve to the guys who had the misfortune of being on the receiving end of Gerstner's brash style. However, as they say - the proof of the pudding is in eating! Seeing an \\"integrated IBM\\" of today with robust financials and a dominant industry position is any day a much better proposition than attempting a hypothetical \\"what if\\" analysis about a disparate group of \\"baby-IBMs\\" that may have resulted from the break-up of IBM a decade ago!
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a story, not about the murder of a young girl, or the tracking down of the murderer, but about everyone that is touched by the murder and how they adapt, grow and continue their lives. It is also about the murdered child, Susie Salmon, coming to terms with leaving her family behind on Earth. The story is told through the eyes of the murdered child as she watches from heaven. Her family is devastated,and begins to fall apart as her parents and siblings cope with the loss.  They begin to disconnect from each other as she observes them.  As Susie watches, she yearns to intervene somehow, as much as she yearns for a life that was cut short.  This was a very emotional story, and the thought of those in Heaven being so close was actually settling to me.  When Susie's family thinks of her she can hear their thoughts and that was a good feeling also. This was a very good story, told by a very talented writer.  There are a few incidents that I felt took away from this story.  One is a scene where Susie interacts with a young man she had been fond of, and some of the scenes that deal with the murderer added a sense of discord to the story.  Alice Sebold has written a beautiful story dealing with a horrible situation and has done a sensational job in evoking emotion and thought.
B00006690G|3.0|I came into this album with an open mind, I had heard em's earlier stuff and thought it was cool, this album has like 4 good tracks, the rest are garbage. What makes alot of this album wack is the lack of battle raps and hard beats, theres too much of Eminem whining and trying to sing his raps and it sounds so wack. Don't get me started on the production, DRE still can lay it down but this album just doesnt have that head nodding zone out dopeness. I really dont understand all the heads on here talking about how dope this is, these cats obviously havent heard of Ras Kass and Del and E40 and the list can go on and on of tighter MC's than M&M. Good Songs...Business, Drips, When the Music Stops (Tightest Production on album and Bizarre's Bars make this my favorite), Til I Collapse (Cant F with Nate Dogg). Wack Songs...Without me (WTF? I know he aint tryin to cover Malcom Mclaren's Buffalo girls go around the outside) My dad gone Crazy, White America, Soldier Song.

6304493681|4.0|The speed of this movie makes it *really* difficult to follow. I like to think of myself as a smart person. I watched it the first time, and I didn't get it. I watched it the second and third times, and I didn't get it. I read the manga (which had a completely different tone), then watched it again, and now I *sorta* get it. It's all very interesting, but it's hard to keep track of what the characters are actually *trying to do*. \\"Okay, why is Kusanagi fighting this tank again?\\"<br />But, it's definitely a Good Film. What starts as a hunt for a malicious hacker, transforms into a journey to discover the nature of self.<br />Major Motoko Kusanagi, while the protagonist of the film, cannot fairly be called a hero. After the abovementioned tank has been destroyed, just when you're about to forget about it, the camera focuses on its dead pilot. Kusanagi and her partner have become completely jaded to the concept of death. This is an important trait of Kusanagi throughout the film. Without giving too much away, her decision at the end of the film is made entirely based on her lack of concern for the survival of her own identity.<br />Ghost in the Shell is a beautifully made movie, so that if you have trouble following the plot, the animation will probably be enough to keep you watching regardless. But there is definitely more to this movie than eye candy, and to dismiss it as such upon one viewing is to do yourself a disservice.

B0000541AM|4.0|This film is an adaptation of Anabasis by Xenophon, not The Odyssey by Homer, which tells the story of Greek mercenaries being stranded in Persia after the Persian leader Cyrus was killed in battle. Further, The Warriors and Anabasis share the same dramatic ending of finding safety by the sea (and Xenophon with his famous quote \\"Thalassa, thalassa! (the sea, the sea!)\\".<br />The film was contoversial in 1979 when it was released, but it is good campy fun. I first saw it on Halloween on HBO in 1980 when I was in sixth grade. Far from inspiring my friends and me to participate in gang related violence, the film only inspired u to put empty beer bottles on the tips of our fingers and bang them in unison.<br />The Warriors is a great, absorbing film with very broad acting and with lots of attitude. I wouldn't want to meet the leader of the Grammercy Riffs in a dark alley.
B000071ZZI|4.0|This is what a action movie should be. Not just all action pay attention XXX, Ballistic &amp; Ecks IT SHOULD HAVE A GOOD PLOT ALSO. Matt Damon does a fine job playing Bourne. It had good characters as well as a great plot.
B00006CXXU|5.0|First, let me preface this by saying that I am a black, STRAIGHT male who is more into soulful R&B (such as Maxwell, India Arie, Badu, Scott, etc) than anything else - however on a whim - I picked up Christina's CD to see if she really was making a true attempt to break into this genre - all I can say is that I listened to the whole CD without skipping a track, something that I have not done with a CD in a long time. I am not afraid to say that I prefer a nice quantity of songs for my $15 bucks either and thats another reason I picked up the CD. You will not get 10 songs like Whitney gave us, Aguilera gives us 16 tracks with 4 amazing interludes that keep your attention. For young guys who respect women, you will also relate and probably have gone through some of the issues that Aguilera discusses about her men, surprisingly. I will run down the songs, and hope this helps sway some of the R&B listeners who might be reading these posts to get an idea of the change this girl has made. I am convinced now - get her butt on BET.<br />1. Stripped Interlude Part 1 - CA comes out with this bangin mix of all her haters, media and artists alike, and basically says - its my (...) turn to talk now - go head!<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down (featuring L'il Kim) - Not bad. This is a little bit poppish, but has a tight, rhythmic beat that will have your head boppin. Kim lays down a lazy, but acceptable rap here.<br />3. Walk Away - This is one of the best songs I have EVER heard from an artist of today. I seriously could hear CA sing in tones like Erykah Badu, Etta James, etc all in one song. You will not believe the expression that comes out of Christina here - it does not even sound like her.<br />4. Fighter - Dang, CA gets rockish here. Not really my thing, but another head bopper. This could be a hit single.<br />5/6. Infatuation (Interlude precedes it) - I like this one. Latin rhythm, talking about the early stages of love. Nice, tight beat.<br />7/8. Loving Me 4 for Me (Interludeprecedes it) - Tight. Tight. Tight. This is a love-making song folks. Talking about loving women for who they are - very sexy, breathy vocals almost here.<br />9. Impossible (w/ Alicia Keys) - Favorite song off the album. This song is very Alicia in terms of the amount of emotion that CA puts into her vocals. There are no remnants of pop here - just soul. Also, if this is released as a single - CA will find herself getting urban market play - its that good.<br />10. Underappreciated - Ok song here, not to much to report on it.<br />11. Beautiful - Nice pop song. Again, not really my thing - but <BR>her vocals demand respect here like no other song on the album.<br />12. Make Over - CA goes rock here, but not as good as her Fighter song. Ok.<br />13. Cruz - Uh-oh, CA goes a little country here, lol! ...and it somehow works.<br />14. Soar - She kills it on the song b/c she hits the high notes that everyone knows she's known for. A little poppish, but her vocals make it actually pretty good.<br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours - CA gets back to the very good, R&B here - talking about a one-night stand with a very tight beat. I really like this one.<br />16. Dirrty - I ain't gonna lie, as a hip-hop fan this song was not all that to listen to (critique), BUT its a great club joint which makes it more enjoyable.<br />17. Stripped, Part 2 - Nice interlude here, talking about how she is not at all what everyone thinks she is - a slut, etc. Very good and it has a purpose.<br />18. A Voice Within - Inspirational song to all haters...pop, but good pop.<br />19. I'm OK - This one is another 'woah'! I had to listen to it twice and I am not sure which genre I would put it in, maybe blues. But CA talks about the abuse she suffered from her father and the way it has impacted her life. Those who have been through something like it will have a tear in their eye.<BR> <BR>20. Keep Singing My Singing - Uplifting ending to album, nice song.<br />There you go, five songs that absolutely blew meaway which is way more than most hip/hop and R&B albums of today. I ain't gonna lie - she may dress like a ..., but she is on another level with me now. I still can't believe she put out a record like this.
B00006CXXU|5.0|it really doesnt matter.  Christina can sing.  Well.  Since we're in the year of the \\"I'm Insane/Got Family Problems\\" album (you know who all of them are), it's only expected that the ethnic (like mariah) girl who really can sing (like mariah) would realize that she doesnt have to get naked (like mariah)or married ar a young age (like mariah) to be successful. she just needs to put on her clothes and sing.<BR>    Stripped is a beautifully organized, fluid and well assembled album. A balance of ballads and up-tempo songs, Aguilera demonstrates her vocal range and her ability to cover any style around.  <BR>    \\"Dirrty\\" is a great song, and a great choice for a first single. Since everyone expects her to be a \\"skank\\", she might as well play off of that bad publicity and promote an album that should easily win several grammies, then release the (hopefully grammy winning, hint hint people) \\"Beautiful\\".  Good move.  <BR>   \\"Loving me 4 me\\" (gorgeous), \\"Make Over\\", \\"Cruz\\", \\"Impossible\\"(by alicia keys), --even the now-worn out anthem to life and love \\"Beautiful\\"  remind us how talented the girl is.  We're so eager to desire her to live a cookie-cutout pop star life, and then feign disgust when she is true to herself (and this is not an act, unlike some of those silicon-supported, lip syching artists with whom she is compared). <BR>   Not convinced?  Cant get over her look?  Here's a suggestion: open your ears, close your eyes, shut your mouth, and let her open hers. She's got something to get off her chest, and it isnt her top.

B00005JKZT|5.0|What's with people rating this movie one star? Because it doesn't follow the books perfectly? What a bunch of bologne. J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is one of the most overrated set of books of all time. Certainly the story and world Tolkien created are classic masterpieces, but Tolkien was not an accomplished author, and his writing skills leave a lot to be desired.<br />Enter the films. Years ago when I heard the trilogy was being made into a live action film I was both excited and worried. Excited that the one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time would be put to the big screen and worried because hollywood almost always takes great ideas and turns them to garbage. My review of Fellowship of the Ring explains how delighted I was not only to see the film done competently but incredibly well. I was now no long worried about any of the following films; I could just be excited.<br />I must confess that I am a bit confused at why Peter Jackson took even more liberties with this film than even Fellowship of the Ring. Some acts like trying to make the audience believe Aragorn fell off a cliff and died doesn't make sense. I understand that a screenplay and a novel can't be told the same way, but is there anyone who doesn't know that the king in Return of the King is Aragorn? He can't die, so adding a scene like that that wasn't in the book just seemed to be redundant.<br />The other difference that most people have a problem with (besides the Elves appearing) is that of Faramir's character. Well, despite that one of Tolkien's biggest weaknesses in the writing department is characterization, Faramir was established as a noble soul who did not try to take the ring from Frodo. However, after seeing the film several times I don't think Jackson was wrong to change the events involving Faramir. It's important for one to remember that a filmmaker has only 2-3 hours in which to tell a story. Jackson has already portrayed that the ring is so powerful that no man can turn it away. Too much explaination would have been needed for the non-book reading audience had Faramir acted exactly as he had in the book. In the end, Faramir's actions do not betray his character. He does not take the One Ring and sets Frodo free to continue his journey. Only the way about it is different.<br />People complain also that the elves do not show up in the book as they do in the film. What poppycock really. It's one of the most powerful scenes in the film and is something that happens in the overall story anyway. Jackson only changes the timeframe in which it happens. The same is true with Eomir showing up at the end with Gandalf. Cinematically it's much better to have Eomir showing up to save the day than some other character you've never heard of. Talk about contrived plot developement.<br />Finally readers of the book know that the end of the Two Towers deals with the She-spider-creature Shelob. Jackson was as wise to move this to the next film as he was to move Borimir's death to the first.<br />The fact is, Jackson loves The Lord of the Rings. He's trying to make the best films possible, and I'm glad he's a skillful enough filmmaker to know that Tolkien's books could never be made into a movie as they are written. If it weren't for the fantastic story and world he created, the books would be garbage. Jackson did take some liberties with the story to make these films, and certainly some are questionable. However, it shouldn't be surprising that the only people that bash on the film also happen to be Tolkien bootlickers who think any deviation from the books is blasphemy. I and the millions of others (whether they know it or not) who helped make this movie into one of the biggest boxoffice successes of all time are certainly happy with the exemplary work Jackson and Co. did in carrying Tolkiens masterpiece books into masterpiece films.an turn it away.

B00005JLSC|4.0|I am a great fan of the musical idiom (and Fosse, in particular), and saw the recent revival  of \\"Chicago\\" on Broadway with Ann R. and Bebe N. just prior to its official opening.  I felt that the movie (and its dance sequences) was somewhat uneven, but was wowed by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who more than lived up to the challenge of her role.  Too often I thought that Rene Z. was aping Jennifer Tilly (in \\"Bullets Over Broadway\\") and that she wasn't nearly the musical/dancing match for Rene Z.  But, most of all, Richard Gere's shortcomings to sell his part as a singer and dancer detracted from the role... I would rather have seen an ancient Jerry Orbach reprise that role, as Gere was only competent when the script called for acting talent, where his ability to play the smug part of Billy worked for me.  The production values, photography, and sets were outstanding and, in the end, I was very glad that the movie had been made.  Despite all of the above carping, I look forward to eventually owning the DVD, and especially to find out why the gem of a song \\"Class\\" didn't make it into the final cut.  How wonderful it is that Hollywood in the last 2 years has finally seen fit to bring us some \\"in your face\\" musicals (read: \\"Moulin Rouge\\"), and hope that the much discussed \\"Guys and Dolls\\" continues that trend.
B00000099Y|5.0|It's odd.  Either the reviews below give this cd one star or they give it five stars.  I must admit, I wasn't always a Tool fan.  I got into Tool looking for the next hard heavy metal act.  I too felt all the songs were repetitive and boring.  I too couldn't understand what all the hooplah was.  It's hard to explain why I really enjoy Tool now.<br />Essentially, you have to give the record a chance.  You can't listen to it nonchalantly once through and expect to understand it.  This isn't something you can play for about 5 minutes and grasp it.  To listen to Tool, you have to sit down and really listen to it.  Each time you listen you notice something else, and the experience changes.  Personally, I love the lyrical content that Tool offers.  Each person takes from Tool what they can.  Understand though, you'll never start to get Tool unless you make an effort to.
B00006RIO7|5.0|The soundtrack is really entertaining: similar to the Broadway Cast Recordings but different. Part of the praise is owed to the great performances by all the actors. But the true star of the cast album is whoever did the orchestrations. I was dreading &quot;new interpretations&quot; of the songs, but the playful new arrangements make John Kander's music sound fresh and, in some cases, even more 1920s authentic. So, hats off to the orchestrator. As the lyricist Fred Ebb once said in a different context: &quot;You've made the old turkey gobble again.&quot;

B00000K19E|5.0|I love The Matrix.  It's a great movie that reaches deep within the human psyche and deals with what could easily be considered one of today's biggest fears--the fear of technology and what kind of negative impact it could have on today's society.  It tells the story of Neo (Keanu Reeves), who works for a large, faceless corporation by day and who is a system hacker by night.  One night, however, he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who takes him to see her superior, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and that's when the REAL fun begins.<br />I gave this DVD a high rating simply because everything about the movie was excellent.  I was very impressed by Keanu Reeves in the role of Neo--he has come a long way from his Bill and Ted days, and can play any part with flair and panache.  Carrie-Anne Moss was good as Trinity, and Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus was dazzling.  I also loved Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith, the psycho nutjob who does everything he can to destroy Morpheus and Company.<br />The best part about this movie is that it blends the action and storytelling so well, unlike most action films these days, which tend to be all action and no plot.  The Matrix has a good, well thought-out plot that fits in quite nicely around the action scenes and makes the movie very enjoyable.<br />All in all, a wonderful film.  I'm looking forward to the sequels.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|great, thought-provoking movie...you'll probably have to watch it a couple of times and spend time pondering it before you come up with your own conclusions.
B00005JKJA|1.0|To begin with, I was nearly unable to start the movie on my PC !! That is because the menus are quite unusual and difficult to use. Also there are some strange guidelines like :  Watch out carefully when you see a shade (abat-jour in french) ,  What are the keys ,  Did you hear the title of the movie Adam is working on ?  etc. That is quite unusual on DVDs.<BR>Concerning the movie itself, there are actually a few good elements in it, especially Naomi Watts who is able to simulate all the  tats d'me  of main character Betty and who renders them well ; however the general impression that emerges from Mulholland Drive is one of great sadness, especially near the end. The beginning is very confusing and depicts a sort of strange car crash at night, while a brunette called Rita is threatened by a man wielding a gun. She seems to be the only survivor, but instead of calling for help,  she hides away and finally finds a refuge in a flat that she decides to squat. At this point, all the charaters seem to be staring in the darkness at some city lights below in the distance.<BR>Then, the story proceeds with Adam Kasher not accepting Camilla Rhodes as the replacement for his main female role ; then later on he refuses Betty again (although Betty had been  prepared  in detail in the hands of another older man who simulates making love with her while she simulates having a virtual orgasm, in front of a crowde of movie makers); then blonde Betty and  brunette Rita go together and discover love, while Adam's wife deceives him and invites Gene -from Clean Gene- to rape her at home, in the conjugal bed. Then Betty continues going down, carried by Rita who stimulates her and initiates her to Lesbianship, pulling out when Betty gets too carried away. As a result, Betty goes into a severe depression and finally seems to be reaching a place of her mind than even her parents would have avoided... Finally, the word of the end, which seems also to be the motto of the movie is Silenio . So all this depressing story ends up in the middle of a psychologic nowhere; that is to say, there is actually no end ; and because the beginning was an equally strange no-beginning, nothing much remains of this movie.<BR>In fact I would warn depressed people from watching this movie. I found it so sad that I opened myself a bottle of Chteau Audinet french white wine which helped me gulp the story ; otherwise I do not think I would have been able to reach the end safely !!! (but remember alcohol may also be a health hazard)<BR>As a conclusion, I do not understand what message this movie was supposed to carry, but whatever the message, it was not necessary to make such a sad movie to convey it.
0671027344|4.0|The whole time I was reading this book, I was thinking, \\"This sounds like S.E. Hinton could have written parts of this story.\\"  This book relly reminded me of several of her books, including Tex and Taming the Star Runner.  The sex, the drugs, the hidden endings.  Charlie's life was turned upsidown when his friend comitted suicide.  Now he is a freshman in high school...As I went through the book (which I read in one sitting), I found myself not really being able to relate to Charlie and his situations.  Yes, I have friends that are seniors (which are all of the friends Charlie has), but I found that the constant drug usage was something that I just don't relate well with.  But I did feel like I knew Charlie when he was talking about the way he thinks about people.  And the way he feels.  The author did a marvelous job of creating Charlie and making his emotions seem real.  Gold star for that one.  But overall, The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a good book.  Hard to believe at times, but at others, so perfect it's hard to believe that someone could actually write something that expresses human emotion so well...I enjoyed this book, and I belive just about anyone who picks it up will too.
B00003CXXM|5.0|They should have changed the name when they changed the story, but they didn't.<BR>However, this is a GREAT movie. It came out about a week after the quirky spielberg and tom cruise movie &quot;Minority Report&quot;, It soon matched &quot;minority&quot; boxoffice sales, then far out-grossed it's per theater showing as people talked it up and up. If you missed this top shelf movie, you missed great first unit direction, a great story, and startiling acting. Now you can own it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|No disrespect to you Diana Krall fans out there, as I do have a couple of her CDs myself, but I fail to see how Diana Krall fans can Norah Jones' CD boring when Krall's voice is even MORE BORING! I enjoy Krall's piano playing (genius!), but her voice? It's as exciting as a cement brick!! <br />Norah's voice has much more character and substance. Yes, she has touches of Billie and Nona, SO WHAT?? Whitney was compared to Lena Horne! Mica Paris to the great Dionne Warwick, Mariah Carey to Whitney Houston! They're always gonna be finding somebody to compare you to. Is that any reason to write the girl's talent off? Or to dis her CD? Give her a break! This CD is a masterpiece. The girl is doing her thing, and doing it well I might add. <br />For those of you having doubts, give this CD a chance. It will grow on you- I guarantee it. This girl is gonna blow up big. She's talented, beautiful and I'd put her poster up on my wall next to the sexy one of Dianna Krall bending over and touching those gorgeous legs of hers. Ain't it nice to know that sex still sells? I bought that Dianna Krall CD just for that hot photo of her touching her legs...and...Oh...yeah--and her piano playing too! But NOT her voice! I bought Norah Jones' CD for that! <BR>Buy this CD! Two thumbs up folks!Norah Jones Rocks!
B000068TPN|5.0|A big thank you to Mel Gibson and team for this movie is really good !! I enjoyed it from start to finish. It is full of action, the scenario is good, the pace is perfect, the characters are great and sincere, the dialogues excellent, and also there is a permanent good humor. So everything is good in this war movie. Mel Gibson even managed to make me laugh on several occasions, and it's the first time I ever laughed during a war movie...<BR>The whole movie is highly entertaining, and that's definitely the best war movie I've ever watched.
0156012197|5.0|This book was known by every child in my country. I was delighted to discover that some people in the US know about it too -- I wish there were much more of them, and this is why I came searching for it in order to give a few copies to the people I care about. I briefly read the reviews (I don't need a review for myself, I feel this book) and many were talking about either entertainment or fiction. I'd like to make a statement that this book is none of the two, but something that just can't be classified, like a true masterpiece can't. This book is something that stands way out from any other children's products that I've seen and that money can buy.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The flaming lips is easily my favorite modern band.  I have long been a fan since \\"Priest.\\"  I have to admit, when I first purchased this album, I was disappointed.  I was hoping for something along the lines of \\"clouds\\".....but instead, this initially sounded like \\"soft bulletin,\\" which is not my favorite of theirs (although there are some stellar tracks on that album).  despite being unimpressed, i continued to play the album, hoping it would click.....and it did...tremendously.  This album is fantastic to listen to. I especially came to appreciate it after some rather \\"inspirational\\" moments, which dramatically enhanced the sound.  While people have compared this to trip hop, i hear more early floyd.  While certainly happier than floyd, their ability to take you to another level is unlike anything i have heard since meddle and animals.  Listen to this album on headphones and if so inclined while inspired.....
B000001Y2U|5.0|I don't understand why so many people hate Marilyn Manson like they do. Marilyn Manson is no different from any other hard rock/heavy metal singer. Sure, he's gothic! OF course, he's satanic! But that's what makes him so cool. However, Mr. Manson does like to speak against God. So if you're religious in any way, my best advice is for you to avoid this album. It has some very explicit lyrics, many of which I can't write in this review. And even though his shock-rock music isn't for all tastes, he's certainly one of the best gothic entertainers out there. In this album, Mr. Manson produces some of the most electrifying shock-rock ever heard. Heck, even Gene Simmons (Kiss) and Alice Cooper never dreamed of taking things quite this far.<br /> The disc kicks off with the \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\" which makes an excellent opening track. Then from there it's \\"Beautiful People\\", one of the best songs ever! \\"The Reflecting God\\" is tight. \\"Man That You Fear\\" is very moving and depressing, but that's what makes it a classic. Also, let's not forget about the title track, \\"Antichrist Superstar\\", a song so incredible that it gives me chills and makes me wanna cheer along with it. I love it!!! \\"Deformography\\" is pretty tight. \\"Cryptorchild\\" is probably the least best song on this album, but still cool though.<br />I would strongly recommend this album to those who aren't easily offended. Christians who hear this music will not be pleased. As an atheist, this kind of music doesn't offend me the least bit. Bottomline: I LOVE IT!!!! Peace.
B00005JKZT|5.0|...If you truly took the time to read the books and understand the history of Middle Earth, you would also realize that there is WAY TOO MUCH to put in a movie. Give Petie some credit... this movie was shelved for many years because no one could put it together! The movie is a THEATRICAL REPRESENTATION of the books... and is based on the books. Give the guy some credit for adding in a few things for entertainment value. I too was a little dissapointed that many things were left out of the movies, but let's face it... if complete detail was utilized... this trilogy would have been nothing shy of 20 hours long! The movies are wonderful people... and although not exactly like the books... still an exceptional piece of work for Peter Jackson....
B000002UB3|5.0|I really like this album.  It's one of the main cds I listen to.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Look I don't care if you buy this or just rent it, I just want you to watch this mini-series. Its &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; with a storyline and interesting characters. Just remember these words, WATCH THIS OR REGRET MISSING THE GREATEST MINI-SERIES OF ALL TIME, WATCH IT, WATCH IT NOW(or later).
B000070WJE|4.0|Try to remember if you can (or imagine if you can't), a time long ago, when the US and UK music scenes were more or less the same.  If an artist was really successful on one side of the Atlantic, you could make a large bet on him repeating the performance on the other side.  Over the past 10 years though, this has happened less and less frequently.  We are now at a point where popular music is more homogeneous than at any other point during the past 150 years, but Europe and America seem to have developed something of an aversion to each other's favourites.  Whatever the cause of this schism, be it cultural expectations or record company politics, if the trend is to be halted, then this new offering from the UK's favourite brat prince is the place to start.   <br />It's very hard to sum up the appeal of Robbie Williams, in Europe he cuts across gender and generation gaps, but could never be described as bland, or even conventional, which this his fifth studio album graphically demonstrates.  Style's and genre's change from one track to the next, a concept album it certainly isn't, but the pervading mood of introspection throughout gives Escapology a sense of cohesion that you really wouldn't expect from such a supposedly wayward egotist as Williams.  All tracks on this set are good, but some are superb.  For me, the real standout is &quot;Feel&quot; &quot;I've got too much life running through my veins, going to waste&quot;, really seems to sum up the public perception of Robbie.  How much of it is ironic, I'll leave for you to decide.<br />I really enjoyed this album.  Though different in many ways's from Robbie's last original album, &quot;Sing when you're winning&quot; Escapology has all the traits of an album that like a good wine will age well in its bottle (or jewel case).   The only thing I can think of that will stop this from being just as successful in the US as it has been in the UK, might be that the cocktail of self depreciating humour, irony and subtlyserved up here might be too rich for the palette of the average N-sync fan.  Far from being an aging clone from a broken boy band, Robbie Williams has proven himself to be a mature artist, who actually might have something to say for himself, a man of substance beneath the image.  Something that could never be said of Mr Timberlake and Co!
B00005JLRR|4.0|Finally, a Trek movie that I can really enjoy. Star Trek Nemesis is hands down the best Trek movie since Wrath of Kahn. Unlike some of the other Trek movies that move to slowly and seem to drag on and on and on, Nemesis takes a very fast paced  approach. This particular one is different from the others in the fact that its a darker movie. A lot darker than I expected it be. It has a differnet feel to it that I as a Trek fan am not used to when it comes to Trek movies. But I gladly welcome it. Perhaps this is what Trek needed. A fresh new feel. Writer John Logan does just that by writing an awesome story. One of the reasons I got excited about Nemesis was because Logan had written it. Remember, this is the same guy who wrote 'Gladiator', one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting in Nemesis is great in my opinion. Not without problems, but certainly better than what we got from Insurrection. Patrick Steward gives an excellent performance as Jean Luc Picard. Even better is Tom Hardy, who plays the character of Shinzon. Tom Hardy is the best thing to happen to Star Trek since...well...Kahn. If you don't go for the acting then certainly go for the actions scenes. Finally, we get to see the Starship Enterprise E show what she can do. Ever since First Contact I've wanting to see what she could  handle. But in this latest feature, the Enterprise almost doesn't make it, really. As for Data, you'll just have to see if that rumor is true.
0805062971|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Fight Club\\" was referred to me by a friend. Palahniuk presents a vivid world of disgruntled men who are searching to find the meaning of life through a boxing club. The storyline and characters are very strong affect on me. I noticed that I would repeatedly question my beliefs on materialism. Overall, I felt that the novel and the movie where identical.  The book offers a different variation of the beginning and ending of the story. Also, the events in the book are in different sequences than presented in the movie. I would strongly recommend this novel to anyone who has interest in the movie or novels which are hard to put down. Enjoy!
B00000JGHM|5.0|I will never get sick of seeing this movie. I've worn out 2 VHS tapes and have plans to buy the DVD soon. Timeless. I think that says enough.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Finally! Someone made a FABULOUS movie musical! A movie musical that actually gives you the same leaving-the-theater-euphoria usually only experienced at live shows. I love the Broadway version of CHICAGO and was so incredibly pleasantly suprised when I went to see the movie (with some theater friends) and ADORED it (so did the theater friends!). <br />This is one of the few movie musicals that actually translates well on-screen. It is what CABARET only wished it could be. The raw, palpitating energy is phenomenal. And, they gave a nod to the Great White Way by including Dedriee Goodwin and Chita Rivera in the cast list-- bravo!<br />Renee Zellweger CAN sing AND dance! Very impressive. Her singing voice is lovely...very earthy and expressive. Her dancing matches Catherine Zeta-Jones' and her acting is superb. What a relief! Her Roxie is reminiscent of Marylin Monroe, but it is very effective.<br />Of course, Catherine Zeta-Jones is sexy as usual. And we knew she could sing and dance, because, well, that's how she got her start. It is cool to see her finally get to use it on screen.<br />Richard Gere: well. He is good. I was very happy with his tap dancing. And, well, he plays the cocky attorney flawlessly. But his singing is, er, a bit shaky. I was amazed at his high notes--quite pure and on-key. He's just very nasal. Probably because he's untrained, but it just bothered me a little. I longed for Jerry Orbach.<br />Watch for the Cell Block Tango-- it's breathtaking! And Queen Latifah is really a kick-butt Mama Morton.(Why did they never think of a soulful Mama for the stage version beats me-- she rocked!) <br />The only songs I missed were \\"Class\\" and \\"A Little Bit of Good In Everyone\\" (Mary Sunshine was highly miscast, but oh well.)<br />Words cannot describe this one. Go see it, and see it in theaters. It's worth every penny. And lets all thank the producers of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" for bringing back musicals... it was worth watching Nicole Kidman try to sing for the reward Hollywood has reaped with this absolutely perfect CHICAGO. And all that jazz!
0345451325|4.0|... I have a different reason for placing this 'review'.<BR>I'm wondering whether LST Vankan from Hoensbroek (NL) is called Lars, and whether he lives/lived in the Kouvenderstraat several years ago.<br />If so (and if he's reading this by any chance), can you contact me? I wonder how you're doing...<br />See ya,
0783240236|3.0|This film is of course a classic, but I was rather dissapointed when I saw it.  Hitchcock is usually the master of suspense, but in this movie, for example, when everyone is sitting in the livingroom terrified for ten minutes, it just gets boring. There is also a lot of unimportant conversation which is rather dull and has nothing to do with the plot.  It finally gets interesting after 45 minutes, but even then it's mediocre.  I only give this three stars because of some great chase scenes, though I really wish I could give it a 2.5.  There is one part, where a man lights a match when he is standing is gasoline, and when he blows up, it just shows you four stills of Tippi Hendricks horrified face, which was not very convincing.  In fact, my sister and I laughed so hard we had to rewind and watch it four times!  If you can get through the first half, this movie is pretty good.
0743455967|5.0|The book opens with something that can best be described as King's first attempt to his memoirs. Starting with the description of what he thinks are his first memories, he guides us through his youth of poverty, a time in which he started to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. In a colourful narrative he deals with the darkest period of his life, showing that nothing can steal away his energy to prove himself. When he is financially at his lowest point, a first success as an author is about to happen: the publishing of Carrie.<br />In the second part of this book Stephen King opens Fazza's writing toolbox. Not to give you a textbook version of a \\"Creative Writing\\" course, but simply to share his enthusiasm with anyone who dreams of becoming a writer. But that is not all. In a friendly and almost intimate way he shows you the nastiest pitfalls of the craft: adjectives, passive sentences, dialogue, grammar, etc... Then he shows you his opinions on plotting, `colourful' language, the theme of a story and much more. The list of topics he is willing to address is far from complete, but he certainly covers all the things he thinks are of importance (or the topics of which he has something interesting to say, that is...).<br />This book is inspiring and enriching for everybody who has at some point tried to write a story (or even a novel). After reading this book you just cannot stop the urge to take some paper and start writing. If you ever need to pump-up your motivation to write, read this book! You will not be disappointed. And never forget: \\"If you don't have time to read, you don't have time to write.\\"<br />As an extra bonus you get the complete story behind Stephen King's live threatening accident in midyear of 1999, when he was run down by a blue van. This book was serialized in the New Yorker.
6305718954|5.0|I think the problem Stigmata had when it was released was the marketing. They made the movie look like it was a modern day Exorcist, which it isn't. It is a story about faith, with stupendous performances by Gabriel Byrne (this man is amazing, and so expressive without ever saying a word or going over the top), Patricia Arquette, Rade Serbedzija and Jonathan Pryce (who gives a chilling performance). Rupert Wainwright does a great job directing this religious drama/thriller. His choice of camera angles and moves, as well as the special processing ('skip bleaching') of the film stock help add to the surrealness of the film. Rounding it out is an amazing score by three different artists--Billy Corgan (of the Smashing Pumpkins), Mike Garson (a world renouned pianist), and film composer Elia Cmiral. Together these artists have created a strong film. <br />The dvd contains a commentary track from the director, deleted scenes, Natalie Imbruglia's vidoe for \\"Identify\\", which Corgan and Garson wrote (and the video is filmed in an interesting way--it is worth watching, regardless of how you feel about the song). And the capstone is the alternate ending, one, in my opinion, they should have used. It's a solid dvd.
B00006LFGD|4.0|I think any CD that Barbara puts out there is music to the ears!  Music today does not have any quality to it.  This is not the case with Barbara Streisand.   I think that she ought to be commended.  There are 19 tracks on this CD and it is well worth the money!!
6305372411|5.0|These riveting words opens each episode of this fantastic series.<BR><br />In 1957 Russia Launched Sputnik then launched a man into space. The race was on. Each episode tells of the planiing an effort that went into the space program. There was one goal and that was to put a man on the moon before the Russians. Tom Hanks opens each episode with some background about the episode. The first six episodes tell of the efforts that led to the Apollo 11 landing. The first episode dealt with the Mercury and Gemini program. Episode 2 dealt with the Apollo 1 tragedy. The epidode on 1968 dealt with the turbulent social packground as well as the space program. On Christmas 1968 Apollo 8 became the first ship that orbited the moon. As one lady wrote \\"You have saved 1968\\". Spider tells the story of the developing the lunar module. Mare Tranquilitatis (Sea of Tranquility) tells the story of Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon. Episodes 7-12 deals with rest of the apollo program to Apollo 17. This includes the near distaster of Apollo 13. This episode dealt with what was hapenning on earth during the Apollo 13 flight. The Original Wives Club (Episode 11) tells the story of the wives of the astronauts. This series is a pure classic and greatly illustrates the human achievement that occured during the space program.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first heard this cd long ago and I fell in love with it.  Mayer has a similar voice to fellow soft rocker Dave Matthews, yet his music is very distinctive.  Every song brings a lyrically powerful melody to life.  This cd is definitley one of the best I have heard in a long time, and I am eager to see what Mayer can pull out of his bag of tricks to back this up.  If he succeeds with an excellent follow up cd, he will no longer be labeled a Dave Matthews rip off.  He will have made his own mark in the music biz...
B00005QGAT|5.0|I'm not exactly disco orientated but, damn!  This album has got some brilliant artistration, from the blocks of 'Don't Stop 'till you get enough', to the long string intro of 'She's Out of my life'.  This album is a major catalyst in breaking your moves on the dance floor.  This has got to be one of the best disco albums ever...words just can't describe it.  Although way out of my age bracket it just seems its...timeless...Michael's timeless!  We all love you Michael...<BR>and we'll never stop...
B00003CXXM|3.0|Matt Damon is a good actor but not convincingly good in this movie. The fight action sequences are ok due to speedy camera movement which could have been realistic if Matt did his own fight sequences with normal camera movement. Matt's character does not have the magnetic power to take his audiences with him to unfold the mystery behind his amnesiac past. Better CIA scripted movies are those in which stars Harrison Ford.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What can I say?  There is no way of describing the feeling I got the first time I heard this album...and trust me, they're still the same.  For an album to reach the hearts of so many music lovers all over the globe is just a phenomenon we will never experience again...and for it to have the same affect 20 years later is just...words just can't describe it.  The album came out 3 weeks before I was born, so you could say I was born singing half the songs...even my uncles met the man and Janet in London in 82...a story i wish i could tell you all, but for now, all i have to say is the bonus tracks are just a treat on a plate and this set of bonus track albums available are just a blessing for all MJ fans.  We all love you Michael...<BR>and we'll never stop...

B00005QGAX|5.0|Wow!...Is all I say when people bring up the 'Bad' album.  I was only 5 when this album came out, but my GOD, what an album!  Certain individuals tend to oversee the 'Bad' album, due to comparisons with 'Thriller', which i think is foolish!  You don't buy 'Bad' to compare and write notes, you buy it to listen to it!  I think they are both in worlds of their own, but 'Bad' is just...i just get goose bumps thinkin about it!  Michael wrote 33 songs initially and cut it to what we know now as 'Bad', but there are some astonishing tracks which people have actually forgotten about, unless they're like me and listen religiously! e.g. Speed Demon, listen to the bais line that was created, a real work of art...Dirty Diana, atmospheric or what!...from the symbols to the killer guitar sequence @ the end its just outstanding.  Finally the bonus tracks on this album put a stamp on Michaels talent as a song writer with the attitude of 'Streetwalker', just listen to that, why he didn't include it?...U tell me...What an album, what a talent, what a man!...<BR>We love you Michael
0780626494|3.0|I actually plunked down the cold, hard cash for this DVD before I had even seen it, based on the generally favorable reviews. Although there were a few good laughs, the time between their delivery was substantial. Twenty minutes could have been shaved off the running time if the story had been tightened up a bit, and a better film would have been achieved in the process. The acting was generally pretty good, with the exception of Silverstone's performance. Perhaps her character was miscast, but whatever the reason, her whining and belly-aching was a bit over the top and wore thin real fast. The similarly-themed film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, which is about modern kids transporting back to the fifties, is a much better movie than this.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What can I say?  There is no way of describing the feeling I got the first time I heard this album...and trust me, they're still the same.  For an album to reach the hearts of so many music lovers all over the globe is just a phenomenon we will never experience again...and for it to have the same affect 20 years later is just...words just can't describe it.  The album came out 3 weeks before I was born, so you could say I was born singing half the songs...even my uncles met the man and Janet in London in 82...a story i wish i could tell you all, but for now, all i have to say is the bonus tracks are just a treat on a plate and this set of bonus track albums available are just a blessing for all MJ fans.  We all love you Michael...<BR>and we'll never stop...
B00007KWHP|4.0|Probably the best thing about the new edition of Fragile is the beautiful new packaging. The liner notes include many more photos and a hagiographic but interesting essay. Presumably the new packaging is supposed to recreate the original LP edition (which I don't own, so I can't comment on).<br />The bonus tracks: America is a fantastic song that I've never heard before buying this album. The \\"early rough mix\\" of Roundabout is a curio at best, and it doesn't sound much different than the final version. I think they should've put the single edit version of Roundabout on here instead.<br />Another good thing is that the \\"footsteps\\" at the beginning of South Side Of The Sky have been edited to instead be at the end of We Have Heaven. SSOTS is one of my favorite Yes songs and those footsteps annoyed me.<br />If you don't own Fragile on CD already, buy this edition immediately. If you already own the original CD release, I guess it depends on whether you're a big enough Yes fan to pay for new packaging and 1 1/2 additional songs.
B00006879E|5.0|Truthfully, I actually haven't sat and listened to this album, aside from the clips on this website. However, I saw them live in Hartford, CT last week and their kick-butt performance sent me searching for an album of a group that I had never even heard of before that night, and inspired me to spread the word! The concert: It was an intimate local radio station sponsored concert with an oh-so-nice price of $5. Maroon 5 played 3rd in a line up of 5 bands that were lame-o in comparison. Their set was an energy driven, fun, funky set of music that had me dancing and singing along. They have their own amazing individualistic sound that just puts you in this great mood. Their sound is similar to that of Train, but they definitely stand out on their own. Also, they closed their set with an unbelievable rendition of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Closer\\" that had the crowd roaring and singing... well screaming along... in shock, surprise, and utter delight! I can't wait to hear more about this great new band! (review from a 23/F/CT-USA)
B00006SFBD|4.0|Ok since I'm a HUGE Opeth fan and simply adore all their work, most of all the untoppable masterpiece Still Life...heres what I think of Deliverance, their latest effort. <br />Deliverance is a great album, I like it.  The production is much dryer this time around then previous albums, less layered and lush.  One reason why I decided not to give Deliverance a five star rating is that the guitars sound a little too thin to me, and also maybe I'm imagining things but sometimes the bands playing sounds uninspired.  Not the riffs or material itself, it just feels like the playing itself lacks the passion or energy I expect from Opeth...hard to explain...<br />Now onto the good stuff.  This album is PACKED with fine fine Opeth riffery.  Wreath, the first song, was the first song I heard, and I admit from first impressions I found it VERY disappointing.  It just sounded not like MY Opeth, it sounded like some other cheapo death metal band.  On first listen anyways.  A few weeks later its my absolute FAVOURITE Opeth song, I listen to it three times as much as the other songs, its so fierce and passionate, and to me feels so powerful...awesome riffs as well and some of Opeth's best lyrics. (\\"Animals burning in a field of fire\\" - always brings a smile to my face :)<br />The title track, well, I never really liked it very much, its actually, not counting the instrumental, my least favourite song.  Its still good, I just think it has the dullest riffs and just doesn't seem to get to me like the other songs do, except that last riff which I love!<br />A Fair Judgement is a GREAT track, it feels very personal and intimate, and emotional.  It has a few twists and turns, and Mikael's clean voice is as strong as ever...brilliant.  That last sludgey doomy riff is awesome as well, not the type of riff I expect from Opeth and thats why I love it.<br />The instrumental is very soothing and lovely, nuff said.<br />Master's Apprentices - wow!  This is my second favourite track, I quite enjoy that first riff.  I don't really listen to Morbid Angel (all I have is Domination) so I can't compare it to that.  All I know is its good.  The song has great riffs throughout and the acoustic midsection is THE best on the album.  A brutally brilliant track.<br />By the Pain I See In Other's shows us a slightly more experimental side to Opeth, and it is my favourite track on Deliverance.  In my opinion, this is the type of new direction that Opeth should seek.  If they choose to tone down acoustics in the future (and they seem to be doing so already), then a larger dose of 70s prog influence, added with their brutal style could make some amazing music.  BTPISIO's has great riffs throughout, and growls over acoustic guitars!  Unheard of for Opeth!  The 'carnival' midsection is sheer brilliance and I hope in the future that kind of stuff is more prominant.<br />So, overall, I feel that the production is slightly disappointing.  Only in that the guitars sound slightly too thin to my ears, but I would say that this type of dryer production does suit the heavier style...only if the guitars had a bit more 'heft'.  Besides that, the material is simply exceptionally great stuff throughout the entire album, almost.  Those people that are whining about Opeth's change in style should know they must change.  BWP was great, but in my opinion slightly dull and predictable.  I DID NOT expect this type of stuff from Opeth, yes less complex, but at the same time, more enjoyable.<br />Great album with a few flaws.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|...it's still a good album. I purchased it because I heard \\"All the Things She Said\\" for the first time on the radio the other day, and for the rest of the day, it kept \\"running through my head\\". I decided I liked the song - a lot - so I had to get the CD. So I did, and while I wasn't disappointed, it still wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be. One reviewer said that \\"it sounds like mice being tortured\\", and they weren't all that far from the truth. Although, I would have said they sound more like Alvin and the Chipmunks on some occasions (especially in \\"Malchik Gay\\"). On other occasions, they sound like Britney Spears. That is not to say that their voices are bad; it's just in some songs they're a little hard to take. The best songs on the CD are, of course \\"All the Things She Said\\", and \\"Show Me Love\\", which plays best when at a higher volume. Most of the songs would play great at a dance club, and they've got nice bass. \\"How Soon is Now\\" is a remake of a song by the Smiths, later remade by Love Spit Love in 1995. While t.a.T.u's version isn't bad, it isn't as good as the other two versions.<br />While I think their debut American CD could have been a little better, I still like it, and I'm sure it will be spending a lot of time in my CD player. In the meantime, I spend all day humming that one song, thinking about how catchy it is. If an artist can achieve that, then I guess they must be doing something right.
B0000399WI|5.0|I don't want to say too much about this film because it says all it has to in the watching of the film. You cannot explain to someone who hasn't seen the film just HOW good it really is, it is indescribable!. I bet those who have seen it and love it as much as i do cannot name a better film, it is THAT good.<BR>This film is a truely classic film, and a case of a film being released in a lowish profile, in the shadow of Evita (can you believe it!) and gaining a snowboard effect in the fact that everyone recommended it to their friends and so on!. Even today it is still on the best sellers lists and has been voted in the top three films of ALL time many times. For me i have yet to see a better film and i doubt i EVER will. <BR>Tim Robbins is so good in the role of Andy, and as for Morgan Freeman, you could not have picked a better actor to play that role.<BR>Those of us that LOVE this film dearly should also love &quot;The Green Mile&quot;. It is the same Writer/Director combo, and while not as good a film as Shawshank, is still a classic in its own right.<BR>I will sign off now saying how unjust the film industry was  to NOT award any Oscars to this film, in my oppinion it should have swept the board in all categories and Evita should have had NOTHING!!

0399226907|5.0|This book goes through the days of the week, telling you what the hungry caterpillar ate each day. Each day he eates one more item than the day before, and it has pictures of what he ate with holes punched in little caterpillar sized bites, which my daughter found extra intriguing. It's perfect for learning numbers and names of foods with real young children, and days of the week when they're slightly older. Also, there's very few words on each page, so it held my daughters attention even when she was only a few months old. It's a board book too, so it's still sturdy after two years.

B000002KDS|4.0|The confidence that became evident on \\"Love It To Death\\" flourished on \\"Killer,\\" with the band's live antics stretching out into some jamming rock. The turf explored on tracks like \\"Black Juju\\" laid the groundwork for the strange storytelling of \\"Halo Of Flies\\" and the title cut, bringing the band's outraging stage show to LP.<br />Not that these guys were in any danger of becoming the Grateful Dead. Those exploding riffs that kick off \\"Under My Wheels\\" caught the power and majesty of The Who and \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" was enough to launch punks and posers like the Sex Pistols and Axl Rose decades later. This was the last Alice Cooper album to really be a strictly Rock record, by the following year, he'd be moving on to \\"West Side Story\\" and too much budweiser.<br />Yes it was recorded in 1971 and this was a cassette that I had to hide from my parents. (\\"Dead Babies\\" was most certainly NOT in my Mother's hit parade.) But Damn if 30 years down the road \\"Killer\\" can still raise hairs on the unsuspecting.
B0000024ZC|3.0|This release suffers greatly from a muddy/muffled production value [much like &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; by Genesis from the same year], but still manages to have its moments.  The first track, &quot;Prologue&quot; is the best, in my view.  Other tracks are much less melodic -- something that would be much stronger on the group's next release, &quot;Octopus.&quot;
B00005Y7OJ|3.0|\\"Bilingual\\" came under a lot of horn blowing and banner waving.<br />But how could they top a \\"Very\\" amazing record? The answer was, they could not. And having Atlantic records sign PSB after their much ballyhooed \\"Gay Marketing Division\\" probably set the banner far too high. It also came out after Neil Tennant's final open admittance to his sexuality. The \\"Community\\" had their new heroes and were going to squint down the microscope pretty damn hard when the CD came out.<br />\\"Bilingual\\" is not without its highpoints. The first three tracks hinted at a classic to be, but the attempts at Spanish musical thematics start wearing heavy by \\"Se a vida e\\" and it becomes a struggle to hold one's attention afterwards. Not only that, but after the musically soaring \\"Very,\\" \\"Bilingual\\" comes off as tunefully flat and unispired.<br />Thank God for the lyrics, which have always been the PSB's strong suit. They keep \\"Bilingual\\" from falling below three stars. It is just, that from a band who I would rate 4 or 5 stars on the majority of their library, average is a disapointment.
0312305060|5.0|\\"Special\\" is not the word to use for readers who might enjoy this novel, \\"specialized\\" is better, for we must never embrace elitism--snobs being bad, humility good. Thus I think a person must be a \\"specialized\\" reader who enjoys writing itself, even if it sits alone, to delight in \\"The Hours.\\" This novel is best enjoyed in small chunks independently devoured. Certain readers--and that's fine with me--do not like that sort of meal.<br />I think the same premise is what makes Virginia Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" such a great novel for some, including me, and disliked by others. But I have never been excited the same way about Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" a novel written more or less with a similar style. Chunks, chunks, chunks. In fact, I have never been able to complete \\"Ulysses.\\" This demonstrates that art is communication and a connection may or not be made at any given moment. But \\"The Hours\\" connected with me.<br />As for complaints that the novel's ending is implausible, I say thank God for that. It is art, a story, a fiction, a creation, a matter of Cunningham's imagination, and then of the reader's reimagination. What should Cunningham have done, woven his tale into a mundane set of matter-of-fact conclusions just so his critics might call it realistic and plausible? A writer of fiction chooses such \\"implausible\\" connections on purpose, for that's what makes a story.<br />Because of its many wonderful chunks I give \\"The Hours\\" five stars.<br />Further, thank God for my powers of reimagination, for I can change certain orientations within the plot of \\"The Hours\\" to suit my own orientation.<br />-----Joseph A. Psarto,

B00005JKZT|4.0|If you're a Tolkien purist, with little appreciation or understanding for what it takes to screenplay a complicated book, and bring it to life, you won't like this movie.  To follow the books, line for line, nuance for nuance, would make for 3-20 hr episodes, that would bore an Ent to death.  As it was, it bordered on being a bit of commercial travel guide for New Zealand, but you had to admit, if you were looking for Middle Earth, they found it and brought it to life, scene after scene.  Could have spent a bit more time with some of the sub rather than Frodo and Sam, who were not prominent in the second book, but the confrontation at Helms Deep and the revenge on Saurman's Tower more than made up for it.<BR>This will be more for keeping J.R.R, Tolkien alive in literature, as any has done for it author.
B00006LLNU|2.0|So now then. I have bought this CD and tried to prepare myself for an intake of &quot;sheer beauty&quot;, for &quot;stunning, mesmerizing soundscapes&quot;, yet what I have found is dull, boring, and, yes, quite unimaginative. No, leaving tracks without titles and smacking a pseudo-conceptual packaging on top do not add up to a work of art. Nor do they manage the impossible here - covering up pointless meandering for minutes and minutes on end, only to culminate in several moments of slightly greater intensity. There isn't really much space for emotion here; whatever stirring an initially intriguing beginning may provoke is inevitably swamped out by stubborn repetitiveness that adds absolutely nothing. In a perverse way, then, that tracks are anonymous captures quite aptly how faceless and characterless they are - who would bother remembering their titles anyway. It is interesting that all praise for this album points to Iceland as an inspiration for this music and indulges in descriptions of Icelandic oddly beautiful landscapes as a certain tangible equivalent of Sigur Ros' musicianship. All this may be true; only what difference does it make? How does it enrich otherwise flat music? <BR>If you genuinely seek music of cinematic, meditative quality, music for music's sake, where talent asserts itself without outside assistance, where imagination and ingenuity are awe-inspiring, try forthcoming &quot;100th Window&quot; by Massive Attack or &quot;Lazer Guided Melodies&quot; by Spiritualized.<br />And for ( ), destination is Ebay.com.

B00006F83Y|4.0|When we last heard from Queens of the Stone Age, they were enthusing about a plethora of illicit drugs in \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer,\\" the opening track from 2000's raucous and indulgent Rated R. While critics placed the album just below Nirvana's Nevermind on the \\"important to rock-n-roll\\" list, the band still had to play against the grain of the jock-rock, rap-metal bands that once roamed the airwaves. Two years later, while \\"nu metal\\" and rap-rock have slipped into a catatonic state, Queens of the Stone Age have survived the trends (and their hangovers) and established themselves as the rock band to watch this year. Their latest album, Songs for the Deaf, released in June, takes as many dark and harrowing turns as a high-speed drive through the mountains at 3 a.m.<BR>QOTSA is primarily a two-man outfit: Guitarist and vocalist Josh Homme, and bassist Nick Oliveri, both were founding members of mid-nineties acid-rock kings, Kyuss. Past Queens albums have featured a revolving set of musicians, including Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan and even Rob Halford. On Songs for the Deaf, Lanegan lends his brawny vocals to a number of tracks. But the Queens get even more star-power, from Nirvana/Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl, who mans the drum kit on all but one track. His propulsive style locks into Oliveri's greasy bass and Homme's chugging guitars on every track, and puts \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" above the legal limit for heaviness. It's his best drumming since Nirvana.<BR>Overall, it still takes a few listens to manage the band's quirky sound. In fact, the band's critics have often labeled their static riffs and Black Sabbath vibe as \\"stoner rock.\\" But QOTSA are one of the few modern bands that can and will play fast, solid and sometimes challenging rock songs. \\"It really is more of a musical experiment,\\" Homme says of his band in Guitar World magazine. \\"It keeps moving and reinventing itself. That way, we never get painted into a corner.\\"<BR>There's little chance of thathappening. Though Songs for the Deaf contains many elements of past Queens albums - from fast-paced bar-chord crunchers (\\"First it Giveth,\\" \\"Song for the Dead\\") to slightly ridiculous punk experiments (\\"Six Shooter\\", featuring Dean Ween's shredded vocal chords) - it's apparent that QOTSA have matured as a band. The album's first single, \\"No One Knows\\" features rollicking beats and tight vocal harmonies even catchier than those on Rated R. The equally significant track, \\"Go With the Flow,\\" stands out in its expressive lyrics about escaping the pains of the past. There are other moments, as in \\"Another Love Song,\\" where the band is downright melodic (gasp), a brave feat for a rock band that was making the Ozzfest circuit two summers ago. However, while many bands tend to mellow as they mature, Homme and Oliveri have not slowed down. Make no mistake that Songs for the Deaf is an album full of sober thunder.<BR>But then consider the \\"hidden track\\" (it's listed on the back cover) on Songs for the Deaf. \\"Mosquito Song\\" begins as a pensive acoustic ballad, then slowly winds it's way through baroque and Middle-Eastern influences to a finale with full string arrangements. Not exactly Ozzfest material, but, given the outsider attitude and experimental nature of the band, that's fine by them.
0553277472|2.0|Perhaps the most overrated book in pop culture.  Interesting, yes, definitely.  A treatise of philosophical merit or anything of any philosophical interest certainly not.  Reading it will only confuse and over simplify what the great thinkers such as Kant tried to achieve.  Likely this book says the most about what can happen when an intelligent person lives in a small Western college town.
B00004YA12|5.0|No, the endless rows of troops and supporters are not special effects - they're the real thing in all their terror and power.  Nothing like this can be seen in the world today except maybe in North Korea.  This movie is a priceless historical document and a study in mass psychology and propaganda.  Hopefully, it will always stay in circulation, where it best serves as a warning against the power of charismatic dictators and blind devotion to The State, and unlimited power.<br /><br />Maybe it would be best if this movie was sold back-to-back with footage and photos of the horrors produced by Nazi Germany, and hopefully end with some photos of the Red Army's vicious three-day pillage of Berlin, where soldiers were given 'liberty without restraint,' to punish the Germans in the most horrific ways, and the Soviet propaganda footage of a gigantic concrete Nazi emblem being blown to smithereens by dynamite.  That way you could see the gross effect of Hitler's spell over Germany, and the absolute horror of war - Hell on Earth.<br /><br />If you ever wondered how Hitler gained so much power, this movie will explain it to you.  A total loser and drifter for most of his young life, then-Corporal Hitler stumbled across his hidden talent as an orator when given an end-of-service assignment of preaching to troops exiting the defeated Werchmact about the dangers of communism.  His superiors immediately recognized his latent talents, and made more use of his speaking abilities.  From there he started his career in politics.  In 'Triumph,' Adolph Hitler is at his best - or worst.  Not only did Hitler have an amazing talent for public speaking, but he was a shrewd propagandist.  He once said that torchlight rallies were a favorite of his because it was easiest to bend people's will at the end of the day.  Anyone who looks at Germany and says 'that could never happen here,' is dead wrong.  All that's needed is a right ingredient mix of timing, politics, and the state of the human condition.  Then, add in a charismatic dictator, and watch the troops march and 'leftist' opposition get crushed on the road to nationalistic Armageddon.<br /><br />This movie will silence anyone who says that protest isn't patriotic.  While the leaders of any nation would pee their pants to have millions of people screaming 'heil' at each of theis 'seigs,' we now know all too well the results of blind devotion to a leader.  This movie is all the warning we need.  Watch it, at least once, so that you can recognize the traits of nationalism, and so you can gain a better sense of propaganda and rhetoric.  Too many people can't identify truth from schpiel already!<br /><br />Notice this movie doesn't show anyone countering the Nazi movement.  That's because anyone 'liberal' enough to say war is bad, would have, at the time this movie was made, found themselves wearing a piano-wire necktie.<br /><br />While it's tempting to ban this movie outright because of the horrific acts of Nazi Germany, that would be a massive mistake.  Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />-- JJ Timminsof the human condition.

This dvd records all the pops, clicks and faded images, and is it my imagination, or is the film constantly shaking?  If you like Strictly Ballroom (and it is a wonderful film), buy the other dvd version - or stick to the video.
B00005QG9J|5.0|i've been sitting online today. reading through reviews for different bands, and this is what i think. first off i'd like to know how amazon.com can manage to link incubus to weezer? someone please shed some light on that subject because it makes little sense to me. as for this cd, its absolutely brilliant. every track is different and introspective. brandon boyd is definitly one of the best singers in rock now adays. even though they have lost alot of their heavy attitude on this cd, it has been replaced with wisedom, and just an all around appeal that you wont find on any other cd out today. as for the screaming girls... and all the publicity, if you cant get over it, and respect that for once they are getting the acknowledgement that they deserve, then dont listen to them. or dont turn on mtv. they are a great band that is going to be around for a long time to come.
0446677450|4.0|Financial and personal discipline, along with boosting the reader's financial IQ, are the major themes in Rich Dad, Poor Dad.  Readers may be distracted by the relationship &quot;issues&quot; running through this otherwise excellent book.  I'm not sure if Kiyosaki is intentionally tapping into the emotional maze of the father-daughter/father-son relationship to get his financial lessons across.  These relationships are naturally fraught with misunderstandings and frustrations; not the least of which involve financial matters.  (And what if your father qualifies as both a \\"rich\\" Dad and a \\"poor\\" Dad?)  That aside, I found the lessons to be informative, practical, and motivating.  I look forward to reading others in the series.
B00006M183|4.0|I cant see the problem alot of people have with 'change' it's so annoying to find that alot of Pearl Jam fans turned their back on the band in the past because they never gave in to demand for another 'Ten'. Instead they gave us 7 great and different sounding albums, so the real fans never got bored. <br />Riot Act is a fine album, some great 'Arena' rock anthems such as 'Save you' &amp; the excellent 'Green disease' (possibly their finest song in 7 years or so)  Sure, there are a few weak tracks, as with any album, 'Cant keep' is a weak opener, I do hate when they do this, remember 'No Code' opener 'Sometimes'? I would have rathered 'Save you' as the opener, more lively, heavier, a good way to Kick start. 1/2 full is also weak in my opinion but other than those 2 there's not a bad track. Ballads come in the shape of 'Thumbing my way' ,  'I am mine' and the closing song 'All or none' .. they're not 'Black' but lovely songs nonetheless. Riot Act is a superior album to the 2 that preceded it -  'Binnaural' &amp; 'Yield' (though these were decent albums) , proving that they have Matured rather than faded away, there's alot more gems to come from this 5 piece. Roll on the B-sides &amp; rares =)
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love stripped is her best album yet. All the songs on the cd are great. When I listen to the album,I become so mesmerize by the power of her vocal skills. She's indeed on of the best singers out there, yet she's really been underappreciated by a lot people and the media because of the way she dresses. All I'm saying don't judge a book by it's cover. Christina is a great singer and just forget the fact of how she dresses and go and pick her album it's amazing you won't regret ever buying it.Go Christina You Rock.................
B000002UDB|4.0|This soundtrack to the Beatles' bizarre and somewhat indulgent TV film of the same name is designed the same way their earlier soundtrack albums were made -- the first half of songs are from the film, with the second half made up of non-film tracks. The only difference here is that those non-film songs were all released as 45RPM singles at the time. And in England, the film songs were actually released on an EP, not a full-length album. So technically this disc is one long single, sort of a 'best of 1967' for the band. <BR>Even though the songs are even more heavily influenced by psychedelia, the band still keep things accessible; their attention to songcraft and penning singles is still there. Tracks like Magical Mystery Tour, I Am the Walrus, Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields Forever, All You Need Is Love, and Fool On the Hill, are all classics. The only weak spots are the instrumental (Flying) which sounds somewhat underdeveloped, and Blue Jay Way, which meanders a bit at the end. All in all, a good album for the band. The film itself may have been hard to swallow, but this album goes down quite well.

0312305060|4.0|\\"The Hours\\" by Michael Cunningham is an elegantly written, artful book. But the artistry is pleasant and doesn't often feel strained. I read this book because I've been hearing wonderful things about the movie (and the previews look so goood!), but that movie is not likely to ever come to Aberdeen.<br />The book focuses on a single day in the lives of three women living at different times, Virginia Woolf, in a fictionalized account of a day in the 1920s when she is writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway;\\" Laura Brown, a depressive suburban housewife in Los Angeles in the 1950s who is reading \\"Mrs. Dalloway;\\" and Clarissa Vaughn, nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by her longtime friend for whom she is giving a party that night. This last takes place in the 1990s in Greenwich Village.<br />Cunningham moves very smoothly among the women's lives, and the similarities in their thoughts and reactions that he writes of here are beautifully subtle and somewhat rhythmic. (I understand, too, that there are small allusions to the original \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" novel in some plot points, particularly for Clarissa, but I haven't read that book yet.) The day progresses through the 224-page book with the three women in tandem. Other characters play important parts, Virginia Woolf's husband and her sister's family, Clarissa's friend Richard, for whom she is giving the party and who is dying of AIDS, Clarissa's partner, Sally, and Laura Brown's son and neighbor, Kitty.<br />The women are linked in a somewhat surprising way at the end, which helps drive the novel; you rather sense that there's something making them be involved with each other, even \\"through time.\\" But the plot isn't really what kept me reading. (And a major plot point at the end disappointed me-it seemed to me to divert the focus from the characters the novel has been focusing on throughout the book. It just rang false against what Cunningham had already set up.)<br />The way that the author describes the mental lives of these women, particularly Laura Brown, was fascinating to me. Often the women think to themselves, \\"this is enough. Sometimes it is just enough\\" and seem wonderfully satiated with the small beauties of life. But for Laura, there is an oppressiveness about the contentment that drains you as a reader, but is very rich. This oppressiveness seems odd on the surface for women who are very fortunate by most typical measures. Laura's friend Kitty could be dying of cancer. Clarissa's friend IS dying of AIDS. Virginia has enough money to focus on her writing.<br />\\"I am alone, Virginia thinks, as the man and woman continue up the hill and she continues down. She is, of course, not alone, not in a way anyone else would recognize, and yet at this moment, walking through the wind toward the lights of the Quadrant, she can feel the old devil... and she knows she will be utterly alone if and when the devil chooses to appear again.\\"<br />I found Cunningham's portrayal of the emotional lives of these women to be incredibly perceptive, and, though dark, compelling. He describes well the ways that they are overwhelmed by too many emotional responses and the processing and sorting of those feelings. Even though I had some quibbles with the end, I loved the novel and recommend it.Laura Brown, was fascinating to me. Often the women think to themselves, \\"this is enough.

0451196716|5.0|This book is horrible... horrible.  and it was one of the best books I've ever read.  I am stunned.  I read it in 2 sittings...  A few pages in I knew this book was special, I read it for 5 hours into the night, then forced myself stop.  The Long Walk was the theme of my disturbed thoughts as I drifted in and out of confused sleep.  A few times I woke up thinking \\"keep going\\" first and wondering where I was second.  I can not say enough about it; it will consume my thoughts for days.<br />Not much of a review, but then reading it has left me exhausted like I was there.  King is a genius.  Yet he is popular for all the wrong reasons.  Amazing... I have some thinking to do.  Don't read the reviews or the synopsis, just go directly to page one.
1586210912|1.0|Kiyosaki has managed to combine everything written on success, wealth, strategy and business - whether bad or good - into the greatest MLM empire since Tom Vu's. Buy the Millionaire Mind or The Milionaire Next Door if you want real insight on the wealthy.<br />- In one breath he's a married millionaire buying Porche's and Mercedes' from excess money, then two minutes later he's broke and borrowing $2,000 from a friend at 10% for 90 days for the down payment on a $20,000 foreclosure. He then resales the property in a few hours for $60,000. If he was so wealthy in real estate, any bank would hand him an unsecured $2000 _instanlty_ based on assets or FICO.<br />- He also buys stocks on tips, and then sells after they go up in a week. Like everyone in the late 90's, he believes in speculation and high risk games. In my opinion, his stories actually tell of unmanaged risk and what he _thinks_ is the road to riches. This is converse to becoming, and STAYING, financially wealthy. Ok, I bought his CD set, so his plan is working ... <br />Credibility statement: I grew up a poor minority in South Central Los Angeles, have a state college BS degree, 8 properties, and have both poor and deca-millioniare friends and family. I know garbage when I hear it ...
0312305060|5.0|I don't know how well this books stands alone--I hadn't read Mrs. Dalloway but in a class I had to see the movie, so I had working knowledge of the plot.<br />That being said, this novel was a beautiful continuation and extension of Mrs. Dalloway and Virginia Woolf's life.  For all its mystique as a Pulitzer Prize Winner and its erudite content, this work is not inaccessible and terribly high-minded.  The characters are heart-wrenchingly true to life and Cunningham does not take liberty with Woolf's life.  Instead, the true love he has for her work shows through; yet, this story is very much his own.  <br />I haven't read a book like this before, where the love of the subject matter shines through so vibrantly, where the prose is natural and takes on a different life for each character, where the hours in a day are treated as though they are more valuable than gold, where a man inhabits a woman's mind without prentension or falsification.<br />Don't be scared of the subject matter.  This novel is a treasure, an amazing examination of how we live our lives.
B000000ITJ|5.0|I have problems deciding whether this is my favourite album or Equinoxe (also by Jarre) is. This without doubt has the most 'sad' (depressing) songs on any of his CDs. BUT, they are done so well that you ignore this factor, and instead concentrate on just how good they are. In my opinion, the 'sad' songs are JM Jarre's biggest talent.
B000069CWE|5.0|Everyone I know that has listened to this CD said that this one is much better than the original CD you don't get bored of it.
B000007R1M|4.0|Now I remember! Before I bought this I went on Cdnow, in the good old days when you could actually listen to all the songs. I was deciding whether to buy this. My teacher told me about them, next day saw something about them in the newspaper, and said why not. I listened to the song spacelab, and I knew I had to get the CD. It's influenced me to be more minimalist, like a song I composed called \\"Introduction - Kulture\\". I will not give this song 5, because the last track \\"the man machine\\" is really annoying and its too long.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is a beautifully written and poignant novel about a young girl named Scout and her childhood experiences with racism, discrimination, and corruption.  All of Scout's experiences are laced with an underlying theme, \\"killing a mockingbird.\\"  The author uses this phrase to symbolize harming the innocent, hurting something that is only there to make your life sweeter.  This theme often appears, but the book is not at all repetetive.  The first few chapters drag a bit, but after that the book is absolutely captivating.  I recommend this book to everyone 13 and over, as it does address some mature issues.
B00007E8V4|5.0|this is the best SOAD album there is it has a lot better guitar rifs and a more tight sound. now dont get me wrong toxicity was awesome and has more memorable songs such as chop suey or toxicity. but this cd can be explained in three words CHIC N STU.! which is the best song ever! <BR>1. chic and stu listen to it and itll get stuck in your head. 10/10<BR>2. innervision- their hit single is actually the worst song on this cd good though 7/10<BR>3. bubbles- jsut plain great - 9/10<BR>4. boom!- not as good as POD's version of boom but awesome 8/20<BR>5. nuguns - another great addition 8/10<BR>6. add - its one of the only songs on this cd that says F*** neat though 7/10<BR>7. mr. jack - not the best 6/10<BR>8.

Talk about your bad (as in zero) value.  Isn't the oft repeated theme in L &amp; S &quot;family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten&quot;?  That's the one thing my kid remembers most about this film, and excuse me for saying that I don't really have a problem with that.  If YOU do, don't fret...Barney is on PBS Mon.-Fri.
B00005QATY|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised at this movie, especially the fact that George Clooney can sing.  I got a kick out of the song he sang with \\"The Soggy Bottom Boys\\".  Clooney has such a wide range of talent.<br />Unlike his recent release, the remake of the 1972 classic \\"Solaris\\" was a lot more intense, but very good.  \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" is lighter and less taxing drama-wise.  This by no means makes any of these movies any less enjoyable.<br />For one thing, Clooney's character is not without flaws.  He lies, cheats, and steals to get what he wants. Also, he loves to grease his hair.  It's not until his ex-wife decides to marry another man that he discovers what is really important.  In spite of his rather charming nature he still manages to be fooled by a shapely body feeding him moonshine in scantily clad, wet clothing while she harmonizes with two others of the same body type.<br />The amazing thing about Clooney's character is he mamages to stay a few leagues ahead of the athorities.  Even when things look bleak, he manages to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.<br />I highly recommend this movie for those that want a good laugh.
B000066AXC|4.0|This movie is an excellent movie, well written and directed and Russell Crowe's acting is outstanding.  Unfortunately, Mr. Howard's vision of John Nash's delusion is way off base and pure hype to increase the entertainment value of the movie.  It's still worth watching, but I'd recommend the book if you want to get a more complete perspective.
B00003CXXM|1.0|If you are a fan of the book, This is not it.<BR>While a few, very few, plot points have been kept character names and title is all that is left from the excellent book.  Not even one of the main plot points, not to mention character, has been kept.  <br />This is a first rate example of artistic license run amok.  While it is a good movie it needs to have it's name changed to &quot;The Re-Bourne Identity&quot;.  <br />All they did was use the Title of a best selling book to sell a movie.<br />I give it 1 stars as an action movie.  No stars are awarded for screen adaptation of the book.  If this was not a blatant attempt to sell a movie based on title recognition it would have more stars.  Hollywood needs to have more respect for the public not to mention the author.  Artistic license must have it's limits.
B00005JLS0|2.0|If neither Sandra Bullock nor Hugh Grant (to a lesser extent) can save the thinnest and most damningly simple movie, then it's safe to say that it is indeed junked. Unlike one of the other Mark Lawrence movies featuring Bullock, 'Miss Congeniality,' Bullock doesn't get much of a chance to show off her screwball splendor. Instead, what we get from both leads is a tired effort at replaying what movie audiences love most about them, which is one joke too many and one too lame already. But, if all else fails in a screwball romance, you can at least be assured of eye candy with this pair.

I admire her courage in sharing her tale.<br />Sebold is eleoquent, and shares the raw details in a way that disturbs, but does not alienate the reader.  I give this book a 4 stars out of 5, as I was truly entranced by her story.  <br />&quot;Lucky&quot; allows the reader to look into Sebold, and also better explains her characterizations in &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;.

B00006LSM3|4.0|I had never heard any of Harrison's solo work till I brought this, and truthfully i diddnt expect to much. But this is a really good album woth the songs having a soft, country kind of rock to them. The songs here are actually much better then what he wrote when he was with The Beatles. I think the highlights are \\"Brainwashed\\" \\"Any Road\\" and \\"Rising Sun\\", the former more of a rock sonh with the later 2 having a country feeling to them.
B00006RIO7|3.0|All I have to say is these are awesome songs. But one thing got to me.  In the Cell Tango song they say something false about Mormons.

It gets on my nerves.  Leave us alone!
1587990717|5.0|Almost all readers fail to see that Taleb's exercise is a personal essay/memoir not a catalogue/textbook (he discusses matters casually and does not quote reference papers). But it is his points that are misunderstood. Point 1 is that mathematical models of randomness inspired from physics do not work in the social sciences (he advocates a Popperian/Humean form of asymmetric skepticism). Point 2 is that we are not made to behave in rational manner in the front of randomness EVEN WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THE MATHEMATICS. <BR>Taleb uses himself as Ginea pig with dramatic honesty at times. The style is deceptive: the book goes very deep and is linked to the modern cognitive literature (Pinker/Girgerenzer/Ledoux/Damasio/E.O. Wilson...) although not many sources are quoted.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|Throughout the '90s, many music snobs had claimed that classic heavy metal was officially dead - and Iron Maiden were one of the bands that was always mentioned in those remarks.  Who could blame them?  The band was putting out mediocre material in the wake of Bruce Dickinson's departure, and most of the so-called &quot;metal&quot; that was being released around that time was watered-down, poser, commercial nonsense.  However, in 1999, Dickinson decided to rejoin Maiden after a six-year absence, and guitarist Adrian Smith (who played on two of Bruce's solo albums)came along for the ride as well.  With the revamped line-up, which now included three guitar players (Smith, along with Dave Murray and the ever underrated Janick Gers), the new 21st century Maiden went on a short reunion tour and headed to the studio afterwards.<br />The result is the aptly titled BRAVE NEW WORLD, an album that brought good ol' classic, melodic, epic, no-holds-barred heavy metal back to the masses.  While the band's trademark galloping sound is as fearsome as ever, this is also the band's most experimental release to date, and the most complex since SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON.  You would think that with three guitarists in the band it would be a disaster, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.  You get the best of all worlds on here.  From the heavy punch of Murray, to the melodic instinct of Smith, and to the technical flash of Gers, all three players get the job done.  Steve Harris' rapid-fire bass playing is just as sharp as ever, and Nicko pounds the skins like a madman while also showing that his playing has matured since he first joined the band back in 1983.  The real standout, however, is Bruce himself.  He sounds better than ever on this release.  This is definitely his crowning achievement as a vocalist, combining the rougher style of his solo albums with the classic &quot;Air Raid Siren&quot; style of Maiden's golden era.  A tour de force performance.<br />With 10 songstopping 67 minutes, there is not a wasted track on here, making this Maiden's most consistent album ever.  &quot;The Wicker Man,&quot; &quot;The Mercenary,&quot; and &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot; are pounding riff-heavy rockers in the IM tradition.  Short, fast, and to the point with awesome choruses.  Both the title track and &quot;The Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; show that Maiden is maturing and that heavy rock can be emotional if done right.  &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; is the most unique thing they've done.  It's mostly bass and keyboard-heavy, with stunning orchestrations and great solos to complement the arrangement.  &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; is a masterpiece and probably the band's best epic.  It's mostly slow, but stay with it - it's that good.  Bruce's vocals are incredible, the chorus is so powerful, the lyrics are brilliant, and the escalating musicianship (leading to a furious time change around the 5:47 mark) is nerve-wracking.  Nine minutes never went by so fast.<br />I think I've said enough.  This is just an amazing accomplishment from a band that proved it still has staying power.  Maiden is in the studio now recording their new album which should be out in this summer.  If it's anywhere near as good as BRAVE NEW WORLD, the music world is safely secure.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I'm 29 years old, and came to this country from Russia in 1979.<br />I'm glad to see the cross artist relations through music today.  In the past, Russia was not that much part of the &quot;Cross-reference&quot; music boom, such as in the early days when Frank, Tom, Englebert, Dean, Tony and others were singing the same crooner and international hits, like Besame Mucho and Dicitencello Vuie in English.  New Russian stars like Phillip Kirkorov and T.A.T.U are leading the way to a new world and I salute them for it.  With T.A.T.U, I do not see any &quot;Marketing-Ploy&quot; at all, to say so would be too shalow.  It's just plain FUN!.  Why can't we all just enjoy the music without any prapoganda paranoia.  Come on guys! It's 2003 for crying out loud.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Degustibus et coloribus non est disputandum, but the people who are giving this album 1-star ratings are obviously either a) deaf, b) insane or c) a combination of both. While it is certainly chic to bash the latest craze, every once in a blue moon there is a hype that is everything it's cracked up to be. As much as Norah would probably object to being called a hype, she is one of the few who can live up to that ignomous billing.<br />A lot of complaints seem to stem from a misunderstanding of this album. People have heard that Norah is 'the next big thing' and they go out and buy this, expecting some golden-voiced, high-emotion technical masterwork. Instead, they get an album that is so subtly understated that it has that rare quality of growing on you as you listen to it. Be gentle with these songs, don't dismiss them if they don't grab you at first... their style is more that of a gentle, constant tugging then the rollercoaster rides that the music industry so commonly tries to shove down our throats nowadays.<br />For me, the hardest thing to believe when listening to this album is that Norah is only 22. There's no other young artist out there with anywhere near the same potential. The mere fact that people feel to need to compare her to aging legends (and claim the latter are still better - usually rightly so), speaks volumes about the heights she has achieved at this young age.<br />If you buy any album at all this year, make it this one. Just keep your expectations in check. This is truly gold (which, incidentally, is the title of a great album by one of Norah's favourite artists : Ryan Adams), but don't go and expect to stumble into Fort Knox.

This is truly gold (which, incidentally, is the title of a great album by one of Norah's favourite artists : Ryan Adams), but don't go and expect to stumble into Fort Knox.
B000002LQR|5.0|This album is simply a masterpiece.  From the great emotions you feel from listening to \\"Under the Bridge\\" to the funk that makes you wanna dance in songs like \\"Funky Monks\\" and \\"Suck My Kiss\\".  The Chili's have a style like no other combining funk, rap, and rock and really get that all acrossed in songs like \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Power of Equality\\".  I would recommend this album to anyone that is persuing the greastest album collection they can get and I am privileged to have this one in my collection.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This movies is a very good movie, dispite all those bad reviews.  A very good and funny mystery movie.
B000066NW0|5.0|I enjoyed the &quot;Let Go&quot; album alot. The sound and lyrics were captivating and easy to get into. Someone writing their own songs also puts a little more meaning into what your listening to. However, instead of just taking music and song for what it is people turn it into a genre issue. WHO CARES if someone said Avril is punk and shes more pop, rock or country for that matter. She's just someone who wrote some good tunes that alot of people happen to enjoy. So to everyone that buys CD's according to what their buddies think or dress like - good for you. For all those that just want to listen to something pretty good &quot;Let Go&quot; makes the grade.
B000065U1N|5.0|After reading the other reviews on this movie, I'm amazed. Some people gave it one star for the dumbest reasons. Some people say it's racist cause it portrays \\"black\\" people as the villains. Well, news flash: people that live in Somalia just happen to have that color skin, and since the movie is a true story, the \\"villians\\" in the movie do too. No reason they should have changed it to appease the whiny politically-correct snots. Others claim it was too violent. Another news flash: war does tend to be that way. I'm not sure what these people were expecting...Winnie the Pooh?<br />Many of the movie's detractors apply the demeaning title of \\"war porn.\\"  This is a ridiculous and juvenile concept which demonstrates the narrow minds of those who use the term.  We don't refer to \\"Trauma: Life in the E.R.\\" as medical porn, do we?  \\"C.S.I.\\" is not science porn, is it?  So why should a true story such as Black Hawk Down have such a derogatory title attached to it?  Some people will be turned off by all the blood and killing, BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN OCTOBER 1993!  If you don't like that sort of thing, don't watch a movie about war!  This seems to me to be common sense, but judging from some of the one-star reviews, not everyone is gifted with common sense.<br />As far as doing what it set out to do, which is relate the horrible predicament of Army soldiers behind enemy lines in Somalia, the movie is unparalleled. Mark Bowden's book is brimming with detail, most of which transfers exquisitely to the movie screen. The courage and tenacity of the Army rangers and Delta Force is remarkable, and is brought to life magnificently by all the actors, in particular Ewan McGregor. The movie is relentless, and is still the most intense movie I've ever seen. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you're looking for a perfectly accurate and breathtakingly gripping movie about the horrors of war, look no further.
0060537639|5.0|Gavin Menzies propels his readers towards a new perspective on history. East and West become much more than geographical terms. Instead, interwoven, they comprise the basic tapestry of global development.<BR> <BR>The author combines meticulous research with his extensive navigational experience to present a convincing argument that China's amazing Navy in 1421 surpassed all others. In addition, he encourages readers to discover new information on this topic, and keep in touch with him through his web page.<br />Thus, Menzies inspires everyone to consider world history as it truly is: an exciting, ever-changing, growing field of study.<br />As an historian of both Asia and America,who began life with a Chinese amah, as Menzies did, I found this book to be factually correct with reliable primary and secondary sources carefully noted.<br />Whether you agree or disagree with the author's thesis, you will find an adventure in historical discovery, which will force you to think more deeply about the influences and patterns creating the world as we know it today.

B00003W8NM|5.0|I have no problem with people disliking this movie.  Everyone has different taste.  But when people start bashing it because they think it advocates a political position that they obviously don't even understand, I get angry.  Countless reviews have called the Fight Club/Project Mayhem group in the film \\"fascist\\" or \\"skinhead\\".  Ebert, the amazon editorial review, and countless viewer reviews have made this assertion.  I find this both amusing and incredibly frustrating, because they could not possibly be more wrong in their placement of FC/PM on the political scale.  Here is a dicitonary definition of fascism:<br />fas·cism    <BR>n. <br />1.  A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism. <BR>2.  A political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government. <BR>3.  Oppressive, dictatorial control.<br />In other words, fascists are ultra-conservatives.  They believe that people cannot possibly govern themselves and require the guidance of an absolute dictator to retain order.  Since this political view is as far right on the political spectrum as you can get, ultra-conservatives are considered extremists.  This, I believe, is where the confusion lies.  FC/PM is also an extremist group, but their beliefs are on the far LEFT of the political scale.  They are anarchists, and want the complete dissolution of governmental control.  If you want to argue about the irony that the organiazation itself is run by a single absolute leader, fine.  But if you think that the overall group has fascist goals, you are an idiot.  And about the assertion that FC/PM is a \\"skinhead\\" organization, that is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  The group's members shave their heads as part of the destruction of their individuality (\\"You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake...\\"), not as a statement of racism.  If you paid any attention to the movie at all, you would notice that there are several black members in Fight Club.  That hundreds or even thousands of people have made their descision on whether or not to view this movie based on the incorrect statements of several prominent reviewers annoys me to no end. And by the way, just because there are some anarchist/extremists views expressed in this film does not mean that the writer or director actually advocate anarchy or disorder.  The movie is meant to make us look at the way we live, not to convince us of some twisted political agenda.  Read the Chuck Palahniuk novel, and this will become even more clear.<br />There is nothing in this world that pisses me off more than ignorance.<BR>And just so you don't think I'm saying that I know more than everyone else, I'm even more pissed off when that ignorance is my own.
0553381709|5.0|George R.R. Martin continues his realistic fantasy epic with the major factions still skirmishing for the crown, despite the huge battle at the end of &quot;A Clash of Kings.&quot;   Several of the meandering plot lines continue to wander ceaselessly, while others get turned completely upside down.  Tyrion's reduced political clout precludes the devious machinations that so well fit his character in &quot;Clash.&quot;  Caetlyn broods more solemnly than in &quot;Clash,&quot; and her character becomes even less active.  Arya's endless trek takes new turns yet still continues, but Sansa develops and matures as a character.  As with the first two novels, the plot line of Daenerys across the sea, though vividly detailed, still feels unconnected as she gathers power for her inevitable assault on Westeros.  Bran seems almost an afterthought, with only four chapters from his perspective and very little advancement of that plot line.  Jon follows events north of the Wall, the only new major setting that Martin develops, and Jon's plot line slowly develops but unexpectedly connects with another.  The group of point-of-view characters is augmented by two people previously viewed from other perspectives, including Jaime Lannister.  His character, the most interesting in the novel, develops from the callous, celebrated knight into yet another of Martin's intricate round characters with complex and even sympathetic motivations for their actions.  <br />The flow from chapter to chapter when covering several major events is roughly paced, as Martin quickly alternates between only two point-of-view characters in describing both the Red Wedding and the final events at Castle Black.  This shuttling effectively describes multiple sides of these events, but it pulls the focus away from other ongoing plot lines.  In contrast, the more subtle narrative coverage in the first two books related details or conclusions of important events through other characters' later discussions, rather than in quickly alternating points-of-view.<br />As with the previous two books, Martin's thorough characterization of 'real' characters and his skill with the multiple point-of-view narrative produce a brilliant installment in this extremely vast fantasy epic.
0439295750|5.0|A astounding collection of classic tales of the macabre. Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde takes up about half of the book; the remainder contains storie such as Markhiem, The Bottle Imp, and the Body Snatcher. Written in a fast paced, articulate manner, this book leaves one hanging at the edge of his seat. I hope you don't fall off.
B000002HMH|5.0|I am sick and tired of reading reviews about Load where so-called fans say that Metallica \\"sold out\\".  Why dont all of you just ... go buy eighties Metallica.  I mean, who wants to listen to the exact kind of music from the same band nine times?  I sure don't.  In fact, I like Load and Reload better than any previous work by the greatest band of all time.  Also, if you read the reviews on Amazon.com carefully, half of the reviewers that give this a bad rating can't even spell-i have seen it so many times.  Words like 'horibble' and 'soled out', and it just makes me laugh ...All four of my favorite songs by Metallica are on here, too.  Until it Sleeps, Bleeding Me, The Outlaw Torn.  Oh yeah:  anyone who thinks Load [is bad], if you have a big surround sound system, turn it way up and listen to King Nothing.  Then tell me this [is bad].
B00001OH7P|5.0|Truly the best CD that i have in my possession. Five Years is a glorious crescrendo of mastery. You can listen to it over and over again, and know all the words, and listen to it some more...still great. Soul Love has an excellent saxophone, and while not the best song on the album, it is still very cool. Moonage Daydream seems to me to be about an acid trip, and it's awesome to sing along to: &quot;I'm an alligator/I'm a momma pappa calling for you/I'm a space invader.&quot; Starman is my least favorite song on the album but it is still a fabulous song, one that will play in your head. &quot;It Ain't Easy&quot; has great lyrics &quot;It ain't easy to get to heaven/when you're going down&quot; and though some may not like it, it's one of my favorites. &quot;Lady Stardust&quot; is a very glam song, and &quot;STar&quot; is fabulous to rock out to. &quot;Hang on to yourself&quot; very fast-paced, seems like Ziggy is playing it. Then &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; very emotional and you can't help singing to the chorus, excellent song, brilliant. &quot;Suffragette city&quot; the well known rock song with mind blowing guitars and soloing and then the best song on the album &quot;Rock n roll Suicide&quot; which always makes me want to cry.
0441008356|4.0|A profusion of highly inventive ideas in the same hyperintelligent vein of Stephenson, Sterling, Egan, and Bear. Not yet as humorous as Sterling or Stephenson or as edgy as Egan and Bear, but this first novel actually has a better ending than many of these modern masters seem to be able to muster (much better than Stephenson's first outings).<br />Yes, there are some some very soft spots in the plot; yes, the choppy relativistic time frame makes it hard to develop and relate to characters, but the underlying theme and global plot development is excellent--well worth the 10 hours it may take to read. <br />If his editors and publisher give him time to refine and tweak the next plot (and solicit some smart readers to help out) then we may have a classic. I have not yet read Chasm City yet. Fingers crossed.<br />There goes a research career for a promising astrophysicist. Clone him quick.

B00006RIO7|5.0|First off, if you haven't seen the movie Chicago, see it now! Don't finish reading this review, forget about walking the dog, and forget the Super Bowl; ok maybe I went a bit too far but you get the point. This is one of the best movies that I (an avid movie buff) have ever seen and it's clear that the full compliment of tinseltown stars (Renne Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and Ty Diggs), engaging and witty plot, and outstanding soundtrack all help make Chicago the first-rate movie that it is. The ingenious behind Chicago is that while the main story is being told, there is also a purely musical accompaniment to that story. So for every major event and happening in the movie you get a solid 1920's jazz bit for either clarity or for just all out entertainment! The music is just fabulous. All of the cast give stunning dance and vocal performances and those great vocals are ALL on this soundtrack! The soundtrack alone could tell the story but I'd strongly recommend seeing the movie first; it's just more fun when you can sit back, after seeing the film, and imagine the dancers going all out over and over again. I kid you not that this jazzy lineup is one of the best theatrical soundtracks ever! Just a mere 10 minutes after exiting the movie theatre I bought this soundtrack; I knew it was that good and knew that I just had to have it. My generation's music honestly pales in comparison to this and it's performances and songs like these that really make me wonder what our children will look back on and listen to. So, bottom line: SEE THE MOVIE, BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK!

B000002H6C|1.0|First of all, I must admit I'm surprised of the number of good reviews about this album. <BR>I own all Metallica albums from 'Kill'em all' to the 'Black album' and for me, this is by far the worst of all. <BR>My favorite is 'Ride the Lightning'.<BR>Before I start hammering this down, I must say I'm not a huge Metallica fan and I'm not dumb.<br />1. The context <br />This album is a mistake. It is too much influenced by the death of the former bassist 'Cliff Burton', and it seems like this was only released to cry out the pain felt about it. <br />2. The bass <br />After the death of Cliff, the remaining members of Metallica offer a warm welcome to 'Jason Newsted', the new bass player : that is to say, they arranged the production to remove all the bass... No bass can be heard on this album.<br />Jason is not a bad bass player. You can hear him playing good bass on the 'Black album'. And please, you narrow-minded people, don't tell me the 'Black album' is sellout : it's the best after 'Ride the Lightning'.<br />Oh... I hear you complaning : 'the bass is not important'. It's to wonder if you've heard 'Orion' on 'Master of Puppets'. This makes me realize how important is a bass player. I have hundreds of metal albums, and 'Justice for all' is the only one with no bass. Hearing an album like Iron Maiden's 'Powerslave' after this shows a shocking difference !<br />3. The drums<br />Lars Ulrich may be the most overrated drummer of all time. He's also the most pretentious. He's proud of himself kicking like a cow on the double-bass. And maybe because of bass removal, the production made the drums so loud it's laughable. By the way, the drums don't sound like drums : you hear them 'clicking'.<BR>But I haven't finished : they seem to be recycled track to track, and the rhythm hardly ever changes. Believe me, this album contains the worst drums ever recorded.<br />4. The guitar work<br />Nothing special to say about James Hetfield's playing. I would say it's overall boring and repetitive guitar riffs through songs which are much too long.<BR>Kirk Hammett can hardly be heard on this album. Definitely not the guitar hero I have known on 'Ride the Lightning' and 'Master of Puppets' which showed great solos on every song. The only decent I heard was on 'One'.<br />5. The song writing<br />The advantage of the album is that it has a subject : Justice. Or maybe Injustice. The coverart is well representative of it, although you can't judge an album by its cover.<BR>The songs are not bad written, but it's always the same: darkness, emprisonment, blindness, ...<BR>One other thing can be wondered : Why did Jason co-write only one song 'Blackened' ? Why did they hire a new bass player to leave him in the corner ?<br />Conclusion :<br />Yes, this is their worst.<BR>No, Metallica's career is not over.<BR>Yes, the 'Black album' beats this by far.<BR>No, it's not only a production problem. This is really tasteless.<BR>Songs are long, boring, repetitive, and head-aching.<br />'One' is the only reason to get this. 'Eye of the Beholder' is not a bad song, but I highly prefer In Flames' cover. 'To live is to die' is not too bad, but again much too long ...
0767849493|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest of all time. Added to that, it is also one of the most philisophical and thought-provoking. The movie starts with the Catholisism WOW! Campaign, in which George Carlin, a cardinal trying to advertise Catholisism, changes the crucifix to a less morbid \\"Buddy Christ\\" (giving the thumbs up to the people) However, the movie revolves around another promise made by the Cardinal; whoever goes under the arches of the church would be forgiven of all of their sins.<br />Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play two fallen angels that God has decreed would never re-enter heaven. They plan to go through the arch and then die sinless, going to heaven. However, this would prove God fallible, therefore destroying existence as we know it. <BR>God chooses Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) to stop them: Alan Rickman appears as his? voice to guide her. The irony: Beth is a lapsed Catholic working in an abortion clinic. Bethany accepts, however, and starts on her way, chased and hindered at every turn by Jason Lee (the Demon Azariel) and his trio of hellish hockey players. However, Bethany has aid, in the name of three prophets: Jay, Silent Bob, and the black 13th prophet, Chris Rock. Salma Hayek as a sexy Serendipity, and Alanis Morissette as a forgiving and nature-oriented God round out the excellent cast.<BR>The movie exposes much of the blind faith, right-and-wrong beliefs, and the fact that so many righteous people are terrible humans. It explains how each religion has twisted the truth to fit its own dogma (such as the fact that Jesus was black). While the exessive F-word and gore are turn-offs to the movie, the overall comedic value and excellent acting, not to mention the philosophy, far more than redeems it: making it in my eyes at least one of the best movies of all time.
B00005JLF5|5.0|To Amazon Customers, <BR>One of the most exciting series to come out of the Star Trek universe since the \\"The Original Show\\" is now coming to DVD. This series being Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Unlike other releases of the Star Trek universe, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine takes place on a space station on the edge of the galaxy bordering a worm hole to another galaxy. In this region of space, the Federation has managed to bring temporary stability by overtaking the space station called \\"Deep Space Nine\\" from another race of humanoids known as Cardassians. The Federation has just defeated the BORG at wolf-359 and is in the process of rebuilding the fleet. A star ship commander by the name of Benjamin Sisko played by \\"Avery Brooks\\" is assigned to take over and manage the station for the Federation after his ship was destroyed in the encounter with the BORG. It is at this point the series begins.<br />Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was an ambitious series and attempt to take the Star Trek universe into new directions. Even Paramount Studios was taking by surprise at how quickly the show reached new audiences and brought back some old time SCI-FI fans. Among the many elements explored in this series were: in-depth plots and sub-plots of the various races of the Star Trek universe. It was Deep Space Nine that explained the race of the Trill in which the character Jadzia Dax played by \\"Terry Farrell\\" was fully explored. Deep Space Nine focused on the race called the Ferengi which led to one of the most popular elements of the show: The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition. <br />By far the most popular race explored in the series was the Klingons. It was in this series that viewers learn the culture and traditions of this warrior race. So popular are the Klingons that even today organizations around world in over 14 countries meet regularly to celebrate and re-act the scenes and traditions of this race. <br />Star Trek: Deep Space Nine also took a different direction in terms of the mechanics of the stories and plots. For the first time, the series took on the concept of a continual plot and story themes from one episode to the next, which was never really done in previous Star Trek television shows. Deep Space Nine also was the first series to have the entire cast of characters to learn the nature of each other during the course of the series. In many previous Star Trek shows, the characters were all assigned to a particular star ship, which lead to a common theme in which all could work from. Deep Space Nine did not have such a common theme and the characters had to deal with the situation as each developed. <br />I could go on but the best thing for you to do is buy the DVD and take a look for yourself. The first season started slow but as the each season progressed, you find yourself drawn into a story with rich in-depth development of plots and sub-plots that will leave you waiting for the next episode. This series is a welcome addition to the Star Trek DVD releases. If you like SCI-FI with rich stories and character development, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine will fit the bill. Whether you are a trekker or a SCI-FI fan you will enjoy Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. :-)

B000002BUY|5.0|But to hell with that. It's just that damn good. I started listening to Incubus mostly from hearing their music on Fungus Amongus (which is also a great album, I love it to death) but this is just simply amazing. Every member of this band is extremely talented (even -- no, especially the DJ). Dirk Lance, having written bass lines like those from Fungus Amongus at the age of *fifteen*, could probably get up in the most accomplished bassists of modern music -- up there with Jaco, Stanley, Les, and Vic. The guitarist is probably the most proficient I've ever heard with the wonders of effects pedals, and we all know how well Brandon sings (although he really comes into his own in later albums). The drummer is...well, he's just that damn good. And of course, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is where their DJ debuts on one of their albums, and to wonderous effect. Truly excellent. The entire album is brilliant.<br />Note: Yes, the ENTIRE album. I don't know which person it was that said it, but Deep Inside is a great track that keeps up with the rest of the CD and then some.
B00004Z459|1.0|WOW! Now THIS is what I call metal! Fast, palm-muted riffs, blinding sweep arpeggios, elaborate double-bass drumming, and poetic lyrics covering topics ranging from war to injustice! Seriously folks, I think it's a crying shame that no one I bump into anymore knows what heavy metal even is. I've heard people call Aerosmith, the Greatful Dead, and even the Red Hot Chilli Peppers heavy metal. ...
B00000I8BX|5.0|This is THE album to own, regardless of what kind of music you prefer. For example, I'm a big Pixies fan. But even my favorite Pixies album-- Surfer Rosa-- simply cannot compare.<br />I'm not a music specialist, so I won't use too many fancy words or even get into too much detail. But one thing is for sure: Burton's demanding vocals-- from the screams to the most beautiful melodies-- are not to be doubted. Get this album by whatever means you must.<br />Before I heard 'Descent', I didn't like music nearly this hard-- but I was drawn in. And so you should be. Do yourself a favor and get this album.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Best movie I've watched in a long time. Chase scene was the best. Loved her. Non stop action was great!! So what if it Doesn't follow the book exactly. People that do not like this movie because of that should stick to books. You should buy this movie it's that good.
B00004XOWM|3.0|A word of advice to those of you who are willing to put up with Fred Durst's *F-word* fetish...DO NOT get the edited version of this album!  On some of the songs, so many words are cut out that the song actually becomes irritating to listen to, leaving you thinking that you would rather hear the foul language than deal with a song that's half-way gone because of editing.  The album has some good songs, including both versions of \\"Rollin'\\" and the theme from Mission Impossible 2.  \\"Boiler\\" is also a very awesome song, especially if you have some good subs to jam with (listen for the punches of low-low bass throughout the song).  If you're into some harsh rock and you don't make the mistake of buying the edited version, you'll enjoy this album.
B00006IU73|5.0|After being turned on to PT by a friend, I am on a mission to go out and by the whole collection. They are the most refreshing band of the new millenium. Until now I have been mostly a metal or alternative fan. After all the [music] I hear on the radio I have found my new #1 band. After listening to \\"Strip The Soul\\" and  \\" Prodigal,  PT will stay on top for a long time to come.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is one of the most original artists to come out for a while.  They're mixture of punk-rap, heavy metal rock, and chunky guitar rifts result in some of the catchiest songs out there.  The album is definitely worth the money, and be sure to buy their remix album &quot;Reanimation.&quot; They are perfect additions to any music collection.
B00004W5UA|4.0|I didn't want to watch this movie at first, but I was at a friend's house and he told me I had no choice : &quot;You're a psychology major; you're going to watch it and you're going to like it.&quot;  I am Joe's complete surprise over how great this movie is.  No doubt the film is incredibly violent; it's not for the weak of stomach.  But the storyline made so much sense and the twist at the end was awesome.  By the way, the book was also very good and gives you even more insight into the narrator's thoughts and especially his past.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Sure, I understand why a lot of people would complain about the mellow, seductive, melancholy atmosphere of Sea Change, but seriously, anyone who would listen to Sea Change once, cringe and deem it \\"boring\\", must be heartless! These songs are probably even better-written than the ones on most of his previous albums. Don't buy this album expecting it to be laden with samples, turntables, or random distorted sound effects. In fact, if you're a fan of Beck, it'd probably be a good idea not to EXPECT anything, because if you do, you'll either be perplexed or disappointed on first listen. Just merge with the music and enjoy the way it makes you feel. You see, Beck's music has always challenged conventional song structures and manipulated audio soundscapes, which is still the case, except now Beck is using the sound effects and textures for emotional resonance, which is quite different than the \\"ear candy\\" heard on Odelay. The mood is considerably mellow and very emotional...depressing, but thoughtful. I think Sea Change is just as musically inventive as his others, but the intrumentation is more subtle. There are many musical and emotional climaxes in the songs, which can easily move a person to tears. What do you expect Beck to do when he's depressed, write a goofy bass-heavy club song with turntables and samples?? The honesty of Beck's emotions come through very well in his delivery. His tone is ice-cold on this album. Wonderful for rainy days.
B00004RF9B|5.0|- Some good special effects involving the spaceship, the weapons disintegrating their targets, the vast subterranean Krell complex.<BR>- A simple but compelling story<BR>- The performance of Walter Pidgeon<BR>- Anne Francis (hubba hubba)<br />There are a few minor problems with the film, like the goofy ship's cook character, but they don't detract much from this very enjoyable, landmark science fiction film.<br />(By the way -- some other reviewers have noted the debt owed this movie by subsequent sci-fi franchises such as Star Trek. This is undoubtedly true; if you've seen the original Star Trek pilot &quot;The Cage&quot;, you can see the similarities in the space vessels, uniforms, weapons, etc. -- not that they look exactly the same, but that they have the same feel as those in Forbidden Planet).
B000066NW0|3.0|When I hear Complicated and Sk8er Boi I expected a Punk Chick type of Cd.  I was wrong.  IT's good music but not what I thought it was going to be.
B0000399WI|5.0|I'd give this 10 stars if I could. I have watched it over and over and love this movie. The story is fantastic and so are Robbins and Freeman. This is a must for any collection.
B00005JKNC|3.0|This movie tries to be a \\"feel good\\" movie, and at times it suceeds; however, it absolutely fails in the last 20 minuts of the movie.<br />I was quite impressed with Jim Carrey's acting.  He has matured and developed from his Firemarshall Bill days on \\"In Living Color,\\"  and the crude gags of \\"Dumb and Dumber.\\"  He is following in Robin William's footsteps in being a comedia who has the passion and sense to be a serious actor.  I have no quarrel with his abilities.  In fact, all of the extras added to the feel that Lawston, CA was somehow the essence of every Norman Rockwell painting.<br />Moreover, I was impressed with the supporting actors.  David Ogden Stires (Winchester on M*A*S*H), plays the town doctor so well, the actor becomes invisible in his part.  Walter Landay, too, has evolved beyond his \\"Space: 1999\\" and \\"Misssion: Impossible\\" days.  He is a late bloomer, but he evokes so many emotions.  He played Luke's father perfectly.  In fact, the congressional inquisitor Elvin Clyde, played by Bob Balaban (Dr. Chandra \\"2010\\") stokes the emotions of righteous indigation, despite having a minor role.  The details are perfect.<br />Other technical aspects of the film, such as the cinematography, the costuming, and even the old 1940's rumblefish automobiles were spice to the eyes.  It was a well prodcuced film, and the shots of The Majestic theater evoked fond memories of the Oakland Paramount or the old Alameda 3 art deco film palaces that I attended as a lad.  I flet young again as I wastched this film.<br />I think where the film breaks down was in the the sub-plot realing to the communist hearings.  I really did not relate to Jim Carrey's plight.  In fact, it seemed out of place in the over-all story of an amnesiac making a difference in a small town.  I think it would have been better to start the film with the hero waking up on the beach as an amnesiac (which is a classic birth image of water and forgetfulness), and leave it more ambigousous.  Think about the tension as Carrey plays the piano and the ticket-take say \\"Yes, I taught him boogie-woogie,\\"\\" and then have the congressional inquisitors come to town!<br />Or another possible ending could have had Appleton REALLY be Luke Trimble.  It would make the film layered and complex, and also be more emotionally satifying.  As the film stands, it seems a mishmash of iron and clay.  If they wanted a feel-good movie, then make it a feel good movie; if you want to make a staement against the communist witch-hunts, then make a statement.  The two cannot be reconciled in the same movie.<br />There are three things to look for.  First, in the black-and-white film \\"Sand Pirates of the Saharah,\\" if you look closely and quickly, the idol that The Evil But Handsome Prince Khalid holds is the same idol from the beginning sequence of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\"  Second, the electrical cables in the daytime outside sequence when the turn on the Majestic's lights for the first time are the same one used in \\"Back to the Future.\\"  Third, the town's main strip is the same one used in \\"Signs.\\"  If you hate the movie, at least you can keep your eyes peeled for this.<br />The DVD has one hilarious extra.  They include the entire sequence of the black-and-white film \\"Sand Pirates of the Sahar\\" that you see in the movie.  I grew up seeing 1940's reruns every Saturday on the UHF, and found this small segemt to ge a great tribute and parody of the old Errol Flynn films.  Someone really has a good sense of humor!ension as Carrey plays the piano and the ticket-take say \\"Yes, I taught him boogie-woogie,\\"\\" and then have the congressional inquisitors come to town!<br />Or another possible ending could have had Appleton REALLY be Luke Trimble.

B0000648WZ|1.0|Well Verhoeven has long since proven that he has a talent for making the most mindless gratuitously violent garbage anyone could ever wish to see. But what do you expect from a director who once famously stated: That he, and some of the reviewers here, try to defend this turkey on the basis that it is a work of satirical genius is laughable. I agree totally that Heinlein must be spinning in his grave, and that Verhoeven, if he ever bothered to read the novel at all, failed utterly to understand it's meaning.
0783226063|1.0|This is about as bad as a sci-fi film can possibly get. The story makes very little sense (I haven't read the book). Also, the script is very poor and makes it hard for an otherwise fine cast not to appear ridiculous. The film had a $50 million budget and yet its special effects are quite bad even by 1984 standards. David Lynch is a great director and thus one can wonder how he managed to create a travesty like this. Do yourself a favour and stay far away from this piece of ****!
B000062Y98|5.0|When i first bought this cd I didn't really know what to expect, I had listen to the song (Battlefield) on a local heavy metal radio station and loved every second of the song. Two days later I decide to buy this album to see what it was like, as soon as I put the cd in my cd player I wanted more of Blind Guardian. Now that i have 4 of there cd's in my collection (A Night At The Opera, Battalions Of Fear, Imaginations From The Otherside and Somewhere Far Beyond) i'm hoping to extend my collection even more with there great music. <br />Blind Guardian Are The God's Of Power Metal \m/\m/
B000000OQF|5.0|When it comes to heavy metal you can't help but menchion Guns N' Roses. Appetite for Destructioned earned them thier respect from not only the fans but the critics also.Each song on the album on a scale of ten (ten bieng the best) each song would recieve a score of either 9 or ten.To like this album you can't be just a listener who likes hits.People who don't like the album probably don't like heavy metal.In a world where hip hop music reigns as the majority the heavy metal scene is fading and this is one of the albums keeping the scene alive.My final call on the album is   if you don't already ow it purchase it.Heavy metal lives on.
B00001IVQT|5.0|Ashkenazy recorded the Rachmaninoff piano concerto no. 3 at different points in his career.  This recording, the one with Fistoulari, was his first, and in my estimation his best.  He had just shared first prize with John Ogdon at the 1960 Tchaikovsky competition, and was at his technical peak.<br />I owned this recording of the Rachmaninoff 3rd when it first came out on LP.  I grew to love this concerto through it, though in my estimation the recording by Cliburn and Kiril Kondrashin surpasses it.  The cover of the LP indicated that Ashkenazy  recorded this performance in one cut without edits.  It seems all the more special for that reason.<br />These recordings of the Rachmaninoff concertos nos. 2 and 3 are marked by nobility and some restraint.  Ashkenazy takes an almost &quot;classical&quot; approach to these concertos.  Some might call him reserved, but it would be equally appropriate to say that he chose to dignify Rachmaninoff and protect him from what can be a tendency to overly romanticize this music.  For me, the third concerto comes off more successfully with this approach.<br />Consistent with this more reserved approach, Ashkenazy plays the shorter, less showy, cadenza in the first movement of the Rachmaninoff 3rd.<br />This recording will always have a special place in my collection.  It is beautifully remastered and worthy of its placement in the Legends series.
B00005JLO2|5.0|This was an excellent film.  The more modern special effects were excellent and the slight changes to the story line were improvements.  There will always be loyal fans of the 1939 version and I count myself among them but you must give Heath Ledger credit for being able to carryout the part made famous by Ralph Richardson.
B00007AJGH|3.0|First of all, sorry to contradict you, Luis Arturo Gutierrez Calv, but \\"...Roger Rabbit\\" does NOT have CGI effects!  While I was living in Los Angeles shortly after the film was released, one of the animation directors for the film was a speaker at a special \\"...Roger Rabbit\\" symposium at an animation festival. He directly answered a question from the audience about CGI in the film by stating that even though some effects LOOK computer-generated (specifically, the reflective kitchen floor in the opening cartoon segment), everything (even the sequins on Jessica Rabbit's show gown reflecting light like minature flashbulbs) was done the old-fashioned way, by HAND!! Yes, Richard Williams (main animation director) is JUST THAT GOOD!!! As the speaker (whose name escapes me for now) put it: (and I'm paraphrasing by memory here) \\"the only time the animators used their computers was in figuring out equations\\" for camera angles and such!<BR>That same director also mentioned three scenes that were cut. Namely, the \\"Aaah! I'm a pig!!\\" scene (which was in commercials for the movie during its theatrical run!) that has since been shown on network television (and is included on this dvd), the scene leading up to that one: Eddie Valiant being caught...in Jessica Rabbit's dressing room, I think...by Jessica, Judge Doom, the Weasels and the Gorilla Bouncer, and gag tycoon Marvin Acme's funeral, featuring Forhorn Leghorn delivering the eulogy (which are not!)!! <BR>Also, I was fortunate enough to be acquainted with voice-over actress Norma MacMillan who recorded lines for \\"...Roger Rabbit\\" as Casper, The Friendly Ghost!! But where WAS the little guy?? Perhaps at the aforementioned funeral??  Why isn't this scene included??  Even a 'rough' animated pencil test of it would be MORE than welcome!!  <BR>We were also treated, that evening, to seing the ENTIRE 'Bob Hoskins in Toontown' sequence WITHOUT the animation!!  It was simultaneously fascinating and hysterically funny seeing the brilliantly talented actor (who truly deserved an Academy Award nomination for his under-rated work in this movie!) reacting to such devices as wooden sticks with 'x's taped to them, representing Bugs and Mickey!!<BR>Well, the movie itself is still a classic, but why weren't these truly special 'extras' included??  Hopefully, this will be rectified by an 'anniversary', or 'SPECIAL-special' edition. <BR>But THIS version's lack of goodies which I KNOW are out there (such as footage of Joe Pantoliano...remember Ralphie from 'The Sopranos'?....playing Eddie Valiant (!) in a VERY early animation test!)  will cause me to hesitate from buying this dvd on March 25th. And for someone like me....for whom animation and cartooning are pretty much my LIFE!!...that's a hard thing to admit, indeed!
6304602979|5.0|This movie was suggested to me by a girl I worked with, she said it was her favorite movie of all time.  Needless to say I watched it the first time with a huge amount of skeptisism. All I can say is that I was wrong to doubt.  This movie is beautifully written! You get all the gritty violence you could want while still holding the greatest underlying love story in any movie I've seen. This is the ultimate guy movie/chick flick combination.  Nowhere else have I seen a man(clarence/slater) so in love with someone he just met(alabama/arquette) that he would go kill her pimp, now that is LOVE! This movie is not for the squimish but if you are a guy with a soft side you don't want to admit to, or a girl that can stomach some blood, this movie is a must see! Pay close attention to all the stars in this movie, they knew it was a good investment so should you.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Just got home with this double CD and listened to the whole thing, I already had Degradation Trip Vol. 1. The songs witheld the first time around are even more phenomenal than the others we've all previously heard. This unbelievable archive of Jerry Cantrell's soul told through music is probably the best heavy metal album I've ever heard. Do not miss this double CD, it's a limited edition, it may not be around forever!
B000066NW0|5.0|Overall Review: 4.5 Stars<br />Avril Lavigne: Punk Rock or Bubblegum Pop? Pre-packaged or totally independent? On all counts, I really couldn't care less. I bought this album to listen to, not to judge Avril's musical genre and independence level. Moving onto the actual review, I found &quot;Let Go&quot; to be quite a good listen. Some songs are more catchy, like Avril's breakout hit &quot;Complicated&quot; or the lighter-toned &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, and others are angrier, like the hard rock-sounding tracks &quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Losing Grip.&quot; Either way, the songs are fun to listen to and we can all relate to the subjects Avril sings about. I know I could completely relate to &quot;Unwanted&quot;, where the singer/musician expresses her frustration about be judged by her social status instead of her personality, or &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, where she talks about being nervous around a person she really cares for. This album may not be the punk rock type that so many people seem to expect just based on her image as skater punk, and while Avril may have declared herself a punk rocker and behaved completely hypocritical, it shouldn't stop you from buying her excellent debut, and for the music alone.
0671646788|4.0|I like this book and got a lot out of it. My favorite part is about turning defeat into victory -- very useful. I agree with others that different people have different favorite motivational books. Napoleon Hill's Positive Mental Attitude is OK by me, but Norman Vincent Peale in his Power of Positive Thinking is a bit too religious for me. I do like the psychology book the Positive Power of Negative Thinking by Dr. Norem. Whichever turns out to be your personal favorite, I'm confident that you will find the Magic of Thinking Big by David J. Schwartz to be a very useful addition to your list. His book is a real classic, and it deserves to be.
0385503954|3.0|Part One of the tale is beautifully written, in an old-fashioned Britannic way, and does a good job of setting up a situation which the reader might hope will lead to the &quot;atonement&quot; promised by the title.  Part Two, unfortunately, fails utterly to deliver; the &quot;atonement&quot; is an unsatisfying copout.  It's hard to justify the many rave reviews this book has garnered.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I've loved Miyazaki's work for a long time. I had the special opportunity to meet and speak with him (thru my japanse girlfriend) opening night at the El Capitan Theater (Disney, Hollywood) during the filming of what we were told was to be included in the DVD Extras.<br />If you love Totoro, Kiki, Mononoke, this one will top them all. The movie includes characters found in previous movies, but they do not make their presence obvious. The giant \\"Daikon Kami\\" is just a small representation of the imagination and brilliance of Miyazaki.<br />This movie was originally produced for younger sub-teenage children, but as his previous works attest, a more mature audience can also appreciate the superb animation, voice talent, lip-to-speech calibration (for the english dubbed) and overall storyline. I have recommended numerous adult friends to go watch this in the theater, and none have come back with negative <br />This one is not to be missed.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Upon hearing \\"Lost Cause,\\" my wife and I were absolutely SHOCKED to find out that Beck, Mr. \\"Beefcake Pantyhose gettin' crazy with the Cheez Whiz,\\" was the artist behind one of the most amazing cross-over albums since the country/rock fusion of the mid-to-late 1990's.  At first, we thought it was a fluke - that he put out one song to appease the masses and filled the rest of the album with his typical funky schlock; however, we were happy that the rest of the album was not a disappointment.  It was as if Beck started listening to David Gray and was somehow sucked into a new level of maturity.  He isn't \\"bummed out,\\" as some have said - whatever it is that he has had bottled up, it has fermented and turned into a fine wine instead of a grating whine.  Hopefully his talent won't spoil and turn back into a grating whine after this album - instead, we hope it will get better with age.
B00004DTLI|5.0|It seems to me kind of funny that this album has very little popularity. IMHO 500 Years from now it will define white boy Metal Rock Blues, if you care to catorgise music to that level. The remaster with 4 added songs only adds to the value of this blues rock masterpiece. Every musician on this record appears to contribute to the end product. They all have notoriety in the field of English musicians and easily prove their worth with this fine recording. Check out &quot;Company of Snakes&quot; for more non pop Real Whitesnake.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I work at the Hines VA hospital here in Chicago, and have the distinct pleasure to spend some quality time with, as we affectionately call our WWII vets, \\"the old timers.\\"  Stories of terror, courage, and triumph abound in the words of these guys.  One of my patients was a tank commander who landed on the beaches of Normandy and could not help crying when describing the D-Day invasion... seeing his buddies get blown away, having to run over bodies on the beach, etc.  Another old timer was in the big red 1 and also landed on the beaches of Normandy.  Unfortunately, this veteran has a pretty severe case of Alzheimer's demenita, to the point where his short term memory is non-existant and he is unable to dress himself.  You ask him, \\"What did you have for breakfast today?\\"  and he'll just stare and smile at you.  If you ask him, \\"What were you doing on June 6th, 1944?\\"  he immediately replies, \\"Omaha beach, D-Day.\\"  The powerful images and remembrances of that day will never leave this man, and speaks to the incredible debt and gratitude our country and the rest of the free world owes these soldiers.  When I see some medical students complain about having to take care of these vets, I always try to remind them that none of these veterans are \\"charity cases\\" and they all have rightfully earned their right to the best health care.  As the time since WWII grows longer and longer, and people don't remember anymore, there's been a trend towards cutting funding from VA hospitals.  I find this to be a tragedy.  Sure, there are those veterans who never served and are drug addicts and whatnot, but the old timers are to be respected and given our best attention.  Please watch the Band of Brothers and educate yourself on the extreme sacrifices put forth by these guys in the most trying of circumstances.
B00006RU5B|4.0|While rumors of an incendiary collaboration between Chris Cornell and members of Rage Against The Machine mill about just prior to the release of Audioslave's debut album, I am of the firm belief that tension breeds brilliance and this is no less true of the Cornell/Rage first effort.  This album truly smacks of the very early Seattle scene when bands played from the gut with nothing holding them back.  &quot;Cochise&quot; is a fine testament to even pre-grunge angst when bands like Soundgarden and Jane's Addiction were only underground sensations and Saigon Kick, a highly underrated band, were disregarded as a hold over from the big hair metal bands of the eighties.  Some tracks are a bit too 'mature', like &quot;What You Are&quot; and &quot;Like A Stone&quot;, but then I guess all good musicians, when they get older, tend to express themselves in a not-so-in-your-face way.  &quot;Shadow On The Sun&quot; is very strong but I think the highlight track on the album is &quot;Bring Em Back Alive&quot;.  This track reflects perfectly the influence of Black Sabbath on many grunge bands. All in all I would say that for those of you sick and tired of the whamsy-pamsy music congesting even alternative rock radio stations today, this is a must have.
0316666343|2.0|Though Sebold's scenes of the family's grief and mourning of Susie Salmon are convincing and often wrenching, her depiction of heaven as a subdivision, where everyone has their own place and intake worker, seems silly and false.  Sebold's setting up rules for the place (the dead cannot interact with the living) and then breaking them twice (the final time a teenaged deflowering) is artistically flabby and dishonest.<br />Like most bestsellers, this book has been praised far beyond its merit.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I just got the cd last night at Best Buy, and i like it.  T.A.t.u's debut album is a mix of great lyrics and catchy music put in one.  To extend this review even more, i'm gonna break it down by songs.<br />1. Not Gonna Get Us:  A terrific song, I must say.  The lyrics, though somewhat repetitive (\\"Not gonna get us/not gonna get us/not gonna get us...\\"), the beat and well-mixed track get's the ear's attention.  Julia and Lana's eerie duet voices add a cool effect to this song.  <br />2.  All the Things She Said: This over-played song (I've heard this song enough times) is, I must admit, a well-written song and a terrific example of how well European dance music can get.  The rebellious (if that is the right term) lyrics of \\"girl-loving-girl-will-their-parents-ever-accept-this?\\" is interplayed with a mix of guitars, cool percussion, and awesome vinyl scratches.  Whoever mixed this song rocked (Robert Orton) and did a great job.  <br />3. Show Me Love: Another \\"girl-and-girl\\" song, this song is alright, not as good as the rest of the cd, though.  Good mix though (In fact, that's what I'm going to end up saying about the rest of the CD).<br />4.  30 Minutes: Okay, this song is creepy, but good.  If you put the volume up and play it in the middle of the gym, i'd bet you'd feel like you were in a cadethral.  A good song with a very creepy tune (if that's Julia who whispers in the beginning, that was a good effect).  The use of the piano, soft laughter, and weird organ sound was great.<br />5.  How Soon is Now: I don't remember this song.<br />6.  Clowns (can you see me now?)-Their voices were very high in this song, and the fact that they were talking about clowns scared the hell out of me (i have a phobia for that sorta thing).   <br />7.  Malchik Gay:  This is ultimately one of the coolest songs in the album.  It is so catchy, you'd end up humming it or nodding your head to the tune (for those of you who are russian, what the hell does the title mean?).  <br />8.  Stars: I always liked music where they intermixed two different languages into one song (check out Breath after Breath, by Duran Duran), and \\"Stars\\" is one example of it.  Julia and Lena's soft, high voices is used very effectively in this song, and the way they used Russian in the song was cool.  You know what I have to say about the mix itself.  This is a wonderful song, with a sort of beauty in it.<br />9.  Ya Shosla s Uma:  If only I understood Russian, this original version of  \\"All the Things She Said\\" is a great song.  I think this was the debut song there, and for good reason.<br />10.  Nas Ne Dagoniat: The original Russian version of \\"Not gonna Get Us\\", all I have to say is that it's terrific.<br />11.  Show Me Love (extended version): see #3.<br />   Well, that's about it.  The CD overall was a pleasure to listen to.  I like it a lot, and I can't wait till their next album comes out.  Good job, Trevor Horn!<br />By the way:  Julia, you are seriously hot!!!
B000021YQV|5.0|Definitely artistic. Definitely inspiring. Definitely political.  Although sometimes System of a Down gets a little too hardcore for me , this is an album with a vision, and political statements abound. Take \\"Prison Song\\", for example, declaring that mandatory sentences (for drug offenders) be abolished and instead utilize drug treatment. Then there's \\"Toxicity\\" (my personal favorite ) about the condition of our cities, and how no-one can really control the world...because the world is disorder.<BR>    Now, I'm a personal fan of melody...and System of a Down's songs are about an even split of melody and random screaming. I enjoy the random screaming...as long as there's a melody somewhere in the song. Some of the songs miss out on this and therefore...I don't really like them (like \\"Bounce\\", for instance). But the intelligence and artistic vision that comes with this album is definitely worth the monetary exchange.
B00006CYAD|5.0|I never liked punk that much, but after listening to this cd i luv it.  This cd is awesome and i listened to it 2 months straight.  It is really catchy and have great songs that many people can relate to.  I recomend this cd to everyone.  Its amazing
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Crawford definitely deserved the Academy Award that she won for this role. It's a depressing film but well-acted and has a sharp and well-paced storyline. I highly recommend it.
0800105141|4.0|In a stunning performance, Ben Kingsley stars as the famed Indian leader who showed the world that non-violent resistance was an alternative (and better) way to bringing about change and political justice.  From his rise to prominence in South Africa, fighting against unfair racial laws, to his role in bringing about the independence of India from England, Gandhi stood firm with his ideals and maintained a simple life.  Director Richard Attenborough fills Gandhi's story with beautiful visuals, yet doesn't shy away from presenting the brutality of violence that Gandhi tried to avoid and end.  Kingsley is simply amazing in the lead, seemingly inhabiting the body of his character.  The supporting Western cast are often little more than cameos, well done although not necessary, and the Indian cast are excellent.  The pace is a little too slow at times, but the film is rich in atmosphere and the photography is beautiful.  I knew very little about the life of Gandhi prior to viewing this film, and I come away with a knowledge of who he was and an appreciation and respect for what he stood for.  Once again, I am reminded of how the actions of one man can affect the world and the power of standing by what one believes in.
B000068CNX|5.0|Well, first off, I must say that I love Friends immensely... I wasn't a huge fan but when I got the first boxed set I was hooked!Then I got the 2nd season and lo and behold, it was just as good, if not better than the first season! I watched all the episodes in a very short amount of time (it wasn't unusual for me to watch 3 hours worth of episodes in one sitting!!) When Rachel and Ross finally got together, I was content...until TOW The List screwed it all up... but AGAIN love prevailed! Now if only the recent episodes would get it together, but thats another story.<br />Anyways, get this and you won't be disappointed! I can't wait til the 3rd season comes out... and I still have to get Best of Friends - I've seen it but the wonderful thing about Friends is that you can watch the episodes over and over again and they are still hilarious....
B00000I9P1|4.0|I'm almost ashamed to admit how much I love this album. It's so schlocky, so cheesy, corny, goofy, 80's, unhip (even for its time) and radio friendly but darn it, it's one of my favorite albums of all time. Almost every track on this one reminds me of Lays potato chips. You can't just listen once! Er, or something like that. <br />I prefer to rate individual tracks when I'm reviewing music CD's.<br />1. \\"How Much Love\\"<BR>The first track is really upbeat, hey, like most of this album. The guy's wondering how much love will it take to get this girl and whether his creepiness will scare her away. That's it, no guns, no bling.  3/5<br />2. \\"Keep It Right Here\\"<BR>The cheese continues but fortunately, it's fine velveta. This is the first of many \\"commitment\\" songs on this album and it makes you wonder if these guys wrote these songs for their wives or girlfriends. There's a sincerity about this song that is rare in pop music. 5/5<br />3. \\"Is This Love\\"<BR>This is admittedly my least favorite track, probably because I've heard it too many times already. The keyboards kind of annoy me. The saxophone solo is awesome though. 2/5<br />4. \\"Man Against The World\\" <BR>Oh, melodrama. This piano ballad is a great song. That's all I can say about it! 5/5<br />5. \\"Rebel Son\\"<BR>Arguably the best track on this album. This song starts off kind of slow then picks up speed with an 80's beat that could have scored any \\"Karate Kid\\" film. It'll have you coiffing your hair in no time! 5/5<br />6. \\"Oceans\\"<BR>I never really liked this track. 1/5<br />7. \\"When Seconds Count\\"<BR>Yep. Another commitment song. But this one's excellent and once again there's a sincerity here that is quite rare. 5/5<br />8. \\"Backstreet Love Affair\\"<BR>The organ riff in this one will be stuck in your head forever. 4/5<br />9. \\"In Good Faith\\"<BR>Another commitment song and my favorite track on the album. This is a typical power ballad that goes from piano to guitar. This was a really popular wedding song back in the day. 5/5<br />10. \\"Can't Let You Go\\"<BR>The album ends with a great upbeat track. And good lyrics too. My hearts been branded/I can't let you go/Don't understand it/Just can't tell you no/Don't leave me stranded/'Cus I just can't let you go. Er, alright. <br />Buy this album. Please. If people keep buying old Survivor records, maybe that'll encourage them to get back together, like all the old fogies do. I'm looking forward to that!<BR>6.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus can not write good lyrics.  They're meaningless and often sound like very strained attempts to seem deep.  They're not.<br />Everything else is great.<br />Aqueous Transmission is worth the price of the CD alone...
B00006RIO7|5.0|I saw this movie with much relectence. But like the title states, i saw the movie, then i got the cd and listened to it, and i loved it. My daughter will not stop playing the cd at anytime of the day! I love, she loves it, and my wife loves it! It's a family thing.
0743201140|3.0|For a manager who desires increased productivity and a happier work place, start with &quot;First Break all the Rules.&quot;  It has much better advise about how understand and manage people to their maximum productivity than any other management book I have ever read.  This is a follow-up book that goes more deeply into the basic &quot;talents&quot; that people have.  At first I thought it was almost devoid of content when set against the marvelous first book from the Gallop Organization.  But now that I have used its concepts for six months I am rereading it again and again.  <br />The on-line &quot;Strengths Finder&quot; is very much geared toward corporate (or non-profits) organizations and finding strengths that help you in an organization.  But once you have these defined, and if you actually use them in your organization, these &quot;themes&quot; are extremely helpful.  Because you not only use them yourself to understand why you are good at some things and struggle with others, your manager and coworkers can also use them to understand you better.  This really works best if the entire organization works toward a strengths-based organization, but I have seen miracles in the groups that blazed the path first at our company.  One manager (who has no empathy) told me that she uses the themes like a black box.  &quot;I can't really understand what it is like to have Harmony or Woo, but now I know if I put X type of person in Y type of situation, Z will result.  It has simplified my life as a manager tremendously.  No longer do I ask someone with Harmony to go to meetings filled with controversy, I send someone with Woo.  When the details are critical, I give the job to a Deliberative person.  When thought and planning are required, I make sure that the team has plenty of Strategic and Arrangers.  But when I need the fire put out now, I ask an Activator to get it done now.  My people are much, much happier, the work expectations are much clearer, and our productivity is up.  The concepts in this book and in First Break All the Rules have made a huge impact on our company, our employees, and our stress levels.  I highly recommend it!
B000007T1M|5.0|I am absaloutely thrilled to pieces that i got this album. System of a down is a pure metal band that is totally different to other metal bands in a good way. They are very talented in that they have great lyrics about social issues, and they can talk very fast, and they can just really put on a show. I have known system of a down eversince i was ten and they have never let me down. This propbably has to be my favourite album ever because it is the most hardcoriest out of all their albums and it has the best sound effects, guitar riffs, and singing and screaming. I am so glad i pushed myself into buying this album otherwise i would miss ot on all these great songs on this album. One of my favourite songs on this album is suit-pee, suggestions,soil, p.l.u.c.k. There is only one song that did not get 10/10mark on the album. I own ever album and single by system of a down and the best ever album by them is system of a down with a rating of 97/100. If you like their more acoustic stuff i sugest you buy their newest album steal this album, but i have to say there more well known for there heavy stuff than their acoustic stuff, but don't get me wrong im not saying their acoustic stuff is bad because i actually bought the acoustic album by them and i enjoyed every bit of it.                                                             Not to be nasty but out of the group i would have to say <BR>serj tankian(singer) is the most talented because he's the one who writes those great poems and lyrics and he has a great voice and he does really cool types of singing like he sings, fast talks, raps, and even chants which i find amazing, though every person in the band is amazing and if their had to be a seconde it would be daron malakian for his great guitar riffs and he has written lyrics for some songs on the album but not many. If there had to be a band simailair to them it would have to be slipknot even though to me they are very different as slipknots singer roars in his songs and system of a down is more high pitched and tends to differ with his styles of singing. If you really like their hardcore stuff i suggest you get another album called toxicity buy them which is not quite as hardcore but still great. I hope you found my review helpful because it took me an hour to type while plan so please do not say my review wasn't helpful and last but no least GO BUY THE ALBUM!!!!! AND IF YOU LIKE THE ALBUM(which you should)GO GET THE OTHER ALBUMS!!!!!!!!
B000069HK2|5.0|To be pumped up or calmed down. Although the Product Discription is as accurate as could be wanted, words can not come close to describing the deep-felt emotion that makes this album. The musicians on this album vent anger, broken heart, and frustration better than any other band I have heard. The Used aren't just out for money or fame. They don't put words together just for the sake of hoping it will sound 'cool' and someone will buy the album. They are very passionate about their music and the way they incorperate their feelings in-depth. If every genre was like this then thier wouldn't be such a thing as Pop music, and the world would be a much better place to live in.       NOTICE: I am not asking you to agree with me. Just asking you to be openminded.
B000067CPX|3.0|This album is not what i expected. I expected this album to be just like californication which is more heavy and funky.There is only four songs on the album that i like which is BY THE WAY which is a very funky song, THE ZEPHRY SONG which is more of his songs which make you feel like its summer, UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING which has great singing and great vocals and a great chorus, THIS IS THE PLACE which has wierd music. The only song i don't like is CAN'T STOP which has a very old fasion sounding guitar intro and horrible vocals which sound .... overall this  album is worth a 7/10 so its worth buying and my opinion may be different to others because the chili peppers did win an award for the worlds greatest band, but all i can say is californication is better, so if you would like to an album by the chilli peppers go buy californication and believe me you won't regret it.
0064471837|5.0|I'm an advid fantasy reader and this is my second favorite book ever. (The first being its sequel Lirael)<br />Sabriel is a story about a girl (Sabriel if you haven't guessed) who is looking for her father, Abhorsen. Abhorsen has the power to use bells to put dead things back in Death (Death is a place) Lirael also has this skill. While she is looking for her father Lirael finds there is something very wrong in the Old Kingdom. Dead are everywhere running rampant with no one to stop them.<br />Sabriel is awesome. With a strong feminine lead and plenty of magic and action there is no way someone can hate this book. My summary can't even begin to describe it.
0634022296|4.0|This book is a bare-bones chord structure guide to the songs written and performed by the Beatles in the 1950s and 1960s.  It gives no real illustrations as to the exact fingerings used by the Beatles on their records.  Titles include official discography rejects like That Means A Lot, You Know What To Do, and You'll Be Mine (all of which made appearances on the Anthology), but, inexplicably, do not include the 1970s Lennon demos-made-Beatles-singles Real Love and Free As A Bird.  Seeing as the latter two songs were released as singles and thus should count more as Beatles canon than early-era testbed dross like In Spite Of All The Danger (recorded and released purely by incident), this book is, in my book, somewhat less than complete.
0812550706|5.0|First of all, i want to say I HATE SCI-FI! Well at least i thought i did... Ender's Game proved me wrong. <br />Ender's Game is about a boy (Ender) who was born to be a brilliant stategist. He is put into the military to train at the age of 6 and is expected to defeat a race of aliens the &quot;buggers&quot;.  Ender struggles throughout his military training disgusted with the tactics the adults use to make him the best officer ever.  <br />Ender's Game was a great read. My favorite parts were the ones about the battle room in which Ender has to use strategy to win games. I recommend this to anyone. Even fantasy readers who find sci-fi distasteful (me) will find this book to be excellent.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is, in my mind, the single greatest Superhero movie ever made. The only one that comes close is the original Christopher Reeve SUPERMAN of the late 1970s. The film is action-packed, and yet it has a heart. The special effects are awesome eye-candy, but are far from the sole reason to buy this DVD.<br />The forte of this endeavor is that it succeeds where so many Superhero movies have failed: it humanizes a young man who has almost omnipotent powers. Tobey Maguire is a credible Peter Parker, and this movie is almost more about Peter Parker than it is Spiderman. The biggest flaw of most Superhero efforts is that they pay too much attention to the hero and too little attention to the hero's secret identity.<br />Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as the object of Parker's infatuation. She has an adorable girl-next-door beauty as opposed to a glamorous / COSMOPOLITAN magazine-cover look. In short, this is precisely what the film needs as Dunst's character is the symbolic all-American sweetheart that so many of us guys fall in love with in high school - but are never able to actually date.<br />Willem Dafoe is, quite simply, the greatest Super-villain of all time. Sure, Gene Hackman was great as Lex Luthor and Jack Nicholson was memorable as the Joker, but Dafoe is utterly PERFECT as the Green Goblin. What's more, as is the case with Spiderman, the film does a remarkable job of humanizing his character as well. This is perhaps the least comic-booky seeming villian I've ever seen, despite the fact that they pulled the Goblin straight from the pages of a comic book!<br />I cannot say enough about just how well-done this movie is. The soundtrack, courtesy of Danny Elfman, is outstanding. The direction is terrific, as is the acting. As an added bonus, the 2nd disc offers commentary and backdrop material of both the comic strip as well as the movie.  Most significant is an interview with the creator of SPIDERMAN himself:  Stan Lee.  It was terrific to see that he had a big hand in the writing and production of SPIDERMAN.<br />The symmetry and length of the film are right on the money. The attack by some movie critics that the movie was too long is nothing short of ludicrous. It had just the right mix of the stories of the Goblin and Spiderman, enough grand standoffs + some mini-adventures along the way.<br />The author C.S. Lewis once made the straightforward and yet trenchent observation that one should never critique a literary work that belongs to a genre that he dislikes. The same holds true for movies. If you don't like Superhero movies, you're most likely not going to like this one, for a Superhero movie is what it is. However, if you do enjoy Superhero films now & again, I can't imagine you NOT liking this production.<br />The majority of movie critics who gave this film a poor rating did so not because it's a bad movie, but because they don't care for Superhero films. That is their prerogative, of course, but it also nullifies their tirades. After all, you can't \\"blame\\" a film for being of the genre it belongs to.<br />As I walked out of the theatre as the credits rolled, I felt remarkably \\"ordinary\\" and mundane.  I cannot give a greater compliment to a movie of the Superhero genre, for that is precisely what you should feel like after viewing a story such as this.<br />SPIDERMAN ROCKS!in the writing and production of SPIDERMAN.<br />The symmetry and length of the film are right on the money.

B000001Y2U|5.0|This Marilyn Manson album is very good and and it ROCKS!Just about all the songs have a huge climax...........The music is much different compared to his other cds except Holywood,although the lyrics are very anti like it is still very good.The album starts out and keeps going real fast about all the time and ends with THe man that you fear.Buy this cd if you like heavy sh** and if you liked Portrait Of an American Family or Holywood you will probably like this one better than those.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters Inc. was definitely a one of a kind movie.  The plot was very good and very unique, while the animation was the tried and true Pixar style.  It was pretty funny, although not as funny as I hoped, yeah, and it had some morals built into it, the subtle type.  I do think that any audience would like it, although the younger group would probably love it.  It was good with no obvious faults, and maybe the reason it was not as funny as I hoped was its deep set storyline.  But, altogether a good movie.
B00000ILDF|4.0|So maybe this movie is dark, and spoils the fairytell ending of aliens,but what's the problem.  This movie is better than Resurrection and at times I like certain aspects of this movie better than Aliens.  Alien 3 again relies on atmosphere and the superb acting of Sigourney, to tell a story of hope that is surrounded by despair.  In the movie \\"Spoiler\\" Ripley survives the aliens encounter to crash land on Fury 161.  During this time she finds that she is the unfortunate victim of the queens last remaining egg(there is confusion here, is it one or two eggs) and finds that she is the last remaining hope for the survival of the prisoners and all of mankind. Most of the actors are british and that is one of the few negatives of the film.  You can't go ten seconds without one of them shouting something raunchy in a dialect you cant understand. I found that turning on the subtitles will let you pick up certain tiblets of info that you may have missed during your theatric or home viewing of this film. The performances by Weaver, Dutton, and the actor that plays 85 are on the money.  Some people think that this movie is somehow less believable than the other ones, but I feel that it is more real(not realistic)in the fact that you can sense the urgency of the situation, and feel the gloomy loss of hope that the characters in the movie are feeling.  All in all I like the movies as they go in order, but I do think that this was a perfect way to end the trilogy. One womans sacrifice to<BR>save mankind.
B000002UAU|5.0|I'm 16 and right now this album seems to reflect how I feel a great deal.  I bought it completely on a whim.  In the fact,  I didn't even realize it was an album at first, or really what it was at all.  The words \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" just popped into my mind one day and I knew I had to find their meaning.  So I ordered it off amazon knowing relatively nothing about it except, at this point, that it was a Beatles album.  So it arrived and I listened to it, and all at once I felt very happy.  <BR>     There is something deeply beautiful about this album.  The sounds get inside your head and begin doing thing, vibrating and stimulating little parts of your brain.  Suddenly tiny flashes of warm memories begin to come up at random, and soon everything good, and free, and beautiful is on your mind.  This album inspires happiness and creativity, and makes life seem a little more wonderful.  These last few days I've been more open to the excitement and possibility of just being 16 in this great, big beautiful world.  War, and politics, and all the confusion of the world don't really matter suddenly, because they're so small when compared with love and art.  This album is a real cynicism basher.<BR>     On a more directly critical note, the songs themselves are wonderful, and move from one to another with such fluidity that the album almost seems to be one progressive song.  That is just one example of how clear and precise the vision of the album is.  This is particularly impressive when you consider how totally disparate the influences are; there are so many completely different elements involved.  But all the songs seem so similiar, so in tune with each other.  They're all masterpieces, with the possible exception of \\"Within You, Without You,\\" which is kinda a downer compared with the others.  \\"With a Little Help From my Friends,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" \\"Getting Better,\\" \\"Lovely Rita,\\" \\"A Day in the Life,\\" all these and the rest are absolutelybeautiful, so lyrical, and so terrifically happy.  This may be the greatest album ever, if not, its certainly the most inspiring.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a great book about a loving friendship between two old friends named Morrie Schwartz and Mitch Albom. Mitch made a promise to keep in touch with Morrie, his favorite professor, when he graduated from Brandeis University. Mitch failed to keep his promise to visit Morrie, so they both went their separate ways. One night while flipping through the TV channels, something caught Mitch's attention. On Nightline, Morrie was being interviewed about living with the disease ALS. Mitch and Morrie were reunited after sixteen years when Mitch went to visit Morrie after watching the show. They became close friends again, and Mitch decided that he was going to fly from Detroit to Boston every Tuesday to visit Morrie. They discussed various topics such as the world, regrets, family, emotions, aging, money, love, culture, marriage, forgiveness, and death. Tuesday after Tuesday, Mitch noticed a decline in Morrie's health. Sadly, on the fourteenth Tuesday, Mitch was forced to say goodbye to his dear friend, and Morrie passed away a few days later.<BR>I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a new perspective on life and learning a few life lessons. It was truly a great book, and if you choose to read it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B00005KAQP|5.0|Whoopi Goldberg stars in this wonderful comedy that everyone must see. She plays Delores, a struggling lounge singer in Reno. Her boyfriend Vince gives her his wife's fur coat, and she heads off to confront him. In the process she witnesses a murder, and must run for her protection. She goes to the police who put her in a place that Vince would never suspect, a convent. At first resisting and being difficult, she becomes a nun and must partake in their activities and lifestyle. She is eventually asked to help the choir, which was in poor shape, and she turns it into a celebration and gets people to visit the church again. The nuns even help the community and turn it around. Eventually Vince finds her in which a hilarious pursuit of the nuns in Reno persists. Overall this is a really good comedy from the early 90s, really worth seeing if you haven't yet. One of my favorites.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I didn't think it could be done...but Serendipity managed to bump Pretty Woman off the coveted title &quot;ALL TIME FAVE&quot; in my book! This is the kind of movie that you just hope &amp; pray could come true because it really makes you want to believe in &quot;fate&quot; or karma or something else &quot;working&quot; out there. I could watch it every day..it touches your soul! I'm worse than a hopeless romantic..I'm a hopeful one! If you are,too...SPRINT to the store &amp; buy this for yourself! You'll adore it just as much as I did..GUARANTEED!
0151006903|3.0|Baudolino is a book that argues many theological issues as well as providing great climaxes incorporated into an intelligent adventure. <BR>Baudolino begins his story in the middle ages in Italy where he has minor adventures involving ducking out of chores by lying.  Caught in one of his lies, he runs into the woods where he is discovered by the Holy Roman Emperor, Fredrick Barbarossa.  He has many travels with Fredrick and gains many valuable friends along the way.  Unfortunately, his friends guard Fredrick's room one night and he dies.  They are accused of his murder. To escape, they try to complete the age old quest of finding Prester John, an ancient bible priest.  They do not find Prester John, but they find his son, a deacon living in a small town besieged by the White Horde.  Baudolino raises an army of the exotic creatures in the land to fight the Horde.  Because of some bad luck, they lose miserably. I would recommend this book to all people with an interest in history and those with a very high reading level.  This book contained parts in Latin as well as many difficult religious concepts.  I enjoyed this book, but the action was somewhat delayed.  As a summary, this book was difficult, slow on action and suspense, and somewhat depressing.
B00000AFFF|5.0|Four and a half, really. Elvis Costello's wrenching vocal work shine.  Some would say that Mr. Costello's vocals are rough, choppy, rockish.  But he envokes emotion in this release.  Bacharach always reaches us through is fine craftmanship and this release is no different from the quality musicianship which embodies his entire catalog. Highly recommended.

B00006M183|5.0|Being caught up unwillingly as the co-creators of the Grunge music in the early 90's, Pearl Jam carries a whole lot of baggage around with them and what's great about it is they don't even know it or seem to care. They are in it for the music and to them it's always been about the music. Maybe that's why they have gained longevity and are still vital creating new creases and folds around a loose central sound that has defined their core.<br />The way the band billed \\"Riot Act\\" as their best work yet and an excuse for Mike McCreary to go nuts with guitar solos doesn't quite get to what \\"Riot Act\\" is all about. The name itself is misleading. There are many shades, many elements here, some quite surprising. I'm not sure I would put it at the top of the PJ catalogue, but its pretty darn close...it's that good.<br />I'll skip the ranting and just give you a track breakdown. So here it is in my own words, so mark 'em:<br />1. Can't Keep. Others have described this as being a high energy classic Pearl Jam opener, but that's off the mark. What it does have though, is pent up energy, never quite exploding, but it's all there underneath the surface. A hopeful song, a catchy song more in common with No Code's \\"Sometimes\\" opener than Yield's \\"Brain of J\\"<br />2. Save You. Classic raging Pearl Jam with a nod to the past with, \\"Let's pick up your will. It's grown fat and lazy. I'm sympathetic as well, don't go on me now.\\" The band pauses while Ament carries the base line for awhile. In the studio drummer Cameron lost his head sets going wild with fills and plays out the rest of the song watching Ament's bass.<br />3. Love Boat Captain. And enter PJ's sixth man, Boom Gaspar that Eddie met jamming during a soul cleansing surf sabbatical in Hawaii. This song is a power ballad along the lines of Yield's \\"Fly\\" but is surprising that it doesn't carry the usual ebb and flow. It is hyperkinetic in that the band ratchets up the intensity fueled by Gaspar's Hammond Organ and never really comes off the plateau. Just when you think they are slowing down and extra dose of intensity is added.<br />4. Cropduster. One of my favorites. It shows yet another new facet of the band. Either McCreary or Gossard came up with this Eddie Van Halen-esque clean halting jumping lick that carries the day.<br />5. Ghost. The albums weakest track but a good song in its own right, saying something about the overall quality of Riot Act. Semi-droning moments during the verses. Great chorus though...kinda the opposite of Yield's, \\"Pilate,\\" another song by bassist Jeff Ament great verse, terrible chorus.<br />6. I am Mine. The first single. Powerful song as only Vedder can create. The best way I can describe it is a sea shanty, if there is such a thing. It has that side to side swagger of a bunch of sailors drunk waving beer mugs singing all together at the top of their lungs about the meaning of life.<br />7. Thumbing My Way. Vedder gets folky. Muted song and solid. Think \\"No Code's\\" \\"Around the Bend\\" or Neil Young's \\"Harvest.<br />8. You Are. Hail, hail Matt Cameron...the drummer no less. I had partly blamed the absence of ex-drummer Jack Irons departure for \\"Binaural's\\" semi-lack luster flatness, but Cameron adds this entire new wrinkle in time and sound for Pearl Jam. The band thinks it sounds like \\"The Cure\\" but it has that Pearl Jam edgy growl to the dance rhythm of Cameron's rhythm guitar loop. I liken it to The Who putting out a song like \\"Imminence Front\\" instead of the Cure.<br />9. Wanted to Get Right. A fun rave up with repetitive same note harmonic strumming. The chorus features Vedder's wild clapping as he has been known to do for some songs on tour. It's impossible not to bob your head to this one. This is a song that begs for fast-driving.<br />10. Green Disease. This is going to sound unusual in respects to PJ, but think The Who, The Clash, with The Go-go's bass-line thrown in. Forgive me the Go-go's reference PJ faithfull and Jeff Ament if you should read this.<br />11. Help, Help. Multi-layered hazed out verses and then it kicks into gear...one of the album's best. For this I claim Riot Act belonging to Jeff Ament (since he wrote the song) and leaves his bass stamp all over these songs. OK...we'll give co-belonging-ness to relative newcomer Matt Cameron for \\"You Are\\" and \\"Wanted to Get Right\\"<br />12. Bushleaguer. Politics aside (Vedder has a history of loathing Republicans and even greater loathing for the corporate rich...it's a crusade of his), this song is interesting. The first part is a little too thick and heavy sounding frighteningly near to Spinal Tap's rock parody...\\"How much more black could this be? None, none more black.\\"<br />13.1/2 Full. Interesting non-too-PJ sounding song. This kind of carries \\"Binaural's\\" \\"Rival's\\" halting skip guitar lick but instead comes off as a classic rock blues roadhouse song, if that paints the picture for you...kinda like think the Black Crowes meet John Popper meets Kid Rock with Pearl Jam all over it. I'm afraid that might miss the mark slightly but listen to it and try to put your finger on it...it ain't easy.<br />14. Arc. Vedder vocal tracks chanting ala Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Deep but not long enough.<br />15. All or None. Semi-droning melancholy with Cameron turning in some great traditional jazz snare and whatever you call those drumsticks that are made out of several thin metal strands. McCreary gets to show his chops in the end.<br />Great album. One of PJ's best, but not THE best.his.<br />11. Help, Help.

B00006RIO7|5.0|Wow, what a great album for a great movie.  Every time I listen to it a just want to get up and dance and sing along.  If you are a fan of musicals this is the CD for you.  The elite cast did a masterful job of recreating a superior show.  I would recommend first seeing the movie and then getting this awesome CD.
B00000JAD6|5.0|I definatley didn't expect this album to be from Eric Clapton.  In fact, I can't say I even liked Clapton before I heard this CD.  I enjoy the blues, especially when they give it a lot of heart and soul.  Eric certainly does that in this album.  I wouldn't recommend this to those who are expecting elevator music or light jazz.  This album is nothin' but soul music from a vocal powerhouse.
B000002KIE|3.0|This album is a must-have in the collection of anyone who claims to be a fan of punk rock music.<br />When this album was released in 1977,  it gave the music world the kick in the ... it needed. Anything musically that was done before was thrown out the window, and stripped down to three chords, and plenty of attitude.<br />The sex pistols invented punk rock no matter what any elitist punker will tell you. This band embodied punk rock. They hated their record company, they hated themselves,they hated each other, and they hated their government. And they invented selling out. <br />This album is forty minutes of  a fresh, chaotic, sonic assault that will change the way you look at popular music.<br />songs include: the two more well known sex pistols songs \\"God save the queen,\\" and \\"Anarchy in the UK.\\" This album also features such songs as \\"Holiday in the sun,\\" \\"Pretty Vacant,\\" and \\"EMI.\\"
B00005JLSC|4.0|In the past, I have never really been interested in movies that consist of mainly large musical numbers accompanied with Broadway dancing (Grease is an exception).  I saw the play Fosse (the man who wrote Chicago), and I didn't like it very much, but Chicago is amazing.  The story is fair; good enough not to complain about, but no Lord of the Rings.  The acting is very good, but once again, no Lord of the Rings.  It's the music and dance numbers are the real money makers for this movie, though.  Roxie Hart (Rene Zellwegger) has always wanted to be famous, but when she kills a lying boyfriend, she becomes infamous!  She imagines everything as a show, including her trial (check out Richard Gere's suit in that scene!).  I guarantee that you will enjoy this movie.
B000002ADT|5.0|Trying to write a review of Kind of Blue is like trying to determine whether the Bible is a good book, the Taj Mahal a fitting memorial, or mother's cooking up to scratch. Since it is one of those things that has probably actually shaped your own musical beliefs, aesthetics and tastebuds, and has long been accepted as the yardstick for excellence, what can one say about it.<br />It just IS what it is--Miles Davis, Cannonball Adderly, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and James Cobb in various combinations playing wonderfully cool improvised music that is kind of blue. And it is kind of good, too. It is meditative music, better for listening to while sitting at home, or in bed through headphones than for when you are barrelling down the highway or vacuuming the carpets.<br />Five tracks and about forty five minutes of perfection.<br />As I have posted a number of reviews, here is what I mean by my star ratings:<br />* A really worthless CD<br />** A CD that has some good stuff, but some major defects.<br />*** An OK CD that will please fans of the artist in question.<br />**** An excellent CD that represents the best work of the artist in question and can be bought with confidence.<br />***** An absolute classic that is the best, or among the best, of its genre. Your collection should start here.
B000001ZS4|5.0|I was unfamiliar with Jarre or any electronic music until I took a flight from LA to San Francisco on a spring evening in '82. Airlines are not known for their audio systems, but with the little tubular earphones on I happened to turn the selector to the featured artist: Jean Michel Jarre. As I watched the sunset EQUINOXE began streaming into my head and the sensation was unbelievable.  I had never felt so relaxed and serene. It was one of those moments you live for hoping, yet knowing, it can never be repeated. I wanted to tell the people sitting in front of me,  behind me, but I couldnt move.  I couldnt miss a moment of the music that seemed to be written for that very sunset I was viewing.  After we landed  I went straight to the record store and purchase the 2 cassettes: Equinoxe and Oxygene and then went to another store and got Magnetic Fields.  They, along with the Mannheim Steamroller's &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; series (discovered shortly there after) have been my favorites for years  and they never seem out of date. <BR>   Jarre knew better than to try to make electronic music sound acoustic. No synth horns or synth guitars. Instead he experimented  and let the music do what it was meant to do.  Let it do things that strings couldnt do   and horns couldnt do. What he gave us was origional, etherical  and mesmerizing. BRAVO JMJ
B0000024Z7|3.0|After the great three first albums Carlos Santana led his band in a jazzier direction, which you can hear on this album or on the live double album Lotus.<br />The earlier albums feature the unique high pitched, intensely rhythmic, latinate guitar styling of the eponymous Santana, which, in my opinion is what gave albums like Abraxas their unique appeal.<br />Here those strengths are traded in exchange for a jazz-rock fusion style, which to be sure still features the high pitched guitar, but without the rhymic driving force of the latin beats. It is also fairly apparent that Carlos Santana does not quite have the jazz creativity necessary to carry this off. There are too many long noodling solos that don't quite have the forward drive and propulsion that makes for really great music.<br />While the album is reasonably pleasant music for background noise, it is nothing special. If you like Santana's other albums, you will probably find this perfectly listenable. It just isn't very exciting.<br />If you want to hear a better jazz-rock guitar album, you might want to try Jeff Beck's magnum opus Blow By Blow in which Beck achieves a guitar sound not unlike that of Santana, but manages to sound like a real jazzman.
B00005JL96|1.0|Poor old Walt must be spinning in his grave at this one.  This is hands-down the WORST \\"children's\\" movie that Disney has ever served up.  I made the mistake of seeing this in the theatre because my family and I usually enjoy Disney films.  In the first few minutes of this film, Lilo is called \\"wierd\\" by a classmate, so she attacks the other child and BITES her.  Along with that lovely behavior example, Lilo and her sister live under the threat that a social worker is going to take Lilo away because her sister doesn't \\"measure up\\" as a guardian.  Keep in mind that the girls' parents were killed in a car accident(Why is that necessary in a kids' movie?).  My kids (3 & 6) were so disturbed by that story element that they had nightmares about losing us in a car accident and them being \\"taken away.\\"  In this day and age, children need to be allowed to be innocent as long as possible.  Disney used to champion this idea--NOT ANYMORE.  Do your kids a favor--keep them away from this movie.  It is NOT family entertainment!!

B000071ZZI|4.0|THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tightly conceived, well directed, well photographed and particularly well acted suspense thriller loosely based on the Robert Ludlum best seller.  True, many liberties have been taken from the novel, but when you take the time to note that Ludlum himself is the producer, then all arguments are off.  Matt Damon and Franka Potente are terrific as the amnesiac agent and his 'only friend' who helps him escape a mad and endless chase from multiple groups of would be assassins.  The characters are well developed - Damon gives one of his better perfomances, doing most of his stunt work himself while Potente continues to prove she is an actress worth watching.  The supporting cast of such fine actors as Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, etc help propel this movie along.  Outside of the French Connection this is one of the best car chases ever filmed - gratefully without the now-boring background of explosions and destruction.  In all a fine film that is delivered on DVD with interesting  and informative sidebars.
0784011176|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen is Jane Campion's The Piano.  Holly Hunter plays a mute mail-to-order bride who, along with her daughter(played by young Anna Paquin), travels to New Zealand to meet her new husband Stewart, played by Sam Neill.  Her one love is her Piano, but she must leave it behind, for it was to heavy to get to her new house.  Later Stewart trades the piano for some land to a man nearby Baines, played by Harvey Keitel.  Ada is to give him lessons.  At first she detests the idea, as she has everything since she moves to the island.  But Baines makes her an offer that she can't refuse; she can get her beloved piano back. It is then that we watch Ada's soul awaken as she spends time with Baines.  Her daughter Flora is like her best friend, but Flora will innocently betray her mother, which will lead to a dramatic climax.<BR>     Even though Holly Hunter few lines are voice-overs, this is her finest performance ever, winning her the Best Actress Oscar for 1993.  Anna Paquin also takes an Oscar for Best Suporting Actress.  The film also won an Oscar for Jane Campion's screen play, and was nominated for Best Picture of the year as well as several others.  Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel were equally impressive for their roles as well.  Michael Nyman's music is beautiful with its lovely saxophone melodies and a piano theme song that Hunter actually plays.<BR>      It is perfect in many ways and is a movie that should be in everyones well-rounded and complete video library.  It is one of those movies that you will want to watch at night all snug in your bed with some popcorn.  If your thinking of buying this movie; do.  It is just that good.  A+++
B000059H99|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. Rocky is a great story about a Philadelphia club fighter who gets the chance of a lifetime. Rocky Balboa is this character, played by Sylvester Stallone. His apartment is a wreck, he does not have much of a social life, and his no. 1 job is as a muscle man for a loan shark. But, when heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed has his opponent for &quot;The Bicentennial Fight&quot; injured in training, he decides to give an unknown fighter a chance. Rocky's nickname,&quot;The Italian Stallion&quot; catches Creed's eye. From here on in, the film is fantastic. The acting is outstanding, especially by Brgess Meredith, who plays Mickey, Rocky's trainer. A fantastic story, great music, good romance between Rocky and Adrian(Talia Shire), great antics from Paulie(Burt Young),Adrian's brother, and, of course, the great training montage highlight the movie. The fight scenes are also amazing. Rocky is simply and plainly a great movie. Th sequels are ok, but nothng beats the original.If you have'nt seen it, SEE IT.
0671578855|5.0|This particular installment is a well developed story that is exceptionally amusing.  It develops the characters and is told from multple POV's giving insight into several of the characters.  Unlike many series this one seems to get better with time, the energy of the characters and their development is very well handled over this multi-generational tale.  This particular book may be my favorite in the series to date.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Sabotage seems to be more famous for it being Ozzy's last great album with Black Sabbath and the songs itself and I consider it being their most underrated album of the 1970's but it does has its share of filler tracks.<BR>Hole in the Sky is a real badass tune with Ozzy's growling vocals, Don't Start (Too Late) a short instrumental which is the intro to Symptom of the Universe, one of Black Sabbath best songs and one of their last great anthems, Megalomania which is basically two songs melded into one, the first part sounds like a soft ballad but the second half kicks into high gear, and I consider this to be my favorite song on this album which has different layers of guitar riffs, Thrill of it All,...will grow on you after a while.<BR>Supertzar, is somewhat rather forgettable, Am I Going Insane (Radio) is perhaps the weakest song with vocals (even though it was Sabotage's only single and the only song to appear on We Sold Our Souls For Rock 'n' Roll) it's only worth it for the wicked laughter and the screams at the end of the song.<BR>The Writ, the album's closing track which is a tale about their management problems and it truly shows on this song, it's basically one of Black Sabbath's most saddest songs of all time.<br />The choice cuts are Hole in the Sky, Symptom of the Universe, Megalomania, Thrill of it All and The Writ, avoid Superztar and Am I Going Insane).
B00005QB42|5.0|This CD is the first time I have heard her music and voice. Not only is her music wonderfully soothing, (and the underlying drum beats sensually stirring), but her voice is very beautiful.<BR>I use this music, combined with gentle, loving massage, while lying in front of my fireplace, to soothe my lover's wearniess after a long, stress-filled day. The music is very calming, the stress just pours away. It is ethereal.
