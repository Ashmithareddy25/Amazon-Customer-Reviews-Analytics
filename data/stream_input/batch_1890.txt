B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was just good. I thought the characters were well developed and even though I did not understand some things, it was done in a really artistic way that I appreciated.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|Enya's voice is wonderful and the music superb.  The lyrics however were disappointing.  I t still enjoyable to listen to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow.  Started Hopeless last night and couldn't it it down.  Finished it at 3am.  I absolutely have no words!!!!!! This book was amazing.  Anyone that has experienced abuse, love, heartache and loss should read this....  It was definitely a page turner.....Laughed and cried.  LOVED IT!  Thank you Colleen Hoover for writing this beautiful book
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Nice action,kept me entertained from start to end. This actor is a very good up and coming action star. Can't wait<br />For the sequel?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I personally found the book to be relatable in many aspects and was unable to put it down! It's by far the best book that I have ever read!
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|I have no idea why something with only 200 pieces would be 50$. It should have been 20$ for what you get. 50$ means 4.68$ for each tiny cheap plastic piece( 234 pieces/ 50 dollars). I am a die hard LEGO fan but 50$?  Everyday you open a compartment in the box for each day leading up to Christmas. It shows you a picture of what you get and a little of how to build it. So you have to figure out most of it by yourself. Most of the time you get little brick built ships and sometimes you get mini figures. The only reason I bought this was for the two exclusive mini figures you get snowman R2-D2 and Santa Maul. I would get it if you are willing to pay 50 bucks.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|We watch this movie every year and it never gets old. If your looking for laughs and fun look no further than Christmas Vacation!

B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Mark Whalberg really did a great job with this movie. This movie will have you rolling! I would give it an A-
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really like the book. I wish i read the book first then watched the movie cause the movie missed a few details, like when cato killed the boy from district three. But i liked both and cant wait to start the next book.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|What can I say...it's Dickens, at Christmas...classic. I always enjoy reading this classic at Christmas and this e-version didn't disappoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honestly any praise I have for this book has been said, great book. Give it a read sometime when you get the chance.
B0094M4OW0|5.0|Such a dynamic duo in this drama/comedy with two great actors playing alongside each other.  The download was pretty quick on my Kindle Fire HD and I was watching it while it downloaded.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|So awesome and funny!Awesome job Jeff Kinney, so funny and fantastic. Kids luv it  like me.  Love u Jeff! :)

B001I8A76A|4.0|Excellent work. She says what most of us would like to! Certainly not for kids or the faint of heart.
B00A0A6F7C|4.0|Ovation has some great songs and Susan Boyle sings them so very well.  I highly recommend this CD and I downloaded the MP3 instantly to the cloud and it was quick and cheaper than the CD.
B0043OUZW2|5.0|Her music is a bit like mixing Pat Benitar with Pink! I recently saw her in the Alice Cooper &#34;Raise the Dead&#34; tour where she is the lead guitarist for the band. I fell in love!
B000007XUQ|5.0|This item came just as it was described. It was brand new and in perfect shape. I rec'd on Dec. 26th.
0634022296|5.0|Good gift for a young guitar  player.  He loved it , but then what's not to love with the Beatles
B0035XVVDY|4.0|really great movie hooked me up from the begining really keeps you up with whats going to happen all the time...the ending could have been better but still a great movie
0061537969|5.0|As a psychotherapist, I spend most of my time reading work-related non-fiction. This book caught my eye, however, and I had to read it. I am delighted that I did! I first came across the book a few years ago at my local Starbucks, when it was one of the books they were \\"sponsoring.\\" I had just gotten started when I moved, and forgot all about it. Recently it was brought back to my attention; thankfully so.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of the dog; The Art of Racing in the Rain is moving, insightful, fun, and fairly accurate regarding dog behavior (as I'm also reading: Inside of a Dog- What Dogs See, Smell, and Know by Alexandra Horowitz). It is also packed full of information on automobile racing, as Enzo and his Master, Denny, are both race aficionados. It is in Enzo's description of racing lessons learned from Denny (a part-time racecar driver), that the author (and Enzo) espouse lessons that are equally beneficial to life as they are to racing.<br /><br />It was a quick read, perhaps because I became so captivated by it, yet the ease with which I devoured it belies the extent of thought provoking material. The last few chapters left me struck with a truth that I do not yet fully understand. I hope that reading The Art of Racing in the Rain not only entertains you, but also leaves you pondering.
B00ADIT8U2|2.0|It's okay but really annoying at times. Obvious clues. I'm almost done - but no matter where I go, where I click - the last key is no where to be found. Limited scenes, and not as interactive as I hoped. There is barely a storyline too. Not sure why it's rated so high.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|its definitely worth watching once. I wouldnt buy it, but rent it and kick back a couple hours. Its cool.
B005LAII9O|2.0|When I first saw Savages pop up on the radar, I was stoked.  A story about two guys going up against the Mexican cartel, directed by Oliver Stone?  Sounds awesome.  Once I saw that Emile Hirsch was cast, I was all in (for some reason, I'll see anything the guy is in).  Well...did it live up to the hype?<br /><br />Savages is one of the most poorly written screenplays I have ever had the pleasure of watching unfold on screen.  The dialogue is laughable, and none of the characters have any traits that an audience member would want to latch on to.  One of the bits of dialogue, right in the first five minutes of the film, says something to the effect of \\"I have orgasms, he has wargasms.\\"  Sounds like something that a tenth grader would write in the first draft of a dramatic short story.  The acting is just about the same caliber.<br /><br />There's one action scene that was well done, but it was short and, well...too little, too late.  This train wreck doesn't even end in a satisfying way.<br /><br />Avoid this mess.  What was Oliver Stone thinking?
B0014DQSG2|5.0|great movie for anyone who likes kelly preston, collin ferth and amanda bynes. very funny and will keep you laughing til the end.
B009I2UH2W|2.0|This great product is now fatally flawed in the Lightning version because they changed the accessory plug light from red to bright white. Despite it's placement low on the dash, during night driving this bright white light now shines constantly in your eyes. The earlier version for iPhone 4S (30 pin) had a low profile red light. There are enough distractions and eye strain for night driving already. Who needs a small flashlight shining in your eyes the whole time, especially when it's sole purpose is cosmetic?
B00A757EFW|3.0|Good game but controll hard to use and its a small version of the original. The game cuts you off as you go higher in level. It's ok for the phone version.
0307744434|4.0|Personally I like overly descriptive writing when it's done well, and The Night Circus is something that delves comfortably deep in regard to detail. With the right director, this could be an absolutely phenomenal movie, as Morgenstern's setting is excellent. Scenery and paintings of scenes would be remarkable, and considering that Erin Morgenstern was a theatre major I'm not terribly surprised that she knows what she's doing here. Some sections of writing err on the clunky side, but this is her first novel so I'll cut the author some slack. It's an excellent first effort and whatever she does next should be even better.<br /><br />The circus is fascinating, although I do have to admit that the characters aren't as good. Reading the book feels like the author came up with the circus idea, embellished it, and adding characters when they needed to be added. Everyone is extremely flat and predictable, except Bailey (who is still predictable, but not flat), and he only become important near the end. There is hardly any character development at all, and in 500 pages you would think that they would grow more. This is my only gripe; people do what they're supposed to do in order to further the story and it doesn't seem as real as it should. The one credit that offsets this, however, is that the characters are still interesting. They may not have a lot of depth in what they do, but it's still fun to see them doing it.<br /><br />The conflict-turned-Romeo-and-Juliet plot is sparse, and I see complaints galore about that, but I don't mind at all as it's not a boring book. The open-endedness makes the book more of a story than a book, if that makes sense. You get to see how things progress, watching the circus expand and move around the world, enjoying the details. The Night Circus is not about simply getting from page 1 to page 528.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to others. Not everyone, of course, but there are people who will enjoy The Night Circus the same way I did.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|loved it years ago and love it now. Great book and very informative.<br />Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer.<br />Characters and other plot.
B0063IH60K|4.0|have this app on my kindle and my iphone and its breathing both! if you are a solitaire fan you wont be disappointed
B004V5QWU2|2.0|I had another app like this before I got this one, but it had a limited selection. This one boasted about its variety so I bought it. But I was disappointed to find that it is loaded with less than lulling sounds like &#34;hairdryer&#34; &#34;typewriter&#34; truck engine&#34; &#34;vacuum&#34; microwave&#34; &#34;driving&#34;, and here's a great one, &#34;snoring&#34;? I can hear that for free. Not only that, the sounds are supposed to be continuous, but  most of the tracks are very short, like 5 seconds, but they repeat /replay over and over. The bad thing about this is that you hear the brief gap between the end and the beginning again, so it ends up sounding like a record skipping. Just a poor quality app in my opinion.
0439023513|5.0|This book was a Christmas gift for my 11 year old nephew.  He also received Catching Fire from me and was really happy to get these two Suzanne Collins' books.  He said he would read them over the holiday vacation.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the sounds on this app. Although there aren't alot of them, about a dozen or so I think, they are very nice, soothing, and you can play several together if you want, like rain, thunder, and chimes as just an example. I recommend this app over another one out there called Sleepy Time that I wish I hadn't paid for.
0439023491|5.0|This book was a Christmas gift for my 11 year old nephew.  He also received Mockingjay from me and was really happy to get these two Suzanne Collins' books.  He said he would read them over the holiday vacation.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I thought that this game was really good for a free game. The layout is good but a campaign would be nice and well suited for this game. Sometimes there are a few glitches with buying extra gold and gems but nothing too bad. Thanks GameLoft. ;D
B009HELT3C|4.0|This was much better than I expected and well worth renting/watching. It was certainly a good sequel to its predecessors. Josh Brolin did an excellent job of portraying a young Tommy Lee Jones and Bill Hader as Andy Warhol was very funny. Two alien tentacles up.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I got this bag because Amazon was doing a special to include it for free with the purchase of a Canon Rebel T3i and I don't turn down free!  I did purchase another bag because I wanted one that was smaller and cuter that I would take out with me more regularly (and as a total novice photographer, I'm very happy with this decision).  This bag is big, so it may come in useful if I buy more accessories.  At the moment, I just have my camera and the lens it came with (an 18-55 mm) and this bag has so much extra space that I don't know what I would do with.  It would maybe be useful if I would be going around a city all day and wanted to pack more things, although the space is not super functional for non-camera things.  It would also be useful if I was going to be walking a bunch, as the backpack is pretty comfortable to carry.  It is not easy to just grab things out of without stopping though.<br /><br />The bag also seems to be pretty high quality.  The zippers feel sturdy, there is tons of padding, the outer material seems like it will protect contents well.<br /><br />If you're looking for something with a lot of space and is a backpack as opposed to a side bag, this product would be a great choice.  If you're more of a novice photographer without a ton of accessories hoping for something cute, this is probably not the best choice.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It came on time one day before it was suppose to come. Also great product as is. Great price then in stores.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD was my first Jillian Michaels DVD...never paid much attention to the biggest loser so I had no idea what to expect. I do want to say that  she was very funny and a great motivator. The dvd really worked me out and I was really surprised because I'm such a gym rat. So, I totally recommend this dvd for those who are intermediate level but for those who are brand new I would be cautious about starting this program because it might be to much.
B00122OTZC|5.0|Of course we're talking here about 3 of Country Music's superstars.  However, not all star singers sing that well with others. These 3 however sing together as though they were born to do so!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Wanted to see what all the fuss was about and experience what my grandchildren had<br /> been talking about.  Appreciated that it was pretty fair science fiction and not offensive with language;the underlying theme of good vs. evil was refreshing as well.  Will be reading the series......
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I love this movie. It has a big twist towards the end and it was really suprising. I love the show as well
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Awesome movie! Can not wait for the next one to come out! Does anyone know when that will be? Whoever hasn't seen Hunger Games, really needs to watch it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the first, but not the last, of Mr. Martin's I have read.  It is a fantasy adventure written in classic form and with full character development.  Commit and enjoy the lands and lives he has created in the multi-stage saga!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|My wife and I bought the Quadrilogy.  Thought we'd like it, but loved it.  Couldn't wait to get home each night, settle in and watch the next installment...  excellent!
B0063GORYU|4.0|The graphics are good.  easy to read on a small screen.  I like that there are levels of difficulty to build speed and skill.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The Epic has more tasks with more frequent challenges than the Original Perplexus. If you are new to Perplexus, get the Original first before moving on to the tougher Epic.
B004NSVF7C|2.0|Although I read the entire book, I thought many times about dropping it. It starts out well enough with a forgotten library book that gets deposited with Bartlett (which surprisingly enough she never makes any effort to return). But once the story proper gets going, it becomes much less interesting and somewhat tedious. I think I'll donate this one to our library.
B009HELT3C|4.0|These guys are great actors. Without them this movie would maybe suck. Who else could play the part? Who Else?
B0063IH60K|5.0|simple solitaire to enjoy when you have nothing to do.  bright colors and loved the hints.  Enjoy this game it's always a pleasure.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Accurate, unbiased narration of the history of cancer, it's effects and the society response.<br />It makes you pause that not all of our policies on cancer war is being made with focus on patients as a major stake holders!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Loved the hours my husband plays on it.  Very challenging and my husband always is amazed at the strategies on the counter plays.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Ended ok even in a bad world there is hope the main character was left with little in my opinion.
0425263916|5.0|This Was An Awesome Series I am So Hooked On This Novel cannot wait To See The  3rd One That Comes Out In May I have Pre Ordered It ...I received it very fast
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story was a good one when it comes to evil thrives when good men do nothing. I found main character a bit clueless. But I pushed on.
1401322786|5.0|While this story was a little hard to get into at first because of the format ...it continued to intrigue me and so I kept reading. I am so glad that I did!  I have never been disappointed by Mitch Albom. I would be hard pressed to name my favorite book!  For those people who have become jaded by the world we find ourselves in ... they will probably not enjoy this book and they might even find it to be unbelievable and sappy. But for those of us that believe always that life can be better and that we are all here for a purpose will find this book as moving and hopeful as I did. I am so glad that Mitch Albom always listens to his heart and has the courage to share his beautiful mind with all of us!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Still lessons for the youth to find. Open your eyes to your world. Play a part get your head out of the music and vid sand box.

B004EPZ0AC|5.0|The movie came in great condition for a great price.  I loved watching it with my 2 year old niece.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written, great suspense, and a page turner. I read the book in less than three days and immediately wanted to read the other books.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is an award winning movie.  It came promptly in great condition.  I enjoyed watching it during my flight during this holiday season.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Been a Batman fan since the black and whites on TV.  For those of you that also remember the old ones, you will find the ending as shocking as I did!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story kept me on my feet, confused and intrigued all at the same time. I wish that there was more to it, although I did enjoy reading  it. It was hard to follow who's point of view I was reading at times.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|just to short. it was interesting but needs to be a bit more challenging the graphics were good. come out with a sequel but make it longer
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Was a good read enjoyed the charectures and plot wouldn't consider it a five star read though maybe s three
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The detailed travels, people she meets along the way, hardships are written in such a good way.  It is not a boring hiking story.  It's a lively and interesting read.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|If u need to unwind your brain, take on this game for just a little while, before you know it you are rested and relaxed.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is probably the remote desktop with the easiest setup process. Easy to use as well. I do not know how the data usage of this app compare to the other RDP, However, using the application for roughly 10 minutes can run the data usage up to tens of megabytes. Since I use Wi-Fi anyway so not too much of an issue.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie, great story line, and wonderfully acted.  It is the &#34;Big Chill&#34; for seniors but is great for all ages!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great second book!  Couldn't wait to read Mockingjay! (Which I also finished and was not disappointed.) I definitely recommend this trilogy.
1400082773|5.0|This is a great book to read.  I recommend this for your leisure reading.  It allows you to see an entirely different side of President Obama
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Gripping story, right from the beginning. The battle at the end is very engaging. I watched the movie first and was surprised how closely it follows the book, but as usual you get a richer experience from the book.
0307592731|5.0|I loved this book and the author's spirit and pure grit!  Cheryl 's writing skills are brilliant and you are with her all the way. I simply could not put the book down once I started reading it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|A composer / lyricist / singer very much of the very late 1960s who truly surpasses the like of Bob Dylan and so many contemporaries, yet who is almost unknown to 'modern' music audiences ?? For me, hard to believe, but indisputably true, especially after I bought and heard this phenomenably wonderful album ...
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I really love this greatest hits album by Kelly Clarkson.  It is so good - I have listened to it several times and I have made up my mind - it is great!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first before reading the book. But the book was great and provided much more details and linked a lot of the relationships that the characters had. I can't wait to read book 2.
B005K2XM94|5.0|I ordered this for a Google Nexus 7 and it fits perfectly. As with everything from Timbuk2, the build quality is outstanding. Seems to offer a good level of protection.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this app every day. It has a few articles and word games along with a pronunciation guide. it is a nice addition to the kindle!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Can't play it enough. It is awesome! But i must warn potential players...this game is addictive....but I still cant wait to play it again.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the Rio version, it's my favorite! Watched the movie and now I like it even more!! Challenging and extremely entertaining. Warning: ALL ANGRY BIRDS ARE ADDICTIVE TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN!!!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Started out slow then about half way through, couldn't put the reading down until it was finished.  Great thoughtful writing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Buy the ad free. Worth the pennies it costs. Love Angry Birds! Developers are geniuses. Fun, fun game to play alone or with someone else.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|have only used this a couple of times but love it so far not quite sure how to use it very good yet but have only had a couple of days
B007RTAR64|5.0|The Katniss Everdeen Barbie Doll is beautiful!  Great price!  The perfect collectible item for the Hunger Games fan or Barbie collector!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|love it just as I love the camera kinda disappointed that the Kindle fire did not have these apps avaiable in the Kindle itself
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Read it in one day. I literally couldn't put it down. I really hope the movie will be similar to the book.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Love that I can veiw the weather from my Kindle Fire just like my phone.  Love it Love it alot
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a die hard Sean-Connery-as-James-Bond fan. I like most of Roger's and a couple of Pierce's. I was not happy when I first learned of Daniel Craig as the new Bond. Daniel who? Was my first reaction. Not another Lazenby, I thought...<br />I like Casino Royale, but it took me a couple of watches on DVD for it to grow on me. I didn't hate Quantum of Solace as much as others seem to, but then I saw Skyfall..... I love this movie so much that not one day has gone by when I haven't thought of it at least once. I saw it twice in one week, and I never do that when movies are in theaters. The writers of this film must be brought back for the next one, yes it has some minor similarities to The Dark Knight movies, but so what.  I can not wait for the Blu Ray release. I hate to admit it, but this may just be my new favorite Bond movie. The only thing that would make it perfect for me would be if Connery were still young enough to play Bond. The opening sequence, the action, Javier as the creepy villain, the surprises in the end.. It's almost perfect. Bravo Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson.  Now do it again for Bond 24....<br /><br />Oh...and did I mention the awesome theme song by Adele?? How perfect for the 50th year! Slightly reminiscent of Goldfinger theme, the Monty Norman 007 theme, very well done. Nobody does it better these days. Pun intended....
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Rather repetitious and monotonous.  Needs more different adventures in the game.  More interaction with the pigs other than trying to knock them out.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Quick shipment, thanks!  I appreciate the product being sent quickly.  It was exactly the product I needed for my equipment.
B000P0J09W|4.0|Not particularly for young children under 10.  The characters are a hoot.  A feel good movie!  Got the dvd to update my video library.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Whatever doubts you may be having about spending 5 bucks for this, forget them and get it.  Rarely does vocal talent surface that is so inspiring as to make one want to tell the world about it, but this is the feeling that these two will evoke in you. Even if you think Britain's Got Talent is all just hype.. even if you don't particularly like opera.. buy it anyway, I don't like opera either!  Or at least thought I didn't until I heard these incredible voices. I would have paid a much higher cost for an album of this quality; at the listed price it is an absolute steal! These young artists have a rare gift and it saddens me to think that Jonathan's voice could have been left undiscovered in a world that's been unkind to him.  Their young ages make them all the more unbelievable. This is one that I will listen to over and over and I eagerly look forward to their next effort.  Also, they MUST go on tour!  I can't imagine what they'd sound like in person.. there wouldn't be a dry eye in the theater. The highest praise goes out to these two. Thank you for sharing your talent with us!
0767836324|4.0|Great lessons but entertaining also.  Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams ... how can you miss?  Didn't like the fact that one of the kids is killed in the end.  Think they could have changed that ... didn't make the movie line any better!  If a movie is geared to children why would they put this in?
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is hard to put down! For those of us who did not go into details about the history of WW1, it's a good a good primer.
B000031EGV|5.0|Love Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt and they are great in this movie.  The special effects alone are enough to make you love the movie.  The story is wonderful ... don't know who wrote this story but they have an amazing imagination!<br />Exciting, fun movie. Had it on VHS and had to update my video library!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Not as stressful as pac man nor simplistic as bejeweled. Great graphics and just really fun to play. Has ratings so you can re play to get better scores.
B00519YRH2|5.0|Absolutely love this movie.  Tom Hanks makes you actually believe he is a child in a man's body.  This movie is a classic - it will never go out of date.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I had a few problems to start but that was because I did not understand how to play. Once I figured out how to play it became fun. Really love playing. Hard to stop.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Ilike it it easy to understand and it makes it easier to play. it shows what notes will be next.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I should have checked the movie when it arrived so that is my fault. But it was a gift for my son so I just wrapped it.<br /><br />The disc was not viewable. It was scratched and almost broken.  It also did not come with the digital copy or a second disc.<br /><br />Not at all what I thought I was buying.<br /><br />*edited to say that Amazon replaced the product and even paid for one day shipping.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved reading the book and am looking forward to reading the next in the series.  A well written suspense!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This was really a great look into the human mind. What we want to be and who we really are. How frail our psyches truly are, and the power they also have for our survival.<br /><br />Really must be seen to truly appreciate it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great, I hate reading but I read all day long. I finished in less than 3 days and now I love to read!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play solitaire and was happy to find I could play it on my new Kindle Fire HD. It is alot of fun.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book<br />Annabeth Chase and Percy Jackson are a good couple<br />  Girlfriend.  Boyfriend.<br />I hope that Rick makes more awesome books!
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I wouldn't recommend it,  but its a nice app. Though.... I HAVE TO UNINSTALL THE APP EVERY TIME I ADD A NEW SONG!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am not usually into these sorts of games, but this one grabbed me. Very well done. Graphics are cute, but i do play with sound off, as game-sounds annoy me in general.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|I would recomend this game to a pro gamer.Someone who is games.I recieved a kindle fire for christmas and wanted to try a game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game. The sounds are calming and it makes you think! Makes me want to go back and achieve perfection
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Since I am always checking the weather every morning before leaving for work this will be useful while getting ready.No more tv in the mornings.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I'm not that great at fast, hand/eye coordination games.  But I like puzzlers.  This is a pretty good one. Recommended for folks that like puzzlers.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This movie was every bit as enjoyable as the first MIB. I love how it brought to light more about K and J and how their lives were intertwined. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh, cry and be amazed by creativity!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Enough of the vampire love stories already!  Witches, ok.  Vampires?  ughhhh.  The only interesting part is reading about the Knights Templar or Lazarus...Really?  One more scene of a cold blooded hot passionate kiss against a tree...boring.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|You can't miss with two great actors like Streep and Jones. This is a sweet movie about marriage and the changes couples go through until... Well, I won't reveal the ending. Carel is wonderful as the marriage counselor. Don't expect his usual kind of role, however. I think a lot of couples will see themselves in these performances.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never review books but for this one I feel it deserves it.  It's been a long time since I've read a book that I haven't been able to put down.  The first story goes very fast (30 pages maybe) and my first reaction was that's it?  I did become skeptical when I started book 2 because it was new characters but that didn't last long.  I just couldn't wait to see what happened next.  The last 3 books focused mostly on one character, with other characters added as it went along.  With books 3-5 I was never sure which book I was reading I just knew I wanted to see what happened next.  This is a very fast read that doesn't have all the grammatical and spelling errors other indie books seem to have which is great.
B00006JDU9|5.0|Product was received in fine condition and plays just fine. I bought it for my grandson and I think he has watched it about 10 times.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Never knew you could become best friends with a rat, but this movie does that. I enjoyed the story and the great animation, the little details of how a kitchen is run are amazing. This is fun if you're young, but also when you're adult.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|ahhhh.. I watched this three times during my rental period and I think I will buy the movie.  Grew up in this Era and loved the music.  Def Leppard and Journey were some of my all time favorites and still are!  When I first saw the movie, I thought it was a little corny, but I loved the music and by the end I wanted to see it again.  I thought the cast did a great job,  loved Tom Cruise, Julianne Hough and the new actor Diego were awesome.  They all did well and performed/sang well!  I was impressed with Tom Cruise and he did great!  His \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" number was awesome!  That was my favorite part of the movie.  I can't believe it got such low ratings.  I think once people see it, can appreciate the music and humor and give it a chance, they will think it is awesome too!
B0091XRL86|4.0|This movie was quite funny. The comedy was on the spot, but there weren't too many of them. I think it could have been more funny.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I'm sure the game is great but I couldn't get this version to run on my niece's tablet, downloaded the regular game and it runs great.
B00448SE4S|4.0|This was funny and entertaining. Nice story line that captured my interest to keep watching. Interesting characters for an interesting movie.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|A wonderful adaption of a classic tale. But it is not for the faint oh heart.  Characters are likeable. A beautiful heroin,a wolf and two handsome suitors.<br />A village with a curse, a wolf enters the village one a month,but leaves the villagers in peace until one day a young girl from the village is found dead. Suspenseful and well acted.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|OMG! This movie just turned into one of my all time favorites! After watching it I sat there kicking myself saying, &#34;why did I wait so long to watch this movie&#34;!
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|Game was okay, but I have a Kindle Fire, couldn't quite play the game on the fire., It was hard to drive. The next person who goes in might like it but I don't recommend it for the KINDLE FIRE.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Was not what I expected. The graphics and special effects were really good, but it was missing something. Maybe it was missing some good actors. I don't know, maybe it's just me.
B005LF9AOQ|5.0|I just love this show and I hope they reach season 20<br />it's funny and fantastic cast specially barney Stenson
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have read this book many times and I love it every single time. I would recommend this book any time of year.
B00913DPW2|5.0|one of the best on the market. I played it x2. a little more complicated than 2 but this is a great adventure with a lot of challenges.  frustrating and wonderful. I highly recommend this!!
B00787IR2Q|4.0|Great family movie. Kool to think of being small in the big world. Kids will enjoy and not worry about guns. Just big bugs.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My 9 year old loved this calendar! Each lego was fun and easy to put together. He looked forward to opening each day.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The only thing I don't like is that the Kindle Fire version lacks the ability to earn free gems through watching ads each day like the iPhone version has, which makes gems hard to come by--which in turn is important because they allow you to speed up or skip quests (something I've had to do for the social media quests due to some connectivity to Faceboom issues). Overall this game is wonderful and soooo much fun! A must for MLP fans :)<br /><br />Edit: since posting this a few weeks ago, the ability to earn gems through watching ads on the iPhone version seems to have gone away. Although after playing the game on my iPhone as well for a few weeks I can say I prefer it as it seems to update more frequently (example: Hearth's Warming winter/holiday themed update with new quests and decorations and snow over Ponyville...and Derpy in a present box instead of cardboard.) and also it gives you daily bits and stars bonuses for logging into the game. Also the social tools are less glitchy (still glitchy, but less).<br /><br />Edit 2: Prepare to get really frustrated towards the end of this game. I've been playing for almost 5 months and I've purchased gems twice to get over the hump on some quests I got impatient with early on but I refuse to spend any more money on a \\"free\\" game so now I've gotten to the point where it is taking me weeks to do some quests because of how many bits and gems it takes to complete. The only pony I have left to get is Rainbow Dash, and before I can buy her (for 90 gems) I have to get Soarin for 250 gems. Yep, 250. When in a good week I can earn 14-20. And THAT is now only because they recently added back watching ads to earn gems, but cap you at 2 a day. The other way is earning 3 a week for logging into the game each day, and random drops you get from Parasprite clouds and finding Derpy (who can appear between 0 and 3 times a day from what I've seen). For people who don't log in every day (especially multiple times a day) earning gems is even more painfully slow and it's really disheartening. The only reason I'm sticking with it is because I have an obsession with finishing what I start. The game has turned into more work than fun at this point thanks to that. :/ **keep in mind, this is the iPhone version that I switched to after becoming too frustrated with the Android version on my Kindle Fire not having the ability to watch ads to earn gems back in January, I have no idea if they've changed any of the functionality on the Android Kindle Fire version in regards to earning gems**
B000YHG72E|5.0|A movie I watch everytime it's on.  If I see it on tv, all I have to do is yell, &#34;Elf is on!&#34; and the kids come running.  We quote it all the time.  A movie for everyone of all ages.<br />If you think it's &#34;dumb&#34; not funny, you need to loosen up.  It's very difficult to find movies that everyone can agree on, and appropriate for all ages.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|A clever little app (mostly) for kids that allows you to cut, shave, clip, grow, curl, straighten, style, color, and more.  Both of my kids like to play around with it ten minutes at a time designing a new style for one of the four characters.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift and the recepient was very pleased. Thank you for making her Christmas even better.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is incredibly addictive.  Once you win your first game, you will want to keep upping the ante and killing everyone on Earth all over again.  There are in- app purchases, but they are basically unneeded since you can unlock the same things by winning each difficulty.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My son was very pleased to get this movie for Christmas. He says he really liked all the action in it.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|What a delightful movie!  Sometimes I would miss a line due to the British manner of speaking fast and mumbling, but that got better later in the film.  A real joy to watch and giggle through.  Acting was really good, and the scenery was spectacular, wonderful to see foreign sites in movies, even if it was Morroco vs Yemen.  The 3 separate \\"worlds\\" - London, Scotland, and Yemen were done in great contrast, but finely connected.  Highly recommended!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I missed this series when it first started on TV.  When I caught some of the episodes on TNT, I really enjoyed them.  I ordered all four of the seasons available on DVD.  Now I get to watch them in order and enjoy the characters development.<br />I love the relationship between all the actors.  They are funny and each episode has a  really good mystery that they work together to solve.  Now I can enjoy them whenever I want.
B008476HBM|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't already been said?  That in my head I switch back and forth between Colin Firth and Sir Lawrence Olivier as Darcy? I'm certain that's been said.....read it for the first time or read it again. Top 5 best opening lines of a novel ever.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|It's different than most movies. Me and my girlfriend liked it a lot. Definitely a movie that will be worth your time.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Just watch the movie, it's a lot of fun. Wil is great and the kids will enjoy it too. It's not a typical sappy Christmas story.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Best book he has written yet,a thriller from the start to the finish This is a book that you cannot put down once you begin
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is an AWESOME album.  If you like these guys you will love this album.  Can't wait for their next one.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The movie was great. But I like an obvious crescendo at the end. And it was a steady stream of action to the end. Would definitely recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me so interested throughout the entire novel. This, by far, is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books and I cannot wait until the movie cones out.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I think my husband hates me now thanks to the wildly addictive game! My kids have barely seen me since Christmas.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|This stroller caddy works great!  I have a baby jogger stroller and I didn't want to pay another 20 dollars for the stroller caddy.  I found this one on amazon and I have been satisfied with it for past 2 years.  It holds two drinks my cell phone a snack, and keys.  There even is a zipper pocket for things you need to secure.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and was looking forward to this soundtrack. My biggest pet peeve is that the Titantium song is not on here and the Rift Off is not the same version as in the movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a fantastic book and a must read! I was caught up in the story from the first page. You will not be disappointed and this book lives up to the hype!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|my daughter and I love this game. we play it all the time and it was a great price.please make more games like it
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I'm not sure how these actors signed on for a script of this quality...but they did. Eastwood, Adams, Goodman and Timberlake are all quite good. Without their skills this movie would have been completely unwatchable due the script. Simplistic, clumsy and downright condescending at times, the writing for this film was atrocious. Even with the star power, I had trouble believing in the narrative truth of the film, with plot points edited in willy nilly, character arcs that resembled flatlines and an emotional arc to the film that resembled a child's (badly) written reading primer. I watched the film and got through it because of the actors (all of whom did a good job,) but save yourself the time if you are looking for something that has some subtlety or nuance in the script...because it ain't here.
B003VANOFY|5.0|this was my first buy on amazon.come and i love them  thay are soft on my head when i use them and the sound is just awsome they meet my standerds(sorry for bad spelling i cant spell)
0375851569|5.0|Nothing better than Dr Seuss for a baby shower gift.  It's something that will be used longer than some of the clothes that are given.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I gave this dictionary a rate of 5 stars because very easily to read and see very interesting n short and simple I advise this to middle school and up. Excellent!
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Wonderful sound quality.  I am not the biggest fan of this type of music, but as an appreciator of production this is a great example of what auto-tune cannot replace.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was splendid and inspiring. This is a great story that will keep you turning pages, I will read this again.
072325804X|5.0|Classic, timeless- beautiful. Sturdy, quality as expected for a hardcover book. Can Easily be a family heirloom for sure- pass it down through the generations, or buy copies for everyone!.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It's a very good game GOOD graphics a little slow but okay it makes you<br />Beaches when you have zombies and sword it u  that all.  Mini
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I love this show. So sorry there was only 1 season. great writing and great actors. watch this show you won't be sorry!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I any long running series I enjoy I wonder when the plot line will run out of steam. Based on Two Graves, this need not happen soon for the Pendergast stories. While there were the usual familiar elements, this book also kept me engaged, and, as usual, gave me a chance to enhance my vocabulary. A great book if you already read the series, and while not ideal, there is enough context in the book to start with this one.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I never saw the original but this movie was exciting; a good action movie whether the chase scenes had flying cars or by foot. I want one of those hand phones!
1400067820|5.0|This is an extraordinarily stimulating read.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb shares with us the evolution of a perspective on life that moves from the concept of the low frequency high-impact event, the Black Swan, to a meditation on life.  He introduces the concept of the &#34;Antifragile&#34;....systems that benefit from uncertainty and volatility....comparing the fragile systems we routinely encounter in life.....large and complex financial systems, nation-states, and modern life in general with antifragile systems such as biologic systems in general, immune systems, and practical approaches to life.  This book is not primarily financial in perspective although the reader can infer investment approaches Taleb finds palatable and rational.  The focus is on learning to recognize systems that are fragile and distinguish them from approaches that are antifragile.  Ancient philosophies are discussed and antifragile elements of those philosophies are discussed at length...e.g. stoic philosophy.  Modern society, government, and bureaucracy are extensively discussed and contrasted with approaches of personal integrity and &#34;skin in the game&#34;.<br /><br />Taleb ranges far and wide in this discussion...moving abruptly from one discussion to another. The rhythm is staccato.  He has made a real effort to be forthright in his perspectives and speaks from the heart.  His language is at once erudite....bring a dictionary and enjoy his vocabulary...and down to earth.  He calls things as he sees them...in personal ways that are sometimes jarring.<br /><br />I am grateful to the author for sharing his perspectives and discoveries. His thoughts are honest and expose him to a barrage of criticism from those who will be offended...and they are many.  The reader will definitely be enriched by the author's thoughts...and further enriched as the reader's mind will in turn range far and wide perusing life.  An aha for me was the highly antifragile aspect of a loving family.  Each reader will make significant personal discoveries if they commit the time.<br /><br />Prepare to read and reread...learning each time.  This book takes effort...there is no free lunch.<br /><br />Thank you, Thank you....to Nassim Nicholas Taleb
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Couldn't beat the price and how fast it came! Ordered 2 as Christmas gifts for teenage boys. They loved it.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book to see what the hype was about.  It's an easy read.  The characters are not interesting, the main character is weak and irritating, the writing style is horrible.  The author uses the same phrases over and over to describe how the main character is feeling.  It was nauseating to read. I read the first book, now I know what it's all about. I'm not interested in wasting my time to read the remaining two books.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Absolutely love this 2 disc cd set. I love Il Divo's music anyway but this has all the good stuff and more. If you love wonderful voices sung in harmony then this is for you. It gives me chills when I listen to them sing &#34;Amazing Grace!&#34;
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I found this game to be very entertaining. Definitely a must have game. Simple yet very addictive. The levels are very clever and well thought out.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for parents and they loved it.  It was a great price for me and something I knew the parents would love!!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Easy to download,<br />Easy to watch.<br />No problems during either process.<br />Great movie.<br />Amazon does it right.<br />I highly recommend both the movie and the Kindle Fire.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|One of the best free Mahjong games I've ever played. I love my Kindle Fire too!!  I just wish there were some choices for tile style.  I like sound effects &amp; music.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Well, the timing could not have been worse.  ***SPOILER WARNING - ok, so here is this guy that in order to save his wife, he goes around killing children and shoots one that is simply standing right outside his own house.  The kill John Connor back time travel crap is real BS in that is it any surprise that we have these country wide mass shootings?  At one point when the little kid is splattering a guy in the living room, some guy in the theater behind me exclaims, \\"cool\\".  Really? Not horrific or really sad that a kid is doing this?  The old Bruce Willis as is stated, is willing to kill for his wife - yes, he is willing to kill ANYTHING and anyone for his wife.  For his own selfish purposes - not for anything else - not even really for his wife, for himself.  In one scene it is even pointed out that there is a simple way to protect and save his wife but of course no, he wouldn't have any of that - because it was all about what he wanted for himself and HIS loss of her.  Going back to the child killing scenes.  So he knows that ONE of these 3 children is going to do something bad, which means that he is more than willing to kill 2 innocent children to get at this \\"bad\\" one.  When he killed the first kid at least I can tell you that the theater was DEAD quiet.  A lot of these reviews I see happened before the Newtown shootings - so of course the scene was seen in a different light - or I would hope it would have been.<br /><br />I went to the movie because it did look interesting, yet I was not prepared for the total lack of empathy or regard for life at all. It was also interesting to see an NRA scenario played out though, one where almost everyone is armed. A guy steals something and another takes out his shotgun and guns him down in the street.  To some that is all well and good.  Of course discharging a firearm in a crowded street and the possibility of him missing and hitting your innocent wife, sister, brother, etc - is that also well and good?  Clearly society has already run down but guns are not necessarily the way to get culture problems back right again.  Even in the wild west, one of the first things to go when it came back to restoring law and order was to remove all of those guns that people freely carried.  Well, that is a thought for another venue, but movies do bring up ideas and philosophical points of view to ponder, at last they do for me.  Don't assume incorrectly that I'm a left leaning liberal because I'm not.  I own guns but this gun and culture problem we have is more complicated than each of its parts - which is the way we tend to deal with issues - in their parts and not as a whole.<br /><br />I'm not saying that it was impossible to understand the character's position or to care for the different characters that were presented.  That is the only reason why I'm not giving it 1 star.  My main complaint is with the message of the movie and the level of violence.y has already run down but guns are not necessarily the way to get culture problems back right again.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Luv it<br />Can`t wait to read the next two books. Much better than the movie. I would recommend this to anyone.
0525478817|5.0|My older daughter read this book, and told my younger daughter, \\"You HAVE to read this book.\\" My younger daughter read it, and told me most urgently, \\"You ABSOLUTELY have to read this book, RIGHT NOW.\\"<br /><br />But I knew it was a sad book. Why, I asked, should I read a book that will make me sad?<br /><br />\\"Because it's sad in a good way. You have to read it!\\"<br /><br />Well, once again, my daughters were right. This is a wonderful book.<br /><br />It's a book about death that is frequently laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />It's a book about love, and about characters you quickly come to love.<br /><br />It's a book that's over too soon, and that lingers.<br /><br />You have to read this book.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|I was disappointed in this product because when I received it in the mail the plastic casing around the DVD's was completely shattered. When I opened the broken DVD casing all of the disks were loose because the inside of the case was cracked and broken off. There was no bubble wrap or any type of protective material in the thin envelope to prevent this from happening.<br /><br />I had purchased this film collection as a gift, and had to remove the DVD's and put them in individual sleeves. It is unknown to me at this time if any of the DVD's were damaged.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved reading books about heaven and this book was most inspiring because it turned a non-believing man into a believer. He hit the nail on the head when he talked about God's love being attainable here on earth and how we do not need to wait to feel it all around us. The book was a little over my head at times because the author is a neurosurgeon and he uses large medical terminology beyond my scope of knowledge
B008OHV5QO|1.0|The reviews and the info on DVD box were totally misleading. This piece of garbage had a lot of nonsense about  the set-up of performance venue and riding around in a car talking about nothing.<br />And it had absolutely NOTHING of ht esuppose3dly compelling musical performances described. In short: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRAVESTY.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I have been concerned about losing my pictures, music, & docs if my hard drive crashed. With the cloud there are no more external drives-no dvds-no more scheduled backups-no more worries. I now have all my pics, music, docs in the cloud which provides storage and backup for all my valuable files.  The cloud also provides the ability to see any of your files at anytime and anywhere on your phone, ipads, fires, laptops, etc as long as you are in a WiFi area  The cloud drive gives you the option of sharing, printing, downloading, copying, moving your files. Some may find the Cloud a little pricey but if you have or know anyone who has lost their pics, music, docs then you know the price ain't that bad.  I wish the load speed to the cloud was faster because if you have any large amount of files then the initial load time will be very long and tedious. For example, 5 GB of video took 5 hours to load while 5 GB of pics took about 10 hrs.  But after the initial load of all your files to the cloud that should not be a problem as you will be adding small sizes of data. Also would be great if the Cloud drive was available on your tv like Amazon Prime movies so you could view your videos & pics on any tv w/ WiFi & Amazon. Because of the slow speed and not being available for tvs I am giving 4 starts instead of 5.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|You won't be able to put it down! I read this boom in one day.it was well written and wildly entertaining.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|We had been waiting for this book for a while.  Our library had the CD so we were able to read and listen to the story while sitting in front of the fireplace.  Preston and Child miraculously tied the loose ends from the series together...in an exciting and totally unexpected finale.  The authors get top ratings from us.  What fun.  This is Pendergast at his finast.

B007EE4XKI|3.0|The whole back story revolving around Data's creator was so over the top I almost threw the book out a few times but I hung in there and it all ties in to a pretty good STNG story. Makes you want to scream at times. Only a true fan will get through it. I'm very interested to hear other points of view.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|This is another Denzel masterpiece! Another violent movie and exciment and Ryan Reynolds kills it in this action packed thriller!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a totally gripping story about a boy named Charlie and his struggles in highscholl. Charlie is the good guy, yet he doesnt get everything he wants, well not exactly but im not going to include spoliers. I never thought that a book so short could be so amazing but it was. I finished this in less than a day, meaning i started it at about 6 o clock in the evening and then i finished it at 10 in the morning the next day inclusing sleeping breaks. Anybody that is hesitant of this book should totally read it. I reccomend it to everyone!

B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a great movie from my childhood, that is still enjoyable to watch.  I am looking forward to introducing my kids to it.  great 80s soundtrack, characters, plot.  So much fun!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 13 year ild us all about saving the enviorment and recycling! This movie is kinda like Save the World type if thing so perfect for her! My daughter loved this movie! And the shipping was pretty fast! Amazon is doing great things!
B007HACDLK|3.0|I liked the story line, but I wish that they would have left out the language.  Too many swear words and it was not needed to be a part of the story.  It would be so much better without those kinds of words.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|Its a very good app with lots of good features the reason for the low rating however is I began typing to test the app and made a mistake and nomatter how many times i hit the delete button the text did noot go away because of this ill be keeping the app because it is the best there is butis completly obselete
B008F5YDRI|3.0|It was an interesting story line and I liked the idea of what is happening with the moslem world and how this could help them in peaceful times.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game for my son for Christmas and he was so happy to get it. It was a big hit.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Keeps me entertained. Graphics are good. Game does not lag. Lots of levels. Very nice mahjong game. Worth the download.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I must say I  enjoyed this book. My heart broke with Eva and I rejoiced with her as well. No girl can say they didn't feel some of the same emotions she did. The only difference is that unfortunately she acted on most of them. I did enjoy the banter between the couple but the sex over drive rubbed me the wrong way a little as I think it took away  from the substance of their ailing relationship. I am dying to see what skeletons will be unleashed from Gideon's closet as the saga continues. Too bad I have to wait all the way till May
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I loved this game at first but I regret getting it because the whole thing reset when I went to play the game again. All my coins were gone and the hard work definitely didn't pay off. I had so many characters but they dissapeared! I still love it.
B000YAA68W|5.0|I don't know if it was the visuals, or the story that captivated me more, but my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time. I don't think I'll say anything that hasn't been said, so I'll just say this was amazing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love G5 games and this one was no different. Excellent graphics and storyline. Characters were interesting. Game well worth the money. Hope theres a sequel soon. Played on KF HD. HOG are abundent and you do have a zoom option. Never froze. As I said before,cant wait for the next one!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perks of being a Wallflower was great! It kept the reader involved in the story with topics that everyone could relate to. In hope the movie is as good as the book was!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|it is a little challenging. Just enough to hold my interest without stopping. I played I intill I couldn't play anymore than I played it again.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|Not really into sports movies, but this one is really genuine and great story! Samuel L is the best! :D
B0054U53KI|1.0|An great cookbook if you are looking for generic British recipes. However, after being very excited to get this as a Christmas gift, I was immediately let down. This book has zero to do with recipes inspired by the Harry Potter books/movies other than changing some names and the anecdotes accompanying each recipe trying desperately to tie in the theme. It seems as if this was a nice idea for a cookbook that found a clever way to sell as many as possible by piggybacking off of the franchise. I mean, really?: Page 112 Bacon. Step one: put it in the pan. Step 2: turn it and dry on a paper towel when done. That's it. That's a recipe?<br /><br />Will not be recommending.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|Great game, Very addicting, simple layout and easy for anyone to understand how to play. great for all ages. a must try
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Intriguing and I can't wait to keep reading. This is one story that is sizzling hot and leaves me wanting more.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|this is such a great way to save stuff from your PC or Phone and always have it with you where ever you go.<br />Storing everything from Music, Photos or documents. you are never with out those things you need.<br />Safe and secure and so easy to use!!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I was a huge fan of the origianl film, and I had hoped this adaptation would be a similiar experience, and perhaps better since special effects have come so far since 1990. This movie had lots of star power, a huge budget, a promising director, and really great source material by which I mean the 1966 Philip K. Dick short story. With so much going for it I really have no idea where this film went wrong. Starts outs good. It's certainly a nice looking film, great art direction, and good, tight photography.<br /> Say what you want about the original film, some hate it, some love it, but it was a ride. When it ended you felt like you had been on a larger than life adventure. With this film I felt as if I had been promised a ride, but then got lost in a long line waiting for the ride to start, sure I saw the roller coaster go by several times, but I never had a chance to get on. Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be the greatest actor, but he lends himself well to the part of the vehicle character in the 1990 version of this film. Colin Farrel, who is a great actor, plays a character who is a little chuckle headed. He is extremely bored and discontented with his life so he goes to Total Rekall where they attempt to implant fake memories of him being a special agent. After Farrel finds himself deeply emerged in this special agent fantasy he is unwilling to commit to it. When I put myself in his shoes I feel as if I would think either A. I'm a secret agent and a lot of people are counting on me so I need to stop whining and man up, or B. This is all part of the fake vacation which I paid for so I should stop whining and simply go for it.<br />By the end of the film the &#34;Plot&#34; was rather convoluted, and, as Michael Bay has proven in practically all of his films, extra explosions can't make up for bad writing.
B006O3MU96|3.0|If you are stuck at the grandparents this holiday and are tired of hearing how aunt Martha had a hysterectomy and now has to shave her face this is a great game to pass the time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Awesome as always!  Just amazing with all the twists, turns and subplots that it all gels so powerfully!  And so frighteningly possible! Sure hope someone in our government is reading him too!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I first played this on the Wii years ago and still love it! what a great design and fun play. If you like puzzle games like bridge building ect you will love this!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun I love it. and I love the games. get it you'll love it.I love it I got.it wen I was waiting for my dad.
B009FXIICK|1.0|same concept as bejeweled but silly and noisy..I did not care for this game. its been done already, but you don't have to take my word for it.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I think I would have adored this book as a teen, however, as thirty something adult I found this to be predictable and juvenile.  Yawn.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Sure it's predictable, but the musical numbers are fun, it's a nice story, and you feel good at the end!
B0081L391C|5.0|def my type of movie hilarious. have to like goofy movies. lots of known actors in the movie. i recommend
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a must read! I'm not a big reader but decided to relax during some time off with a good book, and I got more than a good book, and I got a book that was so amazing it felt real...and I finished this in 2 days since I couldn't put in down. I recommend this to readers that love a good story.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|it eye candy.  i wish the visual style wasn't so grainy.  after watching it, I read an interesting essay on the web about the connection between this movie and MKultra brainwashing.
B002SR3T10|5.0|You don't need to be a Jethro Tull fan, or even a fan of Christmas, to enjoy this album. It is simply very fine music performed by masters at their trade. The sound is reminiscent of an earlier Jethro Tull, but it so well done that the sound is, well, ageless. The songs, some of them redone Tull classics, are along the lines of the acoustic, folk-rock Jethro Tull of the mid-seventies, but this is no walk down memory lane or a \\"best of\\" collection. The production qualities are superb giving the sound that \\"in the room\\" feel. Don't put this album in your Christmas stack with the Nutcracker, but listen to it anytine of the year, anytime you'd like to hear fine music performed by musicians that know their craft.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It is mostly an intermediate step that allows me to download library books from 3M Cloud.  However, it works very well with no apparent drawbacks.  I have not used it much so far.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Expected a short fluffy read and found more here. After reading 50 shades somehow got led to this book but I wouldn't say they are similar. Better writing, less sex, more blood and sweat.  Still some overuse of certain words. Loved Travis and excited for Walking Disaster.
B008M36EEI|5.0|Another Llasa Hallstrom movie full of heart and wonderful performances from Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt.<br /> Highly under-rated by the movie going public.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|not as good as book 1 & 2 but a quick read none the less!!  The ending could have  been better.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|After seeing the movie, I wanted to be able to listen to it on my new Ipod and this $5.00 highlights download will do until the full movie soundtrack is released.  While it's disappointing that some of my favorite songs are not here, but if they put them all on, no one would need to buy the full soundtrack!  Initially, I was disappointed in Crowe's performance as Javert having seen the musical live several times.  But, after reflecting on the way he portrayed Javert and the way he sings \\"Stars\\" and Javert's suicide soliloquy, I think he was deliberately trying to portray Javert in a more understated quietly obsessed way.  He's not a great singer, he reminds me of Gerard Butler as the \\"Phantom\\", but he's not a horrible singer as some claim and he does brings us a different type of Javert.  While I think Jackman did a nice job in the film, like others have said, it doesn't translate as well on a music cd where you can't see his acting. I wish they would have lowered Valjean's numbers a half to whole step.  Jackman's range isn't quite what it needs to be to sing Valjean in the keys traditionally used. The strain is very clear in his voice on several of the songs that require him to hit high notes like on \\"Bring Him Home\\".  I am admittedly not a fan of Hathaway as an actress and didn't expect to be blown away.  I wasn't, but I did enjoy \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" in the movie although listening to it again on this highlights recording I do think she could have cried a little less and it still would have carried sufficient emotion.  Barks, I remember from \\"I'll Do Anything\\" on BBCA.  I thought she was overrated on that reality show, but I think she does a wonderful job with \\"On My Own\\" and especially in the numbers with Cosette and Marius although her gloriously emotional \\"Little Fall of Rain\\" is disappointingly one of the numbers not on this highlights cd. Sidenote, I am thankful we weren't subjected to Taylor Swift or Lea Michele in the role of Eponine.  Seyfried, while doingwhat she could with the boring role of Cosette, just doesn't have the vocal chops needed to sing Cosette.  Her voice is thin and her vibrato uncontrolled.  The standouts for me were Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit.  The movie really came alive when the band of rebels came along.  I could listen to them both sing all day long, and I admit I've been listening to Red and Black and Empty Chairs over and over on this recording.  I know Jackman and Hathaway are getting all the Globes and Oscar attention, but Redmayne and Tveit along with Barks should be the award nominees in my opinion!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What a deal, price way below any other that I found for the complete set of CD's. The perfect gift.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was hard to put this one down! I wanted the story took continue for another 500 pages, it will be one to 're-read
B0091THDOM|1.0|This is the second item I've received, and for a second time the side stitching is coming undone. Very disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for.
0785163174|4.0|This is a large scope story focused on the return of the Phoenix and what that may mean to the resurgence of mutants.<br /><br />While this is a big story, it's done without the heavy hand of a Civil War, say.  Relatively light-hearted feel especially the backup series which is focused on individual brawls and has fun facts embedded throughout as well as some one page joke fights.  The story moves smoothly forward with the teams morphing somewhat as the power of the Phoenix alters the landscape.  There is a main character that meets his/her demise and repercussions for at least two other important characters as well as one marriage.  All in all a fun, memorable story as well as great battle fun.<br /><br />The only issue is the change in artists in the main story.  All three are well known and respected and talented, but there was no obvious need for the changs throughout the series.  All did well, although I thought Kubert may have beenrushed bait as some of his faces were very poorly done.<br /><br />One thing I really liked was the ability to read this on the Marvel app.  This allowed me toread this on the road withou bringing along a 3lb 5oz book.  It also allows for clean viewing of double page spreads and zooming if wanted - a vary nice bonus.<br /><br />Made a great X-Mas gift.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great suspense, and insight into what it might be like to have your teenager be suspected of murder. Couldn't put it down. Want to read more books from this writer.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Eh, it's ok as long as you're only marginally good at the game. Otherwise there is not much replay value.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very good for what it doesl The app is very visual and most of all free.  Please try it for yourself..
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has a ton of whiplashes!!! Kept me on my toes!!! I loved it!!! The author is so detailed beyond belief one of the best in my book!!!!
B000GKW4HG|4.0|very similar to its original form and is very detail my kids love the gift that I gave to them at this new year eve. thank you papo
B009YP9L7U|5.0|i read it in one sitting, loved the characters and it had a unique twist on a fifty shades type storyline. its not your typical get drunk and get married in vegas story either like i thought it would be when it started. i really enjoyed it.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Well, I did not like this movie as much as The Dark Knight, even though it was a very good movie.  I disliked it for the dark content.  My god, this was a bummer of a movie, but it was a good movie, well-acted, etc.  I was lucky to watch it for $1.99, and it was worth it, but it hurt my soul, a little, for watching it.  Jeez, the people who made this really need some anti-depressants.
0345802934|5.0|I loved this book. I originally got it as an audible and couldn't stop listening. I bought 2 copies of the box set at Christmas time. One for myself and one as a gift. This is the first experience with Harkin Murakami's work. If this author's other works are as good, I may have just discovered a new favorite author.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|It was a great movie.  For some reason, I was able to watch it for only $1.99, and that was the best $1.99 I have ever spent.  You could pay $3.99 for this movie, and it would be well worth it.  (I reviewed &#34;Ted&#34; and told people to save their money on the rental.)
B001DXS4E2|5.0|5 stars to this product, I sincerely enjoyed it. Holiday Inn has always been one of my favorite movies, and I was very pleased to receive such a high quality set of DVD's.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It was edgy, it was a great ride, and well worth the price of the rental.
0486448843|3.0|I bought these to use on postcrossing, but unfortunately I had to trim every single card before I could use it, as the perforated edges don't rip cleanly from the book and make the cards look really cheap.  Big drawback.  After the trim they were perfectly nice looking cards, but having to trim them was annoying.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I like Family Guy.  I like Teddy Bears, even loud-mouthed ones.  I don't like Flash Gordon; never did.  This was good for a movie about a drug-addled teddy bear, but it was certainly over-byped over the last year.  You should watch this when it's $2.99.  $4.99 was too much & so was $3.99.  But it was a good movie; it's just not worth more than $2.99.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Easy to use comes in handy for the kindle fire hd the free one owe great too and it looks cool to
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down!  Very intense…very captivating.  Gives you just enough to constantly need more.  I don't know if I can stand the thought of finishing the trilogy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining.  I love these types of games. Definitely worth the money and time. I can't wait for another. G5 games are great.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Twists are good and keep you reading.  Good entertainment !!!  Need to see what Grisham books i have missed
B0076DELIG|5.0|Expensive for an eBook but you definitely get what you paid for.<br />Fast-paced and intelligent crime thriller. Read it now. A must buy if you're into the detective/crime genre. Harry Bosch is as good a read as Lucas Davenport is in John Sanford 's \\"Prey\\" books; if not better. And more believable. JUST downloaded \\"The Drop.\\"  I think I have a favorite new author.<br />Great. There goes this weekend.<br /><br />Mike Ganz<br />Racine, SO
B007IXWKUK|2.0|3<br />Redmond th th end this  Hecht can f Chen  Chen  Chen  Chinese snobs fondue snob  and so  snacks clubs and Xbox nd
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Don't bother with this one. After you run out of coins you can't restart. you have to wait 30 sec for each single coin to drop. boring
B003O86FMW|4.0|Was only slightly slow at the blogging the it was awesome :) recommend this to anyone who has read the first book
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another excellent work by Grisham. Well done. Fabulous characters. Unexpected twists and turns. Fans of Grisham will not be disappointed.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Falling in love<br />Finding Mr right should be this fast<br />But marriage takes time and work regardless of how much you love the person. This book makes the fairy tale seem realistic.
B00196YNWU|5.0|One of my favorite &#34;old&#34; movies and so glad that my kids now enjoy it as much as I do.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This is a great book for teenagers and young adults. It's science fiction that keeps you guessing with a little bit of romance
B0085YNML2|3.0|Since downloading app my 4 year old grandson continues to enjoy it not boring like some of the others..thanks a lot
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I didn't even read the book I was looking at percentage of course so what about you guys like or dislike?Tell me I needs to know,lol dueses
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the most incredible books I've ever read. It's beautiful in so many ways and also incredibly haunting in the material it covers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS IT WAS THE BEST SERIES I THINK WILL EVER BE MADE!! It MADE me cry and at the same MADE  me wanna scream!! I feel so angry that there isn't anymore hunger games books to read!! I want more!! LIKE AT LEAST ABOUT  KATNISS AND PEETA's kids!!!  WHEN mockingjay was ending it was leading me to believe that everything went wrong until KATNISS killed Coin.... That actually made me<br />feel hope. This book sees to enter my emotions and for some odd reason,  I have a want to be KATNISS Everdeen
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me glued from the start. I couldn't put it down. I love the suspense and the drama that the author entangles in every page. I would recommend this book to all of my friends. I love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless was a great book to read. I couldn't put it down, good from start to finish. I recommend this book to everyone.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game functions precisely as advertised. It is fun, with good graphics and some interesting variations on the jewels. I prefer the variants on Puzzle Quest, in which the game represents a combat our contest, rather than a simple timed effort.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down. Loved it. Would recommend very much for any age. Read in a few days.
B008Y7J3UY|1.0|What an awful movie.  The lead character has no personality and nothing to say.  Graphic violence and topless nudity show up in one scene each just to earn an &#34;R&#34; rating, but add no value to character development or the plot.  Pass on this one even when it's in the $1.99 bin.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose the five star rating for this dictionary. I like this book for its many meanings for a word. I would recommend this book to anybody.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Very quick read kept me interested enough to keep reading on and on till I finished<br />the whole book in a matter of days
B002QP145C|5.0|There aren't many films out on the Russo-Finnish conflict, but this is one of the best. Great acting, realistic uniforms, and historically accurate. This ranks right up there with Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.<br />Just one VERY minor complaint was the English subtitles. Some of them are \\"off\\" a little bit. Not a big deal and certainly not a deal breaker as far as enjoyment of the movie.
B000641D2Y|2.0|Video was wrapped and advertised that it was new yet it was scratched and did not play well.  Was very disappointed.
B0000041XY|5.0|Absolutely fabulous.  The Three Tenors in Concert  is Domingo, Pavarotti and Carreras at their very best.  The beginning ofa ten years of great engagements for them.
B001CC7PKS|5.0|I love this movie, and have since I've first seen it. All I really hate about this movie is the fact that they didn't make a Daredevil sequel. Sure they gave Elektra her own movie but it's not the same.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Some of my favorite actors, but the script was not good and stereotypical.  Sad waste of brilliant actors.  Hollywood needs to regroup and start making some quality films.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Both Cher and christina have amazing voices and it shows on this cd. After renting the dvd iI went out and bought both the CD and the dvd.  I especially like the solo song that Cher does.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great story and totally enjoyable! Josh Brolin as the young &#34;K&#34; did a fantastic job! Watched it twice and loved it both times!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played many games similar to this but none as graphic,suspenseful,fun or as adventurous as this one!my new all time favorite! worth the buy!  It hit on every part of these games I enjoy from the hidden objects to breaking codes and solving puzzles not to mention its a Great mystery! Had tons of fun can't wait for the 2nd to come out!
B005HSL626|5.0|it is a great game. and I believe pepper can love it too. and it is really a good game for ur kids.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I have been doing CFE or some derivative of it for a few months now, but I felt I needed more explanation on the programming and on technique. This book really filled the gap in my knowledge. Though I am having major back surgery next week to repair a blown disc, I hope to use this book to rebuild my endurance athletic career. I'm sure it will become a resource for years to come. Well written and well organized.<br /><br />Even if CFE doesn't make me faster, I believe in its approach to create a more well-rounded, stronger, better balanced athlete, and I definitely buy into the idea that LSD training can grind you down to the nub and leave you burned out and injured. I'm a perfect example: dodgy knee, completely blown out back, always teetering on the edge of total athletic melt-down and sick of spending all weekend on the couch recovering from 5-8 hour runs.<br /><br />Though I weigh a bit more now, due to putting on muscle mass on top and because my back prevents me from training as hard as I'd like, I can't remember when I could do 20 pull-ups in a row or crank out Tabada rounds of push-ups, pull-ups, air squats and sit-ups. Though injured, I still feel like a more balanced athlete heading into my mid-forties.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|was just what it was suppose to be great service came to my door in great time..came to me like it was read new still in plastic and i love the movie no complaints from me
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I heard Tough interviewed on my local NPR affiliate, and I was really interested in what he had to say about the GED vs. a high school diploma in terms of overall success in life. I work with incarcerated adults at a charter school located inside the county jail in my city, and I've often suspected what Tough avers, that a HSD says more about one's character than one's academic ability or intelligence, so I bought this on my kindle on a bit of a whim.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. Tough writes in the engaging and accessible style of Malcolm Gladwell. This book is obviously well researched, and Tough synthesizes his research in a way that is clear and direct. He is also a great storyteller, which makes the book all that much more readable. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It is a good product for people who want to play Angry Birds for free.  Best I figure, it offers just what I need in a simple diversion when I am waiting for something/someone.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I ordered the Season 1 blu ray to see what all the raves were about as I have heard so much about Homeland.  Well, needless to say, I was glued to my TV until the very last credit rolled on the 3rd disc!  What an amazing program!<br /><br />The acting by Claire Danes and Damian Lewis is outstanding as well as the rest of the cast of the program.  The episodes moves quickly along with a lot of things happening but not overwhelming to where you get confused or lost.  Lots of action, suspense and twist and turns to keep you watching ( as I did for several hours) and wanting more.<br /><br />I am now watching Season 2 and the story line just keeps getting better.  I highly recommend Homeland if you like your programs believable, lots of action and suspense and excellent acting.  Programs like this don't come along very often and you don't want to miss this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book. I was very happy with the way it was written and the outcome of the story. Can't wait until all of the movies come out!
B0013FSL0C|2.0|I like the actors and the acting.  But the writing has a reality problem, or else I am not interested.  For a &#34;good psychiatrist&#34; to act out toward his wife is not unthinkable or totally psychotic, but to thoroughly mis-report the event to his own psychiatrist is just a step too far.  So I did not get beyond Week 2.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I love this show and I thought the box set was cute. My discs weren't scratched and seasons 5, 6, and 7 have all worked for me.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|Trying hard to finish this book but don't know why.  Characters are not believable which is an important part of any book that I read.  Book should be classified as Fantasy instead of Literary Fiction. Look elsewhere.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This dictionary is rather nice. It gives great example sentences. It is very cool with it's text speech. Love it!!!!!! :)
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Hadn't seen this is a number of years and was really glad we watched it again.  It was so unbelievably funny and really clean for kids.
B008602KQI|5.0|Selection of cast members is truly outstanding.  The book portrayed the games in a far more gloomy and oppressive manner; however, the movie treated it as more of a challenge without losing the feeling desperation and unfairness.  If one has read the book, then reading between the lines (or better, reading between the scenes) enhances the movie’s abridged script because the character of each individual becomes much clearer.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This movie was fun, thoughtful, touching, and did I mention.....fun!  It's definitely going into my Christmas collection as a movie I'll watch every year from now on.  I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about it.  The artwork makes it as shiny as any Christmas ornament you could imagine.  Spectacular.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|There is a lot of silliness scattered through the movie and the script was  a bit slow at points; however, it has many strengths, too.  The Anime-style artwork is excellent.  I really enjoyed the movie.  I'm glad I bought the video.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|This is one of those movies where you find yourself at a loss to explain your dislike of it in view of so many who simply adored it.  Still, with no intention of dissuading anyone, I have to say I was instantly put off by this cartoon.  It didn't help that I've read the book that supposedly \\"inspired\\" this movie \\"in part.\\"  From what I could tell that meant they only liked E.D. Baker's title and felt the need to make a nod in that direction......buried deep in the closing credits.  I suppose this absolved them of their usual penchant for ruining so many brilliant children's books; it's their forte.  Regardless, I couldn't find much about this movie that I did enjoy, just one song (Dig a Little Deeper), and a couple of fun moments I completely forgot once the movie left them behind.  For me, this movie was unusually dismal, too much evil and way too much spite.  I was totally unimpressed and quickly gave it away, no desire to ever want to watch it again.  To put it bluntly, it was simply a stale recycling of old themes handled in the usual fashion with the expected results, few surprises along the way.<br />Whether it failed to connect with me or I failed to connect with it, the outcome is still the same; I didn't like it.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|Funny, good movie for family.  Rodrick rules in this one.<br />Better than 1st movie.  Shows a good side of<br />family coming together.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Tooo many ads and pop ups when opening for me. I am sure if i played it would be fine; however, never made it to the game for the pop-up/ads. I was not sure what I was clicking and my luck I would okay they charge me money.

B005LAIIQC|1.0|Time to hang it up on this series....even the killing and action had no direction.  Paid $22 for the Blu Ray, not a good investment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I finished it in 24 hours. Loved the characters and the unpredictable story; kept me on my toes.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|No boring parts. Kept you guessing.  The characters were interesting and familiar from previous books.<br />Great read whether it's your first Clancy book or 10th.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|What can i say that hasn't already been said, this movie is awesome, it's a classic. this version (widescreen collectors) is great for the price if you are buying it for the first time but if you already own the movie this has nothing new really
1616614609|5.0|Richard Garfield, designer of Magic: The Gathering, has struck gold again. In a game of hackers and evil corporations, the complexity of this game grows tenfold. However, once you break the rules barrier, this will be one of the greatest games you ever play. It feels like a game that will be talked about for years to come as a masterpiece. I recommend it for 14+ hardcore gamers.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I've been reading mystery's and police procedural s for fifty years and I must say that the &#34;Harry Hole&#34; character, as delineated by Jo Nesbo ranks very high in my estimation. Although this is the first book in the series, I've also read the two latest ones. They were all very satisfying, rich in characterization, plot and setting. A must read for all who love a good mystery, worked on by a fascinating character.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love the game fun to play makes u think about how many different ways you can connect the dots
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|Great family & holiday movie. The blue ray film quality is beyond excellent. This is one of my kids favorite movies... A great movie for a fire, popcorn and huddling up with your kids on the couch : )

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I first played it on a friend's phone and had to get it on my kindle. I love playing it.
B004ZJZPWA|5.0|this movie is certainly perfect entertainment with a lot of CGI and action as well as some thrilling and also romantic moments.<br />One wonders why they did not plan a part 2

B002UD56I6|3.0|Well, Michael Jackson died too young. he was not only a good dancer but also an artist who understood how to entertain his audience.  this movie is okay to watch but i like to see him the way he was before and rather watch his videos or tour shows on DVD/bluray. The documentary is lacking the real story.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I have recently watched this film, for the first time, on DVD the other day. And, the first overall impression was that it was \\"rushed\\" somehow, plus a lot of things in this film doesn't seem to make any sense. However, it's good for entertainment.<br /><br />Personally, I would prefer to see this film under James Cameron's direction.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|there are many people that commented on that prequel to the alien universe and I agree to most of them. the movie is very good, developes a good story and has some great effects, especially in 3D. Michael Fassbender earns an oscar for his great performance. However, this movie bring s up a lot of questions unanswered and I would have loved to see some of them answered. Who are the engineers, where do they come from and why and how did they fit into the alien world.<br />We will see more in the sequel.<br />It is a good movie and could have added another hour easily.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|I have watched \\"In Time\\" on DVD a number of times. At first glance via the trailer, I figured it would be just one of those sci-fi action flicks. Big deal. But then, I saw that it was written, directed, and produced by Andrew Niccol, who also did the films like \\"The Truman Show,\\" \\"Gattaca\\", \\"S1m0ne,\\" and \\"Lord of War.\\" So, I gave it a watch-ahead.<br /><br />It takes place in the year 2161 when a genetic alteration has allowed humanity to stop aging at 25 but the people are required to earn more time after turning 25 or die within a year. \\"Time\\" has now become a world-wide currency. There is something called \\"Living Time,\\" which can to be transferred from individual to individual. And, one can see their own time's availability as displayed on an implant on their arms. So, when that clock reaches zero, you die instantly. The more \\"time\\" you earn, trade, or even steal, the more you survive. You have to \\"pay\\" with your \\"time,\\" such as a bus fare, a meal, a rent, etc.<br /><br />The society appears to be divided based on how much \\"time\\" you have. The rich have more time than the \\"poor\\" whom have to live day to day to keep earning \\"times\\" or they would die. The rich of course just live their life without worrying about dying and plans to be \\"immortals.\\" You can live up to 105 or 2,000 and still looks like 25.<br /><br />There is an interesting catch phrase in this film where a \\"rich\\" character has said to Will (played by Timberlake): \\"For few to be immortal, many must die.\\" That, to me, implies a huge \\"time\\" or energy drain from the \\"poor people,\\" who had to die, so that rich can live forever. In the \\"poor\\" areas, the prices has been increasing enough to the point that the people cannot even pay anything with their \\"time,\\" so they'd died. The more they die, the \\"rich\\" endures. That is what Will do not want to have happened - so he sought out to \\"drain\\" the immortals from their \\"time\\" and distribute it among the poor (and of course collapse the \\"System\\" in the process).<br /><br />This film has that somewhat a typical theme such as hero meets the girl, they are being chased by a bad guy (Timekeeper), who didn't win in the end (there is a twist in this regard), and the hero and the girl moving on together to rob more \\"Time banks.\\"<br /><br />It may have been based on some science fiction novels or elements, but I've found this film to be interesting. The lesson is, of course, don't waste any \\"time\\" or letting others to waste/steal yours.r /><br />This film has that somewhat a typical theme such as hero meets the girl, they are being chased by a bad guy (Timekeeper), who didn't win in the end (there is a twist in this regard), and the hero and the girl moving on together to rob more \\"Time banks.\\"<br /><br />It may have been based on some science fiction novels or elements, but I've found this film to be interesting.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|$33 for 8 blockbuster movies? Wow! Talk about savvy shopping. My Christmas gift price range is about $25-40, and this fit the bill quite nicely.<br /><br />After it arrived, I was surprised and pleased that the movie case was not a foot wide leviathan, but quite slim. Not much bigger than a standard movie case. As this was a gift and thus unopened by myself, I do wonder at how well protected the DVDs were, but oh well. For the price you saved in buying these together you can buy whatever DVD case you desire.<br /><br />5 stars!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|After watching this film, I found it to be \\"okay\\" and an interesting story.<br /><br />It is more focused on drama than on the alien monster and there was, of course, the \\"suspense.\\" The plot was interesting and focused on Joe (the boy) and Alice (the girl played by Elle Fanning) and there was a tension between their fathers due to the death of Joe's mother. It's more about family issues, young love, and friendship while there's alien monster running about the town in the background.<br /><br />I felt that there should be more to the relationship between Joe and his father and something has been neglected somewhat there. However, the novel romance between Joe and Alice was very good and tender.
B009KNPPS0|3.0|I have been a Clapton fan since '66 and have owned all his music -<br />even the stuff I didn't especially feel that good about.  This is<br />a classic album - but $95!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No way.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|I just watched this film, \\"The Adjustment Bureau,\\" the other day.<br /><br />I gotta say that I do enjoyed watching it. I think this film did an okay job in presenting our reality, dynamics of our lives, and an illusion of free will. It was mainly interesting to see these MIH (Men-in-Hats) making sure that certain individuals are doing as according to \\"The Plan,\\" especially the one who is a politician (thus gives a suggestive of politicians being puppets of higher powers, well duh, not the first movie on this).<br /><br />The one scene that interests me was where David and Elise is at a restaurant and MIH guys were trying to make several changes to avoid having David and Elise to experience their \\"Kiss.\\" I was half-expecting a sense of \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\" to show up in this scene (where a change in program to occur like \\"The Matrix\\" film) but what did happened was that these \\"obstacles\\" was placed on them, to instill an increased \\"sense of urgency\\" in both of them as a result of the changes, to \\"nudge\\" them to go to their \\"fixed\\" directions. Also I really thought the \\"door\\" thing was very cool.<br /><br />However, I'm not too crazy about the ending of this film as it felt \\"corny\\" in some way.
B008G12ERC|3.0|I like this band, however I was a little disappointed with this cd. It was good but not as good as other cd's by Muse.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Recently, I just watched this film, which was okay and can be enjoyable. But it was not as great as I would like it to be, and it's almost mindless. I felt that this film was too \\"rushed\\" and the plot wasn't carefully done. It, however, has that CGI thing going on with alot to see (which seems to be the good thing about this movie, if not only).<br /><br />After having been a collector of \\"Green Lantern\\" comic books as a kid myself, this film is slightly a disappointment because it doesn't really live up to the lore.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Bought this movie for my daughter and it was great! Very cute and sweet and recommend for children and adults!
0316228532|4.0|Recently, I have read this latest book by J. K. Rowling whose \\"Harry Potter\\" works were absorbed by everyone a world over. \\"A Casual Vacancy\\" is profoundly darker than the \\"Harry Potter\\" series and seriously not intended for children.<br /><br />I even felt rather nerved while reading this book. And, while reading this book, one can forget that this is the same author who wrote the \\"Harry Potter\\" series, or so I think. Personally, it was really a struggle emotionally reading through this book as it has so much profanity and explicit imagery almost on every page. Admittedly, this book is not my favorite of her works, but it has some interesting pathological insights and shows the worst aspects of ourselves as I think it's a good portrayal to that respect.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this cd. I don't typically like this type of music, but after listening to the whole cd, I really like it a lot.
1400069289|3.0|I have recently finished reading \\"The Power of Habit\\" to which the author, Charles Duhigg has discussed the patterns of habit and how it works from individual to companies to societies (three parts of this book). And, I'm glad that I've only read a library copy.<br /><br />To be fair, it is a good book on the subject. It has excellent anecdotes, examples, and stories to support his thesis (but there were holes in few places), however he is really covering an \\"old ground,\\" so to speak. It lacks insights or any eye-opening \\"food for thoughts.\\" When I read first few chapters, it was very interesting and with lively stories but then, the author have a \\"habit\\" of rambling on with very little usefulness.<br /><br />The book breaks into three parts:<br /><br />1) \\"The Habits of Individuals\\" - where habits are being discussed and why we have them and how they work.<br /><br />2) \\"The Habits of Successful Organizations\\" - how companies or business utilize knowledge of habits and habit changes to their success or failure. The author used an example of Starbucks coffee shop where they utilized LATTE method to be drilled into their employees that contributed to the success of the company.<br /><br />3) \\"The Habits of Societies\\" - how habits are understood in a social context (\\"social movements\\" where habit changes to meet their needs with examples from the 1960's Civil Rights movement). Then, the author talked about our responsibility for our habits (with inclusion of an example of a man who killed his wife and claimed to be innocent by blaming his habits).<br /><br />I am more inclined to feel the first part of this book to be worthy of read, but the rest have weak points.<br /><br />Habits or behaviors are nothing new to me as we would know them as \\"programs,\\" etc. But, in this book, \\"habits\\" are seen in a negative light (i.e., smoking, drinking, weight loss, destructive behavior, etc.) and they can be changed. However, the author was not very clear on how to \\"cure\\" them yet he was right on knowing how they work first before going about to change them.<br /><br />Then, he discussed the positive aspects of having habits. While reading that part, it feels like I'm reading about the unconscious processes and the positive dissociative states (but he didn't use these terms). Driving to and from work without thinking is a good \\"habit.\\" That habits serve a purpose: to lessen a cognitive strain on the brain. Our brains crave habits or a strong need to normalize. By normalizing our ways of doing things, we require less energy for our brain (cognitive ease) and less thinking. This made me think about our recent era where we are machines of habits to the point we require less thinking/energy (Imagine what we could have accomplished if we gone the opposite way: no habits and more thinking/energy).<br /><br />The author also explained the process of habit: a cue-routine-reward model. Of course, this is nothing new. There is a trigger that initiate the \\"start\\" of the routine where we are engaging the \\"action,\\" and the \\"pleasure\\" we will get from that action. Then, the loop starts again. Thus, a habit. The author has pointed out that a habit can be changed by changing the action or routine that one does while keeping the same cue and reward as the original action (that is, unwanted or destructive action). Personally, I don't agree with this argument since it's basically a transfer of \\"forms\\" of the same habits.<br /><br />I think since we are creatures of habits in this world to which we have little choice to be, we can simply observe the \\"cue\\" that triggered our habits and what we get out of that (what kind of pleasure? What is that reward?, etc.) and make a choice to either give in to that \\"cue\\" or not. When we don't repeat that cue, we'd likely to end up with a different habit that may or may not fit to our current goals or \\"aims.\\" Say, precipitation by reading books or procrastination by watching television? Either you use energy for learning or lose energy by \\"escaping.\\"<br /><br />I chose to read this book because I was curious and it was relevant to my current unlearning process. What got me through this book were the stories and interesting examples, and the author tend to be persuasive (with backing by recent cognitive science researches). It turned out to be a disappointment and yet it is driving me to read more on the subject.ose energy by \\"escaping.\\"<br /><br />I chose to read this book because I was curious and it was relevant to my current unlearning process.

Whether you're preparing for high school, in high school, or feel like reminiscing over back when you were, I think you'll find this book enjoyable. Doesn't deserve anything under five stars. (:

B00979CS50|1.0|Listening to to 28 minute tirade as the first cut on this latest release from Neil Young is similar to reading the first 28 pages of a book where each page just repeats itself.  I had to suffer through it all just to see how long this piece of crap lasted. From a musician with the history and pedigree as he has, I am thoroughly depressed.  If this is an example of what he is doing as a result of giving up the drink and the drugs, I say go back and start smoking the weed Neil.  Whatever you had is totally missing me on this one. A few redeeming guitar riffs can be found on some of the shorter cuts but please Neil, you are capable of more than this.  The drumming sounds are simply boring and so amateur, I can't believe what I'm hearing.  Plain and simple, I found this CD to be the worst Neil Young release ever.

0756404738|3.0|Finished Wise Man's Fear last night on a note of frustration . . .<br /><br />Let me start by saying that there is a lot to recommend this book. Mr. Rothfuss's prose is so effortless, it's easy to overlook how deftly he shows Kvothe's character through dialogue and interactions with other characters. He delivers some suspenseful moments, and elements of his world-building are pretty creative (for example, the warrior tradition of the Ademre).<br /><br />But, in my opinion, WMF is fatally flawed by his indifference to plot. **Minor spoilers ahead** I started in on this tome thinking that I would finally get to see Kvothe make some headway in tracking down the Chandrian. In fact, that plot line inches forward and Kvothe never pursues the goal with any real urgency. He picks up the quest and leaves it as whimsically as he dabbles in his various romances. This is perplexing because Mr. Rothfuss is such a master of the other elements of writing, I can't imagine he doesn't see (what I think is) the void in his story.<br /><br />A good example is Kvothe's budding romance with a character named Denna. On one of his quests, Kvothe finds out that she's in danger. He becomes emotionally distraught. But does Kvothe rush off to save Denna? No. Instead he takes a detour to a remote corner of the world to learn a new skill, forgetting his anxiety like it was a bad dream. I'm left thinking, maybe he didn't love Denna that much after all.<br /><br />And that's the sense I got from the story in general. Kvothe has abiding short-term interests, but no lofty goals that he's dying to achieve. He wanders in and out of experiences (I can't call all of them adventures) in the aimless way that most of us live of our lives, with no prevailing, earth-shattering goal. But what makes stories interesting is when characters are larger than life and their aims are momentous.<br /><br />I also have some minor quibbles with Mr. Rothfuss's world building (basically, that most of it is a bland, standard medieval fantasy land), but I could overlook that if Kvothe had a deeply held goal and struggled mightily to achieve it. Sadly, I can't see myself slogging through the next novel and another 1000-pages of a-day-in-the-life of Kvothe.

I am impressed by the author's ability to create such a complex web of relationships in such a gripping way. This book will make you laugh, cry, and analyze your own life. Wonderful character development and storyline. Will definitely be reading more of Hoover's work.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great casual game.  No need to buy extra coins to enjoy it.  Even waiting to get your extra coins adds to the excitement.
B008QMMEOE|2.0|There are only 4 puzzles with this app before you have to purchase more, so calling it a free app it deceiving. There should be a lite in the title to indicate such. My toddler got bored of the 4 puzzles in a matter of moments.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I don't know what I was expecting but with all the hype I didn't think it was a movie about children murdering children, a little strange for me.
B005LAII12|4.0|Funny, but raunchy movie.  Wouldn't advise for young teenagers even with parents supervision. Not what I would consider good role models.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My hubs & I rented this movie & it was such a great movie we had to watch it again
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I received the tiny bluetooth iPod transmitter as it was supposed to be from the vendor.  I was satisfied with the order.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Read some of the other Lincoln Lawyer books and this was on par with the others.  Good read, twist at the end.

B000SW4DXK|4.0|While the original 1947 movie is still the best...I believe this is the best remake, at least in my opinion.

B005DOL0R0|1.0|The zipper broke within 1 hour of my daughter opening her gift.  Might have been useful otherwise.  Fairly soft sides but attractive.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is one of those books that you can't put down.  A gripping account of life in a North Korean prison and an inside look onto an isolated country under the control of a brutal dictator.
0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals describes how President Lincoln leveraged his former competitors' skills, experience, and political power to save our nation.  This is an easy read that all will enjoy.
030758836X|5.0|An excellent tale.  Although I (and most of my book club) really disliked the 2 main characters by the end of the story, it was really well done.  To say more would give away the story.  Enjoy.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Haven't had any trouble with it at all I use it all the time. Every night in bed reading it works great,I can play my games,read my books,prop up & get cozy under my covers and read away.<br />I love Amazon. Use it for all my shopping for books and accessory.<br />I also had my kindle fire quit, called and theyd told me they would send me a new one, in a couple of weeks .<br />I told the nice lady on phone I didn't think I could wait that long, & I used it every day and I got my replacement one the next day, plus it was easy to send the broke one back !! I love Amazon, and they didn't tell me to say that.thank you Amazon.Edith.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really good book! I'd seen the movie before reading it, but the book still was able to suck me in.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|The movie has a few slow points however the story line is good. I've watched it about 7 times and each time &#34;Mr. Big&#34; jilts Carrie, I cry.  I've seen the second movie, too, but don't recommend it.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I expected it to be decent but was surprised by some of the way's that it took. Overall better than average.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband loves this as much as the kids.  I don't play games like this but they all seem to think it's the best game ever.
B00129H7VS|4.0|just fantastic all the way around, funny, suspensful, action-packed...its a great show and is very entertaining. I definitely would recommened.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was awesome. It was well written. I can't wait to read the second one. I hope it will be good as the first one.
B000P0J024|5.0|The DVD with this set makes it worth the purchase alone.  To watch these great musicians work together is wonderful.  The music videos are good, 2 in particular are very good.  It is too bad that Rory Orbison passed away during this time.
1449433251|4.0|The books are a great read and are nicely organized by sections. However, the books are heavier than they look.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Nothing more to say but this game is awesome!  Once I actually played it I loved it! Its a Friday night and I'm in the house playing this game!! Love love love it!
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL was recommended to me by several people I trust, and let's just say, I am quite thankful. The book is a mystery-thriller, so I feel that any plot synopsis would contain at least one spoiler and I would want people to read the book as I did, with absolutely no idea what might happen. Obviously you know the title of the book. That is the only hint that you need. The book is so cleverly written, full of honest McGuffins and sly prose, that the reader is taken on a tremendous journey. It is one of those rare books that you want to read at stop signs, if you know what I mean. It's a shame I can't tell you more about the story of Amy and Nick and their journey from New York to Missouri, but I really think you should discover each plot point for yourself. After you read it we can discuss why not five stars.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|The movie is clean and fun, though it is very sappy. It has some interesting twists and character development. Fun to watch  but won't buy.
B007H9B6KA|3.0|I would not characterize myself as a Garbage fan, but I own their other CDs, and I enjoy their hits when I hear them on the radio.  This CD did not meet the standard set by their previous albums - in my opinion.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|This item provides an excellent way to be able to use an Ipod or GPS while taking longer motorcycle trips.
B008FOB124|5.0|I love this album.  I've played it almost every day, since I received it.  Usually I'll listen to it a few times in a row.  I never get tired of it.  It's that good.
B000EXZI0K|5.0|These songs were listened to so much when I was a teen.  I'm glad to have it in CD form now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was good on its own merit. It has a strong plot and excellent introduction and development of new characters. The pace is fast and keeps you wanting to turn the page. The imagination of the author of the new horrors in the arena is impressive. As it is the second book in a trilogy, I can't wait to start the next book.
B0063TX06I|5.0|This CD reminds me of a long ago Christmas morning when I opened my gift and found a Bee Gees album I'd been wanting.  It's great!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Christian Bale is the best Batman . The Dark Knight Rises is definitely the the best of the three movies .
B000EXZI1O|5.0|I love listening to songs that take me back to younger days.  I have this in record form and now as a CD.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Disappointing & not funny like the previews show.  Meryl Streep is always an excellent actress, but this script wasn't consistent in the story line & did her no justice.  Seemed awkward & the ending confusing...what the what?
0385416067|5.0|Re-reading these stories years later they have lost none of their wonder.  Some of the stories might seem dated though the bulk of technology is simple and understandable as the stories are not hard science sci-fi but more people oriented 'what if' sort of questions.  This volume is also a perfect collection that just seems to flow so well together.<br /><br />My favorite has always been stories of the multivac.  Read 'The Last Question'.  Amazing story of multivac through the eons of human expansion.  This is a must read volume for even casual fans, well worth the price if you can find it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I find my self completely and totally unable to stop myself from wanting to read more and continuously eager to find out if Christian and Anna will get their Happily ever after!  The first book left me heart broken for Anna and needing to know if they would be back together and be okay it took me 7 days to read it. Book #2  I purchased on my Kindle Fire and found myself reading at every available moment.  I wouldn't put it down.  Now 48 hours later I've finished reading it and I'm struggling at the hour it is not to download the 3 rd book right NOW!  Oh please<br /> E.L. James tell me that they live Happily Ever after!!!!  Ana and Christian are amazing together!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The dvd was fun to watch.  I love animation and watching these kind of dvds with my granddaughters.  i would recommend highly

B001NT057K|5.0|I love that kind of music.  I thought it was great and the sound was awesome.  I would suggest this to any<br />music lover.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can you say....Downton Abbey is the best.  I look forward to the new season every year.  To have the opportunity to watch it over and over is wonderful.
B00APO6K5K|1.0|I hope CBS is donating proceeds and using their ability to use the media to help educate and come up with solutions to help the people of Newtown and prevention from further violence in the US
B001RTSPVY|4.0|My husband told me about this movie, and wish he could find it somewhere. (he does not do computers) I just went to Amazon and there it was. It was a happy surprice for him.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Can check the weather and forecast if planning to travel.  It is fun to see the weather in far places where there is family or friends
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You don't have to be young to enjoy an honest and beautifully written story! This was one of those books I hated putting down, but dreaded being finished.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great movie....funny story line and great music.  It did have some bad language but overall.  I am glad I purchased it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun and easy to get started and play. Download was very fast. I am not a big gamer, but i really like it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i love this game ! it has great graphics and fun puzzles ! I enjoyed the story line too . lots of fun !
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I bought this for my husband. It is an awesome movie. We have watched it quite a few times. Not for everyone though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy this app! Relaxing way to sit and pass time while waiting for appointments or long car rides. My 7 year old really likes playing it as well.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Its good for anyone who likes puzzles and who enjoy a good puzzle every now any then it Finnish to do a puzzle for myself I like puzzles.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is an addicting game. A little eerie for children.<br />It has a good story line and enough interaction to keep it interesting.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Like the movie and would recommend it to friends, can hardly wait to see the next one when it comes out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is great! I couldn't put it down and just when I thought it couldn't get any better there would be another scene that would top the last.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I have seen this movie more times than I can count. It is well acted and beautiful! It is the best movie portrayal of Bl. Pope John Paul II out there! Be sure to have your tissues handy. This man's life is unbelievably inspiring!<br /><br />Don't settle for less than this one. And watch the sequel!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Get yours too and have a Glee parties with your friends.  This is the complete second season, careful as you select which version you are getting.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I take it all back. This app works wonderfully! I managed to fix my video recording problem and now everything works fine :) The added timer camera update is a great bonus to. I would like to point out that it is not the apps fault that it can only take front facing pictures. I am very pleased with this app and it is well worth the money :)
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This is a well crafted movie--good acting, editing--but it is the same basic story line of the first two Bourne movies, i.e. two attractive single people together fleeing from relentless assassins.  However, in contrast to the other Bourne movies, there is no higher purpose here, no nobility in the main character, and no justice given towards the dastardly higher-ups.  And ultimately it is this failure that makes the movie an unsatisfying viewing experience.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|I am unable to rate this item as the DVD was stuck in the case. Efforts to remove the disc proved fruitless, the disc finally cracked and unuseable
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I was skeptical on whether a collaborative effort on a true Clancy novel would work.  It does.  Threat Vector is typical Clancy, well written and nearly impossible to put down.  I'd recommend it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like facebook a lot, and enjoy being able to get it on my Kindle Fire. Facebook is the best place to text family and friends.  The kindle is just the right size too.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|its fun there's multiplayer and classic buy it please get it if you can do it now or else. o
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down, finished it in one day!!!! I will definitely be reading more of her books!!
B004FHP9KA|2.0|I found the movie to be very confusing from the beginning and never really understood what was going on.  I would have to watch this movie over and over to figure it out and I don't like to work that hard at a movie, I want to be entertained.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's such a relatable book! Extremely interesting. I think it definitely is worth the money. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|There is a creepy overtone to this flick, you feel very bad for the characters involved.  However, that is what makes it good,  The re are a couple of good performances by Woody Harrelson and Liam Hemsworth that compliment Jennifer Lawrence, however, she steals the show.  Kept me in the movie until the very end, I enjoyed it thouroughly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book indicates that it isn't fake. This stuff happens in The world. And we need to do all we can to stop it. This book....is real.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've read all oh his books he never disappoints. If your a fan this is anther must read, five stars
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I cried. This book kept me on my toes and was a bit suspenseful and touching. Amazing.<br />I definitely recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I actually sat here all day and watched every episode... Keeps you wanting more!!!! Too bad we have to wait until February.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Quick simple action games that are entertaining enough to pass away the winter boredom blues. Some more challenging than others but definitely worth wasting your time on.
B002GIBVV6|4.0|This collection of music from the movie is very nice.  It is very relaxing and brings back memories of scenes and images.
B000R8YC18|5.0|THANK YOU ALL VERY-VERY-MUCH! You ALL hopefully will have a wonderful, profitable up-coming year???? Loved seeing all those &#34;scenes&#34; I did not remember even &#34;seeing&#34; the one time I saw this at it's &#34;premiere&#34;!!!

Thanks anyways-Happy New Year to ALL of you that make the &#34;company&#34; function soo well !!!!!
B0034G4P4Y|3.0|It is a joy to watch such a quality semi animated/live movie and see my childhood hero in a full length movie.<br />Teh ending left me &#34;empty&#34;
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Some movies conduct business on more than one level. For example, \\"Groundhog Day\\" is seen by most as a cute 7-star comedy as indicated by the majority of comments I ever hear about it. But there is also a minority, myself included, who see it more as a film about philosophy that explores interesting \\"what if\\" questions, like what if you had forever to turn yourself into anything you could possibly imagine? I don't know which was the filmmaker's intent, but that is what I have taken away from the first time I saw it, and what has been reinforced over the dozens of times I have watched it since. In the same light, there are many who will see \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" and conclude it is another long-hair art-house documentary about sushi. Again, there is a minority that instead will believe what they have seen is a privileged glimpse into an exceedingly rare level of excellence... and passionate unwavering dedication... and scholarship... and the extraordinary work that can be accomplished by relentless consideration of what you do and how you do it.  Like Groundhog Day, I see JDOS as being much more about philosophy than being about just what the camera happens to be pointed at while the ideas are being explored, and that it succeeds so perfectly on this higher level, that I must conclude that the latter was the filmmaker's intent from the start.<br /><br />Jiro is an 85 year old man who has been a sushi chef since he was a young apprentice. He operates a very small but world-renown sushi restaurant in the Ginza section of Tokyo. The film attempts, successfully I think, to give you an idea of how Jiro's craft evolved to where it is today... not so much by showing you a digest of his accumulated methods that comprise what might be called his mastery, but by exploring how he thinks about it and how that differs from the way the rest of would. The films reveals a singular, all-encompassing dedication to the perfection of his craft that is simply awe-inspiring and will quickly cause any Jesuit to feel like a slacker. It reveals a practitioner who has personally transcended the superlatives, acknowledgements and awards though he has been declared a Living Treasure of Japan and holds a highest possible Michelin rating of three stars, among many other honors. It reveals a man that continues to work to understand and achieve perfection with every tiny act. JDOS is about the pursuit of excellence... not about how to make sushi.<br /><br />The nature of excellence, as well as the tools to understand, recognize, and cultivate it have been increasingly at the core of my own philosophical interests over the last decade or so. For example, seeing the commonalities in how a Julliard musical prodigy and a world-class police motorcycle rider.. or the world's greatest sushi chef.. think about and pursue advancing their respective crafts is fascinating on its own, but also I think, instructive in improving at my own pursuits. Anders Ericson's work on giftedness and expert performance, echoed into the mainstream in Malcolm Gladwell's \\"10,0000-hour rule\\" for world-class expertise in \\"Outliers\\", is a connection I think some will make to JDOS. The research indicates that most world-class practitioners, from Olympic athletes to leading neurosurgeons to everything else strongly tend to have at least 10,000 hours of hard practice behind them. Like the sign just before you board many amusement rides, It takes this much to be \\"world class\\".<br /><br />While such people are both rare and extraordinary in what they have achieved, as I get older, the idea of what 25,000 or 50,000-hour expertise can yeild and where it may be found is even more riveting. Simple math, and the underlying story from JDOS lead me to conclude Jiro can correctly be considered to be at least a 50,000-hour practitioner... beyond \\"merely\\" meeting the definition of world-class, and I stand in total awe. In Groundhog Day, the circumstances of Phil Connors life... repeating the opportunity tofurther refine who he was.. ultimately yielded an unimaginable ability to contribute to the day in which he was stuck. It all came from the evolution of his point of view over an unknown but very, very long period of time... at least decades, maybe thousands of years...who knows?  I think Jiro is as close to a real-world Phil Connors as I will ever know of, and that is meant in the best possible sense. I want to know more.<br /><br />Because of this, I feel this film has value beyond \\"just entertainment\\" or art. I don't think an everyday outsider can truly see a craft the way a dedicated practitioner sees it, or even how to move toward it if they are interested. But they can get little insights.. glimpses... clues... behaviors... points of view... standards... confirmation that they do think about their work differently, and maybe even show you a little of the flavor of some of those differences. A real-life, late-stage Phil Connors would be an amazing advancement of uncommon high-road post-Jesuit human pursuit... an invaluable example for some people to understand if they existed beyond the realm of the thought experiment. I feel this film documents that point of \\"what is possible\\" and a little of how it's possible, from which those who are inclined toward excellence can experience that truly invaluable take-away. The effect 90 minutes of exposure to Jiro's belief system could be at least called usable encouragement, and quite possibly mentoring.<br /><br />Having said this, JDOS also works as a film... I never noticed the movie-making decisions/execution, or the selection of content or the pacing. I just noticed Jiro's philosophy, and for that, I must give enormous credit to the film maker. He got out of the way completely and let Jiro and his philosophy exist without the distraction of film-making. I can only imagine how James Cameron would completely and thoroughly butcher the subject.<br /><br />Before I saw \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\", 5 of the 630 movies I have rated carried 10 stars. Now there are 6. I have always held a special reverence for \\"On Any Sunday\\"... I consider it to be the most important film I had seen in my first 50 years for the extraordinary gift of a life-long passion it bestowed upon me. I live a richer life everyday because I saw it. Again, I am fortunate to have encountered a film that can affect my life at that level... I think Jiro is the most important film I've ever seen since OAS in 1971 because of how it it clarifies and reinforces some of the most important philosophies and ethics I hold. It's not for everyone, but for some, it will be amazing.further refine who he was.. ultimately yielded an unimaginable ability to contribute to the day in which he was stuck.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|This SD card adapter was shipped promptly, and it's a great adapter to have for the iPad. However, my old camera uses a memory stick pro duo, and requires a small adapter to turn the camera card into an SD card. The card adapter wouldn't fit into this 13-pin to SD card adapter, which was unfortunate. I place the blame on my card adapter though, because it should've been made to fit any SD card slot.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Outstanding sound quality.  Blows you away!!!  The base, the depth of the sounds is absolutely great.  Worth every penny.  Makes games come alive.
0812993357|5.0|I have always loved and admired Grace and her creativity (way before the September issue film). I have read Vogue since as long as I can remember and Grace brought a breath of fresh air to the magazine! This was such a interesting book and a very fast read.<br />I loved learning that Grace loves my favorite restaurant-Hatsuhana and will never cut her long hair just like me :-)<br />I highly recommend this book for any one who loves Fashion as it gives a wonderful insider look into the Fashion industry!<br />I only wish it was longer!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love to play this game. some are harder than others but its enjoyable and I am happy I downloaded it.
B000UR9QIK|4.0|After watching the Blu-Ray version of Dawn of the Dead, all I can say is it is a cornucopia of 70's cultural artifacts as well as a brilliant example of good B-Movie production.  This is an important distinction to make, since much of the legacy of the horror genre was laid by filmmakers who had very tight budgets and therefore had to deliver their shocks and screams through creative use of editing, makeup, and unvarnished dialogue.<br /><br />In theaters this movie was among the most shocking, and gory films I'd ever seen.  Mind you, a middle-school student in '78 would have been very hard-pressed to find anything so gory, but in Blu-Ray the special FX show in bloody detail the limits of what latex flesh, rubber limbs, pig intestines, and colored dye packs can do.  For an aspiring film student, the very evident reveals of these limitation fills the mind with how any creative teen could cobble together a workable film with similar story, set, and effect elements.<br /><br />However, in my opinion what really makes this film shine are the cultural overtones which make it very obvious how our world has changed in the time since the original theatrical release.  Keep in mind, in 1978 the modern enclosed indoor shopping mall was a relatively new creation.  The idea that four survivors of the zombie apocalypse would hold out in a shopping-mall, where food, clothing, in fact nearly all necessities of life are readily available was in itself a stroke of writing genius.  When one of the characters states after wondering aloud why the zombies were congregating around the mall says, \\"They're after the place. They don't know why; they just remember. Remember that they want to be in here\\", we can see an early observation and possible indictment of our growing \\"consumer economy\\" based on conspicuous consumption - it was so important to the living that even the dead come back.  Walking Dead holes up in a prison, Dawn of the Dead holes up in a Mall.  Both are makeshift \\"fortresses\\" that are well provisioned and defensible, but Dawn of the Dead allows us to explore our id-driven impulses of looting and survivalism in one place!<br /><br />There are other great examples, such as the line heard from an off-screen Television an expert/pundit says, \\"This isn't the Republicans versus the Democrats, where we're in a hole economically or... or we're in another war. This is more crucial than that. This is down to the line, folks, this is down to the line. There can be no more divisions among the living!\\"  Wow, fast forward to 2012, and it's comforting to know the current problems in Washington DC were alive and well (over similar issues) 34 years ago!<br /><br />And let's not forget the soundtrack!  Cheesy synthesizers that could have easily been lifted from Tom Baker-era Doctor Who episodes!  People forget that back then it was a very \\"modern\\" sound, used throughout TV and film of that period rather than the more expensive orchestral scoring that preceded it.  The musical score is another prime example of why film students and movie aficionados will enjoy watching this film.<br /><br />It's also amazing to see the ugly design standards of the late-70's on full display.  One can tune in to \\"That 70's Show\\" on one TV and flip back and forth between the two and the authenticity of the sitcom is obvious, from the hair and makeup to the furniture and fashions.  The cultural DNA of that decade is everywhere and is both laughable and nostalgic at the same time.<br /><br />And without giving any spoilers away, the final scene with Peter making his last ditch effort to escape - and the final lines of fluff dialogue - again classic<br /><br />The special features are less than stunning: we get a fan-video of the Monroeville Mall, some trailers, a couple of \\"behind-the scenes\\" videos of the monster FX, etc.  Buyers can therefore consider the purchase/rental of the downloaded/cloud-based version of the Blu-Ray, but in the opinion of this reviewer - ownership has it's own special pleasures, and no self-respecting fan of the zombie/horror genre should be without one!
B001N26GFM|2.0|The ending IS HEART-BREAKING and lingers with you for a long time after watching it. (Maybe I'm just too sensitive(?). It went to an area thrift shop after two watchings.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I would read it again, and again if I could.<br />It is worth the time, and I wanna read the next one.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because the book is really funny and Jeff Kinney explains what is going on so you really know what's going on in the book. The only thing that I don't like is that sometimes it gets off track and it dose not make sense. But overall the book is really good so I think that you should get this book
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What would appear dull, is not at all. There is NEVER a dull moment on Downton Abby. I have to say that I am disappointed that those who order the show streamed to their laptop do not get some sort of discount on the price. If you save Amazon money while decreasing your &#34;carbon footprint&#34; you should be rewarded...monitarily
B00APUYN0I|5.0|The movie was very funny and it was a movie we watched as a family on Christmas day with our adult children.  It gave us all a break from the holiday bustle and we actually watched it twice1
0345803507|5.0|Do not understand why I love this series, But I do. I guess it's like slowing down for a car crash. You do find yourself rooting for these people. Maybe it's the way he takes care of her. Every woman's dream. Never happens.
B000W15AQ6|5.0|Awesome music!  No surprise from Eminem!!!  He always moves the bar no matter how many albums he produces there is always something new!!!
0345803493|5.0|Had to jump out of bed and run down to order books two and three when I finished book one. I really do hope she writes a second trilogy. Was disappointed that she skipped over the whole wedding and dove straight into them being home with kids at the end of the last book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So far this story is excellent.  I will have to update later on to accurately portray the story.  If it's like the others it will be awesome!
B0034G4P26|5.0|This is a great animation in the tradition of Wallace&Gromit, Chicken Run etc. The storyline is great and there are a lot of funny details in the scenery which make it worth to watch it multiple times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books were recommended to me by a friend and so glad to have read it.  Awesome twists that will suspend.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I always loved the comic books and I had reservations about watching this movie, but it totally blew me away. Great action. I think one of the biggest challenges was filling the gaps that naturally occur in a comic book when making a movie and they did a great job. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Don't buy the PS3 game. That is bad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This will keep you on your toes.  I am so glad I read this one.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This is such a great movie, great storyline and great acting. I totally got back into loving Woody Allen movies after this one.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I wanted to get these for my husband for Christmas but didn't want to pay so much for the brand new ones. I found this one gently used and in perfect shape! Thank you!
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I would say probably the best science fiction movie of the last 5 years. I like the storyline. Great acting.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|the only thing I do not like about buying MP3 on amazon is that the quality is not the greatest. I like to hear my MP3 at least over 300kbps and they only let you get it at 256kbps but the kids love it anyway
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book first grabbed me by the authors ability to capture the feelings of young love. She brought back memories of my young love back to life  with every great detail in what it feels like to fall in love, then when least expected the story turns around into the story of fate, hurt, betrayal, and coincidence. It reminded me a lot about my  childhood and love with my high school sweetheart and now husband and father to my son. The author surprised me when least expected and  couldn't put the book down.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it and I chose this rating because it was really entertaining.I liked the book . I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You have to get this game. Very amazing. Not much to say, because it's so awesome! Love, love, love it! I'd give it a million stars if I could!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Anyone who wants a twisting heartbreaking novel This book is the one. Jodi Picoult goes from a story about cancer to a story about family. Truly a great book.
B000MGB6M8|3.0|The movie was ok, I like much better in Gia, now that was a great movie. But it was good enough to watch
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was awesome. I have all the books in my room but I think this book and cabin fever are good ones.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I know most people love this book...but going through a horrible time of domestic violence with one of our family members...just found it in bad taste.  Not a prude...love a good romantic, sexy story!  But this one just had me think of our family's experience and couldn't even finish it.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I love the advice in this book. I didn't realize that when I don't look at people in the eye, they take it the wrong way. But I hate looking people in the eye! I get way scared of being judged, and I have irrational fears of people..... but I will work on looking at people in the eye! Because I don't mean to make people feel weird, I hops this book helps!!
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Who doesn't love Toy Story?  This was for my grandson's viewing and gave me a little quiet time with him.  Whew!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|It makes you smarter and teaches you about strategy so if you like things like that then your perfect for this game but the keyboard part is annoying foe me
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|this s*** is so funny.  yes it has alot of voices from family guy.  mila kunis is a goddes. love you mila
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book changed my life and I hope it does the Sam  for many other  my age. I highly recommend it.
030758836X|5.0|Do yourself a favor read this book. The criticisms I have read are just readers who don't like a book that ends without the normal bad guy gets it in the end. Best twists and turns and brilliant psychopath villain ever. Trust me, READ THIS BOOK.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This was a really good movie based on a true story. The depiction of the characters is well done, lots of drama and action. This is a pretty violent movie so those with youngsters may want to view this film after the kids are in bed!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I heard the new Musical Movie with Hugh Jackman and Ann Hathaway was coming out and I wanted to find out what the story was about first. I couldnt put the book down until I was finished. I was enthralled.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Not my favorite and this one was not up to his usual standard of excellence, but enjoyable none the less.
B0053KWDES|2.0|The sound is ok, but i only realized after purchasing this that i can't have it connected to external power and use it at the same time (the sound is turned off while charging). This made it useless for the application i had in mind, and it would have been perfect otherwise.
B008LV05EG|5.0|very happy with this purchase of a hard to find item, not available in local stores glad to find it here
B005IQZB14|4.0|I liked reading this book for both the descriptions of the hiking and for the personal experiences before, during and after the hiking.
B000TU16GS|5.0|Great book. I love this series. Great plot and ending too. I will most definitely read the rest of the series
B002O5M4SA|1.0|I can't believe the high reviews this film received. I'm a fan of both Reno and Danny Aiello but this film from the ridiculous beginning until I had to turn it off midway through was horrible.<br /><br />The meeting between Reno and Aiello at the beginning was childish; and the action sequnces where Reno acts like Spiderman and kills a good half dozen armed thugs was ludicrous.<br /><br />This film couldn't make up its mind as to whether it was a spoof of gangsters, or out and out sci-fi.<br /><br />Save yourself the time and money.
B002ZG999U|4.0|this is not an award winning movie, it is just fun and the guys had fun making light of themselves.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|This was a very well done movie.<br /><br />What kills me though are the comments from the 'free-marketeers'.<br /><br />Who feeds these people their scripts? They've obviously never tried to deal with the markets.<br /><br />Since the begining of time people have gamed the system to their own advantage. Most big time traders look for whatever edge they can find to control markets. None of these people want a free market, hence their collusion to control it and maximize profits. Granted some financial regulation is clearly misguided, but it pales in comparison to the fraud that exists in the 'free-market'<br /><br />And as far as derivatives are concerned they were completely unregulated by the clueless one...Alan Greenspan. It took the reality of a market meltdown to awaken this fellow from his ideological fog and finally admit that he \\"made a mistake\\" in trusting the markets to regulate themselves. I mean this clueless ideologue didn't even want to prosecute outright fraud because he believed - another of the right wing true believers - in the ultimate self correction of the 'free market'. (Notice how Greenspan refused to comment.)<br /><br />Truly, the free-marketters live in some enchanted never-never land where the tooth fairy reigns supreme...and keeps those 'free markets' running smoothly.
0783225482|5.0|This movie portrays perfectly the vanity of women and the desire of all man kind to live forever. It is both funny and romantic yet has so many unexpected twists.....an oldie but a goodie
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Cool game, but it won't let me finish the story, not sure why. It stopped when I was about to save the girl, which was disappointing, wish I could keep playing.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Splash is a wonderful tale of a mermaid falling in love with a land walking human. She meets him first as a child then again as an adult. A must see movie
B000008JUM|5.0|silly question.......if it wasn't what I wanted I wouldn't have ordered it......how do you &#34;rate&#34; that?.....and whats this need for so many words, whats that about?
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|great graphics.  easy to use.  got it mostly for my mom, who is 82 and it's worked out great. she enjoys it.I started playing this game and it is addictive. I like the pace, fast or slow, however way you play. I would definitely recommend if you like these mahjong types of games. if you dont play and want to know what it is,it's a matter of choosing free matching tiles. must be free on one of its side. definitely worth trying it out.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|I have played this game on the computer but the Kindle edition was only 3 levels.  After that they want you to BUY the next edition.  Shame on you for offering such an inferiour edition of this game.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Igave this as a Christmas present and they are still trying to work their way thru it and loving every minute!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I'm using the compact chimney starter to start the minion method on my smoker. Just it awesome i need to get another one.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|it would not work on our new kindle fire hd.  so dissappointing  We need it to get onto a kid website cause this was my daughters Christmas present.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It is kind of like the story games but it is still good.<br /> This game is good , not great but it is still good.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Several months ago, I downloaded this app hoping for a simple sound machine that I could use when traveling; it has exceeded my expectations. I own a sound machine and use it every night, but the clarity of this app is excellent and is better than the one I own.
B009ZE27US|1.0|It never gave you your age. Everytime you tried it it would give you a different age. What a RIP!
B005ZUR724|1.0|please gameloft may you let the game run like it would on an apple product. Order fans hate that they can't okay the game because gameloft can't update it. fix thissssssss!!!!!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|You can't help but fall in love with the main characters in the book.  It's not about the sex but the story behind it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I will say this book did start out a little slow, but not for long . What a great combination of suspense and love story. Can't wait for the movie!
B000U0F7RG|1.0|The item was a Christmas gift and was unfortunately missing the 5th disk of the first season.  I would like to exchange it for a complete series.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I loved this movie! I'm not generally a fan of movies many would consider \\"chick flicks\\" - but romantic comedies (heavy on the comedy) can be a lot of fun. Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds and Bettie White - along with many, many others - make this an enjoyable movie. Like many in this genre, it is not terribly complex - rather, it's a good movie when you're looking to relax and not put a lot of brain power into your evening entertainment. If you're looking for a cute and fun movie to relax with, this is a good choice!
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|Thanks you so much I added more to my collection since thank you again have a great holiday thank you
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|This movie - which I have thoroughly enjoed watching multiple times - had pretty much everything I could ask for:<br /><br />- Action: Lots and lots of action scenes that are very well done. Also, many explosions...<br /><br />- Great Cast: Although some of the cast is slightly older than many of the current action stars, they do a superb job making this a movie which exceeds many of the recend action-genre releases.The characters were all well written and defined, with many developing well through the film.<br /><br />- Humor and Fun: While not a comedy, the actors and writers managed to work many humorous and quirky scenes or lines into the movie.<br /><br />- A Plot: Yes, this movie has a plot...not only that, it is very well written and developed.<br /><br />This is one movie I added to my collection as I know I will watch it over, and over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While reading a book it is rare for me to feel the urge to return to it just to check in with the characters and see how things are unfolding ... that urge to return to the book despite other pressing matters that may be going on in the \\"real world.\\" The Wool series, however, is precisely the kind of story that draws you in and makes you turn the page in anticipation. I have been disappointed lately with authors overselling characters, overwriting scenes as if they are poets, and generally writing as if they are paid by the literary flourish. This author, Hugh Howey, has figured out how to precisely measure the need to develop a scene and the need to remain silent and let the reader imagine the scene. To my mind, this the true measure of an author.<br /><br />More precisely, I love the creativity in the Wool series (from the creation of the larger storyline involving the post-apocalyptic world ... to the vivid description of discharged air bubbles forming under the winding staircase in the deep down). Howey manages to provide the perfect balance between providing enough detail to make everything come alive ... and allowing the reader to imagine the world of Wool from his own perspective. I've completed #5 and I am hooked. It's the best set of novels I've read in a very long time.<br /><br />I hope he continues writing so I always have something great to read!!
B002ZG980U|5.0|For a long time, I wasn't really a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. Then, two movies changed my mind: this was one of them.<br /><br />The movie follows a complex plot involving individuals who can go into, and even create or alter, the dreams of other people. The cast for the movie does a great job and the special effects are extremely enjoyable. I would recommend watching it when you can pay close attention, as the various levels of the plot have the potential to be hard to follow if you miss something.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it is the best it always has a twist ending and keeps me on the edge of my seat
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Considering these reviews are looking for a customer's opinion of the product, I am going to share what I liked about the film (as I greatly enjoyed it), then I'll finish up with reasons I think it may not be for everyone. Of course, some of the things that I like may be things that other viewers dislike - that will be up to the individual. Hopefully, this will provide information for those of you reading it to make an accurate decision on whether or not to buy/watch the movie.<br /><br />What I liked (please keep in mind that I have not read the book or seen alternate versions of the film):<br /><br />- The story was complex: There was a detailed, complex and well developed plot to this movie. Much of the plot is expressed in the large amount of dialog in the film, so be prepared (I used subtitles just to make sure I didn't miss anything - but I almost always do that). If you are going to watch this movie, plan to play close attention so you don't miss important details.<br /><br />- Great cast and characters: Characters were well developed and changed (for better or worse, depending) as the movie progressed. The actors, as well, put a lot of time and effort into ensuring that they portrayed characters well and they did fantastic jobs.<br /><br />- Terrific score: While in many films, the score seems to be almost an afterthough - something you don't necessarily notice - it is extremely well done in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />What some may not like:<br /><br />- There are rape scenes in the movie: While quite disturbing, they were a small part that I felt the rest of the movie made up.<br /><br />- Violent: There is a fair bit of violence in the movie. It didn't bother me, but it may potentially bother some viewers.<br /><br />- Very dark: This is not a happy, feel-good movie. I thought it was a very good movie. But it is not somthing that I would recommend if you're looking for an uplifting film. This movie deals with mental illness, murder, rape and many of the darker sides of human nature. Again, I felt this potential downside was outweighed by the good plot and characters, but for some it may be a reason not to watch the film.<br /><br />- Long movie: The movie is longer than many, which may just mean a bit more planning to ensure you have time to finish it.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />I completely realize that this movie is not for everyone, and I understand the reasons behind this. Personally, I really enjoyed the film - but I know many who absolutely hated it. I hope that this review will help others to determine which category they will fall into before either dismissing too soon, or watching something that they may potentially hate (or find upsetting).nd many of the darker sides of human nature.

B003H9MSPG|5.0|Nice all around Nerf Gun. If you like nerf, you'll love this gun. If you hate picking up nerf darts, you may want to pass on this one. It is a nice gun for the advanced nerf shooter.
0374275637|5.0|This book will make you reconsider your decision making processes. A very thought provoking book. I am really enjoying reading it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard of it but didn't think much of it. Got it as a gift and I couldn't put it down. Every page has excitement in every way.  For those with weak mind I have to say read at your own risk
B007EECSFA|5.0|One of those books you are glad you read. The characters come to life and you feel you have known them always. So many times throughout I just knew I had figured it all out that big secrete but it isn't until the end it all falls together and no one is more surprised than the reader.  Curl up with a nice cup of tea and enjoy one of the best books you'll read in a long time. And one you won't soon forget.
1451695195|5.0|Received this on the day it was released. I have always been interested in the afterlife. This book provides increased credibility as it is written by a neurosurgeon. Stereotypically, I believe neurosurgeons are not oriented to spiritual answers to medical issues. Alexander gives a compelling story of is &#34;near death&#34; experience. Fast read and will leave you thinking.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|While this book is aimed at the late teen, it's a truly  adult examination of the human psyche and how it reacts to extremes of violence and cruelty. The dystopian future Collins portrays is close enough to our current predicament to be believable. Her use of the first person (present tense) to tell the story is both intimate & revealing.
B0029LHW68|5.0|This for me is their best album, went to see them in concert and was not disappointed.  The music makes me sing along, and this is war I can put on repeat and listen to all day!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Loved the movie and the soundtrack is awsome, very upbeat and fun. Would recommend this album for the holidays or anytime.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is the most amazing book I have ever read! Two thumbs up! This book intrigued me from the start. I recommend this book to everyone I know! I will be reading the rest of the series can't wait!!:)
B007GFDVEE|4.0|Bought this as a gift for a 7 year old who has had previous lego experience. This was a little more difficult for him. The coloring similarities seemed to make the instructions hard to follow. But with some adult help we finally got Captian America up and running.
1449410243|5.0|People who hang around with cats know that these relatively small predators have a warped sense of humour to go along with their tremendous egos. Oatmeal puts in all in perspective, outlandish perspective. Even my dogs were howling with laughter.
B00138EX88|5.0|Mariah Carey is at her best, with songs that inspire and motivate you.  Her voice is outstanding. Some are older songs but still terrific.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a fantastic book. It took me 4 days to finish. I saw the movie first, normally I can't go back and read once I've seen the movie version but it was easy with this story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent in every way - particularly the creativity in how the book is structured and the duel narrative.  Worth all of the praise!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|After the initial shock value of a bong smoking teddy bear wears off, Ted gets old quick. A tired story line of guy has girl, guy loses girl to buddy, guy gets girl back. It's an ok movie but not really that funny.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|When Grisham moved from being an attorney into a legal thriller writer, it was clear he had some deeper goals than just writing escapist yarns.  However, those days of The Firm and The Pelican Brief are long over.  Initially, exposing the ills of our broken justice system, Grisham has now stooped into the greed pool of preying on the readers to keep buying his books over and over, in hopes that he will write again from his activist sensibilities instead of following the same formula for sales,  His books have become an insult to his followers.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|I seem to get lost within the game and it is not fun when that happens.Am new to kindle and that could be a factor
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I was hoping for a polt or some decent acting. Quite disappointed. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This book was terrible. Was really disappointed. I was over 80% into before Reacher even got into a fight. Seemed like it was written to make a deadline. One thing for sure, Tom Cruise could play Jack Reacher in this book...unfortunately
B0094BB4TW|2.0|There are people on face book that claim to be friends..I don't have a clue as to how that happens.  With my &#34; real friends &#34; if I have the need to catch up, I will call them.  So, while I do go to face book it is not something I enjoy.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|this includes all songs from the original Twlight saga from the first movie, and is exactly what it says it is

B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Anything, any story on Pope John Paul II is worth reading and/or watching in my opinion.  This one is good, but none of them quite do justice to this man ~ put them all together and you might, might begin to understand the man Karol Wojtyla.  Definitely worth the time to view then share.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like it its probably my favorite book! It will make you laugh! Or at least it made me laugh :D

B00APUQT7I|5.0|My entire family lived this, think this has become our new Ice Agecream favorite! Once again, this series does not disappoint!
B005LAII12|5.0|Loved this movie and have watched it about 4 or 5 times already.  It has 2 versions you can watch, the theatrical version and the unrated version with content not seen at the movie.  I recommend the theatrical version because the unrated version keeps content in it that really don't add anything to the movie.  Mark Walhberg is great as always!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I love this book. I love the young/old guy. I love that its written in first person. I love his relationship with his dog. I love that it's fast paced. I love this story.
0553103547|5.0|I bought the whole 5 book series for my son for Christmas.  He was very happy!  He watches the HBO series and loves to own hardcover books and will read them over and over.  Good prices and just what he wanted.
B000W1VDEY|5.0|Okay, first things first: If you can't handle Geddy Lee's high-pitched singing in Rush's early years, this album will probably sound like fingernails on a chalkboard to you.<br /><br />For the rest of us, this is exactly what Rock & Roll was meant to be. Released in 1974, Rush was often called the \\"Canadian Led Zeppelin'. Well, this blows anything Led Zeppelin ever did away in terms of sheer in-your-face power Rock & Roll. This albums smokes from start to finish, and it's made all the better because the band had already perfected these songs on tour and they recorded it themselves to their own standards. In that regard these songs are perfectly executed. My God, just listen to that guitar and bass work. It's just astounding! Remember, stuff like the Bee-Gees was dominating the radio around this time!<br /><br />Sure, John Rutsey isn't as flamboyant on drums as Neil Peart. But his garage-style playing fits this album better than Peart would have, in my opinion. (I'm a drummer who can cover Peart's work pretty well, by the way, and I'm not at all offended by Rutsey's performance here).<br /><br />The lyrics are not what we normally expect from Rush, since master lyricist Neil Peart had not yet joined the band. And yet, through all the \\"Yeah baby\\"'s you can tell this is a band that takes its craft seriously. \\"Here Again\\" may be my all-time favorite Rush song. The intro to \\"Before and After\\" may be the most beautiful thing Rush has produced until the last song of their most recent (last?) album (\\"The Garden\\" on Clockwork Angels). Rush's ability to arrange songs has obviously been one of their greatest strengths, even before Peart joined. Adding Peart after this album just helped to improve perfection.<br /><br />Rush's catalog is too extraordinary to choose a \\"favorite\\" Rush album. But this is the one I turn to most often because it just plain ROCKS! Get it, give Geddy's voice a little respect, and just enjoy it!
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Good book and can easily get you hooked on Follett. I read his Fall of Giants and Winter of the World before this book and grabbed it while waiting on the third book in that series.<br />I would recommend it.
B000JJS8TM|2.0|I picked this up after hearing the Strawberry Fields remix at a coffee shop and finding that pretty well done. Overall, the whole production is interesting to hear, but it just isn't up to snuff in terms of remixing. Some of the transitions are shockingly disjointed and make me cringe in disbelief, while the entire mix seems \\"forced\\" in a way that makes me uncomfortable. A couple places have some really annoying sounds in the background. Not because they are different than the original; they are just annoying sounds in the context where you find them.<br /><br />With all due respect to George Martin (and boy does he ever deserve respect!), I think he should have left remixing the Beatles to the professionals in that genre. I've heard far better remixes of the Beatles than this, but no one else will ever hear them because those producers can't afford a million dollar's worth of lawyers to get it distributed to the public according to the RIAA's gangster-style terms and conditions. (Though it will be perfectly legal for their grandchildren and everyone else for eternity to do it once the copyright runs out--makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?). So I have to recommend that you just purchase the Beatles' albums, instead. (Purchase them all, only Yellow Submarine is not an exceptional album).<br /><br />Even the artwork in the large pamphlet is a pretentious attempt to be artistic. I don't need Photoshop filters turning John, Paul, George and Ringo into amorphous blobs. They deserve more respect than that. These guys were master craftsmen. I want to see them at work. All of this adds up to a feeling of exploitation, which doesn't make sense because I would never expect George Martin to exploit his unique role in the Beatles.<br /><br />On the bright side, everyone is correct that the sound quality is superb, the best I've ever heard the Beatles sound yet. The song selection is excellent, though it leans heavily toward their later era (Sgt. Pepper onward).<br /><br />I bought the version with CD and DVD, and the DVD turned out to be just the same music as the CD in surround sound, Dolby, etc. So that was entirely pointless for me. But that's my fault for not leaving the record store to check a website first to make sure that the Digital VIDEO disk contained video. My bad. Oh well, there's another ten dollars to help finance the RIAA's habit of filing lawsuits against grandmothers, children, and deceased pets.<br /><br />A group as extraordinary as the Beatles deserves FAR more than this pretentious nonsense.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The book caught my attention til the last few chapters, I expected more plot twists. However, an overall good story.

0143039431|4.0|This was the first book I have read of John Steinbeck's, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Steinbeck writes with a simple elegance, while telling a sad, yet compelling story about struggles through the Great Depression.<br /><br />In The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck uses a peculiar combination of diction. Overall, the book seems very conversational. Steinbeck uses very simple words, with the occasional large word thrown in, with a folksy sort of feel. His use of simple diction makes the book extremely understandable, in turn making it more relatable as people tend to relate to things they understand.<br /><br />To get more specific in areas concerning diction, I'd like to discuss the diction used when Steinbeck includes dialogue. In the dialogue, Steinbeck's grammar is atrocious. Words are left incomplete, sentences unfinished; the grammar is just awful. However, this does not detract from the appeal of the novel as would be suspected. It instead enhances the appeal of the book by making it more realistic. The way Steinbeck shows the way people would have talked in the era of the Great Depression. Personally, I quite appreciate Steinbeck's efforts to make the novel as realistic as humanly possible.<br /><br />The other aspect of Steinbeck's writing in The Grapes of Wrath that I came to really enjoy and appreciate was his use of figurative language and imagery. Steinbeck does a phenomenal job painting a picture in the readers' heads. He uses very detail oriented style, full of very rich adjectives.<br /><br />While the adjectives do more to fill the role of imagery, Steinbeck has an incredible talent in his use of figurative language. I found one of his favorite figurative language devices to be the extended metaphor. In one of the between chapters (the broad chapters, that aren't character specific) almost everything was an extended metaphor, and everything was being compared to one central thing. Everything was compared to a monster; the bank, the tractors, even the guys who drove the tractors were all somehow made out to be a monster. Even in the chapters that were character specific, Steinbeck loves his extended metaphors.<br /><br />Steinbeck uses these devices, and many others, to create what is a literary masterpiece in my mind. An important story was shared with the many people who have read and will read this book. It is a book that can be read multiple times and a person wouldn't tire of it. Steinbeck's use of simple, detail oriented diction creates a wonderful base on which to build such a story.<br /><br />This being the first of Steinbeck's works that I have read, I have been thoroughly impressed and will continue to read novels written by him. The Grapes of Wrath tells a phenomenal story in a simple fashion that is so incredibly understandable, and relatable, that I found myself completely drawn into the story; after the first 150 pages or so anyway, which I found to be a bit slow. Even so, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, understandable book to read.who drove the tractors were all somehow made out to be a monster.

B004DSX5B6|5.0|It has every tool you really need out in the wilderness. The knife was already pretty sharp. The pliers work well and do not feel like cheap product (of course not as good as regular pliers due to the handle form factor). The best part about this multi-tool is the ability to lock the tool you want, which allows for great stability.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this trilogy. I got very sad when it ended. I would've liked that the part when Peeta and Katniss grow close again would be more descriptive, she took less than a page talking about it. I was interested to know see how after everything that happened to them they are together again. Overall this trilogy is the best I've read. I highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait for book 3! Very well intertwined with book one, and a great set up for a great third book
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have tried a few different battery apps and in my opinion this one is the best! Worth the money.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was well written! I absolutely loved it. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance with a little kinky side.
B000ME5B30|5.0|It's pretty interesting how this movie covers the american car industry in 2005.  In retrospect they should of used that as a warning to make more fuel efficient cars before their collapse in 2008.  A lot of people that say global warming is a hoax should really look at the data and listen to the scientists.  Opinions from big oil and right wing media have been discredited as junk and has no basis in science
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not a big reader  but got a Kindal for Christmas have heard this was a good book so I gave it a try. I enjoyed it to the point that I could not put it down. I will have son read it as well.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|EDGE is an incredibly special game. It's a subtly colorful game in it's own little way. It is essentially a 3D plat-former puzzle game, but the beautiful cubist art style is what really makes this game special. It is mostly black, white and gray, but the little cubes you find around flash rainbow colors and you, a larger cube, also gives off subtle, ever-changing colors. The simplicity of the color in this way never makes you feel overwhelmed by to much color, or underwhelmed by to little. Sadly, gameplay is where EDGE is lacking. I played this game on my Kindle Fire, and i would occasionally find that the cube you control wouldn't respond to my movements correctly. This wasn't too frequent, but it was a pain when it happened. My biggest problem with the game was when you first start, expect to be a little frustrated. It is kind of diffucult to get the hang of. Once you do get it, it is truely fun and addicting. All in all, this is a beautiful, challenging puzzle game in the wake of Cut the Rope or World of Goo. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This movie is amazing!!!! I could watch it over and over! Best movie I've ever gotten...! And it's Michael Jackson my all time favorite singer....! R.I.P Michael &#60;3

B001EOOQEM|5.0|Love, Love, Love this album.  If you like Heavy Metal you must own this album.  Its so heavy, and its one of those great albums that will take you to a land of witches, fairies, demons, & angels.  Iommi guitar work is amazing, and so is Dio's soaring vocals.  Ozzy Osbourne is amazing (saw him live in 2010, still awesome even in his 60's), but personally I think the Dio fronted Sabbath was the better band.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
0553801473|4.0|I must admit Martin is not my all time favorite writer and these are not my all time favorite stories but he and they are in my top ten list and who knows with his next book it could move him closer to the top of that list.
B000NA77YO|5.0|This is a coming from a guy who owns every Ozzy Osbourne solo album, as well as most of his music while fronting Black Sabbath.  I bought this album basically because I had a couple extra dollars in my pocket to spend, I never knew that 5 years later I would still be enjoying it.  This was my very first introduction to Dio fronted Sabbath, and I recommend it to anybody who wants to find out what was so special about Ronnie James Dio.  The guy truly was magic, his lyrics were great and his vocals were off the charts.  Sabbath was just a different band when Dio joined it, I personally prefer Dio fronted Sabbath, its just so heavy its like musical ecstasy.  This compilation is so loud, it will break glass cups or cause any nearby picture frame to slide off the wall. Favorite tracks: Neon Knights, Lady Evil, Heaven & Hell, Die Young, Voodoo, and After All (The Dead).  God bless you Ronnie James Dio for giving us this great music, may you rest in peace.  We promise to keep rocking!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have loved this story for years and years, have seen at least six movie versions and three stage productions.  As a lover of the story and each character's struggle through the story this movie version was fantastic.  I felt all the passion and pain and this movie had a grip on my heart that I won't soon forget.  Loved absolutely loved Colm Wilkinson as the priest, a wonderful tribute and a few others I noticed too.
B001EOOQF6|4.0|Absolutely love Dio fronted Sabbath, not that I dont love Osbourne fronted Sabbath as well.  Its just an entirely different sound, when Dio joined not only was the lyrics heavy but the whole sound finally changed into the heavy metal music we all know and love.  I personally prefer Heaven & Hell, but Mob Rules is the more complete album.  I really wish Dio and the rest of Sabbath members would have made more music together!
B00821OW8K|5.0|Did not have any expectations at all, just watched because I had nothing else to watch. It kept me entertained and kept on getting better and better as the story unfolds. I love the characters and how the mesh together. Great syfy flick with lots of action.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This is what my 12 year old grandson wanted for Christmas.  He loves it.  The darts have some force behind them so is not good to shoot as other children.
B006H5120E|4.0|Now this doesnt have tons of in your face 3D action, but it has lots and lots of depth, that puts you right in the movies. Stunning. Not to mention a great movie to back it up. If your gonna watch this movie, watch it 3D, for sure!

0316776963|5.0|FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY, I litterally laughed out loud uncontrollable, throughout the book. One the the BEST books I have ever read, and funniest. True stories of a wacky family. All his books are wonderful and hilarious. Get them all, this is my fav one.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This is great to hold the Knex toys in as well. We have 2 of these and they store a ton of toys!
1465001123|5.0|Who doesn't like Taylor Swift?  This is a great item which contains typical photos and calendar-related events - just as a calendar should.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I know this is a classic, and I understand the value of a female writer at the time, but I found it, at times, hard to follow the characters.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I bought this from Amazon for $5. That alone made it worth it. It was easy enough to find a few songs that would have easily added up to more than $5, so buying the whole album was a no-brainer.<br /><br />If you're well versed with the musical Les Miserables, then this may not be worth buying. But...if you've watched the movie like I have, then this soundtrack may be a wonderful memento of the movie...at least until the DVD is released or a complete soundtrack is released (it's egregious that \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" and \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" are not considered to be highlights). What makes this soundtrack so unique is that the sound captures exactly what was heard in the movie. So, you hear all the imperfections on the recording that you heard in the movie. This could drive you crazy hearing the same \\"mistakes\\" or you could really appreciate it for exactly that. That is, the soundtrack is no different from what we heard in the movie -it wasn't recorded again for the soundtrack.<br /><br />I won't go into each song, but I do have thoughts on several of the songs:<br /><br />(1) \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\": Duh. Anne Hathaway's performance was awe-inspiring. After hearing about her performance ad nauseum in the media, it was great to watch her performance in the movie, and it lived up to the hype. I thought Ms. Hathaway really captured what Fantine was experiencing and you could feel the heartbreak (or her heart break). I think a lot people can sympathize the anguish of Fantine if even generally, and Ms. Hathaway's emotive power in the song really captured all of it. When she gets to the line \\"Life has killed the dream I dreamed\\", I was there. All there. And I was all busted up.<br /><br />(2) \\"Suddenly\\". This was the new song written for the movie for Hugh Jackman's character. As a song on its own, it is okay and nice. It has a nice melody that fits in well with the rest of the musical. It's as if the song was always part of the musical. However, I should point outthat this song when sung in the movie brings out a whole different character to the song. In the context of the movie, the song is beautiful, tender and poignant. It's as if all of us are Cosette's parents totally understanding the fears and anxiety of Jean Valjean. So, thank you to the composers for this new song.<br /><br />(3) \\"In My Life/A Heart Full of Love\\": Unfortunately, I find Ms. Seyfried's voice to be a little shrill or lacking fullness but all in all, it still worked. My favorite part is the trio in \\"A Heart Full of Love\\" involving Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks. When the three pass their voices in and out of each other and harmonize along the way, it is so lovely that I wished I could hear more.<br /><br />(4) \\"On My Own\\": I've always loved this song and I thought Samantha Barks was tremendous here. While I know she did a later London production, I wasn't sure what to expect in the movie. Not only that, I'm a big fan of Frances Ruffelle and Lea Salonga as Eponine, but Ms. Barks really showed me something here with this song. She had great power and control over her voice.  And the fact that she actually sang this song in the rain really helped me appreciate the difficulty of singing this song. One minor note: this song immediately transitions to \\"One Day More\\" so it will sound as if the song gets cuts off if you only listen \\"On My Own\\" rather than continuously to \\"One Day More\\".<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a way to re-live multiple moments in the movie, the soundtrack is a great deal at $5. If you're looking at this soundtrack as your first foray into Les Miserables, then I would suggest looking at another recording such as the London or Broadway cast recordings or the 10th anniversary one.

B009GESJH2|5.0|This was reviewed in a magazine I read lately.  It got great reviews and if you are a Kid Rock fan this is supposed to hit all different types of music.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Have you ever found a series you can't put down? One you read while brushing your teeth or cooking dinner or while curled in your favorite chair? The Beautiful Creatures series is it .<br /><br />You have to love every good character and hate the bad ones with a passion. You find yourself humming New songs in your spare time like 17 moons. And if you can totally lose yourself such as I can into an excellent book you look up at the night sky looking for that seven pointed star.<br /><br />I encourage anyone and everyone to lose yourself in the supernatural unlike all others and fall in love with Ethan and Lena!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome. That's all that needs to be said. But this review requires eight more words to be said. The end. :)
B005NPBT5M|5.0|In my opinion, The Wall is the best collaborations between Roger Waters and David Gilmore. It is a classic piece of rock music!!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Songs taken straight out of the film, no &#34;studio recordings,&#34; so what you hear in the film is what you'll hear on this CD.<br /><br />Wonderful music.  Epic story.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Watched all previous movies before and found this one to be great ... Although it had a lot more CGI the storyline was good ... And I enjoyed it
B004132HZS|5.0|Not only did they capture the essence of Sherlock Holmes, but the many nods to the original stories are awesome!
B009SQRL4U|3.0|This is a cute family movie that is full of heart and well placed humor. My 13 year old daughter and I enjoyed watching it with many LOL and Awww moments! My husband fell asleep in the first five minutes, however. There were three or four times where they actually use phrases and songs that belong to Jesus and name Santa instead. The oldest son sarcastically sings \\"Glory in the Highest\\" to his dad (who is santa) as a slap in the face in front of all the elves as he arrogantly walks out on his dad. That was done in very poor taste. Without the slams on God, I would' e rated this movie higher.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Thanks, Ellen. I laughed and my heart got happier. Mission accomplished. I will definitely be giving this to all my friends and family. My little way of making the world better.
0679809015|5.0|I bought this book for my 2  grand nieces (15 and 17 months) who both love animals. We Skype all the time and this book is a favorite. They love to imitate the sounds and are learning quickly. Their mothers and fathers MUST read this book to them. I love watching them &#34;read&#34; the book!
B00992CF6W|4.0|please fix the survival part when you click the box with dots that you don't have to get items to make items then I would rate 4 stars.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read the entire series and loved it.  Spicy :) Fun:) and would love to read another series by this author.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is a great app with so many uses, I keep finding more.  I use it everyday and the fact that I can sync it with my Kindle and my PC is the greatest. I recommend this to everyone I know.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This app is okay but like mc3 I thought the campaign was kinda short.<br />The multiplayer is good wish there were more people but I like how you can play people in the same rank so you don't get killed every 5 seconds. Gun selection is okay but could be better.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I've always enjoyed the John Corey series.  On top of suspense and mystery there's always that sarcastic humor of his; which makes the book more fun to read.  This book, like all other Nelson DeMille books are suspenseful and hard to put down because you want to see what's going to happen next; so you just keep reading and before you know it, half the night has past and it's almost time to get ready for work.  I loved this book as I have his others.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Story line starts out a little slow but before you know it you are sucked into this fantastic story. Two thirds of your way into the book, you won't be able to put it down.

B00A27NN50|5.0|Woody Allen is a genius! This movie has it all, comedy, drama, relational issues, different cultures and religions. Diane Keaton did a great acting job here also. I will watch this movie a few times a year. As good as the movie &#34;Manhattan and Interiors.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly love this game. It's like temple run but you can switch different lanes but there is no turning. I seriously think you should buy it free is too cheap for this
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|My 10 year old grandson loves nerf guns. He thought it was great that this one can hold mutiple clips for shooting lots of nerf &#34;bullets&#34;.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Although a bit short, it's a fun ride!<br />Not too difficult and not too easy. I would definitely recommend this game. Especially if you enjoy the supernatural.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I thought this movie was Good.  Not as good as some of the other PIXAR movies but still pretty good story and graphics are of course beautiful..
B0002TJGQS|5.0|they are exactly what they say they are and they are inexpensive. arrived quickly too! i would them order again.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I'm not \\"tech-y\\", so this isn't going to be a technical review.  Suffice it to say, we searched the web looking for this favorite game, and are extremely disappointed with the graphics on our new Galaxy Tab II.  We have free apps that have far superior graphics, and better load time, etc.<br />I regret having paid for this, and won't be recommending it to anyone.  Previous reviewers are right, LAZY!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story starts with the couple already married and works back a little to help explain why it happened.  There a few cute quips from each of the characters as the story progresses and the story is fairly well told.  Of course the conflict did seem contrived since first one of the main characters is battling the idea of being married to a virtual stranger and as soon as that is resolved, the other suddenly can't handle the idea of fully embracing marriage.  That part bothered me a bit, but it was still a relatively enjoyable read.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Lots of violence but good movie.  That's kind of a given, though.  Good story with good acting.  No more words.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I am held captivated by every word and paragraph on this magnificent journey.  The author has been so consistent and engaging in her storytelling.  This has been one of the best if not the best series of historic novels that I have ever read.<br /><br />I reccomend the outlander series to everyone who wants to know what I have been reading.  I am almost finished with this one and on to the next.

B003EYVXTG|3.0|This movie was OK, but I can't recommend it to anyone.  I think it was nominated, but did not receive any awards.
0345529057|5.0|My only regret is that I didn't by the series all at one time.  It would have saved me a few bucks, but I wasn't sure it would be my type of book. I haven't been able to put them down though. I bought the first one on my kindle for my son to read while he was in the hospital but he was unable to read it or stand the light.  Once he was out of danger, I started reading them and I haven't stopped yet.  I did buy the series for him in paperback for Christmas and can't wait til he reads them so we can discuss them!
1451620829|5.0|This is by far the most honest of the three memoirs written by original members of Kiss. The detail spares no one. Very enjoyable read, and an illuminating one. Highly recommended.

1402786360|4.0|I had this cookbook on the top of my wishlist for Christmas, and was super excited when my brother got it for me. I love her blog, and her recipes are over-the-top-amazing. Flipping through the book, there are a lot of great recipes, and even though there are a lot of pictures, there seems to be hardly any pictures of the finished product. This makes me a little sad, and put off from the book.<br /><br />It's a wonderfully different cookbook, though. This is the first I've seen a cookbook talk about the art of baking and it's possible for anyone to do anything in this book. It even includes templates for some of the recipes.<br /><br />There are a lot of recipes from her blog, which actually I'm happy about. Just because it's on her blog doesn't mean it shouldn't be in her book. I was very happy to see the edible spoons and Queen of Heart cookies because they are beautiful and it saves me the printer paper and ink to print out a recipe.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the blog, I say get the book! It's stunning and helpful, but I am being sour about the lack of finished product pictures for some of the recipes. I don't see myself making anything yet out of the book, but one day I'm going to buy a set of paintbrushes and get started. =o]
B007J4T2G8|5.0|By far one of the darkest and best romance novels I've ever read. I can't wait to finish the trilogy!
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|This product was out of box for a grand total of one hour before it stopped working. It was not handled rough, the design is poor. This made for an upsetting Christmas for one let-down 8 year old.
0547995660|5.0|I really liked this book, and the pacing of the book was very fascinating. The first half of the book seemed almost entirely like build up, and then the resolution came in the second half of the book.<br /><br />This book is set in a futuristic society that's a mix between [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]] and [[ASIN:B004QO50ZQ 1984]]. The society is completely controlled, but they live in self contained \\"communities\\" of about 2500 people, that are vigorously regulated. For example, only 50 babies are allowed to be born into the community at any one year. My guess is that this takes place around the year 2500 - 3000, but technology has stagnated because of these self contained communities, so technologically they're still stuck in the 1980s.<br /><br />The book is classified as science fiction, but the only science fiction element is that Jonas gets a call to be a \\"Receiver,\\" and he also ends up being a \\"Giver,\\" which means that he can receive old memories and give old memories. In this book, the whole community has rejected emotion and memories, but the problem with that is that you can't get rid of emotion and memories. They have to go somewhere. So, the community decided to make a job called Receiver, which contains all of the emotion and memories in a single person, to protect everyone else from these emotions. This makes the job of the Receiver really frustrating, because he or she can't share the emotions or memories with anybody, besides the previous Receiver who has to die after just a year of training.<br /><br />It's the first of a four-part series, but it stands alone well as a single book. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Very tight, well put together story<br />+Fascinating and thought provoking. I'm going to be thinking about this book for months to come.<br />+A very fun, quick read<br />+If you read it as a family, it gives a lot of interesting topics for discussion<br /><br />Cons:<br />-A little slow at first
B009PJXY3M|4.0|was looking bargain music... stumbled on to this one. $5.  this is pretty much like bubble gum pop.  i listened to the sample provided on amazon - seemed like tunes with a nice beat and a sultry voice for a 20 year old.  just found out she's some kind of teen disney person.  her voice doesn't match her face - her voice is nice now but she'll get even better with age.<br /><br />the songs are good -- they are fun.  i'm listening to it right now on my stereo - pretty good bit rate.<br /><br />there is a 'deluxe' version i just read... i might splurge and buy the 3 extra tracks.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|OK, so I read this comment in one of the reviews saying this was the perfect read for the ladies. Hey! Some of us guys like a nice romance once in a while. Or more than once in a while. Especially us married ones - we had to have done something right to get that ring on her finger. Of course, we'll never admit to liking this stuff in public (and never, ever to another guy - our testosterone levels would automatically drop by 50% at least). We'll put a cover on the paperback, and we'll keep the Kindle close to our chests on the commute. If our wives get too close we'll turn the light off on our reader and tell them we're actually reading about the history of football or the French and Indian Wars or something manly like that. However - given the anonymity of the internet, all bets are off (that really isn't me in my avatar; I just stole it from some romance novel cover model).<br /><br />Anyway, now that that's off my chest, on to the review:<br /><br />I wanted light and fluffy. I expected light and fluffy. And I got light and fluffy. Until the last quarter of the book. Then it got pretty serious, because these two people have some serious history that they're running from. Then it's like a train wreck. But a good train wreck. Oh just read it - you'll have fun. Look at that cover I dare - no double dare - you to tell me there won't be an HEA here. Megan and Connor are really likeable, the plot, while predictable (and sometimes predictable is exactly what you're looking for) is cute. I will say that Megan's cousin and her two \\"best friends\\" are evil, and should be locked in a room together until only one is left standing. And then that one should just be left in the room.<br /><br />Speaking of the cover: Megan looks like a younger Renee Zellweger, which is totally how I see her. However, Connor looks like Jon Krasinski (maybe that is him) from \\"The Office\\", which is not how I saw the character (I think there's some generic perfect rugged, dark haired early-to-mid thirties guy that we're supposed to picture when we read most of these books. Unless he's blond) at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book made me realize that love is stronger than anything else. No matter how hard it is, if it doesn't kill you it makes you stronger.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Arrived on time, as advertised, son  likes it, no more needed to say about it as that is reason it was purchased.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love it. Its very addicting, and a great way to pass time. And very fun, too. Just what I needed. ^.^ If you are looking for a great game, this one is it. Id recommend this game to anyone and everyone!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Review: 5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Hopeless is the first book I have read by author, Colleen Hoover although her Slammed series has been on my radar for quite some time. I have to admit I wasn't prepared at all for the emotions this book evoked, it was another extremely late night staying up to finish reading, I was truly captivated by this amazing, thought provoking story.<br /><br />Seventeen year-old Linden Sky is sarcastic, witty and strong; she lives with her mother Karen in a technology free household and after being home-schooled her whole life is about to start public school, already holding a not so stellar reputation for making out with a lot of boys who don't make her `feel' she is shocked by her reaction to Dean Holder<br /><br />Dean Holder {sigh} is a bad boy who isn't, he is caring, understanding and has experienced grief and loss; he has a temper, can be arrogant and moody but his interactions with Sky and the way he held her together despite his own inner demons made me absolutely gush.<br /><br />\\"Dean Holder? Messy brown hair? Smoldering blue eyes? A temper straight out of Fight Club?\\" Six<br /><br />The banter between Sky and Holder had me giggling, I loved the dialogue and how they each had to one up the other. The chemistry between them was scorching hot; I adored watching their relationship progress and see them come together as more than just friends - their first kiss (that wasn't) was overwhelming and wonderful.<br /><br />Despite enjoying the romantic aspect, the story is also heart breaking and filled with some gut wrenching secrets as well as a difficult subject matter, I had no idea what to expect; I had a slight inkling about what Sky had endured but how the rest of her life had panned out and the reasoning as to why I was clueless, I liked the element of surprise, especially when it came to her mother, Karen.<br /><br />Mention should also go to the wonderful side characters; best friend Six was amazing, I'd love to read a story written from her POV & Breckin was a classic.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's writing is mesmerizing, the words she has penned flow beautifully and you are captivated by the gut wrenching tale she is telling but also see the hope. Each piece of the plot came together perfectly, from the very first moment Sky and Holder meet to the very ending, it all fit together nicely to create a stunningly real, passionate and complex story.<br /><br />Hopeless is an intense, poignant, emotional roller-coaster of a read; the journey Sky and Holder had to take was traumatic and fraught with pain but they did it side-by-side, certainly not without a few misunderstandings but the way he protected her left me swooning and cheering for a HEA.<br /><br />A few of my favourite quotes:<br /><br />\\"The first time you kissed me?\\" I say. \\"That moment when your lips touched mine? You stole a piece of my heart that night\\"<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend Hopeless, a story about, love, loss, life and hope.ten from her POV & Breckin was a classic.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's writing is mesmerizing, the words she has penned flow beautifully and you are captivated by the gut wrenching tale she is telling but also see the hope.

1878424319|5.0|I found this book to be simply a positive yet short and to the point book. It has no fluff. Just direct wisdom of how one should approach life to simplify it, engage it and enjoy it. Cheers!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I think it works great for the home so you can plain your day. Well it wants me to say some more about this App. So I did
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story was interesting, but the sex scenes got old after awhile1  By the second book, I just skipped the sex & read the story.  I'm not going too read the third book!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun game.  no problems. great entertainment for a no cost game.  just like the old Atari game from years ago.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I have used avast for windows on several computers and the product has always provided satifactory services.  No more words.
0060723513|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  This is the first book I am reading to my newborn son.  Perfect brilliance!  Marlo is spreading the truth!!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was interesting to pick out the pieces of the movie and to fill in gaps.  A must read indeed.
1603427244|5.0|This is a great reference to have in your knitting library.  The illustrations are very understandable.  There is a wide variety of techniques shown.  I especially was interested in casting on for making socks.
B005LAII6C|5.0|This movie had great characters, solid plot line, enjoyable and morable scenes. I would recommend for anyone who likes awesome CGI, groovy special effects and has a Halloween spirit!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Muy comoda configuracion del control, la mejor, super ergonomico, adaptable a toda posicion, ! ! ! ! esteticamente muy bonito
B004F1F32A|3.0|For anyone that likes action movies and can forget about reality, it's probably a darn good movie, but for me it was a little over the top.  The buffering issues only made that worse though.  I wouldn't expect that type a problem with my 75Mb FiOS internet.  How well could it work for someone with <5Mb?
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Loved the story between father and daughter and the misunderstandings and hard feelings that can develop. atching this.Would highly recommend!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I haven't played myself but my kids like to play this alot. Seems like a fun and somewhat educational game.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this CD for my Grandaughter for Christmas.One Direction is her favorite group.She was so thriled when she opened her gift.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Our preschool kids love this movie and it's one we like to watch with them. So glad this came out on blu-ray!
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I enjoy this port of a classic dreamcast game. it has been done well and works great on a touch screen android phone.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this for my nephew as a Christmas gift because he recently started playing the violin. He loved the music and Lindsey is really original adding new wave beats to a classical instrument. It is great to just let your imagination run away with you listining to Lindsey's music.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child did it again!  Great read!  Pendergast at his finest again... lots of twists and turns.  Wonderful book!
B008FOB124|5.0|Has to be my favorite CD. It has inspired me to become a musician myself and create something with similar sounds.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|This album captures and is appropriate for the entire winter months and holidays. Taylor's voice and the different style he plays for several songs make this one unique. \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is like an \\"Easter egg\\" in the album to me as I'm not quite sure why it's there or how it fits in but it makes for a wonderful change of pace.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game is a lot of fun... spent all day playing :)  However,  it's not one you'll go back to over and over. Once you solve it, it feels done.
B007EDYN36|4.0|As a KISS Fan since the early 70's I grew up worshiping these guys, it was interesting to learn of the shananigans that went on back then. I found that peter was opening up his life in this book, I see that he still struggles with the way he was treated by his bandmates, I hope he does find forgiveness for them eventually, same for all of them. Overall I ebjoyed the book, if you were ever a KISS fan in the 70's its a decent read.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really enjoy this game! I have at least 6 games going with friends constantly. The comments feature is particularly fun when interesting drawings warrant them. The ability to \\"save\\" drawings is pretty useless because you can't pull them up and insert them when you need them while playing. But that hasn't stopped me from enjoying this clever game.
1400032717|1.0|They are all great
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|Really dissappointed - waste of money - story line is weak and photography is poor.  I'd pass if I were you.

B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I think Big Bang is a great show so I was excited to see a deal on season 5 which I hadn't seen at all yet.  In my haste of ordering I made a format mistake and ordered a couple seasons on DVD and a couple on Blu-ray.  After using both I am just waiting for another deal to order Blu-Ray to replace the DVD.  The picture quality was find with the DVD, it's the overall viewing experience offered on the Blu-ray I missed such as useful pop-up menus for looking at upcoming episodes and the special features without leaving the show.  I only have one other TV show on Blu-ray so maybe it is common place but what I thought was cool was that when the end of the disc came along it would prompt me to put the next disc in without ever leaving the Blu-ray main menu which made for a smooth transition between discs and saved me a couple minutes of waiting for it to reload but was just cool to see the capabilities of Blu-ray and the players being used.  I assume it behaves this way on all players but I was using a PS3.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo is good. I am satisfied w/yahoo .....have not had too many problems with them over the years that I've had them..thanks

B000001E3L|5.0|My husband is a Van Morrison groupy.  He has all his CD's.  This particular one is his favorite and he just had to have another one, in case the first one got lost or scratched.  I got it for him as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  It came quickly and in perfect condition.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I loved the large numbers. It has additional buttons to add more sophisticated mathematical functions. Highly recommend this free app.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Excellent ending to a great series. I highly recommend this read if you are a fan of the Hunger Games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down. Can not wait to read the other two books in the series. I recommend it for everyone to read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly has delivered another great book.<br />Once I started readng I couldnt put it down.<br />Would recommend to any Bosch Fan.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|This was a desire to have for holidays and glad to have gotten it for a bargain. Plan to enjoy it for years to come.
B005PMNBNG|2.0|Honestly, only buy the first three songs. The entire album is not worth buying, in my humble opinion. All instrumental and soft and not in a good Sigur Ros sort of way. The rest of the album sounds nothing like Midnight City, which is what most people would expect.
B004FWPK8G|5.0|One of Goldie Hawn's great movie...<br />What happens to this &#34;Prima Donna is a bellyful of laughs.<br />This is how you can change for the better...
B008FPOIT6|4.0|The story contains a blend of \\"old\\" technology and new technology in a fascinating mystery. A fascinating story idea and well written.

B001P9EQH8|3.0|I purchased this with a pair of Shure SRH440s and hooked it up to my computer. I always had it plugged in through USB throughout use.<br /><br />It drove my headphones just fine, and the sound quality was alright.<br /><br />Unfortunately you can only do so much with the audio coming out of a integrated sound card in a Dell computer. I was not impressed with the quality of the sound the E5 produced. There was a constant high-pitched sound when the USB cable was connected, and the amp amplified a low hiss.<br /><br />All-in-all this performs fairly well, but don't expect a miracle out of it.
B009LRE040|5.0|What else can I say...I love Batman ..It is very candid In a sort of dark, yet innocent way....This is truly what I love about Batman......I must confess I am more of a Batman guy than the other guy from where is it again? Krypton?
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I purchased this as an upgrade to the FiiO E5. Although I didn't need more power, I wanted a discrete DAC. Originally I was using this with a pair of Shure SRH440s, and the sound was great. It did a fantastic job driving those cans.<br /><br />I am currently using this in conjunction with a FiiO E9 and a pair of Grado SR325is. The two devices work very well together, and they look really cool while doing it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the fact it's touch n go,the only downfall is my four year old who loves my little ponies, loses patience easily.
B004TI5N38|4.0|If you like jack reacher you will like John puller. Very similar characters. Military trained, loners, imposing physiques (not like Tom Cruise).
B00597A6NU|5.0|the movie was great as i watched it many times,too see real b-17's still flying in almost their original condition,the movie was accurate as ship and crew bonding together as family..but leaving out the gruesome facts,the bombers fell from the sky in flames,one every 15 minutes,the 109 ammo was a 20mm shell which was capable of cutting the aircraft in half,the 109's matched the b-17's speed and flew within 50 feet of them shooting from behind untill the b-17 burst into flames,and if that wasnt bad enough some of the fighters followed the b-17 down to shoot the crew parachuting from the doomed aircraft,the germans were ruthless and merciless..and the b-17's were not attacked by half a dozen 109's as depicted in this movie but 40 fighters was the german standerd attacking over 300 b-17's in pairs of 2..the germans skilled in the knowledge of the\\"fat bus\\" aimed for the bomb payload to ignite and explode 2500 lbs of explosives destroying the b-17 and her crew,there were missions where 100 or more b-17's perished in a single mission also they attacked in waves,up to 3 waves which each wave lasted 1 hour 50 minutes..so the b-17's had fought long and hard to get home.up to 25% of each squadron perished in the worst and toughest missions,which was up to 6 or 7 b-17's per squadron..these were the bravest of men...
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I'm still in the process of reading this book.  It has great advice for artists and writers.  It's inspiring and fun.  I'm glad I ordered it and look forward to reading the entire book!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book, I loved the way it was presented to the reader. Can't wait to read it again! And to watch the movie
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an interesting read! I loved this book!  It was a fast and easy read.  This book has some strange concepts, but it's great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I rated this five stars it is aaaaawwwwwwssssooommme<br />It is a great I cannot believe how great this app is its amazing
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I like how the main character fully owns up to his mistakes with humor and forgiveness and moves on. The second in the series maintains the high quality of suspense and character development. I can't wait for the third.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Read the book first. The movie is weak. The alternate story told to the Japanese gentlemen leaves you pondering.<br />A+
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by my response to this book. I had recently read (correction 're-read) \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" which undoubtedly rated Jane Austen's finest and has been a favorite of mine for years! It was actually one of the reasons I had delayed so long to start another by Austen for though I had heard great things about \\"Emma\\" (as well as others) I found myself very reluctant to start for fear of being disappointed. I was very bull headed in believing I would not like Emma the main character going into the story because I hate when female characters for lack of a better word \\"meddle\\" in other characters business. Boy was I wrong.I came to adore Emma and only wish I had not gone into the book so stubborn to dislike her! For this reason I am tempted to start reading it again without the previous false pretenses. So to those who were like me and are nervous due to what they have heard, please don't be! Nothing can compare to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but do not fear \\"Emma\\" because of it!
B006RXPUR2|5.0|This is a movie that keeps your interest, keeps you guessing. Good acting, great scenery (I love Boston).<br />I like this movie better than The Town, also a Ben Affleck directed movie.
B0095T3ES2|5.0|This was a surprisingly realistic story of love found, lost and re-found. But it doesn't follow the typical Hollywood formula at all. It goes to places I couldn't predict which was crazy and hilarious. Great characters. Really, really good. The thing is, it's not likely for everyone. Married people will like it a lot, but it may be over the heads of a younger audience.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I sure hope there will be mqny sequels to this newest book.  I cannot bare the wait!  Thank you Preston and Child.
B002JIEYKS|4.0|this one feels like the zombies odessey and oracle (had to check the spelling)<br />a group knowing theyre on the way out and giving it a last hurrah.<br /><br />in both cases very artful and entertaining albums<br />were produced.<br /><br />of course soon after this they ran with the dio lineup<br />then later the martin era..<br /><br />n.s.d. is proggy, a product of its time,<br />heavy in some areas and psyche-ey in others.<br /><br />recommended if you are open-minded and into heavy music.
B001706I5I|4.0|This is a great mix of CGI and traditional movie artistry.  While the original animated version is my favorite because that's what I grew up watching, this version is wonderful as well.  Anthony Hopkins was the perfect voice for the narrative and I can think of no other actor that could have pulled off the Grinch character as well as Jim Carrey has.  This one is a must-see.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This really is a 5 star book.  I'm giving it a 4.5 because of the sad part that I wish could have been omitted.  Other than that, the book is heart stopping, warm, loving, sweet, well written, and all the goodness wrapped up.  I love (so-called) bad boys that end up with good girls.  I enjoy love that takes my breath away when I encounter it or think about it.  I want more Sky and Holder.  It would be so magical if Ms. Colleen Hoover would continue their story.  Thanks for a delightful read.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|The graphics haven't aged particularly well, but the puzzles are as interesting as they were back when this game was first released.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I just LOVE Seth McFarlane. I love almost everything he does. I really enjoyed Ted, but I don't think it lived up to the hype. While it was good, I have seen &#34;Family Guy&#34; episodes that were better. So go ahead and get this film if you like Seth's work, you wont want either your money or your 2 hours back, but it is not his best work.
074356619X|5.0|It is very informative. I helps you understand and believe. it's basically God promises and principles in a cd that calls it the law of attraction.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing Solitaire. Great little game for those few extra moments when you are sitting and waiting and you sure can't beat the price.
B001XULSG6|5.0|Star Trek Next Generation was and remains a worthy successor to the original Star Trek series.  This movie ties a lot of elements of the NG series together and delivers a great story and excellent production to boot.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Another great film by Miyazaki..lots of attention to detail and great voice actors too! Be sure you're getting the Disney version though, otherwise it will have spanish subtitles (if not spoken spanish.)
B001N1DPDE|5.0|THIS IS A KNIFE!!!! VERY WELL MADE BLADE TAKES A GREAT EDGE AND EXTREMELY THICK BLADE. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT WORKINGMANS KNIFE!!!!! THE SHEATH IS ALSO VERY WELL MADE  I ALSO PURCASED THE MICARTA GRIPS TO GO WITH THE KNIFE BUT FOUND THAT THE GRIPS THAT CAME ON THE KNIFE WERE ALREADY FINE .I OWN ALOT OF KNIVES.... MORE THAN 50 AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE!!!! SO MUCH SO I ALREADY BOUGHT ANOTHER!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I'm having fun! Great way to kill time. this was always one of my favorite games at local fairs. Wish the coins could regenerate faster.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is great but when you go to the boosts button it has mystery box and it costs 500 coins and that's a lot of coins to use on just one thing
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Interesting take on the lives of Emma, Jane, and Frank.  Excellent acting, especially by Jonny Lee Miller and Romola Garai.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. It's a twisting thrilling love story that has so many twists you just want to keep reading and reading.
B008VBYN80|2.0|Unfortunately, you don't do much but click on buildings.  Hard at times if you want to not spend money.  My search continues for a game that is fun to play and doesn't keep trying to drag money out of you or add friends.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I pre-ordered this video for myself and one for my sister for Christmas. I already had the first two seasons. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to pre-order. I love the storyline in this series.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|Bought this as I got my Kindle Fire during cyber week for cheap.  You get what you pay for when you buy a cheaper case.  Its solid and light weight but the stand/cover itself is overly simple and not very sturdy.  Again cheap and you get waht you pay for but works decent enough.
0205313426|5.0|This is a small book with very important tips and tricks for any writer, school projects or novels.  This was a recommended buy from a professor in college and I'm glad I have it in my library for future reference.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Could get the 3rd movie on Blu Ray for $22 at Walmart, or pre-order the set for $27.00 or whatever I payed for at the time.  Was a no brainer.  Plus it is Batman and all three of these movies are a must have.  Picture book that comes along with it is an extra bonus worth having!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was, by far the best I ever read! I will definitely definitely reading the next books. Hunger games rocks!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! Wish it was a little easier to earn points to unlock games, but no complaints!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Found this book while perusing books to down load on my kindle.  What an excellent read!  Interesting, educational, funny, and way better than I thought it would be about becoming a Chef!  Now I will have to read all the rest of books he has written! Talented, smart guy; who would have known!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soooo great and massively entertaining. its far better than temple run and I'm now hooked. In all the time I have spent playing this game I have not once expirienced a glitch of any sort. Its a must have. I am in love with this game. Go subway surfers!!
B0084IG7KC|3.0|The main character did an amazing job portraying katniss. Actually all of the characters were very very good. I just feel like if you just watch the movie without reading the book first you miss out on a lot of meaning and thoughts, things that I thought were important in the story. The movie was good visually but personally I think that the movie should've been in first person like the book, with a VoiceOver so we could hear katniss's thoughts.
007174889X|5.0|I bought from this seller and its cheap compared to others. The 2 volume bundle was in very good condition upon arrival. I got this product before the date they mentioned. And I do not need to emphasize the worthiness of this book. It's a must book for every Physician.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Nanny McPhee Returns gets 5 stars for fun and fantasy. It is as good as the 1st Nanny McPhee, but with a new story. Emma Thompson is as brilliant as she is in most characters she plays. How can you go wrong with fun and fantasy? What you get is a lot of laughter and magic.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I have some tolerance for dumb comedies if they are at least entertaining along the way.  This one was not only inane, insipid and stupid, it also wasn't even funny. After 20 minutes, I turned it off and contacted Amazon to arrance a refund, which is something I rarely do.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love Fishdom or the PC, so when I saw they had it for kindle..It made my day. It is a match 3 game, but you decorate your aquarium as you go.. you can by new aquariums etc. Wonderful game for anyone.
B00519YRH2|5.0|Anyone 7 years and older cannot help but love this movie.  I've tried showing it to kids under 7 years-old and they just don't get it but everyone older than that absolutely loves the movie.  It is a true &#34;feel good&#34; movie and it is also a legendary film because it rightfully launched Tom Hanks' career.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|When I got this one, I thought it was just for kids. One day my daughter had to go to the dr and I was going to play this with her..it is actually wonderful. It is a cooking time managment game and it is great for all ages. You can set the difficulty of this one for younger kids to adults. Very fun.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this game.  The pace was just right and the level of difficulty was just right.  Cannot wait for the Sequel.
B00000IQW5|5.0|My congratulations to the one responsible for casting these actors and actresses -- Dreyfuss, Goodman, and Hunter are perfect -- this movie just simply wouldn't fly with others in their roles..... And, as with so many of his other films, Spielberg has given it his golden touch.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This item was a Christmas present.  I'm sorry, but this is not my type of music.  Sorry I couldn't provide a true rating.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|I was mildly disappointed in LOST's final season. I had hoped for more answers to unanswered questions. Well done visually and the acting was, as before, consistent in terms of character development... however, a bit of an anti-climax after five prior seasons of what-the-heck-is-going-on-here plot twists, time shifts, and magnetic field fluxes.  Still, I'm looking forward to watching the entire series from the beginning sometime just to pick up on things that I surely must have missed in the first viewing.
B005IS565S|5.0|This item was a Christmas present.  I'm sorry, but this is not my type of music.  Sorry I couldn't provide a true rating.
6304712944|5.0|I've always enjoyed this movie-musical interpretation of the legend of King Arthur. It brings forth the emotional tangle that connected Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot in a way that other forms of presentation simply cannot.  It is a mostly light-hearted treatment of the legend that is suitable for most audiences, somewhat long as movies go, but well worth watching more than once.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This item was a Christmas present.  I'm sorry, but this is not my type of music.  Sorry I couldn't provide a true rating.
B0053O8ARI|5.0|Purchased for a friend.We love this show and email about it Can't wait for second season to come out on DVD.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|This item was a Christmas present.  I'm sorry, but this is not my type of music.  Sorry I couldn't provide a true rating.
0307454568|5.0|I purchased this 3rd in the series book for myself and have not yet finished it.Really good, hard to put down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had seen the first movie, and really just decided to read the book on a whim, and it grabbed me as soon as I started.  It only took three days to finish and I loved it.  Five stars!
B0009XRZ9M|1.0|Purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my six year old Grandson.  Movie disk would not play when opened on Christmas day.  Features disk worked OK.  One star is not for product but for dealer.  Movie when it works gets five stars.  Understanding that this can happen any time with a DVD I requested the dealer to provide a replacement but he indicated that it was out of stock and provided a refund instead.  However a check of that dealers site that day showed that he had 16 copies of the exact product that I ordered in stock and available for sale.  It was apparently easier for him to provide a refund than to fix the problem.  Some customer service, I will never make another purchase from this dealer again.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This book was so awesome and suspenseful and exciting and I was clinging on to every word I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys horror or action
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book is very inteeresting reading even though there are some parts that are a bit &#34;slow&#34; and hard to understand exactly what the author is trying to tell you.  The conclusion also allows one to make up ones own mind about the story told which I really do not like to have to do!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Well it does get complex as u go a long but lill ones can stay on the first stage to play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game,very kid friendly,and the colors on this game are very vibrant my kids and husband love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but my girlfriend recommended this book so I figured I'd give it a shot. Read the whole thing cover to cover in three days, and loved every minute of it.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I received this CD quickly.  It has some Christmas as well as other songs mixed in.  Typical James Taylor music.  My second graders enjoy listening to it during writing.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Excellent app. Lots of control. I used to have trouble getting up in the morning but this app really does the job especially with the math problems!
0385535147|5.0|Have not had a chance to read yet BUT if it's anything like any of his other books this is sure to be as thrilling as all the other Grisham books I've collected.  Received very quickly!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is the full Game on APP (on a NEXUS 7) Its Fun Challenging, great graphics and a Hit.  Very well made game that will have repeat play value as well.  Worth it!!!
B003I55BIA|5.0|Fast read, couldn't put it down! So real :) Author did a fantastic job keeping my attention and I truly did enjoy this wonderful book.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|It came fast and is nice color and appears good for minor protection of the Kindle..we shall see over time..my daughter liked it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The ending kind of let me down but the book was good.<br />Definitely worth reading to finish up the series.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|One of the most excellent sequels ever made.  It has all of the elements of any good action flick, with a little tongue-in-cheek humor thrown in for good measure; not to mention an all-star cast of the best action heroes of all time.  A terrific followup to the original and they both make a good movie night.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas Present for my adult daughter, she loves Dr. Quinn and had said she would love the complete series if anyone could find it. Her reaction to the gift was sheer happiness, it was the best gift I've given her in years. Thanks for having it for me to buy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just started to play this game. All in all I'd have to say that this game is not so bad so far. Not bad so far
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was very happy to read this book, the main character is an intelligent and sensitive young man and I love that he is brutally honest in his letters to his anonymous someone. Anyways it was a great book.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have followed her career from it's start by winning the contest years back-when sh shoched the judges and the audiance.<br /> She has gone on to do many pleasant albums with her fine voice.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Pretty good ;)  the ending leaves you hanging and some things are repetitive but you defiantly can't put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|Me and my sister LOVE this app I was glad it was free.I was looking at subway surfers and one of the comments said it said that if you like temple run you will like this game so I looked it up and I fell in love with the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating for the right reason,  the book deserves it. The Hunger Games is a great book that I would recommend to anyone from 10 to 99 because everyone can read this book in their own way, it is not as much fighting and bloody as some people think, and this book is an introduction to government for young readers. Instead of sitting through boring  lectures about this type of government does this and this type does that it shows young readers a government were they can say how wrong or right they think it is. then you compare it to our government and you get sensation of wow that if we let the government stay like this we could turn into the Hunger Games and that would not be good. I can't really compare this book to any other I have read except one that is titled Anthem and has that same futuristic type of feel and also talks about government. I Love The Hunger Games SO MUCH and would thrilled if someone read my review and then decided to read the wonderful love story futuristic action packed intense government introduction and fun amazing book that everybody wants to read...... and that means you too.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Hard to put down...1:45am. Very graphic; Not for the faint of heart. Can't wait to read the next book !
B008S4YZCO|3.0|The game is pretty cool I play it almost every day but. I wish they had it for kindle because my phone and I have to buy another but I can't until the 4th sometimes I think if I forget about it games would be cheaper and better further in life
B009FREK3W|3.0|This album sounds great.  Almost as great as the originals.  I would have given the album 5 stars for performance but have to go with three because I don't see the need to remake these classics.  The album is ok but not necessary.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved it. A must read.  I personally think that teenagers or young adults would enjoy this story the most but anyone should try it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book is a little hard to get into because of how it is written. But once you get into it you really feel what Charlie feels. You laugh, you cry, you'll feel sad and happy.<br />It is a great book especially for young adults who aren't sure where they fit in yet. Gives the sense of hope.<br />This book is the type of book that will make you cry because of the sad lonely parts but also cry because you are so happy for the character in the book.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I may not be the best writer, thinker nor analyst, but it appears to me that of all the possible ways to interpret each stimuli, it should be said that beauty can only be comprehended by sharing something 'true' in common with each object, whether they be animate or not, because what is reality but a bunch of guesses and a bit of faith? John Green, who ever you may be, thanks for adding a glimmer of hope and a simultaneous glimpse at both reality and fantasy in your wonderful tale.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Not for me.  Probably more for little kids.  I wouldn't bother.  I didn't see any real skill involved at all.
6305128952|5.0|This story is sad and awesome all at the same time. It is an excellent family movie to watch.  Need more videos like this.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Haven't had a chance to listen to all of it, but the quality of the recording is good.  Lots of good music in the James Bond movies.
B00000IQW5|5.0|My all time favorite movie. I have watched this video several times throughout a day. It is awesome. A must see.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you love the big bang theory, they are back at it again with another season of scientific humor. It's a purchase you can enjoy again and again.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Quite a few cases to choose from so I wasn't sure . . . The different angles and portrait or landscape is very nice.  I bought the purple one.  Fortunately, it's more of a dark grape color than the screaming purple shown in the product ad.  Nice leather with a felt interior and built in hand grip (like a handle) within.  Don't hesitate to purchase this for your Kindle 8.9!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing read. Was kind of thinking it was going to be a girl book but it turned out to be awesome and I can't wait to read the next book
B003O86FMW|5.0|I simply can't stop reading this series!<br />This was a great book and an easy read. I can't wait to read the third book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|As a parent, I'm amazed at the endless possibilities and complexity of this deceivingly simple platform. It has high entertainment and educational value. It encourages creativity, planning, and organization. The following review was written by my son who has been playing Minecraft since back when it was still in the early stages of Beta.<br /><br />There is no other game like this. Minecraft is a one-of-a-kind game, and I recommend it for all ages and people. I like the way the game lets you build nearly anything you want wherever you want. The action/adventure parts are really fun -- like fighting zombies, skeletons, and spiders. But you can also play Peaceful mode where you can build and explore as much as you want and and nothing will bother you. I really enjoy the look of Minecraft with its 16-bit texture and I enjoy combining things to make new objects and materials. You can be super creative with this game! Minecraft is the absolute best game in all of time, space, and matter. Good day, I'm gonna play Minecraft!
B0029QRA1U|1.0|This is a nice looking unit that didn't function. Set up went okay but after recording the first track the sound started to drag as if the turntable was slowing down. Took several attempts to get through to support on phone and also tried emailing. Ended up calling them back three times and got three different answers, none of which worked. I told them it sounded like a turntable or belt problem but they insisted it was something other than the turntable (software, speakers, etc.). Finally returened it to Amazon which refunded my purchase price in less than 24 hours (Amazon ALWAYS comes through!). I don't know if you would also have problems as there seems to be many things which must &#34;come together&#34; in order for it to work. Buyer beware.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love how to find the ways for the paths to go and all of my friends love it too
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|After seeing the movie, I can just sit back and listen with my eyes closed I can see the scenes from the movie. Powerful movie and powerful soundtrack.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|I truly enjoyed listening to this album more than i did bionic. She has a lot of uptempo and slow tempo songs. My favorites are Love Your Body, Let there be Love, Sing For Me, Blank Page, and Cease Fire. She has a good album all around and i wasn't dissappointed.
B0067LXQAW|4.0|But sooooo glad to see them recording again.  I have always liked The Cranberries and felt kind of bad when they broke up.  But now?  They are together again.  Hopefully they will put out more music.  The lyrics and vocals here are almost as good as their earlier works.  Not quite there yet.  But that is no reason not to have this in your collection.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|It's great!  I love it!  I've always loved this game.  It's  very addictive.  I like being able to compete against others for the high score.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I have always liked Ms. O'Connor.  Many people never got over her tearing the popes picture up. Get over it.  You are missing one of the best voices in a long, long time.<br /><br />If you are new to her music, this may not be the first one you should get (get one of her earlier ones for an introduction).  If you are a long-time fan, then you need this.  Ms. O'Connor evolves from CD to CD, and this is no exception.  The constant is her voice.  By all means, grab this.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I just wanted to say first -  I really don't understand why people feel it necessary to write an in depth summary of the whole book in their reviews.  This isn't book report corner, people!<br /><br />Onto my review..<br />Ernest Cline's book, Ready Player One, starts off chronicling the life of a young and destitute teen set in our future.  The future here is obsessed....  Just kidding!<br /><br />I really did love this book.  Although it seems like a completely fictional sci-fi fantasy, I could actually see how our future could end up similar to Cline's world.  Apocalypse by resource shortage, money hungry corporations, technology crazed population.. It's all there, except for maybe the zombies.<br /><br />I also love anti-heroes... The unlikely kid who made it big.  It keeps making you wonder if he has some big hidden secret, like being the long lost son of the game creator or the product of some genetic enhancements.  No, this is just some nerdy kid who got lucky.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Yes, a little play on the name of the group - but if you are a fan of Rush, then this will be a welcome addition to your collection (as it is to mine).  Even after all this time, these guys still rock.  They have proven themselves to be world class musicians - tight music, tight lyrics - a tight band.<br /><br />People may think that they have outlived their usefulness - and if you think that, you could not be more wrong.  If it has been awhile since you have listened to Rush - by all means get this CD.  If you never heard of Rush (and you may not have) - again, get this CD.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|It's more of a teen syfy IMHO but I liked it. I will add this movie to my library. A little cheesy in parts but hey who cares, isn't most syfy. For more \\"realistic\\" syfy I watch/read Phillip K Dick.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Anyone expecting another &#34;Desire,&#34; &#34;Nashville Skyline,&#34; &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34; or &#34;Highway 60 Revisited&#34; be aware - this isn't them.  But Bob Dylan has always marched to his own drummer.  I have found that his albums/cd's cannot be compared to his previous works as he changes things up.  He is an American icon who deserves that title.<br /><br />So, while this may not be his best work - it is uniquely Dylan.  So go ahead and get it.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Good great but amazing<br />The first book was amazing I was amazed with the book funny had great humor it was great
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I really wasn't expecting much when I read the reviews of this movie.  I took the chance and purchased it.  What a good choice it was.  yea, it got a little blah at the end - they could have cut down on the kid's speech, but overall a really good movie.  The special affects were done well, the acting was really good considering the main characters are kids.  I recommend this movie.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it downloaded on my kindlefire and was great....now it wont stay on.....comes up with error saying the app had to close ......anyone having this issue!?  I used to love it
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I heard a couple of their songs on the alternative station I listen to.  Based on that, I bought this CD.  That is one decision I do not regret.  This is a tight group with good vocals.  If you have not heard any of their music or maybe just a song from them, take the plunge and get this.  You will not regret it either.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Crazy twist ending. Also more characters. It has improved from the first book in this series. This one has plenty of monsters.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|The voice.  The production.  The musicians.  The songs.  What isn't there to like about this group?  There are very few CDs that I can listen too all the way through and think &#34;no weak cuts&#34;.  This is one of those.  No filler - at least as far as I am concerned.  If you want some great songs that you can sing along to - get this CD now.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|There are few things in life that can take you back in time but this DVD does just that with the music and the cultural relevance of the time.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|He isn't real happy here - and it shows.  Bruce Springsteen has been the voice of the &#34;common man&#34; for a long time - and there is a reason for that.  He writes and puts into music what people want to say.  He delivers a message.  Yea, he is rich - so what?  He still has the heart of the kid from Jersey.<br /><br />I am a long-time fan, and this is in my collection.  It gets played - a lot.  When you get this you will be playing it a lot too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its great having this on my Kindle, I Was able to play it while waiting for a train delayed by floods this morning and the time just flew by. Very enjoyable game.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|But a new CD from Sir Paul is like a visit from an old friend.  He is a world class artist, and even though I don't think this is his best, it is still a great CD worth purchasing and listening to.  If you want to relax - just slip this in the player and sit back.  Feel your hear rate go down, feel your blood pressure go down.  Nice, isn't it?
B000YHG72E|5.0|I still adore this movie and always will! This is my \\"A Christmas Story\\". This year I was able to share it with my 5 year old nephew, who also immediately fell in love with it!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|At the box office?  Yes, yes - many fans of the original series (which I am one of) - have heaped some scorn upon this movie.  What a bunch of prigs!  This is an awesome movie.  It is not a continuation of the story - it is a retelling.  And from where I sat in the theatre (and I do not go to the movies very often - I even saw this at the midnight show on opening day- that's how much I wanted to see it), it was a movie that made me go &#34;oh wow.&#34;  The actors  - first rate.  The story - first rate.  The visuals - first rate.  The music - first rate.<br /><br />I, for one, hope they do another and make this a series - much akin to the Pirates series (but not getting as weak as that series did at the end).<br /><br />The only regret that I have about it is I was hoping the actors from the original series (who made a brief appearance at the party) would have been given a larger role - especially Jonathan Frid.<br /><br />But go ahead - get this and while you are at it purchase House of Dark Shadows and do a double feature.  Heck, get Night of Dark Shadows and make it a triple feature.
B005HSL626|4.0|More addicting by playing it on my Kindle Fire. Can't complain about the ads because I ignore them. (I'm obviously preoccupied by playing the game) I really don't understand why people have so much to say about the ads. It's a FREE app....what do you expect?
B006R1T40I|5.0|If you like Bonnie Raitt, of course this will be in your collection.  If you don't know who she is - try this CD - you will not be disappointed. Why she is not played on the radio more I have NO idea.  Ms. Raitt is an American treasure.  She writes, sings, and plays - her voice is great and her interpretations of songs is 1st class.  I put her up there with Van Morrison, John Hiatt and The Chieftains when it comes to my favorite artists.
B008VBYN80|2.0|I love the game and would give it 5 stars except u have to energy for everything u do. So5 minutes us the most u can Olay it
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Ok, a lot of people have really cut this cd down.  While it is not Lou's best, it certainly isn't Metal Music.  This is not something that you will be singing along to or listening to every day - but Lou Reed has made a career of doing things differently.  This is no exception.<br /><br />I can recommend this to Lou Reed fans.  If you want an introduction to Lou Reed - this isn't the cd you want as your first.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter loves the books Dairy of a Wimpy Kid and this one is very funny and a good story i like the hard cover and the good price!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I bought this based on one song (you know which one).  Beyond that, I had no idea what to expect.  What a nice surprise - a good group, good lyrics and vocals.  Certainly any person who likes music will want this in their collection.<br /><br />If you have been holding out on purchasing this CD - don't delay any further - get it.  And don't just get the one song for pity sake, get the whole CD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love how my daughter is doing a game that takes some thought! It is also a very fun game that my daughter loves!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|of the trio they put out.  The others are good - but this is the best of the 3.  There is just something  about Green Day that keeps me coming back and listening to them.  Even though they may not be the best musicians or singers - they have &#34;it&#34; that you want to hear over and over again.<br /><br />Look at their back catalog and compare it to Uno!  I did, just to make sure I wasn't being too hard on them.  They have been consistent through the years (dare I say decades) - 3 chord power songs.  So, when I go on a road trip, this is one of the groups that I take a bunch of their music with me.<br /><br />Get this CD (along with the others of the trio).
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Me and my family love the Kindle Fire it has great games and books with fun apps and wi-fi but if there was one thing i could change it would be accounts, since me and my family share the kindle fire I think we should each have our own accounts with our own passwords, other than that we found the product very nice and handy!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|The Killers is one of my favorite groups.  When I hit the road, I grab their CDs first.  Just some first rate lyrics, great musicians and awesome vocals.  What more could one ask for in a group?  If you are on the fence about purchasing this CD - just do it.  You will be happy you did.  If you are a fan of The Killers and haven't gotten this one yet - what are you waiting for?
B0086700CM|5.0|MY KIDS LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY OTHER GAME! They can't stop playing it especially my daughter Nina! Temple Run is so fun for her every free second she gets she plays it and im not lying my daughter really really loves this game it is a five star no matter what!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Just wow.  These guys are awesome.  To be honest, I thought they were done after Sigh No More.  I really didn't think they could top that CD.  Thankfully,  I was wrong.  After listening to Babel - I think this may be a better album than Sigh No More.  I don't think I am too far off base when I say this CD has what is referred to as &#34;foot stomping music.&#34;  And that is a good thing.  But they lyrics are done well too.  So, yes, by all means - get this CD.
B005HSL626|3.0|The game Fruit Ninja is fun but after a while it gets kind of boaring my kids love the chopping and everything though.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I really like this movie.  Just check your brain at the door, sit back, relax, and enjoy.  Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford?  What could go wrong?  Yes, it is a bit schlocky, but so what?  I think that was the intent.  I recommend this to friends.  And the ones that have seen it - very few have not liked it.  So go ahead and get it - you won't be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is okay to play i wish they gave more of a veriaty of birds at a time! My son thinks the game is great but the rest of my family is kind of so, so.
0756990696|5.0|This is not only a good primer on philosophy, but a fascinating detective tale that breaks the fourth wall, recursively, no less. It makes you think and think, then at one point you fall down the rabbit hole, getting dizzier and dizzier. Are you writing the book? Is the book writing you? And what about that four billion year old rabbit being pulled out of a hat as big as the universe?
0399534601|5.0|My daughter absolutely LOVES to write. I was desperate to help her expand her horizons beyond beautiful princesses and fairies. This book, only 4 days old has already started her imagination juices flowing. We recently brought it on a car trip, and she was occupied the entire time with this wonderful book!

B0049EN064|1.0|I purchased seasons 1 through 5....there was only one vendor at the time with season 4.  It just so happened that vendor was from the UK.  The postage was only a few dollars, so I purchased it.  A few weeks after delivery, I was ready for season 4.  Upon trying to view it, I discovered that it was not compatible with our DVD player.  I will be trying to get a refund.

B009O07NDY|5.0|I love film scores and I collect the ones that I feel are wonderfully composed, even if I did not enjoy the film itself. I have all three \\"Lord of the Rings\\" scores and I thought the music was original, beautiful (haunting when it needed to be) and fit the films perfectly. Howard Shore is a fantastic composer, and that is clearly seen in \\"The Hobbit.\\" I admit, I was nervous at first. I was worried the score would contain a rehash of the music from the first trilogy, and how wrong I was. In hindsight, I shouldn't have had any such worries when it comes to such a talented composer.<br /><br />The music of \\"The Hobbit\\" is majestic, adventurous, ominous, and once again, a perfect fit for the film. I first listened to the score before I saw the movie (saw it today, and...AMAZING!) and I loved it. After watching the film, I can't imagine Howard Shore composing anything different. There are some cues which are re-used from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" but they are used for old and beloved (and not so beloved) characters, which makes complete sense. Why would you create a different theme for characters we met in the previous trilogy? On the contrary, the themes announce the characters' presence (elves, orcs, hobbits) before they come on screen. It lets the viewers know we're returning to a place we've been before. The new \\"Misty Mountains\\" theme is beautiful and gives off a sense of adventure and purpose. When you think about it in terms of music, it sounds very much like a company of dwarves out on an incredibly important quest. \\"Blunt the Knives\\" is a fun song that immediately brought a smile to my face the first time I heard it, and it shows us the boisterous and fun loving nature of the dwarves.<br /><br />The extended versions of the songs, as well as the bonus tracks, are a wonderful treat. \\"The Song of the Lonely Mountain\\" by Neil Finn is quite good. I was a little iffy about it at first when I'd only heard bits and pieces of the song. After hearing it in full, it's a delight to listen to. I won't compare it to Enya's \\"May It Be\\" or Annie Lennox's \\"Into the West\\" as it's different and unique in it's own way, but very much fits the feel of Middle Earth, just as the other two did. Listening to the soundtrack has an air of coming home about it, especially when the hobbit theme can be heard. You're coming back to a place you know very well, and though a little different than what you're used to (set 60 years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\"), it's still a place you recognize the look, feel, and sound of.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|If you like music and not the best on the piano, then I think you will like this one. It's interesting.
1452111014|5.0|A great look into the creative process that brought about this wonderful movie. My favorite sections went into all the rough concepts for Ralph (at one point he more closely resembled Magilla Gorilla than Ralph as we know him).
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Well written, and informative of the corruption and abuse to the people in North Korea. I personally was unaware that prison camps still exist in this day and age. Hopefully these stories will bring more awareness and put a stop to the inhumane behavior.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|All around another hit CD from Coldplay.  This is a bit of a departure from their other music, so if you really liked the quirkiness of their other music, especially that from Parachutes or A Rush of Blood to the Head, then you may or may not like this particular album.<br /><br />Among the best songs on this CD are Mylo Xyloto, Hurts Like Heaven, Paradise, Charlie Brown, Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, Major Minus, and Don't Let it Break Your Heart.<br />Disappointing is the brevity of Mylo Xyloto, A Hopeful Transmission, and M.M.I.X., as well as the CD as a whole, which is only about 45 minutes long.<br /><br />Also controversial is Princess of China, which features Rhianna.  Take it or leave it.  The bass drum in &#34;Up In Flames&#34; is also somewhat irritating, but that's completely a matter of preference.<br /><br />Those are small complaints compared to the whole product.  Personally, I'm enjoying the CD quite a bit. It may not top their song Viva La Vida, but there's still plenty to love.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Scary movie about the food industry and processed food. Makes you think about the food you buy and eat and make some changes in your diet and food purchases.
B003W77SAS|4.0|Pretty good CD, has plenty of great stuff on it. However, 5 of these songs are on the Flashback collection, and two of the bonus tracks (On The Run and Second Time Around) are between 40 seconds and a minute long.  The other bonus track, however, is very great, and catchy to boot.<br /><br />It all comes down to how big of an ELO fan you are: if you're after all their hidden gems, definitely worth it.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I really like this book and I think you should read this book because it is a good book to read if you have a cat.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Okay...let me even attempt to compose a review on this magnificent piece of 5+ star work. Honestly, writing this review is proving to be difficult for me. It's weird...I'm a rambler and love to talk, so reviewing usually comes easy. Not this time though. I feel like I need to choose my words carefully - I need to give this book a review that it SO deserves.<br /><br />I started reading Hopeless about 24 hours ago. It is my first read of Colleen Hoover's, but certainly won't be my last. Slammed and Point of Retreat have just found their way to the top of my TBR. I worked and entire shift today, but my mind was far away from the land of medical claims and billing....it was with Sky and Holder instead. Hopeless grabbed my mind, heart and soul instantly. It held on to it until the very last damn word. Flawless writing in every chapter, a story line like NONE other, characters that you will connect to; love. It really has it all. The twists, turns and surprises just keep coming. I would have never guessed what comes of Sky and Holder, but I was so curious from their first encounter. I frantically texted my best reading buddy...I was freaking out, making my assumptions...but I couldn't have been more wrong. ;)<br /><br />I don't want to say too much more about the plot, just that you NEED to read this. If EVER in your life, you've found yourself feeling hopeless, you need to read this book right now! The freakishly talented Colleen Hoover has made a fiction story appear in my head as though I lived it once. A 5-\\"star\\" rating doesn't seem like nearly enough....and as soon as you read this book, you'll catch the message behind that too.<br /><br />...ahhhhh, now my heart can resume beating at a normal rhythm

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 somewhat of a departure from Season 1. Acting is still outstanding but the tone has changed in the writing - it becomes more \\"soap-opery\\", pace quickens cutting back and forth from warfront to accommodate alot of storytelling as the war changes everything for the aristocracy and the commoners. Since Downton is a chronicle of aristocratic life in England colliding  with world changing events that change that life, and about class differences, the content of the series has to show an evolution in the characters. Some change, some we are shown, never will. But some of the characters \\"morphed\\" too quickly -ie, Mrs. Patmore is suddenly much brighter and wiser as though her better eyesight has made her more educated; the morally upright Lord Grantham chasing skirts... True they are reacting to the suffering of war, and to modernism, but the pace and fragmentation of the storyline hint at a need for the writer, Julian Fellowes, to appeal to a younger viewing audience. The introduction of the badly scarred \\"maybe\\" Patrick Crawley was a blunt artifice that didn't work. Yet the brilliant Maggie Smith as Violet remains the same, and anchors the ensemble. All in all I'm looking forward to Season 3 to see more character evolution, more \\"baddies\\" and more eccentric characters.

B0053FANS6|4.0|This blu-ray trilogy is a great way to encompass the entire Mummy trilogy. Unfortunately the third movie wasn't all that great and didn't really add anything to what the other two movies accomplished. Video quality and sound were great.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Tom Hooper (\\"The King's Speech\\") pulls out all the stops in this newest iteration of Victor Hugo's tome.  Adapted from the 1985 musical stage production by Cameron Mackintosh, the movie is large, loquacious and long.  One of the first things you'll notice is that each cast member handles their own songs and does it live...and in one take!  Not only that but Hooper puts his camera right in the face of the actor much of the time.  There isn't a tear, a spec of dirt or a nasal drip that goes unnoticed.  It's actually pretty remarkable.  The film is loaded with talent and every actor handles his or her music well and rarely misses a note.  And when they do, it is an emotional hic up which would be expected.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, the film takes place in Paris beginning in about 1815 and ends about 20 years later.  Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is a prisoner who has served 19 years of hard labor for stealing bread.  He is released but he is given papers that label him dangerous so no one will hire or house him.  Starving and freezing, he seeks refuge in a church.  He then steals several items of silver.  When caught, the priest says he gave them to him.  This second chance changes Valjean who changes his name, eventually becomes mayor and tries to do good in the world.<br /><br />One of his employees at the garment factory he owns named Fantine (superb Anne Hathaway) is summarily dismissed by a supervisor because she had a daughter out of wedlock.  Resorting to selling her hair and her body to care for her daughter she becomes seriously ill.  By coincidence, Valjean discovers his earlier slight and takes responsibility for Fantine's daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen then Amanda Seyfried).  Valjean is constantly dodging Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) who thinks he recognizes the now much different looking mayor.<br /><br />As Cosette ages she becomes smitten with a young firebrand named Marius (excellent Eddie Redmayne) who is one of the leaders of a fledgling people's rebellion.  One of the surprising (to me) standout performances comes from Samantha Barks in the role of Eponine, who is the daughter of a pair of inn keepers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) who housed Cosette when she was a young girl.  Speaking of Cohen and Carter, they provide some needed comic relief throughout the film as the thieves, scam artists and grifters to which they excel.<br /><br />So what, if anything, is wrong with this movie.  Not much, but I'll stick my neck out and say the music.  \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is probably the only standout song - OK maybe \\"On My Own\\" - and certainly it's hard to hold back tears when Hathaway delivers -  but other than that, nothing too memorable.  The lyrics certainly move the story along as they must.  Almost all the dialog is sung.  If you are familiar with the story, I suspect you will enjoy the film.  I did.ple's rebellion.

B001NOQI3U|5.0|Barbra Streisand has outdone herself with this film. Her musical and dramatic performances are astounding, but getting so much emotion and feeling and compassion from these characters is a true feat. This movie shows the depth of desire and is a brilliant advertisement for acceptance.

B005XLN97M|5.0|I have to admit that recent experience assembling the [[ASIN:B005XTLD40 Barbie Glam Pool]] had me approaching the assembly of this Barbie Beach House with some amount of trepidation. I'm quite pleased to report that this beach house provided easy to follow directions (almost entirely in pictures, which I usually hate, but it was perfect for this piece). In total, from opening the box to start of play, it took me and my 6 year-old thirty minutes to put the house together. It is quite a well-constructed set. The pieces snap in easily and fairly tightly, and my daughter (and her two year-old brother) have yet to take it apart, on purpose or accidentally.<br /><br />I really like the openness of the house. While it's designed to be playable on both sides, realistically, the kids want to use the rooms and the furniture in the rooms. My daughter is especially delighted with the toilet (though she has complained it fits the kid Barbies better than the adults). They're also intrigued by the stairs and the dual-purpose furniture that comes with the house (the kitchen counter/sink flips open to a counter; an upstairs sofa flips open to a bed).<br /><br />The house comes with lots of little accessories (cups, plates, soap/lotion bottles) that are really tiny. My daughter LOVES these, I hate them, as she is not very good about putting them away. However, the oven/refrigerator in the house have doors that snap shut fairly well, providing good storage space, which was good thinking on the toy designers' part.<br /><br />Overall, I can see this set getting a lot of play time, and, while it's pretty big, it's not a space hog and I think it will actually help to keep some of my daughters Barbies a little more organized. We're all quite pleased with the house, and I have to admit, that I'm enjoying playing with it myself.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|5 star classic comedy<br />Follows with the movies no better way for Kinney do it. 5 Stars across the board.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love the game its adorable and I love the show, but I am absolutely NOT paying an unnecessary amount of re money on this game.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|thank you for the offer I am sure that the game is exactly what I asked for a very good . item.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written beautiful story.  I wasn't able to put it down.  This story caused so much emotion, and it had a beautiful and hopeful ending.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|I thought I would like to try price w as s good free thank you I am sure I will like
B000FC12Z0|3.0|Agatha Christie is of course a wonderful writer. But not being fond of such murder and investigation stories I read this book just to learn about her style.
B0086700CM|5.0|thank you for the offer I have really enjoyed the game so far. I am sure I will be planning for quite awhile.
B007JGAR6U|5.0|I purchased this flash to use on my XPRO 1 along with the fuji 35mm, and 60mm lenses.  I can't understand why this flash has gotten low reviews. Works great on my gear, no complaints what so ever. If you use the product for what it was intended for, you wont have anything to gripe about.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I like this version of angry birds a different challenges and so on .thank you I am sure I will purchase more
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is the greatest free game I've ever come across. Definitely a must download for the Kindle. Do not hesitate for one second. You can pay if you want coins or gems, but you can get both for free in the game.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|2012-12-29
0307279189|5.0|It was an interesting read. I had recently started wearing minimalist shoes, and liked reading more about the science of running shoes. Seems like a good read for anyone who runs or loves a runner. I have given it as a gift to 2 people.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I loved this CD. Mr. Stewart has done it again!  Contains get Christmas classics and has some great duets, the one of Rod and Michael Buble doing Winter Wonderland is excellent.  Great crooners of our time!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas present for a soon to be retiring friend and it was perfect. She adored it. The price was even better online than it was in the department stores.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|Lego does it again. A great set that I can afford to buy my son and still get great mini figures he wants. Thanks!
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|I bought this for my 5 and 7 year old boys who love angry birds.  We play a lot with plush birds and assorted boxes in the hallway.  The idea of this game is awesome..the cards are fun and easy to follow but the blocks are SO difficult to build that I ended up having to build all the structures for the kids and had a very hard time doing it.  I got so annoyed with how hard the blocks are to stack!!.  The blocks are made in such a way that it is nearly impossible to make some of the structures without it falling down before being finished...over and over.  Definitely not a game the kids will be able to play by themselves.  The catapult really doesn't work very well either....very dissapointed!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|We are in a heck of a mess.  Good narration, interesting information, worth your time to watch.  No one administration has stemmed the non-sense, but have just perpetuated it.  I hope they can work things out, but doubtful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I received a kindle for Christmas and wanted to try it out, so was excited to see a Nicholas Sparks book I have not read yet available.  I have only read about 20 pgs, but like always with Nicholas Sparks books I cannot put it down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a great game,but it makes my head spin when I finish the game and the cards make a cool design.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|This app has a extensive list of sounds that can suit your need for either background sound, or for restful blocking of external noises while sleeping.
B004I744AS|4.0|i love this dictionary ...  ... ... this is a really nice resource at my fingertips on my kindle! !!!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This application does everything a good file manager should.  Safe and not prone to accidental file actions such as deletes.  Lets you see and manipulate (if necessary) the folder contents of the Kindle Fire.
B001H1SW4M|5.0|All the SAW movies are suspenseful and gory.  You never know who Jigsaws partner will be and then it always surprises you.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase.  It arrived promptly, packaged well, and the price was great.  Will deal again.
0812993357|5.0|What a fascinating person AND a great writer-not a combination you often find. I just wish the pictures were printed on better paper.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Hours worth of fun in that game.  The graphics are good, the self moving is easy, and it's llots of fun.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|My best kids' movie!!!<br />So much so, my kids would go bring in this movie if they wanted me to be happy,that kind of 'feel good movie',good buy with the digital copy also.
078322799X|5.0|Great movie of Michel J Fox, very dynamic, and let loose the breath of so much action that this film brings. One of the best J Fox
B008JGSM6G|4.0|each level increases difficulty. colors are intense. ability to undo choices. interesting patterns. easy to understand and play  good fun.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|I have been a big fan of BBC since the inception of the band.  When considering the talented musicians that comprise BBC, I could not imagine how they could not create music that is classic and timeless.  The reviews I have read on Amazon for their recent release \\"Afterglow\\" have been mixed, but in my humble opinion their new material is their best work to date.  Since becoming a fan I have realized early on that BBC's music requires repeat listenings before you can really grasp how exquiste and complex their music is.  At times I hear the Deep Purple influences which is understandable due to Glenn Hughes's participation, but at other times I hear strands of Led Zeppelin mixed in with Free which is not surprising since the late great Paul Kosoff (ex-Free), has been a huge influence on blues virtuoso Joe Bonamassa.  I believe with the releasae of \\"Afterglow\\" BBC has finally reached the apex of their powers.  The first (2) releases were both excellent pieces of work, but upon listening to \\"Afterglow\\" the music is more coheisive and their is a better blending of the talents within the band.  Favorite cuts are Midnight Sun, The Circle, and Crawl.  I strongly encourage all lovers of classic hard rock to pickup a copy.  I believe that you will be quite satisfied with your purchase!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Challenging and fun to unravel.  Lots of travel.  Good exercise in color.  Some serious thinking.  Had to keep remembering and checking which ones were done.  A pleasant time.
B00632HWOG|5.0|One of the first things I do in the morning is get my cup of coffee, turn on my Kindle, and check my email. You just click on it and there it is! It's very easy to read, delete, compose, and move emails. Adding new folders is simple as well. In fact, I think I like this better than signing on with my pc and waiting for everything to load. This app has no delays and is so easy to use. I love it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book.  A real page turner.  Shows who the true heros are.  A must read for anyone interested in hearing the side of the story not from Washington.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. Great character actors.  It was good to see a movie that was not &#34;over the top&#34; with action or comedy.  Drama's are hard to come by tese days
B007XHWROK|5.0|My daughter wanted this cd for her 12th birthday. It's not my style, but she LOVES it. Definitely a good purchase.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I've played a decent number if games like this and I have to say that thus is one of the better ones. Dungeon Hunter 3 is a basic hack and slash action game. The four classes are interesting and actually provide a variety in the gameplay which is refreshing to see. Like a lot of modern games there are perks if you buy certain things but it's fairly simple to do without them. Overall I would recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was by far the most amazing book I have ever read. It has love, neutrals, and kind of some mystery.
B007RTAR64|5.0|quality was great!  shipping was timely! I love this collectable doll.  my grandbaby loves it.  when she is happy we are all happy!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album definitely exceeded expectations and lived up to all the hype NME was giving it! Easily one of the best albums of the year.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Resident Evil: Retribution was a horrible movie.  I made a mistable in ordering.  The acting was poor.  The plot was lame.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a really fun and well made game. Some of the levels have a lot of depth. I will be playing this game for a long time. Worth every penny of $5.
B006R1T40I|4.0|I like almost everything Bonnie Raitt does.  some if this was a remake of old material, but that was ok.  In addition, it was nice to hear some pieces
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Fast paced and interesting. A little more predictable than the first one but I enjoyed it.<br />First book I downloaded on my kindle.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I Hate hate hate when I get into a game only to find out I have to pay more to unlock it but this game was worth it. Good story line, and overall fun game.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|Very entertaining.  Mindless fun, which is my favorite type of movie.  Mark and Mila are great together.  4 star fun!
B0086700CM|3.0|First off, I really enjoyed this game. I bought it on my phone first, then, purchased it again for my kindle. I have only 2 problems with it- one (technical), it froze at some pivotal points in my game causing me to die because it wouldn't let me input movements. Two (personal), it was so much harder to maneuver my character with my heavier device that I think it would be better if the motion activated parts were more \\"sensitive\\" for the tablet version. Otherwise, this game is a great time killer.occlusion, normal/bump map, etc.)... so maybe the devil's in the animation sequences(?) I wish someone out there would educate my ignorant mind. Anyways, it freezes and I die. VERY frustrating!<br /><br />  Last order of business, how in the world do the bad guys catch up to you when you have constant speed and agility- I mean, you NEVER slow down! I've gotten caught by them before I even had to jump up or under tree roots... it doesn't make rational sense.<br /><br />  Other than those 3 complaints, the game is indeed fun. I guess the re-playability factor is decent... I haven't played it long enough to see if there are different levels besides the tutorial's... but with the right amount of game coin, you can play as different players. Do they have different abilities, or do they just look different? Do they unlock different temples for different levels to take place, or do you have to run the first level over and over again? I wish I knew!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|What an awesome and fun game.  I love this game and it is so interesting to play.<br />Cute graphics and sounds.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This storyline was easy to get into, but the plot stalled out midway thru before picking up again with an unexpected twist at the end.  Worth reading, but not as exciting as earlier books (Firm, Pelican's Brief, etc) that compelled the reader to keep reading steadily throughout the entire book at a quicker pace.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I don't know why but I cannot remove this game from my Kindle.  I don't like having it on there permanently.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm so excited that I can change to the different types of Bibles.  I was able to get my favorite, the NIV, with just one \\"click\\".  Can't wait for Sunday Service and our Bible Studies.  Happy 2013 everyone!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The first half of the book was intriguing - so 2 stars for that.  The story line disintegrated into an impossibly unbelievable plot - no star for that. Too bad the girl wasn't really gone. Not one likable character to cheer for in the entire book.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|The characters are fun, the plot is pretty shallow so it's easy to just enjoy. We also like the music. A fun, relaxing movie.
0553381407|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read on connecting your past life experiences to what is happening now in your life.<br />If you need one good book to read - I would recommend this to be it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I played a similar game on my daughter's IPod and liked it.  This is even more fun than that - I am playing constantly!
B0063IH60K|4.0|For the basic solitare player, it is great. Good graphics, quick response and fine options. I would like to see some variations of the game included for a change of pace! Enjoyable pastime.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I used to listen to this cd so much that my girl would hide it from me or throw it in the back.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I really enjoy facebook. It's a great way for me to communicate, on a regular basis, with my friends and relatives no matter where they live or happen to be at any given time. I especially like the ability to use my computer, iphone and/or Kindle to update status and pictures that may be of interest to them at any time, at home or on the move! I also maintain two seperate pages. One for my hobby (antique/classic cars) and one for my favorite florist.
B008PNBU30|5.0|This cd was awesome. It was in great condition and an inexpensive price. I would do it all again. Mhmm.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not one of the best Grisham books I've read....plot similar to The Firm without the depth. Didn't really like the characters and would not recommend the book as a good read.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The trick technique is great. I know Tintin since my childhood. I own every single book of this series. Spielberg combined a couple of the stories, put new elements in it, and created so a nice family movie.
1419705849|5.0|Hit with son! Came in perfect condition. My son loves this series. That is all he wanted for Christmas! Great Book
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I was amazed at all the conflicting signals from neighboring routers.  This app helps locate the least busy channels for my router.  Also it can help you to visualize the dead spots in your house.  Sometimes just relocating your router can eliminate the dead spots.  Very useful app.
B0015AARJI|5.0|what can i say about this controller it works good, its a real sony playstation remote it does what it suppose to do
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Top notch app.  Shows how much time you have left for a variety of functions.  Really like how you can have it appear in the kindle menu.  Very convenient.
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|Its a must see comedy that you won't regret watching! It does seam to have a love story in there but the comedy totally out weights it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I don't suppose a lot of 20- or 30-somethings will appreciate this movie, but for this 60+ old lady, it touched me on so many different levels.  I laughed a lot, cried a few times and generally loved this gem.<br /><br />Casting was spot on, with many of my favorite actors (special kudos to Dame Maggie Smith!).  The dialogue was pithy and witty and deftly touched on many areas that seniors are having to deal with ... what to do with yourself when the 1st acts of your life are over?  self-worth when age is indicating you aren't worthy ... etc.<br /><br />I wish there were more like this for my demographic!  Highly recommended.  I rented, but will definitely be purchasing.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009CPJHY4 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book!  The main character, Charlie, is such an interesting character and the author did such a great job describing each one that I felt like I personally knew each character.
075669812X|5.0|Gave this to my grandson for Christmas and he loved it,  Everything a 10 year old Ninjago loving boy could ask for.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a fun game which is very addicting.  The levels are challenging, doesn't take much skill, and fun for any age.
B004PLWGVG|5.0|I LOVE FLORENCE!! THIS ALBUM IS ON CONTINUOUS REPEAT! SHE TRULY IS AN AMAZING ARTIST. DEEP LYRICS, THAT TOUCH THE SOUL
0385536828|2.0|Not that interesting - a pretty superficial character.  I thought this would be an espionage story. Not that at all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. I really enjoy being able to choose either random or winning. It's very addicting to say the least
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love the Friends series and this is the perfect package to get all of it! All sorts of additional footage and outtakes. This boxed set has hours and hours of entertainment all neatly packaged and well presented! Fantastic buy for the money.
0553266306|5.0|This is an interesting book the way it lays the scene and then builds on it. Truly a classic! I listened to the audio book and the reader was wonderful. very understandable with the right intonations. I listen in my car on my commute and I couldn't wait  to begin each time I headed for road!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites, one of those I want to see again and again, the characters are played by classic British actors and the story is something I can relate to as a travel agent who has been to India.  It is life as lived by retirees searching for a home in their retirement years, love as experienced by the young man who owns the hotel and his girl friend, and so much more. Happy, sad and everything in between.<br />I've seen it 2 times, once in the theater and then I bought it and I never buy movies and I never watch hardly any movie twice or three times. This is a feel good movie and my book club loved it, we had an authentic Indian food lunch prepared by my friend from India and watched the movie together.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This works very well for reading my emails.  I am able to access yahoo mail right from my Kindle Fire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is super addicting. Once I started, I could not stop. I told all of my friends about this app and they all became addicted and loved it!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This was easy to download and works well.  This is my favorite search engine; I use it every day on my laptop.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book!!! Definitely wish it wouldn't have ended!! I could tell from the beginning it was going to be a great read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and have really enjoyed playing it.  This is a great game that I enjoy.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|A beautifully executed model which has both style and substance. Our 3 year old grandchild carries it everywhere by the tail(great handle). He is getting to know many of the Dinosaur by look and name but T-Rex is his favorite. Schleich does a great  modeling job.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a fun and addictive game that I downloaded on my Kindle Fire.  It works just fine for me.
B001AQT0RC|3.0|Excellent film, the image quality is very good, the audio option in Spanish is just directed to the public in Spain with Spanish accent, not neutral Castilian or latin<br /><br />Excelente película, la calidad de imágen es muy buena, la opción de audio en español esta dirigida para público de España, con acento español, no en castellano neutral o latino
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this on my iphone as well and I use it often. Its pretty accurate. You can also get weather for other states to check on family if they don't live in the same state as you.
1932100660|5.0|This is a short & sweet review.  If you believe that people should be able to maintain good health and a high quality of life until they die of natural causes in their twilight years, THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ.<br /><br />The only technical book I have ever read in my life that held my interest and had me completely intrigued from cover to cover.<br /><br />IT IS AN EYE-OPENER!!!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is the Shiiiiiiit, Hilarious Af, need to watch it to believe it. Worth the money and definitely the time.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. Named my daughter after one of these song. I love fleet wood Mac
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was very entertaining and full of humor.  I enjoyed it very much. That's why I am a fan of romance books.
B000M02M2M|5.0|Beautiful colors and beeswax to boot!  Crayola may have all the colors in the world, but these provide much more beautiful colors.  Recommend!
B0086700CM|4.0|It's cool! You should try it! Can you survive a chase with evil demon monkeys? I couldn't get the wallpapers to work,though.There are no advertising either! It is also free! It is a good game!    Lego man
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|At the age of 42, I can't figure out why I never read this as a child.  I have read it twice already to my six year old who loves it.  I thoroughly enjoyed as well.  Recommend!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a amazing book! I seen the  movie first but there are still many amazing surprises. Can't wait to read part 2!!!!!!!!
B000FCKRDI|3.0|I have read the entire wallflower series and while I like the series, and this book was okay, it wasn't my favorite. Worth reading, but the first book was better, imo.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book made me contemplate my views on multiple parts of life. It was a fantastic book. Extremely relatable. So glad I read it.
0062124293|2.0|Oh, I was mislead. Moran has written an entertaining book, as others have mentioned, well-suited to the 30-something set. But it's not a comedic romp or even a steady-handed feminist read. I found myself skimming many of the chapters, looking for the good bits. I found the chapter on abortion to be the very best part of the book with her musing on motherhood to be the second best - this coming from me - a woman who has never had, or wanted to have, children. So, you may or may not enjoy it, but for a little over ten bucks here on Amazon, you might want to take a chance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book!!!!<br />Can't wait to download and read the next one. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an awesome read
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am pleased with the quality of this pack!  My daughter loves it, and can now carry all her camera equipment in one place!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This dictionary has a great variety of words. But sometimes I would like to know what all the new words mean. I think the creator of this dictionary should create a slang dictionary full of all the new words and phrases that people say today.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is probably the best SLENDER MAN game I ever played! Never thought it would b  on my new kindle fire. Although you do have to hold your kindle or android thingy at an angle because it's upside down when u hold it sideways. PLEASE FIX!!!
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I've used Avast on PCs for several years but was concerned over all the negative reviews in the Amazon &quot;Appstore&quot; for its use on the Kindle Fire, but since virtually all were from over 6 months ago I thought I'd take a chance. Evidently the problem with downloading virus definition updates was resolved months ago.<br />No problems installing it from Amazon. Hopefully I will not ever have to see how it handles malware on my KF.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This booked had me instantly hooked! I'm on Christmas vacation and I literally read this book starting in the afternoon one day into the the next day till about 6 am. I literally could not put it down. I love all the tragic fallout's and when they'd find their way back every time. Truly a great read!!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one in April!!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Cannot beat the price.  Download the iPhone app for lots of fun with the kids.  A good holiday movie for the family.
B007LB2B3K|5.0|Keeping up with their unlimited musical stylings, they've mixed it up a little heavier and alot more melodic. As I've stated before, unlimited musical talents.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of the best games I had ever played and I have it fir xbox 360 and I will tell you this game is worth 6.99 and you so will love it like I do.
B001AMWTAG|5.0|Ican't wait to hear what they come out with next. They use multiple musical styles and don't limit themselves to one genre.
