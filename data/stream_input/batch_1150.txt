B004FOA84A|4.0|Highly entertaining. I too would like a longer version. Did have a few FCs on my Droid Incredible, but simply relaunching worked fine. A couple of times I was stumped pretty good and had to give it a bit of thought but for the most part it was pretty straightforward and I finished in an afternoon. I hope there's more to come, more complex and longer to play. :)
0307477479|3.0|I wanted to like this book. It's well written, innovative, and took me back to a San Francisco time and place of beloved and intriguing memories. The shifting back and forth in time I managed to maneuver and even appreciate. However, when the power-point chapter arrived, my desire to assimilate all the far-flung information and arrival of new characters reached its end. To be sure, trying to read it as an e-book didn't help, since not even a magnifying glass was enough to counteract the dimness of the letters. Had I been reading it in hardback book form, however, this imagery would still have been one twist too many. Gimmicks I expect in mystery novels. The only mystery in this was why the author, who is a very good writer, would choose to use this in hers. I tried to continue reading, but--sorry to say--I finally quit and haven't picked it up again.
0060254920|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time.  When I was little I used to beg my dad to read it to me as my bedtime story.  It is the kind of book that lets you imagine what is happening.  Maurice Sendak leaves some of the pages wordless and just has pictures of different scenes.  My dad used to ask me, \\"Kaitlynn, what do you think is happening in this part of the book?  Can you tell this part of the story?\\"  Everytime he asked me that I would make up something different.  It made it feel like he was reading me a different book everytime I he read it to me.  I think this is a wonderful book to read to a classroom.  It also has great word choice and great illustrations.
1594202842|4.0|A fascinating account. And the book raises an important question: Is America's assumed educational mediocrity really the fault of our public schools (as some believe) or is it the fault of an epidemic of indulgent parenting (as others believe)?  Asian kids seem to do remarkably well in the public schools, commonly carrying off the top academic awards and raising little complaint about the quality of the schools. Consequently, it does cast this important debate in an interesting new light. From which do we suffer, poor schools or weak parents?
B004LAIU4I|5.0|My review is not about the music but the format to buy it in. First off I give this release five stars and agree with the glowing comments of other 5 star reviewers. If you are into 180 gram vinyl but at the same time digitally inclined then consider buying the vinyl version of this release. If you don't have a turntalbe that will convert vinyl to MP3 files and thus on to a program like ITunes, it comes with access to a free 24 bit 96khz high resolution audio download of the album which also contains a bonus of the live rehearsal version of So Beautiful or So What Track. I am very happy with the sound quality of the vinyl and for about five extra bucks I have a wonderful album cover to put in a album cover frame and hang it in the interior of my home.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Jaws(1975) is a classic Steven Spielberg movie based on the suspense novel by Peter Benchley. Sheriff Brody(Roy Scheider), shark hunter Quint(Robert Shaw), and marine biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) hunt a shark that's preying on people near Amity Island. Jaws was a critical and commercial success and it spawned three sequels. The filmmakers put most of the emphasis on the shark while the novel had many subplots. Hooper had an affair with Martin Brody's wife in the novel. In the Jaws movies, Ellen Brody is a more sympathetic character. The scene where \\"Chrissie\\" is killed by a shark while swimming was spoofed in Steven Spielberg's 1941(1979)! Jaws has been spoofed in movies and TV shows. There's a Jaws spoof in the 1976 Hong Kong comedy Mr. Funny Bone(Lo Fu Ji). A boy wears a Jaws T-shirt in Picardia Mexicana(1978). Jaws was ripped off in Great White(1981) and Shark Attack 3(2001). John Williams' music score for Jaws is a classic in itself. Jaws(1975) is a classic Hollywood movie.
0374158460|1.0|This book represents 561 pages of painful boredom.  Every single character predictably abandons their closely held beliefs in order to join the dark side.  It is a book with with many characters with the same character flaw - self absorbtion.  The few moments of revelation and redemption were not beliveable or satisfying.  The author relies on political cliches and stereotypes, but makes both liberals and conservatives to be equally dense, which left me wondering if the point was to encourage one not to get involved or give a damn.  I kept reading, believing that there had to be some truth to all the hype, and because I found The Corrections highly worthwhile.  However, Franzen's Freedom was old and tired, one begins with not liking the characters and concludes the book feeling the same way.  I was hoping for some sort of explosion, (terrorist attack perhaps?) that would take out every single character.    As a side note, never read the book after a good meal.  Franzen takes great pleasure in being needlessly gross.  Plenty of descriptive bowel movements, flatulence, sewage, unappetizing sex scenes, etc.  The author clearly enjoys the power of turning the reader's stomach.    Frankly, the entire work left me with a feeling of disgust.  I even like myself less for staying with it and finishing the book, instead of finding something worthwhile to do - like alphabetizing my spices, or learning to speak Vulcan.

B00509ODFO|5.0|My first introduction to the Stargate franchise (outside the original movie) was Atlantis.  I have to admit that I didn't watch it under legitimate means.  I like to rationalize this by saying it was because I didn't have cable, didn't want to be locked into a specific viewing time, and didn't want to wait for it to come out on DVD.  I can't help but think that the target audience, for a show like SGU, may have a disproportionate number of viewers who still watch it in ways that don't bring in money, and may have been it's downfall.  For that, I am saddened.  And being that I have now watched everything SG (through legitimate means this time) I hope that there is still a place in the market for more SG programing.  Best of luck to the cast, crew, and fans.  Thanks for everything and I hope to see (pay for) a SGU or SGA movie soon
B004CAWKXE|5.0|Danger Days is a redirection by MCR, following the epic goth/angst driven Black Parade.  This disc is supposed to be a concept album, but nevermind the goofy threads tying it together.  The songs are powerful, fist pumping anthems.  I can't believe Na Na Na didn't get more airplay than it did.  It's a phenomenal track that sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Lying below the surface of these songs is an optimistic, fun driven spirit.  I'm glad they didn't try to do a sequel to the Black Parade.  I think this one outshines their breakthrough, and ought to be given much more recognition than it's gained so far.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|This case provides ample protection for day to day use.  I like the easy access to buttons it provides and the fact I can place my iPhone in a dock with the case still on.  Considering I bought it for $5 when it was temporarily reduced in price, I consider it a fantastic deal, but at the current price of $9 it's still a fair price.
0596805527|4.0|This book is called 'the definitive guide' for a reason: it is by far the most complete book on Javascript that you can buy. Every subject, from syntax to popular libraries is covered. The 6th edition is completely updated to reflect the latest standard, ECMAscript 5. The newest features such as localstorage and geolocation are explained in this new edition. The book follows a clear outline. It starts by explaining the language and it's syntax, followed by it's features. Next is the usage of the language, both as a client-side language and as a server-side language. The book also covers the most popular Javascript library: jQuery.    I found the book, although it is written as a reference, easy and entertaining to read. The book is a great resource to use while developing Javascript, because every little detail is covered. A good indication of its quality is that the book survived five editions and is still going strong! What I did miss is some guidance around real world Javascript development and tooling. The book does not explain anything around unit testing, development environments and other useful tooling. That would be a welcome addition for the 7th edition!

0316069353|1.0|Great books. But this is now firmly the 21st century and the publishers might have heard of these e-book things. Take your heads out of the sand and wake up. We like Michael Connelly but we'd like him better on Kindle
B001IF252M|1.0|HELP!     First for those of us who are not IT pros, you will need at least 1 additional cable from this port to your TV to view anything on TV.  When I received this little device, I had to take it to the Apple store to learn what else I needed.  They sent me to Best Buy for a male to male cable (about $20).  This fat black cable (marked VW-1) connects from the PC port on the TV  to the little white Apple connecter.    OK, once all hooked up and on Amazon's streaming video page, I watched 2 old movies. Wow. The sound came out of the computer and the volume level was very low but the picture was on the TV and so were my desktop icons - all simultaneous.  Great!  Back at the Apple store they told me I needed more cables to get the sound to come out of the TV and to go back to Best Buy!  This step I haven't taken because of the following.    Next time I tried to use my laptop to watch a movie on TV nothing works. There is a live feed from computer to TV but my MacBook icons (on the laptop screen) are all fuzzy and pages are extra large.  The TV screen displays a blank MacBook desktop - no icons or folders.  When I go to stream a video (tried Amazon and Hulu) they do not display at all on the TV or only the right edge of the Amazon page displays on the left side of my TV screen.  Plus all my desktop folders are now scrambled and all over the MacBook screen.   No amount of page size adjusting in the MacBook System Preferences seems to change anything on the TV. While connected I cannot use my mouse to change the page size or move the page on the computer or TV.       My TV is a Sharp with HDMI ports, but the black cable (VW-1 or AWM) connects only to the PC port.    I understand this may not be fault of the Apple adapter. Once disconnected from my MacBook, my laptop is back to normal except for the desktop icons.      Any guidance on the streaming video problem would be really appreciated.

B003O86MY8|4.0|Rock Symphonies is a wonderful cd.  David does an amazing job of infusing classical violin into modern rock - too much fun!
B0049OSQ0Y|5.0|I knew I loved this record within seconds of playing it. A departure from the \\"rock opera\\" style of Hazards of Love, the King is Dead adds a folksy feel (harmonica!) while continuing to display Colin Meloy's lyrical mastery. Start with: June Hymn, Calamity Song.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I am wholly disappointed in the fault-finding reviews for this movie on Amazon.  Even the product description commentary is laden with negativity.  \\"The movie falls apart\\" ... \\"unnecessary musical numbers\\" ... \\"B movie\\" ... and the list goes on.  This movie is a winner, from start to finish.  The biggest flaw I found was the lack of insight on the part of the critical reviewers.      The movie engages the viewer from the opening scene, with a creaky-wheeled cart keeping time with an upcoming dandy of an opening song.  The corny, over-the-top kitchiness is charming and witty.  Not concerning itself with its own original musical numbers, the movie collects favorites hailing from the basic time period in which the story is set and cleverly interweaves them with both novel fresh songs and an engaging soundtrack.  The plot is predictable only in that it is hilariously unpredictable, like a great ride harpooning yesteryear's approach to cinema.  The colors are vibrant as are all the characters.  And the comedic timing is pure genius.    If you're looking for a movie to celebrate the gifted American musical, you will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend Thoroughly Modern Millie ... an \\"A movie\\" punctuated with a wink, a smile, and several entertaining dance numbers in an elevator.
014144116X|5.0|This is a classic tale by E.M. Forster about the clash of cultures in British India after the turn of the century.  This book is one series of misunderstandings after another that ironically convey the feelings of people in these places at the time.  The most dramatic misunderstanding of the book leads to a very harsh and dynamic climax that leads readers to really understand the repercussions of what was happening in India at the turn of the century.     At first I found E.M. Forster's writing style to be very different and it took me some time to get used to the way he writes.  I don't think I can accurately describe how he does it but his topics are so to the point but still portray so much meaning and depth.  Once I got used to this style, I found this book to be beautifully written and crafted with the perfect balance of humor and irony plus times of complete sadness, anger and despair. Similarly, the cast of characters in the book are all rich from the enlightening Dr. Aziz, and the naïve Adela Quested to the characters that display the most humanity: Mrs. Moore, Mr. Fielding and Professor Godbole. I can understand perfectly why this book is considered to be one of the important reads of the 20th century as it gives readers a very clear and dramatic picture of what India must have been like during British occupation.      Even though E.M. Forster claims that one can never understand India or describe what it is really like, I felt like I was able to get a very accurate portrayal through the eyes of all of the characters in this book as they all see aspects of the land, times and the native people differently.
B004NOH9LW|2.0|I figured by the ratings it may not be that good but it looked interesting, but turned out to be just disapointing. It had a great beginning, interesting middle and disapointing ending.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|The latest effort by the Foo Fighters Wasting Light is not only one of the best album ever from Dave Grohl and company, it certainly is the best sounding by far. As much as I have enjoyed all of the previous efforts, the production quality has seemed harsh on some. The analog quality that came out of the home studio is excellent.  This is without question, the best rock album I have heard in years. An instant classic!    Depending on your your personal taste, there are so many tracks anyone could call their favorite on Wasting Light, with the exception of \\"Back and Forth\\" which is the only track on the album that isn't on par with the rest (but still not a bad tune).  \\"Dear Rosemary\\" could be the perfect single and the added vocals throughout from Bob Mould add some flavor not heard on previous Foo efforts.      The first two tracks \\"Bridge Burning\\" and \\"Rope\\" hit like a sledge hammer and leave you wanting more. The fourth track \\"White Limo\\" literally explodes bringing a completely different feel than the previous songs. \\"Arlandria\\" is another one of the Foo songs that capture every possible hook to make you listen. \\"These Days\\" is a powerful rocker with great lyrics, which just another reminder of the talent Grohl has as a writer.  Just when you suspect that the rest of the album could just be mediocre comes the incredible \\"I Should Have Known\\" a song that demands repeated listening. The final track \\"Walk\\" is simply put, possibly the perfect way to end the almost perfect album. Just incredible lyrics delivered in the classic Dave Grohl style.    Buy this disc!!!!!

B004NSULHM|4.0|I hesitated on purchasing this CD becausing of reading the reviews here in Amazon.  I'm not a huge Radiohead fan or a fan of this type of music but this CD is good and takes a few listens to grow on you.  It's not a recording that you rock out to in the car but something you listen to with a pair of headphones while relaxing, to capture everything that is going on.  I am a huge metal fan (Behemoth, Slayer, Ishahn, Volbeat, Gorgoroth, etc...) but just found two new artist to enjoy, Mogwai (Just saw them live...Killer) and Radiohead...

B004QK5N5W|5.0|Though released with the iPad 2, this adapter will, in fact, pipe both video and audio out of an iPad 1 and an iPhone 4  through HDMI without any problem as long as the app you wish to view supports it.    My main interest in this adapter was to have the ability to watch Netflix streaming on family TVs who do not have Internet service. The Netflix app works beautifully over AT&T 3G connections on both the iPad and iPhone 4, but I wished to have a way to use the service at older family member's houses who do not have Internet of any sort. I had read most of the reviews here on Amazon and done some other digging around, but no one was very clear as to what this adapter could and could not do on older hardware. Here's my assessment to date:    iPad 2 - You get true \\"mirroring\\" performance. This essentially means that whatever you see and hear from the iPad 2 on screen gets put through the HDMI connection, including the home screen icons, sound effects, etc. This is what the adapter was created for.    iPad 1 - When plugged in, you do not get to see anything on the TV screen, but the TV will recognize that it is receiving an HDMI signal. It will simply be blank. The iPad 1 screen will behave normally until you open an app that is compatible with video/audio out and that's when the magic starts. In the Netflix app, which is the only one I've tested so far, you still get the menus and whatnot on the iPad 1 screen as always, but as soon as you start playing streaming video, the iPad 1 screen displays a red screen with the Netflix logo. All the video and sound gets piped through the HDMI output to the TV.    I did not have sophisticated testing equipment or ability to display the signal's resolution on the TV, but the resolution appears to be, at least for iPad 1, 720p. There was no distortion or stretching of the picture and it filled the TV screen properly with very small horizontal bars to keep the aspect ratio correct. With three bars of signal, the movie streamed justfine and quality was perfectly viewable with no grossly obvious compression artifacts. Better than VHS and loosely in the ballpark of DVD (though upconverted to 720p, apparently).    iPhone 4 - I tried the same thing on my iPhone 4. It all works essentially the same as on an iPad 1, which makes perfect sense given the similarities in hardware. I did notice much worse compression artifact errors, though, when output to TV. My guess is that the video signal being streamed to the iPhone 4 is scaled down to fit the small screen, where such artifacting would be less noticeable, and that this small-screen version does not scale well to a 42\\" HDTV. Though both sound and video were output just fine, the quality of the video left much to be desired. In fact, I would describe the video as essentially unwatchable.      It's my understanding that other apps work essentially the same. I don't have a list of apps, other than Netflix, which will work in this way. I wouldn't be surprised if the YouTube app, iPod video, etc. worked and even possibly a game or two. My main need was Netflix, and it works just fine for that purpose.      The adapter itself has two ports, one HDMI female port and one standard female iPod connector port. This permits you to power/charge the iPad or iPhone while simultaneously outputting video and audio. Not included, of course, is an HDMI cable. I would suggest you get at least a 3' cable, possibly a 6' cable, with which to connect to the TV or projector since you'll have to account for needing to physically manipulate the touch screen to start up video output. Build quality is typical Apple, which is to say excellent.    Very pleased with my gamble to purchase this. Didn't want others to have to worry if their intended use was similar.
B004856SQ8|4.0|Casting for this movie was spot on. The movie was fun to watch. A good mixture of action and comedy all throughout the movie.
0375507256|5.0|This novel is a fantastical, whimsical, philosophical, puzzle story unlike anything I've ever read and has easily become one of my all time favorites. The writing is brilliant and the ideas contained within are important themes. I look forward to re-reading it at some point as I think it's one of those books that you discover more and more with each reading. I finished it last night and feel sad this morning that it has come to an end.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|The movie itself was what one would expect. Although it was dark in its story as well as many of the scenes, the story didn't disappoint. Can't wait for the final chapter. But, I gave it four stars because the three-disc edition did not make clear that the \\"Special\\" disc was only in blu-ray. I don't have a blu-ray player. The only solution, according to Amazon is to return the entire package for a refund and reorder it in regular DVD.
B003ODL004|5.0|If you are into eerie, spine-tingling audio then this is your album.  Typical Zimmer fare and if you are a fan of the movie, you will love how the images pop into your head when you hear unforgettable moments, such as the \\"kick\\" music and others.

7119005901|5.0|This translation of \\"Three Kingdoms\\", one of China's four great classical novels, is extremely accurate and reads excellently and fluently.  Roberts finds a middle ground between fidelity and spirit.  The language used is not archaic, yet the translation is faithful.  It remains one of the best translated texts of Chinese literature ever.  Roberts must be congratulated for translating a book that reads as well as it did in the original written six centuries ago.    Trouble is, the version Roberts translated wasn't, textually, what Luo Guangzhong really wrote.  It was a text embellished by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang at the start of the Qing Dynasty circa 1660, 150 years after the most ancient extant text was established, that of the Jiajing Renwu edition (1522).  The 1522 edition (preface dated 1494) is known as the \\"Sanguo Tongsu Yanyi\\" (abbreviated TS by Roberts).    All credit to Roberts, he discusses, with great scholarly attentiveness, the differences between the 1660s Mao edition and 1522 Jiajing Renwu (Tongsu) edition in an informative afterword.  Roberts said that the differences and literary merits were disputed amongst scholars.  But for people wanting to read a version truer to Luo Guanzhong's vision, the Maos' version is certainly an embellishment, if not an outright revision.  The differences are not minor.    The question we should ask today is, should we be reading the Maos' revision of the original novel in c. 1660, or Luo's own (written around 1400)?  There are people who advocated the Mao version as the superior, more literary edition.  This is no different from scholars who used to \\"edit\\" Shakespeare to make him more palatable to the tastes of their times.      What the Maos did was to add their own judgments to the text.  Luo's TS version of 1522 paints a more accurate historical version of the characters, from the historical annals Sanguo Zhi.  Some people may argue the characters might be drier, but the Maos' changes reflect their own tastes and political allegiances.  The Maos were clearly pro-Liu and anti-Cao.  Cao Cao became Public Enemy No 1, Liu Bei the embodiment of righteous dynastic rule; Guang Yu and Zhuge Liang were deified.  They divided the book into 120 chapters (the TS version was in 24 scrolls and 10 parts each (ie. 240 parts). The Maos changed 10-20% of the text.  The effect is cumulative in such a long work as Three Kingdoms.  The characterizations are changed quite drastically.    To Roberts' credit, he does provide footnotes where the 1660 revised edition differs from the 1522 version.  He is right too that the Maos edition remains the most printed and read version in China, such was its influence.  But to go back to the root of Luo Guanzhong's vision, one must translate the 1522 edition.    Frankly, the 1660s version isn't that bad.  It's an embellished version, more literary, and may suit certain people's tastes better.  For one thing, the line: \\"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide\\" isn't in the older version.  But since the 1522 edition almost definitely represent Luo's work more faithfully, readers should have their selection.  Since Professor Shen Bojun's magisterial edition of the Jiajing Renwu version appeared nearly two decades ago (which corrects technical errors, ie. errors in dates etc), the task shouldn't be that arduous.  80% of the text is already in the 1660s version.  Voice of hope, however idealistic: give us the Jiajing Renwu version and the Sanguo Zhi (the full historical annals) please, Mr Roberts!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I can't say much besides what has already been said.  I have not heard an album like this, especially from a 20 year old band, for a long time.  Big Whiskey was a great album but not pure rock.  Backspacer was a great album as well but not a 95db album.  This is a rockin' 95db album.  I have to go back to my 60s and early 70s stuff to find something equivalent.  Layla and Other Love Songs comes to mind, but yet you could just as easily say Paranoid works here as well.  Buy it and enjoy, the gods of rock are quiet but roar to life on occasion; this time through the Foo Fighters.

B003Y5H55G|1.0|I agree with J. Hernandez and SK Williams, so, if you want to comment on how I am a horrible Fundy who can't take a joke, go ahead. It won't change the review.    That said, the movie really didn't grab my attention. I went as a Friend  wanted to see it, and for the first 30 or so minuets when it was just the  Two guys on a Road Trip it was OK, but not great. Please don't tell me I  don't understand British Humour, I do, and am English. Still, you saw two nerds in an RV having Mildly amusing encounters with Locals.  It was more TV calibre light sitcom than feature Film, but I thought this  was just set-up so bore with it. Finally, when they meet the Alien, things  pick up, and the Introduction to Paul was well done.      But, Paul got old. His constant cursing and his fully acclimated to Earth  personality really didn't seem that Funny. I mean sure, I can buy that  after 60 years on Earth he's not going to act all that Alien, but he was  in a Military base and he develops a pot head slacker persona?  Really? It was just implausible and not in the funny way, and to be honest the pot using slacker whose nonetheless wise and highly intelligent just seems to be too common and not really that interesting.    Still, it retained the Sitcom level quality so I decided to stick it out and have a few laughs at what I now knew to be a forgettable film.    Then they had to introduce Ruth, the Fundamentalist Christian Stenotype, and her gun toting Father. Ruth is repressed, and unhappy because of her Christianity which prevents her from doing any fun stuff but sticks with it. She's a Brainwashed victim of a Patriarchal and condoling father and its all the fault of Christianity.    Of course, Paul sets her free by showing her Evolution is True and Alien Life exists and therefore God doesn't exist. The fact that there are Christians that accept Evolution, or that have no problem with Alien Life, seems to elude the filmmakers. Then again, one of their arguments about it was that ifman was made in Gods Image, whose Image was Paul made in? This is a key argument.    The argument was stupid as Paul is actually Humanoid and so has the same basic shape as a Human. The filmmakers went out of their way to make Paul very Human acting, too. So, really, its not that much of a tretch to see the same designer in Paul, which makes the whole argument Ironic. This of course overlooks that the Image of God man is suppose to be in is not his Physical form, but I digress... I mean, the movie also says that Creationists like Ruth believe the Earth is only 4000 years Old, which is off by 2000 Years. Yes I know, 2000 years is nothing to the billions earth has been around and all but, it's a massive difference given recorded History would disprove a 4000 year Old Earth, which also contradicts the Biblical Timeline used by young Earth creationists.    Ruth is basically a Strawman. She exists to represent Christianity and thus allow Paul and his Atheistic beliefs demolish her and show her, and the audience, how wrong these beliefs are, but they don't represent what real Christians in general, or even real Young Earth creationists, believe and the Writers of the Film simply don't bother to do any research at all.    Of course she's much happier as an Atheist and now curses like a sailor and looks forward to fornicating.    The law was also not much use in this film. I mean, it is true that in one Scene a man in his 30's goes into a comic book shop to put his hands down the pants of an Alien Display, which in reality is Paul the Alien. He does this whilst giggling like a schoolgirl and talking excitedly about \\"Space Man Balls\\".     It made no sense. In fact, the way these two were depicted as 9th grade boys in he body of 30something men working for the NSA is just proof positive that the film sacrifices credibility of the sake of juvenile Humour and it just falls flat.    The endless references to Sci Fi may have been fun but, they don't work here. Not really. The gayjokes got stale. None of this was fresh, original, or entertaining.    The resolution was just trite and predictable and they yet again took another stab at Christianity via the gun toting Father with a gaze that shows both his empty mindedness and insanity, and it just got worse by Paul's own irreverent dismissals, Ruth telling him he set her Free, and they discussing how hopeless \\"Those people (Christians) are.    The Christian Bashing set this movie over The Top for me. Its not the only thing I hated though. The endless profanity, and the juvenile toilet Humour really didn't advance he plot any and just came off as stupid. The inclusion of Christianity, though, took it past a forgettable bad movie and into the realm of offensive hate speech.    Paul just was not funny, and the inclusion of the Christian bashing just made this more torture than fun.    I really can't imagine them taking pot-shots at anyone else like this with The Movie escaping scathing criticism for being hateful.
0061980269|4.0|I always heard about this film but never saw it.  I bought the book but did not read it as yet.   Sure I will enjoy it as much as other readers who read it already.
0517548232|1.0|This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for our son and daughter-in-law who are building their Disney DVD library for their new daughter.
0307279189|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It was recommended by a friend who is a barefoot runner, and was looking to change my mind on the physics of natural runners vs cushioned runners. I completed it in two days (mind you I work 60hrs a week) and have since changed my way of thinking and altered my running habits. Though I do not run barefoot I have started using minimal cushion and have notice an improvement not only on my posture but also the change in my stride and my recovery time.
0618001905|5.0|The book was a great read. Sad to think that this really happened just a hundred years ago. Would recommend for a quick read!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|My son and I loved this, it instantly became a game of how many horror/sci-fi movies you could find in it.  Since I'm older, I won.  At one point I thought I could almost hear Dr. Clayton Forrester running through the flaming streets of the city yelling for Bilderbeck and Sylvia. (War of the Worlds - 1953)   My son also saw some stuff borrowed from some of his video games, and so the race between us was often close.  I was hoping to hear some Krell music along the way in this show, but alas, there was none.      I found this movie entertaining, but I can see why some people hate it.  To me, this movie proves that Dr. Harold Medford was right..  We certainly haven't seen the last of Them.   It's nice to see a show that captures so much of the past.
B0050XFXT0|5.0|Bravo for The Doctor! All the creators, characters, and crews, old and new.<br />To take a relationship that's been growing and evolving for 700, 48, & 6 years and put it all together in one neat, delightful package, is a feat.<br />There's always been the sense and implication that the T.A.R.D.I.S was more than a machine and that The Doctor wasn't really the one in charge.  The confirmation and consummation of that relationship was brilliant.  Idris/Sexy is just what I expected her to be, just as funny & flippant & mad as The Doctor.  She stole a thief and ran off to see the universe, and don't they make a pair.  Loved the part when he accused her of being unreliable and she hit back with always taking him where he was needed.  That moment embodied the whole of the series past and present.<br />And the line about bringing home strays was spot on.<br />Bravo for the mad man and his magnificent time machine.
0451529065|3.0|I was completely surprised by the nature of Darwin's book.  I expected a book of science, but instead found it to be more of a book of philosophy.  Darwin had a vast knowledge of the natural world based on his personal observations and the observations of other natural scientists.  In his book he describes interesting phenomenon and attempts to explain a natural, random process by which these things could occur.  He was smart enough to recognize the limitations of his explanations, and tried to deal with them with more theories of how his ideas could work despite their obvious shortcomings.  Unfortunately, his preemptive arguments come across as somewhat strained and difficult to believe.  As a result, I found his theories interesting, but not necessarily compelling.  Darwin's book reads more like the musings of Plato then a work of science.
B0031P6X2K|5.0|Ok, Got this and the next two Stevie albums from Sundazed and tracked this one yesterday. Oh Boy, what a Joy!!  Fidelity is just nirvana. Full Rich and spot on. Very quiet pressing. Not 180 gram, more like 150, but flat, on center  and again, very quiet surface! Very well remastered and well pressed album!  Sundazed is to be commended on this one! The only negative is the paper inner which you should carefully extract  the record from and then toss it and replace it with a good rice paper inner sleeve. But this is what Audiophile  pressings should all sound like!!  Gerard Masters
159420229X|3.0|A few years ago a tyre manufacturer started an advertising campaign based on the fact that its tyres were being used on F1 circuits by the best pilots in the world. A competing brand saw this as a faux pas and and replied with ads saying something to the effect of \\"If you need tyres that last for less than two hours while driving at 300km/h in a loop, then our competitor's are just fine\\". Tools crafted for peak performance are in no way adequate for a standard performance.    In the case of \\"memory athletes\\", as the book calls them and as they call themselves, their sport does not even resemble a `peak' performance (racing) of something that we otherwise do naturally (driving). What they appear to be doing is `hacking' the process of something we are bad at (remembering repetitive information without context) by doing something we are good at instead (developing stable memories of colourful, moving, peculiar things) and then converting the results of the latter into what amounts to an incredible performance in the former.    A casual marathon runner who wants to become a professional might change the type of training he goes through, his running technique, the shoes he uses and his diet, but in the end his performance is just the same as before - running - only better. His performance is enhanced by focusing and streamlining all the factors that contribute to speed and endurance, but he is still just running. A mental athlete in no way can be said to perform the same tasks that we normally call memorising, and his skill - as evidenced in the book - do not translate into improved performance in any other type of mental task. In the same way in which repeatedly taking IQ tests improves one's performance on IQ tests only, memory athletes seem to be proficient only in their specialised fields of memorisation, becoming again humans like us when they are given information to remember in unforeseen formats.    To be fair, the author seem to be aware at almost all times ofthe gimmicky nature of the discipline, doubting whether memory athletes are really `memorising' things or whether they are just geeks with a very peculiar hobby. And at the end of the book, when a fellow memory athlete asks him if he intends to continue competing, he more or less replies that he's got better stuff to do.    For all the interesting research and discussion about memory in this book, the author does not address what is the real, fundamental problem with mnemonic techniques, which is that they overestimate the importance of remembering raw information and forget the importance of finding it at the right time. Unless you are a minstrel or you live in a 9th Century monastery, remembering strings of information is not really that important. What counts is remembering what you need to remember at the right time, and knowing how it is positioned relative to other, related information.  Every time one learns a new piece of information he also creates a set of conditions for that information to be retrieved (how long will it be remembered for consciously? And unconsciously? What clues will cause that piece of information to be retrieved? What other information will come to mind once that first memory has been accessed? What state of mind creates the best chances for recollection?), and every time the information is recalled these conditions change. Nobody (besides card-counters at the blackjack table) needs to remember that Einstein moonwalking is the eight of diamonds, but quite a few people have a constant need - for instance - to make the right connection at the right time during a discussion. In other words, what ultimately matters is building the right index for information to be woven onto.    About three months ago I started the daunting task of learning the apparently endless series of Chinese characters, and within the first few days I had already come across online several techniques which promised to speed up the process by orders of magnitude by using various mnemonics to perform the task. I took a half afternoon and without too much effort studied 100 characters using techniques similar to those described in this book. The next day I realised that I could still remember clearly those characters, but they seemed to be nested inside a useless labyrinth of curious and confusing images. More problematically, characters learnt by `rote' were hard to learn but could be easily recognised instinctively and pronounced timely when appearing in a sentences, while the meaning and pronounciation of characters learnt through mnemonics had to be `determined' consciously. When they were recognised the recognition process required a deviation to the `labyrinth' in which I had placed them the day before. They had become trapped in a web of useless imagery, which more or less only allowed me only to recite them in order and out of context. In the end, I had to forget them and re-learn them all. Rote learning is hard, but puts the information in the right closet, mnemonic techniques allows to memorise a lot, but store memories in a jungle of oneiric images without context.    Perhaps the only true memory champion of the book is \\"S\\" the journalist, whose inarrestable synesthetic river of memories tightly woven onto sensorial perceptions made him a `natural' surrounded by `fakes'. His experience is perhaps the only one in this book to have shed some light on how memory works, while it fails us so often and why sometimes it seems to work as it should.  After dropping mnemonic techniques, in order to continue learning Chinese I dedicated myself to flashcards and I started creating taxonomic indexes of characters based on their components. At a certain point in the process of memorisation I realised that every new character that I consciously learnt by means of `rote' (aided by decomposition into elements, and the study of its etymology) became encoded in my mind as a specific, vague and almost imperceptible synesthetic image whichserved as an address bar to instantly track back the meaning and pronounciation of the character. In this new synesthetic code, created - so to say - without intention but with a lot of effort, informaton of pronounciation, meaning and tone are embedded as properties of this image.  Operating under the assumption that I have no savant skills and that I'm gifted with a normal dose of memory and intelligence, I can only imagine that this is how we always encode our memories, especially when we work hard at it. \\"S\\" was simply able to do naturally and all the time what you and I can only do with a lot of effort and by marshalling all our attention and concentration.
B00004YRQA|4.0|The PS2 memory card isn't bad, it as stated before lacks the ability to save PS1 titles and vice versa but that is ok i guess. i've never had any problems with these memory cards myself(and i own and have used alot of these cards).    The PS1 cards however, i've had some corruptions for no aparent reason(i don't pull the memory cards out while the system is on or anything). Glad it was fixed in the newer cards though.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|To the people who have been giving the Kindle edition of this bundle 1-star reviews because the Kindle edition was more expensive than the paperback edition:    PRICES CHANGE! As I write this, the Kindle edition is a few cents cheaper than the paperback collection, not twice as much, as it was when you wrote your 1-star reviews.    Also, when you give it a 1-star review, THAT APPLIES TO THE PRINT EDITION, TOO! So you think you're bringing down the rating for only the Kindle edition, but you're also bringing down the rating for the paperback edition of the bundle.    Lesson? Don't rate based on price. Complain about the price in your review, fine, but the star rating should be for the book itself, not a fluctuating thing like price.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|Richard Kelly is one of the most underrated film makers working today.  And The Box is arguably his finest work.  I didn't see this film when it was in theaters, but when I finally saw it on DVD, I watched it twice in one evening.  To anyone who didn't quite get it and thought it was a waste of time, I would suggest watching it again.  What initially seems like random odd tidbits with no purpose, are actually very essential to the story.  A second viewing reveals just how expertly constructed this film really is.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys actually using their brain from time to time.
B004HO6HWK|4.0|I was hoping for more on the supplement angle and picture quality for being a Sony title (and part of a known franchise now) but this will have to do.<br /><br />The story follows an elite mechanic/hitman as he weaves through deception and retribution while mentoring the son (played excellently by Foster) of his former friend and boss (Sutherland). Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since [[ASIN:B000ALM40I 11:14]]; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.<br /><br />The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par. The DTS is as expected from Sony and it rocks nicely with the various explosions and gunfights. I was disappointed with the lack of extras, but they include:<br /><br />* movieIQ. The standard IMDB-on-your-screen-while-watching. The best trivia was in the making-of.<br />* Alternate opening, deleted scenes, 10:46 minutes. The alternate opening made no sense but the deleted scenes definitely removed some character development for the Sutherland/Statham friendship. The long scene of Foster/Statham at his truck towards the beginning has nothing different except that they had to muddy the rear-view mirror (in the film) because it showed the entire crew accidentally.<br />* Making of, 7:47 minutes. Too short, but still had some decent background on filming, including Foster's injury which then makes sense (what I thought before seeing this was a significant writing error) as to why they filmed Foster having to kill left-handed; especially since he says he is not a lefty in the film. Good stunt info also.<br /><br />Region coded A, English and Spanish subs only. Try not to compare this to the original, or against other Statham action pieces, and you might get some decent entertainment out of it. 3.5 for the film and sound, .5 for the supplements.supplements.
B00000JMOF|4.0|One of the first and, arguably, the finest of the sound Expressionist classics, FRANKENSTEIN owes as much to its star as to its director: Boris Karloff evokes pathos as the put-upon patchwork pariah, and even Jack Peirce's fantastic, horrifying makeup can't hide the heart that beats within the breast of this undying monster. Colin Clive is likewise great as the driven man whose mad dream becomes a lumbering nightmare. Mention must also be made of Dwight Frye as the childishly cruel Fritz. Horror is, indeed, Universal. Mary Shelley would've been proud.

B002VKE1K2|2.0|Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) have been living together for three years and out of the blue, they are haunted by an entity while they are sleeping. Katie discloses to Micah that she has been haunted since she was eight year-old and the skeptical Micah buys a camera to videotape the paranormal activity in their home during the night. Katie calls the psychic Fredrichs (Marc Fredrichs) to help them, and he explains that he is specialist in ghosts; however he feels the presence of a fiend and advises the couple to call a friend of him and do not try to contact the demon. However, Micah borrows an Ouija board endangering their lives.    After the original \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", many low-budget movies made with hand-held camera have been released and the only exception that really worked is the Spanish \\"(REC)\\". \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is ridiculously overrated and I cannot understand the hype around this flick. The acting is reasonable, but the screenplay is ridiculous, with Micah filming their daily routine even in the most bizarre and unusual moments. I cannot understand how a viewer can startle or fear with the awful scenes and noises, unless those that are easily influenced by the marketing of smart producers that releases a cheap crap wrapped in advertisements and fake reviews promoting the movie
0061537969|4.0|Heartwarming, quite charming and a little sad, the book puts a perspective on how dogs view human beings, and the ways in which they are helping and watching over their owners in life, and even after death.  A very good read!

0670022411|5.0|This book is extremely well written.  The author is articulate and entertaining, and slowly guides you through a magical world of witches, vampires, and daemons.  The romance between Diana and Matthew is a slow love building in  intensity and increasing the reader's anticipation throughout the whole book.  I can't wait for book 2, and I hope they make movies using the series!
B003UESJHO|5.0|I have to say Christian Bale was absolutely flawless in his portrayal of such a complex character, Dickie. While I found Mark Wahlberg's Mickey to be pretty one dimensional, Bale executed an emotional performance of a character who encompassed every adjective in the book: funny, quirky, crazy, selfish, pathetic, delusional,endearing,loyal etc. I also thought Amy Adams was wonderful in a role that showcased her range as an actress.    As a Massachusetts native, I enjoyed seeing the Lowell setting and I was oh so grateful that there were no God-awful, overexaggerated accents (I'm talking to you Diane Lane). Although the \\"underdog comes up big\\" story is one we've seen before, this is truly a well acted, entertaining movie.
B004RE29WW|4.0|I'm one of the few that actually enjoys Alien 3. It's not a perfect film by any means, but being a huge fan of the series, I will definitely say that it is pretty underrated. One of the things that annoys me, and the thing that is probably the films biggest flaw is that mysterious egg at the beginning.     Other than that, it's a solid sequel from first time director David Fincher. The film does get pretty slow near the end but if you've seen the documentary done for the film, you already know it went through development hell, so those certain things are easier to overlook.     As far as PQ for the Blu-ray, it's fantastic. The film has never looked better, and probably never will. There are some shots though that look a bit smudgy or less detailed but I would say 90% of it is very well detailed.    Oh, and be sure to watch the Assembly Cut of Alien 3 if you haven't already. It's my preferred cut and is much more closer to Fincher's original vision.
B004QIG7CW|4.0|What I Can Tell You: This is exactly the direction Disney should be going right now. I love the friendship, be strong, be proud, stand up for what you believe in theme.<br /><br />The movie starts out with Stella, a new girl who is angry about moving and starting a new school a month into the semester.  She finds herself in detention where she meets four other freshman students. They seem to have nothing in common until, they start putting together a beat, each one bringing something different to the sound. Before you know it, they are a band.<br /><br />With the help of a Lemonade Machine, a spirited music teacher played by Trisha Campbell Martin, and Stella with a penchant for being heard, the group play in front of their peers and are actually really good.<br /><br />I loved the building of the friendships between the kids and how their problems seemed very real and not contrived. There is someone everyone can relate to; whether you are the ignored kid, the quiet kid, the overachiever, you will find someone who resonates with you.<br /><br />Another surprised was that the songs were actually good! I didn't feel silly watching this and kids will undoubtedly appreciate the music. Catchy without the over saccharin of most kid friendly musicals.<br /><br />Great movie!
B004856SQ8|4.0|Overall very fun movie to watch enjoy all of the characters definitely more of a comedic action movie not an intense thriller by any means.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This amzing book takes a crime story, one that has been told often in hundreds of books, but tells it from an entirely new perspective: a 5 year old boy.   i thought the writing clever and thoughtul. for those of you have raised children or work with children during the pre-school years, you understand how quickly language can develop as well as how quickly children learn. As Ms. Donoghue lay's out this tale from Jack's voice she manages to subtly include the processes of child development. in the roughly 4 to 6 weeks that take place in this book, Jack learns new words, new sensations, new feelings.  and we are right there with him each step of the way. what is ever present during this reading however is that Jack is a victim of a horrendous crime, but we are forced to understad it from his perspective. This is creative writing at its finest!
B000E1MXUK|5.0|His character has a little mystery to him.  A little nice, a little dangerous, and the romance part works even without any sex scenes.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I was hoping for more - more funny, more insightful thoughts but just found this memoir ok.  The writing was - structure and prose - was fine.  It seemed like a very superficial story and perhaps her story really isn't more interesting and dramatic than what's written.  I just didn't feel that I got to know her any better than when I started (she's low key, loves her family and appreciates her life).  I probably wouldn't purchase another Tina Fey authored book but I don't respect her any less.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The 7th Harry Potter book marks a distinct shift in the series, as Dumbledore is dead, Harry and friends are no longer at Hogwarts, and the world is facing a dark future that only they can prevent. This film captures those shifts beautifully. Harry, Ron and Hermione are grown, and feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders. This is a somber film, so different from the first few, but very powerful. The director used the landscape beautifully in this film to convey the stark, dark feeling of this phase of their quest, and the impact of wearing the 2nd Horcrux. From dreary woods to desolate cliffs and beachsides, the settings are gorgeous, empty, and spooky. The three leads put in their best and subtlest performances to date - no more mugging for the camera. They convey both their deep affections and inner turmoils brilliantly. Dream sequences are gorgeous, and the animated telling of the story of the 3 brothers (the genesis of the deathly hallows of the title) is brilliant. I also loved the scene where Hermione and Harry briefly take off the Horcrux and dance - just a moment of joy before they reshoulder their burden.<br /><br />My only warning would be that this film will make no sense to someone not familiar with the books or other movies. While some of the past movies have been OK as standalones, this one requires prior knowledge of the story, and very little is offered as explanation for those that don't already know. I'm fine with that - this is the 7th film after all.<br /><br />Anyway, a wonderful setup for the final film!

B004HO6I4M|4.0|This is a vibrant, fun family film. The Rio setting - both the surrounding jungles and the city during Carnivale - are gorgeous to look at, with bright colors and movement. The Latin music adds an upbeat, festive feel throughout. The performances are all solid, and some adult hidden humor is thrown in to keep it from getting too dull for parents. The story is predictable however, and that is the only thing that keeps it from being 5-star. That didn't bother my kids in the least - ages 4 and 6 - but kept it from being a slam-dunk for me, by a hair. In spite of that though, if you have young children, this is a great film to see.
014241722X|1.0|This book was the least exciting thing I have picked up in ages.  The story like is so weak and has no hook or suspense to it at all. It takes a lot to hold the attention of our youth these days and this story isn't even close.  I expect more from Grisham.

B004GGM444|5.0|Holy S**t, where do I start? This CD is amazing. The production is top notch. BT is the gold standard as far as his CD's go when it comes to production but on this CD Skrillex really knocks it out of the park. What I love about BT is he never wastes a note or sound effect. Every sample, every instrument is there for a reason. Well, I get the same feeling on this Skrillex CD. Skrillex is now a new favorite.    This CD hits hard and the BASS sounds fantastic. The quality of the recording is flawless. Skrillex is in a league of his own.
B000784WMW|5.0|I saw this when it first aired on PBS many years ago and thought it was the best adaptation of the book I'd ever seen. There is so much more story that can be covered in a mini-series than there is in a production that is geared toward theatrical release.     Zelah Clarke is the definitive Jane, in my opinion. She encompasses the range of depth needed for this complex character. The has the full range: humility, humor, passion and steadiness of character.  Timothy Dalton is, perhaps, too handsome for Mr. Rochester but is understated and presents a fully formed character. His performance is brooding, menacing,  repressed and full of passion. I was quite surprised by an actor that seems to be rather one dimensional in other roles. Together they have a palpable and understated chemistry. Andrew Bicknell as St. John Rivers is classically handsome, as he should be.     There are some technical issues as the lighting and sound are poorly done in some scenes. However, it is a TV production that is nearly 30 years old so I will not quibble.  My high def TV is not kind to the production aspects.      So, if you love the book as I do, skip the current theatrical release which is less than satisfying. Curl up on a chilly, rainy Sunday and immerse yourself in Bronte's timelessly beautiful story. You won't be disappointed.
B003L77GG0|5.0|MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The tenth season of \\"Smallville\\" is a tremendous ride to a stirring final episode.  It is a great sendoff overall for what is arguably the finest television series of its entire genre.<br /><br />Beginning with \\"Lazarus,\\" the season propels Clark on a fantastic journey. Pulled back from death in the season premiere by Lois Lane, the love of his life, Clark must face a freakishly cloned Lex Luthor, played extremely well in the premiere by Mackenzie Gray.  Additionally, Clark must contend with the knowledge that an evil supernatural being known as Darkseid threatens to dominate the Earth.  John Schneider also returns in the first episode as Johnathan Kent, Clark's departed Earthly father, now a spirit guide for him.<br /><br />The season's second episode \\"Shield,\\" is an important show for the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller's corrupt fighting force.  The group of radically violent superhero supporters comes to the forefront as the primary villains in the early half of the season.  The show also introduces the \\"Smallville\\" iteration of Cat Grant, a latter-day \\"Superman\\" character whom I first became familiar with through \\"Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman.\\"  Played by actress Keri Lynn Pratt, she is fairly annoying but essentially has good intentions.<br /><br />This season also features the series' landmark 200th episode, an absolute gem called \\"Homecoming.\\"  The return of James Marsters as Brainiac 5 heralds a stunning trip through time for Clark.  An important component of emotional peace and closure regarding Johnathan's death finally gives Clark a mature philosophical base for true love with Lois Lane.  Unfortunately, the very next episode \\"Isis\\" is one of the few true low points of the season, a head-scratching show whose storyline is random and pointless.  It mostly exists to drag a fringe superhero into the show but does have a moment of redemption at its conclusion.<br /><br />When \\"Smallville\\" premiered in 2001, itspremise and promise was the journey of the hero Clark Kent and the future villain Lex Luthor.  As with any long-running TV series, cast members gradually left \\"Smallville,\\" even including the show's original mature Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum.  To the immense credit of the series' creative staff, the overall story arc was wisely altered slightly, to both keep the name Lex Luthor viable in the series and make room for a charismatic female antihero named Tess Mercer.  Cassidy Freeman contributes depth and ultimately compassion as a multifaceted actress, and has a very rich character arc in the final season.  Lex Luthor is kept viable this season through a series of clones, ironically at first nurtured in secret by Tess.  I can forgive an absurd contrivance to bring the deceased Lionel Luthor back to life in the episode \\"Luthor.\\"  The show is one of the best of the season, and John Glover's devilishly cold acting approach to Lionel Luthor is, technically speaking, the work of a master.<br /><br />Episode highlights are \\"Homecoming,\\" \\"Ambush,\\" \\"Abandoned,\\" \\"Icarus,\\" \\"Shield,\\" \\"Patriot,\\" \\"Lazarus,\\" and the series finale, a two-hour masterpiece entitled simply \\"Finale.\\"<br /><br />The finale is a thoughtful romp through ten years of series backstory, thematically exploring the character of Clark Kent in its first half and revealing the character of Superman in its second half.  The Darkseid storyline comes to a gruesome head and original series stars Tom Welling and Michael Rosenbaum fulfill the series' intial promise.  A brilliant storytelling balance highlighting the marriage of Clark and Lois and the full emergence of Superman juxtaposed against a monstrous dark turn for both Lionel and Lex sets the perfect tone for the series' conclusion.<br /><br />I love \\"Smallville.\\"  Over its time on the air, it has become one of my favorite television shows of all time.  Thank you to the cast and crew through all ten years, and to original series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.  This is a truly brilliant show.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I never identified with teen soap operas even when I was a teenager, as they invariably follow wealthy popular kids in an upscale fantasy high school in a glamorous destination city.  Earlier attempts to flip this dynamic on its head by showing how the rest of us lived, such as with [[ASIN:B00151QYT4 Square Pegs]] and [[ASIN:B0001EQHXO Freaks and Geeks]], had failed because the outcasts were already living it and the in-crowd just didn't care.  This, however, accomplishes that goal by playing it all as satirical comedy: a cash-strapped public school in an unglamorous Midwestern Flyover town where everybody subconsciously knows they're a loser and are self-medicating against that by whatever means necessary, and even the people who managed to escape still come back in disgrace.  Former golden boy turned Spanish teacher Will Schuester is still at the high school he once attended, getting it from both ends from his high school sweetheart turned self-centered, Pottery Barn-addicted shrew wife Terri and the machinations of trying-really-hard-to-be-a-celebrity-through-ultra-overachievement cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester who views any reduction of either her overinflated budget or attention directed her way to be a 9/11-class personal attack.  He takes over the glee club just to feel something, and in turn starts giving a variety of kids at the school something to take pride in, from diva-in-training Rachel and bully-bait Kurt to queen-bee cheerleader Quinn and quarterback of the worst football team ever Finn.  The song-and-dance numbers you can take or leave, because they're not the main course of the show.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|This film embraces near-death experiences and the notion of a Non-Judgment Day as fact.<br /><br />Obviously, an aging Clint Eastwood, sitting atop the world amidst his fame, accolades and wealth is beginning to grapple with what may come, if anything, after his own demise, when it uncertain he will fare as well as he has in his present life. Through this film Eastwood attempts to move the viewer toward accepting the view that \\"all\\" (asserted by C&eacute;cile De France's character); all of us, no matter what we have done, end up in a light-infused netherworld where we float lighter than air (but of course there is no \\"air\\" there, strictly speaking).<br /><br />I have no control over what Eastwood believes about an afterlife, and as a Christian I would not want to control it, but outrageously, Eastwood throws Christianity under the bus to create conflict in this film; for where there is no conflict, there is no story, no story - no profit, no Academy Awards.<br /><br />C&eacute;cile De France's character (a French journalist/media star) has a near death experience; it transforms her life and the conflict arises when her desire to publish, in book form, her experience is opposed by reactionary forces including the \\"religious lobby\\". Now if you are so naive as to believe that in America, let alone France, there exists a \\"religious lobby\\" that could pressure a publishing house to not publish someone's views on an afterlife, then I suggest you go grow up. Simply go to the Amazon.com advanced search engine and type in \\"near death\\" for \\"All Categories\\", and you'll find that the \\"religious lobby\\" has not been very successful from stopping anybody from publishing anything they like about life, or absence of life, after death.<br /><br />Apparently what Eastwood is trying to convey is the likely truth that people who try to convince others about an afterlife, or what it is like, based on alleged near death experiences may meet with skepticism from many people, including from \\"religious\\" people, including Christians, like me. So apparently, if I as a Christian tend to dismiss the significance of near death experiences, than I am bigoted and closed-minded (so much for freedom of religion). I could point out  there where many reliable witnesses to Christ's resurrection, but I don't go around bashing persons who remain skeptical.<br /><br />The other big problem I have with this film is that lack of depth brought to the suggestion of everyone, without exception, enjoying this blissful afterlife. In this film a child molester is depicted as doing just fine in his afterlife, although he begs forgiveness from his still-living daughter for molesting her. Did any Hollywood deep-thinker ever consider the contradiction between the notions of sending a child molester, whether repentant or not, to this delightful light-infused netherworld, but this same person IS seeking forgiveness from his daughter? Which is it? Do people need forgiveness or not? If we \\"all\\" go to a pleasant netherworld, why seek forgiveness? We can rub shoulders with Mother Theresa and Pol Pot in a great big happy clam bake; no judgment, just happy times., like me.

0385474547|4.0|I think that this books interesting. It deals with the themes of cultural clashes and leadership. The writing was a little different because it follows the ways of the Ibo, there are lots of proverbs. Somethings that I didn't like were that the culture was very severe. Women were looked down upon but not the Oracle, they couldn't tap palm tree for the oil unless it was on the ground (the higher class of men) and the women were beaten and totally taken advantage of in my opinion. It was just a society full of contradictions. The ending was understandable. I have to admit that at first I was disappointed, however, after thinking about it for a little while I decided that the ending made sense and I don't think that another ending would have worked well in the end.    This was definitely an interesting book.

140120841X|5.0|This was definitely interesting. The movie, V For Vendetta is based on this graphic novel and the art in this was interesting, especially the special article that was posting in the end of the book about the interview that Alan Moore did when the story was still in progress. Those pictures are amazing. If you have seen the movie and liked it I would definitely recommend that you read it because in the book, you find out a little more about V and his background as well as about Evey. I love the plot of this.    Some favorite lines that I could find:        page 14 - \\"Remember, remember the fifth of November, the gun-powder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gun-powder treason... Should ever be forgot\\"      page 41 - \\"Her name is ANARCHY and she has taught me more as a mistress than you EVER did! SHE has taught me that Justice is meaningless without freedom. She is HONEST . She makes no promises and breaks none. Unlike YOU, Jezebel.\\"      page 177 - \\"To pick a flower is not a large thing.

It, like every series has some episodes better or worse than others, but the series is asically fun and shows his time before his suit of red and blue and how he becomes the man he is to be that person we all know, it shows his trials, loves, challanges, and we can all relate to that.  But the end was killer! I am looking forward to a Justice League because it it set up for that and looking forward to Avengers coming up.

031261246X|4.0|I am a crime analyst who has worked in law enforcement for over twenty years. I also blog on crime analysis and law enforcement at a blog called The Crime Analyst's Blog. I don't usually do book reviews on The Crime Analyst's Blog. However, when the author's publicist contacted me about this and sent me some info on the book it piqued my interest. Zero Day is a novel by Mark Russinovich. Part of what interested me in this book was Mark's background. Mark is a cyber-security expert and is a Technical Fellow at Microsoft among other things. It's probably be safe to say that he's a serious computer geek/guru. The other part that interested me was the premise of the book, a terrorist related large scale cyber attack.     A few weeks ago at my workplace the organizations mail server took a dive. I don't consider my organization to overly dependent on email but the effects of a couple of days without email was quite pronounced. I was surprised how inconvenient things got during this outage. The scenario is Zero Day takes computer outage to new levels. Not to give away too much but the scenario is especially prescient since the recent death of Osama bin Laden and the threats of retaliation by Al Qaeda sympathizers.     The book was an easy, enjoyable read. The chapters were short, something I like since most of my reading is usually done is short bursts. For me, I'd rather stop at the end of chapter rather than in the midst of a long chapter. The story line was engaging, and a lot like other thrillers such as a Tom Clancy book. Right around the middle of the book there was a unexpected plot twist that made the book hard to put down. For entertainment alone, it made the book worth the read.     As a crime analyst, stories like Zero Day get me to thinking about the implications should a scenario like this leave the realm of fiction and make it's way to the real world. Some crime fiction stories are so outlandish as to have nearly no chance of becoming real. However, the scenario in Zero Day is entirely plausible. Of course that's part of the reason it's so thrilling. It's also the reason that a story like this this keeps analysts awake at night.     Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a review copy of the book mentioned above for free in the hope that I would review it on my blog. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: \\"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\\"
0393338827|4.0|I like Michael Lewis's writing style, and he does a great job of giving the feeling of the players who saw the financial meltdown coming. I would have given the book 5 stars except for the fact that Lewis included a little too much jargon for me to feel like I understood exactly what was going on. Part of this may be because no one really knew what was going on. But I think there may have been a way to fill in the gaps. I think an author such as John Krakauer did that fill-in job very well regarding Mormonism in [[ASIN:1400032806 Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith]]. It adds more pages to a book, but that additional context, to the extent that Lewis could have provided it, would have left me feeling as if I learned more from the book. But it is definitely worth reading if you want to know more about the financial players on the other side of the crisis.
B004ZT9QVQ|4.0|NO SPOILERS!!!    This was a good standalone story that showed off the acting chops of Hugh Bonneville.  Folks have been talking about budget cuts at the BBC, but there is nothing in evidence in this detailed production; mostly taking place on a 16th century priate ship.      The characters were somewhat complex.  It was nice to see the plot layers slowly peel away like an onion.  Cheers to Steve Thompson who keeps the tension high while throwing in the fun.    Ignore the complaints from people who are upset that it is a stand alone episode.  A story is a story, and this was a good yarn.
B002ZG980U|4.0|[This is a review for the single disc DVD, which had no features, no scene selection and nothing but language changing and some trailers.  Get the dual disc edition.]<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />Christopher Nolan put together a very imaginative piece, about the development of a fictitious science that can delve into other people's minds and extract information for government or corporate use - trade secrets and the like.  The story does fall down though in not always making clear to the audience what's going on.  The actors at times mumble their words and the \\"moody\\" lighting becomes dull and hard to see (although that might just be my TV set).<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, the mastermind who is an expert at going into others dreams and finding secrets.  Sometimes he can go dreams within dreams.  Unfortunately the clients whose dreams he attempts to invade also have their own constructs and sometimes military force of the subconscious to take care of Cobb and his ilk.<br /><br />Cobb also has a major guilt complex going on.  His wife and he also explored their own inner mind except she thought the \\"real\\" world was in fact another dream layer and promptly killed herself.  She also created a scenario where he would be on the run from the law for her death -- wow, tough love!<br /><br />All these come together when Cobb is hired out by Saito, a corporate energy dealer who wants to plant an idea (an \\"inception\\") for Robert Fisher Jr. (Cillian Murphy) to make his own energy business, break it up and thus Saito could then deal with this competitor rather than be relegated to second rate power.<br /><br />To help Cobb ostensibly deal with the architect of the dreams he hires smart girl Ariadne (Ellen Page).  Though she plays her part fairly well, the character is not developed very much.  She does a lot of yelling at the guy, finds out a few of his secrets and rubs his face in his bad decision-making while on the mission (which tends to bend to his guilt), but she's not developed much.  Not a lot of romance or adventure with this character!<br /><br />The others of the team are similarly not well-developed.  After we get to somewhat know them, they're really throwaway characters -- vital to the plot but we don't really invest a lot of emotion into caring if they live or not.<br /><br />Effects:<br /><br />I must say the special effects were amazing.  The attention to detail, every drop of water, every piece of shattered glass, perfectly poised as in real life.  The \\"zero gravity\\" scene (my word for it) was amazing.  Did they have an actual room they were rotating or what was CGI?<br /><br />Not a lot of fight scenes in the film, although there were plenty of chase scenes in the streets and on the slopes.  The audience is shunted from scene to scene rather quickly, at times too much so.  I found myself rewinding the DVD to see what I just missed.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Imaginative story, excellent fictitious science of the mind, where even with high technology we still have guilt, misunderstandings and in some cases some pretty blatant attempts at making others wrong to fill a book!  The special effects were great, but the editing was such as to at times confuse and startle.  The dialogue could have been clearer with a few less English accents (though Michael Caine, in the small part he played, was marvelous).<br /><br />Recommended, but you may have to have your finger on the rewind to fully follow what's going on.  The ending was fun, left a question in your mind.<br /><br />Directed by<br />Christopher Nolan<br /><br />Writing credits<br />Christopher Nolan  (written by)<br /><br />Cast (in credits order<br /><br /> Leonardo DiCaprio ...

He always writes and excellent song and never dissapoints with a vintage sound that more to less breaks clear of Dire Straits with songs like \\"Hill Farmers Blues\\" and a quirky but still good \\"Quality Shoe\\". I would recommend this to anyone looking to get into Knopfler or Dire straits for that matter.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Brian De Palma is my favorite director because he is one of the rare filmmakers still making films like they are supposed to be made, and not like these god awful bad CGI infested video game looking pieces of garbage coming out lately. Seriously, what the hell is happening to cinema today???! It is very rare that a movie actually looks like a film anymore! It's amazing how a movie made in 1976 can look just as great, if not better, today than it did when it came out, and that is the case with \\"Carrie\\".<br /><br />Right on the heels of \\"Obsession\\" (1975), De Palma directed the film adaptation of Stephen King's first novel, \\"Carrie\\" (1976), the story of the girl with telekinetic powers who is the underdog in her high school, and has a very horrific date to the prom that goes horribly awry. Produced by Paul Monash and scripted by Lawrence D. Cohen. Working on a very modest (meaning low) budget, De Palma created a satiric scary masterpiece! Yes, \\"satiric\\", because it is really a satire with lots of dark humor permeating throughout it.<br /><br />Well, to begin with, it's neat, knowing how De Palma works, loving to tell stories in complicated ways, using flashbacks, weaving back and forth, and nonlinear fashion, that he would choose to use a very straight forward approach with this film, when the source novel itself was written in a back and forth, nonlinear fashion, with lots of flashbacks.<br /><br />The film opens with an awesome crane tracking shot showing high school girls outside playing volleyball, and the camera slowly moving in on one particular girl.<br />Starring Sissy Spacek (in an Oscar nominated role), Piper Laurie (who De Palma got to come out of retirement for this role, and she was nominated for an Oscar, too, for her performance in this), Nancy Allen (who would go on to star in 3 other De Palma films, \\"Home Movies\\", \\"Dressed To Kill\\", and \\"Blow Out\\", and then onto a few B-rate films, like the \\"Robocop\\" films, and \\"Strange Invaders\\"), John Travolta (in his first film), Amy Irving (De Palma's \\"The Fury\\", \\"Traffic\\"), P.J. Soles (\\"Halloween\\", \\"Rock -N- Roll High School\\"), Edie McClurg (\\"Planes, Trains, & Automobiles), William Katt (\\"House\\", TV's \\"Greatest American Hero\\"), Priscilla Pointer (Amy Irving's real-life mom) and Betty Buckley, the cast reads like a \\"Who's-who\\" of now established Hollywood big name stars, most of which made their debuts in this film.<br /><br />De Palma's pacing during the long drawn out prom set piece is awesome! The way he puts Tommy and Carrie in a spinning cycle dancing to symbolize the exuberation of how Carrie is feeling will leave you breathless (with an awesome score by Pino Donnaggio throughout the entire film), and his use of split screen during Carrie's revenge sequence is utterly amazing! The prom sequence has gone down in movie history as one of the greatest scenes ever in horror film and/or drama (and/or satire), for this film is all three genres. And this film contains scenes that rival anything ever done in horror!!<br /><br />But in my opinion, the best part of the film is the scene at the end of the film in which Sue Snell wakes up from a nightmare all frantic and screaming, with her mom consoling her, and Sue is continuously screaming as the camera starts backing away, up toward the ceiling, as mother tries to console daughter, in another great crane tracking shot, completely reversing itself from the opening shot at the beginning of the film,  the backward crane shot mirroring the opening crane shot.<br />One of the (if not the) best psychological, telekinetic, sinister, horrifying, satiric tragedies ever filmed.<br />HIGHLY recommended!

B0001FR3IQ|1.0|I just watched this movie again after not seeing it since I bought it used a few years ago. Talk about a fkg mess! I was cringing through this, and for all the wrong reasons, LOL. And after about an hour into it, I lost count of how many times it started over using deux es machina, throwing everything but the kitchen sink at the screen hoping something would stick, and nothing does! Wow, what a waste of film, and a waste of my time!<br /><br />Director Mathieu Kassovitz does an amiable job of creating atmosphere early on, but it is quickly all wasted by an atrocious screenplay by Sebastian Gutierrez. Plus, I wasn't that impressed with Halle Berry's \\"generic\\" acting either. Yes, she's good, but not as great as a lot of people want to let on. On the other hand, poor Penelope Cruz, who is a great actress, is completely wasted here! I kept saying to myself that it would be a better film if it were more about her, but to my heavy disappointment, she is only in a few little scenes; matter of fact, you can count them on one hand. What a shame! And while I've never been a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr., he does some good acting in some things, and even does a good job here, but it is all in vain, for his talents are also wasted here as well; as are the talents of John Carroll Lynch, and practically everybody else that is in this.<br /><br />You know a movie is bad when at the one hour mark, the lead character screams out at the ghost, \\"What do you want from me?!\\", and you start laughing and thinking \\"I just want this movie to END!\\" The word \\"convoluted\\" doesn't even begin to describe this film! It might have been better if they had stuck to either making a straight-forward ghost story, or a straight-forward psychological mystery thriller, but this film tries (too hard) to make all of the above, and fails miserably. It started out as a three, to four, star movie, but I quickly started reducing stars as it went along, and by the end it was barely even worth rating one star.<br />I recommend skipping this one! Thank you! :>)ping this one! Thank you! :>)
0307455874|2.0|Very disappointing read, nothing special, it has a tone of arrogance that I could not get over. I could not finish.
B0045HCJG2|1.0|Apparently there is some way to be paid for writing a review here on Amazon. How else could Cobra receive so many four and five star reviews? This movie is a POS. Period. End of story.
0385528752|5.0|In transformational stories, the \\"Before and after\\" images are generally what we are fed from the media. Rarely is it shown how the idea came to be accomplished. Prior to reading this book, I thought one had to have an endless amount of enthusiasm in order to get big things done. This book shows examples of fixes to overwhelming problems and the analysis of how it was done, step by step. To me this is the real value of this book. This step by step analysis has never been put together in this manner before. The authors collected the data from studies and real life people reaching their goals.     It is a book for those interested in sociology, for those involved in non-profits, those attempting to motivate for a cause, even for the small business owner who wants more productive employees. It shows that what appears to be apathy may simply be the result of lack of information.      What it will not do: Give you a specific outline to your specific problem. You will need to do some serious analysis of your situation. You will need to do your research. You will need to be creative. Think of it this way - the book is a blue print. You'll need to get all the tools, the materials and the labor. You will also need a few people willing to interpret the blue print. This is only outline, but what an outline.     If there is a formula to change, this is it. And frankly, I find that exciting.
B004P12SSW|5.0|It's truly hard to take a story line that has been done thousands of times from all all angles, but this movie did it.  The fact is that not since Chicago, a broadway smash success prior to its movie run, have I been so entertained by a movie musical!  Both Cher and Christina Aguilera were simply amazing.  The story itself is a replay, and without the outstanding singing, would have been an average film, but this, film wasn't just about being a film.  it is a musical in the traditional sense of the word, and the best musical that I have seen since, 2003, when I saw Chicago.  Eric Dane and Stanley Tucci, were good, but unfortunately, played roles so similar their previous work in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", that I feel that both were type cast, based on their outstanding performances in that Movie.  I am so used to seeing Cam Gigandet playing the bad guy, I wasn't sure that he was going to be able to pull off the \\"Good Guy\\", but he did and he did it extremely well.  Both Cher and Christina were amazing, just superb.  Why this movie was written off as mediocre, in my opinion, was based on trying to fit this movie into a dramatic category, rather than basing it on its merit as a musical.  Don't pass this up.  Watch it, or better yet just close your eyes and listen the the singing and enjoy!
0345495004|5.0|This book is a wonderful well written historical novel based on the love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamuh Cheney in the early 1900's.  I could not put it down! I read it in 2 days! I look forward to more books written by Nancy Horan![[ASIN:0345495004 Loving Frank: A Novel]]
B0041X90ZS|5.0|I own a lot of live albums and concert DVDs.  This one is really special.  I can remember only a few that had such an impact on me, and they're all from 20+ years ago.  To name some of them, \\"Exit... Stage Left\\" from Rush, \\"Plays Live\\" from Peter Gabriel, \\"Paris\\" from Supertramp and maybe, on a different note, \\"Alchemy\\" by Dire Straits.  In all cases, I was impressed to the point where I could not listen to something else, for a good while.    Shame on me, I did not know Transatlantic before they issued \\"The Whirlwind\\".  In fact, I bought it too late to see them live when they did the Whirld Tour.  But as soon as I listened to \\"The Whirlwind\\", I was caught.  Could not stop listening to it.  I could not believe that their two previous albums were as good...  I was wrong!  I ordered the 5 discs \\"Whirld Tour\\" and I was simply blown away, just like in the song!  This group is so good, I just could not believe my ears and my eyes!    So now I have also bought \\"Bridge Across Forever\\" and \\"SMPTe\\" and continue to discover this wonderful quartet (which is a quintet on Whirld Tour).  But I would say that, to me, the live album is even better than the original versions.    If you're into prog music, I highly recommend \\"Whirld Tour\\", either CD or DVD or both.  High value for the money, no question about it.  Let's hope that they come back, very soon!!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I could not put this book down. I thought it would be an easy pick up for my plane ride cross country but I ended up reading it during the trip whenever I had a spare moment. About 3/4 of the way through, I started to loose interest though. It seemed like it was mostly a set up for a second or series, but it dragged on. I loved the historical references and backstory. I will read the next book, but I'm still skeptical.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|Yes, this movie is just as weird as you remember. If you have not seen it, then rent before buying-it might not be for everyone. This is a cheesy 1980 film adaption of the classic TV show. It has aged well and the acting seems better each time I watch it. The story is based on the main premise of the show, or at least as much as I know about it. Queen's score is excellent and still fresh. This DVD contains the first episode of the original show, which is almost impossible to watch, but at the same time is awesome, along with a few other neat extras. There's also a couple of pieces of art in the box. My only problem, is that the box has a terrible opening mechanism. This is an awesome movie!
B00319ECGU|5.0|If you love the Dirty Harry series, this is a no brainer.  Amazon occasionally offers this set on sale, and even the regular price is good.  The 5 movies are in one compact box making it easy for storage.  The movies look good on Blu-ray, although not as crisp as more recent movies, or even other Blu-ray movies I have seen from the same time period.  I wish they would have spent more time improving the graininess and overall quality.  They still look better than the DVDs, however.  Recommended.
B00005JKNC|5.0|This is my favorite Jim Carrey movie, that I have ever seen, and I am a big fan of his comedy work. It is a very serious role for him and amazingly, he's completely believable. The story is that Jim Carrey's character in is a car crash, wakes up with amnesia, gets mistaken for a lost soldier, and starts living the life the soldier would live. That includes helping fix up the abandoned theater in town and generally lighting up the townspeople's lives. It's an excellent movie and it does, in fact need to be 3 hours long. It's absolutely worth your time, whether you're a fan of Jim Carrey or not!
B004K00NEO|4.0|Robots is not quite in the same league as the Pixar films, but it is well written and the animation is excellent.  The film looks fantastic in Blu-ray and is a feast for the eyes.  Definitely one of the better animated releases of the past 5 years.  Good for adults as well as kids.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I don't like violence in films very much, and I'm not a particular fan of boxing, so I wondered as I watched the closing credits, why I liked this movie so much.  None of the characters was heroic, in fact they were all deeply flawed, but neither were they evil antagonists.  The were simply intensely real and human.  The storyline was, of course, unique, but superbly believable, and it invoked parallels in the lives of most of us, no matter how different we superficially appear to be.  In the end, the stunning settings, the artful direction and the brilliant acting (from the top of the cast to the bottom) make this a film to respect.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|The first time I received this item, the slip-over case wasn't in the greatest shape, and Mari's face had some large scratches on it.  However, Amazon was quick to send me a replacement copy.  If you're a fan of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series, you will not regret watching Eva 1.11 and Eva 2.22.  The video quality is superb, and the audio is amazing.  My one, small complaint for this movie would have to be the part at the beginning, when some of the Japanese voice actors speak in English.  One line really stands out... You'll know which one I am talking about if you watch it. XD
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|What a fantastic book!  The characters were great!  And the universe the author has created is amazing.  I loved the writing style, the story, the romance, the humor, the action, everything.  I wish I could give it more than five stars.  Looks like I have a new favorite author. I'm so very glad!  Highly recommended!  Great job Ms. Harrison.  I've already pre-ordered the next book for my Kindle!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|What can I say.  4.7GHz overclock and the processor doesn't even get warm with all 4 cores and 8 threads loaded 100% (cooled by a Corsair H70).  I've been overclocking CPUs for a long time and this is, by far, the easiest CPU I've ever overclocked.  Excellent work Intel!
1439102813|5.0|'Still Alice' was an informative and interesting book, however the topic of memory loss is one most of us hesitate to discuss except to joke about it. Alice was a very endearing and beloved individual and yet you knew you would be sad at the way her life was changing. Let's face it, you don't want to think about it until you see a friend or a parent lose their thinking process. It's wasn't that Alice forgot where she put the the keys, but forgetting where she was on an early morning run revealed a sad and scary experience. Plenty of medical explanations accompanied parts of the story so it became easier to understand what was happening.     This used paperback book was in excellent shape and was shipped quickly from Amazon.
0060833459|5.0|OK - yes this is a book for managers. But that is NOT solely who Drucker is addressing as an \\"executive\\" in this book. He used \\"executive\\" as a general term for \\"knowledge worker\\" or for someone who is not working with concrete and repetitive tasks.     I recommend that anyone working in IT take a look at this book written 40+ years ago (originally published in 1966). He is describing methods to be effective in a working environment which is not tightly structured, which is not easily overseen, and in which many things can get away from you if you're not careful. It's about being effective working in Information Technology.
B0050SRZOQ|1.0|So for the last 10 seasons Clark Kent was a self-doubting and scared individual when it came to what role he was supposed to be and about his powers. Now all of a sudden Clark Kent does a 180 and is the superman. Even the last episode before the finale confirms this.    The producers left too many questions unanswered. I really hate it when TV shows follow this path; 10 Years of slow character progress then they hurry up and rush the ending. If I was able to rate this with zero stars I would.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|I want to be very clear for a second. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I love the aliens! I love Signorney Weaver in a blonde wig. I love Alan Rickman with a sculptured skull cap. I love Tim Allen for being an awesome, self-serving, but ultimately contientous commander. I love Tony Shaloub... well, I always love Tony Shaloub, but he played an AWESOME guy who was constantly high. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! How much do I love this movie??? Well, I was going through my movies and suddenly, I couldn't find my DVD. I'd had it forever, but for whatever reason, I absolutely and suddenly didn't have it. I tried to find it at my local WalMart and Targets, but no luck. So... What's a girl to do? I'll tell you what a girl does! She goes to Amazon.com and buys not only the DVD (which she immediately watches when she gets it home), but she also buys the blu-ray, because it's just that awesome!    I don't know if it's the semi-Trekie in me... or my love of cheese... or love of sci-fi, but this movie is awesome! It's how I could see the actors from Star Trek (pick an incarnation) interacting with real aliens. Listen... just buy it. You won't be sorry!!!
0451197879|4.0|A very interesting story about a disgruntled & displaced Laundry executive.  I just dont understand the Richard Bachman thing.  Is it that he feels this kind of story is beneath him (I've read other SK novels that don't merit the S.K. I.D.)?  Or is it that he bashes the corporate culture of America so harshly that he is afraid of being blackballed?  Or, is it the schizoid psychopath he writes about?  I think reason no. 2 is most likely but who knows.  I read his reasoning in the prologue but I still didnt understand his reasoning.  I'll have to read it again.  I recall he said he wanted to let loose and be \\"someone else\\" but I dont buy that.  Like trying a different hair style.  I just don't like the deception.  He said he was (upset) when his secret identity was revealed.  I don't see what the big deal is.  I suspected the Bachman ghost writer was somehow inferior.  It's not.  This is good writing.  It moves right along.  It connects. It impacts.  So why the need for deception?  I still don't understand.  Oh, another reason I though of was his laundry past--SK worked in a laundry as he struggled to make ends meet before his fame and fortune.  Was he ashamed of this?  These are the things that keep me up at night.  LOL.
B004NGYXIM|4.0|Da der Verkaufsstart der CD/DVD in Deutschland mehrfach verschoben wurde und die DVD bis heute nicht angeboten wird, kaufte ich diese direkt in den USA. Die angegebene Lieferzeit entsprach der wirklichen Lieferzeit.  Ich finde die Lieder etwas traurig geraten, was nach dem Schicksalsschlag in Fher's Familie nicht verwunderlich ist. Lluvia al Corazón hat eine schöne Melodie, die im Auto bei angemessener Geschwindigkeit richtig gut 'rüberkommt.  Die DVD gibt einen Einblick in die Entstehung der CD im Studio in Los Angeles. Alles in Dolby 2.0 mit englischen - und spanischen Untertiteln versehen.  Ich hoffe auf eine tolle Tour für Maná und Kopf hoch für die Zukunft!
B000J5XS3C|2.0|What cables are needed to connect this to a computer. I dont find any mention of that in their description.    Update:    I was able to connect it to the laptop with UCA 222.    Update 7/19/11  I ended up returning the whole set up, which included shure 58 microphone, this mixer, uca 222, mic stand, cables. I ordered these items one after the other starting with shure 58 microphone. It took me longer to try them out than the one month allowed for a no charge return. So I had to take a 20% restocking fee hit.    The recording from the shure 58 mic was always blaring when recorded on my computer. Whether I kept the mic close to my lips or away. The on off switch on shure 58 mic did not work.     The humming noise was actually just background noise in my room. Its not sound proof or anything like that. The sensitive microphones like shure 58 probably would pick that noise up. I suppose one of the most important ingredients in home recordings is to have a sound proof room.     In any event I am back to recording with my iphone. For me iphone recording gives me a better quality than the shure 58 did! :)     I am now researching again and will buy better quality equipment next time.    Here is a video that I found helpful on youtube.  [...]
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Tremendous show! Dune has never been made better.  All the characters are faithful to the book.  For those who have never read Dune, do it!  You will see what I mean.  No other Dune video can compare.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've tried several earbuds but they all fall of when excersising. These stay on and the sound pretty good. I'm definitly sticking with these ones!
B0034G4P80|4.0|The only reason I wanted to see \\"Thor\\" was due to the cast and others (Kenneth Branagh for example) involved with the film.  I saw \\"Thor\\" in IMAX 3D and am very glad I did!  The special effects, backdrop and costumes were breathtaking and everyone (Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Chris Hemsworth - - who made an EXCELLENT Thor, by the way, Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgard and Colm Feore) fit their roles well.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the movie being so `dialog-lite' (lol), though I doubt that lesser actors could have pulled off such transparent lines.  It is much better than most superhero movies that have come out in the past 10 years (with the exception of the new Batman movies with Christian Bale).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the film and would probably go to see it again... \\"Thor\\" balanced action, romance, superhero and myth well and it was fun to see such a vividly cast and shot movie on an IMAX 3D screen!  Definitely worth seeing!  I loved it!<br /><br />p.s. Of course, keep watching past the credits to get a little surprise... ;)
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 1 rocks. Can't wait for part 2.  I love harry potter and I got my kids into it too so now we have something special to share. It's a must see series of movies and a must read series of books. I'm both excited and depressed with the last of the series almost upon us.
B00139XZF4|5.0|Love this movie very cool and the shipping is so fast i mean it's fast but the movie case had a split crack but the blue-ray disc was good no scratches!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't usually do reviews. I leave people to judge for themselves. But this short lived show is a masterpiece. I cried at the end. Not because it's sad but because i knew it was the end. You fall in love with these characters and want to continue their journey with them. It may be short but watch it anyway. Slowly. And allow yourself to drown in the glory that is Joss Whedon at his best.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This alarm is flexible and easy enough to use.  Suggest the paid app. for even more features.    I use this alarm daily.
0670022411|3.0|A Discovery of Witches is a terrific read, after page 300.  I understand the author is trying to set up a series, but as much as I enjoyed it, I got tired of the repetitiveness and long passages where nothing seemed to happen or move the story forward.<br /><br />I still liked the book and will probably read the sequel, but I do hope more judicious editing will happen.  Kudos to the author for bringing this story to life.  The most imaginative character in the story is the Bishop house.  I couldn't wait to read what the house would do next with all it's ghosts, along with disappearing/reappearing rooms and cryptic messages.<br /><br />Is it worth the read, yes.  There is a lot to like about this book and for a first effort, it was pretty good.  But I expect the second book to be a lot better especially when the author finds her style and starts putting the story first instead of the research involved.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|A purely impulse purchase, as i just wanted to try this out as a tripod for my Nokia N8.  The devices fits the phone, and also fitted the NOkia N900 a fried had.    The item has the standard camera mount to the plastic holder that actually contains the phone.  This holder has two extensions one for the length and one for the height.  The length adjuster is fairly smooth, but the height adjuster is i think spring based so its very hard to adjusted.    The biggest concern is that the plastic edges are very sharp, and you can scrape your phone when trying to fit it.  In addition the padding in-side is very thing rubber like stickers that do a poor job and also not going to last.    While it does its job, not the device to use with expensive phones you care.
0316056863|4.0|A terrifically enjoyable read from Wonderwoman herself, Tina Fey.  This book can be read in a couple of short sittings and is well worth the time.  \\"Bossypants\\" feels like having a conversation with the woman herself, and a highly enjoyable one at that.  Good stuff and highly recommended!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Non-explicit or just suggested horror works when it is well made (Rosemary's Baby) but that is not the case here.This is just an amateurish home video which never works, never involves you, never scares you. it only causes two reactions, the constant look to your watch and the same question hammering inside your mind during 86 minutes, like, where is the horror? the young woman thinks that some evil spirit is inside her house because of some distant and faint noises, feeble grunts, a door which opens...and closes during the night?I should invite her to stay one night in my apartment, where she would be terrified listening to neighbors dragging furniture, imsomniac housewives cleaning the floor after midnight, hysterical moms shouting to screaming babies, restless footsteps above my head...the big mistake made by these director is that he only  creates expectations, and fails terribly because that is  what you get in the end, only expectations...
B004478GNI|5.0|This fun little set is quick to assemble and fairly durable.  The wings rotate and flex.  139 pieces.  Includes 2 minifigs.<br /><br />Recipient is nine years old and a skilled LEGO builder; it took him 20 minutes to build the entire set independently.  More durable than the Hyena Droid Bomber, thank heavens.<br /><br />Fun for play.
0385751893|5.0|Excellent experience from this seller. The book was in new condition and it arrived when it was supposed to. Will purchase from this seller again.
B004G600A4|5.0|We love this movie, so much so that we watch it at least 3 times a week (thanks to the 3 yr old).
159102594X|5.0|As said in the title, my review covers the 3 books in the series.<br /><br />Simply superb, one of a kind, historical fantasy for adults!<br /><br />I really have to go back and re-read George Martin's Game of Thrones to confirm whether or not he is still on top.<br /><br />If he is, Joe Abercrombie is right next to the throne.<br /><br />Don't loose the opportunity to read these books!
B0050XFXT0|5.0|This episode adds depth to several plot lines and brings to life a character as important as the Doctor himself. Some of the humor has a Mel Brooks feel, really good.     Some of the recent plot twists have had an epic feel with lots of drama and cliff hangers the size of the Grand Canyon. This episode couldn't be more different. It leaves the watcher with a warm sense of satisfaction. River Song is just a blip in his life, his true love will always be with him. Her character is so true to the whole series, her wandering nature, her taking control, her choosing him...it so makes sense.
B004LAIU4I|3.0|Simon cannot top Graceland, but this is not even the best since Graceland. \\"You're the One\\" is more interesting in both rhythm and lyrics. However, the \\"melodies\\" of the songs here are pretty much the same as \\"You're the One.\\" Simply put, the songs here sound like ad lib...very little melody. I got this CD as a gift, and I think it is easy to listen to, but I would not have bought it myself, or would I listen to it more than a few times before storing it away forever.
0316069353|1.0|I agree with other reviews.  To pay these high prices for e-books is highway robbery and we, as consumers, ought to speak through our pocketbooks by boycotting the purchase of these overpriced electronic publications.  If you agree, post your own displeasure.  If you do not agree then please be my guest and pay the asking price.  I am a consumer and I agree with this message.
B002ZG981E|1.0|I turned this thing off 5 minutes into it. It was boring, confusing, and stupid. Don't waste your time. Five minutes lost for me. This movie would be a great torturing device to use instead of water-boarding.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is the BEST of the three ICE AGE movies.  It's hysterical.  LOVE IT!    These are NOT just for children.  Adults can really enjoy the characters' antics.  Get all three of them and, if it's raining all weekend, have fun with Sid, Manny, Diego, and especially Scrat!
0765326353|5.0|I decided to pick up this book based on a recommendation from a friend. This book is the start to his new series, The Stormlight Chronicles, and I couldn't put it down. Being the first book in a series, there tends to be a lot of setup, but hopefully the characters develop later in the series, especially the female character. That said, I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a fantasy series that is completely new, and the world is different from anything you've ever read in any other fantasy series.
B00005NNNG|5.0|Musical taste is not something that can be disputed so I respect that many people I know think this is not Slipknot's best. A lot of metal heads probably don't even like Slipknot either. That's fine and I respect opinions other than my own. Iowa is my favourite Slipknot release to date, and I must say that Slipknot is probably the only American metal band that I can listen to and appreciate. Out of all their releases, this is the one I can listen to all the way through without skipping songs, which for me, is a major accomplishment. The music is heavier than all the other albums, and Corey has more harsh sounding vocals than with their debut. This album was released as a promotional piece if you pre-ordered the \\"Disasterpieces\\" DVD. This is not only a rare album altogether, but the sound is very clean and crisp. It's a double gatefold LP and the title track takes up the entire second side of the second LP (which doesn't surprise me in the slightest -- \\"Iowa\\" is a 14 minute track). I have all of Slipknot's albums on vinyl and I fear this is going to be the one I will wear out first.     If you are lucky enough to find this LP at a reasonable price, you might want to pick it up and give it a listen. :)
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Luv this cd. Stevie's voice is truly timeless and these new songs just confirm how amazing she is. What an incredible feat to be making great music 35 years after Fleetwood Mac began. Her writing is magical and her voice enchantingly haunting. My favorite songs are definitely Secret Love and New Orleans but the entire cd is wonderful. She is truly a legend and still brings her audience to their feet in appreciation of her talent.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|One of the greatest love/comedy movies I have ever seen.  Girlfriend absolutely loves it.  I really relate to the main character, Tristan, who chases a beautiful girl and tries to prove his love to her but comes to realize that you shouldn't have to prove your love to get another to love you. Love should work both ways, where both give without hesitation.  I'm sure most young men are like this where we chase people we shouldn't but as we get older, we realize, \\"If I'm buying her stuff and showing off fancy things, what is she doing for me to prove she loves me?\\".    An excellent adventure!
0061537969|5.0|If you love dogs you will love this book.  I laughed and cried right up to the end.  Buy it you will enjoy it.
0316056863|2.0|I initially wanted to rate this three stars, because I was feeling generous. Very generous. But then I wrote this review, and I realized: two stars is more than enough.    Because this isn't a book. This is a couple of seemingly stand-alone pieces that are glued together by mostly inferior writing. And I expect much better from the woman who once ran the writers' room at Saturday Night Live.    There are the occasional glimpses of what could have been a much more enjoyable read, but you have to endure too much prose that's in dire search of a decent editor. Far too often this book feels like Tina Fey dumped a manuscript on a publisher's desk and said \\"this will do\\" and no one dared to point out \\"well, not exactly...\\" In fact, I repeatedly had the impression she wrote the book against her will, as if it was some kind of contractual obligation.    I don't get why she bothered to write a book about herself, when she clearly doesn't want to reveal anything -- which she inevitably does anyway, even though those things are masked by feeble punchlines and meandering anecdotes.    Biggest disappointments are the pages where she answers online criticism (pointless and sad) and those where she recounts her imitations of Sarah Palin (preposterously self-important).    Clunky. Badly written. Unfunny. Superficial. Tedious. Those aren't words I should be considering when reviewing a book written by a comedian.
B0045DO8NI|5.0|Awesome collection of songs, one new one.  Dvd has excellent selection of music videos and live concert footage.  Perfect collection for any P!nk fan.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|The real victim in this whole thing was Valerie Wilson who emerges as the sole class act in this whole affair. Okay so she co-wrote the book they based the movie upon.<br /><br />he problem was not what Joe Wilson did, but his timing and lack of consultation with his wife. From the movie, he blind sided her with the article as well. He did not have the consideration or forethought to talk to her first, instead going off half-cocked seeking some sort of revenge. They Lied! Yeah, so what. If you are going to out them, wait until things die down and spring it in October right before the election. Wilson, while being patriotic was also portrayed as self-serving his ego. Albeit, he did not think Rove would out his wife, but he should have thought that far ahead. He needed to stop and think about his actions, which didn't save anyone and along with Rove's retaliation got people killed.<br /><br />In spite of Joe Wilson's fight against the WH, Valerie remained true to her CIA rules of silence. She endures threats to her family and media smears. Joe goes on TV against his wife's wishes and she leaves home to stay with her parents. The real drama of the movie is not the Wilson vs. White House, but Wilson vs. Wilson and how Valerie goes from having having no support for Joe Wilson's war (against the White House) and sleeping in separate bedrooms to becoming his ally.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings is Incredible! Such a great book! I started the book with high hopes and finished it completely satisfied. The only concern you should have, would be the beginning. The way he forms the world he creates and the characters he presents are slightly boring at first. So the first 100-200 pages are just slightly boring. But after that, it just keeps getting more intense and riveting. Way to go Brandon for getting 2011 book of the year!
B000BKJ78U|5.0|These three classic films will always be considered as my favorite movies forever. When I first saw them, I fell in love with the memorable characters and story plots. I hope someday I'll get to share them with other new generations in the future. I give two thumbs up. May the Force be with us for eternity!
0307595862|3.0|The latest installment in a series featuring the alcoholic Norwegian police detective Harry Hole.  This book has many of the positive qualities of the earlier books; lever plotting, good attention to detail, competent writing, and a sympathetic main character.  Nesbo, unfortunately, is starting to repeat himself.  Hole's personality and problems have been well explored in prior books.  The plot is perhaps a bit too clever with an overabundance of red herrings.  Nesbo tries to increase suspense by placing Hole's girlfriend and foster son in jeopardy, something he has done previously.  Still better than most books in the genre.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|This was an excellant documentary. It provided a lot of interesting details about the three original classic Star Wars films. It showed a great photo gallery of never-before shown scenes. For anyone who's a major Star Wars fan and love the classics, you should definately add this to your collection today.
B002QBS9KE|4.0|Good product.  Easy on the ears for extended use.  Easy to replace worn ear buds on Voyager headset.    Good online shopping experience.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|Right there on the front of the DVD cover it says \\"You don't have to be a country fan to love this movie\\". Well...you know how every DVD has all kinds of praise from people you don't know on the cover. That's all that is. If you're country it's a strong movie. If you're city it's the wrong movie.<br /><br />This is a pretty good movie and it gets 5-stars if you live in Tennessee and it gets 1-star if you are from New York.<br /><br />There is no denying the fact Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the greatest actors of all time just for the fact very few actors can turn in a legit redneck performance. It takes a redneck to know one and my straw hat is off to Gwyneth. She must have had a dialect coach that grew up watching Hee Haw and the Beverly Hillbillies. It's the greatest redneck performance by a non-redneck of all-time! She's a Skoal dipping surfer chick now. A mobile meth lab away from hanging out at the cement pond with Elly May and Jethro.<br /><br />Here's the entire story. Gwyneth is a former country star that freaks out, gets drunk and old. Her husband don't want her no more. She wants a young singer to curl up in bed with after a hard night of drinking and her husband wants the same thing. Predictible relationship twists and turns. The end.<br /><br />Tim McGraw plays the husband of a 40-something year old still hot former country music star. Something he does in real life everyday. McGraw is good in the role of \\"Husband\\" to 40-something chicks in movies. It's just his role. He's good at it.<br /><br />The old skool country music is really great in this movie but if you don't like country don't bother. The entire movie looks like it was filmed in and around the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, a hotel room, a tour bus and a bar. By that I mean it could have all been done in the same 1/4 of a mile radius with some stock road sign footage added. Not a lot of scenery that's going to \\"pop\\" on the Blu Ray.<br /><br />It's like you got some really top of the line cameras, your best female friend was a great actor, everyone else was just glad to be there, you wrote a decent script but didn't have enough money to travel so you stayed in one spot in one Tennessee town and made a movie.<br /><br />Country Strong couldn't carry Coal Miner's Daughter's spitcup but it would look good with it in a DVD two-pack at Wal-Mart.veryone else was just glad to be there, you wrote a decent script but didn't have enough money to travel so you stayed in one spot in one Tennessee town and made a movie.     Country Strong couldn't carry Coal Miner's Daughter's spitcup but it would look good with it in a DVD two-pack at Wal-Mart.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|My daughter and son-in-law loved this gift.  The remaster of the music was EXCELLENT and they loved all the bonus items.  The Beatles will never be out-dated and each generation still enjoys this timeless music as much as I did as a kid and still do.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|There're cheaper devices that look similar on the market, but I decided not to chance it and went with the unit that's sold in Apple stores.  I wasn't disappointed.  Worked immediately with success.  Just be sure to keep the enclosed instructions on how to configure your Mac's System Preferences, and you'll see everything on your TV screen that can be seen on your Mac.  Simple as that!
078884461X|5.0|This movie can be enjoyable for a child or an adult. The first time i saw this i fell in love with the movie and purchased it quickly; now me and my baby brother have a movie we can both enjoy.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I'm a bit of a purist, and we are impossible to please for the most part.  I liked the fact that the movie tried very hard to stick to the main important plot elements of the story, but because this is a book (a LONG book) turned into a movie, they had to rush the plot in order to fit things in, and this was worsened by the addition of a completely STUPID scene of Harry and Hermione dancing to the radio after Ron's desertion.  Completely pointless, and the time they wasted on it could have been put to sooo much better use - expanding on the story of Regulus Black, for example.  Ah well.  Waiting for the next one, now...
B00503BN1M|5.0|I didn't think I would like this, because I'm not a huge Ashton Kutcher fan.  But this is a much see!  It's funny, charming, and touching.  Ashton was so cute and Natalie was great!  It's kind of a chick flick but I think the men will enjoy it too!  This is a must see romantic comedy.
0812550706|5.0|One of my favorite Sci-Fi novels! You'll find this one hard to put this down once you've started. This book is the first in the Ender series but stands on it's own and will leave you satisfied if you decide not to read the later books, however, I have a feeling once you finish this one you will want to check out the others. Enjoy.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Yes I gotta agree with my Mom that Iron Man 1 was better than Iron Man 2. It is very subtle but it is there. Don Cheadle was an injustice to Terence Howard. In the pursuit of perfection as viewed in \\"The Making of\\", the personalities of the characters got nixed. If it was because of comments akin to Rick Sanchez or Mel Gibson that did Terence Howard in, then they are baseless paranoic delusions. My suspicion points to clown director/cameo Jon Navreau who maybe had a hand in this. Its too bad that the Khazarian (...) has to do these things but is it inevitable?
B003MTGW80|4.0|Familiar territory with Giulini at the helm.  The man had a terrificly small repertoire, most of which was done with great authority and elan.  But here, in his late career, tempi are mostly very slow, to the point of trying one's patience.    Exceptions abound, though, enough that make this a worthy purchase for the Giulini afficionado.  Standouts include the Schumann 3rd and Manfred Overture, the Debussy and Ravel disc, and, especially for me, the Beethoven 5th - with the repeat taken in the last movement, and performed with pitch-perfect intensity.    But!  Where in heaven's name is the live Falstaff recording???  This is a huge omission from Giulini's Deutsche Grammophon/Los Angeles catalogue.  A cherished recording, to be sure, especially for those who were lucky enough to attend one of the performances of this truly grand opera.    I'd love to know the reasoning behind DG's decision to leave out the Verdi, when it was such an important occasion for the maestro - his return to the opera house after many, many years' absence.    Ah well, it is still available separately via Amazon, but not many in stock...perhaps going out of print soon?  One hopes not!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I rented this but I wish one of the major networks would air this in its entirety.  They went after Madoff, Martha Stewart and Kenneth Lay yet the heads and others within these financial institutions were never prosecuted?  How is this possible?  Regardless of your political preference, what is President Obama doing?   He campaigned against this yet these people have gotten away with fraud and theft.  If more american people saw this, perhaps those involved would be put where they belong.    This is a fabulous piece of history which clearly outlines what was going on and those involved.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I got this recently and it feels and plays great. I use this as my primary controller and the DS3 as my backup. Would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a controller that's like the 360 controller. I read that some people say the controller have to be in direct line of sight with the usb attachment, but I did not experience this. My PS3 is on top of a wall unit and when I lie on the couch about more than 2 metres away, it's kinda hidden from the controller and I don't lose the connection at all. Also, there may be a teeny little dead zone on my controller, but it's hardly noticable. I tried it on games like Uncharted 2, Infamous, Killzone, etc. and it works well enough that I'd rather use this than the DS3. Bottom line, this is well worth it and highly recommended, whether you're looking for a replacement or an xbox 360 clone for the PS3.
032147404X|5.0|This book doesn't waste any time, it just gets right to the information you need to take pro-level digital photos.  The only thing in the way are small banter in between the information, but that's okay because it's really humorous and sometimes makes the read even faster.<br /><br />I bought this in 2009 and still refer to it.  I'm no pro photographer, I'm just a video guy who sometimes needs to shoot stills on a DSLR and this has been the best photo guide I've purchased so far.  Now I'm going to get Vol. 2.
044654146X|5.0|This is an excellent book that not only analyzes in detail how and why Israel became the nation of startups and its resulting economic success, but also what is required at a national, corporate and personal levels for becoming more innovative and entrepreneurial.  There is definitely something that we Americans can learn from the Israelis!
0671004107|5.0|It's hard to know where to begin this review.  I just finished re-reading this book and my thoughts aren't really settled yet.  That happens every time I read it - the ending is so powerful and yet so simple, it inspires strong emotions.    I guess the thing that gets me with \\"Contact\\" is that it works on so many levels.  It's an adventure story (receiving a signal from space and the events that follow).  It's a biographical account of an incredible woman (the main character).  It's an interesting look at our recent past (the late 90s) from a 1985 perspective.  It's an interesting comparison of religion vs science, written by a scientist who obviously was not ready to completely give up on religion.    There are also a couple of messages that always hit me when I read this book.     First, a common argument between science and religion is the age of the universe and the role of \\"God\\" in creating the universe.  Various religions have their stories of how God created the Earth and the Heavens and human beings, etc.  But what if \\"God\\" is actually responsible for creating billions of galaxies and planets and beings?  What if the universe isn't a random collection of atoms and molecules...what if it really is all part of a plan so big that it really can't even be comprehended?  Isn't that even more incredible than what's in the Bible or the Koran or the Tao Te Ching?    And second, in a universe so vast, how can we - who are so small - make it through?  How can we not be overcome by the galactic forces that are so powerful?  By believing in the strongest galactic force of all - love.    Probably not the messages you would expect in a science fiction book, but then, \\"Contact\\" is not your typical science fiction book.  It's really a simple story of hope.  And that's something we could all use more of.
0345529057|3.0|The book series is AMAZING.     The 3 stars is for the physical books themselves. These books are a lot smaller than I expected them to be, almost impossible to read at the gym. Dimensions: 4\\" x 7\\"
B0011Z77OK|4.0|RHCP is a great rock band, and they have plenty of great rock songs on this record, but honestly I can't remember the names of the songs in the second half of the album. Also, this album is missing \\"Can't Stop\\" which was a big hit on the radio, and I can't believe they didn't put that song on. Take note that this album came out before Stadium Arcadium, so don't expect any songs like \\"Dani California\\" or \\"Snow (Hey Oh).\\"
B000FC1PNE|5.0|My favorite Julai Quinn's book! i absolutely loved the two main characters! Penelope and Colin's love story was one of the best in all the historical books! if you like the cool popular guy that falls in love with the shy and plain jane girl, you will adore this book! I personnaly liked the final scene of the book! You cn see that those two really love each other  and that Colin would do anything for Penelope!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|There's no possible justification for the price of this Kindle edition to be twice that of the paperback edition, other than price gouging. Everyone should give the kindle edition 1 star because that is the only way we can stop this kind of pricing.
B004LGPBZI|4.0|Beady Eye's debut LP is a solid if not great almbum. Go into it with an open mind and you will be quite impressed. Many great tracks pn this record. Liams voice in in great form and his best vocal performance in wuite sometime. The album has a crisp sheen yet raw sound. You can feel the energy and exitement. Stand out tracks Wigwam,For anyone, The Roller, Kill for a Dream, Three Ring Circus,The Beat goes on and Morning Son. Not a bad track on the record. Will anticipate the next release.
0439023513|3.0|\\"It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.\\"<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is alive, but her home of District 12 is in ruins.  She and her family now reside in District 13.  The rising government, led by President Coin, wants her to act as their \\"mascot\\" of sorts.  Katniss agrees, but at the forefront of her mind is Peeta's fate and assassinating President Snow.<br /><br />I Liked:<br />One thing you can't say about Collins is that she sugarcoats her story.  And I think that is what I admire so much about her.<br />Katniss goes to hell and back in this book, and we see it all.  We see that heroes aren't these shiny Luke Skywalkers, bright-eyes, eager to fight, with absolutely no qualms about killing or thoughts about the families of those he is killing, believing 100% into the Rebellion, and so on.  Katniss isn't that hero.  When there are explosions, she spends time in the hospital healing.  When there are crises, she panics and thinks only of her family.  She doesn't want to be a part of the revolution; she doesn't want the burden.  This is admirable for an author: to write the protagonist as a REAL person, one who isn't sold on the ideals of the Rebellion, one who is selfish, one who is at the whim of others.<br />Likewise, Peeta undergoes some serious torture at the hands of President Snow, yet he doesn't miraculously turn around and act like his old usual self as if nothing happens.  He struggles to return to himself and, like Frodo in Lord of the Rings, he finds that he can't return to the way he was before.  Too much has changed.<br />While it is also a detriment to the pacing of the novel, the slow setup in the first two sections is very realistic.  Too often, novels just go, go, go and don't bother to deal with the feelings of the protagonists or the real-world actions.  But Collins shows us the mundane, the day-to-day events, and the boring aspects to Rebellion.  Propaganda.  Security drills.  Training.  The \\"hurry up and wait\\" mentality.  She doesn't skip over this stuff to get to the \\"good stuff\\".<br />When the action in the third section picks up, it gets really intense.  I found myself reading through it more quickly, wondering how Katniss and the gang were going to survive and surprised when people died (another kudos to Collins for killing off her repertoire of characters instead of having everyone miraculously survive).<br /><br />I Didn't Like:<br />This is one of those books I started eons ago that took me weeks to finish.  And part of the problem is in the first two thirds of the book, the setup.<br />While it may be more realistic to talk about Katniss' healing, her depression, her wandering around doing nothing, from a reading standpoint, it is BORING.  Especially when Katniss ends up having the same discussions as always.  Worrying about her family.  Fretting over Peeta.  Wanting to fight but being held back by the Rebellion.  Over and over and over.  Again, while I admire the honesty of portraying Katniss in such a light (certainly it's not very flattering), it doesn't make the best storytelling.<br />Oddly enough, while focusing so much on Katniss' psychological turmoil and more, some changes happen almost at the speed of light.  SPOILERS: Some events that could have used more explanation include: President Snow's death, what happened after the big explosion outside the mansion (the cutting to black was a cheap trick in my opinion), Peeta's recovery, and Gale's instantaneous decision to move to District 2. END SPOILER<br />And then there's the complaint about how similar the pods are to the Hunger Games.  I mean, really?  The Capitol sets these destructive pods in their own city on the off-chance they would get attacked (which hasn't happened in the last 75 years?).  That just sounds like an OSHA violation WAITING to happen.<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:<br />Virtually none.  Maybe a mild da** or he**, but that is it.<br />Finnick and Annie consummate their relationship off-screen at one point.  Katniss and Peeta recall all the kissing they've done over the past few books.<br />The violence is, once again, the heaviest part of the book.  From the devastating traumas that Katniss encounters to the traps set into the streets of the Capitol, there is plenty of violent bloodshed.  While not overly gory, Collins doesn't shy away from it.<br /><br />Overall:<br />While the conclusion itself is oddly, very satisfying, it takes a lot of work to get to it.  If you've read the previous two books, I would definitely recommend, but be warned: you may find yourself napping in the first two thirds and having a case of deja vu in the final third.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I built a new PC to process my pictures and DVDs using Photoshop Elements as my old PC was obsolete.  This processor is a great compromise of hi-speed Quad core to do the job well.  I added a CoolerMaster V8 Processor Cooler in case I ever choose to over-clock the unit for gaming. The cooler that comes with the processor would probably do the job for normal activity, but I chose to built \\"bigger is better\\" rather than do add-ons in the future.  Very pleased with the outcome.

B0050XFXT0|5.0|well I'll say it. What a woman/11 dimensional matrix folded into a mechanical construct!<br /><br />Suranne Jones played the charactor in question. She was excellent! I loved the way she and Smith portrayed a relationship that had existed for 700 years and was brand new at the same time. Her lines were so funny she made me laugh out loud during the show. I loved her calling him a thief. Her thief. It happened to be the literal truth. On every level. I loved this episode and thank Mr. Gaiman for it as well as hope for more him in future.<br /><br />The whole name/Sexy thing was perfect! Do you remember when Rose and Sarah Jane were talking about how the Doctor would stroke the TARDIS. It made perfect sense that he would fall for the magic box who stole him.<br /><br />I will have to make a point of watching her other shows. She was sexy, mad and truly The Doctor's Wife. Sorry, River but you may marry The Doctor but he will always love the TARDIS and now that we have met her, I can understand his choices.<br /><br />\\"Biting, it's like kissing but there's a winner.\\" - Idris / TARDIS / Sexy
0515141429|5.0|You know that you have a great book when you actually forget that the main protagonist is not the author. Jack Reacher was so real to me that I have a hard time remembering that Lee Child has written his story. Jack is a loner but he has a strong sense of justice. Luckily for him he is no longer tied to any agency and therefore is not held back by policy and red tape.<br /><br />Jack makes a decision to hop off a Greyhound bus at a clover leaf exchange and make a trip down to Margrave, GA. It came close to being the worst mistake of his life. Jack is arrested and thrown in a cell. Apparently he murdered someone last night. Didn't matter that he was in Florida at the time of the murder. He bides his time thinking that it is only a matter of time before they realize they have the wrong man. Jack is around long enough though to realize that something isn't quite right in Margrave. He's enjoying his freedom and doesn't want to get caught up in business that means nothing to him. That is until Jack Reacher is taken by complete surprise (a difficult feat) and personally drawn into it.<br /><br />Lee Child is brilliant. I don't think I can put it any other way. The man deserves all the praise you've read about. I didn't have anything figured out until Jack Reacher himself started explaining it to me. It was amazing. I kept thinking: \\"There's something that will go wrong with this book. Some plot line left unresolved, something that will go unexplained.\\" I am so satisfied with this book that I can't wait to devour the rest! I gave this book an adults only rating because it is gory and violent and there were parts that made me flinch. If you love a good thriller and have somehow missed Lee Child, do yourself a favor and get your hands on a copy today!
B004R0WKNE|5.0|I loved this movie!  Saw the preview awhile ago in the theatre and knew it would be great for a Saturday night renter!  It was every bit as good as I had hoped....even better, actually!  If you're looking for a cute movie with a good story....this is it!
0439023521|4.0|I tried really hard not to like The Hunger Games at first. I was worried that I would like the book simply because everyone else did. Once I started reading it though, I could not put it down. It's dark for sure but you find yourself liking Katniss so much that if she can handle it so can you.<br /><br />Every year one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts are thrown into a specifically built arena to fight to the death. There is only one winner. Katniss and Peeta are drawn for the poverty stricken District 12. Peeta displayed a great act of kindness when they were younger. He gave Katniss hope in a time when all seemed hopeless. How can she kill him? With the help of their sponsor and her own sharp wit Katniss will give the Capitol a shock they may not be ready for!
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|This DVD was by far my greatest purchase ever :]  I had trouble finding this movie in my small town so it was relieving to find it online at a desirable price. Fight Club has become my cult-classic movie of choice, due to the great story line and acting, and because it also led to my current relationship. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Chuck Palahniuk's works, whether by book or film. It's a wonderful film for Brad Pitt lovers as well. With its many quotable lines and talented actors, Fight Club can teach everyone something; \\"Sticking feathers up your butt doesn't make you a chicken.\\" If I could make any sort of difference by giving my rating, I'd give a five out of five stars.
1936594293|5.0|*happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.<br /><br />I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.<br /><br />I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written.

B004SKHJF2|4.0|I installed the latest versions of Shazam Encore and SoundHound Infinity on a Motorola Xoom.  I then selected 50 songs with varying degrees of obscurity, played them back one at a time and asked each app to identify it.  I tried to use the same segment of the song for each app, usually the very beginning.  If it couldn't identify the song from the beginning, I fast-forwarded to the chorus and tried from there.<br /><br />Shazam properly identified 31 of the songs, claimed it could not identify 19 and made no incorrect guesses.<br />SoundHound properly identified 32 of the songs, claimed it could not identify 10, and made 8 incorrect guesses.<br /><br />SoundHound was much faster when it was confident about a song, but slower if it wasn't sure.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|you are going to half to get to part t when the fun begians so dont put the book down give it a chance
B00313PLIO|5.0|If there were more stars I could give for this movie, there would be thousands! Of course, this movie might not be enjoyable for everyone. However, this is my absolute favorite movie out of the 800+ movies that I own. Definitely a good buy!
B001UV4XI8|4.0|Overall this movie was fun to watch but, it felt a bit rushed to me even though it was a 2 hour movie on it's own. The book contains so much detail that to really do it justice would probably take 3 movies. I'm looking forward to the last movie in July and hopefully the finale will live up to the rest of the series.
0307593495|4.0|1) As the last book in a very long series this book makes many references to the other books. It is not a book you can read by itself and enjoy. It is a book built on nostalgia for the past which had been lived by the main character.    2) There is a murder mystery but it is not the main driver in the book. It is interesting but hardly at the level of tension in the previous books in the series.    3) There is a political statement in the book which may not sit well with some American readers. I won't say what it is since it would spoil the book, but when you read it and think about it you may find it ....well, laughable. You'll be saying did what?, why? I'm guessing if your Swedish this may appear plausible.    4) Kurt Wallander the main character is a very old 60 year old who suffers from medical maladies. He's pondering his life and the future a lot. I would say for 35% of the book. I would not recommend to anyone under 50 years old since I think they would find the constant examination tiring. For me it was right on but hardly illuminating since he finds few answers.    5) Kurt, family, ex lovers, friends,  and love continues to be a difficult and unhappy thing...    6) Its the last in the series. You'll find the ending in the last paragraph of the last page very abrupt. For me, having experience with the conclusion, I found the ending off putting. I believe the author meant it as poetic. It may of been the only ending possible.     Finally, I would say if you've read the others in the series and watched Kurt's life unfold then this book is a must read. If you haven't don't bother reading this one, yet. Start at the beginning. You'll be reward in living the life of Kurt Wallander.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Not as fast paced as today's movie story telling, but it is a classic romance - clean - some humor and a well written and beautifully filmed movie.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Fantastic album.  There are the obvious hits, but even the more album oriented tunes are interesting.  Was intrigued enough to buy the disk after their Grammy performance... and after listening to this album I'll be exploring the rest of their catalogue.

I couldn't believe that for years I was putting this, &#34;Drug-Like&#34; food substance in my body. It answers every question to, &#34;Why am I sick?<br /><br />Also, when I read that producing Sugar was one of the main reasons for the Slave Trade, I thought my God, my God!

B0030ZOYHC|4.0|Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most acclaimed anime series of all time, and for good reason.  Its story is deep, multi-layered and mature; something that many people believe is beyond the range of anime.  For those non-believers, check out this sereies.    Now for the bluray itself, it's a beautiful work of art.  The redone scenes are phenomenal, and the content of the original show is truncated down to a pace that suits a single-sitting movie's timeframe.  If you want the real Evangelion experience however, watch the series first.  This movie is more like a delicious dessert to savor after enjoying the main course.  Watching this movie first will be an enjoyable experience, but in the long-run you'll be left feeling a bit confused, as the full experience manages to do that to first time viewers despite its full content.    The redone Evangelion movie series is a must-have for any anime fan, and is a great place to look for a non-fan looking for proof that there's more to anime than big eyes and cat-ears.
1593357370|5.0|I can't describe the book any better than the other reviewers have. All I can say is now I'm a Reacher addict. I'll have to have them all. I purchased this on MP3 from AudioAddict, since I \\"read\\" by listening to books, and the price was unbeatable with the service excellent.
B00008A7QK|1.0|I ordered this product on 04/12/11 and have yet to receive it. I have sent mulitple emails and last week was told that they resent the item, but I still have not seen it in my mailbox.

B00004CWO8|1.0|After seeing Bourne's NYC performance a number of years ago I knew I needed this DVD for my collection.  I read the reviews and learned that the earlier version came with a fat booklet, which I wanted.  The later version lacked that detail, reportedly.  It was shipped promptly, but I was unable to find time to view it for maybe six weeks and by that time the shipping papers had been recycled.  The version I was sent is intended to be played in \\"Western Europe, Japan, and South Africa\\".  Not Maine, USA.  I can play it on my laptop, but not my home theatre.  My advice?  Go ahead and order this, but don't wait to see if it is playable on your equipment.  Try it right away.  I shall order another version, but there's no way I can play this copy.  I know it didn't come FROM Amazon, but it did come VIA Amazon.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|I am a huge Twilight fan and I thought Eclipse was the best of the saga so far. I loved the fight scene and the increasing passion between Bella and Edward!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|After viewing Inside Job on Netflix, I wanted to own a copy of this eye-opening film.  Several aspects of the financial meltdown were covered on NPR , and this film was even more comprehensive  in telling how much of the developed world came to be overextended in borrowing and close to bankruptcy..  Some of the causes were loosening of regulations of purchasing real estate, e.g., no doc mortgages, use of derivatives  and bundling and securitizing  mortgages, credit default swaps ( many buyers of insurance for the same entity),etc.  Credit rating agencies ignored warning signs and rated worthless paper AAA, Whistle blowers were derided at   hearings. Some professors of economics at prestigious colleges weren't careful enough in  assessing  a nation's economic health, so it seems.  This is one of the most gripping stories in my lifetime.  Too bad it came at almost everyone's expense.  View this, share this, speak up about this.  You must know this!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this sound track and can't wait to see the show.  I advise reading the book and listening to the music for the full effect.  It's so wicked!!!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me! You've got a really good PG film, and all these right-wing parents come out of the closet screaming about the appropriateness of a PG film -- for children! That is why we have a rating system mom and dad! Read the bloody warnings BEFORE taking Johnny & Susie to the theater! Unbelievable! Are Americans really getting stupider? (They will be in Wisconsin & NYC when they trash all their educators!) Anyway, this really is a 5-Star non-Pixar Animated Film! I can't wait to see it again on DVD!
0465022227|5.0|Peter Fiebelman may be an \\"old dinosaur\\" but he survived and flourished as a career research scientist when too many die out. The point he makes on the importance of mentoring for junior post-docs were particularly valuable.  Enough said. Stop reading the reviews and buy the book.
1932100660|5.0|Maybe the answer to our health care costs is a change in dietary choices.  Dr. Campbell has studied nutrition and its effect on health for decades.  This is a must read for anyone interested in maintaining good health throughout his or her lifetime.  This book is well written and a very interesting read.  We chose to become vegans nine months ago, and haven't regretted it for a minute.  If you are considering changing your dietary habits this book will help you with that decision.
B004G6009K|5.0|This is the best Disney I've seen in quite a while. Very cute movie for both boys and girls of many ages. I have a 2 year old and he liked the horse the best. The singing is always good too!  Very satisfied with my purchase. I even got the four-disc combo cheaper on Amazon than it was during all the sales.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|So sad to see what happened to this series.The early Final Destination movies were good but this one is so bad.I heard that there is going to be anthor one after this one.Let's hope it doesn't get any worse than this.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book should be the book you give to your friend who you want to get into runnimg, your friend who should be getting into running, or just your regular running buddy. Every time I picked it up and started reading I wanted to put it down and start running. Being an avid runner already, it was the perfect description of why I love the sport. It's a well written and inspirational story that keeps you engaged all the way through. Whenever anybody asks me &#34;why do you love running so much?&#34; I'll point them to this book because it explains the reason better then I ever could.
1594744769|4.0|So the book is really a mix of concepts you've definitely seen before but all mixed together in one story.  A group of children that would be considered old fashioned circus freaks become the peculiar children in Miss Peregrine's home.<br /><br />Jacob was raised hearing stories about these children from his grandfather.  Of course as he got older and older he came to realize his grandfather must surely be making these stories up.  No children could possibly shoot flames from their hands, lift things that adults cannot, etc.  Pictures can faked, right?  As he watched his grandfather die, confused and depressed about what he saw Jacob falls into a deep depression.  A counsellor convinces his family that yes, he should go learn about his grandfather's life back on the island where Miss Peregrine's home had been.  Perhaps he'll reconcile the stories with the truth and get some peace of mind about who he grandfather was since he was still getting letters from there a mere 15 years earlier, perhaps someone is still alive to help him piece it all together.<br /><br />Instead Jacob finds a bombed out building - as in bombed back in the war in 1940 and no one from that house was seen alive after.  So how was his grandfather still hearing from his friends in this house?<br /><br />Every time Jacob feels he's finding any answers, he gets hit with more questions.<br /><br />There's people that make no sense.  Time structures that make no sense.  But then again, Jacob has never really made sense so for him it's all a welcome change of pace to his usual life.<br /><br />I really debated between 3, 4, and 5 stars.  There are parts of this book that really work well and I loved.  Other parts that are just slow and drawn out.  As I was reading I kept thinking to myself please please don't try to turn this into a series - keep it one story.  Don't give it unnecessary bad guys just to stretch it out.  And sure enough there at the end... Stretching out the story with bad guys it doesn't need.  Clearly trying to turn it into the now mandatory trilogy.  There is so much that could have been done with the story without all of that.  In fact it almost seemed as though the main fight scene was an after thought.<br /><br />In the end I can't ignore what it did wrong, but do feel it's better than 3 stars.  I just hope that in the next book, which will surely happen, the author works out the kinks and realizes this is more about the peculiar children and the lives they're stuck with and less about those silly bad guys and the drama they bring - just kill them off and deal with the kids, their real battles didn't even require baddies when people like Jacob or minutes spent outside of the loop cause their real issues - glimpses of what they're missing.into the now mandatory trilogy.

B0001LJCPC|4.0|Every time I play this CD it brings back memories of scenes from the movie. But unlike watching the DVD, when I play it in my car the sound surrounds me so it definitely feels like theme music. Good stuff to cruise to on the open road.

1439177783|4.0|i wasn't sure about this book when i first brought it, but it came highly recommended so i thought i  would give it a go. Once i started it, i couldn't put it down ! I loved it, it was very well written, informative, honest and moving.
B002SJIO54|5.0|This is THE best science fiction film ever made. The plot has lots of holes and inconsistencies, what film doesn't? The only science fiction film that even comes close to this film is \\"Enemy Mine\\". This film does have a beating heart and it belongs to Christopher Johnson(the alien). At it's core, \\"District 9\\" is a take off from a short story by Franz Kafka with a lot of Neill Blomkamp's South African memories thrown in. The lead actor, Sharlto Copley does an absolutely amazing job as the hapless, Wikus Van De Merwe, who starts off as a cubicle jerk and ends up transformed into a prawn (as the aliens in the movie are called). Considering that Copley ad libbed his lines without a script, the acting here is pretty interesting.  Unfortunately, Wikus the main character, does deserve his fate, no matter how you feel about him. A small hint: Wikus is not the hero of this film and is actually as much a victim as the prawns are. The movie is in reality part warning of uncontrolled Government/Corporate/Crony Capitalism/Overwheening human greed and part warnings about rampant overpopulation. The humans in this film with the exception of Fundiswa Mhlanga(Wikus's black assistant) are all the bad guys in one way or another. You end up seeing the aliens as victims, who even when using violence it is more to protect themselves and lash out at their human tormenters rather than trying to be evil themselves. One thing left out of the descriptions by most reviewers is an underlying plot element hinting at a war between the Prawns(aliens) and some other species out there in the universe. It is only hinted at in Blomkamp's storyline but shows up in the way the Prawn(alien) leadership was mysteriously killed before the film opens and the ship drifting into Earth orbit and over Johannesburg.     This is a very interesting film and not the typical fare you get from hollywood. Watch it and you will see...
0920668372|5.0|This book is timeless and makes a wonderful gift for the parents of any little boy...no matter what age that \\"little boy\\" actually happens to be!  I received my first copy of this book the year it was first published, from a dear friend who had known my son since he was born.  She told me it was new book release and that I would absolutely LOVE this book, especially since the little guy on the front looked exactly like my son did at that age.  With that dark curly hair, big blue eyes, and impish grin, the book cover said it all.  And yes, my son actually DID throw his dad's watch into the toilet when he was a toddler, just to see what would happen...after he had unrolled toilet paper ALL over the bathroom.  Needless to say, I cried when I opened it, and continued to cry all the way to the end.  At the time, all I wished for was that my boy would grow up into the kind of man who would gladly rock his own mother to sleep when she could no longer do the rocking herself.  So yesterday, that little boy (who is all grown up now) just became the brand new daddy of our family's first grandchild...also a little boy with dark curly hair, big blue eyes, and the beginnings of an impish grin...just like his daddy.  So, guess who's getting this book for his very first Father's Day?
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|Fun game but it causes both my and my wifes droid x's to crash and reboot randomly. Otherwise its good stuff
0307477479|5.0|We are so happy to have discovered Egan; this is a fabulous book, by turns clever, deeply moving and compelling. What a talent. Thank you!
B003Y5H53S|1.0|My daughter went to this movie with MY BOSS.  She wanted to treat her to a movie and Rango appeared to be a good kids movie.  Most of the content was over her head.  All she can tell me is that there was a really mean, scary snake in the movie.  She has no idea what the story is about.  In addition I was horrified to find them using four letter words.  All of the adults in our party left the theater speechless.    If you are an adult who enjoys strange humor and stories and enjoys westerns, go for it.  I you are a parent looking for a good kids movie, this IS NOT it.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Don't have cable or internet so able to view this on dvd, loved the series and nice to watch one chapter after another and not have to wait a week if I didn't want too.  Makes lots more sense when you can view it all at once
0345529057|5.0|If you like this genre as I do, you will thoroughly enjoy it.  G.R.R. Martin wrote each character, scene, place, setting with great detail and displayed his mastery with the language of that time.  The story is full of intrigue and conflict.  The heros fight against evil from several fronts, against evil doers in the south and north, then also there is the great terrible winter.  The tale moves fast and is easy to read.  And as far as its worthiness to read with the HBO series under way, I think it's better in the sense of how a book is nearly always better than the movie, which is saying a lot, since the HBO production is so well done.  To those who find it hard to keep up with all the charactors names and roles, as well as the many different places they travel throughout the book, I will recomend the HBO Game of Thrones website that makes it easy to keep it all together in your mind.
B004TL0J5M|1.0|When the hardcover is cheaper then the kindle version, there is something wrong!!!! So I won't buy this book. I´m very sorry, because Conelly is my favorite writer!
630512762X|1.0|The shipping went quite well but I didn't care for the movie.  Truthfully speaking, it sucked and was pretty much the worst movie I've ever seen, except for of course another bad movie I have seen, UHF with Weird Al Yankovic.
0440237688|5.0|This is a truly amazing story that follows one boy's pursuit to truth about his society. I read the first half of this book with middle school students and what I found interesting was that they were stuck on the peculiarity of this society.  We would go on in the story and the discussion would always go back to how different the society was. The story also made students think about how there are limitations in our own society, questions that no one is really answering. This is a wonderfully written story that makes you wonder why we view things the way we do. This book really made me think, making it entertaining and relevant for teenagers and adults.
B00003CXFU|3.0|Even though this movie was new and in its original package, due to the age of the movie itself there were some scratches in the sound. I guess it goes to show that you always take a chance when you purchase an older movie.
0307454541|4.0|I can't read Swedish, so I don't know if the original writing was poor.<br /><br />The English translation is poorly written, full of cliched writing and over used, stale phrasing.  The translator will also get on a kick and reuse phrasing multiple times in one section of the book.  At times it seems like the translation was written by two different people.<br /><br />An example of poor writing is the constant use of the phrase \\"on the other hand\\".  It is basic writing 101, that the phrase \\"on the other hand\\" should only be used after the phrase \\"on the one hand\\".  But, in any case, it is a trite and simplistic phrase.  And there are paragraphs where the trnaslator uses the phrase up to three times and sections in the book where it is in several paragraphs in a row.<br /><br />The story is good, and interesting.  It is not fantastic and anything mind blowing or even anything that original.  There are some very interesting characters in the book, which make it worth reading.<br /><br />I wasn't blown away by the book, but it was interesting enough that I wanted to read the next 2.
0425166805|4.0|i've only read about half of this book and i already fully understand the whole idea daniken writes about. the book gets very repetitive, maybe it could just be me because i watched the first season of ancient aliens before reading the actual book. If you have already seen ancient aliens or anything based off this book, nothing in this book is going to be new to you. also i found false information such as hernan cortez coming to south america and conquering the natives (it was actually fransisco pizarro) and acouple of others.     i would still recommend this book because the ancient alien theory is really interesting.
0670022411|5.0|I got the first chapter of this on my kindle just to try..and whoa did it suck me in. I fell completely head over heels into the story. To me, it was one of those stories that I was 'stuck' in and kept thinking about even when I had put the book down. I am anxiously awaiting the next installment.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|So nice to have Stevie still rocking and coming up with some great material.  The title track is worth the price of the CD.  Kickass song.
B002ZG99CM|1.0|I just watched the remake of the Karate Kid. Compared to the original movie, this remake is mediocre. Jaden Smith's acting is borderline at best, you really don't care much about his character. Jackie Chan did what he could with the limitations of his part. I thought the woman who played his mother, did a decent job. Outside of that, don't waste your money on this remake. Purchase the original!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I finished reading Game of Thrones this morning and I thought a review of the book was in order, despite having mentioned it already on several occasions. Be warned there are spoilers present! So without further delay, here is how George R. R. Martin made me into a fan of epic fantasy:<br /><br />1. He altered my preconceived notions of what an epic fantasy is supposed to be. In my head, all epic fantasy was simply a retelling of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. It all contained elves and wizards and dragons. Magic played a big role. Ambitious quests were the order of the day. And it was almost always good versus evil. Game of Thrones broke all the rules in this respect. The \\"dwarf\\" was so through a birth defect. There were no wizards. While magic was hinted at, we see almost none in the book. There were no quests. Nor was there a clear good or evil. (Joffrey seems evil, but he's really just a kid trying to be a man.) From the moment I started reading the book, it was not at all what I expected. And that was refreshing.<br /><br />2. His characters were among the most complex people I've come across in science fiction and fantasy (Connie Willis has equally complex characters in her novels.) These are not characters who necessarily behave the way their position dictates. A fighter isn't always brave. A lady isn't always meek. An old man isn't always wise and a young boy isn't always a child. The burdens of the leaders of men weigh heavily upon them and that comes through in the book. By the end of the book, I began to feel like I knew some of the characters so well that I could guess at their reactions to a situation and be pleased to find that I was usually right. They feel like friends to me, not caricatures.<br /><br />3. His world-building is masterful without being intrusive. There is enough of the world and its background to give you a good understanding of the time and place of the events, without taking you out of the story. And yet, there is enough hinted at but not said to leave you wondering. For instance: how on Earth did they build that wall? The society is a complex one (after all, it is a melding of seven kingdoms, each with its own rich history) but it is presented clearly in the narrative at times and places that are appropriate to the story. Unlike Tolkien, Martin doesn't step out of the story to give a lengthy history (except, perhaps, once toward the end of the book when Bran is learning about the early days of his people). The laws in this universe are self-consistent and add value to the story as a whole.<br /><br />4. He makes you forget you are reading epic fantasy. Instead, from almost the very beginning, you feel like you are integrated into the lives of people in a world that is different from our own, but still recognizable. That there are tropes of epic fantasy becomes incidental. What matters is the story, the characters, and how it all plays out. I think the same is true of Connie Willis' Blackout/All Clear and it is a rare writer that can make you forget the genre in which you are reading, but fall so deeply into a story as to feel as if you've become part of it.<br /><br />5. He dangles the magic just far enough of your reach to make its effect all the more worthwhile. I call this the Superman-effect. Whenever I watch various incarnations of Superman, I am always looking forward to when and how he will use his powers. But in skilled story-telling, it is few and far-between, even though we want to see it more. Martin hints at powers both great and terrible throughout the novel. There are the direwolves, the Stark's have taken. There is something special about them. There was Bran's remarkable dream during his coma. But really, we only see a remarkable display of magic or effect in two places: first when the wight's attack Jon and the Lord Commander in Castle Black on the Wall. And later, at the very end of the novel when the three dragons are born in a remarkable funeral pyre. Such judicious use of magic, sprinkled tantalizingly throughout the novel but coated thickly only twice had a profound effect on me as a reader.<br /><br />6. He spins a remarkable tale. There was not a single point in the book where I thought to myself, this is getting a little slow; I really wish I could skip on and find out about so-and-so. Each time I thought it might happen (usually in scenes from Sansa's point of view) I found to my surprise that I was captured by the story being told, by the subplots unfolding, and by the vast tapestry being laid out before me. More often than not, I had to force myself to stop reading or I would have trouble getting up for work the next morning.<br />He tells a gritty story with an honesty I haven't seen much of in science fiction and fantasy. The grittiness of the world is part of what attracted me to it. These were not tales involving the angelic elves of Rivendell. These were tales of men at war, men who were greedy and rapacious. These were tales of women who were cruel. These were tales of men who strove for honor but didn't always live up to the name. In short these were the tales of ourselves as we really and truly are, not saints, not sinners, but somewhere in that vast purgatory in between. James Morrow in his novel Only Begotten Daughter, as well as in his Godhead Trilogy, is the only one who comes to mind at telling so brutal and honest a tale.<br /><br />7. He isn't afraid to take risks, up to and including killing off major characters. It was one thing to see Sansa's direwolf, Lady, to be killed by Ned at the order of the King. It was quite another to see Eddard Stark beheaded after living his life for 8/10th of the book. It was almost as difficult to see Khal Drogo's demise, sad and pathetic as it was. Or King Robert's for that matter. It was difficult to see Bran paralyzed, Sansa abused by Joffrey, and Arya begging in the streets. Difficult: but that is life. Nothing can be counted on by yourself in this world that Martin has created and for the reader, that means that no one person is special, despite what they might think of themselves. It leaves plenty of room for surprise and emotion.<br /><br />Even the most perfect story can't please everyone 100%. If there were any minor flaws in the story, there are two that I would call to attention:<br /><br />1. I felt that the phrase \\"play this game of thrones\\" was used a little too much. At least, it stood out to me more than any other phrase in the book. Even \\"Winter is coming\\" was tempered and used to elevate the mystery of these long winters. But hearing the phrase \\"game of thrones\\" repeated again and again by the various players didn't ring true to my ears. Once or twice, maybe, but beyond that it felt like the reader was being beat over the head with it.<br /><br />2. I can only imagine the frustration of the reader who read this book hot off the presses-only to find so many loose-ends untied, with the story ending essentially at a climax-and perhaps with no idea when or if there would be a sequel. In my case, at least, I was able to downloadA Clash of Kings to my Kindle the moment I finished reading Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I rarely give out a 5-star review and if you look at novels I've ranked with 5-stars, you'll find that it is a very select class. But Game of Thrones has now joined them.

0596804822|3.0|After completed first chapter, I found that there are some detail key points are missing. It took me some time to figure it out. It is a good book if you have some experiment for iPhone game creation and you want your code to be c++ instead of objective c.
B00008OE4W|5.0|[[ASIN:B00008OE4W Sneakers (Collector's Edition)]]  Hello, Space Fans: I thought I'd clue you in to a little known secret [too many secrets] in the Spy movie genre. It's   a cute little story about a really mixed up group who've been called in to do a spy job for someone in the Govt. that   can't risk being caught. And they ARE MIXED UP! A blind sound man who is so good he can identify frequency tones by ear.   {I toured a radio station once where they had a blind DJ. They had Braile tape marked the commercial cartridges so he   could identify them. He MUST HAVE been GOOD!}      Anyway, (not to give too much away), they had to break-in, get past security, in a toy company office of all things;   to try and find and retrieve a \\"black box\\". Well they found it and got it. Then they find out WHAT THE CHIP IN THE   BLACK BOX WILL DO!! And it becomes obvious why all of a sudden, the police want to kill them, the U.S. Govt. want's   to kill them, and several foreign Govt.s want to kill them too. You will know why too, when you BUY THIS DVD MOVIE   and watch it. It'll become so habit-forming, you'll want to watch it over-and-over again, until you can figure out   all the angles going on at the same time.      Believe me when I say: I know Danny Aykroyd, from when he was filming in Chicago years ago and stayed in my building.   And I've kept in touch with the acting community for years since I started as an extra in \\"The Blues Brothers\\" (also   in Chicago). And I know for a fact that virtually EVERY ACTOR wants to work at least once with Robert Redford, who is   absolutely one of the most generous people I know in the acting community. But also, because I met River Phoenix years   ago when he and his sister Rain (Rainbow) were singing outside the entrance of UCLA to make money to help feed the   family. That was when he was about 10 years old.      Anyway, that's it. I really think you'll LOVE this film!!      I THINK this book, the newest biography on River Phoenix is available here on Amazon.com also.   NEW BOOK AVAILABLE: by author & friend  Barry C. Lawrence, titled: \\"In Search Of RIVER PHOENIX:  The Truth Behind The Myth\\"  [...]                    ISBN:  0967249198       \\"Lonesome George\\" Andrews
0060254920|5.0|This book is more than just a kid's book, it's a family tradition.  I remember reading this book when I was little and loving every second of it, even if I was scared of monsters!  The illustrations are iconic - this book will be a favorite for many, many, many years.      My two-year-old loves this book.  He has one of the monsters as a stuffed toy and makes me read it to him outside over and over again.  This is one of his grandma's favorite books too, so I hope that it can be passed down from generation to generation.    Honestly, I think I get the most enjoyment out of it.  It's not just the childhood memories but I love to read it just to remind myself to not lose that childish side of myself and that bedrooms can still turn into forests no matter how old I get.    I also read this to the kids at the daycare I used to work at.  It's a good book for every age!  The two-year-olds loved the pictures and the four and five-year-olds loved to act it out.    If a friend of mine had never read this book, you can guarantee I would buy it for them in a heartbeat.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|what can i say. i didnt know what to expect with let me in.  i love vampire movies of all kinds.  im even a twilight geek (this movie is not like that just incase your anti twilight or pro twilight, its a horror movie. gory and not the least bit funny or magical).  when abby and her \\"father\\" come in town like a gusty breeze in the night, they have \\"laying it low\\" written all over them.  the neighbor boy in their aparment complex sees them though. hes being brutalized at school by a band of bullies. way past the point of a shove in a hallway. though she fights it abby forms a friendship with the boy and later go steady.  but see abbys not really a girl. shes a blood thirsty vampire who frankly looks like the little girl from the exorcist and turns into a primal blood lusting animal if she doesnt get fed. when shes ok shes a kid tho frankly wants to be a kid.  she knows she cant be. to my that was a hard sadness in the movie.  though your seeing innocent people getting murdered throughout the movie at the same time your constantly reminded that she doesnt like it and that she is very much \\"cursed\\".  another hard part is that most of the people who are killed are teenagers and most of them arent bad people.  just a nother movie to remind me you gotta look in the backseat before you get in the car.  just like the old urban legend. there may be someone back there.

B003Y5HWJU|3.0|Did you enjoy \\"The Sopranos\\" and \\"The Wire\\"? Well this is about half as good. I received the complete set of Wire and couldn't stop watching it. Boardwalk- I kept flipping over to watch something else. In other words - it was faintly tedious. Buscemi is just ok, but I got irritated in the number of scenes opening with him drinking coffee or whisky or champagne or whatever or lighting a cigarette. Too many shots in darkened rooms, too few strong actors amd a slooooow moving plot add up to a lesser HBO product. Not as dreary as Deadwood, but really a C rating only

0307276902|5.0|I really enjoyed A Million Little Pieces; like many people, I could not put it down. But when readers praised it, just to turn around and criticize James Frey's fact-or-fiction account of his drug-riddled past, I can't stand it! A good book is a good book. Period. The only reason most people read it (maybe not most people, but more than would have read it in the first place) was because it was selected as a book-of-the-month pick for Oprah's Book Club. And, along with Oprah, most people are pissed that it wasn't a real memoir, as pinned on the cover. They were duped into believing every \\"fact\\" that was presented in the book. All I have to say is, get over yourself! You loved the book(\\"It was amazing!\\" \\"I couldn't put it down!\\" Yada yada yada) but then decided(again, along with Oprah, surprise surprise) that it was a waste of time(\\"I can't believe I read this piece of garbage!\\" \\"How completely dishonest!\\" and any other negative comments you can think of). But why? It was good when it was a memoir but it's not when you find out it's fiction? Puh-lease! Get over it! Pick up a book that doesn't have Oprah written all over it, read it, and form your own opinion!
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video quality is great, except for just a few scenes, which had some grain.  I would give it a 9 to 9.5 on a 10 point scale.<br /><br />The audio, which is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, is also great.  Lot's of sound coming from all the speakers, including the sub-woofers.<br /><br />I am very happy to have this movie on Blu-Ray.  I am very satisfied with the audio and video quality.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|How can you not like this show.  Not only is Anna Torv amazingly hot, the show is about imaginative as they come, I rate it with X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
B001794FOK|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />It has been a while since I saw this movie, but here is what I remember.

0061743526|5.0|This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest book. I love the story, the writing style, the characters, and the message.  Growing up in rural Georgia, this book had a familiar feeling for me and a big impact on my life. My mother read it to me before I was old enough to read it myself. I read it again at school. I read it again from time to time because I enjoy it so. The message is an important one and valid for any reader. The characters are realistic and familiar, like people you may have known in your own life. A good, good book.
B003ZHR6T8|4.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video quality of this Blu-Ray is really great.  Some scenes looked yellowish.<br /><br />There is supposed to be a Dolby TrueHD 2.0 soundtrack, but when I selected that, my receiver did not say \\"Dolby TrueHD\\".  So, in a way, I feel ripped off, but since it is only 2.0, it doesn't really matter that much to me.  The surround sound my receiver selected sounded okay.  5.1 could have been better.
B004JLDSIC|5.0|I first saw this duo on American tour about two years ago. Along with piano and rhythm, I thought their presentation was one of the best I've seen in decades.    This CD features Stackey Kent in excellent form...voice, phrasing and jazz feel. (I don't know if she gets air play here, but she's one of the best new female talents in years, on a par with Diana Krall.)    I asked her husband Jim, on a break from the concert and hopefully, in a humorous way , if he ever followed Stan Getz. He just smiled and nodded. He's got that Getz sound, when he wants, down to perfection. While listening to his playing, close your eyes and I'll bet you hear some of Getz.    I'm so taken with their music, I must now have everything they've recorded.    Enjoy!
0553131001|5.0|Awsome Book highly recomended for those intrested in reasing fine literature however those weak of heart it truly is a sad story and shows the cruelty of humanity for those in George's positon however I truly recomend the book for anyone

B002KSPKRS|1.0|These are great...when they work. I have had these earphones for over 6 months but have had to stop using them.  They are jsut too damaging to ears. Normal audio is too often uninterrupted by unwanted noise. Loud clicks/pops are frequently generated. Despite the volume settings, these pops are very loud. Worse, they occur no matter how close the headset is to the transmitter station.  If the headphones merely dropped the audio, it wouldn't be so horrible. But the extreme LOUDNESS of the cracks/pops are very painful and damaging to ears.   Save your money and your ears and DO NOT BUY turtle beach products until they fix the crackles!!!
0307272702|5.0|My son gave me Gary Taubes book \\"Why We Get Fat...\\" for Christmas.  I didn't make time to read it until the end of March. I started the recommended foods 4 weeks ago and I have lost 10 pounds and I have not been hungry. This has been the easiest diet plan I have ever been on. I look forward to starting each day with bacon and eggs and it sticks with me -- no need for morning snacks to get through till lunch.  I'm getting some criticism from family and friends for the high fat intake.  However, I am following the advice to talk it over with my physician. I had a blood work up including a cholesterol check, blood pressure & etc before I started the diet.  I will return for follow up analysis as recommended by my physician. I am trying to lose 30 pounds and I am well on my way. If you are overweight, I suggest that you read this book -- at the very least it is something to consider.
0802130208|3.0|Ignatius Reilly is larger than life in many, many ways.  Educated, opinionated to the extreme, possessing a faulty valve - he is quite a unique character, almost a caricature of himself.  John Kennedy Toole weaves an interesting tale that brings to life some particularly unique New Orleans rhythms of life and speech along with a cast of wacky individuals.  I am a big fan of Carl Hiaasen and thought that A Confederacy Of Dunces was a forerunner of his style and casting with some out of this world characters especially ground breaking as it was written in the late 60s.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I never would have fathomed I would enjoy a movie about someone with a speech impediment so much. Although I had heard from numerous people this movie was great, I still nestled into my theater seat with more than a little apprehension and skepticism. I continued to ponder how someone could turn a problem speaking into an enthralling story with enough substance to keep my Gen Y mind entranced for two hours. With the Weinstein Company's past record of movies I should have known this movie was going to be something to look out for. Although they may have had their share of duds over the last few years, they have an uncanny ability to produce critically acclaimed \\"masterpieces\\".    As most people would agree the typical critic fails to seek the same things from a movie as the average viewer does. The Weinstein company has proven their ability to transcend the gap between the \\"average movie goer\\" and the \\"esteemed critic\\". As I watched the King's Speech I could not help but identifying with the struggle of the main protagonist who was flawlessly portrayed by Colin Firth. The director captured the raw emotion of the human struggle in every scene. Even though my personal demons do not lay in my ability to express the spoken word, I could relate to the character.  Firth brilliantly brought to life a character who...   [...]

1416972242|5.0|My Thoughts:  This book was better than City of Bones to me. It had a lot more action in it as the battle with Valentine escalades to an all out war. Then there is Clary and Jace who are obviously in love with each even though they are brother and sister. They fight their attraction to each other because they know they can never love each other in that way since they are related (brother and sister). Yea... I know, it sounds so gross and wrong!!  But that is where Cassandra Clare gets us. She had already built Clary and Jace up to be a couple in the City of Bones and you get the feeling that they should be destined to be together, they were made for each other. She got us attached to them as a couple and now I desperately wish they are some how not related!<br /><br />Poor Simon goes through some changes in this book... a rather big change that will alter his life forever. I love his character and how defensive he gets over Clary, expecially when it come to Jace. You can tell they don't care for each other but they have each others backs when times get hard.<br /><br />I felt the story flowed along well and it keep me reading late into the night...only to leave me with more questions and hopeful answers in the third book in the series, City of Glass. Congratulations Cassandra for another great read.

1416972250|5.0|My Thoughts:<br />Satisfaction! That's what you look for when you invest your time and your emotions in a book. At least that's what I look for. I don't want o spend my time reading a 500 plus page book only to be disappointed in the end. And if I'm going to be disappointed, I want a logically reason why the book should have ended that way, even if the end result isn't what I would have wanted. That might not be how everyone feels...that's just me! City of Glass swept me away. I was in another world. It was more then I hoped for. It had  me laughing with it's quick wit, had me on the edge of my seat. I found myself biting my nails and pulling at my hair yelling, \\"Oh NO! This can't be happening!!\\". At times I was in tears. I was flooded with so many emotions reading this book. I found myself saying, \\"Just one more chapter and I'll go to bed!\\"  I had to restrain myself from flipping to the end because the suspense and wanting to know how it was going to end was just killing me. Though I do not recommend you doing this. It will completely ruin the beauty of the story and its a story that should be read in its entirety.<br /><br />We've heard so much of Idris in The City of Bone and the City of Ashes and now we finally get to see the beauty of it for ourselves. Everyone seems to transform here. The characters are expected of course to grow and change as you progress through a series and these changes were done fantastically.<br /><br />Clay, she's very independent. Despite the fact that she doesn't  know much and Jace is doing everything in his power to keep her away from Idris. She pushes forward and finds her own way there. She refuses to be a bystander or play the victim.<br />Jace, poor Jace. He goes through so much in this book, like he hasn't already been thought enough. Seeing him struggle was so heart breaking. I wanted to reach through the pages and hold him, tell him he'd get through this! His pain felt like my pain and only excellent writing can achieve that kind of emotion.<br />As for the other characters, they too go through a lot. There are changes in store for everyone. Even though there are many challenges to come, they all grow to meet your expectations. There are several huge character developments here and I'm excited to see how these developments will weigh in on the the 4th book in the series, The City of Fallen Angels. Due out April 5th, 2011.<br />Cassandra Clare out did herself on this one. She made a whole soup of emotions in one book. With just one spoonful you'll find yourself laughing, crying, or yelling and sometimes all of these emotions come in just a matter of pages.<br />Tell me, how did you like this book, this series?

The book's weakness is exemplified in the fact that most of what I learned throughout the semester did NOT come from the book. 90% of the content consists of step-by-step exercises, with a \\"Do This\\" approach rather than \\"Do This, Here's Why, and Here's How You Can Vary It\\" which works much better!
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Got this for free on amazon and didn't try it out till today. Such a well made app! Tons of options, great graphics that are fully adjustable and run smooth, and did I mention there's live online multiplayer which works flawlessly? Worth the money.
0316010669|3.0|Malcom Gladwell of course took the world by storm with Tipping Point and had a tremendous effort in Outliers about what makes great people great.  In my opinion, BLINK is only a so-so effort from someone that could produce something much better.<br /><br />Blink discusses how we make snap judgements more than we think we do and how to harness the power of those, but also to beware of those as well.  It discusses the number of different examples of how we do this, but it seems repetitive and redundant.  I didn't really learn anything new in the 2nd half of the book that wasn't presented in the first portion other than that I should beware of these instincts.  So what I am unclear on is, should I trust the instincts or beware of them?  Both?  Depends on the situation?  I guess that can be left up to interpretation.  There are tons of anecdotes which is what Gladwell does well.  Some are very interesting such as New Coke vs. Pepsi and snap judgements we make when we meet different people, etc.  Some are not so interesting such as that when he speaks of military snipers-his point being how it is interesting that in a sequence that is 2.5 seconds, you can describe it for several minutes or more what was going through your head-which I believe is true.<br /><br />There is value with this book-which is essentially in understanding those philosophies above.  I will consistently think of my BLINK instincts and be aware of them whereas before I was not.  I will also remember not to judge things on those BLINK instincts and \\"Thin Slicing\\"-which is easy for all of us to do.  I'm glad I read it-which is why it gets 3 stars-but I can't say it will change your life, but then again Gladwell probably would not say that either.  Was this review too long?  I guess if it was longer than a BLINK maybe I lost you?  Or maybe I didn't?
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This Notepad App is fun and easy to use. I made checklists for our mini-vacation, and it worked so well. I color-coded a packing checklist for each family member.  It was quick and simple to add or edit different lists.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I love this app. It's missing a couple local stations, probably due to legalities. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
B004G600A4|5.0|I'm not too interested in alot of the Pixar/Dreamworks movies. Loved the Toy Stories but other than that most the time they drag on for me. This one was great! My 3 year old daughter has watched it at least 6 times and I myself have watched it twice. I even caught her dad watching it once haha. I liked it so much I loaned it to my friend to watch and told her it was fantastic even if it was a cartoon. You won't be disappointed in this film.
1439108277|5.0|This book reawakens the soul to the wonders of the world, and is a testimony to the power of great teaching - a true masterpiece.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|this cooler is very heavy and tall , have heard reports that the heavy weight may be causing problems with the motherboards mounting lugs ,so far i cannot verify that as i have had zero problems very efficient at cooling . I purchased this to cool my I7 2600K  and no problems since i started using it.  runs WAY cooler than the stock one
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This movie has a lot of action, but it is not in your face. There is enough character development to sympathize with the \\"victims\\", but not so much that it detracts from the action.    Just enough of the 1st movie is brought into this one. It uses some of the same vehicles and concepts. Fortunately, the special effects are clear and accurate. You do not need to have seen the 1st movie to enjoy this one, however it is helpful.
B004EC5IUW|4.0|Eva 2.22 took forever to get to America but was well worth the wait. Rather than discuss the movie I'd rather just review the packaging and Blu-ray quality.    Packaging: Funimation dropped the ball on this one. It looks nothing like the exquisite packaging from 1.11 and does not follow the same motif at all. The Orange slip-cover may look nice in pictures but soon after arrival it will begin to fall apart, as the paint will chip at the slightest of touch. The included booklet of pictures and terms is a nice addition and was well thought-out and executed.    Quality: By far this is the best looking anime out on the market today. Visually the animation is stunning and within 2.22 the creative staff did an excellent job of blending 3D and 2D animation seamlessly. Funimation's transfer is crystal clear and has no major artifacting. The included extras are held to the same standard coming in bright, clean, and in HD. The HD audio mix for both English and Japanese is very well done and there is even an included extra to tell you about the audio mixing difference between the English and Japanese tracks. Audio commentary is included, but rather than discuss the film itself the English director chooses to discuss random topics with the cast. This was interesting but I would have much rather had a commentary about the film.     Overall, I enjoyed the film, Blu-Ray quality, and extras. One star knock off for Funimation dropping the ball on the slip-cover and the inconsistency with 1.11's packaging.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie will increase your faith in God's gift of salvation - Jesus Christ. \\"By His stripes you were healed\\" takes on a new depth and helps you see God's love for you, enabling you to take part in the gifts He gives because He paid such a high price for them. I appreciate Jesus's suffering and resurrection for mankind much more after seeing this movie.
B001AW156U|3.0|These are a wonderful product that work amazingly well.  I am a big fan of the 360 controller, and specifically its shoulder buttons and triggers.  These make the Dualshock 3 controller shoulder buttons a whole lot better.  They really do not add that much height to the shoulder buttons, and they allow for my fingers to stay rooted to it. You can also more easily hit r2 and l2 now with just a quick swipe, instead of having to force your entire finger down to smash down the 2 shoulder triggers, probably a lot of peoples complaint with the DS3 controller is the fact that you have to fully commit to hitting the shoulder buttons which can give you a horrible response time in some games, or your finger just slides right off it. With these triggers you no longer have that issue.    I have two problems with these triggers.  The first is that when hit right the triggers very easily pop off.  If you drop the controller the triggers will literally fly off, and can get lost in little cracks and crevices of rooms.  Also setting it down sometimes, if you do it just right, or wrong depending on how you look at it, you will pop one of them off.  It's not a big issue but if you are clumsy or have kids you may want to try and glue them on, or get extra triggers.    That leads me to my next point of price.  I was very excited when I first saw these on amazon.com, as I love shopping here.  The ease and everything made me maybe rush in and buy these.  The bottom line is they are 2 expensive, and I didn't realize it till they arrived.  I have seen these exact same triggers, they even have a very similar package, at my local Gamestop and Best buy.  They were even the same price, the only difference in price is sales tax.  The reason this upsets me is that the ones I have seen at bestbuy and gamestop are 2 packs.  Which means you get 4 triggers and not 2.  When I saw this on amazon I saw the price, and just assumed that these would be the sames ones I could pick up at gamestop or bestbuy,and that is my problem which is why I haven't tried to return them because I did make a mistake.  I think that they should put how many triggers you get in the description somewhere so this confusion doesn't happen again.  Until they drop their price though I will be buying these locally unfortunately.
B0027G783W|4.0|I broughtthis CD for my beau and we LOVE it. This was my first adventure with Moby and I've purchased Last Night and Play since then......would love to see him in concert one day
B00065MDRW|5.0|I first tried to buy King Crimson thru ITunes. They only offer one song and you have to buy a whole cd of other stuff just to get one song. 9.99 they charge. Well I got the whole album here at amazon.com for a cheaper price. Well worth the cost. Now when I want  hard to find music the first place I check is amazon.com!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I can't get enough of this DVD!  As a fairly new but HUGE fan of Joe Bonamassa I bought the DVD after the Royal Albert Hall CD and both are fabulous.  A must for any Blues/Blues Rock fan.  Smokin' Joe Rocks!
B003UESJF6|5.0|The DVD was exactly as described by the seller and arrived in the time period promised.  Would do business with this seller in the future.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|Paul got his mogo back with this CD.  Best work since Graceland.  Not as upbeat as Graceland, but very reminiscent of his music in the '70's
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The DVD was exactly as described by the seller and arrived in the mail in the time period promised.  Would do business with this seller again in the future.
B000W91RUG|5.0|My real pleasure in this sitcom is watching the interplay between the chief geeks: Leonard, who wants to be normal, and Sheldon, who disdains normality.  Perhaps that's why this show has such a following: many brainy types find themselves torn between wanting to fit into the human race, and having little interest in being ordinary.  I teach at the university level, so I see this basic pattern play out among my colleagues every working day.<br /><br />Leonard has fallen for Penny, the pretty aspiring actress living across the hall.  Sheldon has a very narrow range of interests, in which he continually tries to improve himself, but little concern for anything outside his comfort zone.  Leonard would love to shut off the ideas constantly whizzing around his brain.  Sheldon would love to shut off the world and retreat into those ideas for the rest of his life.  Neither one can have what he wants.<br /><br />These brainiacs attract a huge audience, I contend, because real-life brainy types have both these paradigms at play simultaneously.  I'd love, like Sheldon, to care nothing for sex or approval, and just do what fulfills me.  But I'd also love, like Leonard, to reach outside myself and join the human race as an equal.  Sadly, I can do neither.  So I, and studious geeks worldwide, will sit back and watch these nerds fight that battle for me.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I ordered Country Strong for my daughter- we had seen it in the theater, but it is worth owning. Ordering was a breeze and it was delived before the estimated delivery date.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|On the one hand, I love what they did with this season of the show.  By finally getting Penny and Leonard into a relationship, only to discover they essentially don't speak the same language, they opened up new character avenues where lesser series have shut them down.  And, after focusing on Sheldon and Leonard for two years, the writers finally give some intriguing face-time to Raj and Howard, who no longer have to be the others' wing men.    On the other hand, I appreciated in the prior seasons that the writers didn't rely on \\"situations\\" do carry the episodes' momentum.  This year they have a lot more schtick driving them.  I can almost hear the writers' room discussions: \\"What if we got Leonard and the boys stoned?\\"  \\"You know what we really need?  A flashback episode.\\"  \\"Is there any way we can get Wil Wheaton back for one more episode?\\"    I like plenty from this season.  The rapid swings Leonard and Penny endure show hidden depths in their characters.  Sheldon's extravagant idiosyncrasies continue to provide well-earned laughs.  And the introduction of Melissa Rauch as Bernadette and Mayim Bialik as Amy open up new and promising vistas.  It's just, I'm more interested in remarkable characters than contrived situations.  As long as the creative team remembers that, we should do fine.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I don't want to backup/uninstall/reinstall/reload game data. I just don't care that much. But if you fix it, I'll download it and look at all your pretty ads....
0808519387|1.0|I own both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged in hardcover and paperback.  Since I've recently seen the movie Atlas Shrugged - Part 1, I though it would be a good idea to download The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged on my Kindle.  Well, when I saw the cost to download either book to my Kindle, I decided, no, you really don't want to download those books, not at those outrageous costs.  I would really like to have these books on my kindle but I will NOT pay those ridiculous dollar amounts for the books.  Well, I guess I will just pull the books off my book shelf and read them.
1600108512|5.0|I got a copy of this book through netgalley(dot)com.  I love this story and was excited to see how it was rendered into a graphic novel.  The illustration was absolutely breathtaking and the story fast-paced and engrossing.  Definitely a must for any fans of this story, of unicorns, or of beautiful rendered fantasy graphic novels.<br /><br />Most people are probably familiar with the story.  A beautiful unicorn decides to set out and find whether or not she is actually the last unicorn.  On her journey she finds that her fellow unicorns have been trapped by an evil king.  She goes on a heartbreaking quest to set her people free.<br /><br />I can't say enough how much I loved the illustration throughout this graphic novel.  It was just absolutely stunning.  I always have imagined the unicorn as so beautiful and the illustrators really captured that image and even made it more stunning.<br /><br />The story was exceedingly well told and matched the tone of the illustration perfectly.  Did I mention how much I loved the artwork and illustration?  I got this as an e-galley and will definitely be purchasing a hardback copy to put on my book shelf, just so I can take it out over and over and marvel at the beautiful story and artwork.<br /><br />Overall I am so happy I read this.  If you are a fan of this story or of unicorns or of beautiful graphic novel fantasies this is a must read.
B000BJS4OY|1.0|I ordered this twice and both copies the second disc would not play. I returned both. i have not received my credit back yet.
1883398088|5.0|This book is spectacular, it shows all the artwork he created 4 Alien and he tells abou his experiences everyday that he worked on the film. It saddened me to know that most of his work was not realized in the film, but what do you expect from the Hollywood machine. I got tears in my eyes when his longtime love Mia wrote the last paragraph about him winning the oscar (Acadamy Award) for his work. The Alien films would have never worked out if it wasnt for Gigers work in the first film. It really ticked me off to find out that the studio and film crew treated Giger the way they did. They ripped him off on the first film because he didnt even get a fair mention in the credits which sucks because in my eyes it was his film, not Ridley Scotts. Maybe someday someone will make a film Giger wants to make to the fullest. I Love U Giger you are the greatest artist in my generation no doubt about it.
141690977X|4.0|I can understand why it ws a Best Seller - - - written well, keeps your attention, lots of interesting examples, gives lots of helpful information about how to identify problems and issues in developing relationships.    I disagree with the authors on their recommended \\"speed\\" of dumping a man who does not seem to be all that you want.  Because, you can never get all that you want in a relationship. The authors also don't address the kind of baggage that a woman brings to a potential relationship that she is not aware of, and that causes a man to start to back away from her. Their view is that you should \\"dump the dummy\\" and go find a new man. But, the truth be told, it is not all that easy to go find a new man - - - its takes time, money, and lots of work - - - and you may never find another good mam. Let's face it, there are more than enough overweight and unattractive women out there hunting for the handsome love of their life - - - and sometimes, a woman just has to \\"settle\\" for what she can get, given her own weak physical assets and flawed personality.    It's an entertaining book; it's a helpful book - - but it really applies more to only a small segment of women - - - the younger, more attractive, more physcially fit, alluring, educated, etc. who have no trouble attracting a man, most any kind of man.    But, a better book for reading to help understand how a relationship takes give and take from both sides is Elizabeth Gilbert's book \\"Committed.\\"
B0041KKYCY|2.0|This film was a big let down 4 me, If u are thinking about buying it save ur money and buy the original film which blows the other 1 out of the water period.
B004RC8NUQ|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. If you're in the mood for some boring, obnoxious, pretentious, shallow and tacky white people and their petty problems, this is a movie made just for you. However, if you have some depth and are looking for a movie that's entertaining, has decent acting without an inane plot, look elsewhere. The plot is a non plot and the jokes, non jokes. The dialog is pretentious and sloppily written.  The movie is about a busy woman who gets into a relationship with a man so that they could \\"use each other for sex\\". She predictably falls in love with him and him with her and go on off into the sun set, etc. Yes, this is all there is to it. This is just a sad attempt at movie-making even by today's movie standards. It's like a big unapologetic cliche that drones on forever. I found myself wondering why it was important that these small people, with their small thoughts and small problems should concern anyone. The movie is not worth the 1 dollar Red Box rental fee.
B000XQXD9G|4.0|This is a definite must buy 4 fans of Mario Bava and the italian horror film genre. If iy was not for this film there would have never been a friday the 13th.
B00005Y1TL|4.0|Richard D. James has put together a solid collection of sounds on this release.  On some Aphex Twin releases, it will take a couple of listens before the music sets in.  It's not always instant gratification and some recordings require repeated listens to finally get what the artist is going for.  Personally, I felt that the music jumps out on this.  For example, \\"Xtal\\" is a wonderful opener with these vocals that sounds very ethereal.  It's got this heavenly vibe that is very pleasing to the ears.  My favorite would have to be \\"Ageispolis\\" because the bassline is so playful and the ambience is so fulfilling.  \\"Heliosphan\\" is another gem that gets heavy rotation.  The whole album is excellent, however, there are some parts that drags and doesn't quite hold up.  Overall, this is a great listen and a must for Aphex Twin fans.
B004G6009U|5.0|Thoroughly pleased with the movie - but I preordered thinking I would receive right after it came out.  I ended up purchasing just the dvd it at the local store, since my granddaughter knew the day it was out.  Pre-ordered titles should include express shipping for free so that we don't have to duplicate our purchases.  I ended up keeping the dvd I purchased for my home and she now has the combo.  The combo allows them keep the blu-ray at their house and use the dvd in the car.
B001AQT0UY|5.0|An evil gremlin wanders onto the Deagle estate and reads the sign in front of the house saying, \\"Deeeaggle, Deagle, Deagle, Deagle\\".  The gremlin enters the house and spots a Pepsi can on the kitchen table saying, \\"Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi\\".  The gremlin then makes a move to grab the beverage.  All of a sudden, Mrs. Deagle comes haphazardly into the kitchen and grabs the can without noticing the gremlins presence.  As Mrs. Deagle pops the can open and drinks she heads back to her electric chairlift to elevate to the top floor the Gremlin looks at her with a vengeful scowl on the face thinking, 'it's payback time old hag'.  The gremlin dashes to fuss with the chairlifts wiring system.  As Mrs. Deagle sits on the chair she pushes the button and the circuitry goes haywire launching her at top speed through the window and she hits the ground with both feet in the air.  The camera then shows a pack of gremlins with Pepsi cans in their hands singing fa cha cha cha cha cha with big smiles on their faces.  Pepsi...let's talk about this.
B000001E3V|5.0|Man All i have to say is wow!! Eric Clapton really Wailed on Brownie at the Filmore, i mean come on, the first 2 tracks on the First disc are amazing to see how much passion clapton makes the guitar sound, Wailing and completely awesome. i think i like the live versions of the 2 songs, Got to get better a little while & Why does love have to be so sad more then their studio counterparts since getting and listening to the album, the rest of the 2 discs are great also, just listening to somebody as good as clapton playing with so much emotion and heart that sometimes it brings tears to my eyes, if you love wailing guitar and the Layla Album then by all means get this album!!!
0061726826|4.0|Plot  This development of this novel starts slowly and progresses to a boil at the last quarter of the book. In my opinion, this is not a plot driven novel, but it still works. However, there were a few scenes that felt drawn out to me. I started to skim at several places of this book, more in the first half.     Characters  Lena's voice is incredibly strong, which was my favorite thing about this novel. I found her highly relatable, as well. Oftentimes, the heroines are my favorite books are impressively strong, almost intimidatingly so. Lena's growth makes her human. She displays plenty of flaws, but is still likable. The supporting characters were equally as strong. Lena's best friend, Hana was particularly well-written. I could almost feel her jump off of the page. Alex, the romantic interest, was actually quite likable, which is rare for me.     Writing  The writing is the strong part of Delirium. Oliver writes in a first person, present tense and it is clear she is a master of the English language. She has a very unique way of phrasing things and comes up with unusual comparisons that are so spot on, it's fascinating.     Total Score  This book, in my eyes, it's a 4.5/5. Aside from some of the slower parts, it was an engaging and enjoyable read.
B000H6H81Q|5.0|Excellent Toy.  Substantial in size, my grandson loves this Mammouth.  The tusks might be a little pointy but overall an excellent Mammouth.  Very good detail also.
1594202842|1.0|This book was intriquing for about 5 minutes.  When I was about 35% into it, it hit me that it was nothing more than an arrogant, self-absorbed woman bragging about her ability to enforce her will on her children - almost to the point of child abuse.<br />While a solid education and self-discipline are endorsed by most people I know, there is no proof that the author's unbelievably harsh tactics work better that a balanced approach.  The author is very smug about her approach and criticizes anything \\"western\\".  That her sweet husband would stand by and allow her to inflict this treatment on his children is amazing to me.  But I guess he lets her run the show.  Contrary to what she believes, the show ain't over.
1604680547|5.0|Lovely patterns to inspire quilters, both new quilters and seasoned! Well written with great directions as well as pictures.  Don't get in a rut quilting the same old thing on every quilt...this book will expand your quilting and keep it fresh and interesting.
0920668372|1.0|I made it about halfway through this book with my son before I stopped reading it.  It's disturbing, in a stalker kind of way.  I brought it downstairs for my husband to read, just to make sure that I wasn't reading too much into it, and he threw it away.  It's creepy and unsettling.
0061537969|5.0|I have read a great number of dog related books, and this is, hands down, the best one I've ever read.  Of course, I'm a big time dog lover, but I have given this book to friends who are not dog owners and they love it too.  Enzo is a very believable character. I was fortunate enough to hear Garth Stein speak a couple of years ago, and he relayed how difficult it was to get a publisher to buy a book written from the dog's point of view.  He had several turn him down.  Bet they're sorry now!  Previous reviewer was right to say that this will become a classic.     I do hope this book is not made into a move like the \\"Marley\\" and \\"A Dog Year\\" books.  Some things are best savored in your head via pages...

B004LSO6YI|5.0|Hopefully my review will be published this time.     The first lesbian movie I ever bought was Claire of the Moon..directed by Nicole Conn.  So, when I saw another movie from her, I needed it and wasn't disappointed. I already owned couple of her books .    Well directed movie where the two main characters have that attraction..and think that it's a nonsense.  We can feel the chemistry between the 2 main actresses ( BTW, not their first one together!).    Yes, there's a narration, but this is where we understand the topic, meeting your soulmate!  Payton is fighting her attraction to a straight, married woman..  Not an easy task...when this one is really beautiful, inside out!    Beautiful scenes, music..and kiss.    I've already watched it for a second time and it won't be the last.   Great movie, when you want to have a nice evening , with a positive message about LOVE.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I agree with all of the comments and reviews here.  Nikita was on the cover of a recent TV Guide issue entitled, 7 shows You Need to Watch - and I couldn't agree more.  It is, in my opinion, the BEST show on TV right now.  I just finish watching the season 1 finale and it just knocked me for a loop.  Every episode of Nikita is so well written and satisfying - every fight scene so well choreographed - and the chemistry between Nikita and Michael is so intense. The show has shocked me, thrilled me, gave me \\"OMG\\" moments and kept me waiting to see what would happen next. I will be so sad to see a show of this caliber canceled.  It deserves a solid audience (I believe it has its core fans) and it certainly deserves many more seasons to come.

0312323867|5.0|I did not think I would like this as much as Something Borrowed, but I was wrong. I loved this book. I cried in 2 or 3 different places. The relationship between Darcy and Ethan was sweet if not a bit weird. I loved how Darcy changed and matured through the book. Yes, it is a chick book, but it says a lot about friendship.

I like this dvd so much I have recommended it to several friends who have also enjoyed the workout.  If you want a challenging workout dvd that isn't easy and makes you feel like you are actually working out, purchase the 30 Day Shred.
0345529057|5.0|I just started reading the first book of this series - \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and i'm surprised how well written and adult themed it is.  It's been a great read thus far (i'm only on page 100).    The package appears just as the image would have you believe, 4 paperback books.  Mass paperback edition quality, no worse and no better then a mass paperback you would buy in the store.    I think all the bad reviews are regarding the kindle edition and not the 4 book paperback bundle nor the quality of the writing/story itself.    If you're interested in starting the \\"A song of Ice and Fire\\" saga, pick this up, you won't be disappointed.

B004RE29PO|5.0|This is a review of the Blu-Ray standalone release of Aliens. I'm not sure why they lump reviews for all the different versions together, but I digress...    If you're reading this, you've probably already seen the film. Yes, it's great, and yes, it has aged well.    What I'm focusing this review on in the picture quality and sound. While slightly grainy in a few scenes due to some strange photography decisions by James Cameron, the clarity and sharpness vs. previous releases is flat out amazing. Aliens is a film that has its share of bad transfers (which seem to be the ones that keep ending up on television). Even the DVD version seemed a bit washed out to me. But THIS...is awesome. I rank it up there with \\"Unforgiven\\" in terms of the Blu-Ray \\"seeing it again for the first time\\" factor.     The audio is phenomenal. If you have a surround system, the audio clarity is amazing...beyond what I thought could be possible for a mid-80s film. Ambient sounds, like the rain as the Marines initially approach the settlement, stood out. And the battle scenes will make plaster fall from your ceiling.    Great release. And even better, the fact that both Alien and Aliens are available on Blu-Ray WITHOUT being forced to buy the two followups. It was worth the wait, though I wish they had not imposed that delay on us.
B004S699LI|2.0|I purchased this movie on blu-ray because it was cheap and I never owned the DVD.  As I was opening the package I noticed an unfamiliar name: Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.  If what I saw with this release is indicative of their other releases, do yourself a favor and steer clear.  If you want this movie with a decent quality transfer and NOTHING else, then this may work well for you.  However, know that it really has nothing else going for it.  The disc looks cheaply made and actually has the UPC on it (never seen that one before).  The menu is very minimalistic, just like the rest of the disc.  The only two options are to play the movie and select scenes (the scene selector is painfully slow, by the way).  There are no special features whatsoever (not even a trailer, which was considered pathetic even for a DVD).  There aren't even subtitles or other languages.  And these remain the same two options during movie playback, just play and scene selection.  Plus the menu is so poorly designed that if you hit play again during the movie, where common sense says the movie would pause, it actually starts all over; first taking you back to the unskippable MPAA rating info and Miramax logo.    All in all, it's safe to say that Echo Bridge did not put any effort into this release, and personally I feel if some kid was making a bootleg of this movie, he'd do a better job.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I was expecting a so-so mike for the price, boy was I surprised!  This mike is great.  One thing I did notice was that if it wasn't fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing, other than that it works great.
1400076943|5.0|As with the other book, I ordered this book at the last minute to get to my son in MA for a school assignment.  He received the book on time and was able to complete his assignment which was what we needed.
0066620996|5.0|Book arrived as almost what I would expect from a NEW purchase.  Arrival was right on time -- couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Will continue to buy used books confidently thru Amazon.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|I first watched this in a Spanish film class in college and fell in love with it.  I am a native English speaker with Spanish as my second language.  Even if you can't speak Spanish, the storyline is easy to follow, and dramatic at times but funny at others (and there are subtitles).   Great.
0525422943|4.0|If I Stay was such a remarkable book, because while the idea was simple. It was developed in such a stunning way that it makes you think about what you would choose. I was so excited for Where She Went when I heard about it. Gayle Forman has such a remarkable way with words and that is part of the reason that I was so excited. The other being that I love these characters. Mia reminded me so much of myself and it was amazing to see how different she was three years later. Adam was amazing. I could feel how heartbroken he was after Mia left him and also found insight into the haunting lyrics that began each chapter. The chapters alternate between the past and the present of Adam and Mia. The glimpse into what happened made me keep on guessing what exactly went wrong. Though their chemistry shines through out the book, and I couldn't question how much they cared for each other. The writing was so raw and emotional that I felt it the whole time. I couldn't stop crying and laughing at times. Where She Went has the same gripping necessitous that If I Stay had. I couldn't stop reading this book.I highly suggest that you read this book as soon as possible. It is a must for anyone that loved If I Stay.
B0036T31YY|5.0|I can't believe that I've never heard of this movie before.  I just happened to come across it looking for a movie to watch that was free with my Prime membership, and I noticed that it looked like it had gotten some good reviews.  The movie isn't perfect, and if you think about it too hard you might have smoke pouring out of your ears, but it's really freakin entertaining.  And Melissa George is phenomenal.  She really goes for it and doesn't hold anything back.  It's not often that someone that beautiful is also a great actress, and I don't know why she isn't more well-known than she is.  But I'm sure she's got a long career ahead of her, if we're lucky.<br /><br />I am really a sucker for these kind of movies.  I would place this is in the same category as The Machinist, Eternal Sunshine, Memento, and Mulholland Drive.  I won't say much more than that because, in my opinion, absolutely anything I would say to try to describe it would be a spoiler.  You really need to just press play and pay attention.  You want to experience the movie as it happens, and not have any pre-conceived notions about what it's about or what's gonna happen.  And I personally hate it when I read a review that practically ruins the movie by giving too much away.  Films are meant to be discovered as the story unfolds.  You should know as little as possible going in.
1416972242|5.0|I recently reread this series and decided to review it, since I haven't. I love this series. It is definitely what I would recommend to anyone that is just starting to read young adult, because it has such rich and developed characters, an exciting plot, and writing that is perfected. Clary is a sweet girl that is trying to do the right thing, which other then trying to wake up her mom and other then that, she isn't really sure what to. She thinks she loves Jace, but he is her brother and that is wrong. Jace is very cocky and sarcastic, but you can't help loving him. Especially when you see Clary and him interact and a total other side of him emerges out of no where. He also wants to protect the people he loves more then anything and he knows that his father is the cause of it. Simon is sweet and I can't help adoring him. His geekiness is really cute and his devotion to Clary is well awesome. Isabelle is a kick ass female character that you adore, even though she can be frightening at times. Alec is unsure or who he is and how that fits into his life. I found his relationship with Magnus to be adorable.<br />The plot of this book keeps you excited from the first word to the last. Every moment in this book is full of action, suspense, or magic. The originality of this book is awesome. I love how it is based on mythology and is so unique. Clare's writing captures your imagination and makes it run while. Even when I was rereading this, I couldn't wait to start the next book right away. You have to read this series, it is definitely one of my favorites.
0143116738|5.0|I loved this book. It helped me to be more confident in my abilities and unique talents and worry less about areas in which I've always considered myself weak. In fact, I bought copies for each of my three kids since they have more time to benefit from its lessons. This is a great book for anyone trying to figure out what they want to do with their life.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family.  My 10 year old loves it as much as my 3 year old.  It has some beautiful animation.  I wish more movies were made like this that the whole family could enjoy together.  There are a few parts that could be scary for little ones, but mine seemed to be fine.
0345472322|5.0|Do you have a fixed-mindset or a growth-mindset? This is a simple question but understanding and being able to change from fixed to growth mindset is truly life-changing - and that's what this book does. There are plenty of books out there on \\"quick fixes\\" and personality development, but radical and genuine changes can only be brought about by changing the deeply held beliefs about intellect and mind. For fixed-mindsets, it is always about putting a façade and proving themselves superiors by masking their shortcomings. For growth-mindsets, it is all about learning and growing. Growth-mindset people are students of life and deeply believe that their abilities are not limited.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a great cooler. It dropped my CPU temps by 10 degrees C with a 35% overclock. Just make sure you have enough room in your case for it to fit. Mine is in a HAF 912 mid-tower. One thing that I really like about it is it comes with an extra mount and pads to install a second fan later if you want to.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|Used and in fantastic mint condition. the seller kept their word. i recommend this product to anyone with a sense of great music. thanks again
075640407X|5.0|The Name of the Wind is the first in Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles series and it is a fantastic series opener. The book itself is a doorstop at 660 pages but it took me less time to read it than it has many books half its size. It's a quick moving story with a great cast of characters and it has the depth that I'm starting to appreciate with epic fantasy.    It's the story of a man named Kvothe, whose parents are members of a troupe of magicians, storytellers, and other types of entertainers who travel from city to city. Kvothe is a prodigy of sorts. He's just a young boy as he begins telling his story, but he's advanced for his years. He's quick to learn and has an insatiable appetite for knowledge. One evening, after Kvothe had been wandering around as his parents prepared dinner, he returns to find his parents and everyone else in their troupe murdered. He has a brief encounter with their killers and comes to believe that they are the Chandrian - a group previously believed to exist only in myths and legends.    So begins Kvothe's quest - to discover the truth behind the legends and gain the skills he'd need to avenge his parents' deaths. His journey takes him from the life of a street urchin, fighting daily for his survival, to that of the youngest student ever to be accepted at the University - a Hogwarts-esqe type of school that teaches those who attend the power behind the names things are given. The book ends after just one day of Kvothe telling his tale to a scribe, day two picks up with The Wise Man's Fear, which is on my bookshelf right now. We'll see how long I can hold out before picking it up. My goal is to wait until publication of the third book has been announced.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|1 Star for taking THE all time classic and adding in cartoons!  I love special editions that let me choose to see deleted/extended scenes, Avatar being a good example; they gave you the option to watch the original opening scene (that wasn't as good as the theatrical release) but made sure you could still watch the theatrical version....    This debate only became clear to me when I finally saw the original on vhs again about 5 yrs ago -- it was night and day how the emotional impact hit home ----somehow all the cartoons and extended scenes managed to take away from that impact and distract, rather than enhance.    5 Stars for the titled product \\"Star Wars: The Original Trilogy\\", which this certainly is not.
0425241505|4.0|It was so nice to take a break from the vampires and werewolves and read about dragons. This was a great paranormal romance about Pia, a half human half Wyr and Dragos, an ancient Dragon Lord.  The first half of this book was action packed as Pia is on the run from Dragos after stealing from his hoard.  Once Dragos catches up to her the sparks fly.  The second half of the book you get to meet Dragos's crew and watch Pia and Dragos grow closer.  Dragon Bound has action, magic, romance, adventure, characters you can cheer for and a few twists that make you smile.  I will be adding Thea Harrison to my list of must read authors.
B004XWLN20|5.0|The finale really sucked, and really deflated what was an outstanding season 10. The cheesy CGI graphics of Kent saving Air Force One was the biggest LOL moment of the series, and it wasn't meant to be funny.  I enjoyed every season on Smallville except for season 7, but the show quickly bounced back for some of it's best episodes ever in season 8.  I plan on purchasing this set, as I am huge fan of the genre.   The episodes featuring Christopher Reeve are forever special, as they showed the strength of that man and his fight for life.   Kristin Kreuk was not missed, but Rosenbaum was. It was great to see him there at the end.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|It's good that they got rid of the ads while you're playing. However, the Bing ad is still there when you lose and when you pause there is still an ad. Just because they try to sneak the Bing ad into the UI doesn't mean it isn't an ad. It makes it even worse. It wasn't there when I first installed this game for free. I was hoping it would go away with this &quot;ad free&quot; version. This is false advertising.
B004RJZA1E|4.0|This is metal with something for everyone.  Excellently produced, heavy but not too heavy, gruff vocals, soaring clean vocals, poppy but still powerful female vocals, cool Nordic synths...what's not to love?  This album is definitely geared towards mainstream attention and won't satisfy die-hard extreme metal fans, but it's beefy and ballsy enough to get every head a-bangin'.<br /><br />Riding the wave of super-polished, precision crafted Scandanavian pop metal (which is very different from American pop metal), Amaranthe sound like a smooth blend of Nightwish, Scar Symmetry, and Sonic Syndicate.  The metalcore aspect of their sound is thankfully minimal, instead leaning more towards power metal.  There are hooks in abundance, and the pop influence is very noticeable in the choruses, but they pull it off with stellar results.  The sound is massive and highly energetic, and doesn't sound whiny or emo at all.  Metal can hang with the pop crowd, and Amaranthe dominates.
0385486804|3.0|I agree with other reviewers who have said that Krakauer didn't have enough content to write an entire book on McCandless. A lot of information is repeated, and 2 chapters are about the author himself. I was annoyed reading those chapters, and if not for my obsessiveness about completing books I would have skipped them altogether. All things considered it was an enjoyable and quick read.
0316066524|1.0|I had to give at least one star despite it being about as involving as counting grains of sand.  Academic intellectuals praise it because it does have a wordy cleverness but, as I asked a writing teacher at Pomona College - where I believe Wallace taught, 'Why is a piece of writing is better simply because it's full of inside references that only a few academics understand?\\"  There are a few sections that show a bit of story telling, but about 950 other pages of sleep inducing nonsense.  Academics also praise it as a badge of courage for (allegedly) reading it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was amazing.....and the ending blew me away. Everyone that I have recommended it to has had the same reaction at the end. Just amazing....I don't know if he will be able to keep up the great work in his books to follow but I hope so. I would put this up in the realm  of Sarah's key, The guernsey Potato Peel Society, all of which were just wonderful to read. I love a book that has such an inspirational ending.
0385342055|5.0|Listen, don't listen to the negative reviews. I read the entire book and was laughing out loud and entertained the whole way. The whole Shopaholic series is warm and hilarious and Sophie's newest addition is an absoulute pleasure to read. Its also fun to see the wicked Eleanor take a sudden interest in her grandchild and her sad and strange attempts to forge a bond. I can't wait for the next in this series. Always a treat.
0670022411|4.0|A great read.  Was just a little disappointed that I have to wait for the other two books, Wasn't aware that it was book one of a trilogy.  Looking forward to the next two books!
B0046MVVOW|5.0|Worth every penny.  I knew my wife wanted a Kesha CD but not knowing for sure what songs she liked, I got her this Deluxe Edition and she was more than happy with it.
1439152780|5.0|VERY good book. Can't put it down.  I read the Forgotten Garden first and fell in love with it, so I had to try her other books.  This is extremely similar in style and character and a blast to read.  I love the suspense she puts on the story and how when you think you have it figured out, you're wrong.  Mysteries have always intrigued me and I love that she works children's stories into the mix. And of course, fairy tales are always fun.  Very good job of working children's stories into an adult's novel.  Everyone really is young at heart.  She ties the beginning into the end very well.  I like to completely immerse myself into good books and Kate Morton has just been added to that collection.  I ABSOLUTELY recommend this book!  I already recommended Forgotten Garden to many friends and I can't wait to let them know about this one!
0307237699|1.0|Not being a fan of this clown, I thought, 'What the heck, it ought to be good for laughs.  Full of lies, bent truths.  Don't waste your money.  Instead, send the money to the charity of your choice!
1604680547|5.0|501 Quilting Motifs:  Designs for Hand or Machine Quilting is an excellent book for quilters.  The book was received in perfect condition and before the expected time listed on my order, thanks to careful and prompt handling by the seller.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|This was an excellent book on simple neuroanatomy and the slow recovery from a stroke.  Although probably the author could not recall exactly what she went through...it's close enough! Great book!
0977326403|4.0|A MUST READ for anyone working with or for social organizations.<br /><br />Key take-aways:<br />- Define inputs separate from outputs<br />- Define what success looks like and then identify different ways to know when success has been achieved<br />- Don't be afraid to pick messy measures, pick what you can and build the indisputable case.
0316056863|4.0|I bought the book out of curiosity to learn more about Tina Fey.  I was amazed that this woman has done so much already.  Also she has some funny stories about motherhood which made the book so so funny! The book's chatty style seems like it is a series of conversations with Ms. Fey.  I highly recommend it to those who think that biographies are dull.  Lots of stories, lots of chuckles......
055357342X|5.0|I'm almost out of breath after completing George RR Martin's \\"Storm of Swords\\", the third in his Fire and Ice series. Each chapter is like its own short story with its own little cliffhanger. Martin's characters are dramatic, melodramatic, genuine, realistic, and so bold and colorfully drawn that I find myself thinking about them in between readings. After each book I've needed to take a little breather, but find myself drawn back to the stories and the characters' individual and interconnected dramas, desperate to find out what's happened next, while enjoying the immersion in Martin's world.    While some of Martin's characters are clear 'black hats', and some are 'white'...there's more 'gray' than anything else, which adds to the realism of the ever-changing qualities that the characters display. Some of the black hats start moving toward white, and some of the white drift towards the black. Like real life, few of Martin's story lines have true endings. Even when a character is killed, the ramifications are often far reaching and impact Martin's landscape across multiple books in the series.     One couldn't really get their arms around 'Storm of Swords' without having the background of the previous two books. The author doesn't pander to one looking for detailed background and reminders. He relies on the memories of the reader to connect the dots until Martin's good and ready to connect them outright.    This is the first book in the series that really takes a full leap into fantasy, whereas the first two were more medieval historical novels set in an otherworldly location. Martin introduces some of the evil that's been threatening from the north - Giants, Mammoths, Shadowcats, and the living dead. There's a sprinkle of magic from Melisandre and her Lord of the Light. And oh yeah, and the three dragons with their mother Daenerys, are threatening Westeros from the East.    What drives this series are the characters and storylines. And there are a lot of each. Martin chews through pages like a direwolf through a deer, but things are never dull, and the storylines never dry up. The final 300+ pages absolutely fly by. I'm not a fantasy reader. But I love this series. And book three is as solid, deep and satisfying as the previous two.
1439153663|4.0|The Kitchen House opens in late 18th century Virginia.  Young Lavinia is orphaned during her crossing from Ireland to America, and the capitain of the ship takes her as an indentured servant to pay for her crossing.  The cautious Lavinia is placed with the Capitain's house slaves in the Kitchen House on his plantation in Virginia.  Thanks to her kindness to the Mistress of the House, Lavinia is eventually welcomed into the house.  Will the opportunities of the big house help Lavinia, or will they hurt her and the family she has grown amongst the slaves in the Kitchen House.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story told in the Kitchen House and how it examines slavery from the unique perspective of a girl who is not quite a slave but not quite a free white woman either.  Since Lavinia has no family and is an outsider to American culture, she gives an assessment of the situation that she finds herself in that is not colored by American society.  I think it's this objectivness that lets her stradle both worlds, and ultimately try to move between them.  I enjoyed how the author used Belle, a kitchen slave, to moderate and balance Lavinia's telling of the story.  The scope of the novel was also very interesting, since it covers a fairly long period from Lavinia's childhood through her early adulthood.<br /><br />Fans of historical fiction should check out this interesting novel.
0345529057|1.0|I love my Kindle, and almost a third of the way through the Martin series, I really like \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\". However, I do not like the book series enough to pay almost twice as much for the ebook edition. Someone really needs to have a word with the publisher. I would much rather save the shelf space and the trees and buy the Kindle edition but not at almost twice the price.     I guess you can add my voice to the group who love the series but hate the price gouging.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This video arrived just in time to be a special gift from the Easter Bunny. My son loves this movie, and the family enjoys watching it together. The seller was prompt and I would purchase from them again.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This book was so refreshing! It has been a while since I have picked up a book and have genuinely not wanted to put it down. I loved so much about this book but I won't go into details because I don't want to spoil anything. I will say that this was very well written. The main character, Anna, is such a fun, intriguing, and well written character. I found myself laughing out loud at some of her witty comments. I just found her very endearing. She also had interesting friends and of course an interesting (and complicated) love life. This is a book that I can see myself reading over and over again just when I need a pick me up or a fun, light read. I also love the idea of living in another country so that aspect of the story really kept me enthralled and the details really made you feel like you were in Paris. I would highly recommend this book. I was very impressed with this new author, Stephanie Perkins, because she writes relationships, friendships and romantic, so well and real that you really respect this book for its genuine nature. Read this book, you wont be disappointed.
B004HO6HWK|2.0|Ya - this sucked.  Gave it two stars cause near the middle it actually got a little fun.  Statham should be in contest with Seagal to see who can keep their words under three syllables.  Script sucked, plot sucked, pacing sucked.  It was like a bunch of bad edits mashed together to fill in an hour and a half.    Also, this wasn't violent for those who like some blood and guts.      Meh - go watch some silly fun like The Expendables or Rambo instead.
B004ZP37ZQ|5.0|Download was fast and picture quality was superb. Wathced the episode by linking my laptop to tv and was in heaven! Now power outages, weather gliches and kids cannot keep me away from watching current episodes! A++
B004XCUEU2|5.0|Just from seeing an obviously edited TV broadcast...I was so moved! The DVD release is 135mins. Plus I am sure bonus surprises! The Foo's are at the pinnacle now! The band is so tight and \\"Wasted Light\\" is amazing. What's even more amazing is \\"Back And Forth\\". A seemingly quiet history...no tales told...well here it is! I was amazed what Dave has been through in 16 years! That just since his release of the debut album done by Dave on his own! A genius of the 21st Century. Hell a genius period! The story behind Dave branching his demos into a full fledged band did not come without some major speed bumps. Firing band members for the greater good. Member(s) leaving, then coming back to the fold. Bring all up to date to the incredible band that Foo Fighter's are today: Taylor, Chris, Nate, Pat & Dave. Foo Fighter's forever!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved it... hate cliff hangers, but had the third book on the shelf, so it was like reading one very long book. I'm going to miss Salander.
0140277447|5.0|For the 110 1-star reviewers, well if it makes you sleep better at night deceiving yourselves this didn't happen, well so be it.  For the rest of us righteous people, we needed to know this indeed did happen and like Hemingway once said, the world is a \\"fine\\" place worth fighting for.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|As a huge Superman fan and a blu-ray enthusiast, I have been waiting for this collection for a long time. I have been putting off buying single movie editions of these films because I knew this set had to be coming, and for someone like me that is pretty difficult. Not only does set come with all the movies, it also comes with Superman and the Mole Men, all the classic Max Fleischer cartoons, and loads of special features. I'm glad I painstakingly waited this anthology collection!
B00000JBFW|5.0|THE BEST MUSIC EVER CAME OUT OF THIS ERA, THIS CD JUST PROVES MY POINT. THE TITLE SONG PERFECT STRANGERS SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD ENOUGH TO BLOW YOUR  SPEAKERS...JUST LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS....WHERE'S MY 'WAY BACK' MACHINE TO GO BACK AND SEE THESE GROUPS LIVE AGAIN......
B003VR5PPY|5.0|When i read that this game was coming out soon; i was pumped. I actually got this from a game store; and when i went to purchase it, the lady at the register told me it was fun but way too much text to read during the game. But when i got it home and started playing it, i understood what she meant by it being heavy on the text, but it was no where near as bad as she made it out to be. The story is very well written and intense. (I played it with earbuds in so i could get more immersed in the game) It's also dramatic and funny without coming off as cheesy. I could not put it down and ended up finished it in the early hours of the next day. It's a great interactive story and i doubt you'll ever get bored; considering that it has multiple endings. So if you have someone tell you that there is way too much reading in the game, don't let it discourage you. Give it a try first and see for yourself!
1904920233|5.0|Looked at this book from a friend and decided I had to have it.  It's excellent for the oriental sauces one can prepare, keep in the fridge and use for a variety of preparations. It's clear, non fussy and effective.
B004K4IZ3G|1.0|I watched this for about 10-15 minutes and turned it off.  The narrative flow was irritating and broke the flow of the tale.  I'm not really sorry I didn't stick around for the special effects as I expect a minimum story quality to the movie.  Fail.  WHEN WATCHED: today; MY GRADE: D plus to C minus.
B004UID2LC|3.0|i really wanted to use this application, but why does a youtube download app need access to my phone state, phone numbers of who i'm talking to, etc. Does anyone know why this would be needed?
B004TE6F66|4.0|OMGOODNESS! This sequel was really good. I could not put this one down. I thought the pacing with this one was alot better than the 1st book but I find that I love both stories equally the same. What I wasn't 2 fond of was Isabel. I didn't like her in the 1st book & I wasn't happy about her getting more page time in this one. She was still just as irritating, selfish & self centered as ever. And although I felt for her because of the loss of her brother Jack in book 1, she still failed to redeem herself in my eyes with her \\"dealing\\" with Jack's death in this book. Yes, she helped out. Albeit reluctantly, but she helped. Yes she told the cold hard truth when no one else wanted to face the facts. But this still didn't change my view of who she is 2 the core.<br /><br />Cole. I was a bit concerned how he was going to fit into this world, and I think he was woven in superbly. There is a huge surface factor u have to get past where Cole is concerned before u start to care or want to care what happens to him. I think the layers that begin to be pulled back to reveal Cole's true nature, his heart, was executed beautifully. And there is much more I believe we will get to see in the final book about him.. There were so many heartbreaking & flat out gut twisting scenes in this book. I loved it.<br /><br />I also loved & hated the fact that now, after all these years & especially during this time, that Grace's parents decided it's time to start acting like parents. This dynamic I understood from both sides which is why I loved & hated it. What I mean is her parents choosing to take a stand and try 2 keep Grace from the one love in her life that in so many ways literally could mean life or death to her, & try to replace it with theirs which has been absent for majority of her life. It's sad because in Grace's eyes it's 2 little 2 late. And what she needs they could not possibly begin to understand. Their ignorance to these facts could quite literally kill her.<br /><br />And of course the LOVE we witness between Grace & Sam still all the more beautiful than the 1st time we were introduced to it. U saw these 2 grow individually. And I felt for Sam. His dealing with being human and having to deal and face the responsibilities passed down to him as far as the pack is concerned. Him loving his life now but still being very much apart of his pack family because they need him, while @ the same time being set apart from it cuz all he wants is a normal life to be free to live & love Grace. But he misses his pack. Not the pack way of life, but the ones he shared that life with. It was heartbreaking. I really love this series so far and I cannot wait to read the conclusion to this series. I highly recommend u read both books!itness between Grace & Sam still all the more beautiful than the 1st time we were introduced to it. U saw these 2 grow individually. And I felt for Sam. His dealing with being human and having to deal and face the responsibilities passed down to him as far as the pack is concerned. Him loving his life now but still being very much apart of his pack family because they need him, while @ the same time being set apart from it cuz all he wants is a normal life to be free to live & love Grace. But he misses his pack. Not the pack way of life, but the ones he shared that life with. It was heartbreaking. I really love this series so far and I cannot wait to read the conclusion to this series. I highly recommend u read both books!
0821221841|5.0|Ansel Adams is no longer corporeally walking the earth, calculating exposures and producing photographic visions.  But his legacy, his works and his writings live on.  And indeed, the Big A was a master of his craft and his written legacy still holds value even in the face of changing technology.  Digital cameras have remapped much regarding how photography is done and at Universities, wet photography has been almost entirely dropped from curriculums in favor of digital media technologies.  The question might for some be, is what the Big A wrote, still applicable?  Yes it is.<br /><br />First, wet photography has not been totally eliminated. It may be argued that there are certain photographic results which cannot be obtained by digital photography that the film camera was capable of.  Perhaps.  But undoubtedly, obtaining a first hand and masterful knowledge of photography, digital or wet, and in particular what was done to conceive good end images, and technologically achieve those results as Ansel did, is applicable today.  It's just done differently. What does not yet exist, is a good masterful book, such as Ansel's, which goes into the detail and breadth to explain how to achieve those similar results with digital media.<br /><br />To that end, I highly recommend Ansel Adams' book series as an intellectual stimulant which every photographer should digest wholly. Afterwards, the digital means to achieving the same levels of image fidelity and adjustments, still based on the zone system, will be at least suggested. Digital photographers exposed to Ansel's views on his craft will then find stimulus to fill in the blanks when attempting similar fidelity and adjustments with digitally obtained photographs.

B002M3SP28|5.0|This is such a good read. I think it is Jeffrey Archer's first historical novel about Mallory, an Englishman who made several attempts to climb Mount Everest in the 30's and lost his life on the mountain. His body was not discovered until 1999.Jeffery Archer offers the very plausable theory that Sir Edmund Hillary may not have been the first man to reach the summit of Everest.

B003Y5H54W|1.0|If it was possible to give negative stars, I would.  Thornhill's review of this \\"movie\\" is much more entertaining than the movie itself.  Colossal waste of time.  And Gary Oldman must be writhing in embarrassment that he was a part of this project.  No plot, no dialog, no sense.

B001EAWMGA|3.0|I'm not going into great detail here, as other reviewers have already done so.  The movie is good, the acting is good.  The special effects hold up well.  The mix of sci-fi and viking elements work well together.  Are you seeing a trend here?  Everything is just \\"ok\\", but that's a good thing, as nothing was horrible, though nothing jumped out at me as extraordinarily unique.  Its well worth your money to purchase and the time to watch this movie, even if the pacing is a tad slow.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|Around the age of 25 men start to look at their life and start wondering where they stand. Comparisons come with other people of their age and with their parents at that age. Children, work, still studying, it's all different but you can't help comparing. Robin Pecknold is like all of us, realizing in the first line of the new album \\"Helplessness Blues\\" that his parents already had a kid. He is just back with his girlfriend and finally released the long awaited follow-up to the eponymous debut.     The beautiful title track explains a lot of his thinking of his place in the world, as a `cog'. A song with questions that everyone has at one point in their life. Who am I and what is that world outside really like. Realization comes in `Lorelai': \\"so, guess I got old, I was like trash on the sidewalk\\". \\"Helplessness Blues\\" is an album with more questions than clearcut answers, or as Pecknold sings in `Blue Spotted Tail': \\"Why is life made only for to end?\\".    Musically the album gives us nothing new. Expanding on the sound of the debut along the lines of all the great westcoast folkies from the 60's and 70's: Byrds, Beach Boys (the opening bars of `Lorelai', Neil Young etc. The focus is on his vocals, harmony background vocals and acoustic instruments. While lacking the radio \\"hits\\" it features some future classics in \\"Battery Kinzie\\", the title track and \\"Someone You'd Amire\\" which should be able to silence a crowd of 80.000. The sound worked on the first one, it does so again on the second.    The real strides have been taken in Pecknold's songwriting. \\"Helplessness Blues\\" is a much more personal and mature record that for people in the same age group might be at times confronting but also rewarding. So I wasn't alone when I thought those things that spun around in my head.     I was still mucking about at university at the age Pecknold and his Fleet Foxes made an impressive second album. Best album of 2011 so far. It's been worth the wait and questions.  (from the Wide Eyed Explorer)
B00393C47M|5.0|Coraline Jones isn't thrilled when her parents move her into an apartment in an old Victorian house. Her neighbors, two elderly women named Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, and an eccentric old man, Mr. Bobo, don't help her to feel at home either. Coraline's parents don't pay her much attention, so she spends most of her time exploring the creepy old house. One day, she discovers a small door in the wall that has been bricked up. Despite warnings from her neighbors that she is in danger, Coraline decides to explore the door further when she is alone. She soon discovers that the bricks are gone, and instead, a passageway is on the other side of the door leading to an apartment that is identical to her own. Living in the other apartment are her Other Mother and Other Father, also identical copies of her own parents but with buttons for eyes. Coraline learns that this Other World is far more interesting than her own, and spends more and more time there, becoming closer with her Other Mother and Other Father. One day, her Other Mother offers to let Coraline live in the Other World forever. Coraline considers the idea, until she learns that in order to stay she will have to have buttons sewn on her eyes. Coraline quickly escapes the Other World, only to discover that her real parents are missing. Has her Other Mother trapped them in the Other World?<br /><br />This novel, adapted into the hit 3D film of the same title, is a truly creepy but engrossing story that will spook even the bravest of young readers. Almost from the beginning of the story, it's clear that something unearthly is in store for Coraline. The house she's moved to is creepy, and when she discovers the Other World, things get even more suspicious. Although the Other World is, at first, delightful, something isn't quite right. Why do her Other Mother and Other Father have buttons for eyes? Why does the Other Mother seem so urgent to have Coraline agree to live in the Other World forever? After Coraline's parents are kidnapped and she must rescue them, things get even creepier. Several scenes when the Other World is beginning to unravel into the horrifying place it is are truly eerie, even for adult readers. `Tweens will delight in the scariness of Coraline's predicament, however, particularly since it does turn out well in the end. Gaiman does a truly remarkable job of creating an unusual and entertaining story for all ages to enjoy. Coraline is likely to be a classic for years to come.<br /><br />As a big fan of the movie, I was really interested in reading the book version of Coraline. I was not disappointed! Like the film, the story is just eerie enough to be enjoyable. I really enjoyed the drawings by Dave Mckean that accompanied the text. They added an element of creepiness to the story, even though I had visions of the film while reading it. I would highly recommend this novel to `tweens searching for something fun to read under the covers at night. An instant classic<br /><br />Like my review?

B003EYVXTG|3.0|Winter's Bone, an adaptation of Daniel Woodrell's 2006 novel of the same name, is about the ravages of meth in rural communities of America. Although this is a very depressing subject, ultimately this is a movie about hope and strength, a story of a kid's transformation from a girl to a woman, when she has to fend for her siblings as their father abandons them. This is a good story and has been directed well but after a few days after having seen the movie, the performance of the lead Jennifer Lawrence lingers forever.
0670022411|1.0|This was one of the worst books I've read in a long time and feel duped by the author and publishers.  First let me say, this is not a novel to be even remotely compared to the masterfully told tales of Harry Potter.  The book was reviewed on NPR and summed up as a \\"Harry Potter for grown ups.\\"  As a result, I thought the book would be cleverly written with a unique take on witches and magic.  Instead, this book turned out to be a novel mostly about a brooding vampire (the hero) and an incredibly silly witch (the heroine).  This book is nothing more than a romance novel and a poorly constructed one at that.  The first few chapters were interesting and full of promise when the book actually seemed to be about a witch who does not use her magic.  The heroine, Diana, had spunk, she was charming (excuse the pun), and intelligent.  Matthew, the vampire, had an interesting story to tell also, at first.  Once they fell in love, the author wrote the character of Matthew as way too over the top in his protectiveness of Diana.  Page after page he's telling her to eat, sleep, drink, rest, lie down, take a bath, rest, sleep, eat some more, drink.  He even carries her around the way one would carry a toy poodle.  She's remarkably weak and tired ALL THE TIME.  Diana practices a spell and then all of sudden, she's weak and shaky, needing Matthew to carry her to bed so that she can sleep for the rest of the day.  This book takes way too long to get to the point, the author describes every minute detail of the scenery, what Diana is eating, what Diana is wearing, the smells.  Jeesh.  Every page seemed to have some detail about the scent of Diana or Matthew's cinnamon and cloves scent.  The creepiest descriptions were of the witch and vampire kisses.  Her warm lips up against his cold lips.  Gross. Let me finally add that after the first half or so of the book, the author seems to forget the original idea and goes in a few other directions.  I know this is a book about magic but it becomes unrealistic when we learn that Diana possesses all the truly enviable magical gifts and that her 1500 year old boyfriend/vampire was best friends with nearly every great political figure, scientist, pope, etc.  If he'd been born earlier I'm sure Jesus Christ would have been a close  personal friend.  I could go on and on about this boring, pretentious book but I'll stop here.  Needless to say, I don't recommend it to anyone.
B003Y5H50G|5.0|The character, that is, not the actor.  I've never dreamed of dating Renee Zellweger.<br /><br />Regarding the film: it's a very rare commodity in Hollywood these days.  No ecological warnings, no CGI, no dismal theme.  It's simply a very good story told in a masterful fashion.  The lead character is a writer in NYC.  He is intelligent and very talented, but struggles with a number of personal demons.  As a result he lives in virtual poverty and his long-suffering girlfriend is ready to dump him.<br /><br />Then he's given a cutting edge drug by a \\"friend\\" that is supposed to increase cognitive functioning.  He takes it on a whim and as a result his life turns around totally.  He finishes a brilliant novel in record time, earns a fortune in the stock market, and makes the acquaintance of a number of beautiful and wealthy people.<br /><br />Deniro plays the role of a financial power broker eager to exploit the young man for his mental abilities.  In addition there'a an anonymous assassin trying to kill him, a Russian mobster to whom he owes a substantial amount of money, and the drug's side effects, all working to derail his plans for success.<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILER AHEAD<br /><br />How does it turn out?  Well, let's just say you shouldn't expect the usual, \\"when man plays God a monster is created!\\" story line that has been done a trillion times.  I like happy, inspirational endings and wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />I honestly can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie.  Acting, cinematography, writing, pacing, premise, etc., were all outstanding.  If you want a glimpse of the amazing and wonderful things the future may hold for humanity, then I give this film my very highest recommendation

I like that this one is a bit sturdier than some of the two dollar cables that I have purchased. But make no mistake, those two dollar cables give you the exact same quality as a $1000 cable.     Just make sure when buying you are buying the latest standard.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Every new fall season, there's this fear that my favorite TV shows wouldn't be on the roster. With CHUCK getting the nod for a fifth and final season, there's a sigh of relief. It's very hard for me to be impartial and critique this show. And I won't even try, really. But, okay, maybe I'll mention that perhaps CHUCK's getting only one more season may be a good thing. In Season 4, there's been a creeping sense of familiarity, a nagging worry that maybe, just maybe, the show's slowing down some.<br /><br />It's still a cool premise, hapless nerd secretly a brilliant spy. And the cast still demonstrates that banging chemistry. But the central tension always was in Chuck and Sarah's relationship. Once they formally became a couple in Season 3, I was happy as pigs in mud but also concerned about where the show would go from here on out, what with that central conflict being resolved. Remember what happened to MOONLIGHTING once David and Maddy hooked up?<br /><br />But CHUCK isn't all about a nerd's hopeless romantic pinings. And, in the area of wicked espionage and devilish plot twists and just plain exploiting the Intersect, the show exhibits plenty of legs. In Season 3's finale, Chuck had promised his sister that he's out of the spy game for good, and I think we all got a good snicker out of that. Like a phoenix from the ashes or a cockroach shrugging off the holocaust, the Burbank Buy More store is back, rebuilt and revamped and become a full-fledged, covert joint NSA/CIA operation. Because when Chuck Bartowski doesn't come to the spy game, the spy game comes to Chuck Bartowski.<br /><br />It's all a subterfuge, of course, his fellow spies assuming that Chuck had quit espionage, with Sarah pulling off missions with John Casey while Chuck frets at home. But Chuck is up to something. He's following leads on his long-thought-to-be-dead mother, with Morgan as his only backup. The subterfuge lasts only during the season opener, though. And, somewhere in this first episode, for fun, we get \\"sexting\\" between Chuck and Sarah, except that it's really between Morgan and an unwitting Sarah (ugh!). Chuck and Morgan even find time to attend a hand-to-hand combat class in, uh, \\"strip-kick,\\" a discipline which combines the \\"self-defense of Krav Maga with the intense core workout of pole dancing.\\" Heh.<br /><br />The rest of Season 4 tracks Chuck's search for his mom and the agents' ongoing mission to take down Volkoff Industries, a new criminal organization. Just about each episode explores a facet of Chuck and Sarah's relationship, ranging from their first fight as a couple to their inability to air out their feelings to why Sarah refuses to bring personal mementos with her on missions. But the show doesn't neglect its other characters, whether it's John Casey's own relationship with his daughter or Awesome and Ellie's pregnancy or Morgan's gradual inclusion into the inner circle (Morgan more or less worms his way in).<br /><br />Viewing CHUCK is like going to fan boy heaven. It's a big get, casting Linda Hamilton as Chuck's mom. Another nice conceit is that the new BuyMore regularly rotates a roster of agents whose name tag is always \\"Greta.\\" For the first few episodes, each week unveiled a new star cameo. So we see \\"Greta\\" being played by the likes of geek goddess Olivia Munn, Summer Glau, and even by the Old Spice guy. For villains, we get familiar sorts like Timothy Dalton, Lou Ferrigno, Richard Chamberlain, and Dolph Lundgren (who even quotes his famous Ivan Drago line).<br /><br />Another thing I love about CHUCK is that it never hesitates to upend the status quo. I love the unpredictability of the episodes. The characters evolve (well, maybe not Jeffster), and, as for Chuck's mom, for plenty of episodes, I wasn't entirely certain which side she'd fall on. At this stage, the challenge is how to keep Chuck Bartowski a total badasss on the field while still retaining his nerd creds. Thank goodness you can't totally shed your neuroses. I guess if you're a sorry bloke what happened to land a smoking hot girlfriend, chances are there's a part of you that'll always be insecure. Except that, lately, Chuck's development hasn't been as arrested.<br /><br />Just about each episode is terrific, but I did like some better than others, and here's a SPOILERS alert. In \\"Chuck Vs. The Cat Squad,\\" Chuck reunites Sarah with her old spy team. I love \\"Chuck Vs. Phase Three\\" because it reaffirms Sarah Walker's badassery. I love that a legend builds around Sarah as she carves a swath thru the jungles of Southeast Asia, beating up on guy after guy in her quest to find an Intersect-less Chuck. \\"Chuck Vs. The Muuurder\\" challenges Chuck's leadership skills when he's put in charge of a crucial mission, and then a murder mystery surfaces. And in \\"Chuck Vs. The Wedding Planner,\\" Chuck and Sarah are scammed out of their wedding money and Sarah reluctantly goes to her con man dad to get the money back.<br /><br />Despite mad support from its ardent fans, CHUCK, each season, has been on the brink of cancellation, so it's amazing and really gratifying that it's lasted this long. And, dammit, you know what, I take back what I said earlier. This show isn't in danger of growing stale. The stories are too inventive, the cast is too good, the humor too water cooler, and the hook simply too irresistible. Hell yes to Season 5.

0061148512|4.0|The Bell Jar is nicely written, and why it didn't receive unanimous acclaim when first published ia curious, but might be due to the high standards of literature in that era. Interesting as a description of mental decline, the book also incorporates ideas that became familiar only decade or so later: themes such as antipsychiatry, alienation, feminism, existentialism, and psychological self-description. In contrast, the writing style is very classic. Also interesting is that Plath does not, as is often the case, romanticize her adolescent depression--she is not a pining Young Werther with a truer insight or a more engaging personality because of her disorder. It is painful, not an increased source of insight. The plot is well known-a thinly veiled story of then collegiate Sylvia Plath interning at Mademoiselle in New York one summer, and thereafter, her decline.  Even at the books' beginning, it is apparent that Esther Greenwood, the Plath character, is injured--we learn more later about reasons. The detached, delicate, actually at times rather funny prose conveys her detachment--a dissociated woman aware, always ironically, of a talent that she now can't exercise, of her declining appearance, of her estrangement from any real relationships. She has an increasingly derealized perception of her world. Parties, meetings, and boyfriends come and go, and she registers all with a documentary self detachment. Assaulted sexually, she does not record the emotional pain, only a growing nehilistic emptiness. She goes through the motions, with boredom or disdain and as the internship progresses, so does her dissociated disdain. She tolerates then rejects her once worshipped boyfriend at Yale, now seen as dull and insufferable--as are many of the men (excpet her dead father), and, indeed, most of the women. After her internship, she is rejected for a writing workshop and this hastens her decline. Her mistrust and perplexity broaden--the patriarachal medical establishment, the world of wealth and privelege, the peculiartieis of other patients, her erstwhile friends. Her present self regardsg her former self as another person.  Yet even while in an asylum and confused, the implacable narrative style continues.  Plath, to her credit, was, in this book, extending the language of self-described deterioration. Her state is enhanced by the writing style-in the conventional or classic literary style of a more talented or sensitive soul observing a debased, insensitive world in which she only a marginal participant, and superior to--the world of wealth and entitlement, of elite schools, of libidinous peers, of fatuous authority figures, and smallminded neighbors. That this is a coming of age book for females has often been cited, and this style of perception is seen in many of those types of books--the young sensitive antihero who doesn't quite fit in, is romantically depressed, and has a finer vision. I thought the best part of the book is its literary qualities: its description, exactitude, and even wit--and the sense that Esther really is a pleasant and humble person underneath. Her devotion to writerly values is evident in the plot-the hastening of her decline after rejection from a writing workship, and the presence of the one true, uncriticized heroine, and older wealthy woman writer.

055380684X|5.0|There's been a lot written on this subject over the past few years and I've read much of it including:   Outliers, Talent is Overrated, The Talent Code, and Open. Yes, I would include Open, the auto-biography of Andre Agassi, to be a contribution to this theme. I'll explain why at the end.    Of these books, I think that the Talent Code is the most actionable for people who are looking to build skill and expertise for themselves, their kids, or their employees.     The book talks at length about how skill is built through mindful practice that develops myelin, a sort of neuron insulator. The key principles are that as we practice we strengthen certain neural pathways with myelin. To be exceptional at something is to have built up more myelin connections than average people.    The way we do that is through about 10,000 hours of mindful practice.  You'll certainly need a lot of drive to put in that amount of practice, and the book talks about what types of environments and cultures help contribute to that drive and even suggests how such a culture can be developed.  And it helps to have a great coach.    The book has lots of stories about mindful practice, hotbeds of talent, and great coaches. From these stories it draws principles that we can apply as individuals.     Outliers is a wonderful book and does a better job of illustrating the role that luck and cirumstances have to do with success. The Talent Code does a better job of helping you really understand what you can do as an individual to develop talent.     Open is a great auto-biography, and you'll get a first-hand look of one man's journey to becoming the best in the world at his chosen profession. It absolutely supports the theories in The Talent Code that says it is the thousands of hours of hard work, not god-given talent, that makes someone outstanding. It also shows the true cost of that type of commitment and practice and makes you ask the question if you're really up to the challenge or truly desireto be the best in the world at a competitive undertaking.

I bought one of these for my 86 year old aunt, and since she no longer wants to deal with live flowers, it worked out very well for her. She loves it and cannot wait to show her friends at the senior center.  There are green elastic straps attached to the covers so each arrangement can be held open for display. This item would be perfect for someone in a nursing facility or hospital as most no longer allow fresh flowers.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these books sometimes need to be \\"teased\\" into submission (to pop up correctly).  They are sometimes glued together where they should not be or not glued where they ought to be.  I order many of these and find that it is a good idea to go through each one before presenting it as a gift. I purchased six different ones this Christmas and only one was perfect but all the others were perfect with just a little help.
0345529057|1.0|Guys, as all of you Kindle owners I was horrified when I tried to buy those books for my Kindle - I thought it was simply ridiculous to have the Kindle edition cost more than the printed edition. Then I read all your reviews and I noticed that you blamed the publisher rather than Amazon. So I tried the following trick:    1) Get into Amazon, but not with your login, as if you were accessing the site from a public computer.   2) Search for Game of Thrones  3) See the price for the bundle: same price as printed edition  4) See the price for each individual book: something more than $9.00    Then you log yourself on.    1) Price for the bundle is more expensive.  2) Price for each individual book is less expensive than $9.00    All makes me think that Amazon can drive the prices here as well, it's not only the publisher to be blamed. I didn't carry my experiment on, but I will try to buy the Kindle bundle edition without having to log on to my account, let's see what happens. Is Amazon trying to lure new Kindle buyers at the expense of the old owners? Shame on you, Amazon, if this is the case.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I really like this watch. Its big and looks like a much higher quality piece. The face does not scratch easily; I am very hard on items like watches and am very impressed with how scratch resistant the face is. This watch fit me perfectly when I took it out of the box. I do have pretty big wrists though. The average person will probably have to get a few links removed. Setting alarms and such is pretty complicated, but I dont use them anyhow. Overall I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for that high end look without a high end price. I am very satisfied with this watch.
0446691437|5.0|Basically,    When a book, a non-ficiton book about writing, can make you cry- which it did to me- it becomes a favorite and the rare gem that you buy over an over again just so you can pass on to friends and hope they don't give back.    In the book Steven Pressfield points out a little known fact about Adolf Hitler's failed attempts at being an artist/painter. If this doesn't give the start to the book that it needed to get anyone's attention, I don't know what would.    I personnally love the book and its written with gentle and foreceful persuasion as well as kick-ass humor. Laughing out loud as tears streamed down my face, I took my ass to the computer and started writing again!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A dazzling completion to a wonderful Sci-Fi series cut down in it's prime. There is never a dull moment aboard \\"Serenity\\". Strong performances turned in by all actors. A \\"must see\\" for Joss Whedon fans all the way across the board! K. Runyan
B001G70M6S|5.0|I've used the 100b/c for my land camera and this is by far the best. For whatever reason the other films produce blurry photos  (not sure if its a camera issue or film issue). But photos from this film pack come out nice and clear!
030746363X|3.0|This is a refresher for many of the things we already knew like avoiding carbs and being conscience of everything you are eating (writing everything down).There were a few new concepts (using the kettle weight for one) but nothing earth shattering.  Important to note: you will lose 10 lbs instantly when you stop toting this heavy book around.
0345495004|4.0|\\"Loving Frank\\" is a novel about the epic love affair between architect Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Growing up in central Wisconsin, Frank Lloyd Wright was a name I often heard on the short list of bragging rights for the state. I had never heard of his somewhat legendary affair with Mamah until I picked up this historical fiction by Nancy Horan published by Ballantine Books in 2007...     [...]
1423101472|5.0|This is a satisfying conclusion to the five volume Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. Sometimes authors of serials \\"make it up as they go along\\" and the concluding installment is anticlimactic, contradictory, an out and out cheat, or just plain lame. That isn't the case here. Author Riordan seems to have plotted this out from very early in the series (I suspect shortly after the Lightning Thief) and everything comes together organically and naturally as if part of a plan. Although the book is packed with revelations it's still not overly long; just a few pages more than the Lightning Thief.<br /><br />The structure is different from the previous books. Those books, while advancing a larger plot, had a self contained story resolved in the book. In the present volume it's all about bringing that larger plot to a conclusion. The Titans attack and Percy and friends resist.<br /><br />The action takes place largely on Manhattan and the plot device hitherto used (the \\"Mist\\") to cloak immortal actions from mortal eyes is stretched to the breaking point. This is probably the weakest part of the plot but the author sugar coats it well enough for the reader to swallow.<br /><br />Highly recommended. There are plot hooks galore for future stories in this imaginary world and author Riordan is making full use of them.
B002N1AERI|5.0|I bought this album a few weeks ago. I think this is their best effort so far, They have achieved a good balance between the growling vocals and Simmone's beautiful voice. The songs are very well written and playing is excellent. I could easily recommend this album.For any one who is a fan of this type of music.
B00402FGEE|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this series!  It's an epic tale that will never see the length it deserved!  Shame on Sy-Fy (for their decision to cut this series short and their stoopid spelling choice on their branding!)  The story had much depth and infinite character possibilities. But we shall never know i guess...  This Blu-Ray is outstanding!  Get it!
0307887960|3.0|I was very excited to try this diet but weary because of being a vegetarian. This diet is definitely not for me. It advocates consuming mass amounts of chicken, meat and fish, all of which I oppose to eating. There was a small blurb on vegetarians, dismissively advising us to eat tempeh and tofu, which is about all he had to say about that.
032147404X|5.0|This book on digital photography is outstanding. Everyone who uses a digital would benefit from the advice to the information given on how to take a better picture.
1608870081|4.0|This book is great. I collect pop-up books and actually met the paper engineer, Bruce Foster, who was very charming. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will love this book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I can't believe how little I paid for this. There's a ton of room (I can fit a body with lens, plus about 4 other lenses, plus all my cables, etc.). I also really like the straps on the side that hold the tripod. The materials feel excellent. Very durable and does not look at all cheap. I'm a pretty big guy around the shoulders and the straps are a *little* tight, but not much. I could wear this comfortably for a while.
0525951652|1.0|This may come as a big shock to you, but the product has not been recieved yet!!!!  Book Time has been a great disappointment.  Ordered the book April 12,2011 as of today May 15, 2011, I have not heard from them.  When the time comes I will certainly review the vendor ( Book Time 123) for a total lack of service and honesty (with a Dis in front).
B001BKG9RQ|2.0|I am a big fan of floyd, Gilmour and Waters but this album didn't do it for me.  I think it (especially the first disc) was not typical floyd.  Seemed a little off base.  Maybe just me.
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|I really like this game but it skips and is really laggy at times I will change my rating to 5 stars once it is fixed.
B003VWW23M|5.0|Another reviewer compared this group to the beach boys and I'd have to agree that vocally, there's some definite similarities in the rich, melodic vocals. However, I'd say not only does this group owe some of it's sound to the Beach Boys and Yes, there's definitely some Flower Kings and early Spock's Beard type of music in their to boot. Overall it's an excellent album, but it does take you being in the right mood for there music as it's a much softer, greener type of prog-music than I'm used to hearing out of a new album nowadays. I'd compare it with \\"In the presence of\\" from Yes's Magnification album or even some of the more melodically rich songs from XTC. Definitely not too heavy, but very peaceful, enjoyable prog that is just different enough from anything else I have to be interesting and even a bit unique.<br /><br />Any fan of symphonic prog with emphasis on vocal melodies/harmonies with a hint of Flower Kings & Yes should enjoy this album quite a bit.
159668139X|5.0|I feel that I could sit down and warp a loom with minimal difficulties using this book alone. I learned a lot about warping and weaving without owning a loom. Definitely recommend this book
1594202842|1.0|I am an ABC (American Born Chinese), just as Amy Chau is.  I found it amusing where she mentions generations do not last after the 3rd.  If Amy wanted to keep the generations pure and alive and continuing, why didn't she marry a Chinese guy?  Because my own experiences tell me that a \\"real\\" Chinese guy doesn't want an ABC...in which to Amy's defense I will proudly support...because we are independent and will not kowtow to anyone.  I'm all for respectful children who are well mannered and sucessful in life.  Amy just has a strange controlling way of teaching it.  Sophia and Lulu will love their parents as most kids do, even the ones that have parents in jail and/or abusive. I wish them all well.  In Amy's eyes, I suppose in your eyes I have raised a degenerate low life ho hum honor roll student college student who works, has fun, learned to dance and play the violin and learned how to interact with many types.  I borrowed the book from the library and glad I did because I would have been mad if I spent a cent on this \\"garbage\\".  Halfway though, I had enough pain and didn't finish it.  Interesting though after the first few pages, it felt like it was written by a young person in middle school.  Jed, you are either a saint or a wimp.  Amy constantly reminded me of my paternal grandmother who was always ranting and raving about something and no one could ever do anything right.  Raised to have respect, I kept the words inside my head and believed my grandmother was a witch.  When I became of adult age, the \\"w\\" was exchanged to a \\"b\\".
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|The movie shipped fast, and was in new condition, just like it said. Both the DVD and the Blu ray works great.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I bought this movie after watching the first 2 with my child a zillion times.  I like this one the best.  It really goes more into Tinkerbell's friends, their personalities, and how they work together.  It also gives a great look at developing new friendships (with the little girl).  I would recommend this to anyone who has seen the first two movies.
B004XUD762|5.0|This album is brilliant! this is a must-buy for everyone. Overlord is epic and my favourite on the album. all loyal BLS fans should definitely get on it and buy it if they haven't already! Check out and join the legion at [...]  GIFD SDMF!!!
0618918248|5.0|I doubt I will be able to add anything substantial to these reviews, I just had to add in my 5 star review to raise the average. Dawkins, along with Christopher Hitchens, are the sharpest and most educated New Atheists, with rapier wit combined with amazing literary skills. Dawkins puts together a scientifically, philosophically, and logically sound argument that there is no personal God, no evidence for any sorts of supernatural beings (including God, Yahweh, what have you), and even a bit about evolution (which in this day and age is terrifying that people don't believe in). I highly recommend reading this book at least once so as to grasp the concepts with greater veracity in each subsequent reading. Heck, listen to the audiobook. Dawkins and a woman alternate reading the book, which allows for the reader to greater enjoy Dawkins razor sharp wit and keep track of some of the larger concepts (if one is an auditory learner).  Informative, funny, incredibly illuminating, and at times a bit depressing when he makes reference to such idiocy that leads so many billions of boxed thinkers. I cannot recommend this book (and especially the audiobook) enough.
B00005N5S2|2.0|This is actually a little painful to watch.  The production feels exactly like \\"Thorn Birds\\" or \\"Shogun\\".  Sure the sets and costumes are all first-rate.  Sure the supporting cast know their lines and don't bump into the furniture.  But....hmmmmm.....<br />The TV feeling gets more obvious and annoying the longer you watch.  You just want somebody to grab the camera and DO SOMETHING!  ARRRGH!  And there's Peck, walking here & walking there.  Looking at this & that.  He's acting's first rate considering he's  acting for television {{groan}}.  Though Peck was such an introverted actor, it's interesting to see him saunter about with most of his face covered up.  Introverted actors generally need closeups to show their mental wheels turning.  It would've been better to have a director like Franklin J. Schaffner, or just ANYBODY besides this \\"Jaws the Revenge\\" turkey.  Arrrgh! If it weren't for Peck, the whole thing would have the cinematic consistency of bubblegum  & sandpaper.  But even he can't save this beige disaster.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Excellent.  Wish I could have been there in person.  What a concert.      Oh yeah, it took a long time to get my copy from Amazon, but worth the wait.  Even my 86-year-old mother enjoyed it!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Quite simply put, the pricing model used here has lost you a sale.  I have read the books now twice in physical copy, and would love nothing more than to add them to my ever-expanding virtual library.  However, I will not be party to the gouging of the Kindle adopters in this fashion.    Please note this review is rated as such due to this tragedy of the open market, and in hopes that it will change based on this and similiar feedback.  The author should be fit to be tied as it is doing nothing but costing him money out of pure greed.  The books are fantastic works of fiction.    It really saddens me to see this happening to the Kindle community.
B002VECM72|5.0|Sandra Bullock is at her best and is supported with an outstanding cast. Based on a true story, The Blind Side, is an eye opening and wonderful story about the potential of someone who comes from a broken home, and given the opportunity with love and family can rise above.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought the Logitech G930 for three reasons, 7.1 audio, the wireless headset feature, and at $80, an unresistable price.  The G930 works well with Windows and the 7.1 audio is fabulous in the one game I play regularly (America's Army).  The real plus for me was that they do work in Linux with limited functionality.  I use Fedora as my primary OS, and the G930 works fine in stereo (not 7.1), so long as it's plugged into the USB tether when the computer is turned on.  After the machine is booted, you can unplug it and it will work just fine via the wireless.  While the G930 sounds great for movie playback, it's not as musically accurate as the PC-350.  They're a bit harsh musically, although rap and metal lovers will probably prefer the G930 because of the enhanced bass and treble in the EQ.    The Sennheiser PC-350 is a great headphone setup that uses standard audio plugs to connect to computer cards (as opposed to USB).  My audio card is built into a Gigabyte 890FXA motherboard and from an audiophile perspective, these are the most musical sounding consumer headphones I've used.  One thing I've noticed about the PC-350 besides being very comfortable, is that I experience less aural fatigue than I do with the G930.    Because I bought the G930 after the PC-350, I figured I would A-B them and then get rid of the ones I liked the least.  I will probably keep them both for different reasons.  Although the G930 is my primary headphone set (it's wireless, 7.1 sound), the PC-350 is far more accurate for serious musical listening, plus it has the old school audio plugs.
B004EPYZQC|2.0|pretty darn un realsitic    kinda a cowboy movie with cars    painfully predictable    so un realistic it hurts
B004VMUS9G|1.0|This ap did not work for me. I tried using it three different times, and all three times it was an epic fail! After alarm went off I tried to snooze it and it would not turn off.  I could not get it to stop.  I almost through my phone against the wall.  Once I had to take the battery out because I couldn't get it to turn off. I couldn't even force close the ap.  Terrible! Using EVO 4G.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|This is not a review of the movie (which I very much recommend) but a heads-up about the very disappointing but common practice that I have recently discovered about time limits on digital copies [...].  In other words, the disc comes with a digital copy BUT if you don't activate it by the expiration date you can't take advantage of it.  When I ordered the Sherlock Holmes Blu-ray in May I didn't know that it came with a digital copy (I don't think Amazon advertised it as having one - if you look closely at the customer photo of the product you might see it) but I was pleasantly surprised to see the digital copy feature advertised on the box when the movie arrived.  Surprise turned to disappointment and frustration when I tried to install the digital copy in iTunes. \\"Offer Expired\\" is what you get when you tried to use the enclosed code.  I wrote to Warner Bros and I got a \\"too bad - how sad\\" form letter:    \\"Hello,    We have researched your issue and this Digital Copy offer has expired. The Digital Copy offer is intended to be available only for a limited time following the initial release of the DVD and/or Blu-ray Disc. The expiration date is specifically stated on (a) the outside packaging of your DVD or Blu-ray disc, (b) the insert, (c) the Digital Copy disc, and/or (d) the redemption site.     We appreciate your feedback and continued support of Warner Home Video products and apologize for any inconvenience.     WB Digital Copy Support Team\\"    Hmm... I don't think they care about my feedback or my inconvenience.  While I never condone breaking copy-right laws, after this experience I now have a LOT more sympathy for those who do.  I think the movie industry intends this practice to encourage customers to purchase the movie sooner while the price is high to take advantage of additional features. It won't work.  Not only because of poor marketing - I had never heard of this practice until today but also because it will encourage otherwise law-abiding citizens tolearn how to copy DVD's themselves.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|got it it to read school books, instead of opening the pdf files, it blinks then dumps you back at the book list.  might be do to the fact that the pdf files are over 25 megs but should say that.
B003L77GH4|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is THE best show on television it has everything you could possibly want in a show drama, action, romance and a beautiful cast that can ACT!. This show out does it's self every week, it keeps you on the edge of your seat cause you never know what they're gonna throw at you, it's totally unpredictable and thats what makes it soooo good so if you have never watched it i suggest you get season one and two because once you start to watch you just cant stop.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Now this movie was different, I'll say that.  This is the remake version.  I haven't seen the older one yet.  But how it unfolds is very interesting.  One thing I don't understand is the rape scene. They show over and over and run-down building that has a mattress in it.  The cabin she stays in also has a bed, right?  She tries to run away and they catch her.  You'd think they'd drag her back to a mattress, but no!  They do her on the ground with a lot of brush all over and with her head in a puddle of water.  Why?  Maybe to keep the suspense up?  Because of the questionable unfolding of the story, I have to give it 4 stars.  Otherwise, an interesting movie if you're into that kind of thing.  Personally, I felt very bad for her.  I could relate to her as a woman.  I was pleased when she killed each of them in a very gruesome manner!  God knows she would not have otherwise gotten justice.
0064430170|5.0|Wish I would have purchased the bored book version because my baby loves this book- we will read it often!
B0046ZPFL4|4.0|Ohhh, Patty and Walter, how I hated you...how I loved you. When I started this audiobook, I felt great apathy for the characters. All I could think was, thank goodness I don't have a neighbor like Patty. I even stopped the book and listened to something else more engrossing, but alas, I came back to Freedom and I'm glad I did. After spending more time getting to know the Berglunds, I found my loyalties switching between characters as I learned more about their life experiences and point of view. In the end, this was a very satisfying read. I can say I don't need a sequel to this book, which is a rare feeling with the stories I read these days. It was nice knowing you, Berglunds.
B004Q7DR5I|5.0|REVIEW: 5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />What a wonderful start to this new series by Thea Harrison, it kept me riveted from page one right to through the end.<br /><br />The excitement begins when Pia Giovanni a half-human, half-wyr is black-mailed by her ex-boyfriend into breaking into the most ancient and most powerful Wyr Dragons hoard to steal an item from his significant collection. Pia opts to steal a 1962 penny, although she does replace it with a note and a penny of her own she knows she is in deep trouble so grabs some of her secret identities, a large sum of cash and starts running.<br /><br />Dragos Cuelebre is the absolute ruler of the Wyr race, he hasn't been challenged in a long time and is bored so sees the break-in as somewhat amusing as well as worrying for him that someone could actually locate his hidden den and break through his wards. So the hunt begins to find the person responsible and dole out suitable punishment.<br /><br />Upon learning the reasoning behind Pia's betrayal, Dragos offers her a deal she finds hard to refuse and finds herself in a world of magic she has spent her life being warned about by her mother and has desperately tried to avoid.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the relationship between Dragos and Pia, their banter had me laughing out loud, he was feared by everyone but she stood up to him and seemed to be the only one able to calm him when his temper threatened to flair. She was yet another of his possessions, he was enthralled, intrigued and captured by the mystery that is Pia.<br /><br />It is a page turning exciting and sensual read that fans of the Paranormal Romance genre are certain to devour.<br /><br />I loved the amazing secondary characters, especially Tricks the miniscule and outspoken faerie as well as the other sexy sentinel dragons; Rune, Constantine, Graydon and Bayne, their loyalty and camaraderie was wonderful as was their fierce protective streak, I enjoyed the banter between them.<br /><br />I found the reasoning behind Pia's inability to shift fascinating and boy was it an important reason!<br /><br />The author has created an amazing and unique mythical world filled with Fae, Elves, Dragons, Witches and Goblins, an intriguing plot and a satisfying love story; it will leave readers wanting more.<br /><br />Ms Harrison is sure to win many readers with this wonderful new release, I highly recommend Dragon Bound and look forward to the release of Storm's Heart, book 2 in the Elder Races series.oning behind Pia's inability to shift fascinating and boy was it an important reason!<br /><br />The author has created an amazing and unique mythical world filled with Fae, Elves, Dragons, Witches and Goblins, an intriguing plot and a satisfying love story; it will leave readers wanting more.<br /><br />Ms Harrison is sure to win many readers with this wonderful new release, I highly recommend Dragon Bound and look forward to the release of Storm's Heart, book 2 in the Elder Races series.
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|I haven't been too keen on R.E.M.'s past few albums. There's been way too much tinkering and noodling with production trickery simply because Stipe and company can afford to spend an eternity in the studio. New Adventures in Hi-Fi (1996) was the last really interesting record these guys put out and it was long and substantial too, at 60 minutes or so. New Adventures...also didn't sound over-produced or fussed over. While many critics hailed Accelerate as the return of R.E.M., that short album rocked hard but seemed sorely lacking in real tunes. Collapse Into Now is different. In a concise 41 minutes the band has managed to capture all of the elements that make a great R.E.M. album. There are lovely melodious tunes like Oh My Heart, Uberlin, Walk It Back, cool rockers like opener Discoverer and the single Mine Smell Like Honey, even something a bit out there in closer Blue (with amazing vocals from Patti Smith). It's been a long time since I've heard R.E.M. this engaged in the material. And Michael Stipe's singing is really great throughout. Peter Buck has some pretty memorable riffs. And the band is clearly having fun. The record sounds good, although I do understand what people are saying about all the instruments being set to stun in terms of loudness. The producer could have taken a more subtle hand with things. And I think that is ultimately why I'll give Collapse Into Now three stars and not four. If you are an R.E.M. fan you will enjoy the new one.
B000056HE9|1.0|Asking $38.60 for this DVD is outrageous, ridiculous and borders on usury, theft and highway robbery!  When it has collected enough dust on your shelf and you lower the price to a realisxtic one, let me know.  As good and enjoyable as this film is that price is insane!
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|This film was so bad that I thought it had to be a Disney one.  Depp seems to have sold his soul to Disney, so why not?  Well it's a Sony film not Disney, but it was just as bad as fifty other films Disney has made.
B003VOUGV0|5.0|I was introduced to Best Coast this winter, at the time all that was available were demos and one EP that sounded unfinished. I was pretty dismissive of it at the time, it sounded just like all the other lo-fi California bands getting endlessly hyped. This summer I heard \\"Boyfriend\\" the delightfully desperate single of Best Coast's first album, and I was hooked. I literally wore that track out, I probably listened to it 100 times the first week. It was sad and catchy and simple and just the best. When I listened to the full album Crazy For You, I was delighted to find that almost all the tracks sounded identical to Boyfriend. The whole album reads like a single chick's diary and it is awesome and embarrassing and feels honest and free from pretension.<br /><br />Every song on CFY washes over you, making it an easy album to listen to again and again. BC is influenced by the same 60s sound as She & Him, but their rough around the edges interpretation makes it all the more listenable. There's something about hearing Bethany Cosentino coo about smoking weed, and cuddling with cats that's totally refreshing and fun. As far as I'm concerned CFY is the soundtrack to the summer, and I have come to LOVE Best Coast even though Bethany is dating Nathan Williams ~_~.
B002C6K7N0|1.0|I would like to say this album is boring and poor written.Unlike united abominations this album has goofy lyrics and no good guitar solos. I Hope megadeths next cd is better.
1932907009|5.0|I'm not a screenwriter, but I found this book to be a wonderful guide into how movies work.    Snyder describes movies as Swiss-clock-like emotion machines, and his method breaks the gears down to show you how they are put together. Someone interested in writing screenplays will find the advice invaluable, as Snyder dissects a movie into small, manageable chunks so that you can see how to make each piece.     But it's equally enjoyable for someone who's just interested in watching movies. After reading this book, I started seeing movies in a whole different light: I can see how the B story functions; I can tell when the midpoint is giving you that false sense of victory/defeat; I can see how all the \\"beats\\" in the script make appeals to very primal instinctual desires.    If you like movies at all, you'll enjoy this book. It's definitely not meant for writers alone.
B001TODO54|5.0|Katsa is running faster than she has ever run before.    Katsa is unwelcome-always unwelcome. Her uncle was a king, her cousin a prince, and her friend a spymaster, yet people avoid her. This is not because she had different color eyes, or was extremely shy, but because she had a grace, a grace for killing. It was because of this grace that she made the Council, and because of the Council, she rescued the Prince of Lienid, and met Po.    She never expected to become Po's friend. She thought he was an arrogant fool, a vain fool at that, she was used to being superior. She did not dwell on it, but she knew that when it came to fighting, any fighting, she would always win.  But he wouldn't let her go that easily. So he fought her. He hurt her, but she hurt him more, and by the end of their fight, they were friends.     She was his friend, and he hers. Even through the deception of his grace, she was his friend. She came very close to becoming his enemy when he told her that his grace wasn't fighting. His grace was physical  energy.  Katsa needed to get away, away from her uncle, and his advisers. Po was leaving to go to Monsea, and so, she went with him. Po knew his grandfather had been captured by Leck, and that Leck was graced with being able to convince people of anything. The problem was what Po didn't know, Po didn't know why.
B002VECLVO|4.0|Tom Ford's A Single Man left me feeling more conflicted than any other movie this year. On the one hand, the whole movie felt labored. I could feel Tom Ford actively directing each shot, and it didn't work to the movies credit. The characters are handled so preciously, each event given such gravitas, and oftentimes it felt unwarranted. I understand using visual cues to indicate George's emotional state, but using something as basic as saturating the colors whenever a good-looking young man excites him simplifies his emotions.<br /><br />That being said, the men (and the movie) ARE beautiful. I did find myself swept up in the imagery, but to the detriment of my investment in the story and the characters. The film's focus on visuals actually made me perceive George as shallow, and even made me marginalize his grief. The only character that seemed likable was Charlotte; George's long-time friend and one time lover who's still pining over him in vain. In the best scene in the movie George and Charlotte share drinks and we see the contrasting ways they deal with their loneliness, and dissatisfaction. While Charlotte is explosive, first lashing out at Geroge, then resorting to her sense of humor to keep her sane, George is scarily even-tempered. He's matter-of-fact and even condescending towards Charlotte; marginalizing her suffering. Charlotte means far less to George than George to Charlotte, and this is indicative of the overall attitude towards females in the film. Women in the movie were merely accessories, they serve as arm candy for the men, as temporary distractions for the leading men. I loved seeing this as it in such stark contrast to they way women are usually sexualized and worshiped on film.<br /><br />Another great part of he movie was Nicholas Hoult as Kenny, the tempting young student of George's. His fake American accent was totally distracting (especially to Skins fans who know him better as Tony Stonem), but his looks make up for any other possible deficiency he could exhibit.exhibit.

1595141715|5.0|\\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" by Jay Asher is a very interesting book. This book in particular would have never ended up in my hands, mostly because of the name and cover. Also, I had never heard of the author before, but after reading the back of the book I was blown away. I for one believe that Jay Asher did a very good job in the making of the story, and especially on the details that he implies when he is describing the scene. If I am given the choice to read such a book all over again I would. Hey, maybe even two more times.    In the beginning of the book they talk about a girl named Hannah Baker. In this book she is new to town and wasn't to be able to start a new life with new friends and a new reputation...but what she gets instead no one deserves. In the book she is faced with so many terrible things that she kills herself, and that's when the beginning actually starts. Luckily, before she died she made sure that everyone who hurt her would pay for it by being faced with 13 tapes. In each tape she describes a new character or, just mentions them again.   Soon in the story a boy named Clay Jonson appears and is one of the thirteen reasons Hannah committed suicide. In the whole story Clay has no reason why he's in the tapes and what he did to Hannah that made her want to committee suicide. But whenever he thinks of her he can only go back to the night of the party. There were so many rimes in the book that he says if there was anything he could have done to have saved her, and then he would have been so happy.   In the first tape, everyone who is listening is threatened that if they don't pass the tapes on to the next person on the list, it doesn't matter because someone is watching them and will send more tapes out to the world. With the tapes Hannah included a map. On the map are squares and it kind of works like battle ship. While listening to the tapes Hannah will tell you to go to \\"E5\\" or something like that, so that you know where she was.   I would give thisbook a 5 out o f 5. This book is truly amazing. I love this book. I hope that if you read this book you'll love it too.
0316056863|5.0|I've been charged up with Fey's unique brand of feminism since reading her memoir earlier this month. If you haven't read Bossypants yet, we don't know each other personally, because I've been nagging the pants off every woman I know since the book's release. I am annoying, but it's with good reason, Bossypants is a tough sell, the cover features Fey in a bowler hat (?) cradling her face with hairy man hands (???), and the title is awful; Bossypants. However, Fey's explanation of the title almost makes up for the travesty in branding. As executive producer of 30 Rock, Fey is often asked \\"is it hard being the big boss?\\". Tina bristles at these questions, and points out that these questions would never be directed at male captains of industry.<br /><br />Fey is sarcastic, witty and completely unapologetic. The best part about Bossypants is how completely honest it is without being obnoxiously self-deprecating. Fey knows she's successful and smart, but she doesn't shy away from telling stories about getting her period (suck it up boys, you can read about this stuff without your balls falling off) and falling in love with gay boys.<br /><br />If  you still haven't bought your copy of Bossypants (amazon) you're an idiot, but I am forgiving so I will try once more to convince you, using Tina's words.<br /><br />Fey on the biggest difference between male and female comedy writers: \\"...also the men sometimes pretend to rape each other, the women never do that\\".<br /><br />On how modern women are pigeonholed as bitches or bimbos: \\"\\"There was an assumption that I was personally attacking Sarah Palin by impersonating her on TV. No one ever said it was `mean' when Chevy Chase played Gerald Ford falling down all the time. No one ever accused Dana Carvey or Darrell Hammond or Dan Aykroyd of `going too far' in their political impressions. You see what I'm getting at here. I am not mean and Mrs. Palin is not fragile. To imply otherwise is a disservice to us both.\\"<br /><br />I think my only problem with Tina Fey is that I can't decide who to idolize more, her or her 30 Rock character Liz Lemon.I can't decide who to idolize more, her or her 30 Rock character Liz Lemon.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book first as a possible \\"teach\\" book for my high school students and consequently read the next 2 books too!  I loved the characterizations and plot but also the parallels from ancient Roman culture and our present day culture all set in the future.  I then purchased a small set and my kids are devouring the story!!  Terrific discussion will ensue!!! By the way, the young woman who did her student teaching with me this spring couldn't put the novels down once she started.

As good if not better than anything Pixar has put out. You have certainly stepped up your game!     A great remix on the traditional super hero orgin story. Dialog is clever, no, no... \\"brilliant\\". Still chuckling inside at the comedic irony.     Another thing I noticed and appreciated was the nearly perfect facial expressions. Just uncanny... Really a fantastic job. I'm anxious to see the next project.
B003Y5HWGI|3.0|We finally finished this 7th season, trying to catch up to the current one now that it's over. This 7th was the first time we felt that the show was getting stale, predictable, and beginning to create story lines out of thin air just to keep it going. We loved the show before this, but we are now sort of sad it got renewed. Producers: Put a fork in it, it's done! It was a good run but it's played out.

It has been 5 years now, and there isn't a day that goes by where I am not referencing to the television series, graphic novels or movie to answer questions posed by friends and those who have never had the extreme pleasure of seeing a man show his most vulnerable side and such a uniquely and innovative way.<br /><br />The directing is flawless, the cast is amazing and everyone-save YoSafBridge, has a merry time. Heck, Jayne even gets a rain stick and a great hat.<br /><br />So take a risk and hop on board Serenity with the rest of the Whedonites, you will not be disappointed.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Back in 1975, I was paying for my college tuition working as a night watchman in the offices underneath the Queensboro Bridge in Manhattan. The engineer's office had a big bay window and a great sounding tube radio that would glow orange in the dark. I spent most of my time at a desk in an adjoining office, studying with a desk light, when one night, I heard this lonely trumpet from far away in no man's land start playing. I put my book down and listened. I had on a rock station, the best (WNEW-FM), but this wasn't rock. But it was something I understood. I got up and walked into the engineer's office. The blinds were opened, a light (from a streetlamp, or a full moon, I don't remember) filled the office with slashes of light, just like in the movies. I stared at the radio, mesmerized, by this sound and this story of two losers, way out of their depths, trying to make a score with some pretty no-nonsense type guys and all through the song that trumpet played, way out in the distance, all the way in the back of the record. It seemed to represent their dreams--visable, but somehow, always, just out of reach. When the song ended, I kept standing there in the dark, looking at the radio. I felt like I heard something I never heard before. WHAT WAS THAT? WHO was that??!! Who would have the balls to put out somthing so uncommon, so true to life, yet so different that despite it's perfect execution, was sure to go over everyone's head? I felt in that dark room, the song was made just for me. The great Allison Steele, The Nightbird finally came on announcing that was \\"Meeting Across The River\\" by Bruce Springsteen. That was my introduction to Springsteen's music. I went out and bought BORN TO RUN the next day and was astounded. The rock n roll that was on there told me that this guy knew and remembered who Phil Spector was. It was the sound that was in my heart since I first heard \\"Be My Baby\\" when I was a kid. But these weren't puppy-love songs from a musical era criminally forgotten, but fear-fueled dreams of winning or losing or escape from whatever dead end street that resides at the bottom of life. The cry that ends \\"Backstreets\\" or the absolute HOWL that closes \\"Jungleland\\", still rattles my soul and like \\"Meeting...\\", still makes me wonder, \\"You can put that on a record\\"?forgotten, but fear-fueled dreams of winning or losing or escape from whatever dead end street that resides at the bottom of life.

B000AP04L0|1.0|I ordered a widescreen version from this retailer. Not only did I get a fullscreen version in the mail (along with an invoice that confirmed I ordered the widescreen), the DVD would not play in any player I owned (which is 4).

B00006JDVV|5.0|I used this film as an example of myth, symbolism, and archetypes in my Creative Writing class. The hero, the antagonist, the sage, the keeper of the dead, a dragon -- it's all here!<br /><br />What director Rob Bowman accomplishes with camera angles, juxtaposing primitive technology against new, is powerful in every frame of the film. One particularly succinct example is the image of helicopter blades overshadowing a windmill and the young boy standing bewildered on the cusp of both worlds.<br /><br />Beyond that, I think this might be one of Matthew McConaughey's finest performances because he is so anti-Hollywood pretty boy in this film. In this he is coarse and driven, an Ahab character obsessed with catching his dragon-leviathan. Even Christian Bale and Gerard Butler seems to be most interested in making a good film and not with being movie stars. Their friendship in the film is endearing and inspiring.<br /><br />This movie is brilliant on many levels, and the dragon is the scariest one I have ever seen rendered on the screen.<br /><br />Own it, because once you watch it, you'll want to visit it again and again.

1439102724|3.0|The story was entertaining, the issues were controversial and I have no problems with her portrayal of homosexuals.    However, for someone who claims to be \\"open-minded\\" and to \\"explore all sides of the issue\\" this story was VERY much one-sided. I am a christian. I do NOT have a problem with homosexuals. Nor do I have a problem with them raising children, adopting children, or recieving IVF treatment. Yet, according to this book, I must do. I ought to.    I hve always been a huge fan of Picoult's, but I have to say that based on her treatment of Christianity within this novel, she has put me off.    Ms Picoult, I know that Christianity isn't \\"cool\\", whereas being a lesbian clearly is \\"in\\" at present, but take time to research BOTH attitudes towards an issue - not just the one that genders most sympathy. Christianity is an easy scapegoat and your portrayal of true Christians was not at all accurate. If anything, the lesbian characters were the true bigots for refusing to open their eyes to another way of thinking.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I purchased this headset to replace a cheap one that continually hurt my ears. I wear headphones for a large portion of my day both at work and at home, usually as long as I can before it becomes painful. The most important thing I was looking for was a headset that would be comfortable when worn for 5-6+ hours at a time, and this headset has exceeded that at a price significantly less than what I was expecting to pay. The headphones sit totally off my ears and the soft material covering them is very comfortable and does not get too hot during extended use. The sound response and microphone quality are totally adequate; I use these to listen to music and movies with no complaints, although sound quality is not something I'm very picky about. I use the microphone frequently and have had no problems with voice quality. If you are looking for a comfortable headset, I doubt you could do much better at this price point. I was expecting to pay $50-$60 but I am very happy with these for half the price and I just purchased a second pair as a gift for a friend.

0763644765|5.0|Simple text, bold graphics, pleasing colors. My 2 year old loves \\"reading\\" this board book by herself. She also likes the panels where the baby sits down on the potty, but then says oops, and gets up to remove his diaper (she thinks its quite funny). Then he gets up to go get a book and returns with his potty book. This is very similar to the sequence of operations she herself goes through.    I think this is likely to be one of the books she will be able to read by herself in several months / years. Although it has small letters can caps, it is still very simple and invites a young reader to try.    We both love the sweet and simple message of the potty for baby. Would definitely make a good gift for a young family.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie despite the controversy which you can see if you read the other reviews here. The movie has as many 1 and 2 star reviews as four star reviews, showing how divisive the movie was and how divided opinion really is about it. But for myself, I enjoyed it as it took the original franchise off in a couple of new directions despite a few minor problems which I mention below.<br /><br />The concept of a \\"game preserve\\" hunting planet is a nice touch, as well as the introduction of an even bigger and stronger crab-like super-predator. With the bad-guy humans now the hunted rather than the hunters, it sets the stage nicely for the rest of the plot. The special effects matte shot scene where the newly prey (humans) look out over the valley and see the two moons and main planet in the sky, realizing that they're now on another world, is also awesome, and a nice allusion to the first Star Wars movie that is often reprised in sci-fi movies since.<br /><br />The choice of human characters was quite controversial. They're all bad guys, including convicted murderers, drug cartel kidnappers, tribal mantrackers and torturers, and professional mercenaries who have hunted and killed for various reasons back on earth. Now they're the hunted, but some reviewers here found this cast of characters so unsympathetic they they were rooting for the aliens to win instead of the humans.<br /><br />Also, it's good to see Lawrence Fishburne is still working, and actually looking pretty buffed at his age. Of course, many will remember him from his important role in the first Matrix movie. His role as a cagey, tough, but a bit crazy survivor was brief but memorable.<br /><br />The only weaknesses for me were Fishburne turning on the new arrivals. It would have been so much better if he had collaborated with them to defeat the alien hunters and and commandeer the alien spaceship as they discussed. With his intimate knowledge of the planet and the predators, having survived 10 seasons there by himself, this would have been a much better way to utilize his character.<br /><br />The alien booby-trap technology, weapons and armor, and hunting strategies are varied and deadly and displayed to good effect in the movie.<br /><br />So despite a few problems, overall, a good sequel and worthy action movie even if it tries too hard at times to pay homage to the original movie rather than trying to break new ground and depart too far from the original concept.have been a much better way to utilize his character.

1554072840|5.0|My child and I love this sweet little book. She goes to grab it before her potty-time. As the author herself suggests, I simply use the terminology I am used to using with her, rather than the words used in the book. I actually translate the words into my native language, Tamil, rather than any of the words in the book at all.    My 2 year old is not following all the sentences in the book, but she is captured by the story and pictures and has definitely absorbed the overall message. The story is positive about Prudence's use of the potty. Prudence tries once, is discouraged by her first failure and then tries again much later, waits patiently and finally sees her potty in use. This book also explains how Prudence's mother has been changing her diaper from the time she was an infant. This is particularly fascinating for my daughter who seems to be really thinking about the idea that she was once an infant.     I do wish the potty looked less like a chamber pot of yore and more like a modern potty, but it sure doesn't seem to be a problem. My child totally gets that it is a potty.     The pages of this book are sturdy although it isn't a board book. It is easy for a little one to turn the pages themselves and the pages have some tooth to them, so it doesn't stick together.    Overall a wonderful find. Would make a great gift for a toddler parent.

B004SUDQ4U|5.0|I love Amazon, but they do seriously need to get their details in their product descriptions correct.    In this Das Boot description we have, first, this, in \\"Product Details\\":    \\"Run Time: 149 minutes\\"    Then, beneath, under \\"Editorial Reviews\\":    \\"This 282-minute version of Das Boot is the full-length TV series, originally shown in six parts but here edited into a seamless whole.\\"    So which is it? The director's cut of the feature film or the TV series version?     Sadly, this discrepancy is an all too common feature in Amazon's descriptions--a tough thing if there are several versions of a film available. (But 5 stars--for any version--of this great film.)
1423389387|5.0|It's no secret--The Name of the Wind was a marvellous book.  So marvellous, in fact, that I worried a)that there would never be a sequel, and that the author would hide, knowing he could not equal his previous brilliance and b)that if there were a sequel, I would be disappointed.  I mean, how can you live up to the level of hype that this book has already received in fantasy circles?  Especially if your name isn't George R.R. Martin?  George has had 30+ years to learn to walk on water and turn out ASOIAF.  This is Rothfuss' second book.  I am happy to report, however, that Rothfuss cements his name in the fantasy firmament with this novel, and has me desperately wanting more.      Kvothe is one of the most interesting, well considered characters in fantasy literature.  His story is fascinating, and ultimately, it is the tale told by this unlikely, amazing man that makes this story stick.  The scope of the story opens up--way up--in this tale, and the world has become a much more detailed, dangerous, beautiful, exotic, glorious place.  A great place to set an epic fantasy, in other words.  And keep in mind that thhis was no small feat, as Kvothe-world was already a living beast, a world worth inhabiting.  The side characters come into sharper focus--Auri, Will, Simmon, Master Elodin, they all become folks you know, that you care for, and who, like real folks, keep surprising you.  The friendships between the characters are deeper, and it doesn't feel fake when they make sacrifices for each other--it seems like what you would really do for people you love, and that is because Rothfuss takes his time, lets his story breathe, and shows you some of the small stuff that builds relationships, so when the big stuff comes, it makes sense and isn't a fake payoff.    What kept me riveted, though, was the way in which this wonderful story was told--Rothfuss' prose retains the assuredness of his first novel, but he has clearly learned a trick or two in the mean time.  Descriptions are spot on, plot twists keep you on your toes--and sometimes, they make your heart stop. I've already intimated that his characters are deep and satisfying.      There is no reason to fear.  This is a worthy sequel to the first novel, and well worth the SIGNIFICANT time investment it will take to get through this doorstop of a novel.  But you won't regret it.  If you haven't read \\"Name of the Wind\\", you have to start there first.  But rush out and get this one at the same time--you'll be sad if you don't have it to start on as soon as NOTW is done!    A note on the audio edition: I listened to this on CD in my car, and at first I was a little disappointed by the quality of the narrator's voice.  He has a light voice, a tenor, and I always imagined a more gravelly, deep voice as narrating this tale.  Well, I shouldn't have worried.  The narrator's quality is first rate.  His ability to bring life to the story was very satisfying, and now I don't know what I was complaining about.  I can't imagine anyone but this guy reading to me. Really enjoyable.

It doesn't compete the high end backpacks, like the Lowe Pro, but for a smaller set of cameras and gear (one camera, a couple of lenses, and accessories), it's great. It fits a small person well, and feels light and small to someone larger. The interior is highly configurable, and even has straps that cross some of the containers so things won't fall out if it's opened vertically.

0808519387|4.0|A timeless classic everyone should read; one of the few great pieces of literature written from a right wing point of view.  This particular edition is very compact (appr 4X7 inches) which has its advantages but forces the use of very small type, too small for many people to comfortably read.  My 4-star review is not 5-star solely because of the type size.
0300169787|5.0|Alexander McQueen (17 March 1969 - 11 February 2010) was an icon in the fashion industry.  He is currently the subject of a spectacular exhibition of his works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art  and this book serves as  a catalogue for that exhibition.  From the lenticular cover by Gary James McQueen ('Lenticular printing is a technology in which a lenticular lens is used to produce images with an illusion of depth, or the ability to change or move as the image is viewed from different angles') to the layout or deign of the book itself to the extraordinary photography (by Sølve Sundsbø) this book is an art piece by itself.<br /><br />McQueen drew notice with his fashions that made femininity collide with masculinity, gowns and dresses that created a continuing dichotomy between life and death, lightness and darkness, predator and prey, man and machine. His uses of fabric and elements not usually considered wearable resulted in very bizarre and at the same time hauntingly beautiful creations that, placed on mannequins, could be considered sculptures.  And that is how the exhibition and the catalogue are constructed. 'The Romantic Mind' shows soft fashion lines against a concrete backdrop, 'The Romantic Gothic' recalls a term McQueen used for his designs - 'the Edgar Allen Poe of fashion', 'Romantic Nationalism' is a display of the Scottish versus the British mindset  transformed into clothing, and the Objects gallery reveals strange objects of many types that explain how he viewed the world.<br /><br />There is a fine Preface written by Andrew Bolton who curated the exhibition, an Introduction by Susannah Frankel, an interview by Tim Banks with the now almost equally famous Sarah Burton (designer of Kate's Middleton's Royal wedding gown). 'The exhibition, organized by The Costume Institute, celebrates the late Alexander McQueen's extraordinary contributions to fashion. From his Central Saint Martins postgraduate collection of 1992 to his final runway presentation, which took place after his death in February 2010, Mr. McQueen challenged and expanded the understanding of fashion beyond utility to a conceptual expression of culture, politics, and identity.

B004LP601S|5.0|I have been a fan of Panic! at the Disco for a few years now and have loved all the albums this far. I know they got a lot of crap for Pretty.Odd., but being a Beatles and classic rock fan, I still enjoyed it. On Vices and Virtues, Panic! returns to their \\"Fever\\" sounds yet it is fresh and fun. I still listen to the album a few times a week and don't skip a single song. In fact, every time I listen to the album I am always so surprised and a little bummed at how quickly it ends. If you liked their first album, it is a safe bet you will like Vices and Virtues. And if you never listened to a single song of theirs, this is a fun album so its worth trying it out. You never know, you may just become an instant fan.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I saw this while browsing the Amazon store and, yeah.. It's awesome. Downloaded straight to my Droid with no problem. Opened up the App, downloaded a video and watched it.    I wondered where it put the videos once they were downloaded and thought \\"Man, it would be great if it went to the gallery in a separate folder\\". Thats exactly what it did.    I shall fill my memory card in no time with videos full of stupid cats, people hurting themselves and overall win :)
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I am sick of publishers trying to screw over those of us who have forked out a lot of money for our Kindles.  There is no excuse for the Kindle edition of a book to cost more than any print edition.  Since I love the story, I would have been happy to buy this item had it been fairly priced.  However, Random House' greed lost them the sale.

By page 6 I came to the conclusion that the author was an ass who couldn't write.  By page 30 I realized that he was a pompous ass who couldn't write.  After that I put the book down and I probably won't pick it up again until another hurricane hits my area, wipes out the electricity for two weeks and I have absolutely no other form of entertainment available.
0060531053|5.0|I bought this book as my first lesson in homebrewing, and am very pleased with the information it supplied. Some of the techniques are a little out of date, but they can still be used without undesirable results. The book provides info for everything from simple extract all the way up to the most advanced homebrewing techniques, so even seasoned brewers can benefit from its pages.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's books are always enjoyable to read.  I recommend his other books \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\" . Out of all three books \\"Outliers\\" is the best.      In all of Gladwell's books I think he makes his conclusions to hastily and he leaves little room for the effects of extraneous variables, many of which could invalidate his arguments, but how he comes to these conclusions is interesting.  His books are full of interesting anecdotes and facts (which I'll admit are interpreted through his own lens) but are enjoyable to read nonetheless.    If you are going on a long vacation I recommend you take more than one of his books.  His books are so well written and enjoyable to read that you will find yourself on the last page before you realize it.

0670022411|5.0|I had not known much about this book when I bought it but I was captivated from the beginning!  I even wrote to the author by e-mail before I was even finished to tell her how much I was enjoying her book!  It is well written and there is just enough magic and romance and suspense to keep you turning the pages.  I cannot wait for books two and three and was delighted to find out that this book was the first of a trilogy!!  I highly recommend reading A Discovery of Witches!!!
B004Q7DQLS|3.0|Pia Giovanni has just stolen a treasured item from the horde of an ancient and powerful dragon.  A feat that has never been accomplished before.  The worst part was she had not wanted to do it in the first place.  An ex-boyfriend blackmailed her a few months after their break-up with the threat of revealing secrets she had entrusted him with while they were still together.  So for her, she had no choice but to use her unique talents to obtain the item he wanted.  Now she is on the run and fearing for her life.<br /><br />Dragos, the ancient dragon Pia stole from is furious that anyone could gain access to his horde and steal something.  His outraged reaction can be felt thoughout New York.  He becomes focused on the identity of thief and has every intention of exacting retribution for the crime.  Yet once he discovers who the person is, everything doesn't go quite as planned.  Pia is like no other woman he has met in his long existence.  Soon they are working together to find who orchestrated the theft.  They have realized both their lives are on the line as part of a play for power.  Before it is all over, neither of them will be the same.<br /><br />The story line and plot for this novel are great.  The book is entertaining and can keep the reader engrossed in what will happen next.  The real problems come with the dialog.  In most cases, when an author has a character who is thousands of years old, that person tends to speak more formally without a lot of slang.  This was not the case with Dragos.  He cursed often and generally used modern terminology that is heard from young people.  I'm not saying this isn't possible for him to have adapted, but it caused him to lose his own voice.  He and Pia spoke nearly the same way.  I really couldn't differentiate between the two character's dialog which made the story not quite as good as it could have been.  In fact, most of the characters in the book tended to talk this way, including the other older ones.  It seemed contradictory to how they should have been.<br /><br />Despite this being a bit frustrating while reading, I did finish the book.  It had a great tale to keep the reader in suspense.  Also, the romantic scenes were very well written.  Some of the best I have seen.  This helped to keep me going even when the dialog became annoying.  For those who are a stickler for characters appearing as their nature dictates, this book may be a bit rough to get through.  On the other hand, if you enjoy the ancient guys speaking in a modern fashion, this may not bother you at all.  Everyone has their own preferences.ow they should have been.

B002ZG99J0|3.0|One could link ten other films that this is a copy of, and virtually every review here has stated just that whether it is liked or not. But the Blu is a mix of Sony & Screen Gems trying to make something out of nothing, and they both succeed and fail.<br /><br />The story follows our all-pretty-to-look-at college girls and boys as they go to school to be stalked, take showers, party and get killed - but all in a PG-13 way. The Blu clarity is excellent, even with super light backgrounds and dark clothing, even with dark showers and even with a kitten in a dryer. The sound has a nice DTS mix to it (will list that later) but the supplements were somewhat miserable:<br /><br />* Deleted & alternate scenes, 5 @ 6:09 minutes. This opening was boring (their empty dorm room and furniture), glad to see it cut. They cut out a lot of the Irene/Rebecca stuff which would have made more sense to have in the movie.<br />* Making of, 8:45 minutes. Clip heavy, talking head piece but will give the fans more of their eye candy to look at - even more so in this next fluff;<br />* Next Gen of Stars, 5:25 minutes. The entire piece is a self-congratulatory set of cuts gratuitously made from the prior interviews...yuck.<br />* Dressing dangerously, 3:47 minutes. A quip about the fashion on the set.<br />* Director's commentary. For what he has to say about the film I would say stick with the two interview supplements - as painful as that is to say.<br />* movieIQ. Definitely for the fans of these stars in case you are low on your eye candy trivia.<br /><br />What gives this one more star above the one for film and one for Blu clarity, is the amount of work put into the sound sets; 5.1 DTS for English, Portuguese, and French with 5.1 on the Spanish, but also a rare 5.1 on the DVS. Subs in same with commentary subs also - so kudos to them for getting everything subbed. Region coded A/B/C.

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|If you need \\"instant gratification\\" in your entertainment, look elsewhere...  Otherwise, prepare to revel in the slow seduction and intrigue this movie will provide.    Not a typical \\"romance\\" story, however the forces sexual tension and passion could only be held back by the presence of the immense dignity of the characters and respect they have for each other. Neither is this an action movie.... the wheels of my mind were constantly turning and I found my heart racing at times. I appreciate that it isn't so simple-minded that it can be categorized into a specific genre, I prefer have diversity in film.    A beautifully filmed movie, perfect for those who appreciate clever stories with subtle, yet powerful acting.     Just like the old days. ;)    ~ lechicklet 28/F
B0030GCZM2|3.0|Really enjoyed 3/4 of this movie, last part of plot was not consistent with the way the main character was initially developed.
B003Y5HWGI|3.0|I thought Desperate Housewives was so great the first five seasons it was on, making even a five year time jump work, but during it's sixth season it started to falter, and the seventh season was easily the worst yet with messy and uneven plot points and storylines.    Since spoilers aren't allowed in reviews, it makes it hard to be very comprehensive, but I didn't like any of Bree's or Lynette's storylines this season, and really hated the way they ended the season with Lynette, found Vanessa William's new character of Renee uneeded and forgotten about most of the time. Though Gabrielle and Susan's stories this season were slightly better, but the entirity of Gabrielle's season, which dominated the first two-thirds or so of the season, was completely forgotten and never mentioned again for the rest of the season, and her season finale ender seemed to be thrown together in a \\"what do we do with Gabrielle,\\" random way. Susan was the best of the worst, and I really liked her the last few episodes, and how it ended with the villian of the season. Also, there was no real cliff hanger that has me dying to watch the next season.    Overall the season did have a few really good episodes, but for the most part, I was very bored with this season, and I think Desperate Housewives is running out of good storylines for the ladies of Wisteria Lane.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is a fantastic sequel to the incredible Romantic masterpiece \\"Before Sunrise.\\" Upon first viewing, I was a little disappointed in the lack of romance with this one, but upon further viewings, I came to love it. It's chatty, but the dialogue is wonderful and it pulls you through. The only thing that I didn't buy was Celine's claim that she and Jesse never had sex the first time. She later recants, but it was implausible that she would have said it and that he wouldn't have just laughed at the idea. Still, I loved the ending with her singing her waltz and the ambiguous final scene.

B00457X7XQ|5.0|A well written, well narrated tech thriller. I was so impressed by the characters portrayed in the story. The novel made me realize how much we are dependent on computers these days and how much impact could be made if they go against us. I hope the DHS, NSA folks read this novel and realize that the plot told in the story is very much possible.
B0036B4ETS|4.0|I always try to buy OEM replacement parts. They are usually superior to knock-offs in terms of build quality and design. This is an OEM battery and it lasts much longer than the generic ones.  It arrived as advertised, I'd buy from them again.
0345529057|2.0|There are two different stories here. The first is an outstanding geo-political intrigue set in a fictional earth-like late dark ages world. The second is a sword-and-sorcery epic. Both feature an almost equal mix of outstanding characters and utter stereotypes. The difficulty arises when the author intertwines the two stories. This results in an almost Deus ex machina use of magic to solve the 'real world' problems and advance the story.<br /><br />The 'Song of Fire and Ice' books have ruined 'Game of Thrones' on HBO for me. The books might as well be called 'Screw you Reader, every character you like will brutalized in every conceivable manner.' I'm 1/3 of the way through the 3rd book and I'm quitting.  Maybe it is not that awful, but let's just say that the author seems to be a fan of Thomas Hobbes. The two overriding themes seem to be \\"bellum omnium contra omnes\\" and 'the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.'<br /><br />I came to the books AFTER the HBO series started. This is what might have soured my view of this book series. The first few HBO episodes were high production value thrillers. Even the Other in the opening scene wasn't implicitly supernatural in origin. It seemed like a solid period political drama, a sort of medieval Blue and the Gray/North and South/War of the Roses element. I eagerly bought the $20 value pack of the first four (all 800+ page) books and started reading.<br /><br />Even before the magic starts happening the setting is questionable. These kingdoms have been around for 5000-8000 years and they are still developmentally circa 800-1200 CE, WTH is wrong with these people?<br /><br />Then when magic starts occurring I was still willing to give it a chance because it could have been an interesting plot element. It wasn't. As I said earlier it became a crutch for an overwrought plot that doesn't seem adequately story boarded. They are only so many times you can see the same people maimed/raped/crippled/imprisoned/killed (not necessarily in that order) before the saga sours no matter how many unicorn riding-rainbow-pooping leprechauns the author pulls out of his 'hat'.<br /><br />'Magic is returning to the world' is a weak plot driver. For example, one of the more sympathetic characters is solidly downstream on the river of poop. They do an action which saves someones life. A few chapters later they meet the person they saved and that person turns out to be a real BAMF. He gives the character that saved him the equivalent of 'three wishes' in the form of certain tasks that he will perform for the person that saved him. Instead of just making the BAMF a Navy SEAL-ninja-assassin meets the Scarlet Pimpernel, he turns out to be a shapeshifter from a faraway land that gives her a 'magic coin' and phrase to use if his help is ever needed one more time.

1595826971|5.0|I played the original Alice back in the day and I was sort of hoping for a section on the graphics from the old Alice. But alas, this is a miniscule criticism and in no way diminishes my delight when I first browsed The Art of Alice. One always sort of holds their breath when anticipating a sequel...will it be bad? as good? better? I cannot comment on the video game, but the graphics are blowing me away. What I am loving in particular is the very dark Dickens-esque settings and characters. Wow. There's a little bit of steam punk, Tim Burton, I could go on... I just wanted to add two enthusiastic thumbs up to the other reviews. This is one of my favorite books I've bought this year.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The DVD case design was wonderfully dramatic. I really appreciated the symmetry of the shot. I thought that the coloring really was a nice tie-in to the darker content of the film. My only complaint is that you cannot see Ron's wand, which I found sort of demeaning.

Great cover versions by Zakk and the boys of some classic songs by Neil Young,Simon & Garfunkel and Blind Faith as well as great acoustic versions of songs from order of the black another great cd.I bought this cd the day it came out and glad I did. A must have for any fan of Black Label Society!
1405468165|4.0|I got this edition of Little Women so my 10 year old daughter and I could read it together.  Upon finishing it, nothing I recalled of reading it previously was included:  Meg's wedding, Beth dying, Laurie professing his love for Jo (who rebuffs him), Laurie's engagement and marriage to Amy.  Befuddled, I checked other editions: most editions of Little Women include BOTH Parts I AND II. So, while this edition is beautiful, with expensive, high gloss pages and beautiful illustrations, it only includes Part I.  I'd cut the publisher some slack if that was noted on the cover or title page (it isn't).  Buyer beware...if you're looking for the whole two part novel of 'Little Women', skip this edition from Paragon Publishers.

B003EYVXYG|1.0|I am also a Romero fan, but this one ,as the last couple of \\"dead\\" films, is just awful!!! Not even worth a rent. I can't believe he actually thought this film (as well as the last)is decent. I hope he stops the \\"dead\\" series. It's burnt.<br /><br />The makeup on the zombies is beyond cheap looking. The topic is bland. He tends to do \\"social\\" symbolism. Whatever. No point taken or needed. Just a bad film and I am a huge horror film fanatic.<br /><br />Pass this one. You won't regret it. Only if you watch it. I did. A waste of money, film, and time.
B004PUG7MG|5.0|I have been a fan of Avril Lavigne since 2003, so not quite the hardcore fans who were with her since the very beginning, but I do love her. I was so disappointed with The Best Damn Thing, but I still found things to love about it. The few truly mature songs on there (Innocent especially, but I also didn't think Contagious and Hot were all that bad) were pretty good. The real problem I had with it was the letdown. I loved Let Go; was crazy over Under My Skin; The Best Damn Thing was just kind of...sad. I actually felt bad for her.    I hoped with all my heart that her next CD would be better. I remember reading an article that said she was getting more and more mature with every year, and that this album would be far more mature than her third one. I was really excited!--and then What the Hell was released. That was almost as bad as the letdown of her third CD. But I still had faith.    I started listening to this album today. I will probably not stop listening to it for several weeks now. I am really, really pleasantly surprised with this. I think the only song I dislike is What the Hell. Hey, what the hell, I'll just delete it!    Please, Avril, listen to these reviews. Go back to that maturity and vocal strength of your first and second CDs. Don't sell out to the masses, enough people listen to you because you're good, and people need to listen to that goodness some more. Never stop making GOOD MUSIC, please!!

He loved it and gave it back to me to read.  I LOVED it and the nite I finished the book, I had a dream about Ruby.  I was holding her around the neck and her tail wagging and so enjoying her and shouting to everyone around me ..did they see and touch her.  Quite the dream  GREAT BOOK.  Thank you Mr. Stein.

B004H1V5RU|1.0|We are happy owners of the original Perplexus and eagerly preordered the Perplexus Epic from Amazon. We received ours on release day (May 5th, 2011) and played with it for barely a week and a half before a critical part of the track snapped off. It's a funnel that catches the ball after step 118 and without it, you simply cannot advance to step 119. The funnel was held onto the track by a very slender plastic peg which snapped off flush (see product photos for pics of the broken segment).  I've written to the manufacturer's customer support but haven't heard anything back, I'll update if they respond.     So, to sum up: great game, however there's a serious design defect within that is entirely too fragile to hold up to normal play.   -------------------------------------------------------  ETA: 5/20: Plasmacar customer service is awesome, a replacement Epic is on its way! Thank you, Susan!
159448385X|5.0|This author has the ability to place you in the events of the book. His descriptive talent is unique. Although fiction the many references to Afghanistan's history can be seen using Google Earth. Much of Afghanistan's history has since been erased by the Talibon's disregard for anything non Muslim. Thanks to Khaled Hosseini, much history has been restored if only in thought and reference.
0345522478|4.0|If you like fast-paced urban fantasy, you'll probably like this book. The action starts early and never really stops. The narrative character is a druid and you have more than enough supernatural goodies and badies to satisfy the genre requirements. Heck, there's even a telepathic dog (in a manner of speaking). I definitely came away inclined to read more of the series.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|The Tourist is certainly beautiful on the eyes.  Beautiful location, beautiful architecture, an extremely beautiful Jolie.  How all women would wish they could slide around the planet looking like that.  As for the storyline, not so bad.  You're kept in the dark right to the end, which I suppose is what will keep you watching.  As for Jolie & Depp, I felt uncomfortable watching them, to be honest.  I found their performances quite watery.  Usually a firm fan of Depp, he didn't look comfortable in this role, oftentimes coming across as quite wimpish, something akin to a wet dish rag. His character didn't come to life for me until right at the end.  The movie would have been better served with two 'not so A-List' actors.  The producers were obviously wanting a guarantee of sales.

But then again, Superman never dies.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|Atticus is many things, but the most important is that he is a Druid. The last of his kind. He is many, many centuries old - even though he only looks to be in his 20's.  Atticus is powerful and wields a sword.  A magical sword, that a Celtic god wants bad and said god will do anything to get it.<br /><br />Excellent read! Hounded is a real page turner. Every time I was gonna take a break I had to read the next chapter to see what was going to happen. A fast and entertaining tale. Atticus is a great character to spend time with. Witty, sharp as a tack. Really a bit of a bad ass, I think he could give Mr. Harry Dresden a run for his money. I loved his sense of humor (even his dog is funny) and that the book is steeped in Celtic mythology.  Looking forward to reading the next installments. Fans of this genre will eat this one up.

I still enjoy playing it until reboot and just resume playing after the phone finishes rebooting.

1932100660|1.0|A \\"China Study\\" Review    In T. Colin Campbell's \\"The China Study\\" we are told over and over again that there is \\"mountains of evidence\\" showing that a \\"whole foods, plant based diet\\" is the only way to be healthy and avoid disease.  All animal foods are condemned as being unhealthy and the cause of chronic disease.  Campbell concludes from his studies and research that animal protein is the culprit in most chronic diseases including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune diseases, and bone, kidney, eye and brain diseases.  He completely ignores the \\"mountains of evidence\\" that clearly shows that good quality animal products, from animals that have been range raised and fed their natural diet, protect us from chronic disease and are essential for obtaining our optimal health.  He emphasizes the difference between quality whole foods from plants and grains versus processed, refined carbohydrates, yet says all animal foods are unhealthy.  He fails to make the distinction between factory farmed animal products and quality animal products from range raised animals that are fed their natural diet, ie cows are designed to eat grass not grains.  He also ignores the negative impact his advised whole foods, plant based diet has on health as well as the adverse effects on the environment, biodiversity, ecosystems, and excessive fossil fuel consumption.  We are repeatedly told how many credentials and experience Campbell has, how many scientific articles he has written and awards he has received, and he condescendingly belittles anyone who questions his conclusions accusing them of being biased, unscientific and inexperienced.  Yet \\"The China Study\\" is filled with unfounded leaps of logic, biased assumptions, inconsistent facts, omissions, exaggerations, reductionism, and misunderstandings.         Campbell bases much of his conclusion, that a whole foods, plant based diet is optimal for good health and disease prevention, on his laboratory program that studied the effects of casein fed to rats and development of cancer.  Rats were fed the carcinogen aflatoxin and then fed different amounts of casein to observe the impact of this protein on cancer.  In the rats that received 20% of their diet as casein, cancer growth increased and the ones whose diet contained only 5% casein, the cancer growth was inhibited.   From this he concludes that \\"cow's milk protein is an exceptionally potent cancer promoter in rats dosed with aflatoxin.\\"   Then he makes the unfounded jump that all animal proteins are destructive to health, cause cancer and many other chronic diseases.  As Chris Masterjohn states \\"Unfortunately, Campbell projects the results of his casein-cancer research onto all animal protein--a leap he does not justify with evidence or even sound logic.\\"  \\"It seems ironic that Campbell censures reductionism in nutritional science, yet uses that very reductionism to condemn an entire class of foods (animal products) based on the behavior of one substance in isolation (casein).\\"        Campbell fails to disclose the fact that whey protein did not have the negative effect that isolated casein did.  As Chris Masterjohn points out, \\"whey protein appears to have a protective effect against colon cancer that casein does not have.\\"        The casein that Campbell fed to his laboratory rats was in an isolated, powder form (I do not know if it came from raw milk or pasteurized milk.)  Isolated, powdered casein is completely different from casein in its natural state as part of a whole raw milk food.  All of the components in raw milk work synergistically.  To conclude that isolated, powdered casein will have the same effect as whole raw milk in its natural state is unfounded.      Campbell does not tell us or does not know if the milk he used was type A1 or A2 milk.  Keith Woodford in his book \\" Devil In The Milk\\"  argues that the casein from A1 type milk, (ie from Holstein cows), has been linked to type 1 diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia in individuals with compromised digestive tracts.  (I believe the milk he used was pasteurized and not raw).  However, there were no adverse health effects from A2 type milk which comes from old fashioned cows like Jerseys and Guernseys.  The two milks have a different B-casein variant and a different amino acid at position 67.  In A1 the amino acid is histidine which forms a weak link and upon digestion, the breakdown at this weak link happens easily and releases an opioid in the gut which can lead to health problems.   Thus knowing the type of milk used in his experiment could be a very important variable that was overlooked.     Campbell also uses his \\"China Study\\" as proof that a whole foods, plant based diet, devoid of all animal foods, is the key to health.  I am not sure why his book is called \\"The China Study\\" since there is very little discussion on it in the book.  This study began in 1983 and was \\"a nationwide comprehensive study of dietary and lifestyle factors associated with disease mortality in 170 villages in mainland China and Taiwan.\\"   From this study he claims that the \\"people who ate the most animal-based foods got the most chronic disease and those who ate the most plant-based foods were the healthiest and tended to avoid chronic disease.\\"   Yet there are many problems with this \\"proof.\\"  To begin with, the China study was an epidemiologic study.  Epidemiologic studies are rife with problems and uncertainties as Lierre Keith points out, \\"...epidemiological studies can only prove correlation.  They cannot prove causality.\\"   Campbell himself admits that \\"if someone wants proof that a single factor causes a single outcome, a correlation is not good enough.\\"   He says \\"The China study has over 8,000 statistically significant correlations\\"  and because of this, he in fact does base his biased conclusions on these correlations.  We know from Ancel Keys' infamous Six Countries Epidemiologic Study how easy it is for them to be twistedand used to prove whatever one wishes.  Keys cherry picked the 6 countries out of 22 for which he had facts and statistics because these countries corroborated his hypothesis.      Another problem with the \\"China Study\\" is it based its diet information on questionnaires over a three day period.  Questionnaires are highly unreliable and a 3 day period does not seem to me to be nearly long enough to base conclusions.  Another drawback with the study, as Chris Masterjohn points out is \\"...the nutrient intakes were determined from food composition tables, rather than measured directly from foods. This disallowed any consideration of differences in nutrient composition of foods in different areas due to soil quality, which was a primary theme of Weston Price's research.\\"  and \\"...did not adequately account for the diversity of animal foods.\\"      Another project Campbell coordinated was in the Philippines and it investigated the high prevalence of liver cancer in Filipino children.   He states that the children who ate the highest-protein diets were the ones most likely to get liver cancer and that they were the children of the wealthiest families.   Children of the wealthiest families also probably consumed many refined carbohydrates and sugars yet this is not considered.    If Campbell has spent so many years studying the effect of nutrition and health, why does he completely ignore the numerous scientists and studies that clearly show that quality animal foods are essential for optimal health and prevention of chronic disease?  One of Campbell's listed \\"Principles\\" states \\"There are virtually no nutrients in animal-based foods that are not better provided by plants.   Dr. Weston A. Price came to the opposite conclusion.  He documented over and over again in \\"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration\\" that a traditional diet high in animal fats and nutrient dense animal foods and traditionally prepared foods, without white sugar, flour and highly processed vegetable oils, produced healthy, happy people with virtually no chronic disease, mental problems, birth defects, or dental cavities or malformations.  Dr George Mann, George Catlin, Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, Lierre Keith, Uffe Ravnskov, Dr. Mary Enig, Sally Fallon Morell, Dr. Tom Cowan, Kaalya T Daniel, and many more all discuss how animal foods high in fat and cholesterol contribute to health and help prevent heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.      Campbell has a complete misunderstanding of cholesterol and incorrectly thinks high blood cholesterol causes cancer and is a strong indicator of Western diseases especially heart disease.  Cholesterol plays a crucial role in the health of our entire bodies.  As Mary Enig and Sally Fallon Morell state in \\"Oiling of America\\" cholesterol \\"acts as a precursor to vital corticosteroids, hormones that help us deal with stress and protect the body against heart disease and cancer; it is a precursor to vitamin D, a vital fat-soluble vitamin needed for healthy bones and nervous system, proper growth, mineral metabolism, muscle tone, insulin production, reproduction and immune system function; it is the precursor to bile salts, which are vital for digestion and assimilation of fats in the diet.\\"   Cholesterol also acts as an antioxidant, is a healing agent and necessary for the production of serotonin.  Cholesterol is not the demon Campbell makes it out to be and is not correlated with cancer.  Blood cholesterol levels are not a reliable indicator for heart disease.   Because of this misunderstanding of the importance of cholesterol for our health, Campbell states \\"...plant-based food contain no cholesterol and, in various other ways, help to decrease the amount of cholesterol made by the body.  All of this was consistent with the findings from the China study.\\"        Campbell uses the Framingham Heart study as supporting his argument.  He tells us \\"No study has been more influential than that of the Framingham HeartStudy.\\"   However, he fails to mention that the program director William Castelli wrote in 1992 that \\"the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more calories one ate, the lower people's serum cholesterol...we found that the people who ate the most cholesterol, saturated fat, ate the most calories weighed the least and were the most physically active.\\"      Campbell also fails to point out the crucial role the fat soluble vitamins A, D and K2 play in optimal health and disease prevention.  These fat soluble vitamins, which only exist in animal foods, are necessary for the health of our bones, teeth, facial development, organs, mineral absorption, protein use, the development of our brains and nervous systems and much more.  Yet Campbell claims that \\"...we should not have our children consume diets high in animal-based foods.\\"   He writes that all the vitamin D our bodies need can be obtained from being out in the sun for brief periods of time a few times a week.  This is only true for those people living near the equator and during the midday hours during the summer in other parts of the world.  Many factors, like age, skin color, pollution, and time of year make this impossible.  He notes correctly that MS is a chronic disease that exists in higher numbers in populations the further they live from the equator.  However, instead of advocating animal foods high in vitamin D for these people, he suggests taking a vitamin D supplement instead, even though he advises against supplements earlier in the book.  One other supplement he suggests people take who are following his whole foods, plant based diet is vitamin B12 because this crucial vitamin is lacking in his suggested diet.  Doesn't that indicate that our bodies are designed to eat animal foods that naturally contain vitamin B12?      True vitamin A can only be obtained from animal foods.  Beta carotene in plant foods is a pre-cursor to vitamin A and must be converted in the body to true vitamin A. Many people, especially children, the elderly and those who have hypothyroidism, can not make this conversion at all.  Following Campbell's diet would surely lead to a vitamin A deficiency for many people.      It is interesting to note that much of the funding that Campbell received for his rat study and other studies he did looking at the relationship between diet and cancer, came from the National Institutes of Health and later the American Cancer Society, the American Institute for Cancer research and the Cancer Research Foundation of America.   The NIH also funded the Framingham study that unsuccessfully attempted to show that animal fats were responsible for heart disease.  Numerous other studies, and millions of tax dollars, have been conducted in an attempt to find good quality animal foods responsible for disease and they have failed.      Why does Dr. Campbell have such a bias against animal proteins and considers them the main culprit for disease when the more probable cause of chronic disease are sugars, grains, soy and polyunsaturated oils?  Campbell even admits the dangerous consequences of eating sugar, white flour and other processed foods.  Yet he never considers this in his argument as the main culprit in disease.  Gary Taubes, in his book Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" convincingly delineates the argument that sugars and grains are responsible for chronic disease.   Campbell repeatedly tells us that chronic disease is a symptom of Western societies because of these countries high meat consumption.  Yet he completely ignores the fact that refined carbohydrates, sugars, polyunsaturated oils and soy are also a big component of Western society diets.  In response to Campbell's allegation that animal protein causes cancer, Denise Minger comments: \\"But when we actually track down the direct correlation between animal protein and cancer, there is no statistically significant positive trend. None.\\"   Minger also states: \\"In fact, when we look solely at the variable `death from all cancers,' the association with plant protein is +12. With animal protein, it's only +3. So why is Campbell linking animal protein to cancer, yet implying plant protein is protective against it?\\"   Campbell quotes some scientists and doctors that support his point of view but fails to discuss the long list of scientists, doctors and evidence that proves his perspective is inaccurate.  What about the observations of Albert Schweitzer, Samuel Hutton, Stanislas Tanchou and John Yudkin to name a few?        Campbell states that plant proteins, including wheat and soy, do not have a negative effect and do not promote cancer growth.   He says \\"In these experiments, plant protein did not promote cancer growth, even at the higher levels of intake\\"  and that \\"The safe proteins were from plants, including wheat and soy.\\"   Does he not know about the serious health problems caused by wheat and soy?  Wheat is problematic for many individuals for many reasons.  Wheat and other grains get broken down into sugars in the body raising insulin levels and in excess and can lead to insulin resistance to name one significant problem.  They are addictive because of their opiate effect in the gut.  Denise Minger clearly shows a positive correlation with wheat consumption and many different diseases.   Wheat contains phytates which block mineral absorption in the gut.  Also, many people are gluten intolerant and thus need to avoid wheat.      Soy is full of goitrogens that depress the thyroid, phytates that block mineral absorption in the gut, isoflavones that are phyto-endocrine disruptors, trypsin inhibitors which interfere with protein digestion, phytoestrogens which disrupt endocrine function, promote breast cancer and cause hypothyroidism, and much more.   Campbell tells us to eat soy as part of a healthy diet to avoid cancer.  Denise Minger paints a different picture.  \\"Looks to me like breast cancer may have links with sugar and alcohol, and perhapsalso with hexachlorocyclohexane and occupational hazards associated with industry work. Again, why is Campbell singling out fat from animal products when other--stronger--correlations are present?\\"   He tells us of the dangers of early menarche and cancer risk  yet forgets to mention that soy fed to female babies and girls leads to early menarche.    Dr. Campbell also seems to be ignorant of the numerous phytochemicals found in plant foods.  One of these is phytic acid, discussed above, which is found in grains, nuts, seeds and legumes. He fails to discuss the importance of properly preparing grains, seeds, nuts and legumes by sprouting, soaking or lacto-fermenting, in order to neutralize the anti-nutrients found in these foods.    Cruciferous vegetables are also recommended in Campbell's diet.  Yet cruciferous vegetables can be problematic for many individuals especially if they are not prepared properly to neutralize their anti-nutrients.  This family of vegetables contains goitrogens, which depress the thyroid gland.  They are particularly dangerous if the diet does not contain enough iodine.  Cruciferous vegetables also contain nitriles.  Nitriles \\"can release cyanide into tissues and result in general toxicity at high doses.\\"          Dr. Campbell dedicates a section of his book to kidney stones and blames animal protein as the culprit.   However, plant foods seem to play a major role in the formation of kidney stones.  Kidney stones are caused by oxalates, the salt form of oxalic acid.   Oxalates combine with metals in the body to form kidney stones.  Calcium is the most common of these metals.   Oxalate crystals are produced in very high amounts by mold and fungus  and sugars and grains feed fungus like Candida in the body.  Some foods that are excessively high in oxalates are soy protein and spinach;  the very same foods Campbell suggests we eat.  Examples of other vegetarian foods that contain high amounts of oxalates are peanuts, Swiss chard, sweet potatoes, wheat germ, leeks, soy and more.       Campbell also recommends eating the nightshade plants but fails to mention that they can cause calcinosis, which is a \\"toxic calcification of soft tissues when eaten by animals.\\"   Other phytochemicals found in nightshades are solanine which is \\"a poison that can cause gastrointestinal and neurologic disorders,\\" nicotine, and capsaicin which is an \\"irritant that produces a burning sensation in tissues with which it comes into contact.\\"   More phytochemicals found in plant foods are saponins found in foods like soybeans, chick peas and other beans, have been linked to leaky gut syndrome.   Lectins found mostly in beans and grains, including soy, can \\"cause leaky gut, immune system reactions and blood clotting.\\"   Salicylates are found in a variety of fruits and vegetables like dried fruits, most berries, oranges, nectarines, grapefruit, most varieties of apples and more and they \\"can cause dilated blood vessels, constricted bronchial passages and mucus production as well as asthma, hives, nasal polyps, chronic swelling and a wide variety of gastrointestinal symptoms.\\"      Campbell's arguments and facts showing the health benefits of plant foods and their protection against disease, fail to pass the test.  For example, Denise Minger's reply to Campbell's allegation that green vegetables are protective of disease is: \\"Since only frequency and not actual quantity of greens seems protective of heart disease and stroke, it's safe to say that greens probably aren't the true protective factor.\\"   Campbell's praise of fiber also falls short.  Konstaintin Monastyrsky tells us \\"When we eat too much fiber digestion lasts longer and fermentation occurs, endangering the bacterial flora and causing problems such as bloating, flatulence and enlarged stools, leading to constipation or diarrhea, IBS and diverticular disease.\\"      Our digestive tracts are designed for an omnivorous diet.  For example, our stomachs produce hydrochloric acid for animal protein digestion.  Our digestive tracts resemble carnivorous animals and not herbivorous animals.  Do we ignore natures design to follow Campbell's advice because of his numerous credentials and awards?    Campbell is either unaware of or again, omits from his discussion, the destruction vegetarian and vegan diets do to our soils, ecosystems, environment, natural waters and the enormous amount of fossil fuels needed to grow and transport plant foods if animals are not part of the picture.  Lierre Keith paints a complete picture of this truth in her book \\"The Vegetarian Myth.\\"  Lierre Keith asks advocates of vegan diets \\"what is going to fertilize the soils that grow their grains and plant crops, fossil fuel or manure?\\"   And what about eating locally?  That means no more brown rice and seaweed for many vegetarians.      I agree with Dr. Campbell's statement \\"...that a good diet is the most powerful weapon we have against disease and sickness.\\"   I completely disagree with him on what constitutes a good diet.   I followed his recommended whole foods, plant based diet for years believing it to be good for my health.  Shortly after I began this diet, my health began to deteriorate, I gained weight and the longer I stayed on the diet, the worse I felt.  It took me a long time to realize that my whole foods, plant based diet was the culprit because everything I read told me otherwise.  I finally came across the studies of Weston A. Price and changed my diet to include lots of good quality animal foods, especially animal fats, from range raised, grass-fed animals.   I immediately felt better and eventually recovered my health.  So I don't care how many degrees Dr. Campbell has, I know empirically that my body needs quality nutrient dense animal foods in order for me to maintain my optimal weight and health.

I'm talkin' 'bout rock'n'roll.\\" But even though the \\"hard rock\\" burnouts haven't got enough gray matter left to realize it, the artist and title of this album is still the answer to why metal is nothing but noise without the blues. From driving songs like \\"Day Of the Eagle\\" through mid-string dominant laments like the title track through the rim shot/ high hat clocked sincerity of \\"In This Place\\" through heartfelt statements of love like \\"Lady Love\\" though the uptempo bass runs of \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\"--this album asks the blunt questions; Who needs speed metal--the movers here are fast enough. And who needs death metal when the broken hearted cry of the blues is the downer that you can recover from? It may be the practice of each \\"younger generation\\" to co-opt the whole definition of rock'n'roll, relegating all earlier material and artists to the realm of \\"geezer rock\\".

B0025KVLVA|5.0|I was only 4 years old when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show.  So, i missed beatlemania, instead I discovered the Beatles when i started purchasing record albums in the 1970s.  I decided to buy the British LPs because they looked more professional and mainly because they had more songs per record.  I never realized until later that I was missing out on a lot of great songs.  So, packed with singles, b-sides, and EPs, Past Masters is like a god-send and a real revelation.  Its amazing, I Want to Hold Your Hand and She Loves You are almost as exciting today as they must have been back in 1964. Many of these I had heard before -including John Lennon singing This Boy and Paul McCartney doing Long Tall Sally and I'm Down, which are highlights.  But the one song I cant get out of my head is Yes It Is.  I cant believe I had never heard this song before!  Beautiful.  The rest of disc 1 includes cover songs of the Beatles favorite 50s groups which are an absolute joy.  Its like I discovered some long lost treasure trove of Beatles which is wonderful.    Disc 2  I already had many of the songs on Disc 2 because I own the american Hey Jude LP which i guess isnt an official beatle record.  The only new songs for me are Inner Light and You Know My Name which are interesting but not all that great.  What I discovered though listening to the singles from 1965 to 1966 is revolutionary- i think!  I've always wondered what is the difference between \\"rock music\\" versus \\"rock n roll music\\" and when did it happen?  I know that all the sudden you couldnt really dance to \\"rock music\\".  Did it start with Led Zeppelin, or maybe Jimi Hendrix?  Or was it the Who- maybe Dylan's Rolling Stone?  Well, for the Beatles, in my opinion it happened between 1965's single Day Tripper and 1966's single Paperback Writer.  Day Tripper kind of invented the guitar solo/riff introduction to a rock song, but it still had that danceability, that light rhythmic melody.  Then came Paperback Writer with a much heavier drum and bass.  But mainly the guitar break was heavy duty and it sounded completely different.  So, maybe this was the Beatles transformation, aided I'm sure by mind-altering substances!  Its also interesting that you'll notice no songs on Disc 2 from the Sgt Pepper, White Album phase, although maybe those singles were just packaged as the Magical Mystery Tour.    If you're a Beatles fan, you'll absolutely love this collection.  If you're not, you will become one.
B003UESJH4|4.0|This is a well-acted bio-drama that generally deserves the acclaim it won. However the relationship between the eventual King George VI and his speech therapist wasn't always portrayed as quite the inspiring friendship that some people considered it to be. The relationship had its rocky times of course, as all relationships do. But over and above that, the two men were portrayed as spending an inordinate amount of time insisting on terms of address. \\"Call me `Your Majesty.'\\" \\"I'll call you Bertie; you call me 'Mr. Logue.'\\" \\"No, I'll call you 'Lionel'; you call me `Your Highness.'\\" And so the film went, having the two men signal their relative preferred status to each other in what seemed like a repeated chorus of Paul Simon's \\"You Can Call Me Al.\\"    Even the Queen Mother got in on the act by telling Logue's family how to address her, including a tip on proper pronunciation. All this emphasis on terms and titles seems to needlessly postpone any true friendship.    There's also the on-going distraction of the room in which Logue privately coaches the King. There's a peeling wall that dominates the room, showing the layers of decorating history that the wall has suffered. In the commentary included on this disc, the Director gloats about what a coup he scored finding this house with its distinctively deteriorating wall. He points out how framing actor Colin Firth against this wall captured his King character's frazzled, frightened, alienated state as he struggled to overcome his stammering.     Yes, that wall did make a striking visual backdrop. But it's hard to believe that the real therapist Logue would have had that kind of ruins-of-Berlin wall in his home office. So I was continuously distracted from the serious unfolding of this little-known piece of history/biography, wondering, \\"Would Logue really have conducted business in such a bizarre work space, and would the future King of England really have been so accepting of such oddly beleaguered surroundings?\\"However these are minor faults with what is overall a classically good film, a film that reminded me of the best of \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" treatments. What's more, there are many interesting extras on this DVD, including recorded excerpts of the real King George VI delivering his maiden speech with his hard-won fluency. This DVD is worth including in any film-lover's permanent video library.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Just what I'd expect out of The Rock, just what I'd want out of a movie like this, and I got it. Lots of violence, lots of action. In this case, they played it serious, not for laughs.<br /><br />Won't go into details of the plot, but Duane gets out of jail and goes all postal on the guys that killed his brother. Doesn't care who sees him. Rides off into the sunset. My only question is: Now that just about everyone in the world has seen him (on camera) kill a bunch of scumbags, aren't they still going to come after him (on America's Most Wanted)? Last time I checked, that was still illegal in most states. I'm just saying. But that little plot hole is not what this movie is about. It's about The Rock kicking butt, taking names, showing he has a heart, and finding out who is really behind it all.<br /><br />I'll admit I was a bit surprised at the plot twist at the end, though I bet half of the people watching this movie saw it coming a mile away. I don't look that far ahead. I like to be surprised. I was. Just me.<br /><br />The movie delivered. That is all I can ask. It is not something I would have paid to go see in a theater, but for a rental, it was well worth the fee. If you are into action flicks, I highly recommend it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|It is short (about 1hr) but so much fun and great puzzles.  Well worth the price, now if they would just make more games like this...
B003UESJH4|4.0|Since this was an academy award movie, I thought it was really going to suck. However, my wife wanted to check it out after seeing several scenes from it, so we rented it. Turns out it wasn't bad at all. In fact, I rather enjoyed it.<br /><br />My only beef was that it was kind of slow. However, it grew on me.<br /><br />The principle actors really got into their roles, especially Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Helena Bonham Carter. They nailed their parts. The interplay between them made me feel as if I were back in the day, so they did a great job.<br /><br />What really kept me interested in the story was the wry humor. I was expecting this to be some snooty \\"eau\\" type movie like Sense And Sensibility or something, but it turned out to keep my attention so that I wasn't drifting off to sleep halfway through it.<br /><br />There are plenty of tender moments as the future king struggles with his speech impediment and then lashes out at his therapist. His comments could really sting, and it had to hurt Rush's character, though he seemed to take it on the chin. It's amazing that in real life those two became close friends and remained so for the rest of their lives. I really liked seeing that little coda at the end of the movie.<br /><br />I usually hate academy award movies, but this one is an exception. It was quite enjoyable and though it is a bit slow, it grew on me and I'm glad I watched it. I'd never go to a theater to see it, but it makes for a good one-time rental. Highly recommended.
B001DF68MA|4.0|Purchase made in March 2011.  The WeeRide child bike seat is light weight, easy to install.  We haven't used the head rest because he's more engaged in the riding.  My husband manages to get him in the seat & mount the bike, I'm not so good at that maneuvering, I need assistance.  My 11 year old pretty much installed the seat by himself, other than some tightening of screws.  It's good value for the price you pay, which is 3 times less than the co-pilot-especially for strapping in a 1 - 3 yr old, after that, they pretty much are ready to biking themselves.  It's very secure and the size is pretty good - our kid is a little bit chunky & short but he fits the seat well.
B000KIPD5E|4.0|I bought this pedal to replace a Boss LS-2 which I moved from my home studio setup to my pedalboard.  Obviously, the Boss unit is much more versatile and can do all sorts of things which the Behringer unit cannot.  With that said, if all you need is a simple A/B switch with level controls, this may work for you.  My only complaint about the Behringer pedal is that there is a fair amount of white noise on the inactive channel.  In other words, if line A is active, you'll hear white noise which is coming through from the B channel.  For my setup it's not a concern because both channels are going into a mixer and I always turn down the inactive channel as a matter of course.  The noise might be a problem, however, in a live setup.  Note that it's only really noticeable when you're not playing.  By the way, this is the only Behringer pedal I've used which has had a noise issue.  Overall, this pedal works for me but there are quieter and more versatile A/B boxes out there, like the LS-2.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Since this application became available last year I have been using it regularly to make educated decisions about what I buy in the local stores and what I buy on-line. It also provides me with the invaluable knowledge of the Amazon rating system that we all feed with our comments.<br />I'm not going to add a bunch of pro's and con's here about the current version. We should reserve those for the feedback tool that the Amazon developers have.<br /><br />I will just add that the barcode scan and the photo recognition tools work phenomenal and the query is very quick. So, whether you grabbed something at The-X-store and want to see how good it is because it caught your eye, or if you are sure you want it, but you are concerned abut the price, this application will very likely help you decide what to do about it.
B00303GM60|5.0|To be upfront,  I didnt buy this from Amazon,  I got it from the official store of the band.  Just wanted to let people know if you like Porcupine Tree,  you will love this,  red in color and simply beautiful to look at and plays wonderful.  I have had this on cd for 5 years or so and never played it other the the first 4 songs or so.  Just finished playing all sides of the vinyl and am simply blown away!   Must own for Tree lovers!   Reviewing it here because I couldn't find a way to do it on the other site.  Has more of an electronic sound to it but still early Tree all the way.  Steven Wilson is a genius!
0307477479|4.0|I was leary of starting this book because so many reviews called it \\"postmodern\\" and \\"wildly intellectual\\" and all those fancy things... I expected paul-auster-meets-barthelme and I dreaded the mental exercise. But this book turned out to be fun and entertaining and engaging. It was smart with regard to its writing, but not so much its ideas. Minus one star for the depictions of the \\"future\\" which seemed forced and kind of silly. Also, the plot itself seemed hokey in spots: coincidences abound. Still, a very good book, but not a fantastic one. One week after I'm done with it, thinking back on it doesn't particularly move me, but I had a great time while reading it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow! This book was so very different from others and I LOVED it!!! I could not put it down. Something different to the very end of the book. I hope he writes this kind of book in the near future.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|I must preface this by saying Ive loved fleet foxes for sometime now. I remember seeing them in Philly 3 years ago for $12 and there might have been fifty people there, tops. And since them Ive gone from trying to tell everybody about them to kind of getting sick of how they are everywhere, I cant blame them, it just kind of odd how things take like 2 or 3 years for the general public to accept them.    That being said I was greatly looking forward to sitting down and really listening to this album. I did so about three times in a row and quite frankly wasn't impressed. There is no real cohesion to the album, it just goes from one song to another song, and so on. There is also no real standout tracks here. They are all pretty mediocre. I see they've tried alternate instrumentation in a few places and robin pecknold does a couple different things with his voice. All in all it sounds like songs they left off the last album because they weren't that good, or just a robin pecknold solo effort. That is the way sophomore syndrome works, you spend your whole life writing your first album and about a year or two writing the second. I will eagerly await for their triumphant return to form.
0525422943|5.0|This novel is beautiful and heart-warming! Sad at times then hilarious. I won't include any spoilers, but I DEFINATELY RECCOMEND!!! But don't read this until you've read \\"If I Stay\\" or you won't understand it.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Always read reviews but this is first time I am writing a review. I had to. I don't know where to start... The storyline, direction, acting, stunts and above all the roman era is mind-blowing. I have seen something like this before. Beautifully made!!! I watched the whole season on a single day. Couldn't resist.  Will watch it many more times... Hope they keep making more!!! Thank you.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Love this CD! I know all the songs because each one is unique but good in itself. Nightmare of course is fantastic but the others are all good lyric wise and musically also. A must have for an A7X Fan :)
B00000K3D4|1.0|Dear hapless, oblivious person who is about to watch this terrible movie,  I don't want to discourage you from watching it; apparently a sizable chunk of people like it (or are on drugs; or have a sick, twisted sense of humor), and you may indeed enjoy this film.  I did not. I thought it sucked big-time. The acting sucked, the singing sucked, the costumes were sickening, the music sucked the...yeah, it sucked.  Once, I was like you; a cheery, naive sort looking for an interesting movie to watch with my family and, hey, the title and premise don't sound bad at all. I was like, \\"Hmm, who's David Bowie?\\"  \\"'Boo-ee,'\\" my mother corrected me, \\"Not 'Bow-ee'.\\"  So, curious, I picked it up from the library and watched it.  While I'm not likely to burn it or rip my eyeballs from my head and puncture my eardrums to ensure that I never experience this movie again, I won't be getting it from the library or, indeed, buying it anywhere. If I can avoid it, I will.  So again, you will probably like it, but I really should have listened to the one-star reviews and stayed the .... away
B0045U9WPU|5.0|This dystopian love story was truly great. I loved every minute of it, even if it did make me cry. This story really scared me... can you imagine living in a world where love is a DISEASE? I think it was really eye opening to how lucky we really are.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It's brilliant that the normal DVD comes with deleted scenes now. Good quality and Bill Nighy played the role of Rufus Scrimgeour perfectly!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I've been seeing nothing but rave reviews for this book since its release date. I've only read one other \\"dragon\\" book so I was a little hesitant to read this one. But I trust my peeps and I knew they wouldn't steer me wrong.<br />Pia is half-human, half-wyr. She is blackmailed by her skeezy ex-boyfriend to steal from Dragos', head of the Wry demesnes, hoard. Dragos is an ancient dragon shape-shifter. He is very powerful and no one dares to cross him. Pia is on the run for her life after stealing from the ancient dragon. She seeks refuge with the help of her employer, Quentin, but she doesn't stay hidden for long. Dragos manages to locate her and demands revenge. Only when he comes face-to-face with Pia, exacting his punishment is no longer his top priority.<br /><br />*takes deep breath* I absolutely LOVED this book!!!! OMG! It lived up to the hype like you wouldn't believe! Every character in Dragon Bound was awesome! Thea Harrison knows how to write smart, funny and engaging characters. After just one scene with Pia, I was panting after Quentin. I hope we get to see more of him in future books. But I digress. The entire time I was reading Dragon Bound, I couldn't contain my excitement. Dragos is one of the best PNR heroes that I've read in a long time. We all have our favorites (Bones, Raphael, Barrons) and Dragos ranks right up there with them. He is intense, powerful, demanding. He is so old that he doesn't understand the modern world when it comes to niceties and emotions. In that aspect he reminds me of Raphael from Nalini Singh's Guild Hunter series. He barks orders and expects them to be followed - without question. I loved how Pia taught him that saying \\"please\\" goes a long way. Dragos had a hard time adding that tiny six letter word at the end of his requests. And his struggle with it was endearing and funny.<br /><br />Dragos and Pia are a perfect match. Once she realizes that Dragos won't be killing her - yet - she's not afraid to put him in his place. I love her sense of humor and sarcasm. Pia is a strong heroine. She's not afraid to speak up and not let Dragos run her life without having any say. The attraction between them is intense. As they soon discover, there's something bigger brewing and that Pia being sent to steal from Dragos is about more than just her ex-boyfriend covering his gambling debts. There's a big bad out there who is after Dragos - The Dark Fae King. Dragos is no longer a threat to Pia; he's now her protector. He realizes that she is his and that it is his job to keep her safe.<br /><br />\\"I don't know.\\" That fierce, proud face was puzzled. \\"All I know is you're mine to keep and protect. You can't fade away, and you can't die. I won't let you.\\"<br /><br />OMG is he fantastic or what? I can even forgive him for his dislike of Twizzlers, my favorite candy. Dragos is surrounded by great characters that work for him at Cuelebre Enterprises. Rune is his \\"First\\" but my favorite is Graydon. He is funny, sexy and was a great friend to Pia when Pia was trying to come to terms with how quicky her life was changing. I loved that Graydon calls Pia \\"cupcake.\\" I am a sucker for cute nicknames.<br /><br />Dragon Bound was a fantastic read. It has all the elements that make it a perfect PNR; sexy hero, world building, great side characters, strong heroine and a great romance. Dragon Bound is *heavy* on the romance and I love that! Great pace, wonderful storyline, fantastic dialog and some sexy that made you quiver, Dragon Bound had it all. I couldn't put the book down. I couldn't read fast enough but I didn't want it to end. As the book got closer to the end, I loved it even more. All I can say is, I am a sucker for those type of endings. I'm not going to say or hint at what it was cause it would be a big a-- spoiler and that's not how I roll. LOL!<br /><br />I can't wait to continue with this fresh, fantastic new series. If you haven't read Dragon Bound you are truly missing out. I can honestly say it is one of my favorite reads of the year.

1936719010|5.0|Prior to reading 'Do The Work', I had never heard of Steven Pressfield, or any of the books he had published. It was pure coincidence coming across this book. But I am grateful that I had. It took me a day to read, simply because I couldn't put it down. His ideas and philosophies are very basic and common knowlege, yet we forget to apply these principles when we need to. This book was very motivational and was exactly what I needed to read! Highly recommend it!
B002VJ0576|1.0|I'm a fan of steampunk. Almost all kinds of steampunk. So a well-executed steampunk retelling of Sherlock Holmes is something that I would normally look forward to...<br /><br />... unless it was from the Asylum, peddlers of cash-in abominations like \\"Transmorphers\\" and \\"Almighty Thor.\\" Yeah, I made a noise like a strangled squeaky toy when I saw that.<br /><br />So guess what kind of quality you get in \\"Sherlock Holmes,\\" which tries to spice up the canonical Holmes mythos with a \\"lost\\" tale of robots, dinosaurs, dragons and a giant octopus. The ridiculous sci-fi elements might have actually been entertaining if the acting weren't wretched, the story weren't as holey as moth-eaten lace, and it had a decent Sherlock.<br /><br />The story is told by a dying Watson during the Blitz: strange animals like a giant octopus and a very small T-rex are popping up around England, and Holmes decides that they must be artificial (since the T-rex stole mechanical components).  Somehow this ends up leading them to the Victorian urban legend Spring-Heeled Jack, a person very close to Holmes whose revenge scheme may destroy all of London.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is painful to watch, all the more so because it actually could have been fun in a stupid way if a FEW things had been done right. The entire premise is a ridiculous hodgepodge of everything the Asylum thought would be \\"cool\\" -- monsters, robots, Spring-Heeled Jack, and a steampunk \\"Iron Man.\\" And, well, it could have been fun.<br /><br />Buuuuuttt.... they do everything spectacularly wrong. The direction and cinematography are pretty clumsy and sometimes amateurish, the comic relief is PAINFUL, and the story is brain-meltingly stupid (so... Holmes somehow kept the entire story a closely-guarded secret, even though it involves ships, factories and PARLIAMENT being destroyed by robot monsters?!).  And since this is the Asylum, the monsters are about as convincing as Chinese street dragons, but less fun to watch.<br /><br />But the biggest problem by far is Ben Syder. Who is Ben Syder? Well, you probably have never heard of him, because this is his first, last and only role in ANYTHING. And I can't imagine a LESS convincing Sherlock Holmes. Syder is short, weedy, thin-voiced, hyperactive and completely lacking in charisma, like an annoying cousin who keeps dragging you into bad situations.<br /><br />For some reason, Dominic Keating and Gareth David Lloyd -- both of whom have been in other movies and TV -- are stuck as the perpetually exasperated Watson, and the sleek Thorpe Holmes (yes, a Holmes brother we never heard of). Both look pretty miserable, and neither really tries that hard.<br /><br />This \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" movie is probably the only one in existence that makes Guy Ritchie's look subtle and faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writings. It could have been fun steampunk schlock, but is too pitifully inept to manage it.ho is Ben Syder?

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Not a movie for the very young children. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope they don't wait too long to put the second half out.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|When Pearl Jam put out this 2006 untitled record, many people(mainly pretentious ones) hailed it as a return to the \\"old\\" Pearl Jam. That's misleading, because they've got a dramatically different sound than they did back in the early 90s. However, they must have thought that it was time to just play simple, good ROCK instead of continuing to experiment in ways that would totally make them suck. And partially due to Eddie's worn but highly resonant vocals, the band succeeds here. Whether they're playing punk-infused hard rock, acoustic ballads, or some mix of the 2 styles, they come up with music that's hardly revolutionary but successfully whips the tar out of any mainstream hard rock band playing today. All this results in Pearl Jam's 3rd best album overall after Yield and of course Ten. Vitalogy and Vs were just a little bit too inconsistent I thought    I could speak in further generalities about the highlights and sound ever more like some critical god, but I'd miss a lot, so I'll do a track-by-track analysis for this one.    Life Wasted-Straightforward blues-infused punk-ish hard rock whose opening chords echo the surf sounds of fellow Seattlites Mudhoney. There's a wicked classic rock styled solo towards the end of the track. Also has a quiet bridge part with good drumming, but otherwise does little. Overall however, Pearl Jam couldn't have picked a better opener.    Worldwide Suicide - Both more blatantly punk and more catchy than \\"Life Wasted\\" but without the Mudhoney influences. The rhythm's quite generic, but is really cool. The first single from the record    Comatose-Again, this song echoes Mudhoney, but sounds a little more like \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" The song's kinda weak, but Eddie's snarling puts a voice on this track.    Severed Hand - A Riot Act outtake. Probably why it had this experimental intro and a more complex song structure than other tracks on this record. Sonically,it fits better here. The rhythm's a ripoff of \\"Porch\\" but that's okay, because this a is a vast improvement.    Marker in the Sand - Stats out with a somewhat weak rhythm that's saved when  th melodic chorus starts, and Eddie's voice takes over. Also has Cameron's best drumming on the record.    Parachutes - A simply beautiful acoustic song penned by McCready that's far better than that boring mess known as \\"Just Breathe\\" from their latest, it's capped by Eddie singing in his tenderest rasp. Somewhat surprisingly, he retains a natural ability to dive into a falsetto which he does in a couple of spots.    Unemployable - A track which proves PJ still capable of some diversity. They start out with some misleading downtuning which turns into what I think of as the \\"sexy\\" rhythm of confidence. Capped by a warmly melodic chorus.    Big Wave-The first song written by Ament on the record. A ripoff of Worldwide Suicide, essentially. Not totally skippable but no real hooks. While it quiets down and adds mild distortion toward the end along with a simply climbing McCready solo, it screams half-written. Better than Jeff's other song I suppose(Edit:Actually, this song's still cook regardless. The trailing off's still annoying, though)    Gone - One of my personal favorites. Featuring good lyrics from Vedder and an highly effective switch from quiet verse to loud chorus. Eddie's really into it here. This was also released as a single.    Life Wasted Reprise- One of the acoustic interludes that started back in the No Code days. Not sure what to say about other than it works.    Army Reserve - Jeff's second musical contribution, the funk-influenced country-type rhythm is the only track that owes a certain debt to early 90s Pearl Jam. Except that it's got more maturity to it. Like Big Wave, it doesn't feel very passionate, and seems kind of half-written.    Come Back-An Eddie/Mike co-write, it's another moving acoustic track with heavier drums and a more country-influenced as compared to folk style than \\"Parachutes\\".     Inside Job - Another Eddie/Mike co-write. Has an intro not unlike Severed Hand, but with the bass more emotional but not quite so low along with added keys. Doesn't really get started for a while, but turns into a strong melodic rocker about halfway through. I'm not sure if it's the atypical song structure or Eddie's exuberance at the end, but this would have to be my personal favorite. Unsurprisingly, it's a song about conquering your demons and moving on. The lyrics aren't brilliant, but they avoid the cliched phrases used in every other hard rock song about the same subject.      So there you have it. Pearl Jam chooses a (largely) simple rock approach that sounds quite modern and really not 90sish at all, but still unlike their many imitators. Some tracks may not be as good as others, but none are really so bad that I can't give this less than a 5.  A solid record from veteran rockers at the top of their game.(wait, now I am sounding like a critical god! Sheesh)

Marty and Doc have made several trips both into the past and future, but the time machine (a DeLoren) is acting up. While trying to get back to 1985 from the year 1955 the DeLoren is sent into 1885 with Doc.<br /><br />Marty still needs to get back to 1985 so he goes to see the Doc of 1955. Doc wrote Marty a letter in 1885 saying that he burried the DeLoren so 1955 Doc and Marty dig it up, but while doing so find a tombstone saying that Doc died in September of 1885 (shortly after he wrote the letter to Marty.)<br /><br />Marty then decides that instead of going back to 1985 he will go to 1885 to make sure that Doc does not die. While there Marty and Doc deal with an ancester of Griff's who is even worse than Griff, as well as Clara-a teacher who Doc falls in love with.<br /><br />A very intersesting conclusion to a great trilegy.
0393072231|4.0|I bought this book to read for one of my economics classes. Having no economic background whatsoever made the book a little hard to understand, however once I looked up some specific terms and understood how they related to the situation, the book became interesting and incredulous. It helped me understand the concepts of how the housing bubble occurred and made our current economic situation so terrible, in addition to how incredibly stupid it is that it happened now that we look back and see how it happened. If you have an economic background this book should be an easy read, but if you do not try looking up some of the terms you do not understand, and in the end you'll me as amazed and baffled at how we let everything get so bad as I was!
B004KPLVV8|5.0|The movie is still great to watch nearly 30 years after its theatrical release. I am amazed by cult following.
B001N26GFC|1.0|Mike Leigh has made some fine films-esp.Vera Drake & Naked, but this is not one of them. The lead character is just too annoying! Other reviews state this and for me it is the kicker for making it unwatchable.
B003UESJHO|1.0|We sat through the entire nearly two hours of this, waiting for it to develop into more than a bunch of low-lifes throwing insults and fists at each other. We were disappointed.     The film offers an up close view of the incredibly depressing life of a bunch of losers in Lowell, MA, one of whom eventually manages to make it big. And, oh yeah, there were a few boxing scenes thrown in there. But there were no characters you'd be interested in enough to care about what happens to them. When the end credits rolled, my only thought was 'so what'?    Judging by the high ratings many other reviewers gave this, my opinion is apparently in the minority.  The only thing I can think of that might explain this is different attitudes toward dialog. So, if your idea of a clever, inspired script is one where the f-bomb gets dropped every 30 seconds or so, add another star to my rating.
0786868724|5.0|The book Have A Little Faith was a true story written by Mitch Albom. Mitch grew up in NJ before moving to Detroit for college, where he eventually became married and settled in Detroit. He is a Detroit sports writer with a gift for story telling. Have A Little Faith is one of several books written by this author and is appropriate for any age. There isn't any bad language, graphic scenes, or sexual in the windows at all. The main reason why I love this book is because Mitch never preaches about what faith a person should have, or what religion is right or wrong. Instead, he writes about a true story of an African American Christian Pastor in Detroit, a Jewish Rabbi from NJ, and how both men taught him about God, faith, and hope.   Mitch speaks of his personal relationship with the two men and the lessons they have taught him.  Mitch started visiting a local church whose Pastor is a reformed drug addict and ex convict. During a trip to NJ when Mitch wanted to visit his parents, his childhood Rabbi asked Mitch to one day write his eulogy, and even though Mitch was reluctant, he agreed. Mitch ends up having to travel back and forth between Detroit, his home, and NJ, where he grew up. This is when you really learn about all 3 men and their character, and how their faith changed them. Even though the Pastor is Christian, the Rabbi is Jewish, and Mitch is caught somewhere between, and you see how different these two worlds are, you also learn how these three men have more in common than you think.   In a time where the news only brings sadness, and the papers write about gossip and death, Mitch's book was a breath of fresh air. It gives hope to those who feel lost and sense of purpose to those questioning life. A powerful paragraph in the book that Mitch wrote was \\"In the beginning, there was a question. In the end, the question gets answered. God sings, we hum along, and there are many melodies, but it's all one song-one same, wonderful, human song. I am in love with hope.\\" (p. 249) That is what it comes down to for each person. Hope. It doesn't matter what our differences are. We all need hope to get through each day. We all just need a little faith.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Well, I thought they could go no further with this tale after \\"Toys Story 2\\", but the imaginators at Pixar weren't quite done with this one yet.   15 years after the world first met Woody(Tom Hanks), Buzz(Tim Allen), and the gang, we find out what will subsequently happen when Andy(John Morris) does go to college and decide the fate of his beloved childhood playthings.   Andy's Mom(Laurie Metcalfe) and sister, Molly(Beatrice Miller) are dealing with this rite of passage, helping him decide what to take, and what to leave behind.   In the meantime, Andy's toys, which have been neglected for a considerable amount of time, are desperately stooping to subterfuge just to get Andy to pay attention  to them and even to just hold them again after so many years.   We learn that some of the family have departed--the penguin, Wheezy and Woody's beloved Bo Peep having been lost to new owners in yard sales.The precious play things have been forced to regroup, and have adapted sufficently to the situation by now, but are still confined to a box. Woody, however, may be slated to go to college with his owner.Anticipating  that they will be discarded rather than given away, the little green soldiers(with R. Lee Ermey as their sergeant) depart.   But soon the group, including Jessie( Joan Cusack), Mr. Potato Head(Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head( Estelle Harris)Slinky, (Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney), the three Aliens( Jeff Pidgeon),Bullseye(Frank Welker), Hamm(John Ratzenberger), and Rex(Wallace Shawn) mistakenly end up at a daycare center, where they encounter Stretch the Octopus(Whoopi Goldberg), Molly's former Barbie doll(Jodi Benson) who was intended for the nursery school, Barbie's dim-witted clothing fanatic counterpart, Ken(Michael Keaton),Big Baby,Chuckles the Clown(Bud Luckey) and last but not least, the intially friendly but eventually sinister Lots-O-Huggin' Bear(Ned Beatty).   The new arrivals are overwhelmed by the onslaught of small children, and ask to be placed in the room with the slightly older charges. But the menacing Lotso refuses and through means of intimidation plans to keep them in their place.    Having left one eye behind at Andy's house. Mrs. Potato head discovers that their arrival at the nursery school was  a mistake, and eventually, after some misgivings, conspire to return home. A temporary separation from the gang results in Woody's encounter with a young charge named Bonnie, (Emily Hahn) who takes him home, and places him in her room with Trixie, the toy Triceratops(Kristen Schaal),the porcupine Mr. Pricklepants(Timothy Dalton) and the purple-haired Dolly(Bonnie Hunt).   Chuckles explains how and why Lotso came to be the twisted character that he became, and despite having the toys under marshall law in the afterhours , and some potentially harrowing experiences, we know Andy's toys will always find a way back to their owner, and that anyone who stands in their way will end up where they do not want to be.   In watching this, I have recalled how a girl I once babysat thought her Ken Doll was stupid, and I wonder if my now-grown former charge had a hand in making this film. But Ken's shortcomings, and support from allies such as the Chatter Telephone(Teddy Newton)--a toy I had when I was young,  combine to tip the balance in the toys' favor. We even learn along they way, that Buzz has a Spanish mode(Javier Fernandez Pena)!   If Andy only knew what his toys went through to stay with him over the years!   Well, all good things must come to and end, and this tale  deals with the realities of growing up, and moving on, with one last fling with friends for old time's sake. As the trilogy gently reaches its poignant conclusion which can make grown men mist over, we leave this beloved ensemble in very good hands.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|The finished, final film is really fun.  It actually is not as good as the theatrical version, but still really interesting to see how it all comes together.  I was extremely satisfied.  I wish all my favorite movies were available this way.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|These are terrific documentaries at any resolution, but I bought them largely because I want to fill out my Blu-Ray library, and I want discs that I will watch more than just a few times.  I have a 55-inch 1080P TV, and the images are just spectacular.  You can really get lost in the moment when the pictures are that clear.      I bought Life for my young daughters, who love nature programs.  Luckily, they are not too put off when one part of nature kills and eats another part of nature, but even if they were, there is still so much more in these documentaries that it would be worth jumping over the gory parts if you had to.      This is definitely worth picking up.  You will certainly get more viewing pleasure out of this than the two or three movies you could otherwise buy.
B004XUD762|5.0|Yet another masterpiece from Zakk Wylde and BLS! Songs from Order Of The Black redone unplugged combined with extra tracks only released internationally makes this album absolutely KILLER. The guitar solo on Overload at 3:25 is insane and a powerful rendition of Bridge Over Troubled Waters hits you right in the heart. There is nothing that can't be accomplished by the master himself, Mr. Zakk Wylde!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Who wants to see young anakin in the end of Jedi? When I saw that I almost vomited, I could't imagine watching it on full HD. It's so bad a loved franchise like star wars has been damaged so greatly over the years.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I especially loved the review of your YENTL by Singer.  So male!!  I'm living it all since 2003 when I joined a coed Talmud discussion group.  Now I appreciate the cdrom The Trope Trainer Deluxe V.5 even more. Our electronic Torah Scroll.  It takes the Talmud discussion to really understand the Pope's Bible and the Quran. On top of it all, last month discovered Sura 3:3.
0553386794|5.0|I just started reading this series at the beginning of the year. A Game of Thrones was my first book ever in the fantasy genre.<br /><br />This book was phenomenal and a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. Although, there are a ton of characters, there is someone for everyone to root for. A great bunch of story lines. All I can say is, I'm hooked and I bought the second book, A Clash of Kings and love that one too.<br /><br />Definitely check it out!!!
B00005JLKB|3.0|I'm so torn on this show. It's got every cliche high-school storyline in the world in it. Plus it has a monster of the week thing going on, like Buffy only not as clever. And the dialog...is not great.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's SUPERMAN. And I can't resist Superman. Anything Superman related I'm drawn to. It's just how I'm wired. He was the original superhero in my life and he'll always hold that mantle. So I enjoyed this show. It was an interesting take on Supe's landing here on earth as well as a fun take on some interesting questions. Like, if Clark Kent grew into his powers, what exactly happens on the day he first stumbles onto his heat vision?<br /><br />There is also one other plus here, and it's a major one. Clark Kent and Lex Luthor are cast as friends during this time period and Lex is portrayed as someone who has yet to grow into his destiny. He has a horrible father and he's a few years older and running his own business, but Lex is basically a decent person. That's a pretty good twist and it provided enough meat to get me through season one easily.<br /><br />So, yes, it's 90210. But it's 90210 with SUPERMAN!
1589795474|3.0|I basically believe in the few points that are made in this book, but this is not one of the best books I have ever read on investing or even about financial behaviors of people. The good part is that much of what is said is just pure common sense. However:  1. If you believe you can get rich quick or want to spend all of your income and blame someone else for your economic failure, you are more likely to walk away thinking, \\"yeah, if you want to be a tight wad who doesn't enjoy life...\\". It is unlikely that this drawn out discussion will change your mind.  2. There are really only 2 or 3 points this book makes, but, hating to repeat what so many others have said, it gets repeated over and over so many times that you're more likely solve your problems with insomnia than any issues you may have with money.   3. And while I believe the concept of living below your means, saving and investing, I do not believe the data presented here always supports the conclusions that the authors make. And unless I am reading the numbers wrong, they sometimes seem to be conflicting between different places in the book. For example, in one section comparing 2 doctors, one PAW has a low concern for government spending/federal deficit, while the UAW doctor has a high concern. Several pages follow with the authors' theories on why this is the case. Then later in the same chapter, they show that in a larger population, 88% PAWs have a moderate or high concern for this issue compared to 78% of the UAWs.  4. The data is very outdated, it would be more interesting to shave off at least half of the original writing and pull in more current data and analysis, including how well the authors' conclusions hold up since the several market crashes and economic downturns that have occured since the book was written.

B004HY3BTC|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Short Circuit movies, I just like movies about robots.  Make no mistake, the star of the two Short Circuit movies is Johnny Five, the robot.  Not only does Johnny Five come to life, the movie also comes to life when he enters it.  Johnny Five's dialogue is hilarious.  I'm glad the second film is finally available on Blu-ray.  The picture looks very good, better than the DVD, but not as good as others I have seen from the 1980's.  It is worth the upgrade if you are a fan.
B0006JGFNQ|3.0|Fue un regalo para mi hija de 5 años. Esta feliz con su gizmo. El juguete cumple pero a traves de tantos años de haber sido creado podria tener muchas mejoras. El material y el acabado del producto que recibi deja mucho que desear, pues tenia mucho pegamento fuera del area del peluche, tuve que limpiarlo con un solvente yo mismo, le falta calidad al producto, pero al momento funciona perfectamente y mi hija esta feliz que es lo que me importaba.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Alice in Wonderland and Blu-ray, a match made in Heaven.  As usual, Disney does a great job restoring one of their classics for Blu-ray.  The colors really pop and there is hardly any graininess.  I wish Disney didn't charge so much for their movies, but have to admit you are getting your money's worth for this release.  It is definitely worth the upgrade to Blu-ray.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is not called a classic for nothing. i have not seen this movie in years, and i just recently watched it. i was still memorized on how good this movie is. i love this movie. this is one of disney's best movie. i do have to say this, Disney does not make'm like this anymore. i would like to see disney do another hand drwan movie. But still disny movie are great. Three Cheers for the little mermaid.  If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. p.s. disney can't make bad movies
B001JNNE64|5.0|What more can be said about this classic?  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The direction, acting, sets, music, ALL superb.  The Director's Cut stretches the length to neary 3 hours but it goes by quickly.  It looks and sounds great on Blu-ray and if you're a fan you should upgrade from DVD.  The use of Mozart's music set to certain scenes of the film is superb (like every time the mysterious masked man appears).  The scenes of the operas are amazing.  For a film about the demise of one of our greatest composers there is a surprising amount of humor as well.  Movies don't get better than this.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|this is a great soundtrack, it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this cd are all of them
B001U6YI92|5.0|If you're a Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood fan you will love this film on Blu-ray.  It looks great for a 40+ year old film.  It isn't perfect, some graininess here and there, and some scenes look better than others, but it is still overall a step up from DVD.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|this is a great movie. i love this movie. the story and the voice acting is great. the characters are well made. all in all this is a great film. fun for the whole family. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B002DKGWSE|5.0|If you want to be scared out of your wits and tremble with anticipation as to what is going to happen next \\"The Last House on the Left\\" delivers this and even more. Probably the best psychological thriller I have seen in years, the movie deals with a deranged convict who, along with his co-horts, terrorizes a family at a summer house. The difference between this thiller and others in the same vein is that the victims refuse to be victims, but instead fight back for survival.<br /><br /> Garrett Dillahunt, who plays the crazed maniac, steals the film with his look of rage and his terrifying voice, but all in all the performances are first-rate and the production flawless. The movie itself is a remake of the 1972 film of the same name, but it is far better due to the wonderful production values due to today's movie making. The film ultimately made over $45,000,000 at the box office making it a financial hit.<br /><br /> The DVD comes with deleted scenes and an inside look featurette.
0525423273|5.0|This was an outstanding novel that I enjoyed.  Once I started reading, I was hooked and couldn't put it down.  It was romantic and charming.  Paris was described beautifully and majestically.  Right from the beginning, I liked Anna and her personality.  Her witty humor was entertaining and realistic.  Etienne was charming and affectionate, which I absolutely LOVED. The other characters also had strong personalities and were fully developed.  Stephanie Perkins' is a magnificent writer who I now adore.  This book was amazingly romantic and flawlessly written.     I WANT MORE!  I really hope she writes a sequel to this book about Anna and Etienne's college years and future together.  This is one of my favorite books and the #1 book I have read so far this year.  I look forward to reading Perkins' future novels and hopefully a sequel to this book!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|It's unusual for me to keep reading a series of books, but I have made an exception for the Outlander books.  The writing is great (and I love it that I have to look up a few words in every book).  The characters are endearing.  Great fun!
B003MWHVLY|5.0|I have other Sia cd's and have really enjoyed everything she has done, but this is the best yet.  From the first melody of \\"we are born\\" to the closing bars of \\"i'm in here\\" the music is a delight. Sia is truly a great songstress and songwriter. Her style is uptempo, the music will put a smile on your face and for me at least, I was keen to learn the word so I could sing along.  Love it!!
0316113506|5.0|this is a great read, of course keeping an objective view but very interesting and could possibly change your life!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I'm glad the girls got all together for another movie.  I miss the show so much.  They set off for an adventure of a life time.  The fashion was to die for as always.    Good chick-flick  Ginia
B004SC8YH2|3.0|Christopher Cross fans eager to hear something new from that voice from a time long ago won't be disappointed.  But that album cover is a total rip off from Roger Daltrey: One of the Boys.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I loved this movie, cried I laughed so hard in a few parts. If your a hard core johnny depp fan this is a MUST. All around just fantastic, just buy the dvd you wont regreat it.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I had my doubts about this set at first, since the cover is much worse than the two trilogies separate, and a penny more.  But after seeing that it may have more bonuses, and possibly the chance to see deleted and alternate scenes, it may just be that we can see Han shoot first in HD.  Maybe it won't be in the movie, but it will be on the disc.    Also the chance to see the deleted scene on Hoth where C3P0 actually does something and leads some troopers to their doom.
B0050XFXT0|5.0|This was a great episode! Explains Doctor relationship with the Tardis in a new way. The way they did it is just genius! One of my favorite episodes with Matt Smith so far. =)
B00338QENI|4.0|This is definitely a book worth reading; however, I felt that it should have been drawn to an end earlier.  Some of the time spent on Henrietta's daughter dragged a bit.  Other than that, I would have given it a five-star review.
B00509OFE8|5.0|Hopefully, SG-U will come out of its stasis earlier than three years from now.  It's true that the first season started slow, but I think that, for the most part, it has gained depth and momentum within the last year.  Right now, unfortunately, there are not too many Syfy series that have the ability to inspire people to want to learn and discover.  SG-U certainly has this potential; especially now, in the dawn of the Space Age.  Will be awaiting the swift return of its new episodes to my computer screen...
B002ZG999U|1.0|I got this movie through Netflix, thinking it was just going to be some good, mindless violence.  It was mindless alright, but not in the way that I was expecting!  The action scenes were silly; it was terribly written (very choppy) and did not draw me in at all.
0739350323|5.0|This accidental find is a fun, 'clean' fantasy series that weaves a great story.  I am on The magician now and can hardly wait for the next one.  I listen to the audio version while I commute.  It provides a great escape into a world that may or may not really exist.  Open yourself up and let your imagination run free!!
B004PGO25O|5.0|When I read \\"The War of Art\\" i felt like it was written specifically for me. I feel the same way about \\"Do The Work\\". I found this book to be inspiring and highly motivational, but not in the vague, \\"I should do something\\" sense. This book is specifically inspiring. One can't help but read this book and think of that \\"one thing\\" we all want to do, be, create. That \\"one thing\\" comes to mind and then Mr. Pressfield convinces us to get.to.work!<br />Great book! The time commitment to read it is short, but the impact can be tremendous!<br /><br />JG
1416955070|5.0|This was my first YA book in a long, long time, and I must say I've been left wondering why I hadn't re-visited the genre in so long. The writing is crisp, the voice is strong, and I adore the characters! One of my favourite bits of the book, apart from the awesome plot and action-packed chapters, was the natural, witty dialogue. Oh, and the plot twists, which though not entirely unpredictable, were all well-planted! Without spoiling the book, all I can say is that I look forward to reading books 2 and 3, and wonder if Hodge will return, and if so, if he'll return 'changed'. ;)     Oh, and I absolutely ADORE the shiny book cover!
0439023521|1.0|The first couple of chapters you get the idea that the people in the capital (capitalists) are rich off of the backs of the workers in the districts. I feel it is very Anti-capitalist and manipulates the minds of the young adults who read it. It is gruesome, portrays Future America ( after the sea rises from climate change) as a dog eat dog society out for excess and willing to get it at the cost of human life. You can tell she develops the spirit of rebellion in the heart of Katniss, against those in the Capital. This may not have been the writers intention, but I fully believe it was, and it is time these people are called out on what they are filling the heads of young people with, let's just call it what it is, shall we? An anti-capitalist propaganda machine. If I could have given it a half a star I would have, the writer deserves only that much..... For effort at least. The idea is genius though, charge young adults to manipulate their minds... I hope any parents that read this review at least think twice about letting their child be exposed to this kind of manipulation. I am glad I read it before letting my child. We will not purchase anymore of this authors books. Kinda feel   Iike I have been violated for having purchased this one, total crap.
B004X8W468|5.0|I love this book! I would read it again for sure! Writing=very good use of second person. sometimes confusing but always interesting. Plot= Not too scary but not at all little kid-ish. A little gross at one part but its not that bad. Ending= Weird but kind of cool.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|When I first go it, I was like this is it?  Once I put it up, it looks amazing.  Really classy.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|What never ceases to amaze me is the lot of boneheads who think old school SW fans want inferior quality.  No, you dopes.  No.  All the 1 star reviews are from people who want the highest possible quality of the original content.  Content!  That's the complaint!  Clean the films up, make the sound better, but don't change the story.  Geez, it's tough to make some folks understand something so simple.  George understands it, believe me.  He's just got too much pride to admit his alterations detracted from the magic of the original movies, so you can't have those except in bad form.  But George is no dummy when it comes to money.  Would you leave millions of dollars on the table when it's right there for the taking?  All he's got to do is give the fans who built his franchise what they want.  Then he'll be a big hero.  The fans will sing his praises and he'll make tons of money.  The whole thing will be put to rest.  It's a win/win.
0553582038|2.0|I was looking forward to Feast of Crows, believing I'd find out what happened to the remaining Stark family members and further enjoy the development of their characters.  With every chapter and point of view from yet another little known character, I found myself saying - out loud - \\"focus George,  focus.\\"   He never did.  I truly hope the next book returns to the story as laid out in the first couple of books and these loose fluttering extraneous characters either fly off in the wind or somehow come together in some meaningful, believable way.  I would hate to have the Stark and the direwolves' story line left unanswered at the end of five books.
0307120007|2.0|At 7 months old my child would have this book in pieces. I bought it (in the box) and when I took it out and discovered how flimsy it was I immediately knew I made a bad purchase. I decided to try anyway. Nope not gonna happen.  Maybe she is too young still although she is into peekaboo, turning pages, feeling textures etc. I hope that she will still be into these things by the time she has a more delicate (relatively) touch.
B003XX2PPO|5.0|DOESN'T DISAPPOINT !!!!!!!!!  STICKS WITH WHAT WORKS. GREAT STYLE AND TONE WITH A LITTLE MODERN TOUCH PLUS PLAYS A LITTLE WITH VOCALS.  VERY NICE.

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|I bought this movie because my Hubby kept telling me he wanted to see it.  It wasn't exactly the movie I expected, but it was still good.  Just don't know that it is a movie I would have had to BUY--more like a rental movie, oh well...

B00005B36H|5.0|Probably the best album I have heard from Tool. most of my  favorites are on this one. and yet It's almost like I was hearing all of the material for the first time. Love it
1416955070|5.0|I've heard a lot of different opinions on this series. I'll admit, the first time I picked this book up months and months ago, I just wasn't really interested in reading anything paranormal. I thought the writing was great, but it didn't really grab me. Here lately I've been reading of this genre. So I picked the book back up and started all over again. And I'm thankful that I did because I devoured it.<br /><br />There are werewolves, warlocks, vampires, faeries, demons, and most importantly there are Shadowhunters. More importantly than that, there is a hot one named Jace. I'm sure most of you that have read this book and enjoyed it are probably swooning just by his name. (I know I still am!)<br /><br />The characters in this story are great. There are so many of them whether they are main or minor ones, but they all work smoothly together. Sure Clary is a little reckless with decisions, but I really liked her. I felt as if I were right there along the way finding out this whole world with her. (Personally, I would have have ran the away way with my arms stretched out in the air in a mad scream if this was my life.) Luckily Clary does have her best friend Simon (who is quirky and hilarious) when she's prepared to do whatever it takes to save her mother. I loved how these two completely different sets of \\"people\\" and their worlds clashed together. The book is constantly moving in plot and dialogue. I personally loved the tiffs between Simon and Jace. And Isabelle and Alec's disapproval of mundanes.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare has a wonderful imagination and has opened up a whole new world within this series. It doesn't matter what age you are. If you enjoy paranormal genre that has a great plot line, secrets, and excellent twists - you will want to pick this book up ASAP!
B00000099Y|5.0|Exactly what i expected and more. I have always loved this band and finally having the whole cd makes me so happy. undertow is next on my list.
1416972242|5.0|You know when you get into a series and you have to think if the next one will even meet the expectations? That's something you won't have to worry about with this one. City of Ashes completely delivers! There is so much going on in this series, all the twists and turns, I stayed up almost all night to finish it. I think my love for this series is not only the incredible writing, but the fact that it's written in third person as well. It's awesome to be able to see other characters and get a better feel for them this way instead of only seeing them through one person's eyes.<br /><br />All the main characters are still great. You have to admire the humor in this story. I do believe Simon is hands down the number one best friend any girl could have in their lives. The guy deserves a freakin' medal. While some characters made me want to shake them due to their actions and reactions on things (i.e. Clary and Jace). It also made me think of them as more normal because of it too. I wasn't for sure how to take their relationship either. (I kept referring it to a Flowers in the Attic type deal.) But after I put down the book, I realized how much I love the forbidden relationship. Valentine is also one of the best villains too.<br /><br />Basically this series is just WOW! The plot line is wonderful with the mix of some many other things. I love how mythology and some parts of Christianity have been spread throughout it. If you haven't picked up City of Ashes yet then I am ordering you to RUN to the nearest bookstore and grab yourself a copy!

1416972250|5.0|While I easily breezed through the first two books in the series, this one took me a bit to read. Not because it wasn't good. I just didn't want it to end, and someone was also taunting me with a death toll. (Which I will not do to you - I have my co-workers to be evil towards now.)<br /><br />When getting attached to characters and a series, it's hard to see it go. I was so scared that I might not like it. This is the end, and some endings in other series have made me want to throw the book across the room. City of glass was excellent though. The characters and their relationships grew and grew and I was so pleased to see where most of them ended up. Everything came together in the end, but not in a neatly tied ribbon way. I was very happy because of that. It made it seem more realistic.<br /><br />There are tons of things I would love to spill out here, but like always, I'd give too much away. Basically the Mortal Instruments series is hands down full of awesomeness. Cassandra Clare's has a wonderful, wild, and unique imagination. I'm still blown away by how she describes things and all the details that were put into this book. It really makes the world of Shadowhunters come to life.
142338928X|3.0|I listened to the audio version of this book instead of reading it.  I know that the audio format can dull the experience for some people, but it can also enhance it for others.  Whether this had anything to do with my somewhat mixed experience with this book, I'm not sure.    The negatives:   There are two majors problems with this book for me.  The first is that it is incredibly long and there are simply not enough juicy tidbidts to make me want to listen to it day after day.  The first 3/4 of the book seemed to lack any discernable plot, yet the final 1/4 developed a plot that finally made the book fun and interesting to listen to.    The second problem is something that you'll probably read about in other negative reviews (and maybe some positive ones too): The main character is incredibly arrogant and self-assured.  This may not seem like a big deal, but consider that this story is told from a first-person perspective and (in this format) you can hear the arrogance in the narrator's voice.  Still, some of you may not see this as an issue.  If that's the case, try to imagine listening to the most egotistic, unlikeable person you know for hour after hour.  It gets old fast.    The positives:  Overall, the larger story is very interesting when you get past the frustrating day-to-day ordeals that the main character experiences.  The world created by Rothfuss seems real and believable, as do most of the characters.  The narration is amazing with many different voices seamlessly exchanging dialog throughout the stories.      Conclusion:  In retrospect, I would have chosen another book to read.  There are simply too many page turners out there for me to spend so much time on a book with so little pay-off.  However, I decided to try the second book after hearing from others that it was better than the first.  I'm now half-way through it.  Although it shares many of its themes with the first book, it does seem to be better written, with more interesting material.  I'm still not getting enough of the overarching plot to satisfy me, but it is a step in the right direction.  Hopefully the series continues in that direction.  Rothfuss definitely has the necessary writing ability, but either the books need to be shorter, or they need more substance.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  The length for this type of game is perfect.  None of the puzzles are really frustrating but they are still challenging.  Worth the price.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This  is not your typical Civil War story.  It illustrates what life was like for the ones left behind.  It gives the viewer a glimpse of what all families must endure through the struggles of war.  Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellweger play their parts perfectly.

0307454541|3.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, the most original thing of note in this book is the girl with the dragon tattoo herself, the punk savant protagonist Lisbeth Salander.  Unfortunately, she's really the secondary character here, and hardly gets any play at all during the first third of the book.  The plot itself is fairly pedestrian and the writing is very \\"populist\\" is its style - nothing too challenging for the reader, though I will say that likely is the translator's doing - I'll give Larsson the benefit of the doubt in his original work.  Regardless, the book chugs along at a decent pace and though the end starts to veer into the torture-porn area made popular with the \\"Hostel\\" subgenre of horror films in recent years, it quickly steers back into standard thriller mode to close things out.  Worth a read if you're interested in a pop culture phenomenon, to be sure, though by no stretch of the imagination is this grand fiction.<br /><br />Bonus points for you if you're able to keep track of how many references there are to a character making/drinking/cleaning up after coffee - I daresay it gets borderline ridiculous.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I don't use the cloud or media player, simply because they're terrible. Amazon mp3 has made me start buying music again, which in itself is a great feat. Buying is simple, which makes compulsive purchases almost too easy. I often find myself thinking &quot;It's only $5. I won't miss it.&quot;

0670022411|5.0|Now, I've read some of the one star ratings.  I disagree with them (I didn't read them all) completely.  I found it (the novel, not the criticisms) to be engrossing, enthralling, and in essence, eminent readable.  Those that say that there are \\"boring\\" parts just don't recognize that they are part of the plot development (IMHO).  Those that find it boring just want action, without the color that makes a good novel.  Sometimes I do encounter novels that do make too much of this to fill up the pages  (I'm currently in the middle of such a book), so I'm not unfamiliar  with such a difference.<br /><br />Anyway, I found the novel to be well written and I wished it would go on much longer (I can envision a more satisfactory conclusion).  Succinctly, I recommend it highly.  Others have described it better than I can; I just liked it a lot (especially for a first novel).
0736092269|5.0|Hands down one of the best tools to keep in your bodybuilding collection to get back to anytime you're wondering about a move or a particular muscle group. This group beautifully presents some of the most important bodybuilding moves and shows the primary muscles worked as well as secondary muscles. The artwork is flawless and the book looks just elegant to have. I even go back to this book anytime I am changing my workouts so I can see pick exercises for the muscle groups that are slacking behind... It also has some information about stretching and body injuries but not a whole lot. However it is enough for the beginner-intermediate bodybuilder to know about.<br />Buy this book, put it in your gym bag and keep it there... You will need it I assure you. It is a great help tool.
1608191664|4.0|Ha-Joon chang's style in \\"23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism\\" is to make his \\"things\\" simple, almost fun efforts to stretch the mind.  But what is important is not the exact \\"things\\" that Chang challenges about free-market capitalism, but rather that we are \\"allowed\\" to even challenge free market extremism at all. All of us need to have the courage to think outside the box.<br /><br />All of us need to challenge our own \\"things\\" that we hear or behavior we see -- automatic mindlessness destined to get us in more trouble yet.<br /><br />I enjoyed Ha-Joon Chang's style but nevertheless found myself wanting a more Socratic style - tougher with direct questions that corner the extremists who have held us hostage - an approach that would nail those who hide behind false ways of thinking in the face of obvious facts and logical truths that have with the financial crisis been portrayed so publically on the world stage.<br /><br />It is clear that what the dominant American capitalism has evolved into is on automatic pilot.  Yet this is exactly what the free-marketeers glory in most:  no one is responsible; the mysterious \\"market\\" decides everything and is ever treated with utmost respect and worship.<br /><br />Many of those who have benefited most from its evolution are afraid to even think about changing the dominant extremist way of thinking about capitalism.<br /><br />And so they attack all such fairly timid approaches to their myths, such as this book, and try to make us believe the whole system of capitalism will come crashing down if they give an inch.  This irritates me because then the topic under discussion becomes distorted into socialism against capitalism.  Their defensive avoidance and mindless absolutism goes on and on.<br /><br />It is as if a room full of people were wanting to carry on a serious discussion about what concerns us all deeply and instead the speaker who is supposed to take the other side against Chang has suddenly become violently angry and psychotic.  We are forced to put all our energy into dealing with his brain, his belief systems, and his distortions.  So we don't get to hear a rebuttal at all.  We want to hear some real efforts to address Chang's points but instead we get a terrorist who demands his way or the highway to some socialist hell.<br /><br />These extreme marketeers turn capitalism into absolutistic ideology that belongs only to them, rather than a practical reality that concerns us all. Extremism is not capitalism at all because it refuses to be honest, reasonable, or logical. It is actually a distortion of the belief system they claim to hold,  refusing to acknowledge capitalism's reality around the world and through history -- as Chang does with such facility -- determined to remain dangerously out of control.<br /><br />In the face of our present extreme ideological high-jacking, \\"21 Things\\" for all its light-hearted approach--sugar to make the medicine go down--nevertheless is full of powerful points that need to be addressed directly by the free-marketeers point-by-point in great detail, not with broad white-washing ideological strokes.to put all our energy into dealing with his brain, his belief systems, and his distortions.

0307463745|5.0|Well, I'm taking this in small snippets, the way its is meant to be read I am sure. You know all of that common sense so often left out of the workplace - well, its all documented here. Excellent, if brief read.  Useful for looking up things that make you wonder if its you that got out of bed and stepped in the dog's dinner - you'll be pleasantly surprised, its everyone else.
B001OBT3FC|1.0|Talk about an insult. Ozawa was ok with Boston but to have him attemting to conduct a memorial concert for one of tghe greatest conductors of the 2oth century!!?? What idiot conceived this? Give it an honourable burial. But don't bother listening. It's horrible start to finish.

B004BBDHEK|3.0|Although he has ventured into new paths of musical style, his latest release is good but not great.  He seems to have lost his touch, with melody, story telling and possibly his soul.   Bring back the sounds of Swept Away, Almost a Whisper and Reflections of Passion.  Touch your heart and allow it to bring notes to the paper.  Give us what you shared from the first concerts in the 90's, passion, drive, energy.      Michaels  Music Beyond Words
B0039TD7PY|2.0|I love James and Carole, but I was very disappointed that this recording soundsso much like an amateur job.  Over-compressed and over-limited, the dynamics are squashed.  Why would they do that with such delicate music???!!  A travesty, at least to me. I had expected the same quality as James' wonderful live set (itunes.apple.com/us/album/james-taylor-live/id169629332).
0064440346|2.0|At this point I have read every Frog and Toad book so often, I know most of them by heart and my daughter can practically recite them (which is adorable, but also a bit tedious). So I took a look through the rest of the Lobel oevre, and found the excellent Mouse Tails ... and this. I don't know what is so offputting about this book -- maybe that the owl lives alone? He comes off like an agoraphobic shut-in with some kind of learning disorder, and the whole book feels claustrophobic and weird. I swear, I read this once and stuck it in the back of the bookshelf. Hey, they can't all be home runs.
B003QSHIPS|4.0|NoIt's a great album and the LP plays with no issues. Just saying since I've had a number of LPs lately that have defect that seem to be tied to the whole production. See my Radiohead Kid A LP review.
B002JH3TW8|4.0|Having just acquired a new iMac last fall, and having an older firewire hard drive, I needed an 800 to 400 firewire adapter. But I was dubious of the solid adapters; with the weight of the cable run on them, would they stay connected. The Moshi adapter comes with a short run of cable which flexes and provides strain relief. Also, cheaper than any adapter in the computer store. Recommended.
B0002BO05S|1.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I really like Max von Sydow as Jesus.  He is very believable and he is a great actor (Jose Ferrer and Charlton Heston too).    Unfortunatley, that is the only positive comment that I have to make.  The direction and screenplay are terrible.  What is so hard about consulting and following the story that the Word of God has to say?  The true message is not told.  Why not?    I have not seen every Jesus movie, but I have seen quite a few.  I highly recommend the \\"Gospel of John\\".  I have watched it twice recently(the 3-hour version) and it is awesome.  It was made in the same year(2004) as Mel Gibson's \\"Passion\\".  If you are looking for a film that is true to scripture, watch \\"The Gospel of John\\".
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I just finished watching this DVD set with Joe Bonamassa and Eric Clapton... that one piece of video alone.. of Joe and Eric playing together... is well worth seeing! The skill, the joy of both men playing the Blues as they love doing.. the fantastic guitar skills.<br /><br />Eric Clapton was the original inspiration that got Joe to start playing the guitar... so it was a meeting of two of the greatest guitar players alive. The older and the younger.<br /><br />Paul Jones was presented at the concert. :)<br /><br />The set is well put together... the performance is excellent. If you like to watch performances... and love blues and guitar music... you won't want to miss this DVD set! Kick up the settings for bass and vocal if you're sliding the DVD into your laptop... there are many great songs and much good music to enjoy. The backup musicians are superb!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B004GHNHVW|1.0|Not much more to say. I am a Paul Simon fan, saw that the new album was released, which had good reviews on Amazon. Bought it, but I cannot fathom why it had good reviews? It is very boring, and a waste of my money. I gave it a chance but will probably never play it again.
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|Love this game.  The physics are great,  the graphics really nice.   The AI player is so so, even at best setting.   Luckily the online games are so much fun,  and you can usually find a good challenge.
0738711500|5.0|I purchased this set a few months ago and am very happy with my choice. I am just starting to learn tarot and am glad I chose this deck to learn from. The book is clear and concise with helpful exercises to enrich one's learning and the artwork on the cards is simply beautiful. The designs on the cards also help in revealing their meanings. I honestly don't see myself deviating from this deck any time soon! Please note that this IS A SET, comprising both the paperback book AND the deck. I don't think Amazon is quite clear on that in the details.
0061914177|5.0|Wow!  One word sums it up!  Wow!  What a great book.  I listened to the audio version yesterday and I am now filled with so many good ideas.  My passion is there and this book gives me a road map to follow.  Thanks Gary!  You did a fantastic job on the recording.
0525951652|5.0|I loved Ken Follett's historical novel of World War I.  Despite my hesitancy due to its length and being history relived, I was immediately engaged in its early 20th century world.      The people who inhabit Britain, Russia, France, Germany, and the US, are alive with love, fear, and eventually, hope.  They cross all socio-econimic lines and envelope personalities and character from meek and wise to arrogant and ignorant.  We know these people and crave their just desserts.  The lovers, Maude and Walter, are pitiable yet strong and the social activists, Gregory and Billy, resilient and determined. The reader does not want to lose them as friends as the book draws to its predetermined end.  Engaged in two wars, as we currently are, we can and do empathize with the governments and officers sending boys off to war and the soldiers fighting and dying for the freedom they value.    This reader anxiously awaits the second book of the trilogy.
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|very very fun game... just needs more processor speed than the moto droid 1 has. it has too many fish for my phone to process, and reboots phone, so i lose my save spot.
0061990477|5.0|No book can really compare with The Thorn Birds! It is a novel that is poignant as well as rich with  awe-inspiring detail. It is also the saga of the Cleary family, who goes from rags to riches but still endures  the heartache of death, love and loss in the heat of the Austrailian outback.    McCoulough has spun a novel so grand, few can match her wit and her deep description of character. Through by her protagonist Maggie Cleary, the reader witnesses a young girl mature into a woman, lacking the care/nurturing of her mother, Maggie becomes fascinated by Ralph Debricasart( a priest) visiting the Drogheda estate of her parents.  At first he pities this beautiful young child, since she is the only girl in a family of boys, but his emotions bloom into love as the years peel away- a forbidden love. Although he painstakingly puts up a good fight to never fall in love with Maggie, he is soon called to confront years of built-up lust and adoration,the feelings that Maggie has openly showed him early on during her youth, but was never requited.    Besides all the toil that is burned into the readers mind, from the constant work on this vast farm, this novel delivers a powerful twist of events, but nothing surfaces to the top of this incessant tide of drama more than the hate,the resentment,and the love bore between Maggie and Ralph.~Author of Karma Sings the Married Man's Blues~THB
193413712X|5.0|Tinkers is a really well written book. The characters are are well developed and the story development is interesting. But the whole novel is overcome with a deep sadness. Why does reading a great book have to feel like you've just carried around a ponderous weight? Tinkers is a good read, but if you are feeling a little middle aged you may want to try something a little more upbeat.
B004RLEBTY|5.0|Red Fang knows how to do it and they do it as they please.  This album heavy stuff and must be listened to LOUD!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Not sure what I can add to the already numerous reviews that have pretty much said everything but I feel compelled to add to the other 5 star reviews. Superb in every way: acting, directing, production. A moving and motivating film. If you haven't seen it - see it now. If you are at all skeptical rent it first but you will probably end up buying it after viewing the rental.
B001TKMAGW|5.0|The cover to this album says it all. It is gothic and eerie. It conjures darkness, magic, the occult, evil and cynicism in grand fashion. It is Sabbath's second best album only to PARANOID. From the tolling bell at the beginning of the album, (which has been many times imitated since) to the last notes of The Warning, this album creates a dark mood with creepy, \\"I sold my soul to the devil\\" hard blues-based rock. There is a healthy dose of jazz that infuses the record with some sophistication that keeps it from being a total headbanger cliche. The lyrics are well written with NIB being my favorite. It is about Lucifer falling in love with a mortal woman, but it could be interpreted as Lucifer's temptation of all mortals. It used to send a shiver up my spine when I was young. (There has always been much contention on the meaning of the song, but bassist Geezer Butler himself revealed this to be the theme) The remastering job on the deluxe Sabbath cds is also excellent and separates the instruments more than the original recording did. This deluxe version also includes Evil Woman, the first single ever released by the band and which wasn't part of the original album. This is a classic and has influenced rock and heavy metal until this day.<br /><br />My favorite Sabbath albums in order from best to worst are:<br /><br />PARANOID<br />BLACK SABBATH<br />MASTER OF REALITY<br />SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH<br />Vol.4<br />HEAVEN AND HELL<br />THE MOB RULES
B004INNRFK|5.0|Enjoyed this DVD very much.  Not quite as good as the first Hit Man DVD, but still amazing that David Foster can get all of the performers in Las Vegas at the same time. Says alot re how they feel about the man.  Well worth the time and $$  to watch!
B0023P1D8S|5.0|This is probably Sabbath's most cohesive album. It flows very well from start to finish. All the songs are good and several are classics. The biggest complaint is that the album is too short. There are only 6 proper songs and two instrumental guitar pieces. The songs are high quality and I would call all of them highlights. \\"Would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope?\\" has to be one of the all time great lyrics in rock. It always brings a smile to my face. The mellow track, Solitude, has always been a bone of contention amongst fans. I love it. This is a classic heavy metal/hard rock album and is highly recommended to fans of that music.    My favorite Sabbath albums in order from best to worst are:    PARANOID  BLACK SABBATH  MASTER OF REALITY  SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH  Vol.4  HEAVEN AND HELL  THE MOB RULES
B003NX76BM|5.0|I had two people tell me I HAD to read this book and boy oh boy am I glad I did! This was the perfect mixture of mystery, love and laughter.. Another Nora Roberts hit! Too bad this wasn't part one of a trilogy! I just fell in love with the characters! ALL of them!! The dogs were amazing to read about. I felt like I was there, watching them. Just wonderful! =) I loved it so much I let everyone on Facebook know how great it is. A must read!! Keep em coming Nora!!
1594744769|3.0|This story as a whole was not to my tastes. HOWEVER - I couldn't help but be impressed by the author's imagination and by the way he took an assortment of actual (and very bizarre) photographs and was able to link them together to form his plot line. As other reviewers have pointed out it does not always flow and there are sections that seem a bit forced. In other areas the story could really use a bit of polish, but over all I found it to be rather inventive and even if the story was not to my tastes, I had to appreciate that it was new and really unlike anything I have read before.
B003UESJ9M|4.0|Watched this without great expectations as the 'country singer redemption' story has been done plenty of times.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised with how fresh a basically old story was made to look and sound.  Given the quality of the music I'd have liked a lot more of it and the film is probably 15 minutes too long for the storyline.    Gwyneth Paltrow is a excellent singer - she could easily have a second career as a country singer (probably not a megastar though!).
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I can see that this will be a popular and well regarded film, and I thought it was pretty well acted except when, on occasion, it descended into caricature posing.  Nevertheless, it just isn't for me and I think my reasons are mainly:    - I don't like films where all the characters are unsympathetic.  - I don't like films which are set in circumstances (in this case the world of ballet) for which I have no empathy, nor interest.    This clearly means that the film isn't at fault, necessarily, so much as me for watching it when I should have guessed I wouldn't like it.    My main reason, therefore, for writing this review is to warn potential buyers to make sure it's something they are going to want as there will, I suspect, be few watchers who don't take extreme positions on its quality.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Nikon quietly replaced the LF-1 with this cap, the LF-4.  Nothing Earth shattering, but the new cap is easier to grip and has a larger flange to press against the lens' mount as well as any weather sealing.  Both are nice improvements, and like the LF-1 (and unlike many knock-offs), this cap easily and securely mounts no matter how rotated.  So cheaper, better (just barely), and likely soon all that will be, that's what you get.  Perhaps the lower cost is due to the LF-1 being made in Japan while this is made in Thailand, but since Nikon sees fit to make millions of DSLRs and lenses in Thailand (not to mention that Japan has lots of other stuff to worry about), that's not so much as issue as an observation.
B0000640VO|5.0|this is a great movie. a little fantasy-esque life of Paris and the music is fantastic- composed by Yann Tiersen and makes you feel Amelie's strife in her life. some of the details aren't accurate (like how a server lives in a nice apartment in Paris) but aside from details like these the film is super cute and the ending is lovely.  :]
B004LL1HM4|2.0|Nasally whining over meandering instrumentation that leads to nowhere.  \\"Pointlessness Blues\\" is probably a more apt title.  Comparisons to CSNY are off target...maybe Graham Nash with a bad head cold.  All in all, just not that good. Sophomore slump, indeed. Buy the first one and hope the third one turns out to be as good.
B00278U1WA|5.0|This album falls in line with Regina's discography.  A little different than the last, but ALWAYS FANTASTIC.    I would say the biggest differences on this CD is that leans a little more to the POP side.  And there was a lot more time put in to mixing... a cleaner sound I guess is what I am trying to say.    But everything else is pure Regina.  If you are a fan you will love it.  If you are not, shame on you.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Another great Harry Potter move.  I can't wait for part 2.  Great packaging with DVD, Blu-Ray, and instructions to download a digital copy of PC or iPad.

B004VN5MNC|5.0|Some bands will get better at their craft, and some bands stay in the game WAY too long. The Foo Fighters never dissapoint. You know you can count on them to stay true to themselves, and their fans, and put out an awesome, honest effort. Grohl and the gang are at the top of their game. They don't hold back on anything. One song can be a pop ditty and the next song is a face shredder! Because of their honesty and loyalty to their fans, they can play whatever they want and their fans love them in return.

1595826971|5.0|This is a gorgeous book from cover to cover!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is in love with any part of American McGee's world.  This book is full of concept art that was done throughout the process of creating the game, including a lot of the final art that made it into the game (along with a LOT that didn't).  There is an introduction written by McGee himself.  Then, the book is basically the story of how the game was created.  The different domains that the game covers are talked about in great detail, and did I mention the artwork is gorgeous?!?!?!  A must have for anyone who appreciates the world of Alice!

B004SBX112|5.0|angry birds seasons is an awesome game, bringing more levels to the already plenty enough of levels game. i got the ad free version when it was free on the amazon market, i havent tried this game on my tablet yet but it works perfect on my t-mobile g2 and nexus one.
B0049JPU8A|4.0|These guys are great. I really enjoyed their first album, and this one is no different. I will be able keep my typically long winded review structure in check with this one.     Each song really does stand out on this album in its own way. They're well crafted songs and the album structure works well. Thematically, I dug this album all around. Love, loss, economy, hard times, etc...these guys are great at finding topics to sing about. Is it a little generic when compared to other stuff out there? Sure. But they sing and play with conviction so it doesn't sound repetitive or like they're one trick ponies.    Okay, *deep breath* I have one complaint about this album I need to get out. These guys have great songwriting chops. I won't deny that. The one thing that, for me, keeps this from being a five star album is the production. Nearly every time these guys reach a chorus or something it EXPLODES with noise that is not necessary.     Some of these songs don't need such lavish polishing. It's like the producer was in the studio just yelling \\"WE NEED MORE LAYERS OF NOISE! IT'S NEVER ENOUGH!\\" I want to hear some more stripped down arrangements here. These guys seem like they can play, and their songs have some genuine emotion to them, but I feel it gets lost in the \\"mass of noise.\\"     For example- the chorus on \\"For the First Time\\" is RIDICULOUSLY overdone with extra layers. Honestly, when I hear the song and look at the lyrics- I'm thinking \\"hard times, young love, they don't have much...that should be a song with less in terms of polish and extras. The song can reflect the theme!\\" I ain't sayin' we need to go as far Rick Rubin did with Johnny Cash or anything, but c'mon- let me HEAR THE BAND!     Anyways, I didn't mean to go on a tangent there- it just sorta happened. Overall, my point is this- should you get this cd? Sure, or at least the mp3's! For those of you digging the songs you hear on the radio from these guys- you won't be disappointed.
B004FPZ2KY|4.0|If I were reviewing Pride and Prejudice alone, I would give this novel six stars. It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.<br /><br />My complaint is that the Kindle version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Kindle). This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Gutenberg Project, and used to be free on Kindle. I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn't worth it. Seriously.

0061537969|4.0|Our book club uniformly rated this book 4 stars. Only one of 20 of us voted thumbs down even though he is a mushy dog lover, must have had a bad day. Readers should know that this is not a book about dogs or even by a dog. One quickly forgets or overlooks that a dog is the narrator. The book is very well written except for some preachiness in a couple of places. There are several sentences the quality of which are rarely found. It is a fast read but the emotions and energy of the tale(s) linger long after the final page is turned. I recommend this as a pleasant and  enlightening read of perseverance and personal evolution.

The confluence of all areas makes this a movie that I return to watch time and again.  A real experience of historical people.
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey manages to convey her humor very clearly into print as easy as she does on camera. She takes us through her childhood up through SNL, impersonating Sara Palin, and running the show on 30 Rock. As a fellow female nerd I found pieces of my life were pretty similar to Tina's. What I enjoyed the most about this book was her commentary about a women comedians and how difficult is has been for them. There is a lot of sexism in Hollywood and Ms. Fey points out a lot of is. She also talks a lot about being a working woman in general.  What I did not like was that she believes being a size 12 made her fat......
0670022411|5.0|Alot of people think that the paranormal/urban fantasy/vampire genre is getting old, or has been over done. I have to agree that I have become very picky about the books that I read in these genres at this point. There are several series that I continue to read and enjoy, but as for new material, it is getting more difficult to find something fresh and different. This book, however, had everything that I love, history, magic, paranormal characters, a little romance.....The author gave us a wonderful story and great characters that really stood out. As I read it, I found myself feeling that it was a cross between several other books that I have read in this genre. I can't help feeling, though, that by combining all the elements of the other books, Deborah Harkness really got it right. While Matthew Clairmont is a vampire in love with a \\"warm blood\\", he has none of the more annoying characteristics that Edward exhibits in Twilight (which, by the way, I loved, but this book is definitely less fairy tale and more adult). Diana Bishop is a witch with a famous lineage, but she is not quite like any witch I have read about in other stories. There is a secret manuscript and a mystery, but the story surrounding them in complex and complicated, too different things. And there will be time travel, but approached in a new and different way.     As for the author, Ms. Harkness is a history professor at a major university, and a lover of science. Both of these loves come across in this book. Her historical references are spot on and show her extensive understanding of history. In addition, Edward Clairmont is a geneticist, and with such a character, she is able to show her love of science., but without being so detailed as to lose the reader. In fact, both science and magic blend well in this book.     I also loved where it ended. For the first book of a trilogy, it did not tie up all the loose ends, but it did not leave you hanging at an inappropriate place either.     To sum itup, at 700 pages, this book was a real page turner, and read fairly quickly. I am really looking forward to the next book, but I hear it is a long way away :(
B000E41MS6|5.0|I absolutely love this show! This first season reboots the long running British Scifi show. The Doctor in this season is played by the awesome Christopher Eccleston and I consider him to be \\"my\\" Doctor. Anyone a fan of Scifi, British TV, Chris Eccleston, Billie Piper, time travel, or just the adventurous should check out this show. It has it's moments where it gets a little cheesy but that's all part of the charm. This show is great for kids as well. In fact it's made with children in mind.

0545123275|5.0|I wasn't sure I would care for reading another plot about werewolf's but after reading the inside jacket at the book store, it sounded like it would be romantic with some mystery mixed in.  I was intrigued and once I started reading, I was pulled into the story instantly.<br /><br />Grace loves the wolf's that roam beyond the woods behind her house. She grew up watching them from her window and back yard during the winter seasons. Out of all the wolves in the entire pack, one is her favorite. He's different, with striking yellow eyes. Even though he's just a wolf, she feels like there is an unspoken connection between them. Sometimes he will lay at the edge of the woods behind her house and watch her for hours. She wishes sometimes she could be a wolf too, just to be with the yellow eyed one.<br /><br />Sam loves the wolves too but that's because he kind of has to...they are his family. He shares his winters with them, roaming the woods with his pack, as a fellow member of the pack. Then the summer heats up and it brings him back to his human form. Summer is the only time he gets to live his life as \\"normal.\\" Until winter sets in and transforms him back into a wolf.<br /><br />This summer is going to be different. While Grace is shopping in a local bookstore, she meets the store clerk. His yellow eyes are familiar and she knows she knows him from somewhere, but where? It's not long before Sam's secret is revealed to Grace. Their love blooms and Grace knows that she has to find a way to keep Sam from changing into a wolf before winter approaches. She is determined to stay with Sam no matter the risks!<br /><br />I found Grace to be strong and the way she loves Sam is so natural. I loved her determination to do whatever it took to keep Sam with her. I fell in love with Sam from the start. He is sensitive, romantic and amazingly poetic as he creates beautiful lyrics.<br /><br />This book had me up late and spending every free moment trying to fit one more page in. I was on the edge of my seat, living every moment with Sam and Grace.  I felt like I was right there with Sam in the candy store, I could smell it in my mind so clear. I was with Grace when she touched the wolves, I could feel the fur on my hand and smell wolf sent in the air.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater did a fantastic job on this book. I was hooked from the moment I opened the book. I love how the point of view changed between Sam and Grace. It fit perfectly and allowed the reader to see and feel a situation from both points of view. The plot was amazing and the writing flowed effortlessly.<br /><br />I highly recommend you read Shiver if you haven't already done so. Also, if you've already read Shiver, be sure to pick up the next installment, Linger. It is also amazing and I'll be posting my review on it soon.oment with Sam and Grace.

B004KA9MQO|4.0|OK-I admit i didn't want to enjoy Skinny Jennifer as much as Big Jennifer, and didn't want to buy a CD to hear the same song from the Weight Watcher's commercials, but I love this CD. Jennifer's voice is clear and powerful, unlike any voice of today's music world. Reminds me of Aretha Franklin, the older Whiteny Houston, and Yolanda Adams. There are a few catchy ryhtmic songs, but the ballads are where she shows her strength. She sings like she's been through something, and as we all know, she definitely has.

There are wars going on in all the districts, fighting to keep control away from the capital. Through all of this, Katniss feels as if it's her fought, she's the one who starting the uprising, and she is the one the districts have chosen as \\"The Mockingjay.\\" It is up to her and the rest of the rebels of district 13 to bring down the Capital- President Snow. But she will meet a great deal of resistance. Petta is not the same anymore, not the sweet, loving boy we've come to trust and love. He's angry, hateful, wants revenge, wants Katniss dead, but why? Coin, the leader of district 13 will be the proposed leader over the new district if the Capital falls. Will she lead the way or does she have something else in mind far worse? Will Katniss and Gale be together or will Petta have a change of heart for Katniss? Time will tell, people we love will die, and will the districts survive the wrath of the Capital? Or will the rebels win their fight?<br /><br />Oh my goodness!  What a fantastic way to end The Hunger Games trilogy. I loved every minute of this book. There were no slow moments and the action had me flipping pages fast as I could read them. At one point, I was like....\\"Come Katniss...Shape up! Stop feeling sorry for your self! Stop blaming yourself! Move on and get out there and kick some butt!\\"<br /><br />Oh and then there's Petta. He just broke my heart! This book was such a change of character for him. From the first book, The Hunger Games, I was \\"Team Petta.\\" I'd have to say that in Mockingjay, his attitude was getting the better of me!  Gale played a much bigger role this time. He is a great fighter and you get to see how deep down he truly hates the capital. Katniss seemed to have a hard time figuring out who her heart wanted her to be with, Gale or Petta. I found myself wondering the same thing. Gale is such a likeable guy and the whole time I was reading, I was praying Petta would have a change of heart towards Katniss.<br /><br />The ending was perfect and there are twist that you dont see coming. No only wish was that there would have been an update in the epilogue on some of the other characters to know how their lives ended up.<br /><br />I thought this was a fan-tas-tic read and absolutely recommend you read Mockingjay or the Hunger Games series ASAP!s such a likeable guy and the whole time I was reading, I was praying Petta would have a change of heart towards Katniss.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Just finished this one a couple of days ago and I loved it as much as I loved the first. Honestly one of the best books I have ever read.
B004VD3PE0|5.0|My Thoughts:  So I have heard a lot of talk about this book and how wonderful it was and I decided to buy it after seeing it on sale at my local bookstore. After the first 20 pages tragedy strikes. On a wet and snowy Oregon road, Mia and her family are in a horrible car accident. As Mia watches from the sidelines, she see the accident scene. She see the mangled bodies of her parents, younger brother and of herself. Mia is stuck in-between life and death. It's up to her to decide it she should stay here on Earth as an orphan or move on to be with her parents in death. It's her decision, should she stay or should she go?<br /><br />The accident in itself was horrific, however since I wasn't invested in the characters yet and didn't feel much emotion for them this early in the book I wasn't distraught over it. It's only after you get to know Mia and her family later on in the book when you feel so sad that this has happened to this family.  I loved Mia's family and how real they were. They were young parents who loved music and having fun and were a little on the wild side though they were still good parents. Mia was close to her family and enjoyed spending time with them.<br />I adored Adam, Mia's boyfriend. Forman showed how true and honest their love and relationship was. It was more than a high school romance. They loved each other for what they had in common, music. Adam and his band who played punk rock and Mia who played Cello and love for classical. They loved each other more for their differences which brought them so much closer.<br /><br />The emotions that Mia's family and friends go though surrounding this terrible accident are so gut wrenching. It raw and painful honest. There is a scene or two with Mia's grandparents that brought a few tears to my eyes but the ending of the book had me crying like a baby. It was satisfying and you fully understand why she made the choice she did...<br /><br />I do have to mention that there will be a second book to this story told in Adam's POV which is due out in April 2011 called Where She Went. This book sounds like it's going to be just as fantastic as If I Stay. Also let me point out that after I finished If I Stay, I read the synopsis to Where She Went and proceeded to cry my eyes out even more. This book left me raw with such emotion that I was in tears for about an hour.<br />I would say that if you have not already read If I stay, DO NOT read the synopsis to book #2. It will ruin the ending for you in If I Stay.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. There are no words to describe how heartbreaking and beautiful this story truly is.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Now I'm not one to write a very long review so I'm hoping 5 stars will suffice. But I will say this is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read, I am anticipating book 3.
0802798225|5.0|My Thoughts: Since I started blogging almost a year ago, I've heard about this book. Not once did I hear anything negative about it and I knew that I wanted to read it...eventually. So finally I picked it up.  Now that I've read it, I have to review it and frankly I've been putting off writing the review. Simply because I'm not sure my words can adequately describe how amazing I thought this book was.<br /><br />The plot seemed original and predictable but that in no way affected my feeling towards it. The story felt real and relatable. The character were alive and kept me turning the pages, eager to find out what was going to happen next. Don't be fooled into thinking this story is just another `opposites attract/ from two sides of the tracks' kind of love story. It was so much more than that.  It was about being honest with yourself, trusting in others and not judging on appearance but understanding the person within.<br /><br />The alternating point of view chapters between Brittney and Alex made these two characters come alive. With Brittney you are able see into the rich school girl's lifestyle; see her obsessive mother, never home father, and older sister, watch her struggle and find acceptance. All of these actions make her pages come alive. With Alex you get to see his hard life, his gang life and what he must do to protect his friends and family. You get to see how incredibly smart he is; his struggles to want out of his lifestyle and what he must do to achieve his goals. Then you mix these two characters together and it's a gratifying, sad, sweet story that left me thinking about Alex and Brittney long after I finished turning the pages.<br /><br />I could say more but then it would turn into babble and gushing and more raving about Alex then you probably want to hear, so I'll just say that this is a MUST read story and I can only hope that those who read it, love it as much as I did!
B002GJT4XW|1.0|I love this film, but this review is for this item in particular, which I bought mostly for the digital copy. Much to my dismay, in tiny print on the insert inside, it notes that the code is redeemable for a limited time and expired in December 2010.<br /><br />Suck.
B004TE6F66|5.0|Great expectations come with any sequel book. We expect the next book to be as good or better than the previous. Linger defiantly did not disappoint. Again I was pulled into the story right from the first page.<br /><br />Grace and Same are together now but they will still have to fight to stay together. Sam struggles to deal with his wolf past while Grace has something gnawing inside trying to free itself. He has a feeling what it is but she tries to push through it for Sam... because she can't be without him ever again.<br /><br />Cole, a new wolf, chose the become a wolf. This was the perfect way for him to leave his past behind and lose himself forever. He is dangerously handsome and secretly smart. His brains are the key to discovering more about the wolves.<br /><br />Isabel struggles to deal with the loss of her brother after her and Grace tried to cure him from turning into a wolf. The experiment worked on Sam but had a deadly effect on her brother.<br /><br />Isabel and Cole have a connection in this story. As Isabel says: \\"I had this feeling that he and I, in this moment, were a car crash, and instead of putting on the brakes, I was hitting the accelerator.\\"<br /><br />Just as in Shiver is told in Grace and Sam's point of view, Linger is told in Grace, Sam, Isabel and Cole's point of view. You may think that this could get confusing but you would be wrong. It was clearly written and clear to understand. This allows the reader to see everything from their points of view and I loved it!<br /><br />Linger had me staying up late into the night and sneaking a page here and there wherever I could.  Towards the end I could feel how it was going to end and my heart ached for Sam .<br /><br />I highly recommend you read this book if you haven't already read the first installment, Shiver. It does not disappoint and it will have you desperately wanting to read the last in the trilogy ~ Linger~ which is scheduled to come out in July 2011.<br /><br />Congratulation Maggie for another fantastic novel!!<br /><br />I leave you with one of my favorite quotes from Linger~<br /><br />\\"I won't let this be my good-bye. I've folded one thousand paper crane memories of me and Grace, and I've made my wish. I will find a cure. And then I will find Grace.\\"  ~Sam~favorite quotes from Linger~    \\"I won't let this be my good-bye. I've folded one thousand paper crane memories of me and Grace, and I've made my wish.

B004E0Z4XK|4.0|This is an album I have waited for with eager anticipation ever since I heard it was in the making. One of my favourite producers Danger Mouse collaborating with Italian composer Daniele Luppi on an album of theatrical Spagetti movie soundscapes, and the vocals of Jack White and Norah Jones. How could it possibly fail?<br /><br />Well, it doesn't. The sweeping \\"Theme Of \\"Rome\\"\\" (laced with operatic flourishes and delicately tapped percussion) opens the album, followed by the gently shuffling \\"The Rose With A Broken Neck\\" with White's vocals layered in upper and lower register. White appears again on \\"Two Against One\\" (in a spoken/sung performance), and closing cut \\"The World\\".<br /><br />The pace of the album rarely strays above a midtempo shuffle, and every song is brief. Jones appears on the sultry \\"Season's Trees\\", the dark \\"Black\\" (with cascading guitar sounds and an intro remniscent of The Eagles' \\"Hotel California\\"), and the gently swinging \\"Problem Queen\\".<br /><br />Other standouts are the Bluesy \\"Roman Blue\\", the ghostly \\"The Gambling Priest\\", and the incredibly beautiful \\"Morning Fog\\" (with quivery organ, haunting harmonies and a delightful keyboard solo).<br /><br />It's nothing earth shattering, just deeply affecting and beautiful, and sometimes, that is enough.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Great rock music, with a hint of classic in the underbelly!  It's so much fun to listen so, you can focus on either of the music genres and enjoy it all.  I'd purchase it for gifts for friends who like either the rock side or the classic side and maybe it will teach them something about other types of music!
B004NJW96C|4.0|\\"Destroyed\\" continues along the path taken on Moby's last album \\"Wait For Me\\" but with dark and light hues sharply contrasted this time. It was apparently recorded while Moby was touring and suffering from insomnia at night.<br /><br />Opening is the ambient instrumental \\"The Broken Places\\", and there are many more where that came from; the upbeat \\"Sevastopol\\", the cinematic cathedral \\"Stella Maris\\", and \\"The Violent Bear It\\" (with swirling keys and gentle beats midway that rise to a chiming crescendo).<br /><br />Some songs like \\"Be The One\\" have repetitive lyrics acting as flourishes in the same way as say synths. \\"The Low Hum\\" is an echoey ballad with female vocals. The Bowie-style \\"The Day\\" is light Rock (with existential questioning lyrics, written after the passing of his mother), while \\"Lie Down In Darkness\\" features gloomy soulful female vocals remniscent of tracks from \\"Play\\". \\"The Right Way\\" features languid female vocals over cascading keys and lush strings.<br /><br />There are a few Dancefloor moments; \\"Victoria Lucas\\" (with hummed vocals and which takes a while to build), the dramatic \\"After\\" (with vocodered vocals and Moby's juxtaposed with Middle Eastern-sounding harmonies), the Eurodisco \\"Blue Moon\\" (with male vocals), and the Giorgio Moroder-inspired \\"Sandpaper\\" (with repetitive sampled female vocals and available as a download on Amazon).<br /><br />As I earlier stated, \\"Destroyed\\" features enough contrast to make it devastating!

No seriously it is fantastic.<br />Inside this book is a progressing storyline that leave you never a dull minute, is a masterpiece.<br />There is enough fabulous snark that you could stir it with a stick, and moody plotting characters that pop in and out of the story all of the time.<br />Poor Atticus (no wealthy kick arse really) just wants some down time after two thousand years to sit back, brew at his tea shop, sell at his bookshop and hunt with his wolfhound. Is that too much for a guy to ask for, it might be when you are packing a hot sword lifted from a bygone war.<br />Hounded will keep you reading and enthralled in its characters. I am so happy that a book per month with be released so there is no year wait between books.<br />Want a great new fresh read that packs a punch, then get Hounded and you wont be left unsatisfied.

B004CIIXC8|5.0|Since lots of people have already pointed out many of the worthy aspects of Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank, I'll just mention a couple of other things that struck me. First of all: When you get this film I recommend watching the three short films first. These films cue you into Arnold's style and make your first dive into the Fish Tank an even more unsettling experience. The short films, Wasp, Dog and Milk, are each rooted in a very grim reality, and yet they are also filled with a shocking sort of poetry. Both Dog and Wasp have moments as dark as any horror film, made even darker through the images erupting out of such a well observed reality. They will begin to prepare you for the kinds of imagery that Andrea Arnold can pull out of the most mundane realities. For me the extraordinarily dark poetry of the near drowning scene is an artistic image of the highest order. After seeing what she did to the dog and the baby in the shorts I truly feared for the child's life at that moment. Andrea Arnold is simply fearless in building up a real situation into a true nightmare. I'll be waiting for her next film.
1593081545|4.0|Mansfield Park is the story of Fanny Price.  She is born to poor parents and is whisked off as a young girl to live with her wealthy aunt, uncle, and cousins - the Bertrams.<br /><br />She is miserable at first.  Shy and timid by nature, frightened, homesick, and continually lectured by her Aunt Norris about how she should be grateful, life is not pleasant for Fanny.  But things begin to change when her cousin Edmund shows kindness to her.  His friendship helps her adjust to her new home, broaden her mind, and become a lady.<br /><br />Their peaceful family life comes to an end when their father goes away on a lengthy business trip.  About the same time, Mary Crawford and her brother move to the area.  The young people strike up a friendship, and without the stabilizing influence of their father the Bertrams start to go down the wrong path.  Fanny is the only one who seems to realize the Crawfords are a bad influence.  But no one pays any attention to her.<br /><br />I won't mention how things turn out because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read this.<br /><br />This is not my favorite Austen, but I liked it very much.  In the beginning the treatment of Fanny both annoyed and depressed me.  However, as she begins to grow and become more confident, the book really took off for me and I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />There are a lot of sections in this book that sound like sermons - probably because a main character becomes a clergyman - and I can see how that would be hard going for some.  It's not as light and fun as other Austen novels.  But it is still a very good book and a must read for Austen fans.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is some unspecified time in the future. The United States no longer exists. In its place is Panem, which is comprised of twelve districts and an oppressive government that rules out of the Capitol. Katniss Everdeen, our teenaged narrator and heroine, lives in District 12, which appears to be located where West Virginia is today. Other reviews will surely give away more of the premise of the book, but I won't. I don't like to offer too many plot details in my reviews.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a thrilling and addictive piece of fiction that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The author definitely knows how to keep your attention and constantly keep you wanting more. It's the type of book that you won't want to put down.<br /><br />The novel is classified as a young adult book, and I don't disagree. It is true that there is quite a lot of violence in the book, but it is rather unrealistic violence that children brought up on video games are probably accustomed to. Still, there is a lot of killing. So if that bothers you regardless of the realism, then this is probably not a book for you. As far the sex goes, there isn't any. The most that the characters do is kiss, and even then it is very sweet without any trace of sexual tension. More to the point, there is something about this novel that makes it seem like a young adult one, but I can't seem to identify exactly what that is. Perhaps it's the simplicity, perhaps it's the unrealistic elements, perhaps it's the self-centeredness. I'm not sure what it is. But is does strike me as young adult, but not in a bad way, more in the sense that it straddles the fantastical realm of children and the cynical world of adults.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a very claustrophobic novel, both physically and mentally. As a reader, I felt trapped. District 12 is fenced off, and although Katniss wanders outside of the fence through a hole, it is clearly against the rules to do so. Also, once \\"The Hunger Games\\" begin, all of the characters are trapped inside \\"the arena\\". Not only are there physical boundaries, but the oppressive government is also restrictive, adding to the claustrophobia and feelings of being trapped.<br /><br />For me, The Hunger Games must not have made a huge impact on me, because I was quite indifferent about reading the rest of the series. A couple months passed before I read Catching Fire and Mockingjay, and I only read them because it was free to borrow them from my friend on the Kindle.<br /><br />Overall, the book is most definitely entertaining, and I'd recommend it based on that alone. The plot is fast-paced with surprising twists and turns. However, I found the book to be lacking in depth. Dystopian novels are usually written as a critique or commentary on today's world. The Hunger Games is no exception. It's clear what Suzanne Collins is commenting about - reality shows and war. But the book is neither powerful nor profound. In short, as fun as The Hunger Games is to read, it's not a book that will change the way you view the world.pped inside \\"the arena\\".

B0042816YK|3.0|The movie was good for its entertainment value such as: beautiful scenes of italy, bali and india, her unique outfits, and just an excuse to be lazy and watch someone else travel. So overall it was nice, just not realistic.     Now for the bad part. Its sooo fake. Its like a fairytale. Here's what they try to make us believe:  1) MONEY IS OPTIONAL  She allegedly got divorced and had no money. But yet, she manages to take a trip to 3 countries and stay there for several years?? Not once did she even get a job to support herself. She stayed in pretty nice places for it to be \\"free\\". She even had money to take italian classes from a hot tutor.    2) DESIGNER CLOTHES  How did she have the money? How did she have the time to go shopping? I didn't see her go shopping. Her wardrobe was very nice despite the fact that she only traveled with \\"one little bag\\". Not realistic at all! For a girl to carry such a small bag with  barely any clothes or makeup, they would not look like julia roberts who would wake up freshly made up and with perfect boticelli curls. And we cannot forget how clean she looked while in India and Bali.    3) GIRLS ARE SO NICE AND EASY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH  Not! In real life, girls couldn't care less about other girls. But in this movie, she makes girlfriends easily. And in all the cases, they approached her. She didn't have to do any effort. Its as if they knew she was the celebrity \\"julia roberts\\" even though shes \\"acting\\" like someone else. I'm sorry but in real life, girls are catty as can be!    4) LIFE IS PERFECT WHEN YOU TRAVEL  Nothing annoying or bad happened to her while she traveled. She wasn't mugged. She didn't really have a bad day. Things always worked out for her. That's not realistic. The only time something \\"bad\\" happened ended up being \\"good\\", like hurting her leg to meet the guy of her dreams.     5) GURUS ARE WAITING AROUND TO HELP WHITE AMERICAN GIRLS FIND THEMSELVES   Im not really sure what his intentions were. Exactly how was he benefiting from this relationship? Was he that lonely that she was his only friend? She only brought stress to the guru.    6) GAINING WEIGHT IN THE MOVIE MEANS WEIGHING 125LBS   The girl she met in Italy was complaining about gaining weight and she was so skinny. So they set out on a journey to find bigger jeans...whoa thats a great story. If that girl is fat, then I must be obese. I was laughing out loud when they were both in the dressing room trying to close her size 4 jeans on her obviously tiny body. It was sooo ridiculous because the jeans obviously fit her tiny ass. But they kept acting like she was the girl in the movie \\"Precious\\".    7) MEN ARE LINING UP  For us normal looking folk, men don't just appear the way they appear in this movie. If i  went to a crowded play, i certainly would not catch the eye of the lead character. 1) because its crowded 2) because i don't look like julia roberts  This movie is just an insight on what its like to be beautifully attractive.    8) WHAT THE HELL WAS SHE LOOKING FOR? DID SHE EVEN FIND IT?   I still don't know what she wanted in the first place. I mean, i just thought she wanted a long vacation. But isn't that what everyone wants? We just don't have the money like she did. She claimed she wanted peace. But how exactly? In the form of a man? I thought the movie would be a little deeper than that. I think she was just bored the whole time.     9) POOR LIZ, HER LIFE WAS SO AWFUL BEFORE THE TRIP!   They didn't convince me that her life was so bad before  She was in a mansion, friends, her cute husband, what was the problem? Well, they did'nt really show it if there was one. If it was an issue of editing, there were many other parts of the movie that i would have sacrificed so that they could add a scene about why she hated her life so much.    10) LIZ WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE TO LEAVER HER MARRIAGE OF 8 YEARS SO ABRUPTLY   I wonder if she even had a heartbeat. She didn't give him a chance to fix it. And she left halfway around the world. I don't think he was that bad. She acted like he abused her or something.    11) SHE'S NOT INDEPENDENT, BUT SHE THINKS SHE IS.....  Yeah, she did make the trip halfway around the world, BUT, she only makes decisions based on the guru/medicine healer's opinion. In the end, she has no mind of her own.     12) LACK OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT  james franco (david), richard and her husband didn't really have good character development. They all just disappear into the void.  13) How did Felipe fall in love with her so fast?  They barely just met. I can't figure this one out. Was it because felipes son told his dad that its time he have sex again?    14) POOR & MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS CAN'T HAVE ENLIGHTENMENT  Why? Because we don't have the money to take years off our jobs and go to 3 countries and go on vacation.  15) The guru/medicine healer really needed subtitles. I tried hard to understand a word he said.    16) THE TITLE OF THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN \\"SELFISH AROUND THE WORLD\\"  Liz is selfish, not because she is trying to find herself but because of the way she is with other people in this movie. She doesn't think of others while she is trying to find herself. They tried to make her seem so nice by giving the house to the family, but that was the only nice gesture. She didn't care about anyone else 's feelings.      HERE'S WHAT THE MOVIE HAS TO OFFER:  1)A scenic break from our mundane lives that last about 2 hours.   2)It will make you think its time to go on vacation.    3)Will make you want to cook or eat italian food  4)Its fun to make fun of this unrealistic movie    But that's all it is. Other than that, it was entertaining and i love julia roberts charisma and charm.   But don't expect to find your own enlightenment here.
0345522478|4.0|Our Hero (current name \\"Atticus O'Sullivan\\") is a 2000 yo Irish Druid, who just happens to look like a 20 something young athlete- with tribal tats and the whole nine yards.  Trying to keep out of trouble, he opens an occult bookstore & herb shop (no, not that herb!) in Arizona of all places.  Of course- trouble follows him home.<br /><br />At least at home he has his trusty wolfhound (who is a well done character in his own right, and gets a lot of the funny bits- I got quite a few chuckles out of Oberon's comments).<br /><br />Atticus manages to run into and even fight several of the Tuatha De Danann, along with the more usual vampires, trolls, werewolves, etc.<br /><br />My only quibble- what will the author do for an encore?  With Dresden and similar heroes we get to see power and character growth, pretty hard to do here. Anyway, it was a great read.
0316069353|5.0|I can understand why some reviewers were critical of the book itself instead of the price.( Wish those price complainers would find another formum for their bitching and leave this one for those who want to talk about the book). I am a lawyer, quite an old one, and have read countless books involving trials and legal proceedings and this book is the most accurate and realistic by far that I have ever encountered. I could  be used as an educational tool in law school. The tactices, strategies, court rulings, objections etc etc were right on and were totally engrossing to me. I loved it and would recomend it to any with an interest in such things. I never would have thought that Connely could produce another protagonist as captivating as Bosch, but he has done it and done it brilliantly and well.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|It would be 5 stars if Bon Scott was in it.  I guess I will have to wait for that one next month :)  The picture and sound were great.  After reading earlier reviews I was worried about the camera work but honestly, all the jumping around didn't bother me.  Great setlist but I can see how people may complain if they have other recent concerts on disk.
0064471047|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a book that took place during World War II. This book is about 4 children, Peter, Susan, Edward, and the youngest Lucy. It all starts when the children's mother sent them to live with a quirky professer who lived in in the country. During the children's stay Lucy, the youngest, finds a large wardrobe in an almost empty room. During a game of Hide-n-go-seek, Lucy decides to enter the wardrobe to hide. In the wardrobe, Lucy finds a magical world which is called Narnia. When Lucy tries to tell her siblings about the magical world but they don't believe her. After a couple of tries to get them into the wardrobe she succeeds and they all have an amazing adventure in Narnia. Their adventures include mystical characters, a majestic lion, and an evil white witch who turns people into stone. There are battles and also time of peace. There are nerve racking moments and times that make you feel relaxed. This book is an overall outstanding well written book that I can reconmmend for any age! To learn more about this book read it! C.S. Lewis is a phenomenal writer and really digs deep into his writting and an analogy of his faith in Jesus as the Savior.
1933308087|5.0|This is a fabulous book. Just what I was looking for. When you no longer need instructions and want something unusual this book has it. The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks Amazon for everything.
B004PGO25O|3.0|I found \\"Do The Work\\" to be a quick, easy read and certainly motivational, but I think it could have been done just as well in a ten-minute presentation. It seemed that the author had to really stretch the material to create a book. While the basic concept is good, I found myself just wanting it to end. I have no doubt that Steve Pressfield is an excellent motivator, but I felt I was hearing the same advice over and over--just phrased differently. Overall, I thought it was an average book that made some good points but became a bit tedious at times.
0300169787|5.0|When McQueen died, there seemed to be hole in fashion. One of the greatest creative minds had simply vanished and it felt like we had lost years of future innovation. Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty reminds us that although the man has past, his efforts and influence on sartorial innovation never will.    I read this entire tome in a single day. And having read it, I feel much more connected to McQueen than ever before. It is a publication that not only chronicles his life but, explores his processes, his techniques, his innovation and of course, his legacy.    And despite the collection of quotes, deep biographical writings and insight, this book is not so much about the words but, the images. The Met have captured the true essence of McQueen through visual displays of his aesthetic and mindset. From flowing gowns that look ethereal across a double page spread, to the finest detail of a mannequin's skin tone, it all resembles a dream, the surreal fantasy that McQueen bought the world.    This book, with its comprehensive look at the past and optimistic and exciting look into McQueen's future through Sarah Burton, is something you must really buy for yourself. I cannot be in New York for the exhibition but, have a little piece of the real McQueen with me. And my never ending admiration for him is enhanced through this book.    A great homage to the genius that was and ever will be, McQueen.

This book is an excellent description of mental illness, for example. It was published by Harvard Medical School, we suspect because most publishers turned it down.

0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It gives a fresh perspective on a topic that has long touched our hearts: the inexcusable treatment of men, women, and children during WWII that apparently was executed by others than the typical villains, the Germans.

We have gifted this book to our staff and our grown children--Everyone is reading Shawn's book and they are happier people.  Fun book to read, but serious stuff. When I do the excercises, my life is better.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I've watched this movie so much my kids are sick of it, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I enjoyed the switch in the familiar pattern of hero vs. villain.  For once, the bad guy won, and when he did, it wasn't anything like he hoped.  Deep down, Megamind was never a bad guy, which is why the beginning is so important to the movie.  It was fun to watch him morph from a bad guy into a good one.<br /><br />I especially liked how instead of the hero disguising himself as a normal person, it was the villain who did it.  Then he made a hero who turned out to be a truly evil villain.  At that point, he had to decide which he was going to be: the good guy or the bad guy.<br /><br />I loved the movie for several reasons.  One, the usual hero/villain movie took on an unexpected twist.  Two, the humor was great.  I know some people didn't think so, but I was laughing through most of it. An example is \\"You were right.  I was less right\\" as an apology. Even the subtle things in how Megamind eyed Metro Man's cape was funny.  Three, it's a clean movie.  There are no subtle sexual jokes.  This is a movie I was comfortable showing to my four sons who are ages 5-8.  Four, I loved the moral of the story.  Fate isn't something that is decided for us; it's what we choose for ourselves. I'm a firm believer that we have a hand in how our lives turn out by what we do.<br /><br />So this movie has a lot going for it, and though I've watched it enough to quote most of it, I'll be watching it again.
0756655307|4.0|i like this book because it has all the marvel character bios and for the new readers of marvel it's an excellent guide
0670022411|3.0|I was looking forward to this book after reading such great reviews but after reading nearly 600 pages I can say I'm disappointed that there was no resolution to even one part of the story. I wish I had known this was going to be part of a trilogy! Furthermore, the mundane details need to be left out. I don't give a crap what Diana is eating every 5 minutes! The romance needs work and the introduction of the final characters in the end was haphazard, confusing, disjointed, and made no sense to me. The book was entertaining at best but I'm left feeling cheated out of a proper ending. I'm feeling so jilted about it that I'm not sure I can invest in the 2nd book.

0425241505|5.0|In this new paranormal romance be prepared to be taken on a wild ride filled with action, shape-shifters and hot romance.<br />Pia Giovanni finds her life turned upside down as a forced favor from her ex leaves her on the run for stealing from the most powerful man in New York and Wyrkind, Dragos Cuelebre. Pia knows her days are numbered and flees the city with Dragos fast on her heels. Soon she's pulled into a supernatural rivalry battle and fighting off feelings for a man set out to make an example of her. To teach her and everyone that it's a really, really bad idea to steal from a dragon.<br />I really enjoyed Dragon Bound and the wild ride it took me on.  Pia was a funny down to earth heroin who was strong and wise enough to know when it was time for her to get out of doge.  The romance between Pia and Dragos was hot, stormy and exciting. I was just as enraptured by the chase as Dragos. I didn't know whether they would jump each others bones or fight to the death.<br />Dragos was thee alpha male, sexy and strong. I loved watching his world get turned around by the feisty Pia.<br />The adventure these two were on allowed for some great action scenes and world building also allowing for their relationship to grow and morph into something nether one of them expected.<br />Overall, Dragon Bound was a great start to The Elder Races series. Ms. Harrison created an engaging world filled with unique characters and situations that I can't wait to discover.

In it, he makes sure, and wants you to know, that the universe told him that everything is determined, robotic, and under control.<br /><br />Of course, Stephen Hawking never really published a book, the deterministic universe published it for him. He didn't have much of a choice in the matter. None of the idea's are his either. The collective known as 'Stephen Hawking' didn't have much to do with it, since everything from \todays weather patterns, you sneezing earlier this week, and your neighbors malfunctioning septic tank (poor guy) was determined at the start of the big bang.<br /><br />What started it and why remains the best kept secret since the resting place of the holy grail (calm down Dan Brown fans). And What started the thing that started the big bang remains even more elusive.<br /><br />The collective known as Stephen Hawking would like you to know that you are all biological robots. Everything is out of your control. You are mindless, and every thought, urge, or creative feeling you've ever had as been force fed to you by the all pervading and proven deterministic factors of the universe (COUGHchaostheory/quantumuncertaintyCOUGH).<br /><br />Conversely, Scientists have finally realized that in a deterministic universe, minus any spontaneity or chaos or freedom, all their scientific tests and rigor are completely meaningless. All their methods, notes, thoughts, intuitions, theories, so on and so forth, are force fed to them by the universe. They are not really committing themselves to research at all, just going along with their mindless robotic behavior, doing what they have been determined to do, and getting a chemical rush out of the &lt;span style=\\"font-style:italic;\\">thought&lt;/span> that they are pioneers of scientific truth.

0385507755|1.0|My sister who is 20 years older than me and watches Oprah regularly gave me this book years ago. I never read it because honestly living a drug out life for several years surrounding myself among the most hardcore drug addicts  and living the homeless life i had no need to read this book. I even lived with a Quadriplegic who was the most messed up addict i ever meet. Anyway a few weeks ago i saw this book on my self and read it. It is just plain CRAP. I wanted to put it down after a few pages, it was completely boring and seems to be completely made up. I had no idea it wasn't true, but i could tell instantly it was made up just by reading it. Then i found out there was a controversy about most of the book being untrue. Anyway another reviewer wrote that this was an amazing book even if untrue. Yeah freaking right, this book blows and isnt worth your time. There are a MILLION other books out there about the same topics that are 1000 times better than this Fake Cr*p.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|Who would have thought? One of Marvel's more difficult challenges to bring to the live action film turns out to be their best effort since the first Iron Man film. I know purist will have a hard time with Dr. Donald Blake not being anymore than a name and nothing to do with the God of Thunder here, but with the way this film ended, I can see an interesting way to introduce him as he should be.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br /> Now that the bridge from Asgard to Earth has been destroyed, maybe the only way for Thor to return to earth is to project his being into a earthling who is worthy?  and that someone will need a a certain item to conjure up the Norse God.(a staff maybe?) It would be nice if they could introduce Blake as Thor's alter ego to add some dimension to the role and give \\"old goldilocks\\" a breather.<br /><br />******END OF SPOILER******<br /><br />Now on to the film, it works! Mainly because the three H's (main actors) are exceptional in their roles. Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins are completely committed to their roles and they pull off what could have been a disaster. Portman is also very good, but I didn't feel she was irreplaceable, though quite nice to look at, she isn't given as much to do as she could have been if Thor's alter ego was involved.<br /><br />The action is great, but a little too sparse for my taste, with Thor's Mjolnir his impressive weapon of choice. I'm glad that they did use some of his signature uses such as the helicopter spinning hammer and various others.<br /><br />Hemsworth seems born for the role and I can't wait to see The Avengers movie..... as for Captain America? well, I am having a hard time with Chris Evans in the title role after he completely owned his role as the Human Torch. I'm mean really? wasn't there another blonde-ish guy with a great physique they could find to play Captain America? He seems a little boy-ish to be playing Cap. I guess I'll have my answers in a couple of months.<br /><br />Thor isn't perfect, but it is everything it needs to be and more. It is one of the most entertaining comic book films of all time. I saw this at IMAX in 3-D and it looked great, I'm not completely sold on 3-D, but it has improved a great deal.nd more. It is one of the most entertaining comic book films of all time.

B00006AW2L|5.0|Rock & Stones Fans...Don't hesitate buy this album!!!  A classic...with in my opinion the greatest Rolling Stones song...\\"Under My Thumb\\"...right up there with \\"Satisfaction\\"...\\"Paint It Black\\"...another totally original classic.  Brian Jones was still around for this Album, and his influences can be seen everywhere.  A dedicated Blues Afficionado  Brian Jones was \\"squeezed out\\"  a couple of years later in order for the Stones to go in a more \\"Pop\\" oriented direction. A true \\"guitar genius\\"; he was good friends with the Beatles who gave the Stones their first hit...\\"I wanna be your Man\\" way back when.  The Stones & the Beatles as the two greatest Rock Bands out of England at the time remained close friendly competitors, and the release of this album inspired the Beatles to raise their competitive game and come out with \\"Revolver\\".<br />  John Lennon was always envious of the Stones success, and often lamented that the Beatles...\\"sold out\\" to wear funny suits, and clean up their image under Brian Epstein's influence.  The Stones were the natural \\"Organic\\" grunge rock band that the Beatles were, and wanted to be.  \\"Flight #505\\" was strongly influenced (if not totally ripped off from) Flight#909 often played live by the Beatles in the early days, but not included in an Album until \\"Let It Be\\".<br />  Even true younger Rolling Stones fans not really acquainted with their early work will find some great surprises here in the hidden gems like \\"Stupid Girl\\", and \\"I Am Waiting\\", which rarely appeared in later concert performances.<br />  A great Album...A great group...great surprises...Buy It!!!<br /><br />JMP

B00475AYJQ|3.0|Like so many others, I am a huge (huge) fan of In the Name of the Wind. In fact, it is one of only a couple of non-classic novels that I've read twice.<br /><br />But man I was tired of Kvothe by the end of this book. And like so many others, I felt like a lot of time was spent not really advancing the story. I got so sick of Denna that I thought I'd puke if she showed up again. The thought of how much more of her will have to be in the next book fills me with dread.<br /><br />Fortunately, there was not much Ambrose in this one but I know he'll be back to plague us all in the next one. Woe, woe, and more woe.<br /><br />Why is Kvothe so pathetic now? Who knows. But once again he gets his butt kicked. And all it did was piss me off more. Self-loathing sucks in the real world and it especially sucks when I paid for the priviledge of being subjected to it. I guess I just like my heroes strong. A little angst is ok but Kvothe is turning into a pathetic little twit.<br /><br />In case you haven't figured it out, I like the Kvothe in the first novel. But this one kinda sucked and all I see is more sucking. I have this horrible suspicion that this thing is not going to end well and I think that sucks most of all. Imagine reading all of this noise and ending up with some kind of Thomas Covenant ending. This novel in no way impressed me as much as the first. In fact, at one point, I looked up and said \\"Why am I doing this?\\" Dread, dread, and more dread.<br /><br />Redeeming qualities: Bast - until a confusing moment in the last chapter. I think I get it but boy - kinda out of the blue! The Chronicler - I really like the guy. Kvothe's friends - Awesome. Elodin, Kilvin, and Exla Dal - never get tired of them. And there are three or four scenes that almost make the 1000+ pages worthwhile. Almost. ONE THOUSAND PLUS PAGES. Wow.

B0048FQ0HU|5.0|No matter what your religious background may be, no one can deny the fact that positive thinking can change lives.  Rhonda Byrne has learned much since releasing \\"The Secret\\" and I feel like \\"The Power\\" expands upon and better explains many points that created such controversy. I have done much reading over the past several years and understand the concept in great detail. There have been many people, over centuries (maybe before), that have also come to similar conclusions concerning the Law of Attraction.  I, myself, am a firm believer and have had miracles occur in my own life.  Call it the power of God or the universe or Abraham or any name you will.   In my humble opinion,there is nothing for anyone to really be offended by here.   If you choose to be offended; you  are in a sense throwing the baby out with the bath water and missing the whole point. :) I enjoy listening to these CDs in the car.....reminding me to be thankful for all of the blessings that I have and to remember to always maintain a positive attitude in order to truly live a rich & full life.  Using a positive and loving attitude to attract good health, the right people, opportunities and resources makes perfect sense. It sure beats using a negative attitude to attract the things we do not want or are not good for us.  You don't have to agree with every single point, in order to get something special out of these CDs/this book.  Give it a listen, think about it and then listen to it again and again until it sinks in.

B004UJ6YNO|5.0|i'm not going to give a long drawn out review of each song, i like to let people listen and make their own opinion about each song, we all like different things, so i'm just going to keep it simple and rate the album overall. ITS WONDERFUL! Her voice is amazing, i was so surprised by it, and the song writing is clever, and unique, unlike anything i've ever heard before. it still bottles my mind how some people from London sing with no accent. out of the 13 songs on the album there is only one song that i OCCASIONALLY skip. if you're already a fan of Jessie J and you know her stuff, buying this album should be a no brainer. But if you're like me, [i just heard about her a month ago] and you're just looking for some new music to listen to this is a perfect buy. she's great<br /><br />Personal Favorite songs: Nobody's Perfect, Big White Room, Casualty of Love, Rainbow, Do It Like A Dude, I Need This, Who You Are.<br /><br />Songs sometimes skip: Mamma Knows Best
1401924352|3.0|I'm in my 50's, and I was a little dissappointed at how 'light' the writing in this book seemed.     It has beautiful photos, inspiring quotes, and a posistive outlook. And it is excellent for teenage girls, the target audience for this book. I actually gave my copy to my neice, and she loved it!
0312600844|2.0|It has been a long time since I have read the popular, new fiction of the day. I was not sure if my plodding pace through this book was owing to the slow development of the book (which, I believe, is an undeniable feature of this book) or if it could more rightly be attributed to me. But, as I finished this book months after having first picked it up, I was satisfied.     I would not recommend this book to anyone, but I do not feel cheated for having finished it. The characters were entertaining. I've seen in other reviews some saying that the characters were not believable. That's not entirely true. The characters are not necessarily realistic, but they are believable. And maybe Mr. Franzen was conscious of that.     I do think that this book was almost an academic exercise, more accurately characterized as a commentary with characters than a strict novel. But perhaps that is what some people are looking for in a read. That is why, I think, the reviews of this book are so mixed: it really depends upon what you expect to find in a read. If you are looking for a nicely packaged narrative with accessible characters, I do no think this it.     One thing that I still cannot wrap my mind around is the autobiography by Patty that is wrapped within the rest of the book. It seems contrived to have this parsed out from the rest of the book when the storytelling voice does not change enough to have this sort of division. Of course, what is contained in the autobiography is a valuable part of the book, but I still found myself perplexed on why Mr. Franzen chose this sort of arrangement.

0767903862|5.0|I recently have been on a reading jag involving inhaling as many of Bill Bryson's books as possible. The latest milestone is his tour de force of Australia entitled &#34;Down Under.&#34; Any travel writer - and Bryson is far more than a &#34;mere&#34; travel writer - who is able to make me want to book the next flight on Qantas is someone worth reading. As he does in all of his books, Bryson uses his travels through Australia to feed the reader delicious and gritty morsels of history, culture and human interest.  I was particularly motivated to read this book because I have many friends and clients in Australia, and hope to visit there in 2017.<br /><br />I laughed throughout my reading of this book as Bryson relayed story after story of adventures and misadventures as he traveled thousands of miles in the Land Down Under.<br /><br />The reviewer for the New York Times said it perfectly: &#34;If there is one book with which to get oriented before departure or en route to Australia, this is it.<br /><br />Allow me to share a brief excerpt from this work to give you a small taste of Bryson's style as he reacts to the antipodian continent and culture:<br /><br />Driving in a remote part of the Outback, Bryson found that the only radio station whose signal he could now receive was broadcasting an interminable cricket match. The author's send-up of the commentator's dialogue had me howling with delight.<br /><br />&#34;'Pritchard begins his long run in from short stump. He bowls and . . .oh, he's out! Yes, he's got him. Longwilley is caught leg-before in middle slops by Grattan. Well, now, what do you make of that, Neville?'<br /><br />'That's definitely one for the books, Bruce. I don't think I've seen offside medium-slow-fast-pace bowling to match it since Baden-Powell took Rangachangabanga for a maiden ovary at Bangalore in 1948.'<br /><br />I had stumbled into the surreal and rewarding world of cricket on the radio.<br /><br />After years of patient study (and with cricket there can be no other kind) I have decided that there is nothing wrong with the game that the introduction of golf carts wouldn't fix in a hurry. It is not true that the English invented cricket as a way of making all other human endeavors look interesting and lively, that was merely an unintended side effect. I do not wish to denigrate a sport that is enjoyed by millions, some of them awake and facing the right way, but it is an odd game. It is the only sport that incorporates meal breaks. It is the only sport that shares its name with an insect. It is the only sport in which spectators burn as many calories as players - more if they are moderately restless. It is the only competitive activity of any type, other than perhaps baking, in which you can dress in white from head to toe and be as clean at the end of the day as you were at the beginning.&#34;<br /><br />And so it goes for almost 400 rollicking pages. If you have not yet been exposed to the mind and pen of Bill Bryson, I invite you to take the plunge. Come on in; the water is fine. If you are already a fan, then add this to your long list of treasured Bryson titles.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Alth the game that the introduction of golf carts wouldn't fix in a hurry.

1594202710|5.0|Prior to the publication of this book the definitive resource on China was Jonathan Spence's \\"In Search of Modern China\\". Spence the Yale Professor, is still indispensible to a modern understanding of this remarkable country. Now there is a second more up to date source and that is Henry Kissinger. The former Secretary of State who is now 88 years fortunately has taken the time to put together this incredible piece of work that only he could have created.<br /><br />The book demonstrates the necessity of having lived a very long productive life and generating wisdom capable of distilling his understanding of a country down to a 530 page volume of work. It is as good as any of his previous works (13 with this one) and for my money I now put this book in Kissinger's top three, along with WHITE HOUSE YEARS and DIPLOMACY.<br /><br />First the MECHANICS of the Book<br /><br />If you are going to read the hard copy as opposed to digital, you are in for a treat. The font is beautiful, and the paper used to print the volume is delicious. I say this because if you are a heavy reader; you really appreciate turning the pages of beautifully textured pages. I annotate all of my books, writing in margins, in the back on blank pages and just about everywhere, and I love writing on beautiful page that take the ink nicely. This book was crafted professionally as good as it gets.<br /><br />The ORGANIZATION of On China<br /><br />The Secretary has made 40 trips to China in his lifetime, enough that he should be the Honorary Ambassador to the country. He is thoroughly infused in the history of China, and he certainly does give you the history. There are 18 chapters plus an epilogue spread over 531 pages. There are 36 pages of footnotes and it is obvious that the Secretary had considerable organizational help with the footnotes which is to be expected.<br />The first three chapters or 91 pages are devoted to the nation's history and Kissinger gets it right. I have made many trips to China, but I still have problems with the language. When you read any book on China, you will have problems with pronunciation. What I do is quickly scan the book writing down 50 or a 100 names or terms I can't pronounce, and then head for the first Chinese restaurant in town, and ask for help with the words. People love to help, especially when you are taking an interest in their culture and language.<br /><br />The guts of the book begins on page 91 or Chapter 4 which is Mao's Continuous Revolution. This chapter is superb and superbly written. If you study American China relations, the question that is always stipulated is whether or not America lost China in 1949. Kissinger correctly reminds us that China might never have been ours to lose, so we asking the wrong question.<br /><br />Mao always believed that the Confucian order had for thousands of years kept China a weak China. Confucius preached HARMONY, and Mao believed that progress could only come from brutal confrontations both in China and with outside adversaries for China to advance. Mao also believed that these confrontations would happen naturally, but if they did not, he was not beyond creating confrontations even if they had to be within the Communist party to kept progress going, as he understood progress.<br /><br />Chapter 6 which deals with China Confronts Both Superpowers is another section that only Kissinger could have written. It is here that China confronts the Soviet Union creating the Sino-Soviet split, and the United States with the Taiwan Strait Crisis. The chapter is riveting, and will affect and change your understanding of history.<br /><br />MY ANALYSIS<br /><br />The book is indispensible. You cannot understand China and modern Asia without having this book under your belt. One would have to be foolish to visit China and not read this book first to truly benefit from such a trip. Mao was famous for the Long March, and this book is a long journey for the reader but it is very rewarding. The Secretary takes us through the Road to Reconciliation in Chapter 8, and then the first encounters with Nixon, himself and the Chinese leadership in Chapter 9.<br /><br />It is a fascinating portrayal of power meeting power head to head, and the respect that even enemies can hold for each other. It is now generally accepted that only Nixon the hardened right winger could have opened the door to China and brought the American people along with him, because he Nixon was viewed as tough. Perhaps in a decade or two, Harvard will accept what most historians have already accepted.<br /><br />In Chapter 11 we witness the End of the Mao Era. Zhou Enlai falls and Deng's first return to power begins. Kissinger loves writing about Deng and calls him the indestructible Deng throughout chapter 12. Keep in mind that it was Deng who opened up modern China and began the reforms that were necessary for China to assert itself years later internationally and economically.<br /><br />For those readers that know very little of China, this book is a whirlwind tour of a country fast gaining hegemony over Asia.  You need to read Chapter 13 on the Third Viet Nam to understand how China is capable of dealing with its neighbors. Had we handled Viet Nam this way, the outcome and history would have been different.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Henry Kissinger ON CHINA is destined to become a best seller and in the process will greatly help an America that knows very little about China except for newspapers, to understand not just the history of this vital country, but its future and the nexus of that future with America's future. No one can ignore China, so the sooner we as Americans gain the understanding that we need to make intelligent decisions, the better off we will all be. If you have an interest in China whatsoever, run to read this book, and do not put it down until you are finished with it. Good luck and thank you for reading this review.<br /><br />Richard C. Stoyeck<br /><br />ASSIDE:<br /><br />I will share something extraordinary with you. When you read a book like this, you will have a better understanding of China than 98% of the people living in China and 95% of the Chinese people living in America. I am still shocked when I meet Chinese people in this country young and old who have next to no understanding of Chinese history prior to Mao. They do not know the name Sun Yat-sen, or even Zhou Enlai, and forget about the Cultural Revolution unless they lived through it. Even the tragedy of Tiananmen Square is fast fading from memory.<br /><br />It reminds me of German history in the post Hitler period. Anybody in Germany who was educated post 1950 has very little to no understanding of the Hitler period. It is simply glossed over as a dark period in German history; the teachers do not know what to say. Just amazing.conciliation in Chapter 8, and then the first encounters with Nixon, himself and the Chinese leadership in Chapter 9.

B004DK5CW4|3.0|Did not live up to my expectations that i got from the trailer. At times boring and too long but it had a few good toutching scenes.
B0030L0AOC|2.0|If you are looking for a weird, depressing story, well you've found it. This book definitely makes you want to get a blade and cut your veins, not because you are a sad, lonely person but because you'll get bored to death. It all begins with this boy getting a mysterious box with a few tapes, that describe the death of a girl he knew, he mentions all the people that in a way helped her to make her decision of commiting suicide. If you have crazy, suicidal teenagers at home, this book is not for them but if you are a normal person with nothing to do then by all means read this boring book and see what I saw.

1594202710|4.0|Reading On China brought back memories of the Nixon years, those winters and summers of our discontent that straddled the 1960's and 70's. Henry Kissinger, as national security adviser and then secretary of state, spent much of that time toasting foreign leaders, zipping back and forth across the globe, bending the president's ear, and occasionally expressing a wish that he should be president himself. The author of a long line of books, Mr. Kissinger maintains a prodigious output of words, a decades-long logorrhea that focuses on foreign affairs, but also covers history, culture, and religion. He shows great insight and a comprehensive grasp of international relations, all the while adhering to his pragmatic realpolitik approach. The book is well written, well organized, occasionally pedantic, but usually quite engaging. I hesitate to say this of a serious work that runs 530 pages, but it is a fairly entertaining read. Kissinger provides perspective and insight into the enigmatic nation that is rising in power just as rapidly as the US is falling.<br /><br />From the first run-on sentence of the prologue to the last sonorous snippet of  final advice, this book is a lengthy, detail heavy and ultimately revealing study of American foreign relations during the past 60 years. The author was a witness to some of the central events of that relationship, during the Nixon and Ford administrations, and although he was shut out by Jimmy Carter, he maintains a presence in those relations even now. His recollections of personal conversations, based upon his own notes, constitutes a valuable source for historians, and an educational experience for all readers.<br /><br />The first time that I met Henry Kissinger, he seemed completely out of his element. Engaged in a mundane domestic task in a suburban Boston neighborhood, he seemed to be in discomfort, obvious even to a seven year old like me. Ironically, he would soon be putting foreign dignitaries at ease with his wit and charm. My father told us that he was a \\"Harvard professor,\\" a phrase spoken with derision and dismissal. The neighbors were shocked when he became a national figure. Little did we guess that the diminutive figure with the old world demeanor and rumpled business suit harbored a sizeable intellect, a mighty pen, and an even more sizeable ego. The ego still comes through in his writing, but the benefits of this book far outweigh the minor drawbacks. I recommend it to all who want to understand China better. I believe that it will become essential reading for those who will have to deal with China, a group which includes just about everyone.ld us that he was a \\"Harvard professor,\\" a phrase spoken with derision and dismissal.

B004J4WN0I|4.0|I think what appeals to me the most about Hearne's debut is that it doesn't feel like his first novel. In fact, the ease with which he allows the reader to slip into Atticus's world makes this seem like it's not even the first in a series.<br /><br />\\"Hounded\\" blends a lot of the old tropes in a new and dynamic way and Hearne does this without boring the reader with tons of exposition nor assuming that one would be familiar with all the name-dropping that occurs. Instead, Atticus doles out the necessary backstory and legends as needed with a snarky wit that manages to make all the history lessons accessible without dumbing them down.<br /><br />The surprising thing for me was how quickly things started off. At first, from what Atticus explains of his life and how determined he is to stay off the radar of the Fae, I expected that everything would be dragged out slowly and painfully. But just when that seems to be the case things ratchet into high gear. Though, Atticus does his best to not play along for the majority of the book and in fact only shows some active initiative in driving the plot when there is no other choice. All this is understandable and very well developed throughout the book, but it's not only Atticus who was a bit ruffled by the fact so much of what occurred to propel him forward was masterminded by others. In a world where every imaginable deity exists I suppose this is only to be expected, but it didn't really sit right for me and I'm curious to see if in future books Atticus remains as irked about it all as I am.<br /><br />The subplots are usually the more ignorable parts of a story for me and when they aren't it's usually speaks to how weak the main plot is. However, I rather enjoyed the lighter side of this novel and I can credit all of that to Oberon who is absolutely adorable and endearing. I don't know if it was just a Kindle thing, though that had all his \\"dialogue\\" be in less and greater than symbols, but I found it sort of jarring to read and not the best method of denoting his thoughts. I also liked that he wasn't just comic relief or even merely a sidekick, but a true companion for Atticus. The fact that he ends up in the damsel in distress role towards the end of the book seems a bit off in an amusing way, but Hearne manages to make it work without being overly cheesy.<br /><br />Essentially, this was a quick, fun, whirlwind of a read and my interest is certainly piqued for further adventures in Atticus's world. Likewise, I'm equally enthusiastic to read more from Hearne.od of denoting his thoughts. I also liked that he wasn't just comic relief or even merely a sidekick, but a true companion for Atticus.

1594202710|4.0|\\"On China\\" by Dr. Henry Kissinger is a non-fiction book in which the famous states­man recounts and advises on the future of Chi­nese diplo­macy with the west.<br /><br />Dr. Henry Kissinger writes at length about the coun­try he has known for decades. Recount­ing Chi­nese his­tory and cul­ture, Kissinger exam­ines how China sees itself and the out­side world.<br /><br />Dr. Kissinger exam­ines key episodes in Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy, from hun­dreds of years ago to cur­rent events with empha­sis on the rise of Mao Zedong.<br /><br />One of the things which always fas­ci­nates me when it comes to polit­i­cal books is how deci­sions are made behind closed doors, the diplo­macy, arm twist­ing and walk­ing on tight wires which are the bane of for­eign pol­icy makes around the world. In his book \\"On China\\", Dr. Kissinger explains some of this process which I find so fascinating.<br /><br />The book, which draws exten­sively from Dr. Kissinger's per­sonal expe­ri­ence, starts with an intro­duc­tion to ancient Chi­nese cul­ture and for­eign pol­icy. Chi­nese cul­ture has a lot of bear­ing on the Chi­nese diplo­mats' way of think­ing and state­craft. As Dr. Kissinger found out, that was the key to under­stand­ing and nego­ti­at­ing with the Chinese.<br /><br />I enjoyed read­ing this book and get­ting, what seems to me, insight­ful and insider's infor­ma­tion. How­ever, this is one tough book to read. Lots of infor­ma­tion is thrown the reader's way, many nuances and names are being recalled, all the while ref­er­enc­ing thou­sands of years of Chi­nese his­tory which cul­mi­nates at the nego­ti­a­tions table.<br /><br />Dr. Kissinger writes about the Chi­nese insti­tu­tions and the think­ing of Chi­nese diplo­mats when cre­at­ing pol­icy from ear­lier encoun­ters with Euro­pean pow­ers, the rise of com­mu­nism in the Soviet Union and to the break­down of that alliance. Mr. Kissinger man­ages to tackle sen­si­tive sub­ject like the Korean War and the Tianan­men Square crack­down through ele­gant writ­ing explain­ing US-Chino rela­tions.  As an added bonus, Dr. Kissinger ana­lyzes Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaop­ing, two of the People's Repub­lic most engag­ing fig­ures and com­pares their vision for China's future.<br /><br />The book fol­lows the diplo­macy tri­als, errors and suc­cess while break­ing many myths which until now only priv­i­leged diplo­mats were aware of. A fas­ci­nat­ing book which I felt priv­i­leged to read.orean War and the Tianan­men Square crack­down through ele­gant writ­ing explain­ing US-Chino rela­tions.

Simon Singh has written a great narrative on the history of cryptography, and it was able to captivate my interest from start to end. I feel like I have a better understanding and appreciation for the security mechanisms we use day to day. I imagine this would also be a very good read for anyone doing a security certification (Security+, CCNA Security, CISSP) because it transforms a bunch of charts on a set of notes into a story that better explains the evolution of security.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After hearing a million and a half praises for this book, I gave in and bought it.  I could not put the bloody book down...it had me hooked from the first page! I think it's incredibly well written and just... brilliant. The storyline, the characters, the ending...  I loved every second of it. Can't wait to read Catching Fire!     I know a lot of people like me are thinking about reading it, or maybe not. Trust me on this: READ IT. It will blow your face off. You won't regret it.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Excellent....does seem to be worth the difference in money from the off-brand, tho I didn't have a problem with the off-brand I used on a different camera.  This tho, does have a very nice feel and fit :)
0312600844|2.0|I could not relate very well to the  motivations or thoughts of the characters; it also seemed that the author's pretentiousness showed through his characters.  I thought it might would go away if I kept reading, but it annoyingly persisted throughout the whole book.. It seems like he was writing this thinking it to be the next Great American Novel, and he had some magical pulse on the post-modern reader's sensibilities, with an expert's understanding of how people think or ought to think (ugh).  I really hated all the characters:  Patty, Richard, and even Walter.  I thought they were one dimensional, non realistic, and driven too much by their sexual impulses.  Since when is everything just a sex party? It seems the characters wished for and had sex, every damn second of the day. Is this the start of some new subtle \\"magical sexual realism\\" genre where sex is pervasive and as all encompassing as the very breath we take? Or is it just the author thinking of nothing more interesting to keep the reader interested in, than mentioning sex every other page?  I think the latter, the former being too generous an excuse for tired subject matter.  I am not even conservative or anything, and am not squeamish about these things, but it made for an uninteresting and annoying novel, thats all.      Also, the characters are way too self-absorbed and it seemed that to make up for this, he then went in the way opposite direction and went into little political tirades about environmentalism that were perhaps were meant to balance the self-absorption part in some of his characters.  This made the characters seem too uneven and too stitched together like a patchwork ... For example Walter with his nature loving side and very pro-environmental edge, and then his self-absorption.  Its like characters are too driven by emotion, and had no actual reasoning behind their beliefs.  It is this commenters opinion that you can not have characters who run completely on self-absorbed reasons.  Sometimes, people really do do things out of externally inspired motivations (philosophy, reflection, reading other's thoughts, etc.).      The author also seems to have enough literary tricks to keep you hooked on his story narrative.   Then it dawned on me.. the story hooks you into it the same way a crappy movie you watch late at night does, it contains enough sex scenes or hidden twists to stop you from completely changing the channel/putting down the book.     As for the actual content, the characters were too one dimensional, and too driven by sex.  I'm sorry, I understand we all have an \\"ID\\"/sexual side to us(metaphorically) that desires to fornicate, but to make almost every motivation due to this desire, gets really old really fast and seems to just appeal to people's lowest common denominator.  I am not averse to sex, but the way it is employed seems like there was not much he was trying to say or show with his characters except we are driven by the impulse to have sex and this \\"screws us over\\" (pun intended).  I think the motivations in his characters are inordinately dominated by these instincts... You didn't need to rehash Freud in this 562 compendium to make me understand the power of sexual desire.  Also, this seems to be old schtick.. 19th century Victorian and romance rags exploited this sensibility years ago, with less graphic and more metaphorical language.  I can see this book appealing to a female demographic in the same emotionally driven, soap opera way. Since this is just another modern soap opera, like one of those cheap Victorian romances I can see why it is endorsed by the sickening likes of the Opera book club and the demographic who read books from said club.          Also, after this book I did not feel I had a better understanding of humanity, the world, or myself.. Nor was it a light-hearted fun read.  Mostly, my overall emotional response to this book is the feeling that I swam in a pool of fetid, septic water and cannot quite get ridof the grime or stench.  In other words, this doesn't add anything to my worldview, and I feel not the better for reading it.    If you want a good drama with much actual interesting philosophical themes, drama, what it means to be human, love, etc.. but with interesting character development and no need for an overemphasis on sex to draw the reader's basic instincts and actually explores the themes of meaning read Irvin Yalom's The Schopenhauer Cure.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|I have always loved the power in some movie and trailer music but never knew it existed in album form.  I stumbled upon this collection by what I thought was a random accident but turns out it was just what I was looking for!  I read the reviews, saw the ratings, sampled, and loaded it onto my amazon cloud.  I have others at work who will buy it because they heard it playing at my desk...  all guys, much to my dismay.  Personally, I plan on having some epic cooking sessions with this blasting in the background!
0743437497|4.0|Stephen King's greatest accomplishment in The Shining is the fusion of great literary elements, such as extremely realistic, sympathetic characters and a poignant, emotional ending, with a story that is don't-read-it-alone-at-night scary. King has you feeling deeply for the entire Torrance family and jumping at every noise at the same time.    Jack Torrance is a struggling writer. He's struggling with his writing, struggling with his marriage, struggling to make ends meet and struggling to stay off the bottle. When he receives an offer for a job as a winter caretaker for the Overlook hotel, he sees an opportunity to redeem himself professionally, financially, and most importantly- personally. But when the hotel turns out to have a checkered past and to itself be an evil entity, Jack and his family are threatened with destruction.    The Shining is very entertaining and I recommend it even if you've seen the movie (they are significantly different and most would agree that the book is better). It's not without flaws: the beginning does drag a bit and King leaves some nagging questions unanswered. But all in all The Shining is definitely a worthwhile read.     I am very torn about rating The Shining because in so many ways it deserves 5 stars. But at the end of the day, it's not can't-put-it-down good (and much of King's work definitely is), so I gave it 4 stars.
B001AQT11M|1.0|I have ordered a DVD to play in Australia, however they only play sound and there is no picture.  I complained several times, but nearly two months later nothing has happend to replace it.  Got one reply that they will look into it, never heard anything again.  NOT HAPPY.  WON'T BUY AGAIN.  I have to rate this item with a minimum of 1 star, it should not get any stars.  I have also bought a 2-DVD Lion King, the movie DVD has the same problem, the second (extra DVD with songs) is good.  How odd????    Once you have bought from Amazon, there is no way you will get your money back or a replacement if goods are not up to standard.

B000O5B5FK|1.0|I was looking for this album since I heard \\"Anesthetize\\", I think it's a masterpiece. I love progressive (rock and metal), Opeth is my favourite band, and PT keeps too much relation with Opeth, and this was the first record that I was going to buy of PT. I bought this \\"import\\" version, and if you see the product details, it says that this CD is under the label Roadrunner Records UK. Well, I was surprised and upset when I found that the CD that Amazon shipped to me, was made in Argentina, not UK as in the details is shown. I hold nothing against Argentina, is just that I wanted to buy the European original edition, not the Argentina edition, I can find the last one in my country easily. I asked for a change of my product, and guess what?, they sent me the same CD made in Argentina. I'm not sure if it was a joke or what, and now I am waiting for my money refund, I don't have my CD, and suffering to send back the wrong items to Amazon. If you want to get the original european version, don't buy this.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I bought this album because of \\"The Cave\\" and \\"Little Lion Man\\", and now those are not even my favorites any more.  This album is so beautiful.

You can't go wrong in buying this.
0767821769|1.0|'Stepmom' features the conflict between the ex (Susan Sarandon) and her replacement (Julia Roberts), augmented by the childrens' natural loyalties to their mother. Lots of tart-tongued dialogue in the beginning, with preventable and meaningless conflicts at the PTA, the home, etc. Eventually they come together, drawn by the ex's slow death from cancer. Maudlin, boring, and way too long.

B001DMJ9VA|5.0|This collector's Set is a great performance by Rod. Only one thing i had to return it because on the seller page it does not mention the Region for the DVD and it would not play for me. It's not a Region 1 DVD. I suspect it's an import and some other Region that may be international.<br /><br />The Music is a Exceptional Live performance by Rod. It's a shame i could not keep the set because of the DVD that i could not watch.

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I picked up a free iTunes download card from Starbucks, which was for Adele's Rumor Has It. I fell in love with the gutsy, honest singing style she brings forth; at the same time, my spouse discovered Rolling In The Deep, another honest, heartfelt song.  I purchased her album, 21, and wasn't disappointed. An entire album from this young lady, full of honest emotion backed with bluesy music that only adds to her voice, never detracts from it.   My favorite songs from this album are Rumor Has It, Rolling In The Deep, and Set Fire To The Rain. I don't skip over any of the other songs, but I definitely increase the volume when these play.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Larsson has upped the ante with this latest installment in the Dragon Tattoo series, and in a sense has matured and widened the scope of the story.  In the first book, we were introduced to a quirky, dark murder mystery; the second brought on organised crime elements, and the final chapter features government departments, and an enemy of the state type scenario and a sweeping cast with wide ranging repercussions.<br /><br />One can't help draw Jason Bourne-type parallels, but in a good way - this story is breathtakingly fast paced, intriguing in complexity and heavy on the action and suspense.  A very enjoyable read and great conclusion to the series.
157270036X|5.0|Roses Pritchard is one of the best audio actresses I have ever heard! She uses a different voice for each character, does not slow down so that the listening is boring, and absolutely keeps the attention of the listener! The first time I ever saw this product for sale the cost was $250. It is now a much more affordable (under $40) amount. My only concern is that it is only available in cassette form. Perhaps soon they will release a CD version. That would make a wonderful product almost perfect!
0316056863|3.0|I love Tina Fey - don't get me wrong.  But this book - an autobiography supposedly - reveals very little.  There are a lot of \\"cheats\\":  samples of scripts for example which were just page fillers.  I would have liked to know her first writing successes and who taught her or influenced her - her first well-received work, and perhaps a failure that was a learning opportunity.  I'd like to know more about her mother - who is barely mentioned - and her sibling(s).  Are they writers too?  If no one in her family showed a talent for writing, what made her start?  Why did she join an improv group?  How did she meet her husband?  Everybody loves a great love story!  Anyway - I still love her and think she's brilliant, but this book was a bit of a disappointment.
B000002H38|5.0|In an interview with a smooth jazz radio station, Anita expressed how she felt like an outcast as a child because of her voice being deeper than most of her female counterparts.  Artists like Sarah Vaughn, who also had a deep voice, would instill confidence in Anita to pursue her love in music.  When 'Rapture' dropped in 1985, you could start to see the tables turn from soprano to baritone.  Suddenly, R & B singers were coming out the woodworks that juxtaposed falsetto.  This album played a key role in all of that.  \\"Compositions\\" is regarded as her biggest artistic achievement, \\"Giving You The Best That I Got\\" may have been her coolest, but \\"Rapture\\" was the most explosive.  It's almost scary how much control Anita has with her vocal pitch.  Usually, a singer will hear the music and the mood of the melody will guide the singer as to what lyrics will match up.  Anita has such a control with her sound that it's almost as if the music is made to command to her vocal presence.  Check out the beginning of \\"Caught Up In The Rapture\\" and the end of \\"Been So Long\\".  Even improvising with jazz-scatting she is able to give you that wow factor.  The music complements beautifully.  There are lush piano keys, misty soundscapes, and sweet as wine bass lines.  Not only can this album set a romantic mood but it's also great riding music.  Personally, I feel that every song could have been a single because I don't see how any song would have negatively impacted the records momentum.  A seminal recording in my book.
B000FC1AOI|5.0|When I find a book I really like I tend to dive in head first and don't look up until I'm finished.  That's exactly what I did with this book.  It's 20X better than the movie and made me laugh and cry throughout.
B000021Y7X|5.0|The Talking Heads have been known to set very high standards when it comes to live performances.  On \\"Stop Making Sense\\", they take risks from running around on stage with guitars in hand, doing strange dances, balancing and catching a pole with a lamp shade, and much more.  It's sounds unorthodox now but the show is executed well.  Well enough to raise the bar almost unfairly high.  What surprised me was how well the live recordings from the show came out.  With a couple added pieces to the band structure along with a couple fly backup singers the music seems to have a flare that some of the studio versions lacked.  Live recordings on cd can be nasty business but the fact of the matter is that some of the live recordings sound more polished than the studio versions.  Another thing that I dug from the performance was the energy.  I felt like I was in an aerobics class watching \\"Life During Wartime\\".  This would be cool to see reinterpreted in 'Guitar Hero'.  Not only are you trying to get the technique down pat but you'll get some exercise to.  David Byrne is awkwardly delightful to watch when performing.  The big suit theatrics fits the titled theme of the show.  I highly recommended this to anyone who wants to know what the hype is around The Talking Heads.
B002GYVRRI|5.0|For my money, and I did buy this, the Fripp-Wetton-Bruford version of King Crimson is far and away the best version of the band. The power and majesty of the sound they created (with Muir and other assorted members and semi-members) carries a rush that no other version has touched, before or since. All of the recordings of this version rank above any of the other recordings by any of the other versions, terrific as some of those are. This threesome melded together and complimented each other and created a mighty sound full of blood, thunder and textures both subtle and crunching. And this is their crowning achievement. Looking back, they almost had to break up - there was nowhere else to go.     Recorded as they were in the process of (amicably) breaking up, there is a sense of pulling out all the stops here. Everything that made them great - the superb musicianship, daring experimentalism and eclectic improvisation is at play here. Wetton's muscular bass (he was never this powerful again) is a particular feast here, and his vocals are also about the best of his career. Bruford's endlessly inventive drumming weaves in and around the others and creates soundscapes of its own. Fripp is at his most frighteningly intense. I'll not duplicate others' track-by-track details, but this is stout and powerful stuff.    The extras are splendid as well and add to, rather than water down the whole.     Its metal, its progressive, its art, its rock and its more than the sum of those parts.
B00004YA66|5.0|***spoilers***    What would you do if you realized you had the means to communicate with the past?  What actions would you change?  Would they be for the better for all?    This story surrounds a fireman father, dead 30 years, now communicating with his adult son via a ham radio.  The son is able to avert his father's fate, but with a terrible twist:  a serial killer's fate is changed too.      A very wonderful film.  My wife and I love this story and have watched it many times.
B00009P1O5|4.0|My favorite Neil has always been loud, fuzzy Neil. Much as I can appreciate his softer, sensitive, folky and country sides, \\"and Crazy Horse\\" is, for me, an automatic. My personal top tier Neil are On the Beach, Ragged Glory, Tonight's the Night, Rust and Time Fades Away. Re-ac-tor is right there in the second tier.    This may be Neil's most irreverent album, though even the goofs have teeth. No one has yet, I don't think, referenced the ample AA imagery rampant in the albums' graphics - the triangle in the circle (not as evident on CD - obvious with the lp and the inner sleeve of same), the lord's prayer on the back cover, etc. Not sure exactly what Neil was going through, but the \\"some things never change, they stay the way they are\\" mood hangs over the album, whether the almost dada \\"T-Bone,\\" the biting cartoon of \\"Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleeze,\\" or the bitter resignation of \\"Southern Pacific.\\"     And the Horse simply hook into a groove and ride it as hard as it will stand. The bottom on this is granite. Their foundation allows Neil the freedom to take off vocally and instrumentally and drive anywhere he wants to. This is a very raw and angry record with Neil barely controlling his playing and singing. As a result, this is a very alive record - a cathartic howl, in many ways as much so as Tonight's the Night, all the more as a result of it being less articulate. Conversely, it is not nearly as dark - less the sound of a man wallowing in the depths as one climbing out, wounds still fresh enough to hurt, but still able to see his own absurd complicity.    And it rocks - ragged and sloppily, it rocks. Couldn't do less, what with Crazy Horse.     Obviously, this is not for everybody - scan the reviews and you will see that a lot of serious Neil fans really hate this record. For me, it's a blast: funny, bitter, angry, loopy and nearly out of control. Loud, fuzzy Neil at his most elemental and off the wall. Think I'll put it on now.

0307477479|5.0|Some years ago, I had an idea for a novel, which I never wrote because, among other reasons, I'm not actually a novelist. But I wanted to tell a story in stories, where a minor character in the first story is the protagonist of the second, and so forth, until, finally, the last story looped back around to the first. (I also had vague plans for this all to be fantasy, but leave that aside for now.) It's not a new idea, of course -- so few worthwhile ideas are -- but it's a shape for a story that hasn't been overused, so it's an appealing, novel shape, both as a would-be writer and as a reader. (Of course, the reason that shape hasn't been used much is because it's fiendishly difficult to write a series of stories like that and actually have them hang together as a novel.)<br /><br />Jennifer Egan won the Pulitzer Prize, just a few weeks ago, for A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD, a novel that bears a very close resemblance to the one I thought I wanted to write. It doesn't charge outward quite as far as I thought I wanted to, staying mostly in the circle of people who know and/or work with record executive Bennie Salazar and his longtime personal assistant Sasha, starting with Sasha in the early '00s, moving on to Bennie only a few years later before ranging widely from the late '70s through much later years. Each of the viewpoint characters only get spotlighted once -- no matter how much the reader wants to get back inside that head, to find out what else happened, to continue that life -- but Egan effortlessly juggles her large cast, keeping each of them razor-distinct and tossing out offhand explanations of the rest of everyone's lives, before or after the events she narrates directly.<br /><br />GOON SQUAD has been called a sweeping novel, which is an odd adjective for a book not even three hundred pages long. But that's absolutely an accurate description -- GOON SQUAD does sweep, across decades and around the world, and is much larger and more capacious than it appears. It's a difficult novel to write about, since each chapter is a separate, precise short story that continues the story of the previous chapter like -- well, not like pearls on a strand, since Egan jumps and obscures much more than that, but perhaps like individual trail markers on a long, winding walk around a particularly impressive piece of scenery. And all of those people, all of those protagonists, come along, dive into your ear and make a home in your brain, and then are gone almost as soon as they came, leaving you to wish they'd return. But they don't; GOON SQUAD is like life in that it leaves you wishing there was so much more of it, and in that people just leave, and you never see them again.<br /><br />Some books have titles that just click -- you're reading along, enjoying the book, having forgotten entirely that you weren't sure what the book's name actually meant, when you stumble over a phrase and stop dead: that's what it means; that's what this book is about; that's what life is. GOON SQUAD is one of those flash-of-lightning books; I won't tell you what the title means, or how it's meaningful, but I will say: it does mean something; it means a hell of a lot. GOON SQUAD is probably not as \\"experimental\\" as it's been described -- for good or bad, whether you seek out or avoid books like that -- even though it does have a single chapter, late in the novel, written in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.<br /><br />There are books that just feel like the real world -- big, complicated, connected in unexpected ways, thrilling and frightening and wonderful -- and A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD is one of the best of those; I'm amazed that anyone could construct it so carefully and so perfectly, and I now need to read more Jennifer Egan.cult novel to write about, since each chapter is a separate, precise short story that continues the story of the previous chapter like -- well, not like pearls on a strand, since Egan jumps and obscures much more than that, but perhaps like individual trail markers on a long, winding walk around a particularly impressive piece of scenery.

B003UESJH4|3.0|I'm sure someone, somewhere, has begun a review of this movie by imitating stuttering in print. \\"I'd like to t-t-t-t-talk ab-b-b-b-b-bout The King's S-s-s-s-speech,\\" perhaps. So, since that slot has already been filled, I don't need to be That Guy, which is a relief. (Because That Guy is a jerk, and not funny, either.)<br /><br />THE KING'S SPEECH is a very high-minded, serious, life-affirming movie, of the kind that the English film industry loves to make -- probably because the American public, and the public of many other countries, including their own, eats it up every time -- and it will be deeply familiar and utterly unsurprising to anyone who has seen more than a dozen movies in his life. (Let along being even vaguely familiar with WWII, or the recent history of the British monarchy.)<br /><br />It's all very nice, full of plummy accents, understated posh surroundings, stiff upper lips, and predictable uplift. Movies like this have been winning piles of Oscar awards for eight or nine decades, and there's no sign that the Academy of 2035 will buck that trend, either. The King's Speech is a movie to make adults feel smart and superior and cultured without having to read subtitles, learn anything substantial, or actually consider any unpleasant things existing in the world, now or ever.<br /><br />Colin Firth plays the younger brother of a bad father whom he nevertheless utterly loves, in the way that only tortured-in-public-school British aristocrats can love their families. (Which is to say: completely undemonstratively.) And he's going to be King as soon as that bad father dies and as soon as his equally-bad-in-other-ways older brother decides to abdicate in favor of marrying an American divorcee. Of course, Firth's Prince Bertie is both utterly devoted to his duty and scared to death of it, which makes him perfect for audience-identification purposes: speaking in public is the #1 fear, so a story about a really rich and powerful guy with that fear (and for a good reason!) is a guaranteed hit.<br /><br />And so on and on; Geoffrey Rush is the obligatory oddball guru, whose unusual methods dependably deliver the results that the stuffed-shirt \\"establishment\\" types can't. And Helena Bonham Carter is given very little to do as the future Queen Mum, but she does it as stiff-upper-lippy as possible. In fact, the story of THE KING'S SPEECH is so tailor-made for a big feel-good movie that one has to wonder why it wasn't made twenty or thirty years ago, probably by Merchant-Ivory. But it did eventually become the movie that was destined to exist, and now destiny won't rest until we all see it.

0425238091|5.0|As an ICU nurse for 4 years, I picked up this book because it came recommended from a colleague. There are many wonderful reviews here on Amazon, so I will just say I second very many. For me, when I first started reading it, made me sick to my stomach. Then, progressed into dark humor about patients I have seen that he describes in this book and that same very feeling they gave me that they gave to him. And lastly, presented me with all the truth and the naked, ugly face of modern adult medicine our average (I mean as it average type, not average care) hospital provides. What the author writes is straight on, blunt, 99% true and not exaggerated, and God, he must have been brave to write this book because I can totally see how easily this book can be criticized and labeled \\"wrong,\\" \\"unethical,\\" \\"not true,\\" etc. The sad and sickening thing is, it's all true and real.
0061726826|5.0|This YA novel is set in an alternative present in Portland, Maine. In this world love has been declared a disease, and a cure is provided to everyone once they turn 18. The government evaluates everyone and sets out the course of their life: what they'll do, where they'll live, even who they'll marry, and how many children they'll have. The book centres on Lena who is just months from her procedure, and is counting down the days. Until she meets Alex and does the unthinkable and falls in love.    I found the book very intriguing and capturing. It reads very easily; I wasn't bogged down in the back story about the way the world and government works. It was all conveyed very seamlessly with the story.    Lena is very likable and relatible. I was surprised at how easily the author was able to capture Lena's thoughts and feelings. Would you know how to describe the feeling of falling in love for the first time? It was very believable and real.    The end is a little predictable, but still heart wrenching. Definitely an amazing read.
6305841861|5.0|Ive been a Bruce fan for more than 20 years, so Ive seen ED2 at least a 100 times, but it never gets old.  If youre into cult type films this is for you. If you only like high dollar epic films by big studios, maybe you should rent before buying.    The first Evil Dead is 'scary'. ED2 seems to be somewhat of a slapstick remake of ED1.   I didnt really like ED1 much at all, but ED2 is off the charts as far as comedy goes.     Five star movie, but thats probably just because Im a fan.
0525422943|5.0|I haven't read If I Stay or, for that matter, anything else by Gayle Forman. This book caught my eye at the bookstore and I was halfway through it before I realized it was promoted as a teen novel. I'm a decade and a half older than its intended audience, but that didn't make me connect any less with the characters, or be any less swept up by the story. Anybody who's loved and lost will identify with the characters, Mia and Adam, who broke up after a horrific accident and reconnect again three years later in Manhattan. I highly recommend this book.

I saw her in concert once, I swear the only part she actually spoke was \\"Hello Houston!\\". What a hack. She barely moved on stage.

B0041KKYBK|3.0|The movie's message is that regulation failed, therefor we need more regulation. IMO this is silly, if a constant refrain. I can't think of a compelling example where regulation ever improved anything, and examples where it caused disaster are legion. And the movie even realizes that the response to the crash has been another bout of poorly structured regulation that will, again, simply make things worse. What makes them think it could ever be possible to get regulation right?    The only argument they make for that is a lack of crashes between Glass Steagal and Reagan, but that's not even true. For example, there was the crash of 1937, which was huge. There was a relative period of calm between 1944 and 1971, but that was because the world was on a Gold standard, that greatly hampered the ability of the Fed to print money. (This goes completely unmentioned.) In other words, the gold standard regulated the regulators and kept them mostly out of mischief. It was entirely predictable, and predicted (for example by Ron Paul), that when Nixon took the world off a Gold standard to allow the Fed to print more money, inflation and crashes would take off, and they did. As Austrians have been remarking for some time now, inflation in the money supply causes crashes. Relatedly, the movie also doesn't adequately address Greenspan and Bernanke's central role in the crash in  inflating the money supply.    Although Inside Game's message is the failure of regulators, it devotes zero footage to pillorying the regulators. Barney Frank is presented in a good light. The payoffs from Mozillo to Dodd et al aren't even mentioned. The fact that Spitzer extorted AIG into dumping Greenberg for no good reason, and that AIG was not involved in risky actions under Greenberg's stewardship and might well never have gotten so involved (Greenberg actually had his own skin in the game, unlike the people who replaced him), is forgotten. The fact that regulators demanded the banks make risky loans in order to vest houses on favored constituencies isn't mentioned. Madoff isn't mentioned. He's tangential to the crisis, but proves the regulators couldn't even perform their most basic functions even with people jumping up and down pointing them to the functions. It mentions that Dodd-Frank act is a disaster in progress, but fails to mention the vast sums Wall Street bestowed on Obama. etc.    It is absolutely correct that the \\"science\\" of economics has been corrupted, but it fails to point out the most central fact about this, namely that Keynesianism was already discredited by the data when Keynes published his book. Hoover had increased Fed spending 50% in response to the crash, resulting in disaster, and by contrast Harding had cut Fed spending 50% in response to the crash of 1920, resulting in a strong economy. Keynsianism was accepted purely because it licensed the politicians to do what they wanted to do, namely spend money, and the politicans have corrupted economics ever since. The evidence on Keynesianism was so bad that in spite of the politicians support for it, academia had finally turned against it, yet in 2008 back it came, as the politicians rewarded any economist who would speak for it, and the economists obliged again.

B001CD6FKI|5.0|I grew up on Speed Racer, and so I was a bit nervous when they announced a big screen live action film, I was a bit nervous. Fortunately, I had nothing to worry about.  The movie is day-glo and splashed with color like a cartoon come to life.  The racing scenes are a great tribute to the old cartoon and its far-flung worldwide races.  Speed's Mach Five and Racer X's Shooting Star are both spot on.    The casting was also dead on in so many cases. John Goodman is a great Pops Racer, right down to the mustache and over-the-top wrestling moves. Matthew Fox nails Racer X, right down to the mysterious voice that was such a big part of the cartoon. Christina Ricci, Susan Sarandon, and Paulie Litt all bring a magic spark that makes this movie a huge hit. The movie stands up just fine as an action adventure in and of itself. But if you're a fan of the classic anime series this big screen blockbuster will thrill you right down to your homing robot !

They updated my phone and it started working great at my house. I went out tonight with just my phone, switched on the exercise trainer and 3G data. It worked great until I got two blocks away from my house and stopped working. I couldn't get it to work again. I called my husband to put my iPod on his car tire so I could have some music to walk to.

B000H0Y0CM|4.0|Red Sonja is the cross between awful and yet a fun, stupid adventure. The acting is horrible, the script could have been written by any semi-literate creature with a writing instrument, the special effects aren't that great but are the better part of the film in SOME parts (see monster water machine thing), and the climactic ending isn't all that climactic. Until you get to the ending-ending, then you can speculate what happens after that smoochin'. But this kind of movie treads that fine line between so bad it'll give you a nose bleed because you realize you spent money on it and yet also so bad it's a hoot. Just don't think a lot, enjoy the fact that Red Sonja makes a severe mullet look manageable and the fact she is rather pretty when she's not trying to act. Or speak. Or do anything outside look off in the distance...<br /><br />A lot of this I believe was done absolutely tongue in cheek. But the sword fighting is neat, the little kid/prince is superbly annoying (which is the point), the fat dude makes for an interesting character, Sonja's hot and so verbally challenged when saying her lines that as a fantasy gal with a broad sword she'd scare you off at \\"Hell-Oh\\". Then there's Arnold who is, well, Arnold - poster child for broadswords and upper arms that make women (who aren't slightly grossed out by muscle bound guys) coo. Every geek (including me) loves Arnold. A lot. So we buy this flick. And if we're also in the real world, we just sit back and laugh until you start crying (literally, it's that bad).<br /><br />The one thing that gets me is her bizarrely weak nemesis. I am thoroughly convinced this is just evidence bad barbarian breakups make fr a whole lot of seriously expressed anger issues. Like the whole, \\"Oh, I'll have your family murdered, burn your house down with you in it after you're totally abused by my soldiers and we'll fight to the death at the end of all this when I find out you survived said fire! RAR!\\". Totally screams bad lady-lady breakup so just get prepared for the cat-fighting. And the fact that Arnold makes himself useful because he's in love with Sonja, not because he's really there to destroy this nameless world making/destroy/a glowing-spiked-ball-thin like he says he is. But that's to be expected.<br /><br />My final warning is that you might get this feeling throughout the film that if you were caught watching this it might seem worse than other things you could be doing on the internet. YES, it's that bad.<br /><br />And, for reasons unknown, there's some fun in spending an hour and a half laughing at this (if you're in the right mindset).<br /><br />Don't take it too seriously; just eat popcorn with friends and get ready to cackle!so just get prepared for the cat-fighting.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|John Mayer is making mature music these days, which is to say that \\"Battle Studies\\" is an adult album that plays it easy. Having jumped off the hot-shot guitarist train, he now sounds more like the Eric Clapton of \\"Unplugged\\" than the EC of \\"Slowhand.\\" Or more to the point, Mayer now sounds like he's intent on being the new Phil Collins.<br /><br />Not that being Collins is a bad thing, as Phil's best work in the 80's still sounds terrific. The lead track, \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" is almost the kind of divorce song Collins specialized in for his first two solo albums, minus the landmine sounding drums. Having Taylor Swift on \\"Half Of My Heart\\" is the equivalent of Collin's duets like \\"Separate Lives.\\" The finale, \\"Friends, Lovers or Nothing,\\" is one of the songs that merits the Clapton comparisons, and that's in a good way. Although Mayer brings these comparisons on himself by pulling readily identifiable covers out of the box, like the way he funkifies \\"Crossroads.\\" While the song belongs to Robert Johnson, its most recognizable version was EC's (who even had a box set under that title, fer crying out loud).<br /><br />Mayer made himself into his own performer with the albums \\"Try\\" and \\"Continuum,\\" which makes \\"Battle Studies\\" a slight step back. \\"Assassin\\" is the most individualistic song here, delivered with guitar firepower and subdued voice, and is the one song that sounds like it came in from the \\"Continuum\\" sessions. \\"All We Ever Do is Say Goodbye\\" is a terrific radio record, but someone should have told Mayer that \\"Who Says\\" is the kind of novelty that wears out quickly. He's long past the point in his career where trifles like that should be on solid albums; if Mayer wants to keep holding himself to the standards of Clapton, BB King and other guitar greats he claims he wants to emulate, he needs to study their battles more in depth.<br /><br />\\"Battle Studies\\" is a sturdy album, ultimately. It sounds like a sharp left from the the more intense previous album, with Mayer aiming for adult-pop without getting mired in the saccharine. He still needs to concentrate on being John Mayer as opposed to a composite of his heroes. While he loves to rub shoulders with the greats and does so with much skill, he will ultimately need to decide if he wants to rub against the great ones or stand alongside of them as an equally talented artist.ult-pop without getting mired in the saccharine.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Let me add my voice to those of the many readers who loved this book. I can't wait to dive into the sequel.<br /><br />Rothfuss' drama has an epic feel to it. After a slow beginning in which we meet our hero living an anonymous life as an innkeeper, we plunge into the autobiography of Kvothe. We learn he was an usually talented child of traveling players whose parents are brutally murdered by mysterious supernatural forces guarding a sinister secret.<br /><br />Rothfuss creates a world that is pretty similar but a bit different from our own in a vaguely medieval time. Locomotion is on horseback or on foot; technology is enhanced by alchemy or strange powers which a chosen few can master through years of practice at a university if they have the talent. We learn little of the political structure of this world, but we do discover a bit about its mythic history.<br /><br />At its heart, this is an old-fashioned adventure story as well as being a truly epic love story. I am comforted by the thought that at the end of this hefty volume, we are still at the early stages of the tale and many more pages of pleasurable reading lie ahead.<br /><br />We have learned about the child Kvothe's tenuous survival as a barefooted waif, begging and stealing in the big city. At age 15, he talks his way into the university where he aims to uncover the secret behind his parents' gruesome deaths. He makes friends and deadly enemies, falls in love, fights a dragon and has numerous other adventures.<br /><br />Rothfuss' narrative drive carries us along. I found this book totally absorbing. It's not perhaps great literature but it is undoubtedly great entertainment.

I was rather disappointed when I realized it was never coming and this was a book about Darcy. Through reading the first book I had grown to empathize with and understand Rachel and I even got frustrated with Darcy. I looked forward to hearing more about Rachel's life in the second book.  \\"Something Blue\\" was not what I had anticipated at all. I kept reading thinking it would become something better - it never did. Even at the end of the book I was expecting more and unfortunately I feel like it never came. The second book just isn't as satisfactory as the first and left me feeling \\"something [akin to] blue\\".

I'm just here to tell you that this stuff is IT. I could go without the sometime hokey \\"rotating piano\\" schtick (why oh WHY was this done? does it really serve ANY purpose?), but the music is just perfectly paced, and Billy's piano and voice is SURPRISINGLY seasoned and warm, despite the environs of the outdoor stadium. That said, this whole mix is superb...there's not many times a live show OUTDOORS in a large arena can be made to sound intimate and LOOK intimate, yet the directors and engineers manage it with LOTS and LOTS of close ups, not just of BJ, but of all the performers (try not to mesmerized by the percussionist/backup singer/alto saxophonist to just stage left and behind BJ...wow!) are highlighted and the thing is an amazing whole picked from the best of the shows done in that amazing set of concerts at Shea (goodbye, old friend...).<br /><br />Don't snub this, like I almost did. It's an amazing, beautifully wonderful performance and production.

B003O85W3A|5.0|The Suburbs is a very good record. It takes me back to my own childhood growing up in the suburbs, and I think Arcade Fire is spot-on when they describe the effect this kind of life has on us. That was me riding the bus, feeling lost and wondering where, exactly, did I belong amidst the cement sprawl and dead shopping malls. \\"Where do you kids live?\\" We didn't really see it at the time, but we were all trying to figure that out. We settle for such mediocrity in the moments of our lives, stuck in traffic, staring at mile after mile of sprawl, losing vitality and purpose. These songs are the band's own artistic expression of that anger and sadness, and they are  worth hearing. Arcade Fire writes good songs, and they have something to say.

B000026CZJ|5.0|The changing seasons deserve better than to be represented musically in just four tableaux, surely? Tchaikovsky did not set out to put this matter right, but luckily for us he accepted a commission from a musical monthly publication to contribute a new piano piece for amateur performers in twelve successive issues, each piece having a vague specific relevance to each month in question. He arranged for a monthly reminder, and when it was served he sat down and knocked out the pieces at a single sitting each. Not exactly carried along on a hurricane of irresistible divine afflatus, I suppose, but so what? Tchaikovsky was Tchaikovsky, and he could tap into the divine jetstream as he pleased. The pieces are something between Schubert's Moments Musicaux and Grieg's Lyric Pieces. They are not etudes or Songs Without Words, they are neither beginners' works nor virtuoso stuff, and they show respect for their intended public without being patronising. The other five pieces making up this recital are incidental by-products of his musical and orchestral workshop, unless we should make an exception for the Aveu Passionne, which turns out to be an arrangement of a sequence from the 'symphonic ballad' Voyevoda, itself in turn something left over from an opera project manqu&eacute;.<br /><br />This is Ashkenazy the pianist in 1999, and it turns out that he too had a commission to fulfil, playing for the soundtrack of a cinema version of Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard. By that time Ashkenazy had meandered, like some other eminent solo musicians, down a hopeful sunset path as a conductor, and it is a special pleasure to welcome him back to the task nature intended him for.<br /><br />If you are sampling this disc do not, if I may suggest, make the mistake that I made at first hearing. My first reaction was to think the sound over-resonant, and the reason I thought so was that I was subconsciously listening out for Ashkenazy the super-virtuoso. These are not virtuoso works, and Ashkenazy has more sense and more good taste than to play them as if they were. This is how they should have sounded from the more adept of their original performers, and the more I got on to the player's new wavelength the more touching and affecting I started to find the performances. The sound that I first found to be too resonant has come to seem to me rich and comforting, and that was never the kind of sound that I looked for from Ashkenazy in the old days. The recording has a lot to do with this as well, obviously, and presumably they all worked out the effect by consultation among themselves, unless it just turned out right by happenstance.<br /><br />The other reason for my 5-star rating is simply the choice of the music here. I don't think we hear Tchaikovsky's solo piano material much, no doubt because it is not the stuff of recitals at the Carnegie Hall or the Barbican or those sorts of places. My collection already contains the 18 late pieces that he wrote `for the money' played by Pletnev, and the piano sonata, which has anything that can be done for it done for it by Richter. Neglected piano music does not often come up to this sort of quality, and I am grateful to all concerned for this particular enterprise.<br /><br />There is quite a good liner note by Tim Parry, mainly about the music as it should be but making reference to the 1962 Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow, in which Ashkenazy shared the first prize with our late and much lamented John Ogdon. What had happened was that this prize had always gone to Russians until the previous occasion when there had been no option but to give it to Van Cliburn. Now it was obviously having to go to Ogdon, and in the sulphurous bathybunkers of Soviet committeedom it was seen as necessary to yank a reluctant Ashkenazy out on to the platform to save Soviet face by sharing the award. He duly shared it, and for all I ever knew maybe he deserved to. Where are they now, I wondered in the afterglow of the Soviet Union<br /><br />Come we where Chekhov and Tchaikovsky are,<br />And good John Ogdon, we are dust and dreams.<br />[apologies to Housman]<br /><br />I think I recommend this disc more for its sense of being a rite of passage, a sense of crossing the bar, than for anything else. The other names are long gone, but Vladimir Ashkenazy still bestrides the generations, and the music will do that far more so, as long as we take the trouble to get to know it.chaikovsky are,  And good John Ogdon, we are dust and dreams.

It's almost as if the publisher really doesn't want to sell a Kindle edition but if it must, then its going to charge an outrageous price for the privilege.

Fortunately Amazon gives us an opportunity to respond to the insult by allowing us to influence the rating for this product, and pricing is just as much a factor in that rating as the content of the book.

1592402038|4.0|Lynne Truss is a self-proclaimed Stickler, which means, according to her, she is an \\"unattractive know-all obsessive who gets things out of proportion.\\"   She gets all worked up seeing signs like:  \\"CHILDREN DRIVE SLOWLY\\" or \\"CHILDREN, DRIVE SLOWLY.\\"  I mean, she is right! Hey, I am all nervous about my punctuation now.  WHERE SHOULD I PUT THE PERIOD IN THAT SENTENCE?    You will learn about the Apostrophe Protection Society (APS) whose members write nice letters to tell people how to use the apostrophe correctly.  I had to go to their website to assure myself that Truss is not joking.  Those do-gooder, they are real, YOU GUY!            The book is funny and (repetitively) informative.  Sometimes she does go over to the dark side and is really mean.  I do really feel sorry for her childhood pen-pal.      Of course, her writing is very heavily punctuation-filled.  She can go forever without using the period.  Observe and learn.             \\"Cruelty to punctuation is quite unlegislated: you can get away with pulling the legs off semicolons; shrivelling question marks on the garden path under a powerful magnifying glass; you name it.\\"      \\"We refuse to patronise any shop with checkouts for \\"eight items or less\\" (because it should be \\"fewer\\"), and we got very worked up after 9/11 not because of Osama bin-Laden but because people on the radio kept saying \\"enormity\\" when they meant \\"magnitude\\", and we really hate that.\\"      A little much?  Truss shows us Virginia Woolf:      \\"As for the other experiences, the solitary ones, which people go through alone, in their bedrooms, in their offices, walking the fields and the streets of London, he had them; had left home, a mere boy, because of his mother; she lied; because he came down to tea for the fiftieth time with his hands unwashed; because he could see no future for a poet in Stroud; and so, making a confidant of his little sister, had gone to London leaving an absurd note behind him, such as great men have written, andthe world has read later when the story of their struggles has become famous.\\"    One lone period, you guys!  I am amazed, and scared-y.
B0041KKYDI|1.0|After reading Aron Ralston's book Between a Rock and a Hard Place, I wanted to see the film that it inspired.  I'm soooo glad I read the book first, or I may not have bothered to read the book.  Sadly the film version is vastly inferior to the book.  Unfortunately the producers chose to cobble together a slap-dash version that utterly fails to capture the story and character of Aron Ralston and his family, the events that lead up to his harrowing experience in Blue John Canyon, and the significance of that experience for Ralston and for us.  This could have been and should have been an exceptional film, but it is just a \\"C\\" grade flick that is destined to be just a flash in the cinematic frying pan. Don't waste your time or money, read the book--I highly recommend it.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Very interesting movie.  In spite of several misrepresentations, it was good, even humorous, to see the many distortions from the Sagas.  First was the loss of Odin's eye.  That was not a war wound, but a freely given sacrifice to gain insight and wisdom.  When you see Odin in the movie, he lacks his constant companions, the two great wolves, Geri and Freki, and his ravens, Huginn and Muninn.     Thor is red haired, not blond. In the movie, he rides to the Byfrost gate on a horse, not in his chariot, driven by two great goats.  Most may fail to find the humor in Thor's request at the pet store for a dog or cat big enough to ride, but such creatures are very present in Norse legends. It would have been a very reasonable request for him.  It was one of the best parts of the show, if you know the background.     In the film, Sif seems to fully understand Thor's love for a human woman. Sif is Thor's wife!  Could a even a goddess show such \\"understanding\\"?   Thor will never be the \\"King\\". He, and his father, are doomed to fall together in the final battle, Ragnarok, to save the universe.     All in all, a great entertainment movie, but it has many \\"glitches\\".      This is obviously a \\"comic book\\" rendition.  In the future, someone may have the backing, and backbone, to tell the ssgas correctly.     The great power of the Norse Religion, is the fact that of all the gods humans have ever worshiped, only the Æsir and their kin the Vanir, have to face the prospect of failure and death.  Because they have to face the same failures and weakenesses we humans do, of all faiths, our gods respect courage, devotion, and honor more than others.

B002XTBEDI|4.0|The first Cranford is a favorite in our home:  it has well drawn characters in deep and subtle situations that are fraught with emotion, with historical change, with personal development and hope.  It is one of the most beautiful mini-series I have ever seen, yet never gets precious or maudlin.  SO it was only a matter of time before we got this one.<br /><br />On the one hand, there are many  strengths to this production.  The characters develop, some in very surprising yet believable ways, including tragedies, changes in plans, and unexpected love.  This is very fun and makes it much more than a simple follow-on.  The period atmosphere is also elegant and plush, vividly and accurately evoking a period in history - my kids had many questions about it.  On the other hand, the story feels rushed.  Not only is there too much going on too fast, but the viewer lacks the time to integrate it all.  That translates into a kind of overload and a complete lack of the meditative, almost poetic, pauses and asides that makes the first production a meal to savor.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, the train remains a controversial issue, with many complications and the need for continuing negotiations with owners and changes of attitude.  (This was one reason why train networks spread in the US much more swiftly.)  The son of the reigning aristocrat also returns too late, though after some brutal machinations he is whisked away all too quickly.  The wonderful boy who is charged with getting an education in order to create a school for the town also faces a significant and unexpected crisis.  Nonetheless, while most of the principal characters are there, the doctor no longer serves the town.  His loss is partially made up with a group of very good new characters, but again, it feels rushed.  One very interesting character is a Scottish aristocrat, who arrives in town to visit a relative - sparking a major fight - and astounds everyone with her decision to stay.  That is all I can say without giving away too much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to fans of the first series.  It is very good, if not as perfectly outstanding as we had hoped.t giving away too much.    I would recommend this to fans of the first series.

B004NO03E2|5.0|Colorado, the place that gave us John Denver (gag) and all that mountain wholesomeness back in the mid '70's, apparently decided to apologize to the music world for having forced Country Boy on us a few decades back, truly a black time in pop music history if there ever was one.  Denver, the city, not the twerp singer, has given us Cephalic Carnage, as twisted an outfit as you can get, and also is the home to Havok, one of thrash metal's great young acts.  On \\"Time Is Up\\", their second album, these young buckaroos have raised the bar for thrash excellence pretty damn high.<br />  Yes, thrash is in somewhat of a retro phase right now, but in the face of all this faceless screaming over a barrage of noise that usually can't get it together enough to resemble a hook, it's only natural that metal fans who demand some musicality turn to thrash or death metal for chops.  Havok is a real barnburner, good company to Evile, probably the other great thrash band that will bust wide open with their third album which should be out pretty soon, we hope.<br />  What makes Havok stand out is outstanding guitar hooks and real melodies, although at a breakneck pace.  The energy here is enough to light up a good sized city, if you could plug it in.  The leads sear, vocals are raspy but understandable, and the drums and bass propel the album along at supersonic speed without sacrificing the truly outstanding playing.  It's all good, no bum cuts anywhere.  Were I in a veteran thrash band, this is one outfit I'd think twice about before letting them open for me.  Exodus, Kreator and Sodom fans need to get on this bandwagon.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I use the H4N mostly for video production, it performs flawlessly every time I use it.  It is solid and well built, simple to use, yet powerful.  Probably it's best points are it's ability two record 4 channels simultaneously (all from external sources with an additional preamp), and the amazing mics built on the device.  The only bad thing I can find to say about it is after a year of very heavy use, I have done all of the field capture for an entire full length movie and dozens of other smaller projects the icons on the 4 main buttons are starting to where off.  But after as much use as I have put this thing through i don't think I could forget what the buttons do what if I tried.  All things said probably the best recorder of it's kind at any price.

B0026JWDQW|5.0|As much as Paolo Nutini's first album tugs at your heartstrings, this multi-genre gem is somehow nostalgic and current simultaneously, and will get you moving.  You don't have to be an oldster to enjoy his throwbacks to jazz, jive, Motown, reggae,country, or his just plain good music.  His voice moves from joyful, contemplative, and near Cat Stevens, to frolicking and joking. I like each track more and more with each listen.  Nutini is a wonderful singer/songwriter with rich lyrics who isn't afraid to express himself using any kind of musical form.  He's hard to categorize, which is just as well, because his songwriting and singing abilities transcend compartmentalizing and just allow us to enjoy every minute of this disc.

B0007Y08PQ|4.0|I've stated elsewhere that Insurrection ranks as one of the best of the series. I would like to restate this stance a bit.Frankly, this is the kind of story Star Trek has always been best at, which is one of the reasons I think this one is possibly the best of the series when you look at it as a Star Trek story. As a movie, well, it's okay. Not exactly monumental, but then again, how many of us have been clamoring for them to get back to the lower key stories and lay off the attempted megasuperbombastic blockbusters because they just didn't measure up?<br /><br />As a Star Trek story, it hits the mark quite well. This is precisely the type of story that Star Trek was meant to tell, an analogy to events right here on Earth. Where it falls short is as a movie, a stand-alone film, and too much of the success of the storyline depends on the audience knowing depends on the audience knowing something about the Star Trek mythos, specifically the TNG end of things. The TOS movies had an advantage in that category in that enough of the general public knows who Kirk, Spock, etc., Bottom line: As another installment of the TNG storyline, it succeeds. It fails in that the story itself isn't exactly an event (it could very well have been told during the regular run of the series, possibly within a single hour), and with that constantly in the background (in a movie theatre, it's tough to ignore), it's just hard to get excited about this one, hence the feeling of being let down. Personally, I'm starting to lean towards bringing the Enterprise back to television, probably with Riker in command. With the myriad television series, the need for a movie series just isn't there anymore.<br /><br />Eventually, this film will most likely take its place among the best of the movies, and certainly the best of the TNG movies, but so long as the spectre of the poor box office return looms over this film, it will continue to be counted among the turkeys.
1603580557|5.0|If there is one thing that the reader will gather from reading this eloquent and engaging study, it is that there are no easy ways to fix problems. Systems are complex things, and pushing one button here may produce the intended outcome, but it might very well produce a side effect that is worse than the original condition.<br /><br />This idea is best described by the author, as she says, \\"it is almost irresistible to blame something or someone else, to shift responsibility away from ourselves, and to look for the control knob, the product, the pill, the technical fix that will make a problem go away.\\" But doing one thing will require a shift in resources or an overflow of stock that might end up hurting more than it helps.<br /><br />Thinking in Systems uses this central idea to show the difficulties in solving our political and economic problems. With such a lucid, objective framework, it is only logical that the author takes an objective view of the subject matter. For the most part, she does not blame everything on one party or the other and seems rather even-handed in her criticism of both major parties.<br /><br />The book is most convincing in the realm of ecology, especially with regard to growth, which she rightly points out is a faulty goal in itself, and should be reconsidered from a systems perspective (i.e., with all the consequences in view).<br /><br />The libertarian might object to her conclusion that at least some major government intervention is necessary in order to prevent inefficiency and widespread hardship. As she puts it, \\"Some systems really need an intervenor!\\" When she implies that Ronald Reagan's anti-government stance was a reaction to corporate power, her biases are revealed. Hers is a line of thought that says that anyone who goes against government must be in collusion with corporations, and that anyone in collusion with corporations must be against the environment, personal freedom, etc.<br /><br />But the author even said that there are traps involved with government intervention. It is to forget that the government is the biggest corporation out there, and that system changes made by it can have more devastating side effects than anything done in the private sector.<br /><br />Ultimately, these biases don't injure the excellent treatment the author offers on the subject matter as a whole. And, as a result, this book comes highly recommended for anyone interested in systems, economics, or politics.tervention.

B003N3DU1W|5.0|`Departures' is a beautiful Japanese film that left me surprised by it's depth and poignancy.  This follows a young cellist, called Daigo Koboyashi, whose Orchestra is disbanded and so he returns with his wife to his home town to earn a living.  He takes a job as an encoffiner (someone who puts the deceased into their coffin) and learns the trade from an experienced older mentor.  He is shunned by some parts of society due to the taboo nature of his job, but he gains the respect of others when they see the level of dignity and honour with which he handles the deceased.  There is more to this film, but I won't spoil your enjoyment by divulging it here.<br /><br />This film has a wonderful score and the direction is among the best I have seen from a Japanese film of this type.  This film is beautifully framed and it has some amazing scenes showing the ceremony where they prepare the various deceased people.  The story kept me engrossed throughout and despite it's gentle feel, it also has a degree of gravitas and emotion simmering beneath the surface the whole way through.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did and despite being a fan of Japanese cinema, even I was surprised at how well constructed, acted and directed this was. This is a moving and heart warming drama and if you are a fan of world cinema, or just wish to see an excellent film in it's own right, then this comes highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00006G8HX|4.0|In a Phil Foglio comic strip, he shows two characters debating how Spock will be brought back, with one of the characters declaring that since Leonard Nimoy directing the next film, then Spock's resurrection will assuredly be done in a tasteful, thoughful manner. The last frame shows Nimoy flipping the script for ST III, saying to the offscreen producer, \\"I particularly like the part where I rise again on the third day.\\"<br /><br />Thankfully, the final result actually did come in more dignified than that. In this one, Nimoy gets to show just how much he knows Star Trek, and flex his directorial muscles. In short, Leonard Nimoy knows Star Trek, probably better than Gene Roddenberry ever did. The characterizations are dead-on perfect, the right amount of humor is present, and the plot never, ever drags. The only problem with this movie is the fact that it's only 90 minutes long, and with a movie as tightly paced as this one, that's short. However, anything else would be seen as padding, so, in the end, it's better to have a really good 90 minute film than a two hour film that's been padded out. Bottom line: It's Star Trek, it's a great movie, and it definitely leaves you wanting more (kind of like having a big meal, then having dessert cancelled).
1594202710|5.0|Unlike excellent histories that focus on broad theoretical origins of politico-economic systems such as Fukuyama's [[ASIN:0374227349 Origins]], this book focuses on the modern manifestations and practical lessons of the Asian giant that could only be witnessed first hand by someone with intimate connections to the leaders. Kissinger proves throughout this erudite book that only someone with his experience and diplomatic savvy could have possibly gotten close enough to understand the culture. It just so happens that he is the only one that has such experience and savvy.<br /><br />Of course, this book does offer a grand history of the culture, from its beginnings nearly 5,000 years ago, and it is a brilliant survey.  It shines most, however, in the 20th century, when Kissinger's personal account is employed to convey the rest of the story.<br /><br />Anyone looking for insight into the rationale for China's isolationism and that of the United States, which wanted badly to open the door, will be enthralled by this account. We learn, as seems obvious in retrospect, that it was not much more than the shrewdest of pragmatic policy decisions in an age when shrewd policy was the only way to survive. Kennedy and Johnson had both tried and failed. With the help of Kissinger, who has a reputation for shrewd pragmatism, Nixon finally succeeded.<br /><br />Kissinger reflects on the sleeping dragon at perhaps a more interesting time than the 1970s, when he was secretary of state. After 40 years, Nixon and his measures seem vindicated, as China has steadily moved in the direction of freedom and capitalism. And yet, with human rights issues far from being resolved and growing economic friction between China and the U.S., the fate of the relationship is more precarious than ever.<br /><br />That is why this is such an important book. It is our good fortune that Mr. Kissinger has been able to produce it.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|After hearing for a long time from my girlfriend that she loved this show, I was very happy to find this box set.  I'd kept my eyes open for Dr. Quinn seasons, but I never saw them anywhere.  When I saw that this had all the seasons plus two movies and tons of special features, I had to get it.  It turned out better than expected.  She has absolutely loved watching all of these episodes again, and she and her mom have traded them back and forth for months now.  This set is so well put-together and has so many hours of material that it's an incredible deal.  I haven't heard a single complaint; great picture, sound, DVD menus, DVD cases and box.  The creators of this set have done quite a favor for fans of Dr. Quinn, so if you're looking for a perfect gift for someone who likes the show, don't hesitate to get it.
B000TGJ80I|4.0|Six years before \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" fully revealed the origins of a war between vampires and lycans, we were flung head-long into the fray with 2003's surprise hit \\"Underworld\\".    \\"Underworld\\" follows Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire who is a member of an elite group of lycan hunters known as \\"Death Dealers\\". As the centuries-old blood feud between the two races rages on, Selene and her fellow vampires believe that the lycans' days are numbered. However, when an unsuspecting human (Scott Speedman) becomes the focal point of the conflict; everything Selene believes about the war, her heritage, and her mission may change forever.    Upon its release \\"Underworld\\" presented audiences with a new take on vampires and lycans (typically known as werewolves). Long gone are the days of Bela Lugosi's undeniably iconic \\"Dracula\\" or Lon Chaney, Jr's \\"The Wolf Man\\". Now, we are presented with vampires decked out in sleek, leather outfits, packing modern-day weaponry and martial arts influenced fighting styles. Plus, lycans that have never looked as menacing or believable as they do in this film.    Not to mention, the lycans' transformations (a nearly seamless blend of CGI and practical effects) are some of the best committed to film to this day. One thing is for sure, these are supernatural beings and monsters for the new, post-\\"Matrix\\" generation of moviegoers.    Written by Danny McBride (\\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycan\\") the film wastes little time jumping into both the main crux of the story (i.e. the specifics of the two races, the war, and so on) and the fast-paced, hard-hitting action sequences. For the most part the story does a terrific job in balancing the plot with the action, interspersed with brief tidbits of the history between the two races. However, at times the plot feels a little too rushed in order to keep the momentum going, resulting in some uneven, almost jumbled aspects to the story.    That being said, in the end those moments are overshadowed by the fact that Danny McBride did an excellent job of crafting a story that introduced us to a complicated war between supernatural beings. While the director, Len Wiseman (\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\") skillfully guided the story to cinematic life complete with style, an eerie atmosphere that blended the familiar with the supernatural, and a terrifically cast group of actors and actresses.    Speaking of the cast, let's begin with actress Kate Beckinsale (\\"Pearl Harbor\\") as the leather-clad vampire Selene. Kate's performance was generally stoic and emotionless, which makes sense given she is portraying a member of the so-called undead. However, there were some brief glimpses of newfound emotions boiling to the surface and Kate's handling of Selene's bewilderment to the aforementioned was completely natural and effortless.    Also, seeing a female vampire doing a majority of the action was an interesting change of pace for this type of film, but a welcome one at that. Kate handled herself in the action sequences in such a strong, confident manner that she quickly solidified her character as one not to be messed with.    Actor Scott Speedman (\\"Dark Blue\\") was good in the role of Michael, the human that the lycans are focused upon. However, I did find that occasionally his acting felt a little forced. Perhaps he was over-rehearsed so that the scenes couldn't flow naturally for him. Even so, acting wise I don't believe he is up to par with some of the other, more accomplished cast members.    Of course, the fact that a vampire/werewolf movie actually has acting that was good enough to set standards for the entire cast is surprising in itself (at least in my estimation). That alone should indicate that this film is not just another one of your typical, run-of-the-mill monster films where the acting is the last thing on anyone's mind. This film's cast actually seemed to take pride in getting their characters right and making them interesting to the audience, while still holding true to the archetypes being portrayed.    Speaking of those cast members that set the aforementioned acting bar; aside from Kate Beckinsale, we have the two talented actors chosen to play the respective leaders of the two races, actors Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen.    As the vampire king, Viktor, veteran actor Bill Nighy (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\\") commands both respect and fear with his portrayal that was at times endearing, but could then be utterly cold, calculating and undeniably evil. His layered performance elevated the character of Viktor from being just another one-dimensional despot to a complicated being that was very real despite his supernatural disposition.    The ever-reliable actor Michael Sheen (\\"Frost/Nixon\\") as Lucian, leader of the lycans, brought a quiet strength to the role that belied the ferocity lurking just beneath the surface. His performance was laced with such subtle malevolence, so that whenever his character would snap and unleash the inner beast it was almost startling; despite the fact you knew it had to happen at some point.    With such generally strong performances, fast-paced action and stunts, and solid storytelling, \\"Underworld\\" is without a doubt an excellent monster movie in every sense. The film successfully brings a centuries-old war between supernatural beings to life in a way that is interesting and above all, entertaining.    \\"Underworld\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00406UK7S|2.0|Neil made one of my all time favorite films, The Descent. Centurion was a complete disappointment. Lackluster acting and story. Some pretty good action, but ruined by the very \\"video looking\\" quality and the lack of giving a damn about any of these characters!
B000083C49|4.0|ST IV is a Star Trek story in the classic tradition. Earth, and therefore the Federation, are in dire peril, only the Enterprise crew can save the day (and this time, it's not because they're the only ship in the quadrant; actually, because they're the only ship that wasn't in the area and didn't get itself whacked!), and we have a nice social commentary thrown in for good measure (as a result of the high profile of ST IV, especially internationally, whale hunting has finally been revealed as the butchery that it is, and whaling as an industry is finally on its way out).<br /><br />The story is well-paced, characterizations are letter perfect, and there's just enough special effects to get the point across, but the story doesn't depend on them. As Star Trek, it's a resounding success. As a movie, well, the big box office take speaks for itself.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I did not know what to expect after my initial exposure to this group was the tail end of a live performance clip on youtube.  My wife had heard and fell in love with Little Lion Man, and wanted me to buy just the single, so I just bucked up and bought the album on sale here on Amazon.  I have to say for once I was ashamed of my anti-mainstream attitude.  The accolades and award nominations are deserved.  I typically see the genre of this group as folk, and I am having a hard time pegging them on that aside from their instrumentation.  This group seems to ride this fine line between traditional, folk, and alternative that is at times both intimate and powerful.  The sad thing is that they have enough radio hook to make them sing-able and dammit, is just plain good music.      It seems they have an interesting formula on the majority of songs here that start simple with vocal and a single instrument, and then gradually build in intensity and complexity with clever instrumentation and vocals that is really engaging.  They hook you into the song with simplistic verse, get you listening and waiting, and then bam... they hit you with massive chorus and bridge.  While this song structure is consistent throughout the album, it does not feel forced.  Banjo, fiddle and dobro are prevalent and likely enhance that earthy sound that I think resonates with its rapidly growing fan base.     I feel kind of bad for caving into top 40, but whether you pay $5 dollars or $20 for this album, it is worth every single penny.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I found this to be a true and beautiful depiction of Miss Austen's novel - the few minor deviations did not take away from the story at all. Andrew Davies' screenplay adaptation was wonderful. Felicity Jones is an excellent Catherine Morland, and played the character with all the innocence and guileless imagination one pictures in the novel. JJ Field plays the soul-meltingly romantic figure of Henry Tilney with a gentility and humor that delights the viewer every moment. I love the romance of this film, and the spooky undertones of Miss Morland's imagined dramas and her impulsive quest to unearth wicked secrets. Altogether money and an evening well spent.
0802798225|5.0|I had been hearing so much hype about this book and I decided to check out what everyone was raving about. Now I completely understand and I can start raving too!<br /><br />Brittany is queen of the school. She is perfect in every way, the perfect boyfriend, the perfect hair, clothes and car. She lives on the north side of town in her perfect house with her perfect family. Alex is in a gang. He is mexican and lives on the south side of town where the gangbangers live and the poor.<br /><br />The book starts off on the first day of their senior year. Brittany cannot wait to see her boyfriend after the long summer that he spent away and Alex is just hoping he can keep himself out of trouble. A chance meeting in the parking lot starts a whole whirlwind of events, but the kicker is that Brittany's chem partner has turned out to be Alex and they hate each other!<br /><br />I really, really enjoyed this book and now understand why everyone else did as well. I enjoyed reading about all the drama unfolding between Alex and Brittany. I loved the alternating points of view! This is a great book for a high school student. It teaches that no matter where you come from or how you look on the outside, you should never judge a book by it's cover. You may find out that you and your enemy are more alike than you think!
B00005JKHP|4.0|When you take out all the side issues associated with this film (the constant rewrites, the last-minute changes in effects houses, the \\"it's a tv show, now it's a movie\\" waffling, the fact that this was the first new live-action Star Trek in ten years, etc..), and just look at the film itself, what you're left with is a movie that is probably closer to the feel of the original Star Trek than almost any of the following films. Considering that the plotline is derivative of more than a few original series episodes, most noticeably \\"The Changeling\\", \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\", and \\"The Doomsday Machine\\", this really shouldn't be much of a surprise. Still, the plotline, and its resolution, are classic Star Trek.<br /><br />The problems lie mainly in the area of execution, especially with regards to pacing, the amount of time devoted to special effects, and the overly somber mood throughout this film (I don't count characterization since Kirk and Spock not quite being themselves is integral to the plot). After screening the first pilot, William Shatner mentioned to Gene Roddenberry that the characters were taking themselves far too seriously, instead of just doing their jobs like people normally do their jobs, with a bit of a sense of humor. In this film, that piece of advice is, for the most part, ignored. With Gene Roddenberry trying to show just how much in control he was, Star Trek was returned back to the mood of \\"The Cage\\" (\\"We're in space, and this is serious, serious stuff, kids! Ooooooh, aren't we so important that we're in space doing this important work! Can't you just feel the tension?\\").<br /><br />The bottom line: It's definitely Star Trek. In fact, it's pretty good Star Trek (not great, but pretty good, especially the Director's Edition with all those crucial character development scenes put back in!), but as a movie, it's a little slow in places, puts too much emphasis on special effects over plot and character development, and really needed a bit more color in those sets and costumes.s and costumes.

B004NJW96C|5.0|I just want to say, if you are a real fan of moby and not just waiting for him to put out another \\"Play\\" album, then you are in for a treat with this one.  I can't for the life of me figure out why all the critics are bashing this one and saying it's boring.  What I personally love most about moby is how so many of his songs are able to hit my emotional core like no other artist.  This is like an entire album of those types of songs and they all flow together perfectly, I love it.  He's not trying to entertain you or help you pass the time here, there is real human emotion put into this.  No it won't make you want to hit the dance floor, but it could easily stir up thoughts you didn't realize were buried so deep.  So please ignore all the critics on this one. Just Turn it on, sit back, listen and reflect upon life and all the beauty that it can provide.
B00005JOA0|3.0|For the first time I am writing a review on a novel-based film about which I have not read the book. I feel as though if I had, there would have been much more understood about the storyline and the dramatic and intense moments that I completely missed out on. I give this movie three stars because of that - it was an interesting story, well-acted, and well put together, but left enough out for me to be a little confused at the end.    The story is very dark and mysterious, centering around a widow and her young son who take up residency in Wildfell Hall. The lady is unknown to the townsfolk and once invited into company acts very coldly and is therefore perceived to be unfriendly and rude. She is very protective of her son and apparently just wants to be left to herself.    Unfortunately this is a draw to a young man in the village, who befriends and falls in love with her. She is loath to explain her conduct and behavior and as the townspeople's opinion of her is further tarnished - they are convinced she is living a depraved life, particularly now with the young man's repeated solo visits - she appears to be a condemned and avoided woman, until suddenly she disappears.    The story only darkens and saddens from that point, but I suppose it can be said that it has a brighter ending. Not a happy one, but a brighter one.    I recommend watching it only after you've read the novel. You may enjoy it more.
0312600844|4.0|i don't get all the negative reviews. beautiful writing, a broad twisty narrative. not the equal of \\"the corrections\\" but how many novels are? an absolutlely satisfying read.
B0000683DH|3.0|After the budgetary and scriptwriting debacle of the first film, this one had one primary edict: Make it cheap, make it fast, and don't feel compelled to listen to everything Roddenberry says. And in that respect, it succeeded, and surpassed all expectations.<br /><br />Despite a myriad of technical blunders (what the heck is an energizer, anyway?), occasionally hackneyed dialogue, and characterization that occasionally missed the mark (the Spock-McCoy arguments struck me as a bit too vicious), ST II continues to be an entertaining romp with characters we know better than our own families.<br /><br />Granted, the uniforms were a bit jarring at first, but after a while, they kind of grow on you.<br /><br />Bottom line: As a movie, it's a great action-adventure romp, with great characters, from the familiar Enterprise crew and the now revenge-driven Khan to everyone's favorite Vulcan-Romulan junior officer, Lt. Saavik (Kirstie Alley had just enough of that Romulan passion to show everyone \\"I'm not a Spock clone in drag!\\" Now if only the skinflints at Paramount had ponied up with more cash for the next movie...). As Star Trek, it hits more than it misses, and the misses aren't crucial to the plot anyway, so it still works.
B000069KJ0|2.0|Oh, boy, what a majestic letdown this box set was! I am truly stupefied by the lavish praise accorded to this recording, for both artistically and sonically it is a nearly complete failure.    I will admit right away that I have long since been prejudiced to Lazar Berman, especially to his Liszt, especially to his celebrated recordings of the Transcendental Etudes which, though I have come to see some merit in them, I still think too fast and too insensitive. Be that as it may, I was quite ready to give Mr Berman, in addition to the benefit of doubt, as open and unbiased mind as I could. Being a passionate Lisztian, I think I can safely claim I did in fact do that. Strangely enough, Mr Berman's complete recording of 'Années de pèlerinage' greatly surpassed even the greatest prejudices I could have had.     To say that his performance is very uneven is indeed a gross understatement. Lazar Berman seems to have little idea of the decent tempi, to begin with. Occasionally he slows down so greatly, that the result is all but pure travesty. The most abominable example is 'Angelus' which is more than 10 minutes long (!), nearly twice as long as Leslie Howard's; it goes without saying that a meditative piece like that would benefit from slow tempo - but within a reason. Similarly, Berman's 'Sposalizio' goes way over what is reasonable in terms of slowness; he is even slower than the notoriously slow Jorge Bolet; then again, slow tempi in Bolet's hand create miracles Berman is obviously and painfully incapable of. The man may well be sincere, but such slow tempi in Berman's hands sound contrived and artificial to me, as if he deliberately tries to redeem himself for his shameful rushing of the Transcendentals in his youth. Speaking of tempi, Berman is fond of the other extremity too: the outer parts of his 'Tarantella' are ridiculously rushed. What is even worse is that Berman often forgets that the piano does have pedals; his playing regularly degenerates into percussive and wooden banging. Even Berman's legendary technical prowess seems to have taken a day off during the recording sessions. He is decently capable to pull off 'Orage' and the 'Tarantella' successfully, but he cannot hold a candle to the fiery renditions of Aldo Ciccolini. On the whole, Lazar Berman lacks either passion or poetry in his playing, or, most often, he lacks both.    To be fair to Lazar Berman, he does have several fine moments, particularly in 'La chapelle de Guillaume Tell' where, for once, he gets the slow tempo quite right and creates a fine interpretation or remarkable power. Likewise, his pretty fast tempo in 'Pastorale' sounds charming. At his best, in any of the other 24 pieces Lazar Berman is dependable but hardly recommendable; certainly, his performances here are not in the least 'definitive' or any kind of 'reference'. At his worst, which is unfortunately much more often the case, he is to my mind totally unlistenable.    To be absolutely fair to Lazar Berman, he is partly letdown by simply horrible sound. It beggars belief that this recording was made as late as 1977, for DG and in the Herkulessaal in Munich. The sound is flat, shallow and brittle, with harsh sounds in the high register and total lack of depth in the lower one. The quiet passages usually sound way too distant or muffled, the loud ones take you straight under the lid and all but knock you down. If DG had been capable of shame at all, they really should have been ashamed to have produced such crap of recording, ever. Very poor sound is an understatement indeed!    Lazar Berman's complete recording of 'Années de pèlerinage' is still worth having - at such a bargain price at least. It might - or might not - bear an occasional listening for an interesting touch here and there, only too seldom alas. But taken as a whole or piece by piece, Berman's mindless blend of banging and sleeping is hopelessly inferior to Aldo Ciccolini's passionate yet refined artistry as displayed in hissplendid complete recording on EMI (in fabulous early stereo from 1961); even Leslie Howard on Hyperion (vols. 12, 39, 43), who is by no means without weak spots, puts Berman to shame in terms of musicianship and technique; I don't even want to mention Jorge Bolet's complete recordings of the first two 'years' made for DECCA in the 1980s: these are rarefied planes Berman never even dreamed of. Otherwise, the box set is beautifully produced, with a nice photo of Villa d'Este on the cover and a beautiful booklet with fine essays (the one in English is by Humprey Searle himself, apparently written for the original release in the 1970s) and several gorgeous black-and-white photos. Too bad that such finely presented box set of a great work so seldom recorded in its entirety should be such a great disappointment artistically as well as sonically.
0385733577|5.0|This was a very good book kept me interested the entire time witch isnt an easy thing to do with my short attintion span
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I loved the first season and the second is just as great.  Lots of action, seduction, storyline, supernatural/magic.  Very entertaining.  Watched the whole season in less than a week.  Sad it's the end.  I like series like The Vampire Diaries and True Blood.  It's not vampires but it is a story that definitely kept me wanting to watch more.
B004H0N4PC|5.0|I may be overly influenced by the title track (it's actually called Lippy Kids, but phrase, Build a Rocket Boys features) which is a wonderful atmospheric evocation of early teenage years, but for me this whole album is about being transported back and forth between the here and oh-so-very-adult now and simpler, friendlier times and places.    Be it tales of youth or a call for the friends of youth to come together again, there is much baring of soul and beating of chest, but all done with the lightest and sweetest of touches.     Except when it's a punch in the face.    Elbow excel at mixing apparently simple rhythms and repetitive lyrics to produce songs of massive complexity and meaning. Even the duff ones make you think and there are precious few of those.    Not an instantly likeable or hummable record, but the very definition of a haunting one that after a few initial plays will call back to you like the memory of a younger you.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|Okay, so this wasn't one of Star Trek's proudest moments, but there are some good points to this one (not many, but a few).<br /><br />First off, William Shatner's directorial style is well showcased in this film. It's quick paced, never drags, is suspenseful when it's supposed to be, and, like the director himself, never stops moving. The characterization is uneven, especially with regard to the supporting characters, but the portrayal of the \\"big three\\" of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are as enjoyable as ever, even if they're not served very well by the storyline (all this craziness and introspection, and the big payoff is that Spock can now play \\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\" with a clear conscience? Puhleeeaze!!).<br /><br />And this is the biggest problem with the movie, the plot, and is where most of the problems with characterization and continuity are most prevalent. While the earlier drafts were far worse (for instance, originally, the Enterprise really did find God!), the final product is still far from showing our crew in a very favorable light (experienced Starfleet officers, all legends in their own right, being taken in by a charlatan who better belongs in an airport concourse handing out personality tests? I don't think so...).<br /><br />The best aspects of this movie are 1) at the end, the crew is all ready for the next event, the ship is intact, and all is right with the universe, and 2) this movie was quickly invalidated by the TNG episode \\"Sarek\\" in Picard's opening log entry in the episode's teaser, so it doesn't count anyway. The best way to watch this film is in the form of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 parody, where we get to see it with Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo (\\"It's Super Spock to the rescue!\\").
B000TEUSJK|1.0|I could not wait for this movie to be over.  It was too drawn out and I would never think a movie made in the late 70's would have so many sex scenes and be unrated.  All in all I wouldnt watch it or buy it again.  The story line of the Romans was I think a bit far fetched.  If they did behave in that manner and lived in that manner then they all deserved more than death.  I just think it really was a waste of two hours when I could have watched something far more appealing.  Although Caligula was insane by all means it was just a bit much going on and on and none of the other characters had a chance to progress in the movie it was all about him and no one else.  I really didnt appreciate the way they killed his child in the end that was totally disgusting.  Well actually the whole entire movie was disgusting from him having and incestuous relationship with his sister to him basically raping a virgin on her wedding day.  It was just not my cup of tea.
B002PL5GTC|5.0|THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY VINYL COLLECTOR THAT LIKES THE FOOS.  VERY HIGH QUALITY VINYL AND TOP NOTCH COVER WITH \\"RIVETS\\" IN THE METAL.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I knew nothing of them, and heard two tracks on Sirius XMU on a road trip (Grown Ocean , Battery Kinzie) and had to seek them out.     Bought the album only from previews, and am not regretting it. This is an album that repays repeated listening. I'm not into folk or hippies at all, but this trancends all categories. The vocals are beautiful, and the instrumentation just right.     This makes me think of Santa Cruz and Monterey on a foggy, dismal day. Spots of sun breaking thru, but a cup of hot tea, and a scone and we're good! Road trip material: Yes!
B00168OIOE|5.0|This is an all time great movie.  I would recommend this to anyone although if you can stand the 8 minutes of skipping through previews and unwanted ads. I bought the item why do I need more advertising.  Region free for Aust..  Happy with this item.
B00078XGRO|3.0|Okay, I'll admit I was very doubtful of this one (I got a copy of the synopsis early on, and sent my blow-by-blow dissection to Ron Moore; he never has responded to my comments....), but thankfully, the finished product came out much better than that synopsis (a few key changes, namely leaving out the horribly contradictory backstory for the Borg Queen, and scaling back on a few of the \\"really spectacular\\" moments that we had in store for us, like Data becoming fully human, then being reduced to a \\"Terminator-ish\\" metal skeleton in the final fight with the Borg Queen).<br /><br />A large portion of the credit for this film goes to director Jonathan Frakes, TNG's version of Leonard Nimoy when it comes to having a basic understanding of the material and a respect for the viewership. I'm convinced that if Paramount had stuck with the promotion of this film a little longer, it would have surpassed ST IV's box office totals.<br /><br />We have some excellent character development, at least with regard to Picard, Data, Zefrem Cochrane, and Lily Sloane, no major contradictions in continuity (what does get contradicted is either acknowledged and done is such a way that it leaves open the possibility for an explanation to reconcile it with the established continuity, like the Borg Queen, or the point was conjectural anyway, like the date of Cochrane's first warp flight, and is close enough in this case).<br /><br />Bottom line: Good Star Trek, good action-adventure movie, and an excellent recovery from Generations.
0156013983|5.0|It's very humbling to sometimes struggle for understanding while reading children's books, but I picked this up as part of my journey in teaching myself French.  Before this, I read Le Collier Africain (I've forgotten the author) and also La Loi by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bastiat.  Le Collier had simple grammar (it was made for young French readers), and La Loi was simple as well.  But, the vocabulary and grammar in this book was just right for pushing me forward with my French.<br /><br />The story itself is short but revealing, and makes the reader reflect on his own life.  It's a child's book that does speak down to the reader, and one that parents will also enjoy reading themselves.  I'll likely read it again.
B00004S3AN|5.0|Jaw-dropping.  I have always loved this album, but when I played the SACD version I was absolutely floored by the clarity and imaging from my new Onkyo C-S5VL (you can read my review of *that* thing here on Amazon).  Paul Desmond's alto saxophone just floats in the middle of my living room.<br /><br />This is my new 'checkout my stereo' disc.  Time Out was recorded in 1959; has the music industry forgotten how to execute quality sound engineering?
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The grip for the iPhone works fine (after I figured out how to attach it - no instructions), but the tripod broke in my hands when I first tried to adjust it. That was no problem, since I had another tripod on hand, and now it works perfectly - just what I was looking for. A surprising usefulness is that when folded while attached, the tripod serves as a handle to hold the iPhone/camera while filming.
B0000UJL96|4.0|The Star Trek movie franchise got back into high gear with this one. Basically a commentary on the breakup of the Soviet Union, continuing the long Star Trek tradition of commenting on current events, we get what we've become accustomed to getting from Leonard Nimoy, an excellent story that works as both Star Trek and as a movie. Gene Roddenberry is said to have alternately liked this movie, hated this movie, felt indifferent about this movie, had problems with this movie, and never heard of this movie. Frankly, the only problem I had with this movie was the use of the term \\"right standard rudder\\" when starships don't have rudders, and this term has never been used, before or since, in the entire history of the Star Trek franchise (just a sniggling problem, since it has nothing to do with the plot). That, and the pinkish Klingon blood (done to avoid an \\"R\\" rating for excessive gore; apparently the MPAA doesn't consider it gory if the buckets of blood are colored like Pepto Bismal...). All in all, this was the perfect send-off for the original series characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful features: bookmarks, notes, plans, live prayer requests and an abundance of translations. It's really fast getting to books and chapters. Best of all it's free!

0316019984|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend's grandson.  His 7th birthday is next month.  It is SPECTACULAR.  There are soooo many pop ups in this book!  Big ones in the middle of the page and smaller ones in the corners.  They really are fabulous - even the smaller ones.  Wonder woman's plane really is \\"invisible\\" and she has a real lasso.  They really leap off the page, and the last one is so big it almost hits you in the face! The detail is great with lots of print to read along with it.  And for added effect the bat signal really lights up! I paid $16.00 for it - $20.00 with shipping and it was worth way more.  Amazon's price is much lower than Barnes and Noble and I got a BRAND NEW book.  I highly recommend it.  I have no interest in super heroes (I'm 53) but this is really a great book; I've shown it to everyone.  Not for little ones who might rip it up, but a real collectors item.  Get it!
B00005NB8K|4.0|It's hard to believe that The Doors (1991) is now twenty years old.  It's also hard to believe Jim Morrison has been gone 40 years already.  Time flies.  This movie was made by the always controversial Oliver Stone.  This movie basically centers around the wild lifestyle of lead singer Jim Morrison.<br /><br />Val Kilmer gives a great performance as Jim Morrison.  I don't think any other actor could have done better.  Kyle MacLachlan is also great as keyboardist Ray Manzarek.  Frank Whaley does well as guitarist Robbie Krieger, and Kevin Dillon does a good job as drummer John Densmore.  Meg Ryan is a good Pamela Courson (Morrison's girlfriend).  Kathleen Quinlan is great as Patricia Kennealy (Morrison's mistress).  Look for cameo appearances by Paul Rothschild (the band's producer) and John Densmore.  Also look for Billy Idol, who plays Cat.<br /><br />A lot of things that occur in this movie either never happened, or if they did, were greatly exaggerated.  Keyboardist Ray Manzarek has been quoted many times as saying that certain incidents in the movie never happened, such as the Thanksgiving scene, the exaggerated performance of Light My Fire on The Ed Sullivan Show, etc.  There are also some factual errors in the movie.<br /><br />One thing I don't like about this movie is the fact that Oliver Stone portrayed Jim Morrison as a self-centered out of control drunk.  He exaggerated everything, which is typical of Stone.  I've read lots of books on Morrison and The Doors going back to the early 1980s and watched many videos/documentaries.  Morrison had a sense of humor that was absent in the movie.  He was very cerebral as well.  He wasn't wild ALL the time, but he was a great deal of the time.  Early in the movie all four band members vow to stick together, support each other no matter what, and do everything unanimously, but as the movie progresses, Manzarek, Densmore, and Krieger increasingly turn against Morrison as Morrison's behavior gets more and more out of control.  I found this interesting but understandable, because when one of the band members is totally out of control, the band can't do everything unanimously and without conflict.  This is the result of Oliver Stone choosing to portray Morrison as TOTALLY out of control.  Stone should have taken the middle road when portraying Morrison, wild but not TOO wild, but his goal is to entertain the movie audience by exaggerating things.<br /><br />I saw Ray Manzarek perform live, by himself, at Pine Knob Music Theater in Clarkston, MI in July 2002.  I'll tell you, it was one of the best performances I've ever seen at a concert venue, even though it was just Manzarek and a keyboard on stage.  The other artists there that night were Vanilla Fudge and Jefferson Starship.  Jefferson Starship gave an absolutely terrible performance, with sound problems and no Grace Slick.  It was the worst concert I've ever seen.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie that will take you to the hippie generation of 1960s America and allow you to see the story (flaws and all) of one of the great rock bands of all time.teresting but understandable, because when one of the band members is totally out of control, the band can't do everything unanimously and without conflict.

B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|I wouldn't buy this album if you've ever listened to any other Keane CD's and liked them... What can I say but it's hardly like his other work and it's like he has \\"guests\\" on the CD that make it a \\"Night Train\\"-wreck.  Dear Lord, please forgive that stupid rapper for thinking he has poetic license.  It's like he's making it up as he goes.  (Okay, if you've never heard Keane before, you might actually like this CD....maybe 3 stars........Wow I hope Keane doesn't end up like U2...sucking wind to make music for more money.)

B00004XONN|5.0|I can't really add anything more to the positive reviews of this album.  It is amazing.  If you don't like it, it's almost certainly because you don't understand it.    Now, I'm really enjoying reading all the old 1-star reviews of this album and then reading the similar reviews of the new \\"Limbs\\" album.  Kid A has not only stood the test of time and proven those 1-star reviewers wrong, but has continued to build on its legacy.  It's a fair guess to say that the same will be the case with King of Limbs.

1439102813|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me when my father no longer knew who I was, or that he even had a daughter.  This book was the only one I've seen written from the perspective of the Alzheimers patient.  Although I can never be certain, this booked seemed the closest I would ever get to knowing what was going on in my dad's head...what was he thinking when he looked at me, how did he feel when he no longer knew how to zip a zipper, open a door, wash his face, etc?  Did he know how sick he was?  Did that pain him, or was he blissfully unaware of how much he had lost?  Still Alice was heart-wrenchingly honest; I cried from the time Alice no longer knew her own daughter right through to the end.    Such an awful disease, and one that will devastate this country as the baby boomers reach the key Alzheimers demographic.  Books like this one are needed for several reasons, to provide comfort to those in the middle of the the disease and to sound a warning bell to those not yet aware of what Alzheimers does to individuals and families.

B001UV4XI8|4.0|This movie is good overall. It can be entertaining and fun. Some parts, however, were either slow or kind of silly. For instance, when Ron leaves the group, barely anything happens. Of course, that's not the case. Harry gets to see his parents graves, which should it have been a strong scene, but it didn't felt like that.  Also, it didn't felt like these guys knew what they were doing and when they went to the Ministry of Magic. This is extra, but didn't Harry saved hundreds of wizards that day? Well I guess they missed that too. I had a lot of expectations and maybe that's why I'm a bit disappointed. But I'm pretty sure most people will like it.   This purchase actually includes a blu-ray, a DVD and a digital copy, which you can redeem using iTunes or Windows Media Player. It also includes a sneak peek to a scene from HP 7 part 2. For me this seemed like an awesome deal. I own many portable iDevices which stream my computer content or syncs as well. I recommend this buy if you own a tablet or a smartphone that's WMV compatible or MOV compatible.
0547260695|5.0|I've collected pop-up books for several years.  \\"The Little Prince\\" is one of my two favorite books. I used to carry a copy of it to give to anyone I met who hadn't read it. My daughter's boyfriend gave me this book for Christmas and I was beside myself with joy!  It contains the entire story, and is illustrated beautifully.  I will treasure this book forever.
0375842209|5.0|I almost couldn't finish this book - I was completely taken in, and felt I knew the characters, that they were people close to me.  I finally did finish, but it was tough and emotional.  This book is unique, a stand apart tale of a child growing up amidst chaos, poverty, and death, yet living to the best of her ability.  Although the book is billed as young adult, I think it's appropriate for everyone above the age of 14.  I originally bought this book for my 12 year old son, but always read books about tough subject matter first.  Although the content is appropriate enough, the narration may be a bit difficult for him to follow.  Because I find this such an important read, I've chosen to set it aside for a few years so that when he does read it, it will impact him fully as it did me.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|This movie is great! The ad said it was brand new, which it wasn't. The disney movie rewards points sheet was missing, but I was promptly reimbursed and the film is wonderful. It ended up being an all around good experience.

0811874192|5.0|Instead of giving me roses when I produced my first show, my daughter gave me this book, which has stunning floral arrangements which could be used as centerpieces for most occasions.  It is one of the most delightful pop-up books I've ever seen.

0670022411|1.0|Two major issues with this book -     -- Where is the ending?  There was no indication anywhere that this was merely the first book in a series.  I trod through 600 plus pages of endless tea/wine drinking, panic attacks, vampire adoration and even entire chapters where she does nothing but sleep - only to discover this book literally HAS NO ENDING. So yes, you are expected to wait until the NEXT book to find out what happens. If anything. As if I would actually spend money on a sequel after being setup like this.     -- Where is the magic?  She was born with nearly every witchy power there is - you name it, she has it (and DNA test to prove it!) Sooo....This is a book about the most powerful witch OF ALL TIME -- and has virtually NO MAGIC. Except the tiny occasions when some other witch does it. Or she freaks out and does it by mistake, then feels guilty. I kept thinking pretty soon, it's getting toward the end here, she's going to do some real magic. I mean, it IS a book about witches, right? And I can't tell you how many times I read over and over and over about all the awesome RARE powers she has. Any time now. Oh wait! There was something! She got panicked and shot an arrow of witchfire. Surely it's going to start happening now. Surely? Please? Nope.     I suppose, technically, I need to be fair and say the Title is 'A Discovery of Witches' - and well, yeah, you do discover she's a witch. Who likes tea. But that's about it. In short, save your money. Don't get fooled by the marketing hype that surrounds this book.

B004KA9MQO|2.0|Oh dear, poor Jennifer Hudson, a voice that hasn't met its opportunities.  This is a boring collection of songs, poorly produced, lacking imaginative arrangements and doing nothing for the voice.  Don't Look Down is a poor copycat of an Ashford/Simpson take or Sam Dees/Gladys Knight take.  Do we need another version of Feeling Good - \\"no\\" is the answer, especially with this poor arrangement.  She has a voice, but this is listless, boring, with no testing of the her real talent - her voice - but what do you expect from Clive Davis when he is in contol.  I've just realised the ending to Feeling Good is so awful.  This is passion-less stuff.  Not Jennifer's fault, but get her a decent producer and take her way from this mass consumerasit nonsense.  Thank goodness for the song Believe, which you can believe in.  Please give her songs and production that serves her fabulous voice, and make sure it gives her the opportunity to express her soul... goodness what a waste of talent.  So wasted.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Well, it works, but it is a little disappointing. When you import pictures from a CF card, it imports two copies, and when the connection is removed, one of the collections disappears. Just confusing. Also, it won't work on my iPhone 4 even though the plug fits, which is a disappointment.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|I don't really know what to say.  It's Toy Story.  The movie is amazing and its on Blu-ray so it looks awesome.  I would recommend it.
B0009X75RO|4.0|This is a really fun musical. Murder, fame, and jazz! It doesn't get much better than that. I like the burlesque, show-girl feel of it.
B000002J29|4.0|For a second live album, this compilation is a good set of live music from 76 and 77. Touching back to music from Foxtrot and Nursery Cryme gave this album some color, and some historic coverage. Essential to any Genesis collection, I would recommend it to the Genesis listener.     I take away one star for this issue: almost no material from Wind and Wuthering is on this live set. There is one song, and it's not the best song from that album. 'Eleventh Earl of Mar' and 'All In a Mouse's Night' would have been excellent additions to this, as well as 'In That Quiet Earth.' As it stands, we have only the lone 'Afterglow' representing the entire album on this set. Not a good representation at all, considering all of the excellent material on W&W. What would I have sacrificed in exchange? Perhaps one of the three songs from 'Selling England By the Pound,' and 'Robbery Assault and Battery,' to make room for a couple more W&W songs. I might get disagreements on those choices, but I figure something would have to go. And even with those songs gone, the remaining songs of those albums would still represent them well on the \\"new-improved\\" Seconds Out.
B004MPAFFE|5.0|Amon Amarth did not dissapoint with this album / slightly more melodic, but still as crushing as they need to be. The limited box set is a very cool version of this album (albeit suprisingly difficult to get a hold of on day of release!), loved to dvd and it's interesting to hear the 2 cover songs (Accept & KISS) that show another side of the band and obviously some of their early influences. Recommended.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|I have read other books of Matt and feel that he has a clear style. There are lots of books around how science has changed our world and how it will change it even further in the future. Most of the books picture a pessimist outcome on what we will experience. However Matt provides evidence from the past on how this did not happen. I think he really makes a case for rational optimist the title of the book. The world of the future he envisions is in line with Ray Kurzweil's [[ASIN:0143037889 The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]] and Joel Carreau's [[ASIN:0767915038 Radical Evolution: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies -- and What It Means to Be Human]]. They are all saying that we will enjoy a higher level of interconnectedness together with unpredictability.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|So... just taking a look at some of the banter in the threads below....<br /><br />What is wrong with you people?  It's just a book.  A fictional story created for your entertainment--or not.  If you don't like it, fine.  Don't read it then.  Don't slog 600+ pages through a book you thoroughly despise just so you can vent your spleen about it later--you're not a frickin' martyr, you're just annoying.  Just put the book down and walk away...<br /><br />*sigh* anyway, I myself enjoyed this book quite a lot.  I wasn't recommended it by anyone, I just saw it in the kindle store, downloaded a sample (as always), liked the sample a lot, then bought the book.  It took me awhile to really get into it, and yes, there were a few parts that may have dragged a little, but by the time the plot got rolling I caught up.  There was a feel of... realness to it, that is sometimes lacking in this genre.  And by that, i'm not referring to events or world creation--i'm referring to the way characters act and react--to the way their actual speech isn't--for the most part--corny or contrived.  The descriptions edge a little towards the grandiose, but that can be attributed to Rothfuss' style.  I will be buying the sequel....which is twice as long, according to the file size :p<br /><br />Again, this is something to be read for entertainment.  It didn't make me a better person, nor did I expect it to.  It's just a big, whopper of a story that I can really get into.
B000AADYUI|5.0|a lot of people cringe when they hear of jefferson starship, a group that later mutated into an offshoot band featuring js members called starship. mainly recalling their dated, poppy, eighties sound that people love to hate. i assure you that this 1970 album by paul kantner and jefferson starship is closer akin to the late sixties/early seventies albums by js predecessor band, jefferson airplane. if you like pre darkside of the moon pink floyd, crosby stills nash and young and the grateful dead's late sixties/early seventies music, you will definitely dig this album. don't let the stigma associated with the name 'starship' delude you, this album kicks serious psychedelic/space rock arse!

You may pay a few<br />dollars more, but will likely get vastly improved picture and sound<br />quality, as well as more and better extras.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorite movies. I think that it so so much more then a love story. It's a life story and layered with so much rich, spiritual meaning that it's a movie you have to see more then one time to really soak it in. If you are looking for something brilliant, thought provoking and entertaining this is your movie!   I know it did not get a lot of great reviews but I personally think the reason for this is that many people just don't get it. I urge you to open your mind and give it another chance.

B000J5XS3C|4.0|I've owned this board for a couple months now and I've definitely gotten use out of it.  This board is great for small-scale live performances / DJing / podcasting.  It's light, simple to use, and has a nice fx channel (that can be used with a loop pedal for looping multiple instruments). It also gives you an extra output  The sound is a little better than I expected, but there is a small fuzz (especially at high-gain).  I'd recommend purchasing it with a bundle. There's one that has an audio interface, headphones, and a microphone.  I keep this board safe because I feel like it's not too sturdy (but so far so good).  The power LED is oddly bright (and blinding); you'll need a flash light to see what you're doing in low-light settings.  This board isn't even too bad for recording (but if you're trying to record something to use professionally, you might want to buy a more expensive board)
0061134007|5.0|Hardly ever have I been so furious at real-world responsibilities.     There weren't any when I finished The Secret History in 2 days.  That novel, like the one I'm reading now, is a mystery.  I fell in love with mysteries a few years earlier, when my father bought me a seminal Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None.  It became clear to me that when one of these books was good, everything in life felt like time between finding out more.  I never want to guess who the killer is, and I never want to be able to put together the whole story.  When it happens on Law & Order (RIP), guessing correctly disappoints.  With a book it devastates.  And a book has time to do something huge.    Jo Nesbø goes big in The Redbreast.  He goes to the Eastern Front during WWII, he goes to the Neo-Nazi elements of modern Oslo, and makes side trips to Vienna and Johannesburg.  My man Henning Mankell goes international once in a while.  The ominous global and historical nature of The Redbreast dwarfs Mankell's, and Nesser's, efforts to expand into a truly epic idea, one that dives back into history and explodes onto the page.  The Redbreast has heft, it teaches the reader about a hidden chapter of European history, and the pacing - despite jumps through time and space, and shifting narrators, so often ingredients for distraction and disaster - is pitch-perfect.  I could not put it down.     Then there's Harry Hole.  This man I absolutely love.  I picture him as Nesbø's author photo on my edition.  This guy smokes cigarettes, weathers leather, and drives an old Ford Escort.  He shaves his head because he feels like it and beds the hot girl.  There's definitely swagger and depth to Wallander, and brooding intelligence.  Van Veeteren has his trademark arrogance and cynicism.  Hole is someone I want to run along with in the action movie, yelling curses and chasing down the bad guy after a sudden epiphany in a trashed apartment.  Nesbø does well with the other major characters, too, all of whom hold distinct identities and consistently engaged my interest when they took over the story.     Harry, like so many great investigators, dodges the commands of his superiors.  He spots and follows the case outside his official duties, his instincts telling him to seek connections between the black market sale of a German rifle, a bloody murder outside a known Neo-Nazi hangout, and the ongoing activities of a recently acquitted (on a technicality) skinhead murderer.  At first, I had my reservations, as Nesbø took me from Harry's perspective to soldiers on the Eastern front in 1944 and back again to a foreign affairs minister in present day.  The bouncing around and the huge number of characters introduced, however, failed to become an issue.  Nesbø keeps control over the scope of his novel and the crowd within it.    I'm skeptical of books with such ambitious elements.  I couldn't follow Suite Française and its myriad of narrators.  I almost never read historical fiction, perhaps because it feels safer to trust my learning about the past to nonfiction and biography authored by university professors and graying historians.  Somehow I trusted Jo Nesbø anyway.  Briefly I wanted to start a sketch of all the characters to keep track, but Nesbø guides his reader with gentle clues and timely repetitions and I only found myself flipping back the pages once or twice.  The unraveling - I can only tell you that every stumble over strange Nordic names and unfamiliar territory will pay off.  I'm glad I have the next two in the series.  The prior books have yet to be published in the U.S..  I expect they will be soon.  Otherwise I'm going to have to learn Norwegian.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I usually read murder mysteries, but a friend recommended this book and it was one of the best books I ever read!  I cried during the first and last chapters and a couple times in between.  Makes  me love my dog more!  A true soul cleansing book.

0316056863|3.0|This book is about Tina's days with improv, writing/staring on SNL, 30 Rock, bits about her life growing up, and life lessons.  It's not a tell all book and can get a bit confusing as to what kind of book it is.  There were funny parts and interesting facts but it made you wanting to know more.     If you are a fan of Tina's and are into 30 Rock and SNL you will love this book.
B004HO6HWA|3.0|What would you do for revenge?  After both losing someone close to them Bishop (Statham) and Steve (Foster) begin the hunt for revenge. When secrets are revealed the stakes get higher. After watching the original a few days ago I knew a little about what to expect with this one. Statham is a very lethal assassin that specializes in \\"accident-like\\" killings. When his boss gives him a target he doesn't agree with he begins to uncover a web of lies that changes the way he thinks. This was a pretty typical action movie. A little like \\"The Transporter\\" mixed with \\"Assassins\\". I was hoping for a better movie, but was not disappointed. Very entertaining with a few slow parts. Not bad, but could have been better. About as good as the original, the ending in the original I liked better though. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - If it was on TV I may watch a little of it.<br /><br />*Also try - Game Of Death & The Mechanic (Original)
0684857219|4.0|Hi, I have read the good and the bad opinions and quite frankly I am astonished. Im a 6.1 205 10% bf Male and work as a trainer. I am Poliquin Certifed Lvl 2 and work for a Lvl 5 in is own private gym. I ahve read cover to cover the \\"enclopedia of arnold\\" \\"Bodybuilding the complete encyclopedia\\" and \\"huge and freaky\\" When I read reviews that state that following any of those book work outs will plundge you in overtraining I die a little inside. Each and everyone of these books are so afraid that you actually overtrain that their routine are just incredibly short...I mean 3 bodyparts a day on a 3 day split and 4 days rest (all books offer this approach first) if you manage to overtain with this....well there is something about nutrition, sleep and supplementation that you did not understand. Most of these routines in each books (excluding arnolds book) are less intense and on a bigger split than what I actually perform. In arnold's Book tough, the work out load is actually good unfortunately the training time per session is too high ( the split should be perfomed on more days or two times a day in some case)..recent studies are quite categoric that training session should be limited to 70 minutes MAX for quite a bit of good reason (check out Charles Poliquin site if you are curious about this statement) The info in this book are to be use as tool not bible to be followed. Different approach and style to help developp your own thing. But to do this you need PROPER NUTRITION. I strongly recommend to anyone attempting training on his own to read multiple nutrition books and advice by men Like DR. Bowden (nutrition) and Charles Poliquin (training nutrition and supplementation). This book is very interesting and the training routines are varied. The 4 star is because the nutrional advice altough good is not for everyone...if your lactose or gluten intolerant forget about following anything by the book. Also if your like me and have a tendency to chunk up on carbs....you'll put on muscle but unavoidably fat; try to cut carb. Bottom line is I recommend every of these books, but these books dont say EVERYTHING, you need more knowledge I strongly suggest a beginner to employ a certified coach to start him up.
B000SEI230|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author!  I have a really hard time reading and comprehending 99% of authors and their books. But Nicholas Sparks books are very easy and most of all enjoyable to read! He is the only author that I've actually read the entire book from cover to cover. I can't put down his books, they are so good. I read them so fast that I then find myself waiting for him to write a new one because I've read all he has written so far. He can't write them fast enough for me. A walk to Remember is a record for me, I finished it within a week, reading only at bedtime on my I-pad.      A Walk to Remember is a good love story with a twist. It ranks in at #3 (#1 was the notebook, #2 the wedding)
B0041YI4ZO|5.0|I've already bought this DVD, IP Man The Legend Is Born. (some call it IP Man Zero or even IP Man 3 - that's fine)   I also want to get this version that has English* Audio on it too.   I've looked everywhere but I can't find it, yet!   Did any company make this with English Audio?   *  ...yes yes I know the original language audio of these films with all its nuisances, inflections, meanings, etc, is definitely the best! ...I realize that and there is no debate about that okay :)   Besides that though, I just want to have an English audio version too!   I already have IP Man 1 & 2 in its original Hong Kong versions and languages, excellent, and the Blu Ray versions of 1 & 2 have them in English Audio too which I also have - but, I don't see anyway yet to get IP Man 3 in English yet?
B002ZG99IG|3.0|How bad was your college roommate?  After Sara (Kelly) meets her new college roommate Rebecca (Meester) she thinks she has found a new friend.  When Sara starts to do things without Rebecca strange things begin to happen.  Let me first start by saying that this is not a bad movie, but it is definatly geared toward a specific age group, and it's not mine.  For the 19-20 year olds this will be very creepy.  For the older crowd this is a definate remake of \\"Single White Female\\", but in my opinion not as good.  For those who have not seen that movie this will be very creepy.  For those that have seen that movie you will notice the very simaler scenes and ideas.  Again this is actually not a bad movie, but if I was 10 years younger and a girl this would really scare me.  If you are older like me and want to be creeped out by a movie like this one, I'd stick with the original \\"Single White Female\\".  I will say the Leighton Meester, in a departure from her usual roles, did a really great job of playing a creepy stalker.  I just could not really get in to this movie.  I give it a B-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think I would, but it made me want to watch \\"Single White Female\\" again.<br /><br />*Also Try - Kalamity & Single White Female

0061743526|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee, was a truely, amazing book.  It is very informative, and was descriptive by the way Harper wrote it, like the characters. She gave Scout, Jem, Atticus, and Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, a great description, great story, and awesome major plot points. She added the right amount of suspense, drama, humor, and southerness and it came to be a wonderful jolly book. Now I can understand why it is called \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" because it was almost like Tom Robinson was the Mockingbird and Bob Ewell was a careless, mischevious person who just killed a person so pure, so innocent, and get away with it, but only have something bad happen to you in return. Since it was Bob Ewells fault that when he accused Tom Robinson, the result from the chain reaction was that it ended with Tom Robinson gettin shot and Bob Ewell getting killed by his own hand. But, like Atticus said \\"You can shoot all the Bluejays you want, but it is a sin to kill a Mockingbird.\\"
0061801313|1.0|I was so excited to read these books because I love the TV series and had read in reviews that if you like the show you will LOVE the books. I started reading the first one and I made it to about 80 pages before I closed it, never wanting to open the cover again.<br /><br />First of all, I don't think it is appropriate for anyone in the age category of \\"young adult\\" where this it targeted to. (I'm in my mid 20's) Within those first 80 pages the F Bomb was dropped like 3 times (and I didn't even get past half of the book so I can only assume there were more)If you think about that if a movie has more than one incidence of this then it is rated R, which by law you have to be 17 to see. hummmm. And I wouldn't say that the characters are wholesome by any means in the show but they are much MUCH worse in the book with language and actions.<br />Also I thought the writing was not the greatest in the book. Granted it is a \\"young adult\\" book but from what I read the characters seemed a bit flat and maybe the author was trying to make it sound like a teenager, and I liked the Twilight books so i'm ok with sounding like a teen, but there were times I thought \\"really? she wrote that?\\"<br />So ANYway, if you have any problems with major swearing and bad writing then just stick with the tv show.

1401307787|5.0|I first became interested in exploring Buddhism about 2 years ago, when I was in search of a more spiritual relationship with people and the universe around me. Around that time, I saw the PBS special on the Buddha which raised my interest.  I went to the library and took out the easiest and shortest books that I could find.  But every beginner's book on the shelf seemed too confusing and too loaded with details on Buddhism.  I was still interested but I wanted a book that offered a nutshell of the subject matter.  Earlier this year, a friend loaned me a book on Tai Chi because it offered some details on Buddhism and meditation.  It was in that book that I found mention of \\"WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE YOU ARE\\".  I returned to the library and read it twice and I decided that I needed to have my own copy in order to make my notes on things worthwhile and points to be remember.  I found this book so easy to understand. It is practical for everyday use without the deep philosophy in traditional Buddhist beginner books.  I now understand that most Buddhists call this type of book sectarian type teaching because it is really not a study of Buddhism but rather the practical aspects of the Buddhist Path.  This is exactly the type of book that I spiritually needed.  Now, if I decide to study Buddhism, I will understand the philosophy much better.
0307454541|4.0|I liked this story although, again being full of foreign words/people/places, etc., it was a bit slow going.  Actual movement really didn't begin until mid way through the story.  Rather a deep introspection into moral attitudes in Sweden with some background information as well.  I will eventually finish the trilogy, but am not so captivated by it that it's a must read immediately.

B000002U82|5.0|Have you ever been to a five star restaurant? I haven't, but from what I've heard the chef will often create a new meal every day. You don't order from a menu, you eat whatever the chef prepares. The food is unique, exquisite and served in a combination in which each successive course perfectly complements the last.    That's how this album is. It's not just a bunch of songs thrown on an album together, its a musical mosaic - essentially one piece of music divided into overlapping sections. To try to divide it into individual songs and rate them separately is akin to taking a great novel and treating every chapter as its own work. Each chapter is different but equally necessary in telling the story and to praise one while dismissing another would be not only futile but downright silly. So it is with Dark Side of the Moon. Those who would divide it into pieces or simply dismiss it outright either have no taste for complex and introspective music or are too caught up in the radio single mentality to appreciate the work as a whole.    Dark Side of the Moon approaches the pinnacle of human musicianship with its haunting lyrics and flawless execution. Every instrument and harmony works together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Powerful and at times delicate this dark and brooding album will leave you wanting more every time you play it.
B0031ESW8O|5.0|It has been a long time since I have enjoyed reading a fiction book as much as I enjoyed this one.  The narrative was told by a serier of characters and the author was wonderful in staying true to her character's personality.  This was the first book I read on my new kindle and it has made me a kindle advocate.  What a great way to read a book!

We've always been told, often with \\"up from the bootstraps\\" Alger allegories, that it takes hard work, smarts, and determination to be a success. However, things like family background and socio-economic status really do matter. Even plain old luck, such as where and when you were born, can make a huge difference. Measured IQ may afford an advantage, but only to a point. Those intent on the big prize must perfect their craft over the course of 10,000 hours, just as Bill Gates, the Beatles, and Michael Jordan did.

The acting is great, the stories are even better!  Yes, some of the special FX are not the most amazing ever seen, however, it really doesn't take anything away from the fun of this show!  I love watching the episodes over and over again!  The season ends very strong and leads into an even better second season!  I dare you to watch this show and not wish you had a TARDIS!
B004HO6HWK|1.0|This was not a bad flick. A perfect popcorn movie for a raining Saturday afternoon. My wife picked up the DVD this morning and I'll return it tomorrow afternoon.The special feature consists of extended/deleted scenes. That's it. No director commentary, no 'making of' segment, no actor/editor/crew/cast commentary - just a crummy extended/deleted scenes bit. I want my money back and that will happen.  I called Best Buy and asked if the Blu-Ray had special features. The only thing different was a tiny feature-ette on guns and BD connect. Yawn. Big deal. Shame on whoever produced this piece of junk DVD.
1577311523|5.0|When I started reading this book, a friend had recommended it to me. After I had read the first 5 pages I had a lot to think about and a lot to change. Through this book, which I am not done reading yet, I have learned to tailor my thoughts to be productive instead of destructive. I have learned how to appreciate what is happening now, how to smell, taste, see, feel and hear again. No matter what faith you belong to, this book strengthens beliefs already in place, and serves to show you how to better practice them. I would recommend this book to everyone. If we lived by what it suggests, there would be serious global change. We would be united, fearless, and peaceful. This book is worth 200 times what I paid for it. Finally some clear practical sense in written form.
B0034G4P80|5.0|You get a feeling sometimes, a feeling of hopelessness as summer comes along, the same old stuff in new package is in 3D, sometimes it explodes a lot, but most of the times it is, inevitably, crap. Talking about movies of course. And other times, you get a really good summer blockbuster. Thor belongs to the latter category.<br /><br />Summer blockbusters have traditionally been a money-fest, rushed 3D releases with lot of lacklustre performances and lots of explosions to keep the popcorn cracking. Very few directors try to take the next step in actually weaving in a good movie storyline or plot or inspire their actors to at least deliver their lines properly. Kenneth Branagh is one director who does all those things. And more.<br /><br />It seems Hollywood and comic-book movies have found their ticket to ultimate success. Hire an English director, get a non-American actor and make producers shell out lots and lots of money. But there is something different about Thor, making it unique from recent super-hero movies which have performed commendably. It is hard to point out that abstract something, so I will list all the good things about the movie and hopefully imbibe you with that intangible quality the movie possesses.<br /><br />Firstly, Asgard's design. We have come across many CGI landscapes and planets now, but nothing the computer animators have ever made (with an exception of Pandora) comes even close to Asgard's design. This is the ultimate fix for an escapism--junkee. I felt Asgard was a separate entity of the movie, in all its glory, shining like a beacon of hope for good movies. It looked so great that the scenes taking place in Midgard (Earth) felt like they were biting into the movie minutes, long minutes when they could have offered more of Asgard. One of the few things I'll ever criticise as \\"There is just not enough of it\\".<br /><br />Now the acting. Chris Hemsworth really brings the Norse God of Thunder into life and coats him with a sense of inexplicable charm. Every scene that he is in, especially the ones with the costume on, is transformed from mundane to exquisite art. Anthony Hopkins is the obvious highlight. I think I can safely say that calling the actor the highlight of a movie is like calling chicken the highlight of Chicken Steak. If there was ever an Odin, he was Anthony Hopkins. Tom Hiddleston completes the trio of awesomeness with his wit and talent as the mischievous Loki. At times, he felt like the main character of the movie.<br /><br />A minor gripe is that the supporting characters were not given enough highlight. Idris Elba brought his own as Heimdall, every delivery worth every cent I paid. I think Kat Dennings' lines were humourous, Skargard played an amazing character. Last but not the least, Natalie Portman, was good, but her talent felt a bit underused here. Sure, as the female lead in a pre-dominantly male super-hero movie, you don't get much focus, but she was a fresh Oscar winner, guys! Give her emotional lines!<br /><br />Lastly the direction. This is where it gets fun. Mr. Branagh is director of Shakespearean plays. If any director, after seeing this movies says \\"This is exactly how I would have done\\", I would say \\"Don't kid yourself\\". Branagh is the next Nolan and that is saying something. Converting the well-set movie universe with down-to-earth scientific and technological aspects into one which had Thor, Odin and Asgard (gods and magic) was a Herculean task, as evidenced from the development hell the movie went through. I would say no-one was a better choice than Branagh, and I fear after making Thor, there is nowhere to go but down for Mr. Branagh. Prove me wrong, man! (Hopefully he does all the Thor movies). This guy is so good, in fact, that I can't wait for people to bitch about how he got snubbed at the Oscars. That's really saying something.<br /><br />And the 3D? Go  for it! This is not your average money-making gimmick. The action sequences, already phenomenal and gargantuan, really shine in the 3D. All the shots of Asgard get a new dimension of depth as well as reality with the third dimension.<br /><br />A must-see for everyone.<br /><br />Chinmay Hota<br />Author of Hits and Misses'get a new dimension of depth as well as reality with the third dimension.

0345529057|1.0|I would love to have this series on my Kindle. But why on earth would I pay double the price of the paperback books?  Seeing as the kindle version costs the publisher nothing in overhead costs, and costs Amazon nothing to send this is ridiculous. You have lost a sale.
1430233834|5.0|I was compelled to write a review for this book after reading couple of very unfair reviews, one reviewer gave the book a 1 star because the kindle version doesn't work and the other reviewer gave it a 1 star because the examples don't work.<br /><br />First off HTML5 is just not plain old html it involves CSS and a lot of JavaScript so if you have no programming, background then it will take significant effort on your part to get the examples working as intended.  I think the author has done an excellent job.  HTML5/CSS/JavaScript is taught through implementation of gaming concepts, in my opinion if you work through this book you will significantly improve your programming skills.<br /><br />You will learn about calculating positions for objects on the screen, collision detection, Form Validation, generating and using random numbers, plenty of conditional logic, loops, arrays, writing functions and function calls, creating user defined objects, translating and rotating drawings and images, mouse events, timing events, storing/retrieving data in the browser using localStorage and lots of calculations.  There is plenty of code to play around with and very detailed and sometimes repetitive explanations which I don't consider to be a negative.  While doing the examples its possible that you could have unmatched braces, misspelled variables or functions which can lead to the code not running as intended, but if you find debugging code a tedious task then programming is probably not the right vocation for you.<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars because in my opinion the programming content is solid, well explained and if you go though the examples your skills will be above average.  I will recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning HTML5/CSS and specially JavaScript.
0894803123|5.0|If you love ice cream then this book is for you!!! Great recipes that are easy to make.  I have to say that it may be less expensive to buy the ice cream than to make it!!  My favorite is the New York super fudge chunk and I realized that I need to buy higher quality chocolate for it to compare with the real Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  I also use the lower fat options in cream, so I'm sure that it's not quite as good as the store brand for those reasons.  I made some coconut pineapple that was really good!!!  My daughter in law is an ice cream lover and has probably made every recipe in the book!! She loves it too.  We got the cuisinart automatic ice cream maker for Christmas, so we throw in the ingredients and 20 minutes later we have homemade ice cream!!!!  Can't beat it.  This book is a winner!

1439102724|5.0|Sing me Home is another great novel that takes a current moral and political issue and gives it a story that so many will relate to. In the beginning of the book your heart breaks for Zoe, a music therapist who wants a child so badly, and has a terrible miscarriage. Her husband Max, who also has fertility issues, cannot afford any more of the IVF or the emotional consequences of all their failed attempts at having children. This leads to the dissolving of their marriage and Max, a recovering alcoholic turns to drinking to cope with the loss. Zoe then meets Vanessa, a counselor at a local high school who requests music therapy for one of her students. The two become close friends, and eventually realize their feelings are more then just friendship. After getting married in another state, Zoe and Vanessa decide that they would like to have children, however Zoe has had a hysterectomy and cannot carry a child. She does however have an embryo left from her prior IVF with Max and she decides to get the embryo implanted in Vanessa. When she goes to Max to make the request he is living with his conservative brother who is a member of a church that has strong opinions against homosexuality and he decides to deny their request and instead asks that he get the embryo to \\"give\\" to his brother and his wife who have also been unsuccessful at having kids. This begins a legal battle that brings in a character of a lawyer that is provided by the church to help make a political statement and spectacle over their \\"custody\\" dispute. Throughout the trial Max grows closer to his brother's wife, and realizes that he is in love with her and that is the main influence on his decision to give them the embryo. The trial takes a toll on both Max and Zoe, and in the end the judge rules for the embryo to be given to Max. He does the right thing and promptly hands it over to Zoe, and in the end they have formed a mixed family around their daughter. This is another one of those books that makes you think about what you would do in a given situation, and is beautifully written from the many perspectives that Jodi Piccoult is known for. This is a must read book.<br /><br />Book Rating: 5/5<br />Book Received From: Atria / Simon & Schuster for Review<br />Reviewer: Gabi for Book Sakeyou think about what you would do in a given situation, and is beautifully written from the many perspectives that Jodi Piccoult is known for.

B00062IVKS|5.0|\\"Raging Bull\\" is a wonderfully made movie about a life hardly worth telling about. Robert De Niro poured himself into the role of Jake La Motta as much & as well as any actor possibly could. Artistically, the movie could not have been better. But what a pathetic life was portrayed. But I have a question. Could anyone please explain to me why a passage from the Bible was quoted at the very end of the movie? There is nothing in the story of La Motta to explain why that was done.
B00338QENI|5.0|A masterful combination of scientific history and family story, this book looks at a world I'm incredibly familiar with in a way that I never would have imagined.

B003HE2B6C|3.0|[ 2 1/2 Stars ] This isn't the worst thing I've ever heard; however, being that it was released after the likes of \\"This Time Around,\\" \\"Underneath,\\" and the \\"Stand Up, Stand Up\\" EP, it leaves a lot to be desired. It's not the songs are necessarily bad, it's just that they're not Hanson's most inspired work. I haven't been particularly fond of their more recent releases (post TTA) largely because the more recent albums are lacking thematically as they show no signs of musical growth. 2007's \\"The Walk\\" was preachy at best in its effort to be full of deep \\"obviously trying too hard\\" lyrical themes ..And when it wasn't trying too hard, it was otherwise just another batch of boring or moderately catchy, dismissible pop songs.     \\"This Time Around\\" managed to surprise even casual music listeners with a \\"wiser then their years\\" sense of maturity, and despite being thirteen the first time I heard this album, I knew they'd have a hard time bordering on the depth of songs like \\"This Time Around,\\" \\"A Song to Sing\\" and \\"Sure About It.\\" There were pop songs on this album, but it had enough substance to allow the songs with lighter themes to blend in with and be carried by the wider range in lyrical content.      \\"Underneath\\" is otherwise forgettable minus songs like \\"Strong Enough To Break,\\" \\"Underneath,\\" \\"Believe,\\" \\"Hey\\" and of course, \\"Penny and Me.\\" \\"Penny and Me\\" can easily be dismissed as a poppy summer song, but it lends itself well to a multitude of interpretations. \\"Penny and Me\\" was the potential comeback song that wasn't promoted properly. \\"Underneath\\" and \\"Shout It Out\\" are similar in that there are some memorable songs, but the rest of the songs are otherwise forgettable, mediocre, or catchy at best.      I know \\"Shout It Out\\" is obviously a pop album, but it's arguably more poppy (and more juvenile) than \\"Middle Of Nowhere.\\" It's an improvement compared to \\"The Walk\\" as it makes no consolation or secret of the fact that it's pop music. Despite the record's honesty,it still leaves something to be desired. There are some stand-out songs though: \\"These Walls\\" (though I liked the \\"Stand Up, Stand Up\\" EP version much better), \\"Voice In The Chorus\\" (despite being an acquired taste, I respect what they were trying to do with this song), \\"Use Me Up,\\" \\"Carry You There,\\" and \\"Me, Myself and I\\" (which is a slightly less inspired version of \\"A Song To Sing\\"). The horn section winds up making most of the songs sound like some half-fast 70s knock off. \\"Thinking 'bout Something\\" is okay, and it's probably the only song that merits the horns. \\"Make It Out Alive,\\" \\"Musical Ride,\\" \\"Kiss Me When You Come Home,\\" and \\"Waiting for This\\" are okay, but they qualify more as tollerable filler than anything else. \\"Make It Out Alive\\" could've done without the horn section.       \\"And I Wanted\\" and \\"Give A Little\\" are so cheesy that a) I don't believe guys in their mid to late 20s wrote these songs and b) they dont even deserve a spot on the album. They're the kind of songs that make me wonder what fan base Hanson is trying to target and if they want these new fans to take them at all seriously. I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided to release \\"Give A Little.\\" All in all, Hanson has shown me that their definition of the word \\"pop\\" is synonymous with derivative laughable crap. The album was apparently supposed to sound like \\"World's On Fire,\\" and I'm not quite sure where they lost sight of that. I understand what sound they were going for with \\"Shout It Out,\\" but for whatever reason, it wound up getting lost in translation by being taken that one step too far. They should leave their stiflingly rigid interpretation of bubblegum pop music for a band like \\"Tinted Windows.\\"        Between \\"Underneath,\\" \\"The Walk,\\" and \\"Shout It Out,\\" the good songs on each respective album can make for one decent album. If you're new to Hanson, start out with \\"TTA,\\" the \\"Middle of Nowhere Acoustic\\" re-recording from 2007, or \\"Underneath,\\" and work your way around from there. Try to fish around for some unreleased tunes and b-sides. These songs showcase Hanson's versatility; Hanson is at their best when they're not constricted by their own self-imposed constraints. Rather than conforming to the more cohessive stylings of a particular album's sound, their unreleased material really allows listeners to get a sense of Hanson's true potential and versatility.     I would've given this album a 2 and a half star rating if I could've. I wish the insightful Hanson would come back.. I don't need guys who are pushing 30 to bust around doing some gimmicky blues brothers pastiche. TTA was \\"no nonsense\\" pop-rock at its best, and they slowly started going downhill after that.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Jane Austen affected a sea change in the novel in the early 1800s. Before that time the novel was limited to rather farfetched adventure stories like Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. In the early 19th century, writing about everyday events was quite out of the ordinary, and Jane was the first to successfully portray the behind the scenes workings of the ladies and gentlemen of the English countryside.<br /><br />Watching a new adaptation of a Jane Austen novel is like seeing Shakespeare's Hamlet, there are no surprises in the final outcome. Rather the entertainment comes in the particular adaptation, actor's skills, and production qualities. Austen's Pride & Prejudice is one of her most popular novels, and each time it has found it's way onto the big screen and into DVD it's created a lot of passion for and against the adaptation.<br /><br />Universal's production has had a number of disappointed viewers as evidenced by many an online review. This disappointment typically seems to stem with having something to do with the casting decisions and the perceived lack of chemistry between the principal players. Conversely, some felt there was too much chemistry, or not enough propriety in the manner in which the Bennet's conducted themselves. Or that the Bennet's were incorrectly shown to be struggling financially and therefore didn't live or dress up to the idealized version of English gentility.<br /><br />To the chemistry of the actors, I believe the casting in Universal's version was excellent. Matthew Macfadyen perfectly portrayed the aloof, shy, yet emotionally caring Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley is a surprise in this role, for she is able to capture the strong-willed, hastily opinionated and yet free spirited Elizabeth Bennet quite well. But more importantly, this adaptation develops the full picture of the Bennet Family, with all five Bennet girls, with their individual personalities vying for the best dress, or introduction. Both Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet are superb in their timing, and comedic needling of one another. Judi Dench as the controlling Lady Catherine de Bourg, is pleasingly condescending wicked.<br /><br />Screenwriter Deborah Moggach portrayed the Bennet family in a very real and grounded environment. While she may have packaged Austen's novel in a less glamorous light than is typical; she was able to reflect the troubling circumstances people of that time had to deal with.  After all, the financial fix and worry of having five girls with no inheritance in 18th century England was the very point of view and experience that Jane wrote from.<br /><br />Between Director Wright and screenwriter Moggach, this version of Pride & Prejudice is deeply thought-provoking, and portrays the ups and down, moral questions, dilemmas, and hardships of being in society in the 18th century..

This is a movie that will pull you on your heart stings. I highly recommended this move to everyone.  The movie has several themes but the one that sticks out the most is the message of HOPE. It doesn't matter where you find yourself in life there is always hope for a better tomorrow. Don't take my word for it see it for yourself.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I was a little apprehensive to get this based on other reviews about the touch bezel feature. I find it frustrating too at times, but it is something that I can live with i guess. THe most frustrating part is getting back to the \\"workout view\\" once you accidentally move away from it during a workout. The bezel just goes completely gaga.    I followed another reviewers advice and lock th bezel during the workout, that way it doesnt bother me during my workout. The Heart rate feature is awesome. Garmin's web site is pretty easy to use. You can also export the data from the desktop app and upload to MapMyRun or MapMyRide web sites.    great product overall. Definitely needs a users manual though to figure out the whole bezel lock and unlock feature.
