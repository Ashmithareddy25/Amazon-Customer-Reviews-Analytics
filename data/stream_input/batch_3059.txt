B0053TMP24|5.0|Like any of Rick Riordions (sorry I spelt your name wrong) books it's just amazing.....that's all I have to say.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Overall an ok movie. The acting was nothing to write home about, but was not terrible either. The graphics were middle of the road as well. Where this movie really falls short is the story line.  Just like Oblivion, the Pacific Rim story line was taken straight out of the script from Independence Day and follows it to a T. Movies like Oblivion qnd Pacific Rim make me wonder if there is still anyone left in Hollywood that has any imagination left and is not content to just make new spins on stories and try to pass them off as new.
B00E193Y36|5.0|i love this music and the quality is perfect even the live performances in the second part is amazing. i usually hate hearing live music but this is amazing and it shows off the whole experience hearing other's who love them as much as me. the new music is the best i've ever heard from them and i love the live performances i feel like i'm really there. anyway great buy and definatly get it its a great price for the best music you'll ever hear.

B000I9U7C4|1.0|If you're like me, and I'm sure I'm not alone, and you can't get on Scorsese's wavelength, you're probably not going to like Taxi Driver either.  I wasn't hopeful but I decided to give Scorsese one last chance.  Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Taking out the Dead, all left me cold, bored and a little angry.  Taxi Driver was just as bad.  I've tried to understand why.  So many people absolutely love Scorscese movies that there must be something there.  In this case I'm blaming the score.  It calls attention to itself relentlessly.  It does not disappear behind the images and contribute to creating the mood and tone.  It stands between me and the images and seems to want to take me in a different direction, like it's incongruous with the film.  My ears were in a lounge listening to experimental jazz while my mind was watching an excellent character study with something to say about the nature of life.  I wonder if I could enjoy this movie with a different score, and I wonder if maybe that was my problem with the other movies as well?
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Another movie where ridiculous computer generated chase scenes trumps the story line.<br />Just a piece of garbage cashing in on the current zombie craze. I wish I could get my $3.99 back.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Such a disappointment. Felt that the characters fell flat and stopped developing, especially Tris. The storyline became boring and much too reliant on the idea of the different serums to control society. Felt that the storyline had too many holes in it to count not to mention that the ending just leaves you feeling flat. Cannot believe that the book was released like this- it felt unrefined, unfinished and repetitive.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read all of the Follett books and have loved them.  This one is no exception.  What makes it better is that this trilogy is so involved and so interesting.  You read some of the political struggles, battles, mistakes and victories and cannot help but compare it to today's issues.  The book brings our worlds history to life with great characters that evolve through the novel.  I cannot wait for Book Three!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Warm and filled with emotional attachment. The parallel stories of Molly and Vivian a complex and compassionate. What an ending!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love dogs. I love Enzo, and I over this heartwarming story of a man, his life, and his Dog. I have been recommending this book to everyone i know.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|The plot was predictable and felt very concocted, too thin for a good book but might make a decent movie. However, as a former 80's teenager, I did enjoy the walk down pop culture memory lane.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple, efficient, gets the job done. This is the calculator I use to do all my accounting coursework. Love the large numbers and the fact that it's not all colorful and weird neons.

B000RUAR5G|5.0|Awesome. Yes I love this movie. I was Lola bunny for Halloween. Awesome. Yay. Woo. Great. Love. This. Movie. Yup.
030758836X|4.0|From the beginning of the book, you will be sucked in and held there until the end. This is one of those books that you could stay up way too late to read more of or even finish.<br />I personally loved the frankness in Gillian's characters, as she had them either reveal their underlying thoughts or actually speak them out loud. Hold onto your hat, some of those thoughts are full of profanity and sex.<br />You will find that the title of the book has a double meaning. Without giving away the plot, GONE applies to multiple scenarios.<br />The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because of my own values of how relationships are sometimes better off dissolved rather than get into a battle of who can screw over the other person worse.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I bought these for my very opinionated and picky teenage daughter.  She loved them right off the bat and says the sound quality is much better than she had hoped for.  She has had them now for nearly a year with no problems and she uses them daily for hours.  She tends to be rough on this kind of thing and they are going strong and still look and perform as new.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't think I would like this game but I love it! It's probably good I only get five lives or I'd never stop playing.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I always associated Bingo with old people & elementary school kids!  But Bingo Blitz has given me a new outlook on the game.  It has mad playing Bingo exciting & colorful &all out fun again!!  I love th colorful graphics & -the wonderful powerups that help me to win SOMETHING at the end of a round, even if it's not a BINGO!!  Love this game!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's very easy and fun to play.  The puzzles are challenging &amp; fun to play.<br />I had so time to fill waiting at the doctor's office, but this kept me happily entertained instead.
B008XG1X18|4.0|There is truly something our there on Pinterest for any & every thing that one could imagine!  This is where I have found my entertainment news inspiration......great app!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game was fun and could be frustrating at times. It did feel like it was based off luck a lot of the time on where which pieces were placed where and whether you could beat the game from the lot you were given.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very addicting.  its not a typical running game and the quality is amazing.  have fun and ruuunnnnn
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A bit too much sex, would've liked more about the relationship. I enjoyed it though and in the beginning found myself unable to put it down. Think I might order the next book, curious what happens.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|its deff. a fun game.  it keeps freezing my kindle fire. im always having to restart  it. please fix for a better review.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|***spoiler alert****<br /><br />This book like the other books Veronica has written captures you from the beginning and you won't want to put it down however this book left me disappointed. It leads up to this big climax only to leave the readers disappointed and in shock. I'm not upset with who dies its just how they die. I figured Tris was going to die at the end just the way the book leads up to it but I feel she died in a way that's so cliche and disappointing. Also I'm disappointed how Uriah dies. You think in this futuristic world they would have a remedy for a coma and yet for the entire end of the book he's dead in a coma. Despite those two disappointments it was an easy read and entertaining to find out what's on the other side of the fence. Guess I just had high hopes for this book since the other two were so good.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|If you like games like battlefield and call of duty, you should definitely check out this game. This game is one of the best games I've ever played! This game does take up a lot of memory which might be a problem for some people.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|All the horrible things you ever imagined about North Korea's repressive government are true.  Although filled with metaphors and beautifully written, I simply could not shake the utter sorrow I felt after reading this book.  It is so depressing, one must read it in segments.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Waited to rate this until I had played it a while. I am not disappointed. I am enjoying the game so much more on the bigger screen. It works beautifully and I think it's worth the long wait for it to come to my Kindle Fire Thank you Amazon and King Games.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Great book that tells the story of the writer in concentration camps. Analyzes every aspect in detail but not in a way you will be that impressed about what happens but what the effects are. A must read for dealing with change.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|By now there have been so many zombie movies out it is hard to keep track of, but this is probably one of the best ones I have seen. Wife certified.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|I hate that things will pop up on my page that I didn't ask for, I like the communication amoungst friends.  Some of the information is very funny, some is very sad so you get a variety of emotions.  I love that you can find old friends and make new ones.  I WISH there was a way to identify a person under 18 so that there was a way to monitor who is talking to them, try to keep more and more grime down and keep our children safe.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It was a cinch to download and easy to use.  I have been able to upload 2 books so far and am enjoying my reading experience.
B008QOH1NG|3.0|I enjoyed this recording of Stryper live, but their interaction with the Indonesian crowd was strained. I believe most of those in attendance had little idea of the bands significance or the meaning of their lyrics. The 'sing-along' portions were really sad. The other live recordings of Stryper (such as the one in PR) are much more enjoyable.<br /><br />KeS<br />+++++++
B00BD99JMW|4.0|There are so many things I liked about this book. I loved the character Tris who is very brave. I also love Tobias. This is a great book up until the ending. I cried for over 40 minutes. Just putting that out there.
0937381888|5.0|This is a great book for beginners. I am using this book to guide me through my first home made batch of beer.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like this game.  But frustrated by the lives component. Why some few? What is the purpose of them? Would love to have a flow when a level is completed go to the next without  always having to wait for &quot;more lives&quot; to continue to play . Would be good to have tutorial or explanations about how lollipop, coconut, etc function in game play.  Great game
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Not bad for an action movie. great special effects. hokey as you would expect but fairly good editing so you have a minimum of &#34;huhs?&#34;
B005UG542S|5.0|It was so easy to go on amazon.com and find all of the items I wanted and had my purchases delivered to me within two days and loved the movie!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It has forecasts,maps,video,  easy to read large numbers, nice easy to read layout  and No ads.  far better than what I expected. Highly recommended.
B005FPT51K|3.0|I must say that overall I really like this monitor as I am away from home for work and it allows me to see the nursery from anywhere with internet access.  This was my main reason for picking this monitor.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of feedback/echoing when the audio is turned on and your close to the unit, as well as, the colour is very bland(almost night vision) even in full light conditions, which is unfortunate.  But for the price and access I think it's worth it overall.
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|Loads fine and will let you use the main menu but won't let you actually play the game. Tried to uninstall and reinstall no change-very disappointing the graphics until then were beautifull.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is just so so so so so so so awesome and its so worth paying for so I suggest that you get it
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Bought this for my husband, for Christmas;  He is slowly converting his records to CDs ... this is PERFECT!  It's awesome for my great aunt, as well!  She has tons of records that she wanted to listen to (again) but didn't have a record player,  translated them into CD's and now she can listen to those records she &#34;grew up on&#34; all over again!  Great sound quality, very easy to use!
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|I have seen better but I have seen worse. Parts of the film seemed to drag.With Amazon Prime, the price was right.
B009DT424Y|1.0|delay causes echo. returned. it does not work. not working. what can i say? could not use this equipment.<br />period.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Clearly made for devotees of Japanese monster movies - of which I am not one.  I thought it was going to be a SiFi movie- not so - more a poorly scripted, poorly acted fantasy.  Not worth the 4.99 I paid.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very simple setup. Good reception. Small yet very powerful .<br />Price is great. Control thru your device so easy.<br />It will be a must have to anyone who is into NETFLIX AND YOUTUBE.
006202406X|2.0|When I first discovered Divergent in summer 2013, I absolutely devoured it in under 24 hours. Thanks to Kindle magic, I grabbed Insurgent minutes later, likewise consuming it in two marathon reading sessions. I was hooked, and pre-ordered Allegiant on the spot. Several months later on release day, I downloaded Allegiant not long past midnight. It put me to sleep. Every time I'd start to read it, I just couldn't get into it.  I was baffled that an author whose work I couldn't put down I had become so meh about.<br /><br />And then it occurred to me--I was continually going back and forth to the chapter beginning to see who's POV I was reading again. Tris and Tobais are essentially characterized the same, and moreover, Tobias in Allegiant is nothing whatsoever like Four. The characters are just...flat.<br /><br />Add to that staid prose and a dull plot that employs Insane Troll Logic. It leaves you with a book where you can't really empathize with the cardboard characters, and a plot that leaves you saying, &#34;Yeah, whatever.&#34;  I can forgive crappy plots when I am engaged emotionally with the characters. Sadly, I was not.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of other reviewers complain about the ending. I feel that was actually the strongest writing of the book. The middle just felt like a lot of filler to get to that end point. I suspect even Roth was bored for most of the book. It was when she let go of the convention of Chapter 1 Tris, Chapter 2 Tobias, Chapter 3 Tris...and just let the narrative flow from a single viewpoint for a while, that the prose was more compelling. It begs the question, is this a story that Roth WANTED to tell, or was it a novel Roth's publisher PUSHED her to tell because Trilogy=Box Office Capital? God forbid somebody in Hollywood tries to turn Allegiant into Parts 1 and 2 because there's barely enough compelling content there for a single story.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Oria, just turning eighteen, a member of the Ahwahnecchees tribe, and brought up by her grandmother, has long been used to hearing tales of the customs and legends of her tribe. The strange dreams she has had have long hinted of her powers and predestined future as a Golden Queen Fairy, which her grandmother has prepared her for. She assumes and evolves more and more powers, such as mind-reading, shape-shifting, a healing touch, telekinetic and magical powers, let alone being able to control the weather. But she discovers that her ultimate destiny and role is to combat the forces of evil in their attempt to take over the world. This brilliantly-crafted book, alternating between, on the one hand, thrills and wonder, and, on the other, a realistic and authentic portrayal of a young girl's battle to accommodate herself to the role thrust upon her, builds up to a rousing finale of thunderbolts and catacylsmic events in the cosmic struggle against evil. And, within such momentous matters, we also follow Oria's journey towards discovering and understanding the true nature of love, in her relationship with Grey Wolf. Don't miss out on this story!

B00ER23UYA|3.0|If you were a huge fan of \\"Bible Belt\\" like I was, you will probably be a little disappointed with Diane's highly anticipated sophomore album  \\"Speak a Little Louder.\\"<br /><br />Tinges, but mostly gone are the R&B and Gospel roots that channeled Laura Nyro and Carole King of the late 60's/early 70'. They are replaced with a more orchestrated sound reminiscent of 80's Stevie Nicks and Kate Bush.<br /><br />Just like her prior EP \\"The Velveteen Age\\" containing covers of 80's music pioneers, The Cure, Siouxie & the Banshees, Echo & the Bunnymen... Diane seems to be expanding on a similar theme, but with less success as before. Usually most sophomore efforts are a continuation of an artist's prior album to keep new fans happy. However, Diane has chosen to move forward with a different sound that is usually reserved for 3rd album releases.<br /><br />That is not to say \\"Speak a Little Louder\\" is without merit. Diane does sounds as great as usual, with some solid writing/production skills on half the songs like \\"Tell Me Tomorrow\\", \\"Pretty in Pain\\", \\"UNFKD\\", \\"Hold On a Little Longer\\", and \\"Truer Than Blue\\". Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the other half, probably due to too high an expectation considering ALL of \\"Bible Belt\\" was fantastic. However, if you loved her previous \\"The Velveteen Age - EP\\" you will probably love this album as well.<br /><br />Still being a huge fan of Diane, seeing her live in concert, on a couple of solo StageIt shows online, and a great turn on Live at Daryl's House... her next release will be key on what direction she will be moving toward as an artist. Only time will tell... but hopefully she will revert to a combination of both that will make everyone happy.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The Fault In Our Stars is a touching story about 16 year old Hazel Grace, stricken with cancer, and the friends she makes in her support group. As one group member, Gus, begins to draw her attention to him, and Hazel finds herself wanting to spend more time with this boy, who is in remission after his own battle with cancer. The two begin to spend time together and eventually come to realize they have fallen in love.<br /><br />As the story unravels, readers follow Hazel and Gus through adventures that take them everywhere from the local gas station to a quaint hotel in Amsterdam. Through these adventures, Hazel and Gus bond over their mutual struggles with cancer, his in the past and hers in the present.<br /><br />As the young couple becomes increasingly closer, things start to unravel for one of them. The gripping conclusion of this story strongly speaks to the power of young love and the struggle that each of us faces against time.<br /><br />The characters in The Fault In Our Stars all play an important role in the story, and each character is someone that at least one reader can relate to. The powerful message this book sends is that while love may not conquer all, it can make a huge difference in quality of life and the way in which people appreciate life in general.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is so much fun. It's exercise for the brain. It's addicting I couldn't stop until I completed it. Where can I find more of these games? I want to do more.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|One of the reasons I bought Oblivion, which I had already seen when it came out on Red Box, was the M83 isolated score. So after watching the movie I enable the isolated score and after a few seconds it makes a noise and disappears, and the receiver is showing that is not receiving any signal. Then it comes back, but it goes away after a few seconds, and as far as I can tell, it's like that throughout the disc.<br /><br />I don't have a cheap Walmart $30 player, I have a Sony BDP-S5100 that has no problem with any other disc. Evidently whoever authored this disc didn't do a minimum of quality control. It doesn't seem to me like the disc itself has a manufacturing problem, or I would have had problems playing the movie itself.<br /><br />This is pathetic, how can Paramount release a Blu-ray where it promises a bonus feature that it doesn't deliver? Especially ruin what is an otherwise flawless movie.
B008JFUPZI|1.0|Saying that RIPD is one of the worst theatrically released films I've seen this year doesn't really say much since I avoided seeing all the ones that looked truly, unbearable horrendous (ex. Grown Ups 2, After Earth, The Hangover Part III, Epic). I'll be the first to admit that when I saw the trailer, I thought the film didn't look good; the CGI looked atrocious, Ryan Reynolds just looked like he was playing Ryan Reynolds, and there was also the fact that it essentially had the exact same plot as Men in Black (And I am the millionth person to make that comparison, too). It didn't look good, but man, it looked like fun. There are plenty of obviously bad movies that are fun and entertaining, and I thought this was one of them.<br /><br />No, it's just a generic, bad movie. While I can think of other bad films I saw this year that technically were more flawed in terms of story-telling, they were still sort of \\"interestingly\\" bad; like the kind of bad movie that I can list and explain in detail why certain things about the plot did, and did not work. This film... it's just generically bad. It's completely predictable, full of cliches (Such as the cop main character being betrayed by his partner who turns out to be the big bad, or one of the big bads) that are handled exactly as you expect them to, never does anything new or intriguing that makes this universe different than any other universe with ghosts and dead people, and never evolves or becomes anything more than \\"Men in Black with ghosts\\".<br /><br />The only enjoyable part in the film is Jeff Bridges, and granted, he was fun, but one character can't save a whole movie. All of the best parts, all of the best jokes are in the trailers (And honestly, the trailer was funnier than the film).<br /><br />I'm probably harsher on the film than I should be, since it wasn't annoying or insulting to my intelligence; and honestly, I don't hate it. I was just disappointed in how joyless the whole movie was. It was bland, boring, and predictable; there's really nothing else I can say about this film.<br /><br />Even if you somehow manage to get this movie for free, it would still be a waste of your time. Use that 90 minutes for a better movie.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is funny and great but for kindle fire users READ THIS. In the settings of the main menu if game you can actually turn off &quot;Plane Game&quot; for devices that wont allow you  to blow on the screen, like the kindle fire.

140006922X|1.0|Resa Aslan, who boasts \\"he divorced but still loves'' Jesus, was born a Muslim in Iran, flirted with evangelical Christianity as a teen, then returned to his Muslim faith. Aslan writes like a divorced person reviewing a soured romance, pounding on what he perceives are weaknesses and glossing over and ignoring the good (the Eucharist/Last Supper, the rallying point of the church Jesus founded and a key moment in his life, is barely mentioned or even understood). The book is subtitled \\"The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,'' but the book is overwhelmingly about the decades before and after Jesus - with very little about the man himself except constant doubts about Jesus' entire life story and all the sainted people who surrounded him.<br />Aslan cites unprovable theories long ago discredited (challenging the existence of Joseph, insisting Jesus must have been married with children while acknowledging there is exactly no evidence he had a wife or children). He repeatedly asserts Jesus was a violent revolutionary based on a single quote referencing swords while dismissing mounds of evidence that Jesus used peaceful tactics to revolutionize the world.<br />The best argument for reading this book is that it's well-written and tells a good story, humanizing the world before and after Jesus. For an atheist or non-Christian, it might offer a good entry point to see how non-believers see Jesus, the man. The problem is there are so many factual errors (he keeps calling the land Palestine when it wasn't called that during that era) and examples of bias that you have to constantly wonder how much can be trusted and how much is merely an interesting story. Nonetheless, I read the whole book because it's a good summary of how a non-believer with a Muslim bias views the man who changed the world more than anyone before on since.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book reminds me of the three women from neverwhere, another of his books, I thoroughly enjoyed it! . I would recommend this to everyone!!!!

B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The story was good continuance of the Shining Saga, but you never got the impression that the heroes would prevail. I would like to see a third story  continuing the saga of Abra and Dan.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|I usually find Bryson a bit repetitive and tedious, but I read an excerpt and decided to give this book a chance. I was pleasantly surprised. Bryson does a great job of taking familiar events and expanding on them and connecting them to current trends. The research was top notch, and the story flowed. As a trivia fan, it as fun to get the details often left out of historical accounts and documentaries. I even had visions of a Ken Burns style narrative as I was reading the book.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This app pretty much goes the distance in clearing memory space and maintaining RAM in a manner of sustaining the desired speed component of my Kindle Fire HD tablet device.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|Much of this album harkens back to Elton's best in his Paul Buckmaster period. His incredible use of lyrics and terrific talent at filling out a melody with chord depth, are only matched by his terrific voice, which simply grows with age. The man still has a lot to give us, and this album proves it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I really like the game especially how its starts and u have to work ur way to the top its cool
B00E7RZEI0|3.0|The game progresses in it's complexity well, not redundant, but the game only has so much to give.  3 stars.
B001HM1PFO|3.0|I TOTALLY FORGOT IT WAS A MUSICAL ,ADUL COMEDY, GENDER/TRANSVETITE ! COMEDY ,HOAX ,AND MANY OTHER THOUGHTS, FARCEICAL ,AND NOT SO MUCH HORROR ! OKAY FOR SOME LAUGHS !

B002KLOPF8|5.0|Who cares what happens after the boot camp scenes? The drill instructor makes the movie. The rest of the movie is okay at best.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is great! It does confuse the motion to turn for the motion to jump occasionally but it's still great...and addictive!
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|I really liked this movie. The people in it were good. It had some unrealistic stuff but it was good overall.
B005UT29Z0|2.0|This movie is so boring!!!! It ends stupidly as well as the storyline is somewhat mundane and monotonous!!In a situation as that NO ONE stays that calm. Good actors very poor script but hey I give E for effort!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Fantastic game definitely the best game i have.  However it is missing linking to facebook and or google plus.  Adding that and the ability to play against your facebook friends would be huge.  As well as the option to remove time outs.  Great job though!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because you get to do a Buchanan of stuff on it and I love dispicable me movie
B002KV4NTQ|5.0|This is a classic album. I had it when it was vinyl. The Rolling Stones are a class act all the way around.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun and addicting.  This game could use more in the tutorial section on using special candies and strategies.  I do not like the wait time if you fail to complete a level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad CC made it for Kindle users. This is one of my favorite games and very addictive. Kindle continues to be my go to device for everything.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I felt some of the words for body parts could have been a little less harsh.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Unless you've been living under a rock lately, you know how addictive the game is, it's plain simple and fun!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Some of the levels are hard but it could just be me. My ( grown) daughter is acing it. She is really good at games
B00BU1DG1S|5.0|Extremely interesting and original plot, characters and setting. I highly recommend to anyone who has even a passing interest in science fiction.
0547848412|1.0|Very hard to get interested in this boring tale.  Probably will never finish reading it.  Totally boring .. or perhaps I am missing something.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I enjoyed this book,  I felt it was well written, and very different.  One of those books that you hate for it to end.
B005FHXB0O|4.0|Fun flick.  Plenty of action and violence to keep folks entertained.  Good plot twists to keep the thinking people interested.<br /><br />The 'Trailer Scene with the Sicilian' is one of the best on film.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I was excited to read another book by Khaled Hosseini, but I never finished this one.  It jumped around so much that everytime I picked it up to read it,  I felt like I started a new book, with new characters.  I was totally lost.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Am so happy that you have added Candy Crush! Was ready to get an IPod just so I could play my favorite game - THANKS!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good read. Good character building. Nice flow. Great story telling. Must read John Grisham fans. Equal to last book, enjoy.
B000FBJF2I|4.0|Enjoyed developing plot of who-dunnit.  Easy read and like challenge of figuring it out early-only got half of it right :-(.  :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy with this app! So glad kindle finally got candy crush!! I would recommend this app for all ages!!
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|it is fun and entertaining its perfect for halloween I like how  the levels are all different its a good thinking game.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I am the sort of fellow that likes action and stories that move along fast.  Therefore Mud was a slow for me most of the movie.  I did think the ending made the wait more than worth it.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|its perfect for if you have  young children. if you do get the app listen to the song its sooo catchy. its woo cool cud it teaches you what life is like and how to save your life. it is one of the best games ever solo worth the space on the kindle. I COMPLETLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!! get it.trust me I usually don't like a lot of games but this ROCKS!!!!!!!!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I watched this with my 9 year old granddaughter.  We both enjoyed it!  I have watched over 30 movies with her.  Thank God she is graduating from pure animation.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|If you like uno this game is for you. It has great graphics and it loads fast. It is just like sitting around the table playing with friends.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Hey, I'm 61 - I love it when the older generation gets one over on the younger generation.  This movie wonderfully displays the old adage &#34;Age and treachery will always defeat youth and zeal.&#34;  The movie makes me excited to be R.E.D.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Just cool and it is good for me to play free time. Prime is.good enough to watch movie in free time
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Excellent King, as always, but was missing the scary edge his classics offer.  Danny makes an interesting and empathetic character.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I have seen Korn in concert several times and never get tired of hearing their music. Now that all the members of the band are back together again, this new release of music reflects the tightness and cohesiveness of the band.  The tracs are tight and well recorded. Jonathan Davis is truly one of the premier vocalists of his time.  He knows how to excite the crowd when in concert  and his piercing vocals are truly evident on this disc.  The new material  is a welcome addition to my Korn musical collection.
0744014549|5.0|This artbook is really good I'd recommend it to anyone who like the Tomb Raider series, or anyone who just likes art. It features the characters (both heroes and villains) and most of the the book is landscapes which are freakin' beautiful, and they'd be ideal to have as portraits to have around your abode. By the way I got this book when it was only 26$ on Amazon haha.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|This game is fun to play, once you learn the rules and how to manipulate the blocks. This is one of my top 5 gaming apps!
B003LQMZS0|4.0|I got this for a baby for christmas so I hope the baby boy like it for a christmas present.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This album truly has something that will appeal to everyone. I have heard so many people reference this song - even last night I heard Michael Buble do a cover! Great work by great artists.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|After downloading this FREE game, I was very impressed with the quality of the graphics.  I have never played a game such as this and asked my husband, the engineer, for help.  He normally doesn't play games, but WE played the first game for 2 1/2 hours!  I'm hooked!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I play some of these tunes while I am reading books on my kindle. There are so many different combinations, and I have created a few &#34;tracks&#34; that I really enjoy. 2 thumbs up!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This was a great series. Suspenseful and interesting! Really enjoyed reading them. Hope there is another series coming by dashner!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I loved this remake of Star Trek, and can't wait for the next movie to be released. The cast was well chosen and the adaptation of the original story line was interesting and engaging. I was always wondering what was going to happen next! Cumberbach could have put on a little weight to be a more menacing Khan, but he did a great job.
0061950726|4.0|The central story of \\"Orphan Train\\" follows an orphaned Irish immigrant \\"rescued from a life of depravity\\" in New York City by do-gooders and sent to live at age 9 with a series of mid-west farming families on the eve of the Depression. This story is based on historical facts and is fascinating, evocative, and well told.<br /><br />  I wish Kline had been satisfied just to tell this story, but she apparently wanted to bolster its appeal by adding more immediate relevance, and so frames it within a second story sent in 2011 about an orphaned Native American girl sent to live with a foster family.  The parallel is heavy-handed, there is an obligatory love interest which feels forced, and  the ending feels contrived.<br /><br />  Still, the book is a good fast read, suitable for teen-agers, although the presence of an author interview and a Reading Group Guide suggests the author was aiming for the Book Club crowd
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is very straight forward to use, and even though I don't tweet that much, I use it to keep track of where my favorite Food Trucks are! Good design, twitter!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Beautiful unique mix of sounds.  Piano Guy's talent is amazing!  I listen to this CD on my way work but it would be great to just turn on at home as well.
B0061S0A64|2.0|This is cool to play around with, but for me, there was just not enough going on to keep me interested. It would be cool if I could add my own mp3's to this app to play around with.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After the first two books, I was expecting so much more for this book.  I kind of regret even reading it.  The two point of views between Tris and Tobias were too similar and it was often jarring when I didn't realize right away that it was the other's view.  As for the ending, it seemed to just be a shock factor and didn't meaningfully add to the book.<br /><br />If Veronica Roth decided to try again at writing this book, I would fully support her and pretend that this one never happened.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love this app because it includes text-based articles and the audio portions as well. I use this app to catch up on the latest world events throughout the day. It is easy to navigate and generally well-designed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game....!!!!!!! I also love . It because it on . Kindle fire and it make . It easier for me to . Play
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush on Kindle Fire is awesome.  It's just like the Facebook game but better.  You cam also access your mail randomly without losing your sent extra lives.  YAY!!  I love it.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|HD/Amazon Instant Video rental review: The quality was great---no skipping, blurring, or sync problems.  When you get quality like this and have an HDTV, this is the best way to enjoy a movie.<br /><br />Now the movie review:<br /><br />I loved it.  I am by no means a die-hard Star Trek fan. In fact, my first real entry into the universe was through the 2009 film, which I thought was a good start to a new franchise of movies.<br /><br />Into Darkness was even better, because without having to spend time on character backstories, they were able to jump right into the story.  There were several interesting twists that I did not see coming.  While all of the cast is good, I was most impressed with Benedict Cumberbatch.  He easily conveys the physical strength and mental prowess of Khan.  I was also happy to see that several supporting characters (Ahura, Scott, and Bones) got their own mini stories rather than just supporting the Kirk/Spock story.<br /><br />Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that it has heart.  As a fan of Fringe, Lost, Super 8 and other Bad Robot projects, one of the things that stand out about these projects is that they tend to tell very good character stories where friendship and camaraderie are central.  Into Darkness is no exception.<br /><br />The movie looks stunning.  There are various environments represented and each looks completely unique and surreal.<br /><br />If you like a good action/adventure film with great visuals and heart, I highly recommend this.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is a great CD by Depeche Mode. It was my first introductory CD to this band. I like their music, it certainly has a special mood and feeling to the music. I highly recommend if for old and new fans. Enjoy!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Of Captain America, The Avengers, and Thor (the only films in the Marvel film universe that I have seen so far), Thor is my favorite. Chris Hemsworth is fantastic as the title character. He does a great job portraying the arrogant young man who gives his father no other option but to teach him a hard lesson, the fish out of water mortal. and the superhero.  He has very good chemistry with everyone he shares a scene with, but especially the adorable Natalie Portman (at her most likable in this film).  If I have one complaint, I would love to have seen more scenes on Asgard and the backstory of Thor and his friends.  The film does a great job balancing fantastic visuals and action with humor and a bit of romance.  Definitely looking forward to the sequel.
B000002I2I|5.0|This is an excellent Doors CD. Some good rock, great lyrics, and great sound. I highly recommend it for old and new fans! Enjoy!
B00004XQ83|4.0|Oh brother, where art thou is the soundtrack from the movie by the same name. It is nice with all the old songs and the different versions of I am a a man of constant sorrow.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I was expecting a condensed book which would portray the rise and fall of Nikola Tesla. But what I found was indeed much more than that. For the first 20 odd pages, the author was discussing about a totally different topic whose relevance I understood once I completed the book.<br /><br />The book is concise, focusing on the important events in Tesla's life which shaped him as one of the very few visionaries who sculpted the modern age, ages before they materialized - and all of this with imagination. As the book puts, without imagination, our human species would still be in the caves.<br /><br />Read this book and share it with your friends - you will definitely be appreciated by those who can grasp what it tries to convey!
B000002J5K|4.0|I like the Blues Brothers soundtrack recording. However, I was disappointed that John Lee Hooker's song was not included. That was the one of the songs I was really looking forward to. It was nice to see that Minnie the Moocher with Cab Calloway was included though. Still enjoy the music...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the app. The option to just hold the picture and it brings up all your boards is fantastic.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|Very good cd. All the songs are great and will put you in an upbeat mood!  If you like maroon 5 this cd is a must!!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really love this app. This app is helping me learn how to read, speak, and write in Spanish :) It also has other languages that you can learn  as well.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic book of heroism and valor. Impossible not to be even more grateful for the men and women who fight for our country after reading this book.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This season, the show has become even grittier than last season, there's always something else going on or about to happen and you never  know until it does. I wish I can try out for the show and become a regular, that's how good the script seems to be an  the story within it. Great Job with the new season!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is an enjoyable for anyone in the family to play,  You Get started and hate to put it down
1451624468|5.0|Krauss is becoming my Dawkins for Evolution of the Universe. He elaborates with ease and charm, with a certain twist of humor every now and then. Loved it.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|I suggest that you read the books in order. This one especially, in order to get the references to previous actions laced throughout.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|To begin, the package arrived absurdly fast, and I wasn't even using Prime. It arrived right on time, along with a multitude of other items I'd ordered. I'd been looking forward to finally seeing the third of Nolan's Batman movies. To be honest, I think this one was my favorite. I really enjoyed it, and I highly recommend it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great book. Very logical insight into a much under appreciated topic. A must read for those wanting to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their life
B00BFINHHE|2.0|It was a metalpak I ordered a steelbook it even says Mission: Impossible Limited Edition STEELBOOK (Region Free)<br />The Movie is great popcorn fun but it not what wanted. Anyway the shipping was really fast it came 2 days after I ordered it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I do play and it is all ways cool to get the same dragon not on peeler . It is really
B004MWLXH6|4.0|This A Great Film With A Amazing Cast Pretty Good Price But Its Not Something To Mind JUST BUY IT.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I had my doubts when starting to watch episode 1, but following that I quickly watched the remaining 9 episodes in quick order.  Outstanding in every way: great story, great characterizations, great acting and execution.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see this in the Appstore! This is the most addicting game ever! You have to at least try this app. I can't put it down! (Until I run out of lives lol!)
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|It was nice to pick these up in one package at great price it was fast delivery and film quality excellent, I recommend watching these first then see the new Star Trek movies
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Another great book by Rick Riordan. I fell in love with Percy Jackson and right now I'm almost done with House of Hades. This book was also amazing. I can't wait to finish the series and House of Hades and for the last book in the Heroes of Olympus series.
0767919408|5.0|He is able to weave an amazing tale of facts.  HIstory come to life, with his wonderful wit.  I wonder what he is writing next!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A wonderful, compelling story.  Seth was so ornery and nasty, but managed to do right eventually.  Lettie managed to come out of the shadows and win, although she certainly wasn't perfect.... Jest a simple black.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|Downloaded it as free app of the day but had no change to play it. It reboots my tablet every I try to start the app. This is the first app I installed that does that. Until then I didn't even know android apps could crash the system completely.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Dan Browns &#34;The Lost Symbol&#34; is truly a book that grips you. From the word go I felt myself engulfed by how thrilling, fascinating and clever this book was. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and most definitely did not even have hint at what the twists tails turned out to be. As always I love the historical background that is provided as it makes the book come to life. I myself am fascinated by history and so all of Dan Browns book provide a magnificent fictional story set in a historically correct and adept background.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|lots of fun to play and very good exercise for the brain. Excellent way to pass the time and unwind.
B00006J9OV|4.0|Musically this performance is hard to beat. Although the Amfortas character does not do a good job facilitating the listener's compassion, every other character vocally performs with excellence. Also, the characters do a lot to visually complement the vocal lines.<br /><br />A high-definition recording would have been an excellent choice, although this performance may have not been recorded with that standard.
0316228532|1.0|I wanted to commit suicide while reading, and after reading this book.  I expected better prose.  Want my copy?  I'll send it to you.  I can't give it away.
1476727651|5.0|Personally, I think when Stephen King takes on paranormal topics (Carrie, Firestarter, The Shining, and now Dr. Sleep), he just &#34;gets it.&#34;<br /><br />In this latest effort, he uses his typical ability to weave a gripping story, with engaging characters, and leaves you with a book that's hard to put down.<br />If you're a King fan, this one's definitely for you...if you've not experienced him before (maybe try starting with The Eyes of the Dragon), it's still damn good!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was an absolute page turner! It kept me up all night. The ending blew me away. I would recommend this to anyone with children--especially a son.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game.  Game is good for all ages and keeps you entertained.  I am typing this for the game about to keep playing.
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|Fast shipping. Fun cd. But the case it's very thin, like when you buy a single... don't like that.. but fast shipping and fun cd works for me.
0385351399|5.0|Superlative prose and addicting narrative. Fascinating and horrifying look into tech-driven present, or future (...). Though 'Silicon Valley,' management & groupthink could apply to any large organization. An outstanding, and perspicacious (DOOM), read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Everyone talks about this game; so once I saw it on kindle, i decided to give it a try. The only thing I don't like is that you get into one of the levels and it asks you to make a purchase in order to finish the level.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Should be mandatory reading in junior high school or high school. Dispels common media created conceptions of this period in US history.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Surprisingly good.  Laugh out loud funny.  And I really enjoyed the behind the scenes stories from snl. Shucks dachshunds husbands.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I only wish the next installment of the series were published.<br /><br />This book is amazing. What else is there to say?
0062073508|5.0|This book was summer reading for my 7th (going into 8th) grade son. I hadn't read an Agatha Christie book in a long, long time and I had never read this one so I couldn't resist!<br /><br />Classic Agatha Christie -- You won't know who did it until the end (when the detective figures it out and spells it out for you:) But you will have fun getting to know all the &#34;suspects&#34; along the way!<br /><br />A man is murdered in the middle of the night on the train, and there are 12 suspects. The dilemma: all of the suspects have alibis, and none of them seems like the murdering kind. On the other hand, the man who was murdered had done horrible things and was evil through and through. There were a number of reasons why a number of people would want him dead... so who did it?
0142196940|5.0|Fantastic memoir. It's a must for every fan.  The book was well written and allows you to experience the Duran Duran phenomenon from onstage.
B007EECSFA|5.0|kate morton's excellent writing style keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.  as the tale twists and turns, the mystery deepens.  the ending is an astonishment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is lots of fun, but highly addictive.<br /><br />Some levels are very easy while others create a real challenge and might take days to complete. All in all, it is an amazing experience.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|At first I was having some problems, but after spending  more time<br /> being patient and concentrating on the picture the game got easier and easier,and more and more fun.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What a disappointing ending.  This part of my review is sort of spoiler-ish relating to the outside of the fence.<br /><br />Isn't it bad enough that the city itself was in disarray?  Chaos and rebels along with a tyrant running the city.  Things were bad.  Then they ventured outside the fence where, guess what?  It was more orderly but still there were rebels, people wanted to rise up and fight the government.  Wasn't it already bad enough in the city?<br /><br />Now on the SUPER SPOILER section of my review.  Yea be warned...  Don't read it if you don't want to know!!<br /><br />First and foremost, what an utter disappointment to kill Tris!  This character has struggled to overcome many obstacles and has grown (realizing she wanted to live). she finally came to a good place with Tobias and them BAM!  You killed her?  I'm all for a writer being bold but this made me feel like I just wasted my time reading the whole story from the beginning.  It felt cheap.<br /><br />Plus Tobias's mother just doing a 180 and saying OK, I'll end this revolt because my son gave me an ultimatum.  She was an extremist that wholeheartedly believed she was doing the right thing!  She even cut her son out of meetings and plans because she couldn't trust him or didn't think he was on board one hundred percent.<br /><br />And lets not overlook the fact that the memory wipe they did at the bureau would only effect that city.  You're not starting from the top down.  Only that city would be better for the &#34;GD's&#34; until the government came in and got them back on track.  That story may have had time to work out if it wasn't rushed and smashed into the last book.  It took two books overthrow the faction system in the city.<br /><br />I think there could have been a much better scenario for the &#34;beyond the fence&#34; world.  And the knife twist at the end?  Peter (who is a terrible and evil person) wanted to have his memories taken and then started showing the same symptoms as before.  No way!  Peter was narcissistic and selfish but he got to live????  I don't really believe he would want redemption by wiping his memories at that point.<br /><br />I am severely disappointed with the last book, I hope if the movies are successful that the third one gets a serious re-write!No way!  Peter was narcissistic and selfish but he got to live????  I don't really believe he would want redemption by wiping his memories at that point.<br /><br />I am severely disappointed with the last book, I hope if the movies are successful that the third one gets a serious re-write!
B00FQAZ7PW|3.0|I was really looking forward to this album hoping that Pearl Jam would re-discover some of that raw energy that made them one of the best bands of the early 90's. Overall the album is not a bad one, but it fits right within the mold of 'Pearl Jam' and 'Backspacer'. There are some good songs on here, in particular the blues tinged 'Let the Records Play' was excellent and a nice little change of pace in the second half of the album. However it seems that in trying to capture some of the raw energy of those early blockbuster songs such as Alive and Jeremy they have settled on just playing fast songs such as 'Mind your Manners' which are interesting, but tend to sound the same and are more or less uninspiring.<br /><br />In a word, good, worth a listen and definitely for the fans of Pearl Jam's post 2000 efforts, but if you fell in love with this band at the start of the 90's like me it probably won't rock your boat.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is awesome. Challenging, but not impossible. Graphics are fantastic also. If you like puzzle games then this is for you!
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|This was a total waste of time and $5.  The previous would have sufficed to complete the movie as the ending seemed like they made it up as they went along.  Don't waste your time.  The cast was pretty good but the entire script was worthless.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It gives you challenges but fun to play. I would tell anyone if they were thinking about getting a game pick this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing candy crush on my lap top for a while and love the fact that I can play on my kindle but I can not access the extra moves that friends give you in the game.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|when i got the app my battery life went down 40% faster. downloads pretty well though. i kind of reconmend it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good game, lots of fun when you got some time to blow.  The challenge of some levels is a bit frustrating.  Keeps you coming back for more.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this gameeeeee<br />its so much fun<br />so happy its availible for kindle fire now<br />maybe we can get some other apps 2
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|When the car of &#34;mismatched toys&#34; comes through the tunnel with Charlie standing in full embrace of the city, every nerve reaches out to that young part of us all.  It is a great movie of multiple scenes remembering the freedom of the outcast.  During the dance, our group breaks out in exuberant and loving mad movement.  Who could wish but to be a young woman  ( or man) flinging her arms to the sky in pure ecstasy?  This movie perhaps, well more than perhaps, glorifies an often dreary place of the wallflower in his own creation of a world.  But it is a great glorification and well worth the hyperbole.<br /><br />The handling of the mental illnesses and the grittier sides of these young peoples' lives is done lightly and with great skill.  I would recommend you enjoy this movie, no matter how old you are.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Background.  Have not read the original book.  Saw the Redford version, but so many years ago, its a blur, though a beautiful blur.<br />  At first found the 3D effects a bit \\"contrived\\" in the first 5 minutes or so....but finally, I just let the lush and evocative imagery draw me in, like a beautiful wave on a hot Mexican beach and I began to truly enjoy it without holding back due to its unusual style.<br />  Perhaps only 3D could do such a story proud. I suspect F. Scott Fitzgerald would love this version.<br />  (Wouldn't it be interesting to see this director (Baz Luhrmann), pull off Romeo and Juliet in 3D....and watch Shakespeare react to his interpretation?)Oops...I found out this director did do a version of Romeo and Juliet, but don't know if its 3D.  (Somehow, I doubt it).<br />  I suspect he'd say: \\"Yummy!  Truly brilliant and delicious and decadent and visually sumptuous.\\"<br />Ever since I saw Leonardo DiCaprio in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\"  when a child star, I have found him captivating.<br />I don't believe he's ever won an Oscar.  (I am totally clueless as to why, unless the other stars just won't vote for him.  I feel he simply reeks talent).<br />  The fight scene in that hot hotel room was as real as if it had happened in my own living room: Thundering.  In your face;  and ripped from the core of his soul.<br />  I thought Carey Mulligan who played Daisy was good, but I do prefer Mia Farrow better in the earlier version.<br />Still, she was  gorgeous and believable in this  role.<br />  Artistically, the sets,  costumes,  cars,  cityscapes,  houses, were spectacular and worth the price of admission in and of themselves.  It seems no penny was spared to bring an \\"over the top\\" non stop fiesta to life.  All bit actors did splendidly.<br />  Tobey Maguire did a wonderful job too. I felt he was almost as good in this as he was in \\"Cider House Rules\\".<br />His character was not as fully developed by the screenwriter, but his acting was brilliant.<br />  Having seen this version, I now want to re-watch the older Gatsby film again.  I know that each will stand on its merits.  Each was created using the technology and talents of the artists and visionaries of their time.  (I often hate \\"remakes\\" but this is one that was worth doing.)  The message burns strongly  and the visual impact in certain ways has more power than even Avatar did with the 3-D effects.  That is because in Avatar everything is fantasy, whereas this is more true to life.<br />  I am not the kind of person who generally watches a movie again and again.  This will be an exception.<br />I am really glad we purchased the 3-D version and can easily do that whenever we feel the need.<br />  One of the reasons people go to the movies is to escape their own lives.<br />  The Great Gatsby, and I mean THIS particular Leonardo DiCaprio version is that perfect getaway.<br />Pass the Champagne!r />  Having seen this version, I now want to re-watch the older Gatsby film again.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|Classic Rollins - great characters doing crazy things and saving the world while they're at it!  An enjoyable read, fast paced and highly entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the intertwining of physics and fun. Read it. It's awesome.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Okay, it isn't perfect. I've read / watched the reviews that point out the numerous errors and plot oddities, and I understand where those reviewers are coming from. But the fact of the matter is I've seen this movie 4 times now, and I've never failed to enjoy it. I think it's a fun take on an oft-wondered theme, and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B001NLKSI4|5.0|If you are into finance or the stock market or just plain like good stories then you'll probably like this. I find the story quite interesting and enjoy the raw reality of the finance world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is great! My husband and I are addicted to this game. We love to see how good we are doing, compared to our friends.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Really good and the game is free so it is a win win situation. This game has nice graphics but it can be slow
B004LUS390|5.0|This app is very simple to use, yet has a lot of professional functions. This is definitely along the lines of a Photoshop lite (plus a little more). The app is so intuitive to use that my 10 yr old niece just picked it up and started using it. I can not rave enough about how cool, amazing and functional this app is. LOVE IT!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. Loved Myst and Riven and found the puzzles similar. Lot of thinking but not so awful hard you want to give up. Highly recommend this game if you want a challenge.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I became grumpy reading this book.  There is so much disfunction in modern life, I do not need to add to it by reading about two engaging but definitely dysfunctional characters.
B00E6F155E|5.0|This was a great show at his creative peak.  The songs are great, the performance is probably not his very best but any Peter Gabriel show outshines just about anybody else.  You will enjoy this concert!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|It is a Xmas gift for  my Daughter  she loves  the Beetles Paul is her favorite she has all their records and CDS and pictures on the wall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is amazing!! I'm in awe of the graphics, and can't wait to swipe two stripped candies or a sprinkled donut and stripped candy together. However, I don't like the delay in depot train stations with the three quests occurring over 72 hrs/  one quest/ day policy. Personally I would love to see what my neurotransmitters are doing while playing this game. Anyone out there interested in this research aspect of Candy Crush??
B00G32OER4|5.0|It's so hard today to find a movie that keeps you on your toes.  The whole family was spooked, definately a must see
B00E3QJ7ZG|5.0|\\"High Plains Drifter\\" is a sort of Horror Western. A awesome mix of Clint Eastwood western and supernatural revenge saga with its' eerie score and familiar \\"man-with-no-name-enters-small-western-town\\" introduction followed by lots of moral ambiguity and a sort of unholy retribution. Clint plays the title character like he plays most of his action roles as a tough, soft spoken and surly gunslinger, only his actions prove less heroic here amidst a slew of gun battles, humiliations, dynamite and even a troubling sexual assault. Playing like the scarred flip side of his later \\"Pale Rider\\" (1987), this offers Eastwood as a more punishing force but no less mystical as he seems invulnerable and disappears into landscape by the film's end. Instead of bringing the town together to fight greedy tycoons and their bounty killers from \\"Pale Rider\\", he turns the town on each other and continues to mock, degrade or annihilate any of its' denizens with the exception of a saloonkeeper's wife and a dwarf played by Billy Curtis. The town harbors a terrible secret that Eastwood's character seems to have been summoned up from thin air to discipline them all for. I don't believe this film has ever looked or sounded better than on this blu ray. There may be no special features aside from the trailer, but the movie really does speak for itself and if you're a fan of Eastwood, or even Sergio Leone, this weird and cool film will likely not disappoint. It certainly has a better visual/audio treatment than many current Eastwood blu rays.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Bought this for my husband, and started a tradition! Every year, for Christmas, he gets the new season of the big bang theory. It's pretty great. =)
B000FBJHZS|5.0|great book.  dan brown is the greatest story teller that has ever lived on earth. The flying monkeys in the wizard of oz are scary.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|We thought it was going to be another clich&eacute; movie but it had an unusual twist.<br /><br />the acting on all parts was really good - very believable for the most part.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to horror lovers.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|Took our boys to see this movie and we had not even watched the first one yet. We absolutely loved it! We went out that week and bought the first one! :)
B004132HZS|5.0|I had watched some of these episodes on PBS.  I wanted to see all of these in order.  I have been a fan of most any Sherlock Holmes presentations, print and video.  This idea of moving the story to modern times has been done before, yet this was fairly well done.  The DVD itself is of good quality, plays well.  I will probably buy season two.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Quick, smooth download. Features are practical and easy to use. Love being able to fine my favorites channels and subscriptions quickly.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read series  of this book and its great...would recommend it to those who like a good steamy romance...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so well written. I didn't want to put it down. The characters, hazel and Gus, win your heart. Definitely makes you think deeply about life.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I never like when a series ends (I always want more) but Allegiant wraps up the series very well with out being cheesy or jumping the shark. You will laugh you will cry and you will walk away want to \\"Be Brave\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love the game to doze all the coins and you get all the prises and puzzyls.geting shower coin is best
B00F91H666|3.0|Although this movie, like most these days, lacks that something special, it was an overall decent zombie movie with some really cool scenes.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Quick Ship, Love the item, Thank you! Have loved this movie for a long time, just loved Jessica Lang in this movie and Dustin Hoffman is wonderful.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|I really liked it. It was hilarious. The characters were good and the story line was amazing. I wish they taught us more about the artifacts.
6305428425|5.0|Quick Ship, Love the item, Thank you! My daughter came over to my house at 10:30 at night to get my copy of this movie and woke everyone up! She obviously loves the wacky comedy that this movie is. So I bought this copy for her. Problem solved!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best purchase I've made in a long time. it work on iPhone and computers. i love it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to purchase books in a snap on my computer.  I love having my book on my Kindle and my app on my phone.
0425256162|3.0|I love Alastair Reynold's phenomenal worldbuilding skills - the world he crafts in this novel is a beautiful, and his background as an astrophysicist gives the universe a believable feeling. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the plot.<br /><br />The plot seems put together a little too conveniently - and has a few too many bits of deus ex machina to be really believable. A total of 3 characters who are presumed dead at the beginning of the novel, are revealed to be alive at incredibly convenient moments. Furthermore, the quest the protagonists go on isn't actually necessary.<br /><br />I can't really critique the plot in any more detail without giving away spoilers - so I'll end it here. The book itself was pretty enjoyable, though you may end up scratching your head at the plot after finishing it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited a long time for this game to work on my kindle, and finally it's here...just hope it continues to work. This is a very fun game and everyone is playing it....now I can join in the fun when I'm away from my pc. Thank you AMAZON!
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|I cannot get this game to download onto my kindle fire, I have tried numerous times and still haven't had any luck.
B00DW1WR14|1.0|I decided to give the samples a chance, something I hadn't done since I heard singles off Yield and Avocado.<br /><br />Sounds like they suck even more than ever. I was never a fan of the band, and I thought Vitalogy was a ridiculous album when it came out (I know no one would agree with that, but who cares - people rave over Green Day's crap too) because it all sounded like amateur garage rock. Spin the black circle, Whipping - you're telling me that YOU can't write riffs like that? There's something strange about the PJ fan mentality for sure. And Buhh-ter man and Nawwthing maaayHHHnnn were overrated too.<br /><br />Pearl Jam is up there with U2 for being overrated except of course U2 actually had some good songs till 1984. PJ have a handful in their entire career. Here's to you Rolling Stone, Rock hall of fame, Village Voice, Patty Smith types: keep listening to this proud hipster music, grow that beard, read Huffington Post, cheer Obama (same as his predecessors), more power to you. I'm out.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Had a hard time with this game installing and trying to get it to work, will return if possible today.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I, unlike most other reviewers, thought the ending was well done and the most realistic I've read in a long time. Just because it's not a perfect ending doesn't mean it's bad. I think this book ultimately teaches young adult readers a lot about how to handle setbacks, disappointment and heartbreak, and offers a refreshing change of pace from the fairy tales most of us are used to.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the book was the lack of distinct voice between the narrators. Thank goodness the chapters were labelled, otherwise I never would have known who was speaking.
B0060D11OU|4.0|a good movie for all ages~ family fun<br /><br />it's funny, sad, happy ~ many emotions<br /><br />songs are catchy<br /><br />movie is inspiring
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Hail to the king continues to grow on me every time I listen to it.  This album continues the growth of Avenged Sevenfold as a band after the loss of their former drummer.  This CD rocks!  Looking forward to seeing them play this on tour!  I especially like the way M Shadows voice sounds on the last track of this album.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|I WANT to like John Green.  I do.  But after &#34;An Abundance of Katherines&#34; and now &#34;The Fault in Our Stars,&#34; I'm giving up.  The couple's romance was not compelling.  The philosophy crammed down the reader's throat was annoying.  Disappointment all around.
B000286RZM|5.0|I chose this rating because I really love this CD, and it fulfilled all my expectations. It's great and I would recommend everyone to order stuff from Amazon.com because everything is great and commissioned thing comes right on time. Thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this came so much it's so cool I just want to play it all night<br />It's really great  solo great but the thing is like it does not feel my finger when I try moving side to side
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so so happy that Amazon finale brought candy crush to us I enjoy playing it I give it five stars because it is a fun game
006202406X|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am an adult over age 30, not a teenager, and I have been a huge fan of YA fiction and in particular, this trilogy.  Divergent was amazing and fast-paced, with a fascinating world, intriguing characters, and interesting concepts about morality and human nature.  I fell in love with Tris and Four, read the book at least 6 times, and shared it with several friends.  I, and we, also enjoyed Insurgent.  I loved learning more about the faction dynamics, the absence of a love triangle, and the realistic portrayal of grief and the trauma that Tris experienced.  Parts of Insurgent were frustrating - Tris almost turned into the Katniss of Mockingjay, which I despised - but overall, it left me wanting more.  I patiently waited 17 months for the end of the trilogy, reading VR's blog stating that she needed more time to complete the story.<br /><br />*Spoilers present below*<br />And then, we get the disappointing mess of Allegiant.  I honestly kept wondering if it was written by the same author whose ideas I had so enjoyed in the first two books.  It was choppy and dull through the first 2/3 of the book, the romantic tension that was so well-executed in the other books felt forced, none of the characters seemed like themselves anymore.  She turned Tobias into a needy, insecure weakling.  She destroyed the concept of Divergence in favor of the GD/GP \\"Big Brother\\" nonsense, left the characters languishing in an airport for most of the story, put Uriah in a coma for most of the book before killing him, and kept introducing barely-developed characters (Nita, Reggie, David) who I could care less about.  The only part of the book that felt anything like the others was the final third, which was utterly, and unnecessarily, heartbreaking, because Tris died for no clear reason.  Yes, it was in her character to sacrifice herself, but she'd done it before.  Caleb should have sacrificed himself for Tris in the room where she died, and Tris should have survived.  Period.  The end was beautifully written, but I hated what was happening.  Leaving Tobias and Christina - who had already suffered abuse, wars, mind-control, the deaths of most of their friends (for a social experiment) - utterly devastated, and apparently, scarred for life given the still-present desolation of Tobias' lifestyle in the Epilogue, was just CRUEL.<br /><br />They didn't have to ride off into the sunset together on unicorns.  Seriously.  But given all that they had survived, letting Tris start a new life with Tobias would have been a hopeful ending.  Knowing that they were still traumatized by all that had transpired in a year or so of their young lives, but still able to move forward, would have been enough, especially because the war about genetics was still raging in other parts of the country.  As written, I wish I hadn't read this book.  And after the mess of Suzanne Collins' \\"Mockingjay\\", and Lauren Oliver's \\"Requiem\\", from two other trilogies that started off strong and ended badly, I'm hoping that Ann Aguirre can pull off a showstopper with \\"Horde\\", because I seriously need it.  (Same goes for you, Leigh Bardugo and Laini Taylor!)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the movie, I decided to read the book. I have to say the book is much better than the movie. I am looking forward to reading book number two.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am not usually interested in zombie apocalypse but this series is much more than that.  I enjoy watching group go through all the ordeals and seeing the python always makes me smile.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why is the game so old school? Well,first,my brother said that the game<br /><br />is old. My dad said that the creator wanted the game to be like that
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Was able to get this as a free read on my kindle. Have read all of the Honor Harrington series and am looking forward to adding them to my kindle library.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ever since I starred playing Candy Crush,  I been waiting for the oppertunity to be able to play it on the go and not just at home....... Sooooo Happy Now!!!!!.......:)
0060837020|5.0|I am a huge fan of Plath's poetry and her life story is just fascinating. The Bell Jar is no exception-- probably because it is semi (mostly) autobiographical. She does an amazing job of painting a picture of the life of a young woman in the 1950's who falls into the mental health system and her journey through her own illness. I wonder what else should could have done if her life wasn't cut short. If you've never read it before you won't be sorry. It's an easy and entertaining read that will make you think and open your eyes.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I love this new album!  If you were expecting it to be similar to Together I can tell you it is not! This one is not as operatic as they have put more pop songs on the album. They do some duets and some solos. They chose the songs to demonstrate versatility and how they have grown in the past year. Sony Classical has done a far superior job of balancing the accompanying instrumentals and choir with their vocals so we are not struggling to hear their beautiful voices. Jonathan chose opera songs for his solos and they are all amazing! Charlotte chose songs from her favorite venue...musicals..but threw in one opera song for good measure. Her voice is beautiful! Contrary to what some say, I really enjoy that they included two Christmas songs, both of which are among my favorites.  I think my favorite track is Jonathan's version of Va Penserio. I cannot listen to it enough. Other versions of it have huge choirs singing the good parts but Jonathan does the whole thing! Wow!  If you are looking for a musical treat for your ears you should buy this album.
B008OOYALE|5.0|will someone give me your storm8 id please and thanks I need the gold I will try to return the favor thanks
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is true that the directions are extremely limited at the onset of the game, it is brief and to the point, \\"Escape.\\" Hey! If you were trapped in a room and needed to escape, there would be no specific instructions. You would have to be resourceful by looking for what was left behind by the captor(s) and try to make use of those items so as to escape!!! I'm enjoying the game because it causes me to use the analytical part of my brain in a not so commonplace manner.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Very fluent naration, great story, impeccable writing, reliably convincing characters, superb insight into what really drives us on, brilliant masterpiece.
1455526959|5.0|Michael Connelly out does himself in this one. All his books are good. I have gotten pretty attached to Harry Bosch.

Had to buy some other app to connect to TV.  Very misleading and disappointed.  Only had a few days with daughter and wanted to watch movie at home. Shame on you.
B00266YOAI|5.0|She is just a great author. Alone will keep you on edge and has a good ending. I enjoyed it.
0385523394|4.0|I really appreciate the story that Piper tells about her real-life visit to Federal prison. She is a good person who is put into a bad place, but her compassion and respect for her fellow prisoners makes this compelling reading. I came away feeling that this book is capable of motivating people to change a system that is obviously in need of repair.<br /><br />Thank you, Piper, for sharing a story that might make a difference in the lives of women prisoners.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|It's a funny movie, but definitely the first one it is the best.  I like the Chinese character is very cheese.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|I loved the first one, the second was so-so, and the final installment was absolutely horrible.  I watched it with hopes that the second one was just a mistake, but turns out the third also failed to live up to my expectations.

So what do I do now,  I don't see any info on the amazon site for returning unwanted season purchases.  If you know how to do this please pass it on.
1416583432|5.0|This is a great book for all dog lovers and people who want to understand why people love their dogs so deeply or wondered how working dogs are able to do their jobs so well--better than a human in most specific cases. Being from multi-generational dog loving and training family, there were still several things that surprised me to learn. And i've been fortunate to see firsthand hundreds of acts that a dog can display of recognition or almost precognition of things my human senses are too dull to pick up. I've also seen amazing acts of loyalty and love that are unparalleled except in a relationship between a dog and their human(s). This is not a Bill Bryson funny dissertation on dogs. This author is a scientist and treats the IMPORTANT information as that--important. If you need to be entertained to educate yourself about a subject, this might not be your style. However, if you want to learn amazing facts and theories of why dogs are as perceptive, loyal, and loving as they are, you can find it here. I especially enjoyed learning about working dogs and their superior senses that allow them to do the jobs given.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I love TV series that has good drama and sci fi. This second to the original Stargate SG 1. Wish the series continued.
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|This is a welcome upgrade from my Laserdisc version of a favorite film. It plays cleanly, loads fast, and has a sensible menu. I can't comment on how this compares to any DVD versions, but this Blu-ray version does not disappoint. Details in the shadows and fog are very good overall and the sound is excellent. I watch films on a Mits 75&#34; Laservue and this looks great.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As much as I tend to read this author with my tongue in my cheek, I cannot deny the total absorption he provides and his so crafted knack to spin a great `ole yArn.  What a greAt story to revisit. Characters I care about. VILLIANS I want punished!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Wow.  Rush.  Still rockin' after all these years!  What an incredibly talented trio of musicians.  This album shows that they've still got it.
B00FPH6A70|2.0|...cliche after cliche.  So, they move into this old house and then accidentally discover a boarded up passage that leads to the furnace?  Didn't they ask about the furnace while they were in the process of buying the house?  I was expecting something so much better based on the reviews.  Could barely watch it all the way through.  It was incredibly trite and boring.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like the game but I haven't play it to long to be able to tell you much. I know that it is easy to work.
B00280LYIM|5.0|My dyslexic daughter has found the love of reading and tracking with this series. We have the audible version and she follows along w the kindle version. Opened a whole new world of books for her with these two apps! Happy happy mom!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|If you are at all a fan of PG Wodehouse, this is a great portrayal of his classic short stories.<br />If you are like me, and noticed Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie together and thought that would be a great combination, you are in for a treat.<br />This show is very funny, though it is more dry British humor, and the design of costumes and sets really takes one back to the roaring 20s in Britain.<br /><br />It was an impulse buy for me and I find it well worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally adding the most addictive game EVER! I've waited.....and I am happy I can play on my kindle instead of my phone.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a great little pre Halloween treat, thanks amazon :-)  good physics based game, lots of challenges, and funny anecdotes to boot, great for kids but equally fun for the rest of us.. I just wanted to add a footnote here as well, I read all the others reviews, and I can't stand the haters that say the graphics are lame, or not good, well I am a graphic artist, and they are very well done, and original... Please download, the android SDK, and make even a calculator,,, see the work that goes into making an android app. Before you say its crappy.  And the others folks that say I don't think its worth any money.... I wish I could go to your job, tell your boss to fire you cause your not worth your salary.. It would hurt your feelings right, well how do you think it makes, these guys feel. I triple dog dare any of you to make an app, better if you can then by all means diss the guy, but if not shut yer pie holes, and respect the time and work these small devs put into their work. :-)  just sayin'  ML
B00BU18U82|5.0|I live on a farm and I must say, its very realistic! The prices don't change which makes it even more realistic. It also adds a lot of fun to the Game. There are some downsides though: It is very hard to navigate around because the the world in the game is so huge. The fact that the cars driving around don't follow actual driving rules does not help either. There is no option were you can see strait ahead of you. You can move the camera in so many different positions, except striated ahead, so you really cant see were your going.<br /><br />Other that that, you should downlaod it! It is very fun!
B00FEX2ZFG|4.0|Dear The Conjuring,<br />You scared me. But I'm beginning to understand why... here's a list of everything you &#34;sampled&#34; into your movie:<br /><br />An old scary Victorian house, a scary tree, a scary pond/lake, scary children in white nightgowns, scary children that sleepwalk, a scary basement, scary hidden spaces, scary antique furniture that moves on its own (like multiple rocking chairs that rock when no one is in them), doors that open and close on their own, clocks that stop at 3AM, a scary TV that comes on with static, a scary children's toy that plays creepy music and has a spinning mirror and a clown that pops up, a scary life-size doll that moves, a dead dog, birds that fly into windows and die, spirits that grab your feet when they aren't covered with a blanket, a steady-cam-scene, a scary girl-looking-under-her-bed-scene, a scary scene where the lights go out and all you have is matches, a scene where a team sets up their paranormal surveillance gear, a scary children's game involving clapping, murder-suicides, a priest, someone speaking Latin, multiple exorcisms, a noose, a creepy locket... yikes.<br /><br />I could be mad you stole these things, or that you packed some many cliches into one movie, but you reminded me why they were scary in the first place. And for that I thank you.
0761169431|4.0|My son saw this at Target, I told him if his grades improved he could earn this reward. His grades improved, I saved some money by ordering from Amazon. The book is great if you are a Oragami & Star Wars fan: my son is just like me. Some good father/son time to enjoy with these creative activities.  My son loves it.
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|I prob say this on every Pearl Jam reviewww I write but I am a huge fan so take that for what it is worth. So I will say this is a good release but in some ways something is still missing from the glory days of the 90's. Up until Yield I would give every Pearl Jam 5 stars. I think since then it has been all 3's and 4's.<br /><br />Whether this is fair or not I miss the forst two drummers. Jack Irons was just a beast and is by far my fav PJ drummer. Ever since Matt Cameron become drummer the releases have lacked a certain umph and it is frustrating. Look, Matt is a great drummer but he is more straight-forward rock IMHO. Something with how he jives with the band isn't the same as the one's prior.<br /><br />The first drummer left for personal differences in the band, Jack Irons hated touring and the long shows PJ does. They get along great with Matt so good for them. I still love them but miss the old days when every song seemed to be epic. These days you get 2-3 great songs, 3-4 good ones, and the rest are OK.<br /><br />With all that said, this is as good as Backspacer and that was their best since Yield. I would give this one the nod as Backspace was a short release at just 36 minutes.
0375842209|3.0|I baught this book for my daughter because it was the book they are reading at school. Amazon delivered it on time. She finished it and she said she was disappointed with the ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the best game I've ever played. it's just as good as temple run. take my advice whoever you are and play this game

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great app. My kids love playing it. It is one of the few apps that they do do not get bored with.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|All my kids enjoy playing this exciting and funny game!  Even my three year old has fun with this one.
B00DB624GS|5.0|Fleetwood Mac has gone through several incantations, but Then Play On captures the ever-changing band at its best, most creative, and most insightful.  Their blues is tight, blended, and carefully constructed.  The instrumentals are fluid and dynamic.  The ballads ooze with fine touch, soft singing, and elevated chorus.  How one band could create such a thoughtful album is what makes rock and roll special.  This is their Music From Big Pink, Blonde on Blonde, Revolver, Beggars Banquet.  Then Play On finds Fleetwood Mac on the cusp of commercial success.  The songs are one time different from each other, and at then similar.  I have enjoyed and appreciated this album since I first heard it in 1970.  This new, expanded version of the original line-up is even better.  I am over joyed to have this as a part of my ever expanding, always adjusting, mutating musical collection!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Couldn't be any better. What every tablet needs. It even pronounces the words. Easy to use and to look up words.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The marware kindle caze was received on time...is a very nice case to protect your kindle at a good price...
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|These beautiful cards have a wonderful .message each time you pick one. The gentle music is lovely and the images are very nice. I picked one every morning to start  my day. They help me stay close to my angels.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Who does not like Legos.  Enough said.  Not really difficult if you can read. Price is much lower than at TpysRUS
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|For a free game it is good.woul recommend.nqot as much fun as the others but still worth playing any it was free
B00EA8UEZ4|1.0|Was not believable .First book was very helpful in studying and understanding course of miracle.<br />I think Gary wrote this him self with out help from accented masters from first book.If this one is<br />Not true what about first two books.To much ego involved with this book. Do not believe Gary<br />Anymore.<br />Very disappointed in book and Gary Renard
B000I8COBW|5.0|Ok all you primitive screw heads... This... Is my boom stick! I've loved this movie for 20 years! Buy this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|my parents love it I love it to that it's. my idol steve. mnecraft is my most favorite game on the ipad
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is my favorite!  I play every day, every chance I get.  I recommend it to everyone I know.  I like the colors, sounds and most of all the challenge of getting through a level.  Some levels are hard and I am thrilled when I finally make it.  Keep it going!
B008XG1X18|5.0|lots of good info & tips, recipes, etc... its where I go to when I want to build something, cook something or anything else
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|Having heard some of their biggest hits on the radio and seeing them years ago on SNL, the box set has been great for instantly collecting their efforts to date.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it. I do get annoyed at some of the levels but I still love this game very much.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game and have spent hours playing it for the past 3+ years. The thing about the game that I don't like is that you loose all your progress of you change devices.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King at his best!  I first read this book in the early 80s...now I needed to reread before Doctor Sleep...The Shining was as deliciously good today as it was 30-odd years ago!
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie has EVERYTHING:  a fantastic cast, great dialogue, an incredibly interesting plot, plot twists, a soundtrack to die for and much more.  Patrick Fugit is William Miller who, while still in high school, gets the chance to write a piece on a band on the brink of success for ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE!  Although warned not to ever &#34;become friends with the band&#34;, he does just that.  William meets an utterly charming, beautiful groupie, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) who steals every scene she is in.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are amazing as band members.  I don't want to give away any more of this FUN ride.  You HAVE to see it!  Worth every penny and much more!
B007RKPO84|5.0|In general I am mixed on European metal and don't really follow Kreator, I had the Coma of Souls album and loved it but found their earlier work seemed more generic.  When I heard the title track on Liquid Metal, I ordered the CD and have been listening to it for a few weeks now.  It has everything I like about the coma of souls album with a current upgrade of speed (guitar and drumming) and production.  I love the vocal style and production.  The only part that could be better is they clearly have adopted an &#34;In Flames&#34; influence with takes some track too far into the anthum / power metal genre.
B008220AVW|5.0|This is more of a documentary about Katy Perry than a movie, but I don't care what they call it:  It is really, really good.  You get to see how Katy Perry grew up with a strict Christian upbringing (her father was a reverend) to how she finally heard rock music at a friend's house and was hooked!  She is adorable and has kept a lot of those values from her childhood (NO TWERKING for her!).  She has such a generous heart that before every concert she has a \\"meet and greet\\" with a lot of her fans and is especially wonderful to children.  You see how taxing it is on someone's personal life to tour and even how physically draining it is.  The cherry on top is getting to hear so much of her music and watching the energy in her concerts.  This would be interesting to anyone who wants to learn about \\"the making of a rock star\\", not just Katy Perry fans.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Boring. Flat acting. And it seemed a bit too long. But the design, costumes and photography were pleasant at least.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of book.Kept your interest from first page and didn't stop till it was done.Have recommended to all.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is the best John Grisham book I've read to date.  I have been a fan for years and have read most of his books. Some much better than others, but this one relates back to what he's good at(the courtroom). I especially liked the idea of a continuation of the people not mentioned in the hanging.  It left me wanting to learn more. He captures true Southern life, then and now.<br />Tv
B00F4PM6WG|1.0|I never got this app after ordering it!  Yes, I know it was free, but I was hoping to have it to share with my grandchildren on a recent trip.  surprise -- no app!  Very disappointed!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game that is addictive. It's very entertaining and keeps you involved trying to clear all the spaces and get the ingredients to the bottom. I especially like the fishes.
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|This application not arrived on my kindle. I don't know how to receive the application again. I hope that someone can help me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like puzzle games you should so down load this game it's better then some of the other puzzle games I have download
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|If you're looking for a movie to enjoy with your kids then this movie is a great choice!  My 12 year old son even enjoyed this much as my 7 year old daughter!  We have been happy with both Monster's movie releases and this &#34;prequel&#34; is just as excellent as the 1st Monster's installment.  Usually a 2nd movie isn't as good as the original....but in this case it's a toss up.  Some people are writing very critical reviews of this movie...but take it from me, it's worth the money and your kids will want to watch it over and over again...and it won't be painful for you either!  We all laughed and enjoyed this film the entire way through!
006202406X|1.0|What a total blow to your faithful readers. I am so upset and disappointed by this ending. I will not buy any of your future books for fear you would take me on another emotional ride with a depressing and sad ending.  Utterly disappointed.
0061730335|5.0|I read this book before and was very impressed with the young man.  this copy is for a friend who with her husband travel to Africa for mission trips often.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|The idea of a society that sacrifices &#34;the chosen&#34; of it's children on an annual basis is an awful thought (much worse that the gladiators of ancient Rome).  The movie was well done - I just don't like the story line.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|Loved, Loved this story. Love cats anyway but Bob is really  something else. .Really enjoyed both Bob Books that I've read
1441856579|5.0|The book opens with Bosch on trial in a wrongful death lawsuit. He knows he got the right person known as the Doll Maker but during the trial another body is discovered and the suspense begins.<br /><br />The trial scenes were getting on my nerves just a tabdit, but there were a lot of secrets revealed about Bosch during those scenes that made them enjoyable.<br /><br />Bosch makes a choice to keep the concrete blonde unwraps until  after the verdict. Not such a good place because the relentless prosecutor Money Chandler already knows about body and brings it out during the trial.  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOWZERS!  The story takes you on a thrill ride but just when you think you have it figured out Connelly drops another bombshell but when the copy cat killer is revealed after an unforeseen death the book will leave you shaking your head and waiting for the next Bosch story..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It's challenging and rewarding at the same time! I would recommend and have recommended this game to other friends!

B004JMY312|5.0|Loved it as a kid. Still love it as an adult. Obviously a kids/family movie, but Midler's Winifred Sanderson is actually a pretty fearsome villain.
B00DB2JQ7W|4.0|liked concept second disc with guest artists, a good country/rock fusion jam band,Warren Haynes very underated as a guitarist,in my opinion
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I love the fact that it has more than 20 free levels it has 200 all free.It is challenging enough to play and easy too fun for all ages.From cute - kitty4427
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! I have been waiting for Candy Crush on my kindle fire forever! Ive played it on facebook a couple of times but I would reccomend it to anyone even if you have never heard of it than get it! fun for all ages! (and I'm not just sugar coating it.)
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I found it very hard to follow and that it had no meaningful message.  Just a lot of shots of Brad Pitt thinking about things;
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This Fall Out Boy is one of the best they have produced.  I thought their first CD was great but this one is even better.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|its very easy to use. and I have noticed my kindle working better after I clean it. I had no idea how much memory was left over from something like Angry Birds
B006MVJ2L4|3.0|I really like Adam Lambert but I was disapponted with this CD.  There are many great songs on the CD but once I  listened to the entire CD it really wasn't as good as I thought.
0812982622|4.0|Good read! Excellent portrayal of conditions in a society with no respect for human rights and dignity.  Appreciate authors research and revelations about North Korea.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very good book I read it because I liked the movie so much. But heard the book was better so I decided to read it and now I can't wait to read part two and see the new movie that comes out.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Fun easy encouraging  read. Anyone who wants to test these principles should give this a try. It's fun and it works.
B00CL50LEC|2.0|Really, of all zombie films I've seen, this one is the worse.  I mean, great plot, but the story gets lost quickly because of the boring moments throughout the movie.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Most of the reviewers are correct this movie was absolutely fantastic. What I'd like to mention is the special features. As Amazon has underated this description in saying there are no special features. This is completely false since I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole disc specifically for special features! 14 featurettes, a directors notebook, and the digital artistry of Pacific Rim. There is also a commentary track to go along with this feature among many more.<br /><br />The movie itself has all you can handle of action in it as well as great story telling by the director. I was on the edge of my seat till the end in this feature. I highly recommend this movie with top ratings.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great and interesting story line.  Who doesn't love a great story?  Seems the relationship between the United States and Iran has always been tumultuous.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|My daughter and I watched this movie together. She liked it a lot and called it a good movie to see. I thought it was okay to watch but Not a movie I will buy.The one thing I loved about this movie were the voices of the character's THEY were great.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Love learning about history.  Story takes place during the French and Indian war that eventually led to England taxing the American colonies to pay for war expenses.  Taxes led to &#34;no taxation without representation&#34; which culminated in the American Revolution.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The whole series had such a great story with unexpected twists. It was written to where, when reading, you feel like you are the character and can feel the ups an  downs of their life. Through th  whole series I wasn't able to put the book down. This last book took a huge turn into something very unexpected.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Been a fan since season 1.  Life is still ongoing for the survivors.  People continue to die and zombies are still zombies.
B00G0KY1UO|5.0|Best GAME in the Universe. I like how you can be all your favorite characters and unlock costumes for them. Buy It Now.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have taken my phone into the water so many times with this case on it and it is completely fine. I love it.
B0050KU3IY|5.0|Loved everything about it. Could not stop reading it!! Wish there was another sequel to the books. Didn't want it to end
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Well I was not crazy about this book until about half way through it. I did not like the two point of views because I fell in love with the mystery behind Tobias s. To me it did not feel genuine to the first to the first two where I craved more and I felt their emotions. However, I must say that you know you have fallen in love with a series when you cannot even make it through an epilogue due to crying like a big baby. It is now over and my life is over. Thank you Veronica Roth.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This movie was so far ahead of it's time it was incredible---yes, somewhat silly now, but when compared to anything else from that time period it was a masterpiece.

B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Loved this book and have read nothing like it.<br />Section 2 life changing.<br />Outstanding characters with provocative mind sets. Makes living here with first world problems seems dream.
006202406X|1.0|Don't even read this book, it's so meaningless. I am extremely disappointed. I hate Veronica Roth so much. R.I.P, Tris. Just pretend the second book was the ending. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS, SAD, DEPRESSING BOOK! I understand authors have to kill their characters some time, but Tris had so much to live for! This is not a way to end a series. Please rewrite this book. I seriously cried...Goodbye, Tris. We'll get back at Veronica for killing you. If I could rate this zero stars, I would.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I enjoyed Broadchurch more than any production I have seen this year. The acting, the scenery-were topnotch. I ended up seeing the whole series and I would encourage every one to watch it.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I was lucky enough to get one if the first edition and I love her so much she does so many poses ,and I can't wait for the rest of the soldiers to come out . But this toy is not for little kids because of all the small pieces that could get lost very easily
B007SVPZMW|2.0|I downloaded this when it was an FAOTD. It is just basic Tic Tac Toe with a three graphic variations. If you play against the computer, the easy level lets you win and the difficult level ends in a draw if you know what you're doing. I don't know what the medium level does. It lets you choose who goes first but doesn't let you choose whether you want to be the O or the X. Two graphical variants are animated. The animations are very slow and not cute enough to be anything but annoying.<br /><br />I suppose it is okay if you want to keep a young child amused for a little while, but only download it when it's an FAOTD. I can't imagine paying for it.
B00AEBBA36|4.0|Really does the job. One of the best. Quality of the product is excellent.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|I had a bit of difficulty at the beginning understanding the controls and the objective but it's probably because I didn't pay close enough attention to the opening sequence and also I'm a bit slow on the uptake sometimes :) Once I figured out what I was supposed to be doing, I found it fairly entertaining. The physics are similar to Angry Birds, although it certainly doesn't have the variety.<br /><br />After a few levels I am finding it fairly challenging. While the challenges are similar to Angry Birds, as another reviewer mentioned, the controls are a little too sensitive. I haven't yet figured out the scoring -- how the coins are awarded or what it means when you \\"die\\".<br /><br />While I have never been considered prudish, I also have to agree with the reviewer that found the depiction of the girl too sexualized for a game that's meant for children as well as adults. The first glimpse one get of her is of her heaving chest! It's amusing, but a just a little too much.<br /><br />Update: I'm up to level 13 and am starting to feel frustrated. Some reviewers say the game is too easy but I'm finding it pretty difficult. Figuring out the strategy can be hard to begin with and once you figure out what you need to do, you have to get the positioning, aim, and velocity exactly right. The main problem I have is the controls. Dragging your finger both moves the screen and launches the bombs/rocks - which means that when I'm trying to pan the screen to see where I'm aiming, I sometimes launch a missile by mistake. Or when I'm trying to launch, the screen moves. Also, unlike Angry Birds, where you can see your birds and your targets if you pan out, with this game you can't pan out so can only see parts of the picture.
0307352153|4.0|If you're an introvert, read this book so you will know how to capitalize on your reticence. If you're an extrovert, read this book so you will know more about how introverts think. Delivery of the book by Amazon and UPS was fast, and the price was competitive.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. I play it quite a bit. A recent update caused it to crash but the support I got by e-mail talked me through fixing that.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|People are upset with the ending. Her death seemed less meaningful by getting shot than if she'd died of the serum. That seemed contrived. I'm not outraged. I just don't see the necessity. Overall, I still like the story. I'm guessing people won't read this one over and over, though.
0142410314|5.0|I just finished reading this book out loud to my 7 year old daughter. We read a few chapters every night and she couldn't wait until It was time to read!  Throughout the day she would often talk about the book and wonder what was going to happen to Charlie and the other children that night.  My husband even got in on the fun and joined us for the story.<br /><br />  I won't explain the plot or give anything away, but I will say that It is a very funny and entertaining book filled with a kind of dry humor.  True, some of It may be a bit outdated, but I like to think of It as \\"classic.\\"  A few things needed to be explained to our daughter, but not enough to distract from the story.  I didn't think there was anything too inappropriate in this book.  Maybe some of the language wouldn't fly in a children's book written today.  The characters say things like \\"shut up,\\" for example, but nothing really worse than that.  I didn't think there was anything frightening here, either.  My daughter can be sensitive to \\"scary things,\\" but had absolutely no problem with this.<br /><br />  I was so happy that my daughter loved It so much since It was my favorite when I was younger.  In fact as soon as We finished the last page, she took the book and began trying to read It on her own!  Any book that can do that deserves 5 stars easily!
B000TDGGRY|5.0|This was my last Sigma book to fill in the gap as I have read them out of order, it doesn't matter. It was FABULOUS and Breathtaking! Thanks so much for another wonderful, informative tale. I want so much to see this on the big screen. Okay so you get the idea that I love these books.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Addictive--reads like a guilty pleasure but surfaces deeply disturbing questions about technology and our rabid share economy--especially for someone like me who has been in the dot com biz since the 90s.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Boffo entertainment and total camp with great performances by all including Michael Douglas and Matt Damon with notable appearances by Debbie Reynolds, Rob Lowe and others.<br /><br />Funny, poignant and glamorous, a real (or should I say “reel”?) glimpse into one of the world's most talented and unique entertainers who was born before the time gays could be “out” of the closet....and Liberace's closet held one of the most spectacular wardrobes ever seen.<br /><br />Not for children or those that lack an open mind. Deserved every award—and more—it received!
0812550706|5.0|Ok, you've seen the trailers, you've done a little research, and you realize it's based on this. Obviously, it won't be as good as this. So, here goes...Andrew Wiggins, genius. 6 years old. Called Ender by an older sister who at the time could not pronounce his name correctly. So, the powers that be have been watching him, been plugged in to him in a very real way. They also were plugged into big brother and sister at some point.  And we had the Goldilocks problem with the first two; one was too hard, the other, too soft. Hopefully with Ender, it's just right. So, we pluck him out of his every day routine, let him knock the tar out of a bully before leaving, and take him to Battle School.<br />At Battle School, we force him into the same type of scenarios he dealt with planet-side. He is made to stand out, be different, isolated. He endures and thrives. Best everything. Youngest everything. Put him through the ringer to have him come out shiny. And of course, it ends the way we want it to. The good guys win. Or do they?<br />Here is the other layer to the read. He is lied to by the powers that be, the adults he is supposed to be able to trust. Of course, he doesn't find out the extent and depth of the lies until the very end. He knows he is being used, just not totally in the way he thought. The story is well written. You do get into Ender's head space and it is easy to follow his emotions, and be upset when he is, to feel some empathy for him when he does certain things and certain things are done to him. We learn that not everything is black and white. That good and evil is a perspective. I think any of us would do what Ender does in the story, given the same knowledge at the time.<br />This works well as &#34;just a story.&#34; But, I think trying to read it that way will be almost impossible. Orson Scott Card's writing style draws you into the story so quickly that you don't realize it until you're hip deep in it.. Sit back and enjoy this wonderful book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love minions and it is so much fun I am addicted to it so much I play it all the time.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think this is an awesome way to get back in touch with reading the Bible.  Especially in these modern times. I like to listen to it being read to me during quiet times when my family is busy and I am home alone. Brings me closer to God and Jesus.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|No body can develop their characters as well as Stephen King. I like the idea of letting us see Danny all grown up.  It was great to revisit the Over Rock site.  If you never read The Shing then watch the movie.  I have read most of Stephen's books and I am a fan.  Can't wait to see this as a movie. This book explains why his father was a alcoholic.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|**CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />Let me say that I absolutely loved the rest of the series, but I can't believe this is how it all ended. I'm a fast reader and this took me over a week to finish. I kept on feeling like it was going to get better, but it was more of a train wreck then I could have ever imagined. The language and description were repetitive and dull. This \\"gut-wrenching\\" ending seemed to just be for the sake of trying to make a spectacle. I think that recent popular YA title have spoiled us all with neat, tied up endings, but the last 40 pages literally just made me shake my head -- I understand why Tris did what she did, but it felt like the new John Green status quo of shock and awe versus a well thought through ending. Lesson learned, never try to world build in the final book of a series, it really drew the reader's focus away and it made the characters and event seem so flat. Also why not explore some of Tobias' pain after Tris' death. There was so much depth there, especially with how complex their relationship dynamic had gotten, but instead the characterization is flat and boring. This very 3 dimensional couple we'd grown to love was nothing more than kissing her \\"slim form\\" and his \\"strong arms.\\"<br /><br /> By the end of it, I'd totally lost any emotional connection I'd made with these characters. It's a shame to feel this way about a series I'd really loved up until this final novel.

The good news? The movie is a good one for the grown ups, too. Great dialogue, all sorts of old western overtones and references, and even a brief appearance by Hunter S Thompson. While I have jokingly said I both bless and curse Johnny Depp several times a day, we're still enjoying this one several hundred viewings in.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the book. It is nice to see the continuation of one of King's best characters of all time. The book was creepy (but not as scary as The Shining). The new characters were a lot of fun to read! I was a little skeptical when King decided to make a sequel to The Shining, but I feel this book delivered on my expectations.

006202406X|5.0|The book felt real. It didn't rehash old plot points. Instead Roth gave readers a new world and new conflicts. Readers are furious over the ending, but it fit. I support the author's right to write her book the way she sees it.

B00DZJ82W6|4.0|You wouldn't be reading this if you didn't think Moondance was a great album. So instead of reviewing the original music or the alternate takes, I'm going to focus on my perception of the sound quality and mix of the 2013 remastered cd, the 192kHz/24Bit high resolution blu-ray, the Japanese manufactured cd and the original North American cd. I don't have a surround processor so I can't comment on the 5.1 mix and I don't have an lp version to comment on either. I bought the Deluxe set specifically to get the high resolution blu-ray, hoping that it would provide the best audio quality.<br /><br />First things first. The 2013 cd and blu-ray in the Deluxe set are not just a remastering (i.e. cleaner sound, with a little boosting here and there to improve the sound quality of bass and drums, or compression to increase overall volume levels). Both of these are also a remix of the music. This means that the placement of instruments in the soundstage is different, the relative prominence of some instruments/vocals is different and the amount of reverb/echo is different. Depending upon what you value, you may or may not like these changes or more likely, you may have a mixed reaction.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, the 192kHz/24Bit blu-ray is excellent. The music is very clean with no hard edges or distortion and instruments sound very realistic. The musical content is well balanced from bass through mid-range to treble. This is the best \\"audio sound\\" of any version. This is what I bought the Deluxe version for!<br /><br />The 2013 cd for some reason sounds very different. The bass is very, very boosted. So much so, that while listening on a good audio system with full range speakers, my attention is drawn to the bass every time. As a result, the bass seems to overwhelm the music in the mid range and treble (acoustic guitars, vocals, cymbals etc). Overall, this makes the music sound muffled. I think the mid range and treble information is there, but the relative volume of bass overwhelms the music in the other ranges. A few other reviewers on here have commented on this and referred to it as sounding like a blanket was thrown over their speakers. This impression is exacerbated by the new mix which also reduces the prominence of horns and acoustic guitars. In contrast, on the new blu-ray the bass is always well balanced and clear. On the title song, Moondance, I've always \\"heard' the walking bass, but this is the first time I've clearly heard the exact pitch of each note.<br /><br />I'll use Into the Mystic to illustrate the difference between the old mix and the new blu-ray version. (The new cd remix is similar to the blu-ray, but due to the amount of bass, \\"sounds\\" different). The original mix has some instruments placed very hard left or right. The horns for example on Into the Mystic are placed so far right, that they are almost exclusively in the right speaker. The horns also have a lot of reverb giving the impression that they are in a larger and different room then the rest of the band. The most noticeable change on the new mix is that the instruments are distributed better across the soundstage. Your attention is drawn more to the music and less distracted by the placement of the instruments. The low, reedy sounding \\"foghorn\\" is in the centre rather than hard right and the horns, while still on the right of the soundstage, don't sound like they're just in one speaker. There is much less reverb on the horns. This is all good.<br /><br />Another noticeable change is that the horns are mixed lower. Van's voice is the central focus of the music, with less \\"competition\\" for attention from the horns, especially on the louder passages. The remix of the Band's Rock of Ages on the recently released Live at the Academy of Music 1971 makes a similar change in the new mix. Initially I found both unfamiliar. I've decided I like this choice on both releases, but it's very subjective and I can understand that some people will not like this change at all. This is especially noticeable on the last one minute of Caravan, when Van is doing the lead \\"la la la la la\\" vocals and also backing himself. You can hear the various vocal parts in his backing chorus more distinctly, but the horns don't contribute as much rhythmic punch.<br /><br />The remastered sound of acoustic guitars sounds very good in the new versions. They are however lower in the new mix. As with the horns, little guitar licks don't pop out as much in the new mix. This is OK on the quieter passages at the beginning of Into the Mystic for example, but as the song progresses, especially in the last 30 seconds or so, I miss the hard driving rhythmic strumming that engages in a sort of call and response with the horns.<br /><br />One final comment on Into the Mystic. The new mix has a very noticeable tambourine. I like it, but I've never heard it on a previous cd version. I don't know whether it was on the original lp. I assume, it's another example of the change in instrumental balance in the new remix.<br /><br />A quick comment about the Japanese cd release. It's not really a remaster. I think some processing was added during the transfer process to boost the midrange and treble across the board, but I wouldn't say it was \\"remastered\\" with a remastering engineer, producer or artist making aesthetic choices about the sound. It mostly sounds like the North American cd, but with a bit more boost in some frequencies. It sounds fine, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way buy it.<br /><br />On the whole, I'm very happy with the high resolution blu-ray, including the new mix. I'd have preferred it if it had been made available in a 3 disc version (1 remastered cd, 1 disc of outtakes and the high resolution blu-ray).<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention the blu-ray menu. When you insert the blu-ray it into your player, there's no automatic pop up menu to choose the 5.1 mix or the stereo. The 5.1 mix automatically starts playing even ifyou just have a stereo system. You'll have to use the \\"audio\\" button on your remote to find the menu if you want to play the stereo mix.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book.  It kept me up for several nights.  Didn't want it to end. The twists and turns were fantastic.  After the final chapter, there  is an epilogue that you want to be SURE to read.  It is unlike any epilogue I had ever read.  The author really gets you thinking.  I usually read mysteries, spy thrillers, that type of book.  This was a little out of the usual for me, but I have to say it is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  No bad words (well just a few)  No horrific violence.  Just a really good read!  Try it, you'll like it...
B00CATSONE|5.0|Loved the book, the only bad thing I could say is that I wish it was longer. It really educates people about the history behind some of our greatest inventions.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Basically a violent shootup movie done with an highly irreverent attitude - an attitude of old friends enjoying bragging about their good old macho days.  The only real acting was done by the stunt men & women.  The stunts and cartoonish plot was purely escapist viewing and thus fun to watch.
006202406X|4.0|First off, I just want to say that I absolutely loved Divergent and Insurgent. Even though I didn't like Divergent for the first few chapters, I started to like it more and more as I read on and ended up loving it. I've been waiting for the past few months for Allegiant to come out since I finished the first two in July and with the huge cliffhanger in Insurgent, I was hoping that Allegiant was going to be even bigger.<br /><br />I was a little wrong. I thought that it was very slow, kind of boring at times, which I wish I didn't have to admit to that. it was really hard to distinguish whose POV I was reading. I had to keep going back to the beginning of the chapter to see which one it was. As much as I love Tris and Tobias, their actions were somewhat the same at times. For some reason, Cara was always touching her hair. Most of the storyline just seemed unrealistic and hard to believe. It was much more convincing in Divergent and Insurgent, which is why I do feel like this book was kind of a let down.<br /><br />The ending. -----SPOILERS!!!-----<br /><br />I think most people, knowing how Tris truly is, probably expected her to sacrifice herself for her brother, Caleb. She may not have realized it until the very last minute since Caleb was supposed to be the one to go in the Weapons Lab, but she comes from Abnegation where you are to be selfless. She always thought that she was selfish, but as it turns out she never really was. Even Tobias saw it the minute she dropped to the net in Dauntless HQ.<br /><br />What gets me (and that someone else had mentioned in another review) is that Tris lived through the death serum, when no one can survive through it because it seeps into your skin and kills you, but Tris who is Divergent, lived through it, only to have David waiting for her. You'd think as obsessed as he was about GP's and GD's that he'd want to experiment on her to figure out how she survived the death serum, but then we know what he does next.<br /><br />I'veread a lot of reviews about how everyone is pretty upset about the ending and I am in a way not too happy ether. - how Tris dies, how sad and depressed Tobias is and oh yes, it is truly depressing. I've cried and cried and can't seem to stop. The main character that we've grown to love has died, has left behind the one person who she loved and he claimed to be her new family in Insurgent after her parents sacrificed themselves for their only daughter, while Caleb betrayed all of them. I could not stop crying the last 30 pages of the book. It is truly heart wrenching. After waiting so long for this book you only want Tris and Tobias to finally have a nice happy ending to live their lives how they've always wanted to, which is very upsetting to find out that it doesn't end that way.<br /><br />I've read people complain that it leaves you with no hope, but I think in a way it does and I'll explain that in just a minute. I feel like I can somewhat relate to Tobias' grief in problems in my own life. After Tris dies, he wants so badly to just take the memory reset serum and to forget everything that has happened, which I and I'm sure other people would like to forget things in our past as well, but Christina convinces him not to because it would be just like Tris never happened. The good out weighs the bad even if the bad is so hard to get through day after day. We know that Tobias is brave, but as he says on page 509 - &#34;There are so many ways to be brave in this world....&#34; --  &#34;Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life. That is the sort of bravery I must have now.&#34;<br /><br />Two and a half years later shows the hope in Tobias. His life has continued even though he's without the one he loved the most. He's reconciled with his mother and hope it all goes well. He has a job and is gun-free to try to live a better and safe life. He faces his fears by going on the zip line (something that Tris loved to do but Tobias was afraid of heights) and does it all for Tris, the one he will always love and never forget, in memory of her by spreading her ashes. He has his friends and Tris' friends by his side and to always have the memories together. &#34;Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We can't escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other.&#34; This is the hope.<br /><br />Lastly, I just want to say that this has been one of the hardest reviews I've ever written on anything. I can't stop crying. I'm giving it a 4 star rating even though the story wasn't as good as the first two books and has a terrible tragic ending that will be very hard to forget anytime soon, I would recommend it, especially if you've read Divergent and Insurgent. I just want to warn you if you do decide to read it. - Be brave.
B00ERIUO02|3.0|I applaud Katy Perry for her efforts to evolve her music sound. However, I'm not completely a fan of the change. While there are some definitely jewels on the album (\\"Legendary Lovers\\" \\"Unconditionally\\" and \\"It Takes Two\\" come to mind), many of the songs blend together in an indistinguishable blur of lackluster instrumentation and and monotonous \\"four-on-the-floor\\" beats. The problem, and the saving grace, is that Katy and her producers place a lot of emphasis on vocal melodies and not much on instrumental melodies. Every song is essentially repetitious chords.<br /><br />The other issue I have with the album is the distinct lack of guitars. As her albums go, Katy moves farther away from Pop-Rock into electronica, and while that's all fine and dandy it's not what I look to Katy Perry for. I like the funky riffs of \\"California Gurls\\" atmospheric guitar of \\"Teenage Dream\\" backing her throaty vocals, not syrupy synths blaring loudly over what seems like endless anthems of self-love and empowerment. There's some good stuff on here, but it's nowhere near her best. Back to her Cotton Candy clouds!<br /><br />Download This: \\"Unconditionally\\" \\"It Takes Two\\" \\"Legendary Lovers\\" \\"Birthday\\"

B0068TJLSY|5.0|Okay this movie is not too serious, but Steven Steilberg directed it, and he did an AWESOME job.  The actors were first class, and the movie effects were fantastic.  At times we were scarred, and at times we were laughing our heads off.  Like I said, it's not too serious--not a Texas Chainsaw massacre, and it's something you can watch with your family.  Very tastefully done, and you will be thoroughly entertained.  This is a great movie for a Sunday afternoon.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I began my journey in this tale with the HBO series. I am and will remain a fan. Now I can add the written version to my fandom. Martin has crafted a rich and vibrant world of Lords, Ladies and Knights. We are met with the brave and honorable as well as the scoundrel and knavish. And finally, we have Dragons. This is a story of schemes, wars, peace and love. And, once and for all, it is the Game that will consume all. Winter is coming and the Game is afoot. 5 Stars and more.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This Blu Ray is a combo with DVD, Digital Copy, and Ultraviolet option. The front cover does not say it but the description was correct. I enjoyed this movie but was not happy with Denzel Washington's character. He is a great actor that brings the drama to the screen. Good story line. I would have paid to have seen it at the theatre. Thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, but can be addictive! Some levels are harder than others and can be frustrating. But overall a great low key game
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This was a great blu ray combo movie. Enjoyed the story line and acting. Well made. Cannot disclose the story line. You must see it. I saw it at the theatre and had to buy it for my collection. This is a blu ray, DVD, and digital copy combo. The price of $18.00 was worth every penny. I recommend it to anyone. Thank you.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great novel I can't put this book down. The True Knot cult freaked me out.  But overall I loved this novel it was creepy and scary!!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I saw it three times as a movie, something I've only done once before. It is intelligent and well written and well acted plus watching the Enterprise rise out of the ocean was worth the price of all three admissions. Characters are well developed and now comfortable in their roles. Wish we had more of Bones and Scotty but Scotty's scenes were priceless. Khan is a worthy new version and a far better villain than Nero in the first recreated version. A bit too long on the near destruction of the Enterprise but that's the way films are these days. However - and this is the reason I suspect some dislike it - what were the writer's thinking with those last lines - Spock defer to Kirk on where to go on their first 5 year mission? That is so out of character for both of them. The tension between them is what makes things work.<br /><br />But that aside please, please continue the series - 5 years? Sooner we hope, we hope.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|IT WAS SO GREAT. i loved it!! never saw it coming. love sherriff rick!  i will definitely keep watching season 4
B0081BU42O|5.0|This is the best Culture novel I've read. Fascinating philosophy with skillfully escalating action. As usual, the artificial intelligences the &#34;Minds&#34; are among the most interesting characters. Only in Excession were they more vividly drawn.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|We have been waiting for over a year for Candy Crush on our Kindles. I love everything except I have not been able to sync with Facebook yet. I also don't like having to wait 24 hours to complete another quest to move on to next episode. Other than those 2 things, I love it!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Not sure what happened with this book, but Veronica Roth did not write a good conclusion for her book.  If you are someone who hasn't read the book yet, don't.  It's a waste of time.  Just pretend Insurgent was the last book in the series and leave the rest to your imagination.  I wish I could give this book 0 stars I'm so disappointed with it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I did a review on Allegiant on my Goodreads account which is posted below.  Everyone is entitled to an opinion.  I know that a lot of reviewers can't believe that some have given the book a 1, 2, and even a 3 star rating, when the other books in the series receive a 4 and 5 star.  I loved the Divergent Trilogy up to Allegiant.  Allegiant has a lot of open plots, lazy clean up for characters, and even some areas where I felt the book dragged on.<br /><br />Bottom line - Read the book for yourself and decide what you think.  Go into reading the book with an open mind and block out any reviews you have read.  I never read a spoiler as I wanted to process the book and write a fair review based upon my opinion of the book.<br /><br />My Goodreads Review:<br />*Update - 10/27/13* - After some sleep, I thinking about Allegiant overall without the influence of other reviews, I changed my rating to a 2 which is deserved.<br /><br />I know that no author is going to please the masses. I had given the first 2 books 5 stars. My ratings were well deserved. Allegiant was written with very little action, jumping on the train one time, which we learn later in the book it is controlled by people in the city and slows down. Blowing up a hole in a wall is not the action a reader wanted, we wanted to see Divergent action.<br /><br />I cried with the ending and hoped that the book would have ended differently. No author can keep all the characters. Different plots and bland characters bent on power or revenge make up this book.<br /><br />Sometimes authors produce gold and fail to live up the standards of their readers. Veronica spun gold twice and couldn't do it for a third time.<br /><br />10/27/13 Review<br />I really wanted to give the book 2 stars but I chose 3 as it did get interesting around chapter 40, but it also felt really drawn out. Allegiant was nothing like Divergent and Insurgent. I read both Divergent and Insurgent 2x. I struggled getting through with Allegiant. For me, I didn't have much of a stronghold to keep reading. A lot of other readers, myself included, felt the first 2 books could have finished the series. I felt a few times that Veronica was grasping on a ending. I still don't see why the book took 18 months to be published. The mix of chapters from Tris to Four was confusing. Four didn't seem to have his character personality as he did in the prior books. Gone Girl did the character transitions from chapter to chapter much smoother. Several times I found myself wondering who's prospective I was reading from. Not to give anything away, read the book if you want to see how the series ends. Don't read the book if you want a complete spin off of the first 2 books and being placed in a Maze Runner setting.I didn't have much of a stronghold to keep reading.

B004LUS390|1.0|This is probably a good app if one knows how to use it, I could not find clear instructions so I played with it a bit and just kept going around in circles. Ended up deleting it since I could not get anywhere with it. You may think it is obvious how to use, but I have learned that you never assume others are on the same page as you. Better to bore them with detailed instructions than to assume they know how to use. Maybe the paid version is better, I don't know.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I was really looking forward to the release of this book.  I preordered the title back in September.  As soon as it arrived, I dug in for what I hoped would be a fun, interesting read.  I was very disappointed.  The author goes on for pages with inane tweets.  Tweets are bad literature in real life....why would they make for good literature in.... a book!  Blech...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A heart wrenching book. yet so full of life,  even though Death is the narrator.  I am intrigued about reading how the people were affected during this terrible tragedy.  I am of the belief we should never forget nor never let this happen again. The characters were strong and each unique not unlike many people in my life.  I really enjoyed the book and being an optimist. wanted a happy ending.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Pretty decent movie.  Loosely based on the book.  Ibteresting characters and concepts were developed. Watch it, it is worth it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great tale with engrossing characters.  Truly evil villains, as always. Loved finding out what happened to Danny Torrance. Couldn't put it down!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|We really enjoyed watching this. It was entertaining and clever and it told a great story about accepting change without giving up who you are.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Entertaining but why aren't Zombies dead as a literary genre and turned over to the nut case survivalists? Stephen does best with human connections.
B005QKYIZ2|4.0|I really love this CD, Florence and the Machine is one of my favorite artist.  I really love many of these songs, especially Seven Devils, however I'm not in love with all of them which is why I didn't give 5 stars.
1613771355|5.0|The only complaint I think I'd have is that the outside cover seems rather weak. The fancy black cover of the spine has started tearing and peeling pretty easily, so I have to be especially careful about keeping it in a safe spot. Other than that, the book itself is amazing.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Absolutely love this app!! Spent years playing on the computer and now I can take it every where!! Highly recommended.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|i enjoyed the first two books and eagerly waited for Allegient's release. what a let down. slow, dull, boring, and filled with too many far fetched situations. sadly, the ending was the only part of the book that kept my attention because i couldn't decide if i liked or hated how she wrapped things up. all in all, very disappointed.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|The Thing is not a remake, but a prequel to John Carpenter's cult classic of the same name, where an alien being crash-lands on Earth after a supposed malfunction in its ship. The year is 1982, and a Norwegian team stationed in Antarctica have just uncovered the ship, and the frozen occupant. Recruiting the help of paleontologist Kate Lloyd, the financier of the discovery Dr. Sander Halvorson and his assistant Adam Finch then escort her to the dig site. But after they recover the creature and celebrate, things take a turn for the worst when the being awakens after thawing out, and begins killing the crew one by one. But the Thing doesn't just kill them, it assimilates them, becoming them. So, how do you fight something you can't see?<br /><br />Directed by Dutch filmmaker Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr., The Thing is a surprisingly well-made prequel that does the original justice, but not in the best way possible. If this prequel wanted to really define the greatness behind The Thing, it would have been longer, taken different twists and turns, but ultimately end at the same conclusion. Instead, it plays out a lot like the original film. When I mean a lot, I mean some of the scenes play out almost exactly like they did in the original, like when the Thing attacks the group after they try to help one of their own, revealing itself to be the injured party. Now while this isn't bad, it still would have been better if they did something more original. The acting was superb all-around, especially the slight show-stealing Lars, played by Jorgen Langhelle. The visual effects were overall good, having some truly award-worthy effects, and some run-of-the-mill effects that were alright, but kept the effects from ranking along side films with some other great CG the same year (Cowboys & Aliens, Real Steel, and Super 8). Though the scene that deserved an award just for the awe-inspiring feeling it produced was the shots of the alien craft starting-up. The effects were and still are some of the best, which is kind of surprising for a $35 million movie. The script was good, nothing award-worthy but living up to the original, and Marco Beltrami's score was just great. Keeping the same theme (which appears in the end credits) from the original, Beltrami creates a haunting and eerie sound-scape that is very memorable and spine-tingling.<br /><br />Honestly, I really don't get why this movie bombed at the box office. Was it because of the theatrical trailer? Did people actually listen to the critics when the movie came out? If so, that's sad. If you have seen the original or like science fiction/thrillers, get this. I'm not sure that there are many movies that can or have had a prequel treatment that's as good as this.<br /><br />4/5 Stars****
B007THA4FI|2.0|Runs hot and cold, hard to keep track of the players. Perhaps too much attention to family squabbles detracting from the story line. Actually the story line was weak to begin with.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Is there a rehab for this candy crush drug cuz I download this app on all my devices. I will tune my kids and husband out if I'm getting too stressed and candy crush brings me right back to solace.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is more than the typical solitare game but easy to catch on at the same time. You will enjoy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It is realistic, with a lot of current events built in.  If you like spy stories, this is for you.  It is well written, with a lot of cross and double cross situations.  I couldn't put it down.
B0002IQMKM|3.0|only three good songs on it.. if this is the best i would not like to see the worst.  you may ask you self
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Fun, little sci-fi adventure, filler with 80's cultural references, especially to video games. For someone like me that lived thru this time it was a trip down nostalgia lane.<br />I wonder whether it appeals as much to younger people?<br />While the story is a little thin, the flow of events never slows down enough to make you think too much, which is probably a good thing. I couldn't decide if the story was truly a creative synthesis, or more a roman a clef leveraging the lives of Jobs, Wozniak, Melinda and Bill Gates, and above all Richard Garriott, with 80's nerd references, first hand MMO game experiences, and first hand help desk experiences thrown into the pot to hold it together.
0670033049|5.0|This is my new favorite classic. It's written so well, the depth of the characters and contrast of good and evil is amazing.  Chapter 24 is my favorite part!<br /><br />I bought a used hard cover. It was a library book, and is stained, and I can't get the jacket off. It should not have been represented as in good condition. This copy (I have mine on my iPad) was to have been passed on to others. Oh well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play the hard levels and my little kids play the easy levels with parental controls on to prevent purchases. I expect to purchase more levels in the future.
1476727651|5.0|You do not have to have read The Shining to understand this book. It was fast paced with well developed characters.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is very enjoyable, sporting realistic environments and pretty decent graphics.  The guns can be more specifically upgraded, and there are more to choose from.  The energy can be gained much faster, and there is a nice variety of game.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Use this when I travel on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7. Not as seamless as on my Kindle and as the screen is bright, frequent breaks are needed. But good when I need more than just my Kindle on a trip.
0385732554|5.0|My son had to read this in his 7th grade class, and his teacher suggested the parents read it, too. I did, and it was great! Really gives you something to think about. Interesting read!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is my favorite yet book by Veronica Roth. The only part I didn't like was the death of my favorite character, Tris. She was there since the beginning of the book, I learned things I never would have learned anywhere else from her, she taught me that selflessness and bravery are the same things, and sacrifices are made to save the people we love. I will always remember Tris and the adventures I spent with her.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app...  Easy way to check battery life.  Its great when you are playing a game or reading because it warns you when the battery will shut down and how much longer you have until it shuts off.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Just got this on my kindle and I can see why it's popular on android. Great graphics and simple controls.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The story telling was first class. I recommend this book to everyone. Marcus inspires you with his never say die attitude, his love for his colleagues, his family and his home.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Dirty Dancing is a Really great movie. I love the dancing and sound track. Who knew Pattrick Swayze could sing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love solving all of the unique puzzles and unlike most virtual games , I get a sense of satisfaction when I complete a level. A lot more fun and mentally stimulating then candy crush or virtual family type games
0446547654|4.0|I enjoyed the powerful relationship between Dawson and Amanda and how the book takes their story from when they first met in their teen years to 20 years later, what happened to each of them in all that lost time and what's to come.  It's a page turner but I just wish the ending turned out differently and I'm betting most readers will agree with me on this too.  I'm not revealing it because I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read the book yet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this game especially choosing a random deal or a winning deal. It`s great if you get stuck figuring out a next play&hellip;then you have the option of getting a suggested move. Try it you will enjoy it!<br /><br />.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I know all stories don't have to have a fairy tale ending, but I enjoy ones that do. I'm sad that this will be a sad ending movie for Tris and Tobias as well.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant by Veronica Roth<br />The last of a trilogy marketed as &#34;the next Hunger Games&#34;, Allegiant finds protagonists Tris and Tobias/Four going outside the walls of Chicago, the city that has been their entire world up until this point. They leave behind a city in chaos and revolt against a rebellion (and yes, that's as confusing as it sounds).<br />In my opinion, this book had many of the same flaws that House of Hades had: the author rushed too much. The story wasn't developed enough. It felt to me like the first draft of the story I'm plodding my way through right now: needing both cohesion and clarification.<br />The story itself was good--maybe brilliant, poignant--but the execution was not on par with the ideas of the story.<br />SPOILERS AHEAD for both Allegiant and Mockingjay<br />I liked that it was Tobias who lived instead of Tris. Tris had a complete feeling about her, even before she met Tobias, but Tobias was a broken man hiding behind four fears.<br />At the end of Allegiant, he had faced every single one of them in a more substantial way than endlessly going over his fear landscape. Fear of heights (which I think might actually have been symbolic of a fear of losing control over his life); claustrophobia (being metaphorically 'put in a box', limited by the world's expectations...Marcus's son, Dauntless, GD); fear of becoming like Marcus; fear of losing Tris. He had faced them all and come out a whole man--someone who was more than Four, stronger than Tobias.<br />I liked all these ideas that Roth presented...I didn't like how I had to keep looking for the names &#34;Tris&#34; or &#34;Tobias&#34; to tell me which POV I was in. Tris is a much more straight-forward character than Tobias--they shouldn't both speak in the same voice. Honestly, I didn't think that Tobias's POV added anything until after Tris died. Yes, it was cool to see Tris from another angle, but at the cost of his mystique. Up until Tris died, Tobias never felt like the kindof character to let us in his head so intimately.<br /><br />I have always had a problem with Roth's pacing and credibility....I'm not, and never have been, completely sold on her set up, either with the factions or the whole GP vs GD thing. Or indeed with the solutions used to win the war. A mass memory wipe and Evelyn's 180? Sorry, no. I've reread the end several times and I still don't see how Tris's sacrifice saved the world. I see how it saved Caleb in more ways than just his survival, but the world? No; and I couldn't help thinking that if I was David and that girl was trying to erase my memory, my life and the memories of everyone I knew, I'd have shot her too. I think Roth was going for a neat solution but it just didn't fit, in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end, it was a good story but my original thoughts after putting down Divergent still ring true: it's trying to feel like the Hunger Games. And for me, the Hunger Games did not stay as words on a page. That story has infused itself into my bones, and the end of Mockingjay remains the most beautiful, poignant thing I have ever read.<br />In the end, happiness is the ultimate rebellion against this cruel, cold world. That Katniss and Peeta could be happy, even when they couldn't be whole...that will stick with me for far longer than Tris's sacrifice and Tobias's grief.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like the Weather Channel app, especially when you are away from home.  I have this app on all my devices.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|A whole new set of Elton John originals written and sung in vintage Elton John style - a must for every Elton John follower
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Wasn't sure about the movie based in the title. 'Stupid' love? But it was a funny movie. Good choices for actors.
0062206044|5.0|This is the first book in the series and once you read it, you will get hooked. My son was reading these in elementary school and would start talkiing about the story line at home.  It was a great way to have a really interesting conversation with him, as the characters are quite interesting, and you really fear for the children's safety.  This is one series that will never get old or forgotten.  It has become a children's classic.  The first book, Bad Beginnings is my favorite.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Awesome season! After 8 seasons the story does a twist at te cliff hanger...it is awesome to see some characters back this season too!
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Tom Hanks is one of the most talented actors from my generation. I love him. He's the best. Can't wait for his next movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Non stop entertainment...so enjoyable...never gets boring...no glitches..no problems....just solid game play...recommended highly...get it now...fun filled over and over...just keep playing and playing and playing and playing
B008602KQI|5.0|If a movie does it's job and keep me entertained, that's a good movie.  But when they leave me waiting for more, and I'm not mad about it, that's great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game allows kids to build their own houses or anything else. This is cool especially because they make things from their dream. No one can judge it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The visual in this movie is great. The story a little different. A nice twist of thought at the end.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I do not normally read erotic books but so much publicity about this one had to see what all the fuss was about.  Poor story hated the ending, but suppose it is to make you buy the next book in the series. Hmm will I continue with them....?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Right up the with the King classics....a new favorite!  Highly recommended and addicting! Constant Reader...a gift from Uncle Stevie! Enjoy!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I am a huge Malcolm Gladwell fan, have read all of his books, and was excited to learn David and Goliath was being released.  It is not his best work, but even subpar Gladwell remains provocative and enjoyable.
B0063M22QO|2.0|Only have tried it 2 times and ran out of moves with both games.  Hint didn't work for me.  Will try some more later.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I didn't hate the movie, and I suppose I'll be glad to have it. I sure don't think it's an Oscar winner on a par with the best of its predecessors.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is spy fiction at its best, with great writing, a snappy cast of characters, and good attention to detail. A fun read for any fan of the genre.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Best seller ! A+++ Fast shipping as well! Thanks for such a great item !<br />Out of a 10 The Walking Dead Season 3 Limited Edition Boxset is a 10 ! A must have for any fans !
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Super easy to use. Need Google to continue with providing the promised apps. When that happens I'll give it five stars.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love this show! A friend recommended and it lived up to what she said about it. Can't wait to see the other seasons.
0446577391|5.0|Baldacci never fails.  I love reading his novels.  Keeps you on the edge and wanting more.  Looking forward to more.
B003WUYOQ6|2.0|too  much info to comprehend - made for medical personnel - recommended by my doctor - but too difficult to comprehend
B00BB67UNW|5.0|Shipping was quick and the movies were packaged very well. The price was a good deal. The movie itself was pretty good, had a good story and a twist at the end. I would recommend it to others.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Won't load on my kindle fire! I downloaded it twice and still didn't load is it just me??!! I've been waiting for this for months and now it won't freaking load??!! This really sucks....
B00E0SX118|5.0|We loved this movie.  When it explains a fathers love and family devotion the way it does it really lets you appreciate good fathers.
B003V4ASV8|4.0|I found this book engrossing.  I knew very little about North Korean history and life.  What I liked was that it was documentary in nature but it had personalization of real families and their lives, thoughts, experiences which makes reading a lot more interesting than mere facts.  It was an eye opener and educational.
B008602KQI|5.0|But I did!<br />I watched it while doing my threadmill and did the longest jogging (without stopping) I've achieved!  Now I can't wait for the next series of this movie!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wish there was a way to buy an unlocked version...the game is wicked fun but hate waiting for lives.  Wish they would develop a paid version
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love everything about this series!!!  This is a catch up for me and I am so glad I went back and watched this season and now season 4
B00CLD65X0|5.0|A great entertaining series with quality acting and plots. Downtown Abbey could continue for years with the creative mind of the writer.
B006UV8DJS|1.0|No instructions let me do one picture and now won't let me do anything else. Worked alright when it worked.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|What is there not to like about this movie?  As with the original Monsters Inc movie, these movies appeal to all ages.<br /><br />A great movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this challenging game...very happy I can play it on my Kindle Fire now!!!  Play it on my phone all the time. Love it on my Kindle.  I did say LOVE being able to play this game on my Kindle Fire. :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The thing to use for reading my books on the go.  I never have to worry about leaving a book behind.
B00FX8EY60|3.0|The quality of sound is good  from copying over as a mp3, but the songs themselves are just not as memorable as the teenage dream album.  Maybe the songs will appeal more as time goes on.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|This app does what it says and is backed up by the respected name of Merriam-Webster. A must have in my opinion.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I enjoyed this series so much. My heart broke for Tobias.  The struggles the characters faced and how they rose to each challenge was uplifting.
031623480X|5.0|This was very interesting to know, since wheat has been promoted for 20 years...I was glad I didn't like it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game! So glad it is available on the kindle now--- Lots and lots of time consuming fun.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|Unfortunately I started school right after I got this book and I have not time to read. In fact I have no real life at the moment. Mostly school with some social activity but I am sure when I do get time to ready this will likely be a good story.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Really love this movie!  Watch it quite often.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of movie.<br />Kevin Costner is awesome in this movie!
B008JFUR10|5.0|In Japan the Kaiju movie has a long and illustrious history.  The Japanese invented the giant monster/rubber suit movie and it is still a very successful export.  On the other hand, Guillermo del Toro has done a respectable job in translating this genera into a fine piece of popcorn cinema. The plot is simple, straightforward, and acceptably believable.  The special effects/audio/cinematography are as good as Hollywood can create.  While there are no rubber suits in evidence and all the non-people characters are computer generated, the monsters are, well, monstrous.  I mean it.  EVERYTHING in this movie is BIG!!  The only drawback I can see is that you loose a bit of impact when the movie moves to a small(er) screen.  Even on a 50+ inch LED with 5.1 surround sound and 1080p, the feeling is not quite the same.  If this is your first time seeing it then you need to find an iMax 3D theater to see it in first.  That is where Pacific Rim is in it's glory.  Still, if you have a big screen, home cinema sound system, and a blue-ray player I don't think you will be disappointed. No nudity, some mild to moderate language, and lots and lots and LOTS of metal crunching, monster mashing sci-fi violence.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Soooo well done. You just want to be a part of going back in time. Owen Wilson was really great in this movie. Check it out, if you haven't already.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This charging cradle is perfect for the traveler whom likes to a place for storage and charging at the same time,<br />Very Valuable
B0040X46TE|5.0|Always good, never disappointed. Bought extra CD as gift, knowing this.  Would recommend any CD by this performer.  A great loss.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Maybe there should be a way of summoning other attack modes on the opponents which causes great damage. Nice graphics by the way.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|one problem here Hebe my brow gets the update without doing anything!! And I have to come onto the appstore!!! we have da same kindle though!!! how does that work???
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Wow! This is a great game and I'm glad it's on kindle! When I was in third grade my teacher let us play on the ipads and this game was on it and we tried it out. Me and my friends laughed the whole recess too. When I downloaded it on my kindle it was so entertaining that I played it for the whole day. I realized there were powerups so I used my coins and I kept winning until they ran out. You can also earn characters. I have earned Scruffy and Stanley. I hope you will too! If you have the full version there are different themes such as construction sites and space. I have enjoyed this app and I hope you will too.
B0019IMVDG|1.0|Believe me this is no 'Goodfellows'.  About 3 hours long.  After 90 minutes, I was hoping every one would get 'knocked off' so I could go to bed.  But no.  I had tt g my money's worth.  Should have gone to bed!
B004MPESSY|4.0|Its hard to watch due to the very... Hard to watch scene which at one point seems to drag on forever. But if you manage to get past that then the remainder of the movie is good. Though it could be said that this movie could be a warning and a lesson that could be learned and remembered.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its about time! Thank you Kindle for finally bringing us Candy Crush!  I am addicted...&amp; tired of draining my phone battery!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game.It is better than temple run and I'm all most on level ten and I have 20 diamonds
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Would not change Nothing!! Loved everyone of them. Would recommend to any body that loves a great love story!! I think if everyone could have a love this great that this world would be perfect!! Thank you so much for sharing them with all of us!! I have read each book of the Fifty Shades Trilogy and each one of them keep you wanting more and more!! I am so ready for the movie to come out!!

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It works great on my Kindle fire hd and on my phone..it hooks you from the start, its a great brain game, it keeps me occupied when I'm sitting around waiting.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I play it all the time. Please keep me updated on other games like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yes about time love playing on my kindle fire HD great for all ages .Me , my wife and my five year old son love playing this game
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I don't like it because it is just boring. I had a better one on a tablet until we had to sell it to get this kindel fire HD.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I read a lot of books on productivity.  Most are too long and say the same thing.  This book is clear, concise and useful.  See that word &#34;useful&#34;?  Most productivity books aren't.  This one is!  I have a 4x6 card on my wall.  It incorporates language from two productivity books by the same publisher.  It says simply:  START - DO THE WORK - SHIP!  Guess what?  That's what I'm doing now.  Thank you Steven Pressfield!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm late coming to the game. . .just watched all 3 season in last two months . . .but I'm definitely hooked.  I like watching concurrret ep0isodes and not having to wait a week.  3rd season ending was a cliff hanger though. . .very unsatisfactory.  I will probably wait and watch Season 4 after it is completed.
B00ET2ODU8|4.0|I saw this movie the first weekend it came out. I knew nothing about Linda Lovelace. I did enjoy this movie a lot. The acting was top notch.
B00FHNBDC4|5.0|I don't think Amos Lee could create something bad or even mediocre. I'm a huge fan of his voice, his style, his lyrics, and his music.<br /><br />Mountains Of Sorrow, Rivers Of Song is slightly different than his earlier stuff. It feels more rockabilly than bluesy, though the blues influence still comes through in his voice. The content here shows many musical sides of Amos Lee, from the edginess of High Water to the soulful heartbreak of Burden. It's one of those albums that takes me through a wide array of emotions in one sitting.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow!  Never expected the ending to be what it was.  The book held my interest to the very end.  And the end - wow again!
B00D6BQG1W|2.0|Everything funny about Warm Bodies is in the trailer. There is no additional humor. My hopes for ninety minutes of mindless low brow humor and fun were quickly dashed. The Zombie TSA agent in the trailer is as funny as Warm Bodies ever gets, Skip it.
1451695195|4.0|We bought it because we are interested in story about the person experiencing the hereafter.. We are Christians so subject is of interest
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|the beginning of this movie drew me in. Me and my 2 daughters were entranced. I thought how nice it was that we are watching a movie together. about 30 mins later, the 17 year old drifted off to her room. The 25 year old who will stop what she is doing just to watch a commercial, soon followed. The action scene was great. The rest of the story very very dry and not even well done. I didn't feel anything from the character. Even the down spiral of this character wasn't done as well as movies with the same plot. And to name it \\"Flight\\"? Very misleading. I should have read the reviews. soooo. that's my opinion of it, for what it's worth.
B002K99P7S|5.0|Plain and simple. Great story line, and I enjoyed how everything played out. Especially what happens between Logan and Victor Creed. I can watch it over and over again, and not become bored with it. It's just one of those movies that sticks with me, especially when you have such talented actors in the mix.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|It works but I am unable to print from my email. Was able to print out a picture but it doesn't give me the option to print from Email.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|V for Vampire is a physics-based puzzle game where you as the vampire try to reach the helpless maiden by navigating around various hazardous obstacles such as lanterns, skeletons holding lamps, and other vampire bats. The backstory is told via cute animated cut-scenes - basically, it's your (vampire's) birthday, and this entire adventure is a bday gift from Frankenstein and the rest of the ghouls and monsters. It almost sounds like they got him some sort of weird Groupon deal :)  But I digress.<br /><br />The game is pretty polished with nice graphics, animation, music and sound effects. It's impressive seeing that this is a version 1.0 release from the developer. The initial stages do a decent job as a guided tutorial, teaching the various gameplay elements. After playing through the tutorial, I found myself decently entertained but also slightly frustrated with the control for targeting and moving around. Basically, you pull back from the vampire a la Angre Birds to fire your ammo. To cancel your shot, you hold and drag the control back to the vampire. To move the vampire around, you tap on the area of the map you want him to go. Several times, I accidentally fired shots when I tried to move or cancel the shot. It would be great if the developer can tweak the control sensitivity so it's not so trigger happy.<br /><br />The only other thing is maybe more levels with tougher puzzles. The game has a built-in cheat sheet/solution guide for when you get stuck. I haven't needed to open it yet.<br /><br />Actual installed footprint on the phone was 35.83 MB, right where it's supposed to be. The permissions required aren't too excessive, and I didn't encounter any ads or force closes/crashes.<br /><br />Overall, this is an entertaining game that's great for killing time. It fits right in with Halloween just around the corner. As the free app of the day, it's definitely worth checking out.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|first game I downloaded when I got my kindle fire. still on my kindle fire. fun game to pick up and play anytime. if you're a fan of bullet hell sytle games, you should enjoy this.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Hard to put down, the story is engrossing from the start. A definite must for fans and a great read for novices; highly recommend.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Still a lovely book. It might be a suitable counterblast to the Disneyised version. Its shorter and simpler than I remember.

1616614609|4.0|While I love truly balanced games, asymmetrical games can be very fun as well, and that's what Netrunner is. One player plays a megacorporation trying to score agenda points and/or kill the pesky runner, played by the other player, who is trying to hack into the corporation's servers and cause as much damage as he can while attempting to steal corp agenda. This game is strictly limited to TWO players as a result. The rulebook does a fairly good job of explaining things, and includes a helpful flow of play diagram on the back which you will probably want to leave face up the first couple of times you play. The quality of components is high as well; sleeves will likely be required if you care about keeping the cards in good condition, but this is true of most any card game. The tokens are made of very thick cardstock and will keep for a long time. Also, if you like to punch things out, congrats, you're in luck when opening this box! While there are enough baggies included to both sequester all of the tokens, and initially separate the corp/runner cards, you will probably want to invest in something else to store the cards. This is doubly true if you are interested in building different decks. That being said, the box is more than large enough to both accommodate not only the included cards, but also cards you may purchase in the future. You will just probably need to get a little creative as the included cardboard support can probably only hold about double the cards you're initially supplied with (if you removed it you could fit about 5 times that many, but they'd be free to fly around inside).<br /><br />A quick note: For those unaware what an LCG is, it is a format that Fantasy Flight has chosen to move to for their card games. Instead of booster packs containing a random assortment of cards from an expansion (sorted by rarity that give the cards differing collectible and monetary value), they release new material in 20 card increments, in packs that contain a fixed list of cards, with 3 copies of each (3 being the maximum number of copies you are allowed to include of any one card in a deck). This allows the game to grow and the environment to change without requiring you to spend a fortune to keep up (like with Magic: The Gathering). The expansion packs still have a MSRP of $15, however, so it isn't exactly cheap either.<br /><br />To return to gameplay: the runner and corporation are governed by similar but differing rules. For example, the corporation can perform 3 actions per turn, but always draws a card each turn. The runner can perform 4 actions but doesn't draw a card unless he uses an action to do so (this is a nice bit of theme attached to an interesting decision - I can totally see a hacker exclaiming 'I don't have time for this!' while staying up all night to complete a run). The runner attempts to access corporation servers which include the corp's hand, draw deck, and discard pile, as well as any additional server they create in order to try to score agenda points or host valuable resources. The corporation guards these servers with ICE, which have a wide range of effects that the runner must use certain installed programs to defeat. What becomes interesting is that while the runner plays their cards face up, the corporation plays their cards face DOWN, so what is on the board is a mystery. The corporation can and often will attempt to bluff the runner into believing one type of card is another, and since running can be expensive, in theory this can force some tough decisions. After playing for some time, in practice many times it can be obvious for the runner what is going on.<br /><br />There are three different runner factions, and 4 different corporation factions. They all have a unique feel, and they are all adequately represented in the base set, which gives it a good degree of replayability. I will say that the base decks as they are suggested in the rule book (i.e. including only the cards of one faction and the neutral cards) will result in some matches being completely one sided. You will want to tinker with and substitute some cards (after reading the deckbuilding guide if you are new to this kind of game) in order to improve the quality of the gaming experience. Even after doing so, some of the corporation builds can feel woefully slow, it's frustrating to be a supposed megacorporation and feel like you have absolutely no money! I'd say at this point the metagame highly favors the runner, but if you're just looking for something to play with friends and don't have interest in the game being absolutely balanced, this is definitely worth picking up, even if you don't have any intention of purchasing any of the additional expansions.n and the neutral cards) will result in some matches being completely one sided.

B00DGN51O8|3.0|Ok. Fun and fanciful. Worth the purchase, but nothing spectacular. Little scary for little ones, but entertaining and enjoyable overall
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|The holder is too bulky for my liking so I just leave it in a pocket. I know eventually it will fall out of the pocket or I will forget to remove it and put it through the washing machine.  The sleep band doesn't quite work as an activity, not quite secure enough

B00FGJNS72|5.0|The features in this app are quite comparable to MS office.  Obviously, you can't design complex, cross-worksheet indexing functions, but it's much better than docs to go.  The views for documents are much better too.  It might take a little bit to get used to the UI, though.
B00D7NWTSI|3.0|all the movie his broken ... I prefer the last two parts you can feel real IRON MAN in this movie depending on his style and how his funny I didn't enjoy that much but the audio is perfect and the picture its trully perfect ,I saw many blu-ray's but IRON MAN 3 is the best of the best you can feel like you are watch LIVE .. 10/10 for the quiality

B009LDD5E0|3.0|The question I have is, is the end of this season like just part of that year, bc it seems like in the 5th season, Artie, Tina, Blaine, etc. are still seniors. ?? I DID like the new charachters and that Funn finally finds out what he wants. R.I.P., Cory.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I don't know how I'd never discovered this film before - it's an underrated classic along the lines of The Princess Bride or Ever After, but much smarter and more unique. It's got all of the elements I love - fantasy, humor, action, and a dash of steampunk thrown in too. I watched it twice during my 48 hr rental - it was that good!
B0095VZV2W|4.0|I liked it! At first, I was afraid the previews would be the movie if you know what I mean. Then, I thought,'What if it's like the &#34;Pirates of the Carribean&#34;s?' Surprisingly, I loved it! Hugh Grant surprised me! Great family fun!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is supported on all my devices, which makes it extremely useful for keeping my notes and memos in one place I can access. It's been very handy.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|I'm not much for playing angry birds, but then again they don't put on a bib napkin b4 a juicy blood snack.  Light hearted theme is fun for this time of year.  No complicated controls to learn.  Will give me something different to do when I'm stuck too long at a Candy Crush level.  Besides it's cool to knock over skeletons into a jumbled pile of bones.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Marvalious movie. It came quick withought issue. This is one of my favorate movies and it was easy yo find and a clean cipt6
006202406X|1.0|I was disappointed by the ending yes.  How could I not be.  I think the target audience for this book (YA) many of whom are teens have enough drama and damage they have to cope with in the real world.  Many use books to escape, and to have an author drag them along for this long, then deal them this blow was unwarranted in my opinion.  It didn't fit with the style of writing she had done to this point.  It didn't fit with how the main character was able to work her way out of situations with help or without.  It just was SO out of character.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br />The other issues I had with the dual views.  Some books written like this I have enjoyed a lot, this just wasn't one of them. I will say the audio book was read well though so if you are looking into the audio book it was done well.  Reading though it I couldn't do it as well, it didn't work for me.<br /><br />I thought a lot of the relationships were strange in how they were resolved, especially Tobias and Evelyn, it was just strange to me and wrapped up in a tidy bow while everything else is collapsing like a house of cards.  It just made no sense at all to me.  All kinds of new material was added that just was not needed. There was so much left to be handled and taken care of yet so much was added it just felt like a mess to me.  Like \\"lets see how much we can throw at my reader and still close this out in so many pages.\\"  It just left me feeling strung out and tired and wishing I hadn't gone there.<br /><br />The final few chapters to me were throw \\"aways\\" as well.  \\"Wrap 'em ups\\"  Then the Epiloge where you are shown even years later our Hero is still unresolved.  I mean if you are going to go years out why not show him recovered at least, happy and with someone to give your audience some reassurance that he finds peace?  No, she doesn't do that.  We are left to wonder if he ever does and it is unsettling and uncomfortable.<br /><br />I think for many young readers, especially many teens withouta lot of life lessons under their belts, may find this kind of story is just too much to read and understand and process.  I would NOT recommend this subject matter to them and tell their parents to hold off on these books until they are older.  Or to be prepared to discuss this with them, after reading some teens responses with this they were quite distraught and their reactions seemed very extreme.  You can't blame them for not knowing how to react when never having faced something like this in their own life.  I know life isn't all tulips and roses, but for young readers a main character is a friend to them in their own world and to have them taken away like this is very traumatic so their reactions are quite extreme.  I don't actually find many of the young readers reactions that strange.  They are mourning a friend.<br /><br />I get that death was handled in other YA books, but it wasn't death of the main character.  Harry wasn't killed, Kantiss wasn't killed, etc.  You get the point.  It isn't the main focus of the story that is taken away from your reader.  I think that is the tragedy that the young readers are having a hard time with.<br /><br />Adults on the other hand, well that is a different story.  They should be able to handle this story just fine.  I am still disappointed in how the book was written for an adults, but if you are going to tackle adult subject matter than you better write to adults.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book!! I couldn't put it down.I found myself cheering and getting excited and worried.  Can't wait to read Mockingjay.
B000F8O35U|3.0|waiting for a new and better redrawing...<br />the colors and the quality of the drawings are old fashion and less impressive
006202406X|1.0|Anyone else notice Amazon has been axing negative reviews?<br />Anyway, this was the biggest sh*tshow ever. Roth threw too much at us at once, and the writing was choppy and terrible. Roth's deviation from the characters we knew is absolutely abhorrent.<br />I sold my copy for a tenner so nobody else has to waste $15 on trash (oh, and I'm broke raising a2 year old on my own). Even then I felt I asked too much for it.<br />Spoiler Alert<br />The fact that Roth killed off Tris hurt badly. Ill never be able to read Divergent again without thinking about how pointless all of her training is in the end. Ffs.
006202406X|1.0|I realize that Roth is a young author, but the prose in this book has gone way downhill from te first.  The alternating first person seems like a cheap, lazy way to wrap up the series.  I didn't even finish  the book before I got so frustrated I looked up the reviews, and now that its spoiled, I probably won't go back.
B00FG5E03W|5.0|Many interesting perspectives woven into an entertaining movie. Enjoyed watching this movie, wish it were longer. Was a pleasure. :)
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I am always a Grisham fan. Enjoyed this book as well but certainly not as good as his earlier works. Had a hard time reading it without hearing The actors from the movie &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; rolling around in my head.  Skip the book unless you love Grisham and wait for the movie.
B00F1W1SQW|1.0|this band needs a new singer.  their concerts are boring and their music is overplaying... they have butchered songs from elton john to zebra throughout the years.  the new release is just as boring as all the rest.  talented, however their music puts me to sleep...  you want to listen to a top notch act???  RUSH!
B00FN811SY|5.0|It works, unlike the previous Bible downloads I've tried.  The only improvement I can think of would be to show verses to click on, after clicking the chapter, like on the WT library software.  I love knowing I can access my Bible at any time.  Thank you for making it available.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|so sad tris :'( yeah  this book»»life Must have thanks veronica for this amazing book cant wait for the movies<br /> this made me look at things in different ways. will<br />never forget<br /><br />  Always,<br />  Ellie Winson
B000F8O35U|5.0|Great price, fast delivery for an awesome Disney classic. I enjoy this movie just as much as the kids, definitely a good purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a 5 star. I really like playing this game. I play until I have to stop, some steps are really hard to get through withthe<br /> times it takes.<br />Thank you
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|Okay, so I got here and this app only had one review - a one star review, not very helpful, but I will admit that it put me in a biased position when getting this game. And when I first installed it and started playing, the opening birthday scene was not eye-catching enough to change my mind. However, it did end up being a pretty cute game (after the first world, at least). I'm honestly surprised as to how addicting this game actually is.<br /><br />The gameplay itself is pretty good. You're basically going through an obstacle course, collecting ammo, blowing up skeletons and lamps, avoiding the light, killing other bats with light, and clearing pathways. All of the gameplay is physics-based, so aiming your ammo just right can get tricky. Each time you aim, your previous attempt is also shown as a guide. Your ultimate goal is to reach the lady at the end of the level and watch the little vampire enjoy his meal (or some other comical scene, depending on the level).<br /><br />After you clear each level, you are given a certain number of points based on how many times you either missed a shot with a bomb or stone or how many times you died in the level. You are also given coins, which you can use to buy emergency ammo rations and solutions that you can use when you get stuck. Lastly, you're given a certain number of skullheads proportional to your score. You can earn up to three of these per level. As far as I can tell, they are used to unlock things from the last screen of the menu. What those things are, I do not know yet.<br /><br />So, here's the breakdown:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great physics-based gameplay<br />- Tutorials placed where needed<br />- User-friendly menus - options for toggling music, viewing achievements, et cetera<br />- Decent storyline (weird and cheesy in my opinion, but decent)<br />- Challenging - not just easy throughout, really makes you think in some situations<br />- Good graphics and music<br />- No bad permissions or IAP<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Can get repetitive and boring pretty fast<br />- Controls aren't all that great, especially when aiming<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a pretty appropriate app for the Halloween season. It might not be a keeper, but it'll kill some time and might even make you laugh. Get it now while it's free.<br /><br />- Sam
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Couldn't believe it...went on holidays recently and saw so many little Russel's around the place (Holiday resort) :)<br />Love this movie. I cry every time I watch it. It's just a good story!!

1608871827|5.0|Fully detailed, robust, full of goodies and just a high quality Art Book all around. This is what all Art Books should strive to be-packed full to the brim, full of love and content. This is basically what the movie was to me-a breath or fresh air compared to everything else. I would HIGHLY recommend this to ANYONE even mildly interested in the movie. You will NEVER find an Art Book this wonderful, and believe me, I've tried!<br /><br />As a huge fan of the Movie, this Art Book really tugs on my heart strings. Thank you for not being cheap, thank you for showing the love you had in your movie in your other products as well. I really appreciate it.
B008MVPHRU|5.0|I really like it and enjoy this items. This is perfect purchase. So definitely I have to buy new one.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|This series just keeps getting better! So much fun to read (even though I think it's a teen book). I enjoyed the entire series!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Interesting characters, many plot twists, suspenseful at times, and a smattering of action. Plot premise a bit on the weak side but still a good read. Lee Child's writing style in this series keeps you constantly engaged. I would definitely recommend it. I am starting on the second book of the series.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This will have you crying for joy and pain. Great read, and I would recommend to anyone. I was bummed when I finished it.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|Only recently have we played these discs.  What a disappointment!  Every disc has a glitch in it somewhere.  Sorry that we waited so long to play them - too late to send them back.
B004LROUW2|2.0|I could have written this book in about 100 pages. Why do you write books WITHIN books!?! Annoying that you'd just waste that space with something that's non-storyline, and doesn't contribute to the story in any way, shape or form.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this to cast from my computer to my TV without having to hook my laptop to the tv. It is supposed to do that, but there are minimum system requirements needed which are not mentioned on the Amazon page. All is says is Windows 7 or 8, but it does not mention processor speed. Unless you have at least an intel core i3 processor it will not cast and stream at all. You need at least a core i5 3rd or 4th generation for high streaming quality.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This series just keeps getting better! So much fun to read (even though I think it's a teen book). I enjoyed the entire series!

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I can't wait to read the next books in the series! Even though I think it's a teen book, it's really caught my attention!
B00FPH6M82|3.0|The acting was ok but the plot was very predictable and there were a few overly corny scenes, that turn serious moments into laughable ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am so glad I got the chance to read this book. I couldn't be happier with it! A friend recommended it to me and once I started reading, I couldn't stop. The story line is gripping and you're never bored reading this book. The characters are unique and have very detailed personalities, making the context fun. The concepts that the writer has thought up are so amazing and he opened my eyes to so many new perspectives! I definitely plan on reading more of his books. Definetely a 5 star book!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The  Orphan Train was a great read i was so happy i found it on the amazon list it let me know how hard it was for those children and it was a great read from start to finish I would recommend everyone read it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|slow on update but the first ten is good. Hope they can make the update fast. keep the levels hard.
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|Wow. That is really all I have to say. You seldom come across such a well plotted, gripping trilogy. I'm sad it's over but glad it has ended so strongly.
B0018LX9T4|3.0|I had heard it was close to 50 Shades! NOT even close. But it was a cute movie. Worth a look.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Man I think this is one cool game this should be a five-star game just kick back and relax but...however don't let your brother/sisters bother you
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very simply put, I would get up far too early and stay up far too late to read more and more. One of the best books I've ever read... I just finished it and I'm tempted to turn to page 1 all over again.
B00CEF014E|3.0|I was curious throughout the book-- there were a lot of twists. It wasn't predictable which is good but it was overall an OK book. I definitely wanted to find out what happened but didn't love the way the author formatted the story.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great mini-series! David Tennant is spectacular, as is the rest of the cast. It's a whodunit worth watching, and it's the quality you expect from BBC.
0894803123|5.0|Purchased this for my daughter in law after using my own copy for some time. HIGHLY recommend this book! Simple, delish recipes!!
B00E193TM2|5.0|FFDP has some of the best hard rock today.  The sound is intense but not over the top with screaming.  Lead singer has a great voice.  The lyrics are typical of this genre:  full of cursing and self righteous arrogance.  FFDP is a guilty pleasure for me.  Sound is fantastic.  Oh, and they did a great job of being offensive referring to God in the feminine on the title track.  Lame.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Have watched this movie since it came out and never tire of it. It's a reflective movie and IMO under rated, a mist to add to your collection-one of Morgan Freeman's best.
B00CHVIPP2|4.0|Not a super blockbuster, but a very good movie.  The graphics are terrific and the story line good.  Didn't seem to be on a level with Ice Age or some others, but a pretty outstanding watch just the same.
B003UYUR10|5.0|These type of movies depicting ancient times are some of my favourites. The story line appears original (not withstanding the cartoon version that I am not familiar with)  and the acting by all cast was fantastic. Jack and Gamma were exceptional in their acting. What I enjoyed more was the shooting of the film-believable in all instances. The film itself is a feel good movie who's actions you can watch over and over. As I said for me it's more of the acting than the message of the movie or story line. I did enjoy it.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Watched this in HD with family and grand baby and loved it!  The picture is so sharp and clear versus old VHS or DVD.  HD/Bluray is the way to go!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally candy crush for kindle!! So much easier to play on my kindle! Colors are super! I  Love this game!!
B00CFA227C|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it definitely had a B-rated feel to it.  Imagery was pretty outstanding through most of the movie.  The acting and some of the writing left much to be desired.  Still a fun movie to watch.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|First time ever listening to Passenger! I love their music...all great to listen to over and over! I love all the songs, would love to hear other albums they have out!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Excellent game, very addictive and entertaining. The game sound is reinforcing and promotes a pleasant feeling. I play it several times a day.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I loved how her voice sounded! When I first heard her on the radio, I was like I have to find out who she is and get her album. I love her songs, they seem to have a life story to them, especially Summertime Sadness! I hope that is the name of the song, I am hearing the lyrics in my head right now...that is what I really like is when I hear a song and later on I hear the song in my head...lasting impression.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I loved this book.  I didn't want to put the book down. The story seemed real and was pretty accurate in dealing with the emotions and growing pains of a foster child.  Having dealt with children in the &#34;foster home&#34; setting, I saw many parallels.<br />I would certainly recommend this book to others.  It pulled at my heart..
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Excellent film. Strong plot. Some of the best acting you will see, the special effects are very strong! And it's just plain FUN!
067144901X|5.0|My daughter loves animals and is quickly learning the noises they make.  This book has helps out a lot with this.  She especially loves sheep so this was perfect for her!
B004PGO25O|4.0|If you are looking for deep insight and logical arguments, look elsewhere. This short book is full of stories, quotes, and illustrations that are meant to transform you from the reluctant planner into a go-getter. If that is what you need, this book is a fun and interesting read.
0671449028|4.0|This is a great book for a young child.  It's not too long so it will keep their attention at bedtime.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I Love the story. I read all 3 twice. Couldn't put it down. Need a 4th book to finish the after story
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received this as a birthday gift and it's wonderful.  I had no idea something like this existed.  We are now able to watch Netflix and Youtube videos on our regular TV without having to use our Xbox.  It's much more convenient and at a wonderful price.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Despite the fact that Bjork allegedly got severely depressed during the shooting and her relationship was volatile (said very mildly) with the \\"enfant terrible\\" director Lars Von Trier, the soundtrack perfectly enhances the movie with its vivid imagination and profound, brave musicianship.<br /><br />The film \\"Dancer In the Dark\\" is often taken either as an eloquent condemnation of capital punishment, or as an ultimate manipulation of the viewer. Either way, Bjork's identification with her character (Czech single mother Selma living in America) gets the best of her as a composer, to the level which she never repeated ever since.<br /><br />The album is in its shorteness (just over half-hour) bookended by instrumental Overture (the simple, but profound composition that earned a Grammy nom) and its vocal reprise \\"A New World\\", emotionally satisfying the viewers who might have been hit hard by the film's denouement.<br /><br />In between, the key scenes of the film (in fact a musical) are expressed - from industrial bang of \\"Cvalda\\" (featuring Catherine Deneuve), to almost Ravelesque (while very Bjorkian) interplays of \\"I've Seen It All\\" (duet with Thom Yorke), \\"Scatterheart\\" (which starts as a lullaby for Selma's ailing son, before changing into an ominously synth-driven wonder of song) and the wildly playful \\"In The Musicals\\".<br /><br />Bjork, orchestrator Vincente Mendoza and the bunch of collaborators have made an album which in a rare fashion improves the experience of the controversial movie. If you are a Bjork fan and loved the movie, the record will certainly belong among the best soundtrack until you keep breathing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to quite the story!  I hope there is a movie for the third book also.  Can't wait to see the 2nd movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So happy they finally have a version for my Kindle fire hd!!! No  i hope i can finally beat level 70 too.
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara do not disappoint in this sassy old retro western. When men were men and women were women this is a great film. Let the good guys win!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I purchased this CD for a couple of songs to listen on the drive into the ROCKIES to go fishing. Blake Shelton NEVER disappoints ... This is a fabulous CD and Blakes sultry tones, as well as that classic country sound made my drive exceptional.  (and catching my limit of amazing trout was second to the CD!)  Thanks Blake, you are quite the talent!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm going to begin my review by saying that I loved Allegiant, not for its perfection, but for it's ability to make me think.  I dislike reviews that contain spoilers, so this one will not.  What I will say is that those of you loved Divergent and Insurgent should not expect Allegiant to be a carbon copy but rather more of a revelation.  If the reader dislikes science or the study of human behavior, or was waiting for nothing more than the culmination of a romance, you'll certainly find fault here.<br /><br />Chapters are divided between Tris' perspective and Tobias'.  I do agree with a previous reviewer that at times it became confusing, but that aside I think it was vital for Ms. Roth to write the book in this manner.  Allegiant is about many things -- strength, weakness, failings, character development, science vs human nature, and the survival or destruction of a society.  Nowhere can this be better understood than being inside the minds of Tris and Tobias, watching their growth, their failures, and their resurgence.  And that could only happen by giving them their own chapters, especially as they saw the unfolding world with sometimes different perspectives.  Separating characters by chapters must be a hard thing to do, but I think this author did a more than passable job. It was only my struggle to keep the chapters straight between Tris and Tobias that kept me from giving Allegiant a rating of 5 stars.<br /><br />I'm told there are rabid Divergent fans out there now who are completely tearing Allegiant apart shades of Kathy Bates character in Misery because they disagree with one particular turn of the story or are unhappy with the ending.  Anyone who truly understands the process of writing knows that characters belong to the author.  They spring from the author, from his or her imagination, from the heart.  Authors are filled with emotion for and commitment to their characters.  They feel every heartache, every wound, every mistake.  The characters in this trilogy were rich and memorable.  Dystopian novels are not meant to end on a particularly happy note.  In fact, the word \\"dystopia\\" means \\"a community or society, usually fictional, that is in some important way undesirable or frightening.\\"  (Wikipedia)  If readers begin a book like this wearing rose colored glasses, they're bound to be unhappy.  There may be other genres more their liking.<br /><br />I found everything about the ending to be right and meaningful.  It ended as it should have, the characters occupying the spaces where they needed to be, where they were destined to be.  Ms. Roth brought the story full circle, answered a myriad of questions, and while it was a very heavy read because of the subject matter, for me it was extremely satisfying because it kept me on my toes.  I love this trilogy, and I was never disappointed, from the first page of Divergent to the last page of Allegiant.  A huge thank you to Veronica Roth for a wonderful experience.  It was quite a ride!trilogy were rich and memorable.  Dystopian novels are not meant to end on a particularly happy note.

B0006GAOCW|5.0|I love this movie. Very fun and romantic. Fairytale enjoyment. Great casting and writing. Great connection between the main characters. Believable.
B00F91FRTO|3.0|My girlfriend had been wanting to see this for a while, but we missed the limited release in the theater, so we watched it via Wii U.<br /><br />The film was alright, but it seems like there wasn't a lot of material for the writers to work with. The setup takes 5 minutes, and then the next 75 or so minutes are all about the desires of flat, vapid, uninspiring California youth.<br /><br />If you're into celebrities and the Hollywood lifestyle, this may be an interesting watch; if not, it's nothing special.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush so much I play it on 2 different names :-) This is the most addicting game I ever played.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1O2NE4D5N6R4U]]We hope you find this review helpful. It's a nice little game that is easy to play yet fun and entertaining. It's made for children but adults will probably enjoy it too.
B0040UAYI4|1.0|I started playing fps's on pc with a mouse and keyboard, but when I switched to PS3 I struggled to aim with a controller.  I was hoping this product would help, but it doesn't even work.  In order to install the firmware, you actually have to have a 32-bit OS. If you have a 64-bit OS the workaround is to install a 32-bit copy of windows on a virtual pc and run the installer off of that. As if everyone has a spare copy of Windows lying around.<br /><br />The fact that they can't even make a 64-bit installer is an absolute joke, and the worst part is they actually expect you to take the time, effort, money, and memory to install a 32-bit OS if you don't have one. Penguin United is a joke of a company and this is a joke of a product.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Phoenix. I can listen to them all day and never get tired of them. Their music puts me in a trance. Buy it.
006202406X|5.0|Do NOT discredit this book based on the bad reviews.  People are upset that it's slower paced and they didn't get the ending they wanted.  That does not mean this book deserves the reviews it is given and I am heartbroken at this fandom for bashing it as so.<br /><br />I absolutely 100% loved this book.<br /><br />Let me explain.<br /><br />Yes it's slower paced than the other two books, which I'm ok with.  We were taking time to explore and learn the world outside Chicago.  That was worth it to me alone cause I was fascinated by what was going outside the faction's world.<br /><br />Did I love how it ended?  No.  Would I have wanted a happy ending for our beloved couple?  Of course!  Am I ok with it?  Yes.  I think it's a nice change of pace from all the other dystopian teen novels out there.  It was a shock to see it happen, it was heartbreaking, but it was totally understandable and called for given the character of our hero.<br /><br />And my biggest thing, regardless if you loved or hates how the story ended, that doesn't chance the fact that the ride was so, so worth it.  It wasn't the closing I wanted for the series, but now that I've read it, I can't imagine it going any other way.  It's a very fitting end to an amazing ride.<br /><br />Also, the few love scenes we were given between Tris and Tobias were very worth it to me as well, and if I had one complaint to give, it'd be that we were given more of them.<br /><br />I cannot wait to see what this author writes after this and look forward to reading her next endeavors.
B003U4ZQUM|3.0|Not sure if it's my fully charged Kindle Fire, or the streaming tech glitches but for the first time, the video was less than stellar, w/ blurry images and sketchy audio. Otherwise, great to be able to catch up with missed episodes.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I admit the description of the game disturbed me a bit. I mean who really wants to wipe out ALL of humanity? I took the chance and downloaded it and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This game is about resource management. In this case it's about managing \\"DNA points\\" rather than gold or cash that is common in other games. The strategy is rather simple for the most part. First infect everyone without being detected, and then, kill 'em all. This is simple in and of itself. The challenge comes when you have to pick and choose what mutations to spend points on. Add to that, that your plague can mutate on it's own and possibly cause you problems because something mutated before you were ready and now you have a challenge. The other hard bit is getting all those pesky little island nations. It's easy if you remain undetected. It just takes time at that point. However, when your plague is detected and sea and air ports start to shutdown, and borders start to close, you better think fast.<br /><br />If you get through the first few levels and think it's too easy just wait... It does get difficult...
B008HTQ28K|2.0|Too implausible  characters too poorly filled out this would be ok if the story was gripping Grisham needs new story ideas stop rehashing old
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret was a fantastic read that I could not put down.  This is the first book I have read by Liana Moriarty but I definitely plan to read more of her books.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|First a disclaimer: I'm a die hard Stephen King fan so I'm a bit biased in his favor.<br /><br />That said, I truly loved the book for the same reason I love all King's writings -- he consistently develops fully-formed human characters in whom the reader is willing to invest and believe.  If there were no plot King's characters would be fun to follow just going about their ordinary business.<br /><br />This book is the long-awaited sequel to The Shining and does not disappoint.  Dan Torrance the adult is a logical and believable extension of Danny Torrance the child and intensely likable.  The young girl in this story is also quite endearing and believable.  Drawing realistic children is one of King's great strengths.  Unlike many other fiction writers King doesn't dumb down kids and drench them in syrup.  They're invested with genuine intelligence, wit, courage and foibles -- which is how children really are.  Before he was a writer Stephen King was a teacher and he's raised his own kids,  No parent can read King and fail to see that he &#34;gets&#34; kids.  An absolute pleasure to see.<br /><br />King also has the good habit of humanizing his villains.  He does so here.  By doing so he renders fully fledged evil characters rather than cardboard cut outs and his bad guys are all the creepier for it.  King understands that bad guys rarely think of themselves as bad guys -- which is part of what makes them bad guys.<br /><br />In summary, another winner from Stephen King.  A real pleasure and highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Not a bad game, but only free up to Level 35.  Lots of better &quot;Candy&quot; related Match 3 games where you don't get only a limited amount of tries before you have to wait a set period of time before you can play again.  In order to get any further, I have to complete 3 quests--but you can only do 1 @ a time and have to wait for 24 hours between each.  Can't see how this game has earned all the &quot;hype&quot; it has!!  Many better games out there that are basically the same but are entirely free -- No bait &amp; switch.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I found this fun and so what of a challenge. I love the escape games thank you very much. Helps pass time in Boring moments.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I've seen almost all the original TV series of Star Trek. This movie was fun because, with a few twists and turns, it tied in multiple episodes. Good acting and, of course, action packed. It's entertaining and I would watch it again...and probably will before my rental expires tomorrow!
0452289963|5.0|This book has been of benefit to everyone I know who has read it. Most recently My 20 year old son.<br /><br />M
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love this movie.  The pop-out window worked great to let me watch the movie while working on other things.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This is one of Steven Kings best. The plot is very simple; 100 teens walk until there is only one left, but the character interaction makes the story a action/adventure. SK wrote this in his early years, when he wrote pure adve.
B00FG5E03W|1.0|This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen and I REALLY wanted to like it. It is shallow, convoluted, not entertaining in the slightest, filled with sex, a british kid with a spunky voice, a teenager that looks like a girl and a man that looks like a giant dou....Every female in this movie looks like they came out of a Nazi Aryan Supremacy propaganda poster with the exception of the token futuristic asian model-wife.<br /><br />A little advice, if you ever hear the line \\"what did people do before sex became obsolete?\\" you know there will be a lot of BS. I wasted $10 on a garbage rental.<br />Unless you are a d-bag college freshman who thinks  he is the smartest person in the universe, a pothead...or both, do yourself a favor and skip it.
B000I55YV2|4.0|Excellent film very different from the original with Michael Caine try that one as well great use of the Mini Cooper
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It has transformed my normal LED tv to a rather smart tv, in fact I believe it is a lot more user friendly than the standards smart tvs that I have seen. the quality is great and you will really get the full hd. It is a really good device when you are playing YouTube videos. could be improved if it worked with other applications such as sky tv, bbc iplayer, itv player etc.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Alex Turner's voice is beautiful and the band together create beautiful music. That's it. This has a bit of a R&B side to it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy its finally available on kindle fire. Works perfectly! Highly recommend. Graphics, sound, everything is of great quality. Being free is all the better!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Ordered this for my partner who loves the character. Arrived day of release. Really great artwork on the case with a slight 3D effect.
B0052REUW0|4.0|This book demonstrates clearly how violence in society has declined overall throughout human history and continues to decline today.  It explains the temporary rise in criminal statistics in the 1960s through the 1980s and how that aberation has corrected itself and the overall decline in violent crime continues to go down not just in the United States (which is NOT the least violent country in the world) but on a global basis, even with all the wars and gennocides that have occured and continue to occur.  If you look at violence in 100 year chunks it declines overall and has for all of recorded history.  He discussess the many factors that play into violence and it's decline.<br /><br />The book is well written and engaging. The only problem is that it is too long and beats each point into the ground with excessive repitition of examples.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|That amazing guys , their songs and lirics always touch my heart! i loved them alll and this last cd/dvd production :)
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Absolutely Great Movie.  I cant wait for Catching Fire to come out in November.  The writers deserve a thumbs up and Jennifer deservesan Oscar.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|What a treat this album is!  Laura Mvula is a very talented artist--a refreshing, original, one-of-a-kind singer.  I have been listening to this album non-stop since it arrived in the mail yesterday--I can't get enough of it!! Happy, happy, happy!  I love everything about her!  Her talent is huge.  She comes from a family of classical musicians, which comes through in all of her songs.  (Her brother plays cello and her sister violin on some of the tracks.)  Her voice is simply amazing, and the way she combines jazz, blues, classical, and African rhythm is truly unique and creative.  The 6-part harmony on some of the songs is out of this world!  I don't understand why anyone would give her less thatn 5 stars.  She deserves 6.  I will be looking forward to many more albums from this wonderful artist.
B00498YZH8|5.0|I loved it.  It was an awesome movie.  And I love Amazon instant video.  Watch this movie when you are looking for and intense great movie.
B00BOLE7X0|4.0|I liked a lot the details and research that was done for this movie. Might feel a bit too heavy for a viewer that hasn't done one's history homework.
0316010669|3.0|Interesting book if you're more interested in anecdotes than statistical analysis. Malcolm Gladwell is a gifted story teller, but he isn't a statistician. Great read, interesting stories, but keep in mind this book isn't a peer-reviewed scientific study.
1609611543|5.0|Great Book... Makes a whole lot of sense!!! I've enjoyed the recipes in the back of the book....Very Tasty... Will be trying to go more gluten free as life goes on!
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Amazing but creepy, normally don't get creeped out easy. But overall great movie!!! I've watched it multiple times! Definitely a must watch
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|IT SOMETIMES GETS RID OF THE ITCH...I like the challenge to collect the forearms, and shoot different guns. It is as close as it gets with a tablet.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|We just love this album, what a joy to listen to a great British group such as coldplay. We enjoy their music tremendously.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|I kind of the liked this movie and went into it with the understanding of a world meets monsters  the good guyswill prevail and a happy ending got all so I am happy
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game it I  addicting and challenging. DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!! It you don't you are crazy. Love it so much.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game brings out the best in my creative thinking. Everyone should get this game. Woot woot!! This game is the best!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addicting. It would be nice if it didn't take so long for lives to replenish. Wish there were more games like this one
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Very clever and intriguing the whole way through. Easy to pick up and put down over a holiday. Would recommend.
1451626096|3.0|Though still a great read for her fans, this does seem to be the most repetitive of her narratives. Elizabeth comes across as stone-cold stupid, repeating everything people say to her and seeming constantly surprised by events that should be no surprise whatsoever. Since Gregory writes historical fiction, I support the author in choosing whatever version of events that she wants to believe...Perkin being the long-lost brother, Elizabeth loving Richard. I understand that none off us will know the truth. But then...why not make her version of events supremely interesting? Because this book is not the shocking page-turner that her others are. But I look forward to her next work nonetheless.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|This movie is a classic and anyone who loves movies must see it. The casting is brilliant and the script is brilliant. You are constantly laughing aloud. That being said, you may not want to watch this in public.
B007TK77QE|1.0|Extremely boring. Life situations that have already been talked about millions of times. I appreciate the spoonriver-style attempt but the result is a bit poor.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This book is really something I loved. I will look after other books of this writer!<br />The storry  is well written in a way that you from time to time thinks you think to know really<br />shure who it was and until the end well your very wrong.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This one keeps you going back for more. It really makes you think. I wished you could get more levels for a free game. Might think of buying this one it so good
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome book best in the series!! There's a ton of action and percy and anabeth goes crazy on some titans
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Quite a different take on Bejewelled!  Some of the levels are hard and you use up all your lives in no time flat.
B00BV5FVR0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I went back and reread all of the series from oryx  and crake onwards. I like Atwoods version of our future, her sense of humour, her wisdom. I would recommend this book to any reader of intelligence.
B000T00PE2|5.0|I was looking for something different to listen to and I found it in Massive Attack.  Normally, I listen to classic rock-type stuff and I was getting bored.  Massive Attack was a great change of pace.  In my search, I recalled hearing the song &#34;Angel&#34; in the film &#34;Flight of the Phoenix&#34; and thought about how much I enjoyed the song.  I did some research and found &#34;Mezzanine.&#34;  Needless to say, Massive Attack is all I've listened to in the past couple of weeks.<br /><br />What I find so interesting about Massive Attack is their penchant for using repetitive beats.  Normally that might get boring, but Massive Attack weaves those beats into haunting, dark, and eerie melodies.  The resulting music is beautiful and even slightly-chilling.  I've taken the time to listen to several of Massive Attack's albums, thanks to Spotify, and I feel like &#34;Mezzanine&#34; is their best to date.<br /><br />My favorite songs on the album are &#34;Angel,&#34; &#34;Teardrops,&#34; &#34;Exchange,&#34; &#34;Inertia Creeps,&#34; and &#34;Black Milk.&#34;  &#34;Mezzanine&#34; is such a brilliant, cohesive grouping of some amazing songs.  I highly recommend it for someone who is tired of the status quo of music and is looking for something different.  Enjoy!
0385351399|4.0|Page-turner about a Google-esque company that connects EVERYTHING.  Couldn't tell if the author meant this as a satire or a warning.  Probably both!  As usual, his writing sucked me in.  Still not sure if I want to give this one three or four stars.
0062225790|2.0|It was banal on every level.  I bought the book because of who he is, plus I saw him on Bill Mauer.  I feel hoodwinked. I will not buy anymore of his books.  I'll pray for him instead.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Like others who commented that if you read the first chapter, I was. This is an extremely engaging story. I really don't know what lead me to purchase it initially, but sure am glad I did.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I have totally enjoyed this book the series has kept me reading way into the late hours finding it hard to put down. The author has done an excellent job all the characters have an I interesting story.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked the pace of the book but cared little about the characters. The resolutions were not believable or acceptable.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I LIKE FACEBOOK BECAUSE I STAY CONNECTED TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I LOVE SHARING PICTURES WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Ok I I removed kik of of my kindle fire and tried to put it back on but it says currently unavailable what do I do
B005LAII4E|4.0|Arrived in great condition, packaged just right<br />Just as promised, great value for the $$$<br />Worth the wait, liked it
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Better than expected and nice that it has a comedy flair to it even though it's an action flick. Great movie and great cast.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I loved this book it is  a thriller novel about a girl fighting for not only her life but her friends and family too.<br /> She is illegal along with many others who aren't supposed to exist. They have become too much for the government to refuse to ignore so they have to fight to fight back. I highly recommend reading them in order to under stand the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just be sure the parent controls are on or you may get lots of extra charges.  Great game.  My daughter loves it and now I'm playing too.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I admire Grisham's success and recognize that he is hugely popular .  I think he is brilliant at plot concept and intertwining legal issues with human actions.  I personally just don't care for the way he puts his words to paper.  He leaves too many plot holes.  Admittedly, I am the minority, but will put my two cents in for balance.<br />Returning to \\"Time To Kill\\"'s hometown and characters, Jake Brigance defends the last minute, handwritten will of a cranky, reclusive millionaire (Seth) who inexplicably leaves twenty million bucks to Letty, his timid black maid, voiding his previous will and cutting off his adult children.  He then hangs himself from a sycamore tree. The plot hangs on \\"why\\" he did it but Jake's case hangs on proving only that Seth was fully cognizant and in control of his actions.  Everybody \\"lawyers up\\" and the blood suckers arrive in force. Even Jake, after several dry years, relishes the hourly fees. The judge in charge is honorable yet leans towards a settlement despite Seth's admonition to Jake that the kids get nothing.<br />Jake recognizes that finding the nexus between Letty and Seth is crucial, but even Letty is astounded at the bequest and overwhelmed by the attention and scrutiny.<br />In \\"TTK\\", I could not see the outcome, so despite my dislike of Grisham's writing style, I was driven to the finale. ( By the way, does anyone else see any similarities between \\"Time to Kill\\" and \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" plot and characters?) However, \\"Sycamore\\"'s ending is fully obvious to me from the get-go, which made it a slog to the end.  One big plot hole: why didn't Sam just call up his fancy law firm and have them change the will rather than leave a mess behind that might circumvent his wishes??? Seth had already liquidated all his holdings so why didn't he just put it all in a checking account for Letty before his demise?  Grisham needed to address these plot holes so they don't distract me.<br />The entertainment value for me was just some mentalexercises on some of the issues Grisham raises in the plot.  Should the Court be attempting to sway a settlement even though Seth was clear on his wishes to cut out his kids?  Should lawyers get such free rein to drag out the work on estate cases, thereby fattening their purses?  Do old people have the right to serendipitous bequests or even bad decisions without being deemed unstable or incapacitated?  (Was the old guy who left Anna Nicole millions crazy or just looking to wring the last bit of fun out of his decrepit life?)<br />Harper Lee wrote a beautiful book and wrote beautifully but then quit. Scott Turow is a writing craftsman and has penned one or two brilliant plots (\\"Presumed Innocent\\" is an all time favorite), however, he just doesn't seem to have as many ideas as Grisham.  If only I could wrap them all up in one writer!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game runs out of lives, which of course you can purchase, but there is no definition of how many you get...have or ...had. It's fun and addictive, but beware of lost lives. They'll cost ya!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I did not think I would like this app, but unfortunately, I am addicted. My brain does not work this way - I am good with word games, but I struggle with this. I am hoping to retrain my brain while working through the puzzles. A lot of fun for down time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this game is finally here...been waiting to see what people are talking  all and I'm happy...thank you so much
B00571F26Y|5.0|EYE OPENING INFORMATION. This book explains the cause of so many ailments.... All attributed to wheat and gluten. I highly recommend it.
B0029Z7Y2G|5.0|loved the entire series. I wouldn't purchase a digital only copy again, but a blu-ray or DVD combo. Good if you don't have a player and only watch online
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Inception Blew me AWAY! you must watch this movie, and you will probably have to watch it a few times and you might question reality for a while. lol
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I find I make more time to read if its on an E-reader, Laptop, or a Kindle. I dont own the Nook.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have always been a big fan of John Grisham.  He is the best at legal novels.  This one took a look at the less pleasant side of two bit lawyers.  Mr. Grisham was able to tell a story that warmed my heart.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|The film is hard to watch, but worth it. Fabulous acting by Ellen Burstyn. All of the actors are wonderful. Very sad story and I had to close my eyes in one scene. This director's cut was better than what I saw when I watched this years ago. Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fun read!  I read the other reviews that said they were upset with the ending.  I think it didn't bother me in part because I knew it might not be as good.  I would certainly recommend this book to others.
0385351399|1.0|I agree with another reviewer that the story is highly promising but is handled in an amateur way by the author. Stop here if you are still planning to read the book (spoiler alert!). So someone who has created this evil empire called Circus oops Circle, has unrestricted access to the entire campus and the secret hidden caves on the campus, can do nothing but run after a brainless girl to stop the Circle from completing? I am no author but I can think of at least one way that Ty could have used his phenomenal intellect and Mae's mad attraction to him to mold Mae into his own weapon against this evil empire. Throughout the story it is clear to everyone but the greatest genius of social media where Mae's loyalty is. A better author would have made this into a great contemporary techno-thriller.
B001AITH50|3.0|Banderos and Pitt leave you wanting something more.  Cruise and Dunst shine, they really turn it on.  You actually see Cruise being a character, instead of Cruise being Cruise.  Dunst nails it even though she is very young in the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is the best!  I think everyone should get this app!!! It is good for adults and children. I love minion rush!!!!!!!!:-)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the greatest mlp game ive played yet on the android. ive gotta say they're used to be a lot of problems with this game but it seems they fixed pretty much every thing that bothered me so...perfect game 5 out of 5
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|The game didn't even download. It looked like a great game. It told me I needed to erase more apps to install and make space and that didn't even work. Ian really mad. I erased every app and it still did not work. Now Jam having to reinstall every app. :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that this game gradually raises the challenge per each section.  I wish more games were set up this way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I never post reviews but I get such a kick out of this game. I play it while listening to audio books
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when they added this for kindle.  All my friends play and I had felt left out.  Thank you Amazon.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|So very predictable....Sad, but boring.....I was able to finish many, many sentences half way through...I didn't learn anything new...I always want to take away something new and enlightening.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Makes you think, never really put two and two together that in a major problem the Government will be over powered, meaning can't help everyone like in New Orleans after the<br /> hurricane.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I have had fun with this game played through at least 3 time so far and am still entertained<br />thankyou
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I have loved RHPS since I first saw it in the early 80s. It is a fun movie best seen with a bunch of people. The story is Brad Major and Janet Weiss get engaged. They drive down a dark deserted road and get a flat tire. They decide to go to the castle they just pasted to use the phone... Everyone knows castles don't have phones. The fun starts from there. The movie has fun songs ,sex , aliens and cannibalism....
B004SBQGHS|2.0|its now asking to be connected to Internet.......I only connect my kindle to Internet to update cause I don't want my 4yr old to go messing on the Internet.....I have this game 2yrs and now is the time u guys want Internet....come on that stupid

B00475AYJQ|4.0|A great piece. Leaves you completely psyched for the third chapter of the trilogy. Kvothe is a total bad-ass and one of my favorite characters of all time.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Excellent source of little known facts on history.  Bryson does his research and presents it  in lively prose.  Even a history major can learn from this book.  I know I did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks so much for finally getting this game.  All my friends play it and I can see why - it's a fun game.
B0063M22QO|3.0|The Mahjong game was only a three as I didn't find it very challenging.  The color was good and it passed the time easily.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think the app is really awesome you get to take care of your horse and compete in competitions and play games with your horse
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun and addictive. Easy to learn and progress.  Been playing for two weeks now and continue to progress for free.  Just takes a bit of time.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best book I have read in 30 years. I am a voracious reader, and was hooked from page 1. The detail, the research, the emotion, nothing can compare.  I will gift this book either by e-books or hard cover to all my family and friends. I was sad to get to the end, which is testament enough.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|David and Goliath is the latest in a series of amazing books by Malcolm Gladwell.  In it, he investigates strategies of underdogs, and how they often succeed against overwhelming odds.  He also looks at &#34;the inverted U curve&#34; and how it describes the ultimate failure of power to accomplish its goals.  A must for every thinking reader!<br /><br />The Kindle edition was very clear and charts easy to read and follow.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It fun to have friends an family challenges.  My kids enjoy learning matching / sequance patterns.  Fun all the way around.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Not what I was expecting But was still a good movie. Not fond of Kevin Bacon. Other than him Id watch again but not buy.
B009VMLSHC|5.0|One of our favorite movies.  We watch it almost 3x a month!  We have even given it to family as a gift ;)
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Find their articles interesting.  Like the format.  Find myself reading things I would not otherwise.  I appreciate the quality of the articles ... and variety.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|Everyone wants $45 for this toy or more because it is so hard to get. They must have released it a while ago before Octonauts was big in the USA and then stopped producing them. Normally this toy is $19.99 but I had to have it for my daughter because it was the only one we were missing. Its going to be her favorite. Is just as described and came new in the box. Also shipping stated it was going to take almost two months to get to us and it took about 2/3 weeks. We love it  =)

B0028MBKVG|4.0|I loved the stores about the runners and races. I found some of the science and history a little too long and I found myself skipping parts to get back to the races.
B0000073I5|3.0|It is best to be cautious about Genesis solo albums (other than Phil and Peter). Many of them feature guest vocalists who get buried beneath layers and layers and layers of instrumentation. &#34;A Curious Feeling&#34; from Tony Banks in 1979 is definitive for such works, Hackett was not entirely innocent (but all praise to 'Please don't touch') and, unfortunately &#34;Smallcreeps Day&#34; is another such affair.<br /><br />I believe Noel McCalla is a very good singer. He's an afro-dude and sings like a soul-singer, which actually makes him a perfect match with Rutherfords' funky prog-pop.<br /><br />One thing: If Rutherford gave McCalla's vocals the same prominence in the mix as he gave his OWN VOCALS on 1982's Acting Very Strange, this SHOULD (not would) be a 4-star masterpiece, maybe, possibly, 4.5 stars.<br /><br />As it is, on many of these tracks, the vocals struggle to reach beyond the level of Anthony Phillips' 'Banksynths' and Rutherford's bumping bass, as well as the other instruments.<br /><br />There are some tracks where the vocals get to shine, particularly the irresistible &#34;Overnight Job&#34;, the folky-bouncy &#34;Working in line&#34; and the dubbed-vocals ballad &#34;Every Road&#34;.<br /><br />Did I mention Anthony Phillips and his &#34;Banksynths&#34;? Actually, he does a wonderful job of making the keyboards as illuminating and as interesting as possible. This adds a great 'atmosphere' to the album.<br /><br />The unique songwriting, that aforementioned atmosphere, the passionate vocals all add up to a great album. With better mixing/production it might have reached beyond the three star rating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for bringing DVD to Kindle.  It is a game all family members can play.  LOVE all the different challenges.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I tore through it! It was thought provoking and sad. I plan on telling all my friends to check it out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Its like reading a great book every week, but having to wait for the next chapter! Love it!! The characters are amazing, and so beautifully acted! And the sets and scenery are a perfect backdrop!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app saves a ton of time by correcting<br />mistakes and accurately guessing the words you're typing just by swiping your finger to the appropriate keys.<br /><br />One thing I think is a bit misleading is that it identifies how many words it's corrected for you. I don't believe this takes into account the words it gets wrong and you have to go back and correct but it's still a 5-star-worthy app nonetheless.
B00915G6MG|5.0|shipment came through fine and on time, have not had a chance to view yet- but since it was new - not worried
B003F3FJQO|3.0|This book never failed to surprise me. The adventure continues with crazy zombie like people called Cranks. This is a great book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is a great game. Challenging and fun. Sometimes frustrating when I miss some moves but eventually get it.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Great depth and originality in the song writing. I will be looking to buy any other Ray L music out there. 5 stars
B00F8LPH90|5.0|While this game has in game purchases for upgrades, it does allow you to advance quickly without such purchases.<br /><br />PROS: Fun to play to the point of addiction.<br />CONS: such addiction can lead to severe sleep deprivation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG Candy Crush Saga is the BEST game ever.<br />I play it all the time . Now all my buff play.
B002ZG98ZA|4.0|This movie was a gift for my girlfriend... she loves this movie and there was nothing wrong with the merchandise when recieved
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book is… to put it plainly, a mess. Roth is so busy lecturing and trying to cram in more plot points that never seem to fit together she forgets there are characters we are supposed to be invested in. This book is about as interesting as a grocery list, and 90% of the character's actions read like lists. It goes in circles over and over, and fails to ever develop anything meaningful beyond a regurgitation of the same type of events that have already happened in book 2. More serums! More factions! Really, the first half of the book should have been the entirety of the story, leading up to the **spoiler** escapes and truth and finding a place in the big new world or deciding to go back and fix the one they had. That was enough. That would have made sense and been a story arc I could care about.<br /><br />I know I'm not the first to mention it, either, but the ending is ludicrous. If I hadn't been waiting over a year for this book, I would have been laughing halfway through at how bad it was. This book needed a real editor like whoa. Not to mention **spoiler** eventually, when all but, what, two people you started following in book 1 are dead, do you really still care what happens to anyone in the end? Honestly, by the end, I felt like the kindest thing that could happen to these people was a direct hit from an asteroid. It would have made as much sense as the rest of this book and it would have stopped their pain and mine. The reviewer who said Roth seems to lack understanding of the line between morbid and realistic was dead on. This book is past morbid, really, and into pedantic, pour peroxide in your wounds and chase it with salt. It isn't even believable, in the end, the character arc for the one surviving lead. I don't believe, for a minute, the character we have followed for these thousands of pages would have wound up where they did. If that was the important message, Roth chose the wrong survivor.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was going to write out a longer review, but I'll instead just list some things that could have been improved:<br /><br />1. No chemistry between the two main district 12 team 'star crossed lovers.'  I realize that was part of a lie they made up to get sponsors, but what about the boyfriend left back at home?  I kept wanting to focus on Catness, but couldn't, because of the whole 'teammate' thing getting in the way of the plot.<br /><br />2. Fully half the combatants perished in the first few minutes of the event - I was hoping to see each and every one picked off over a period of time.  Major let down for me, as I was relishing a much deeper tactical situation for all participants.  AND, we didn't get to see how they died (there was some tussling and knives, but it was over in a few seconds).<br /><br />3. Took too long to get to the point.  The film was half over before the hunger games began.<br /><br />4. No 'replays' shown from the point of view inside the city - the blue haired guy could have shown things from different angles for effect - &#34;now watch how district 8 takes out the last of district 6!&#34;  - would have added a dark and eerie air to the film. I.E., the one time I *did* want to see the city point of view of the fight, we got nothing.<br /><br />5. Despite Catness's accuracy with her bow, for her to to only shoot one person with it was a huge letdown.  She had at least three other opportunities to take out enemies with it, and she passed on them all.  Why? (and I realize she would never hurt Rue or her teammate- 3 other opportunities besides this)<br /><br />6. For the judges to change the rules of the game at a moments notice, TWICE, damaged the plot and made the film less believable IMHO.<br /><br />Despite all the above, the film was very well acted, the plot overall was very good, and the story original.  Certainly worth watching.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I found getting used to the characters and the parts they played in the story a little difficult in the beginning. Once I grasped who was who and where they fit in I was totally hooked. This story line reminded me of the movie '13 Conversations About One Thing'. Enjoy!
B00FX8F6VM|5.0|This is a great song and has a nice beat(trap)! Bazooka bass tube banging out the bass in this song.
B00E9E4EC8|2.0|I like Alan Jackson, but this was not Bluegrass.  They had the banjoes' but not Bluegrass.  Just not up to his best.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Oh I LOVE John Grisham! This book is a page turning suspense and \\"who done it.\\" I have read all of this author's books and he never disappoints. Can't wait to read his newest book which I pre-ordered and has just arrived! The racketeer starts with a guy in jail who knows who has killed a Federal Judge. He is bargaining with the FBI for his release. The story builds as he begins to reveal the details of the crime. Recommended to Murder Mystery people who love the legal world.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|No thread left hanging. Thank you thank you thank you for this amazing and strong conclusion to the series. We too, shall be mended.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is my go to app for editing. so many options and my pictures always come out looking great. I would recommend this app!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I learned nothing new, since I've read it all before. I really was hoping for additional information but was disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I can't believe she chose that ending. She ruined a really good series and I don't care what good it did for the other characters.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I haven't read a book in a long time that kept me so enthralled. The reader uncovers the protagonist's life alongside the protagonist, and wonders, what part is truth, what part imagination, what part deceit? The only disappointment was the ending, as I wanted to know, definitively and without any doubt, what tomorrow would bring. Readers who do not like their books tied up with a bright red bow at the end will enjoy that the end is left to the reader to decide. Overall, I highly recommend this book!
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Gorgeous settings - amazing clothes - stupid rich people and down-to-earth regular folks - what's not to love about this show??  So glad I bought both seasons, as I am certain to be watching it again a few years down the road when I need a vengeance &#34;fix&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! I have all the editions of minecraft... but this is great for on-the-go gaming! Just buy it already!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|He's been on for several seasons now - who can resist the charm, quirkiness, and intellect of Patrick Jane?!?  This is such a great show, and for those of us who have eschewed most of TV/cable for its awfulness, this makes me glad we still have that big screen in the living room!  Love the characters and their interpersonal relationships, and Simon Baker is irresistible.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game! I'm so glad that it is finally available for the kindle.  The kids really enjoy this game too.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Like most movies today, if you haven't read the book beforehand you'll easily find yourself lost and wondering &#34;why?&#34; certain things happen, and why so many loose ends seem to be hanging out there.  The movie is entertaining in its own right, but for the best experience:  Read the BOOK
B000SEFNMS|3.0|I  Still don't see the reason for his attitude with his parents.<br />They seemed quiet Craig and loving parents.<br />I think he was a rebel for the wrong reasons.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|It was slow compared to the previous releases.  The humor just wasn't as good.  Neither my wife or myself thought it<br />was a great movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book. TV series  is good but not like the book. Of course you have to like Sci Fi and blood and guts. Very emotionally charged book.
1250038820|5.0|I've been following Brandon and HONY for well over a year now and was beyond happy when he announced his book. From the moment I opened it up, it did not disappoint. Each page and story more beautiful and touching then the last. I think it takes a special type of person to approach a complete stranger and get them to open up with the most personal stories and then capture stunning portraits of them.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book. It's so much more then a coffee table book, it's a conversation piece!<br /><br />Keep up the good work Brandon and I hope to see HONY v.2 in a few years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's amazing and very addicting haha well i still have some words i have to write so im just effing around now lol i think thats enough... have a good day
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I have read a lot of criticisms of this film from fans and stars alike. I have to say, I can't exactly see where they are coming from.<br />I found this film to be very engaging, an excellent follow up to the first incarnation of JJ Abrams watch.<br />Right from the get go the latest Enterprise crew pull you in for the ride into darkness. The performances are great, with the exception of Benedict Cumberbatch who is, simply put, exceptional. What an incredible performance. His poise and presence are striking - a chilling menace indeed!<br />This movie is filled with action from the get go, as you might expect, and while much of this is edge of the seat excitement, you do miss the dialog, and character development that JJ's previous outing gave us.<br />Case in point is Doctor Marcus.<br />Alice Eve is not given nearly enough, considering there was so much that she should have been given considering her role in relation to the other characters. This was very disappointing, and one can't help but feel there was much that could have been sacrificed in order to add what was so glaringly missing.<br />What was added for Alice was a strip to the undies, and as has been widely commented on this is entirely unnecessary.  It did however last but a few seconds, and is certainly not worthy of the slew of complaints, and was almost a nod to the original series, and it's cheekiness!<br />That said this movie is full of excitement and swashbuckling fun. There are plenty of tense moments to keep you on the edge of your seat, along with heart wrenching scenes - This film left me feeling exhausted, but at the same time desperate to see what is in store for the crew of the enterprise next time around.<br />One further note. I watched this in 3D at the cinema, and both 2 and 3D at home. While much of the movie is great in 3D, at other times it is simply irritating, and whenever that happens I waste time thinking about the 3D being unnecessary rather than enjoying the movie.A small complaint as I personally love the format!<br />Bottom line, if you like adventure movies, exciting movies, watch this film, you will enjoy it. If you are going to sit and over-Analise every scene, perhaps not so much! If you thought JJ's first Star Trek Movie was the bee's knees, you'll love this movie. It may not be as good as his first, but it is 2 hours well spent!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is SO EPIC I would WANT to play it allllllllll day if I had to!!!!!!!XD I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!
B004PJG7MW|5.0|Hilarious movie. My 7 yr old and 9 yr old loved it as it my husband and I. There is some cursing but nothing too bad. Great flic
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like this app, no matter where I am I can check the weather for anywhere in the country.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is a perfect ending to a very amazing trilogy. Definitely a good trilogy to add to any book collection.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This app makes it easy to check the local weather or view the weather at other locations quickly without having to call up the National Weather Service's website and searching for the location.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|What a great sequel. Took me back years and tied up the loose ends. A must read for The Shining fans.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|THis app on my Kindle gives me a handy clock and alarm when I am traveling or want a backup alarm for important wake ups.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I really like the game. However they don't give you enough acorns. Some of the animals require them to be paired up with a mate. And there should be more ways to win them. And why does it cost so gosh darn much to expand your village?  Every time you expand the price gets higher. Don't like that, I guess it's like buying real property.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie.  I find it amazing that the stars did not believe they were making that good of a film.
B00DUPU5BQ|4.0|Hey, Hey, We're the Black Crowes<br />And we're going to crow it out loud.<br />And make the follow up album.<br />To the Southern Harmony and Musical Companion.<br /><br />Probably.<br /><br />King Troll he say: BUY OR DON'T, YOU MUST CHOOSE BROTHERS, YOU MUST CHOOSE!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Having the BBC News available on my Kindle is extremely handy.  I enjoy its worldwide news coverage which is often ahead of the US news reporting by days.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really like this game. I like that it's not a short game with only a few level. What keeps me from giving it a five star review is that it keeps forcing you to send request after request to your friends to get to the next level. I've had people get upset because they get game requests on Facebook. I'm not playing a game to upset so called friends.
B007EC27QM|4.0|It is very handy having a basic calculator available instantly on my Kindle.  I rarely use it, but it is easy to use and access when I need a quick answer to a math problem.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was a great book and it really had me guessing a lot. I admit, I did cry at the end and it was super sad but that's one reason why it's a really good book. Any book that makes you cry (in my opinion) is a great book because the author made it seem so real that it makes you sad. When Tris got shot I was in shock even though I had already read like a million spoilers it was still like O.o ?!?!?!!!!!! But the whole book was amazing, the plot, writing and everything else I can't think of right now. It still surprises me how many people hated it the ending so much BECAUSE IT'S SAD that they have it terrible reviews. I mean, don't even read the book if you don't expect it to be sad. I guess that makes me a hypocrite because I didn't expect it to be THAT sad but I don't think that makes it a terrible book. It doesn't make Veronica Roth evil either. Dear anyone who didn't enjoy reading this book, I think you're trying to read it upside down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game challenging and fun<br />Love it great for kids a adult, great past time, no dough a minion world and mine loooooooooooove these game!!!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Not too much harsh language . Kept me entertained . Few explicit bedroom scenes. We'll written .
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have never played a game like this one....I'm loving it.....it is so much fun....makes you thank.....but gives you plenty of help.....for when your thinker is not working.....very addictive....hours of fun and its free.....!
B0018OIK0E|5.0|My son was dying to see a zombie movie, ha ha.  I am squeamish, and Shaun of the Dead is so funny that I was able to sit through most of it.  I enjoy being able to share in a family tradition, and my age is showing by choosing this undead movie over newer ones. The language is filthy, which for British comedy adds to the humor.  Now my son is constantly saying &#34; sorry Mom&#34; then waiting for me to detect the fart smell, just like the room mate does in Shaun of the Dead
1936608898|5.0|It all started in the hospital. I was having bouts of unexplained dizziness, and no one could find a reason. A Neurology Nurse Practitioner came into my room and started asking me the weirdest questions: How was I sleeping? What was I eating? No one else had asked this. I explained that I had recently stopped eating wheat and gluten grains. She smiled and said \\"When you get out of here, check out the book \\"It Starts With Food\\". Two days after discharge (turns out the spells were due to low blood sugar and hormonal fluctuations), I ordered the book for my Nook. And that's when my life changed. It really does all start with food. Within a week of reading the book, I started my first Whole 30. It wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. The results? Cholesterol numbers dropped over 40 points. Blood sugar spikes and dips almost completely disappeared. Hot flashes and other hormone-related issues almost disappeared. Full night's sleeps for the first time in years. Almost NO fibromyalgia flares. And over 20lbs lost. But the most amazing thing? I recently had a colonoscopy to check the progress of my Chronic Ulcerative Colitis. The result? No inflammation present. At ALL. After more than 15 years, I no longer have ANY sign of colitis. At ALL. I've given copies of this book to friends and family, and to my PCP. It really has changed not only my health, but my life.
006202406X|5.0|SPOILER ALERT<br />Ok, so enough with the hate. Lets face the fact that TRIS IS DEAD! She isn't coming back! But to be real, all you 1 star haters, admit you cried please! And if you cried that means it was very well written, which it was. Hating Veronica doesn't change anything. TRIS IS STILL DEAD! Want proof? Read the book again, because its in paper, in your hands now. No going back. This book was beautiful and heart breaking. The fact that Tris sacrifices herself shows that blood can come before faction. Face it, please. Tris is dead, but will not be forgotten.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Redemption code for UltraViolet Digital Copy was &#34;not valid in your country&#34;. I live in the USA.  (Offer supposedly valid until 12/31/2014.) I guess Sony Pictures shipped the DVD from their warehouse in Lower Slobbovia?<br /><br />The movie was excellent, but I did not receive all that I paid for.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Great story with a really detailed plot and we'll developed characters. I can't wait to read the next book and hope it's just as good
0811875040|1.0|I was excited to get this book after the publisher sent me the \\"corrected\\" version. I made the chocolate cake today, using two countour pans exactly like the ones she sells on her site, and they are overflowing and smoking up my kitchen. I am a very experienced baker and it looked like too much batter for the pans, but I thought, no, this is the corrected book, so I forged ahead.<br /><br />I don't get why someone would go to market with a book that makes people question the publisher and the author. What a waste.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Good movie, a little long but keeps you in the movie and the story mixed with some good acting makes the movie go by faster
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked the journey of breaking and building a commander.<br />Since the story is mostly from Ender's point of view we only experience a small view. The story wraps up too neatly I expect the rest of the series goes into the aftermath. That I expect is where the real story lies. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
B001BANK32|5.0|i loved it the first time, i loved it the second time. i loved it the third time.  so i thought i should read it again before i started reading dr sleep.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I'm not sure john Grisham can write a bad book!!! Love all his books, can't wait to read more in Theordore!!
B00DJ735KI|2.0|This book is not a must read. If one is strongly seeking solutions to thinking problems and how to overcome it will not be of great help.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally get to see what all the hype is about..very addictive<br /><br />Also very frustrating..makes one think..only wish u could have more lives without paying..i do not think one should have to pay to play.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I didn't want it to end!! It is so clever and hilarious- a real page turner. I can read it over and over again! It's such a shame that the author wasn't able to finish the whole set. I would love to know what would happen next!!
B005PK553C|5.0|Awesome! What a cool story! I couldn't stop watching! I just started watching it this year 2103, and had to go back to see the first one.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|and this fulfilled the need! It was very good, I enjoyed the changes from when Alice was younger :)<br />very colorful and full of innuendos.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever!!!!! just don't want to run out of levels :(<br />hope they make more, 500 is not enough.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Great game!!!!! Game does mess up from time to time and when you msg help desk all they say is sorry.....they rarely ever give you your credits back....credits are very high priced. I only play with daily credits but want to play more!!! :-) however I will NOT spend that much on a game/app.....
0307463745|1.0|Short trite shallow maxims presented as the single right approach, the smart move, the way to succeed without effort. The front fly leaf says:\\"... shows you a better, easier way to succeed in business\\" reminds me of those late night exercise machine ads that promise effortless weight loss.<br /><br />If you believe those late night infomercials, you will love this book.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I've heard so many people talking about this game lately, so when it finally became available on the Kindle Fire I was excited to give it a try. I just downloaded it &amp; played it until my &quot;lives&quot; ran out, so it was plenty of time to see, that it's really not all that it's cracked up to be. Just sayin. Now, I know a lot of ppl will disagree with me, so you'll just have to take the 2 seconds &amp; download it for yourself. ***On another note, they shouldn't make u wait 30mins for &quot;lives&quot; that's ridiculous. But I guess they need to make their money somehow &amp; that's how they chose:(
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|little to much sex for me, but love the piano playing, and the views of the house are beautiful, would watch again
B005K17RU0|4.0|I would like to see more about winds and other links to better track storms. Also would like to see more about atmospheric anomalies.
B003B02O0A|5.0|As all of this author's books, this was completely absorbing.  The emotions are so real an raw.  The reality is scary.  Great book.
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. Atwood is brilliant, creative. Oryx & Crake and Year of the Flood were haunting& provocative, but MaddAdam lacks the same longevity. I am glad to have learned more about the Crakers, Zeb, Toby. I am glad to know what happened to Jimmy & Adam One. But I found myself more amused than compelled by the trilogy's conclusion. A must-read with fans of the first two books, but unable to stand alone. Overall, an enjoyable read, but lacks the staying power of the 1st two.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I own 2 of the chromecast devices. the concept and the supposed ease of use are great, your TV becomes an extension of your chrome browser which means that everything thats on the internet could be viewed on your TV.<br />The problem is that device has a lot of issues staying connected on the network when used on the chrome browser and it messes up the wifi connection for all the devices in my experience this happens only if you cast from your chrome browser and not if you cast the few [but expending number of]apps available for the phone and tablet. This issue renders it quite impractical for chrome browser streaming but the growing number of app with casting ability are making this less of niche device and increasingly viable streaming option from phone/tablet to the home theater system.
B00FN8HS5O|5.0|Not exactly what I would consider to be a \\"classic\\" movie score, but sweet jeebus this score took a fantastic movie and made it absolutely incredible.  It's very difficult to put into words how the score all smashes together (and yes, it's a very \\"violent\\" score).<br /><br />First, there's usually a layer of ambient sound effects sitting in the back.  It sounds like an HF radio being tuned, with the static buzz and the high pitch swing as signals move past the tuning frequency.  It really makes one feel alone.  This shows up in \\"Don't Let Go\\", in particular, and makes for a sweet, sad, lonely tune during the slow sections.<br /><br />And then there's the heart pounding, \\"oh crap oh crap oh crap oh crap oh crap\\" moments, which don't really have any sort of melody or theme to go with them, like in \\"Fire\\".  It's synthesized orchestra, very similar to \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Dark Knight Rises\\".  It's music, but it's not music.  Either way, there's plenty of layers for ears to latch onto.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|LOVED the movie Paul, so purchased this one and Shaun of the Dead.  This movie had it's amusing segments and it did get better as it got going.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|First 50% of the book is slow and somewhat muddled as it explains the genetics and history. If you can bare with it, the emotion is found in the last few chapters.8
B0018OIK0E|1.0|I LOVED Paul and thought I would give this movie a try.  I have watched Paul quite a few times and find it even more amusing each time as I uncover more funny details.  Wow, what a difference, with Shaun of the Dead; I truly wish I could find something good to say.  I forced myself to watch the entire movie thinking it would get better somehow.  It was just really, really bad in my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an amazing game. I enjoy the challenge of getting to the next level. I also like linking io with people on facebook.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Great movie for a rainy day or dark, cold night!!!  Truly scary!!!  Enjoyed every minute of this movie.  Don't go in the cellar alone!!!
0307887448|2.0|Do you long to bring your massive multi-player online role-playing game back to your 1980's high school years; to relive your adolescence with not only the tech gadgets of today but those of 2044? Then, this is the novel for you.<br /><br />Nostalgia for coin-operated video games and 80's teen films is not enough to make this a good novel. The writer's style is too flat and featureless to sustain interest. The plot is average. Mr. Cline uses obvious contrivances to add suspense, and these mostly fail.<br /><br />I can see where this novel may have appeal to a segment of the novel-reading population, but it's great popularity is the biggest mystery this book has to offer.<br /><br />Recommended: No
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Love watching movies where they overcome their financial situations, great movie. It shows that you should go with your heart. I love these English movies, they are so moving.
0547260695|5.0|First purchase from Amazon and it was fuss-free, delivered ahead of time and packed in the right way...No damage, securely wrapped! Couldn't be more pleased with the service!<br /><br />The book itself is amazing; I've read it before but the pop-up features make it more tangible and real! Nothing was overdone and it was tasteful, beautiful and just perfect.<br /><br />Recommended for new fans as well as old fans! Get this book guys!
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I did not read \\"Eat, Pray Love\\" but suffered through the movie.  I bit on this book after reading a review in Time mag and downloading the sample.  The beginning about the fathers early life wasn't bad so I bought the book.  What a snoozer.  What caught my interest in the reviews was the mention of the history of evolution.  That part of the book is squeezed in at the end and is barely relevant to the rest of the long boring story of Almas long boring life.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|When I buy a movie, it's a movie that I really like, and I love seeing what goes into making the movie.  I enjoyed the special features, and this is a very well made release.
B00FMZSN8Y|5.0|My girls loved this book. I can't wait until we can see it..  great book. Disney does it again, like they Amway do.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|A busy life kept me from finishing this book immediately. It was a story I just had to complete. So although I had to return to it several times, I'm glad I did. It's a great read and so sad at times. A terrible battle of wills! Snuggle down, have a hanky ready and follow the traumatic journey! Frankenstein! Not like the movies!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that the game helps to stimulate your brain with each level. Love it can't get enough of it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What's not to love? Cute storyline, delicious candies, and a deceptively tricky game. I'm so glad there is finally a kindle version!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|REVIEW<br /><br />  Beyond Bridelveil Fall (Dwellers of Ahwahnee)<br /> By Melody Dempsey<br /><br />I love Fiction/Fantasy and this novel takes you on an incredible journey as a young Oria, who, on her eighteenth birthday, discovers a world beyond anything she could have ever imagined as she dives in a pool at Yosemite National Park, where she discovers a magical mysterious and dangerous world. Oria realizes that there is evil in this world waiting to destroy her and she must fight to save not only herself, but her family, her people. This novel takes you into the world of Native American Legends... the mysterious world of Native American Folklore, or is it folklore? Travel with Oria throughout her adventurous journey as she finds out things about her destiny that she could have never imagined! I give this novel 5 stars!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CKR63F2 Beyond Bridalveil Fall (Dwellers Of Ahwahnee)]]
B00267QOEQ|5.0|Best movie!  Classic!!  Adam Sandler is funny and original in this movie. Kathy Bates nails her role. I ordered this movie remembering that I laughed...wanted my Tweens to see it. There are some bad words and it is Adam Sandler....but a great movie to watch with them. They want to see more Adam Sandler now :)
B00CRS88IO|5.0|[[ASIN:B00CRS88IO The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada]]  REVIEW: Melody Dempsey<br /><br />  THE IAN FLEMING FILES: OPERATION ARMADA<br /><br />I have always had a fascination with the 1940's era and WW11.  The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada, kept me on the edge of my seat, so to speak. The action that took place as Ian Fleming found himself in dangerous, life threatening situations, so much like Bond himself, was exciting and the historical facts, along with the fictional events and action that takes place throughout this fast paced riveting novel, is a real page turner. If you are a fan of James Bond, then this is a MUST read for you!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I thought the book was entertaining. I find the subject matter a little frightening for children, but understand why children also enjoy author.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|A fun game with a good progression of levels and challenges. Great graphics and a lighthearted theme help the game also.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|One of the best game ever! It's good for big and small people.try it may be you will like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that the kindle fire finally can play candy crush.  The screen is easier to play on than my phone and easier to take with me than the laptop.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game keeps bringing you back.  I like it because if you don't play every day your not penalized like other games.  Some levels are harder and keep you coming back.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I downloaded this book to my Family's kindle cloud. My husband, my 10-year-old son, and I all read it together - each on our own kindle.  This book provoked wonderful family discussions and was just a great read in every way.  Very glad we read this before the movie came out!
B0083Z614S|5.0|It is still good today and such a nice moral to it.  I want to get it for my great granddaughter for Christmas.
B003CH9PTU|1.0|[[ASIN:B0012QTT4O Pilot]][[ASIN:B0013SQP66 And the Bag's in the River]]Movie and access were horrible.  First after several tries we could only access the preview several time (with Roku3).Were charged for it but didn't and wont watch.  The second part went on and on about some grunge band.<br /><br />We want our money back!!!!  Not sure of second title, but the grunge band didn't interest us and went on and on.<br /><br />Please make the right.
B00DJZ06DO|3.0|Definitely ripped off the bluray and formatted as DvD, missing pieces, and the description is inaccurate. This film is 2012 (jp) and yet to be released in the US, so if you wish to get ahead and watch this before the legitimate release, go for it, but its not genuine.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was fast moving and a terrific story with a great ending.  How the author though all of this up is amazing and amusing.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Very good, exactly what I expected, great film, I would watch it numerous times. Great entertainment for the whole family
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I stumbled upon this series about 3 months ago on a whim. After having read the \\"Hungary Games\\" series I was worried I was going to walk away disappointed in the portrayal of the young female heroin. I could not have been more overjoyed. The character of Tris highlights the strengths every woman has in life and shows her making decisions based on intuition, strength, and every ones well being, including her own, in mind. This character does not allow anyone to make her mind up for her or to be puppeted around by others. Tris is an excellent role model for young women today. To quote this amazing author Veronica Roth, \\"be brave\\" out there.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love the new characters he has introduced in this book and really look forward to the rest of this series!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|This was a good family movie.  I saw nothing about it that made me suspicious of an ulterior message.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a movie with no vulgar language or uncomfortable bedroom scenes.
B00CL151G4|4.0|Nothing wrong with the DVD set at all packaged well, well made. No defects on playback. Just a bit dull and good at putting me to sleep!
B0081336FO|5.0|I think that this season was just as clever as the last. I didn't know that i loved Sherlock so much until the last episode because I actually cried. I would've enjoyed more episodes in the season but overall I loved this season
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was wondering what the hoopla was about so when this came out on kindle as a free app I downloaded it. I can see why people can't stop playing it. It is very addictive, an absolute time waster, but I am hooked. Hooked just in time for a long Maine winter.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I was slightly disappointed that there weren't a lot of episodes. I still liked the season and I think that Sherlock is brilliant. Sherlock and John are like the perfect fit and overall I loved this season.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a good game for the free time. Maybe, the idea of paying for additional features such as special movements is not that good. Hence, i rated it with four stars
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A really good book, lots of what if's and who's to blame.  It was very entertaining and interesting and I would recommend reading the book.
B003BW0CB6|2.0|Not best work. It seems that the author painted himself into a corner toward the end so he took the easy way out..,kill off the bad guy. The actual ending leaves the reader unsatisfied.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for Candy Crush Saga to come on the Kindle Fire!  Thanks so much now I can play where ever I go!!!<br />If you haven't tried this game you need too!!<br />Try it you'll like it!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|A great way to blow off some time. Persistent, so it keeps going while you aren't logged in. Very much like sim city.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|It was very cool and had lot of action. I enjoyed watching it  with a friend he also enjoyed it.
0316143472|5.0|Full of the infamous Sedaris style. His wit and humor ring true and makes for a great light read while still insightful and honest.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Based solely upon the trailers I saw before the film was released, I was hoping this would be an action-packed, special effects extravaganza and it lived up to expectations.  One could argue that some of the acting is over-the-top but I would counter that the acting almost has to be exaggerated in order to keep pace with the elaborate special effects and intense storyline.
B00BM1J7YG|1.0|Two pair came with my Toshiba 65L7350U.  Both pair broke within a week of usage.  The frame part that goes around your ears are so thin that if you put a pair of headphones on, they will break.  Toshiba will not replace them because they realized that they are defective, they replaced them with a stronger frame FPT-AG01U glasses which are a lot better and cheaper on Amazon, 59.00 and are made by Toshiba.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is really fun and a great time killer is very entertaining and also very addictive but at the same time easy to put down I can't explain pure awesomeness but this is I
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved everything about this book. It was funny and sad at the same time. I cried my eyes out for two days. So worth the read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|OMG! I was immersed with this story from page one. In my mind I could hear and feel the emotions this book so skillfully laid out. John Grisham has outdone himself. The characters magically sprang to life. They were described with such detail, I felt like I had known them for years and years. This book deserves &#34;movie status&#34;.  &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; still has the power to captivate me. &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; now ranks the same. Thank you Mr. Grisham!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I never thought anyone could bring forth the thoughts of a young child so vividly. Mr. Card succeeded, and made me feel the  protagonist's feelings. The isolation and weariness of Ender was something to which I could relate, as well as the horror of war.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games are average.  you will get tied up beating the levels. so it is valid way to pass your time.  I would down load it again.  is this twenty words yet
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This is the type of movie that you forget you're watching a movie!!!! It's a must see a will one day be a classic
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|They reveled too early that the mandarin was not ben kingsley. also final action scenes with stark without suit a little too much over top. other than that marvel comes through as usual.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|A continuation into the life of Henry the VIII. No king or queen in history had a more interesting and appalling way of ruling and dealing with women, the court, his subjects and religion. All four seasons will keep your attention and leave you wanting more! Season 2, however, begins to set the king up as the mentally unstable man we know of today.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Didn't work when I streamed from chrome browser.  Permanently interrupted full screen viewing on my computer.  Unable to contact google for help.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|Stromae is brilliant. His lyrics are poetry on many levels. Urban existential love for the full body experience of a great track. He layers beats intuitively but without relying on genre or simplicity. No one sounds like Stromae. I could go on but won't. Buy the album and watch his lessons. You'll fall love in love with his humor and his sound.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I dont like it or love i admire it im level twenty seven im sugarbear44 natrual motions games is awesome love it
B00881VLCE|4.0|The only thing it needs is more pictures, but it's calming and interesting. Keeps your mind busy and helps to clear your mind.
0316204366|5.0|We have read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books and this one is as good as the others.  Would highly recommend this book, great read!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I wish there were more puzzle games like this. It's very mysterious a challenging but in a good way. Can't wait for more. GET IT NOW WHILE IT'S FREE! Full game!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm sure I'm just like all my fellow readers...I love books that I honestly can't find myself to put down. And this book is exactly that! About halfway through I thought I had already figured out the husband's secret, but boy was I wrong! I stayed up until my eyes couldn't see the pages anymore and finished the very next day. If you want to read a book that's an honest &#34;page-turner,&#34; then this is the book for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this app. It finally came. I've always been looking for, but I never found it.  I am extremely addicted to it. I never doubt getting this game. :) LOVE IT &lt;3 SO HAPPY OMG!!! :D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun my cousin likes to  play it when we were going on vacation we played the whole way there I suggest you get this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game i can't stop playing it, I recommend to everyone its really fun and it makes you think.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game on Facebook.<br />So glad they finally decide to give it to us on here.<br />Now I can play it when I'm out and about.
B0042KZJR8|5.0|I love everything Michael Buble sings, so this album did not disappoint.  I highly recommend for anyone that is looking for an updated, modern day Sinatra sound.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|my dad has had a stroke and he has a hard time remembering some place's and some simple solutions,  any came that makes him think really makes him happy and when he's figured the correct answer it really makes shine
B00846REIS|1.0|I'm going to review this book as is (not compared to Fifty Shades of Grey). It was awful. I didn't even finish it. There were times when I thought the dialogue was between high-schoolers. The sex couldn't have been more gratuitous. For a girl that confessed that she didn't know much about sex, she certainly seemed knowledgable to me. Somehow I missed the part when they fell madly in love and couldn't live without each other. Was that between sex in the car and sex at his parent's house? I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|I thought the acting was very real and the writing was wonderfully thought provoking. Free from the gratuitous violence and sexuality that often seems to be required. What a wonderful movie!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing book. Don't listen to all those people who say it's not good,take my advice and read it!!! Besides I'm a teen and would know what teens like. So READ THIS NOW!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|BUY IT ITS THE BEST GAME. EVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRRR AND I'M TOTTTTTALY ADDICTED!!!!!!!! If you like puzzles this is tots the Dr game for you.
B00FEX2ZFG|4.0|Intensely scary movie.  Great plot with great acting. Original and not same predictable plot. Definitely recommend this film to others.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love the game. It's so cool I love all the old guns and the first place for being the most popular game is on a kindle. My favorite gun is the flame thrower
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Movie, brillant in sharing several stories, throughout several differnt time periods, from times of slavery to futuristic societies. All of the chracters in each story, and time period, are all experiencing finding courage, working with like minded people of all different backgrounds, and nationalites to fight and change injustices that threatened basic human rights like freedom of equality, companionship, freedom from might over right. These stories eventhough taking place in different time periods are all interelated, demonstrating human strength, resourcefulness, love and to be willing to interact and help one another. Watch it more than once and used close caption to help understand unfamiliar tribe language. All of the actors did not disappoint, all were exceptional and believable. Enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I had 12 iron I was not attacked and it just disupered.!!!!!!!  don't get it because it gets boring in two days.  this ducks should be 99 cents!!!
B001BANK32|4.0|A great Stephen King classic.  Decided to read again before I got his new book &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;. Glad I did.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Well THIS GAME AWSOME. It good,I mean It did scary my brother,and me little. When you get used to be scary and fun, But it is to easy. Bug 1, when I had 3/8 pages, I went to the broken house porch and if you stand in the right place, slender comes (you can see him walk up)he CAN'T get you. But if you move, then he can get you.  Weird right. Bug 2 you can fall through the map. Well that all bye
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it is on my kindle!<br />This is my favorite game and now I can play on my break at work.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|The movie wasn't bad, but it just wasn't what i thought it would be. It has funny moments but i thought it would follow last ones, but it doesn't. Glad there's no more being made!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|The app is amazing clear HD and everything but had a glitch and would close as soon as I clicked it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played it online for a little while and liked the game, so i added it to my Kindle. Fun.
B00ESLTNR8|4.0|Always loved this book, read It first when I was about ten years old. I always think It is a perfect rites of passage story. Still relevant today.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Not a bad action film. Obviously packed with special effects and graphics, but not so strong on the plot. It is pretty unsophisticated story. The fight scenes are as usual, highly exaggerated and although rendered well are hard to believe, due to the indestructible aliens and the machines. Overall a fun movie to watch.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|it could be a little more detailed, but is s good guide for a great and growing program--well, well worth reading
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Daughter loves this Supernatural and has loved the other seasons also cant wait for the next season to come out we would recomend them to everyone
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This contains spoilers.<br />  I am not one to analyze books. I actually couldn't care less if the author didn't employ perfect plot or perfect character development or perfect whatever. All you people giving this book 1 star cause you're such an expert on writing and how this book should be written are down right irritating. If you know how it should be done so well why don't you go write a novel good enough to be read by hundreds, maybe thousands, of people yourself? Gah.<br />  Anyway, about the book. At first I was a little skeptical of how this was going to go. I wasn't sure where Veronica was going to be taking us and I was feelin like I was not going to like it. I started warming up to it after the first couple chapters, though, and then couldn't put it down. I drank it all up. I am enchanted with how Veronica Roth seems to be able to put down in ink such beautiful strong emotions. I always thought feelings that intense couldn't be contained in words. It all just hits me really hard in the hearts.....as did Tris's death.<br />  I honestly could not believe it when that happened. I kept saying to myself \\"no, it's not real. She is going to wake up any second now.\\" It wasn't until Tobias saw her body that I was really hit by the truth.  Let me just say right now that I get really attached to book characters. Sometimes I just cry when I finish a book because I become so sad that its over and I don't get to be with those people anymore. So you can only imagine what I did when Tris died.<br />  These books literally changed a part of me. That's what books do. You read those words and they are imprinted in your mind and heart forever. Tris changed me. When she died I felt like I had literally lost a real close friend. I was so angry when I first read those words  I had to stop for 10 minutes and just cry and ask Veronica Roth in my head \\"why? Why would you do such a stupid pointless heart breaking thing?\\" Then I read a little further. It was those last few pages that made it beautiful. It wasn't beautiful that Tris died. It was beautiful because of the people who made her death meaningful. Who held her in their hearts forevermore.Those who accepted the pain of what had happened and had not succumbed, not given in to the grief. Those who took it to better themselves and mended each other. They suffered loss and it didn't make them empty and hollow-eyed. It made them stronger, softer, more compassionate, beautifully flawed and exquisite.<br />  I am sorry I am not very good at writing reviews or anything for that matter. Which is funny considering how much I read. Hopefully this review was not too confusing for you and hopefully it made you realize something more about this book. You can rise after falling. You can be brave
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Beautiful. I loved the story, the writing was easy to follow.i devoured this book in less than a day. Broke my heart.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I liked the stories about old ways of printing vs books. The characters were not the best parts of the book, but their interests helped move the plot along. it was fun to use the Internet to tract down some of the methods and places mentioned by this author.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When your bored... play this game. This game can NOT get any better! Except, can u guys put a Ford F-350 in as a car that you can buy? THANKS IF POSSIBLE!!!
B005PM3YII|5.0|Beautiful end to the trilogy. A twist to the uses of fantasy and faith. Good triumphs over evil as always.
B005LZW8FO|3.0|I could not make any sense of this movie,I mean A young drives home from A party drink,and runs wright into A suv kills some one sometime later she.s releast from jailfor doing her time.But while all that something strange has happened another planet has popped wright in the same orbit as ours and guese what its A twin to are own and the people of that earth are identical to us.Like I said no sense.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I recommend this book all who had read about law of attraction but still is at the same place of life.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I think it is a great mixture of the best parts of their styles of the past. However it also shows so much growth for the entire band. I think the entire album is great, a good one to listen to beginning to end. Davey's voice continues to get better and better. Jade's composing is amazing and Hunter and Adam continue to grow and keep up as well. I think this album balances lighter, poppy songs with the very dark tones and lyrics. Burials is on its way to becoming my favorite AFI CD of all time.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I  chose this rating because the dongle works perfectly but the Netflix service does not always work or may not work with all movies. So just a little wonky but perfect for casting to my bedroom tv.  It was just too far to run a cable or connect it to another computer.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|We really enjoyed all of the seasons of 24 and are sad that we've completed them all.  They couldn't make a ninth season - I think Jack is like a cat and has 9 lives and he used 8 of them up through out the seasons.  He couldn't die for real.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Oddly enough this is a little more for adults than kids, but still rated 5 stars for me. I really don't thing the evil guy being the underdog in the beginning is a good picture for young minds.
B003MUSV9W|5.0|Love the characters, the actors,. Tomei and Downey are adorable. Bonnie Hunt is wonderful, the drive in Italy is breathtaking. A fun romantic comedy flick. Enjoy!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Action take a leap forward, tough to get your breath on this one.  Cumberbatch still can't live up to Ricardo Montalban but does an admirable job of making you see the attachment to his own crew which was never portrayed in the original.
B002TLSSXO|2.0|The concept is great, and these utensils look terrific in the box.  But there are several problems that become obvious when you start cooking with them.<br />--They are relatively heavy, when compared to most familiar brand utensils.  They are even heavier than Kitchen Aid.<br />--They are thick and unwieldy; and that is being said by a person whose fingers are long and narrow.  I can't imagine a petite hand managing these easily or comfortably,  On the other hand, a large man's hand might find them ideal.<br />--The capacity of the ladle is not adequate.<br />--They are a bit too bendable at the useful end.<br />--They rest nicely on the counter during use, but they take up a lot of room in storage.
B000I9W08I|3.0|I loved Barbara, I liked the sets and costumes. Most of the numbers were okay, but this film suffered from the &#34;They're singing again?!?&#34; syndrome. The story was weak.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is Tom Clancy @ his best. Hawkish attitude, fast and continuous action, familiar returning characters and acronyms! Nuff said!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Too Lazy? Too tired? Well this game allows u to go hunting with out moving! It is even more fun! Trust me, I hate just sitting and sitting and sitting there waiting. So if u ask me, i will never delete this app.
006202406X|4.0|Realistic and yet unfair.<br />Feeling numb and betrayed.<br />But in the end my hat goes off to Ms. Roth for being so brave.<br /><br />\\"We believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another.\\" -Dauntless Manifesto
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So thrilled to see this finally available for kindle fire. I started playing this on my phone. Highly addictive and tons of fun!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|When I first had this game I started to laugh because of all the different ways we can create combinations
B009GXHOW4|4.0|I love it love it love it. This app works on the Knidle fire, but for some reason when I put something In my inventory, it is there, but all my chests in the world disappear. Everything is still there, but it is hard to locate the exact chest I need. This app is fantastic overall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that we finally have candy crush saga on the Kindle fire... I can play it on here but not Facebook for some reason.
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|I compare this record to Jack Johnson's latest, \\"FROM HERE TO NOW TO YOU\\"--a beautiful and heartfelt blend of Bob Dylan and the Beatles--and I wish McCartney would shoot for that rather than trying to recreate \\"Live and Let Die.\\"  Sorry, Paul, I just don't care for what you are trying to do here.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I fell in live with Star Trek for the first time when I saw this.  Now I love all of them.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|If you like heart, soul, excellent guitar playing and songwriting, fun love songs and a great voice, this album is for you.  I love every song.  Bob Dylan meets the Beatles.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|this was a wonderful story.  it was well crafted and the characters were well defined.<br />i felt as if i knew them all well by the end of the story.<br />keep it coming liane moriarty.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Excellent show.  Actors brought the characters to life.  Good choice of cast and scenery and costumes.  Hope I will be able to enjoy their work for years to come.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addictive and challenging to figure out what moves to make so that you can clear each level in the time or clear all the blocks needed to advance.
B009NH6AOQ|2.0|I LOVE The Walking Dead with all my heart but the first disc is really starting to piss me off. The picture shows up horrible and the menu barely opens after the opening credits begin. It is only the first disc that has messed up I there is NO reason AT ALL for this. I did not pay money for this type of quality.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book blew my mind. I've never had the pain or struggle of knowing someone close to me with cancer, but this book took me into Hazel's world. The characters were so endearing yet so blindingly human that I feel as if all of them are my friends now. His thoughts were incredibly insightful. I would recommend this book ten times out of ten.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|If you like the modern Marvel movies (Ironman, Thor, Captain America) then you will enjoy this show. WARNING: This TV show contains spoilers from the movie Marvel: Avengers.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I always think I have it figured out and Reacher out thinks me. Such a strong character with character and integrity. Not much integrity left in this country. Thanks, Mr Child.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|First of all ---- story-related comment: it is so intriguing and dense that I couldn't read between the lines... And I think I'm pretty good doing it.<br />My second point relies on the writer herself -- and careful SPOILER ALERT--- my deep and absolute admiration to Veronica Roth for having the nerve to make such an incredibly hard and interesting decision involving the main characters in the divergent series. I mean, seriously??  Not exactly the soft-spot romantic ending. BRAVO!! Veronica...... BRAVO!!
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I love this album, but especially Jonathan's solos, his voice is mind bending and without compare, You've Got the Love is my favorite duet, Endless Love is also Excellent... I never get tired of listening to \\"Perhaps Love\\" or their first album \\"Together\\"\\"... If you love good music, you have to buy this album.... It is simply the BEST!!!!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|owned this DVD befofre, loaned it to a neighbor and it was never returned.  It is such a good action/adventure film, decided to buy it again for my movie library., especially since it was listed at such a great price on Amazon.  Highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. Is a very addictive game. Just wish it was easier to get lives. I play it almost too much.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|If you don't mind a lot of swearing and you are a fan, you will enjoy this concert film tremendously.  She was funny, personal and very sincere.  In today's music world, it's always surprising hearing the artist's voice during a live performance matches exactly like the recording.  Her rendition of her biggest hit &#34;Someone Like You&#34; was the highlight of the night-- especially after hearing the background story of how the song came about.  Highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Just started and seems great so far.  Easy to download and install.  Seems like it will be a fun game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Unbelievable twists!!!! Just when you think it's over, the story takes a surprising turn! I will recommend this to everyone!
B009EDYZBY|4.0|The kids loved it and I found it surprisingly amusing. The kids were laughing throughout the movie and were entertained the entire time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The program was very entertaining and I would recommend it to the rest of my family and friends. The English version is especially  entertaining and attention grabbing.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|A perfect little reminder of how powerful we all are with fun little experiments to convince even the biggest skeptic.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Great! Brand-new and had a trifold layout. Great music and an awesome Dvd came with it! Honestly every time I buy something through Amazon directly it always gets here fast and has great quality! :)
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book! I especially love the wonderful characters who develop and blossom over the length of the story! Kudos!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game, although I liked playing it, always froze on my phone..it was very frustrating so I quit playing. I had looked for it on kindle but wasn't available...by chance found it the other day and I am having a blast playing it...hasn't froze once! Thank you.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|ok it did clean my kindle fire up I got a lot of stuff to be gone some things I never knew I had on there. I like this clean master
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My granddaughters love these apps. They are educational and highly entertaining. As two old's, they will play the Dr. Panda games over and over.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|once you finaly get it to open its ok..<br />but I almost gave up cause it took so long,............<br /><br />................
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|This was a nice bloody horror film. Done with all the budget that the original lacked. But it is also lacking Bruce Campbell.<br />On the other hand, it was pretty true to the idea and wasn't terrible.
B00BHWG1OO|4.0|While residing in NYC his host persuaded Allen to put on a series of shows to be recorded and video taped.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is a fun game.  Not too easy, but not so hard you want to give up.<br />You should definitely get this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga.  I play it on facebook and waited for it on kindle and it is finally here.
B00499QUK2|4.0|(surprisingly) I am not a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch's acting, though I have heard it improved in S2.  Martin Freeman is fantastic, and the writing is fantastic.  Still torn about the length of the show, always seems to drag a bit in the middle
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am not a huge Taylor Swift fan. I thought her last album wasn't that great but this album definitely makes up for that! this is the first full album of hers besides her very first one when she wasn't as popular and uninfluenced by the teeny boppers that i just can't get enough of! i am not in her age demographic either i'm 27 and i wasn't too sure about this album but i got super lucky! if she keeps putting albums out like this i will keep buying them :D
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Has a multiple set of flavors and feelings.  Good trio of musicians, who at one point remind me of older vocals by Ozzy Osbourne, some good rhythm and beats that remind me of Grand Funk Railroad, all the while being easy to listen to.  I will look for more from this group.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I would never read a book by this author ever again. When I first started reading the book I was bored. All the little tiny details and all the never ending ramblings. It just dragged on with little to no excitement. I continued to read the book only because I was curious about what really happened to Amy. But I felt like I had to force myself to keep reading. It did FINALLY get interesting in the second part of the book. But by that point I had already wrote this author off. I was intrigued by the plot and then was really eager to find out how Amy would get caught. And then she didn't and then the book just ended. Like the author ran out of ideas. All I could say when I finally reached the end was &#34;WHAT?! That was the stupidest ending there ever could be!&#34; That sums up in one word what I think of this book - Stupid.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Haven't played for too long, but so far I really like how the game feels. I like the different aspects of it.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I thought I would think this movie was cheesy, especially since I don't care for magic, but it actually had a pretty good plot that kept me engaged and int he end I felt like I was watching a bit of a mystery magic show. Good actors, character dynamics were pretty good, and was something different in concept. It's no academy award winner, but its a nice movie to watch.
B002RI98BA|5.0|This book was a fascinating view into the life and times of one of the worlds greatest statesmen. Beautifully written and crafted this book is a great historical review of the great Lincoln's life.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I most certainly was not expecting this ending but in the end I felt fulfilled and smiled when I finished this book. Would I have wrote it differently? Yes. But it doesn't change that this was a well written, well thought out series. :)
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Great app. I downloaded it for my children and we all sit next to each other to play together. We challenge each other
B005WYFLNU|5.0|She was two when I gave it to her she still likes to play dolls with it and it's just about a year later.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Cool game. It is kind of addicting and once you see your friends ahead of you, it makes you want to continue playing to meet their goal
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show! It's the main reason that I signed signed up for Amazon Prime. I could watch it all day.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you have watched the show and loved it, you still need to read the book. So many things were changed and I glad I decided to read the series.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Finished this book in less than a day. I fell in love with the characters and how even though they has cancer they weren't ashamed to admit it. Hazel the main character is so inspiring and everything I want to be I hope I will meet someone like her someday
B004SDEP38|2.0|My tablet came with DTG which was a full blown program that allowed you to create Office type files. This one just allows you to view them and therefore is largely useless for any serious work. The program would not update, so I deleted it and downloaded the free version, which now is only a viewer. It may be useful if you can download files from your computer or the cloud and view them, but you cannot edit or add to them using this program. Probably not worth the trouble.
0691023565|4.0|This book is a gentle introduction to heuristic reasoning. It will very useful to mathematicians, physists, and engineering students, as well as professors in making. I found this book instructive in learning how to identify a problem to find and a problem to solve (you will see the difference).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were more levels. Fun, challenging-like how the game forces you to adapt to its logic with each level.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I only used it once but it is very cool alarm, works well, easy on the eyes when you wake up in the dark.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|The Circle is the latest of several novels to take a critical look at how social networking and technological immersion influence close relationships and society as a whole.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to enjoy this book, I couldn't find it satisfying on any level. The tone of the novel is very self-satisfied. While reading, it's hard not to imagine Eggers winking at the reader as he takes another easy potshot at surrogates for Facebook and Twitter. There are some interesting discussions about the negative consequences of free information and social networking culture, but they are not found here.<br /><br />The Circle also fails as a human story: Mae Holland is the worst type of female protagonist, she is a human pinball bouncing between powerful, older men who want to sleep with her, record her, and give her lectures (not necessarily in that order).<br /><br />If you're looking for a biting satire, try Super Sad True Love Story (a much funnier and more critical book). If you're looking for pathos and some understanding of the millennial mind, read the Unknowns. Or, if you'd like a light thriller involving Google, I'd recommend Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore.
0385351399|1.0|This idea for this story was fantastic, the actual story however was not. There was no climax and no real resolution. The main character is just a shallow person who is not even a character who has enough personality to dislike. My husband and I listened to the audio book and have discussed whether or not the book would be better. We have not been able to figure out a way that the literary version would of been better. I really wanted to like this story and held on to hope that it wold improve, but alas it never gets better. As my husband said, &#34;It makes you sad,&#34; and not the story but rather the waste of time and money spent on it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Suzanne Collins she has a bizarre imagination,  she is a good writter. The trilogy at some point shows an insane world hard to take it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very nice game. Addictive. Puzzles are challenging which I like. Restores energy pretty quick compared to other games. I have not spent any money on this game and I'm still advancing fast.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is mind blowing awesome stuffed greatness. Great characters, great mystery, great suspense. I really enjoyed this and think everyone that likes sci-fi suspense character mystery awesomeness should read it
B004N868DS|5.0|Superior to any fabric mouse pad I have ever used. Incredibly smooth and consistent surface texture. Worth the extra money for a great gaming mat
193700788X|5.0|(**Spoilers ahead**) I know fans are not happy - but leave behind the ideals. Would Sookie really have spent her life being Eric's mistress? She knew she never wanted to become a vampire. And sure, Bill loved her (I'm Team Bill), but it would have never been enough. She stated from the very first book she loved the sun too much. If she'd willingly become a vamp, it would have gone against everything she'd ever said and wanted, and if she'd been turned against her will... I'm not sure she'd have lasted long before walking out to the sun on her own.<br />Sam was always there for her, and for everyone who has complaints, well... I think it's an apt ending. I don't see how ending it differently would have been good enough for the Sookie we've seen go through boyfriends and friends and enemies and frienemies for 13 books. I will miss them and am looking forward for After Dead, just to get a bit more of closure. But the helpless friendzoned romantic in me loved Dead Ever After.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I was afraid I might learn something about Lincoln that I wouldn't like but his idiosyncrasies made him even better
B008Y5OWMK|4.0|I've been looking for this for a very long time. Finally found it on Amazon and purchased it right away. The only thing that I could say on the negative side was that it came unsealed, didn't realize it was used?<br /><br />Otherwise, it came quickly and intact.
B002SJIO54|5.0|I am writing to say that this is a interesting movie.  This is science fiction film that I wanted to add to my collection of movies such as this.  I am very pleased.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|I am a big fan too, but like the previous reviewer, I was a  bit disappointed, but not that much. This is a great album for sure.  ...However that aside for now, I did find it interesting that if somone expresses a fair opinion, 0 out 3 people find it \\"unhelpful\\" within a few hours... It is not \\"unhelpful\\" simply because a reviewer didn't think it was not 5-stars.<br /><br />Unlike the previous reviewer, I wasn't disappointed by the mellow songs....I actually like Lemmy and group a lot when they do that...like the old one \\"one track mind.\\" It shows depth to me. However, this album sounds vibrant, yet paradoxically, a bit tired too at places ....I thought the very first song (Heartbreaker) has a verse or two, too many, and gets repetitive.... the lead guitar comes in much too late, just seconds before I want to hit Fast Forward....it started off well though. Same for the other songs. Queen of the Damned is great...so is Knife...The album is very good, but the sound wasn't as tight (well-rehearsed?)as I would have expected. Something is missing, I can't put my finger on it. One song \\"Going to Mexico\\" sounds like a variation of Ace of Spades...that's why I say that it sounds a bit tired at places too. But hey, it is a great effort....after so many years they have come up with something way better than I was expecting.<br /><br />Update: Yes there are a few songs that sound like a mix of Ace of Spades, Bomber, Overkill, or something...and yes, the first song sounds painfully repetitive to me, but I absolutely loved the screaming tight lead and arrangement on Lost Woman Blues and Crying Shame, and also the bass and lead back and forth on Queen of the Damned...for that I am upping this to 5 stars...great album!!!
B002ZG977Y|3.0|I am really not impressed to by this version of the movie, but I did like that it's was an update of a movie that I saw when I was a child.  I know the trend in movies now to use CGI as a way of making FX's but I enjoy the stop action more so.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very challenging game. It makes you think and ponder what will I need next. We need more challehging levels ASAP.
B00004Y87O|3.0|Escape from New York is a fairly entertaining science fiction/survival movie.  However, compared to other John Carpenter films that I have seen it is a bit underwhelming.  The character, save one, are all incredible forgettable.  The cast is good, but most of them are not given much to do at all.  The film does have great production value, and some good fights though.  All-in-all I did enjoy the film, but I did not love it.<br /><br />The plot is very simple.  In the year 1997, because of crime rating rising 400 percent, all of Manhattan is now a giant maximum security prison for the worst scum.  The prison has no guards on the inside, but is heavily guarded all around the island by the military.  The president’s plane crashes in Manhattan and the president (Donald Pleasance) has been taken hostage.  In response the head of the prison forcefully recruits a one-eyed mercenary/prisoner named Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) to infiltrate Manhattan and rescue the president.<br /><br />The cast is great.  You have many big names like Kurt Russell, Donald Pleasance, Tom Atkins, Ernest, Borgnine, etc.  Unfortunately, most of the cast is wasted in the film.  Donald Pleasance is barely in it, and when he is he is not given much to do or say.  When he does utter some dialogue, I could barely tell what he was saying.  This was not Pleasance’s best performance.  Tom Atkins is given such a nothing role that I wonder why he even took the part.  You have Ernest Borgnine who plays a cab driver who is a fan of Snake and who is a coward.  He shows and then after ten minutes just disappears from the film.  Then at the end he re-appears helps snake out briefly and then dies very soon after.  Basically, his character was pretty much pointless.  Kurt Russell is the only one given a lot to do and he is the only likable character in the whole movie.<br /><br />Snake Plissken himself is okay but it seemed like he was trying a bit too hard to be badass.  His voice seemed force, almost likehe smokes like nine packs of cigarettes a day.  He sounds very much like Batman in Christopher Nolan’s Batman films.  Maybe this was their inspiration for Batman’s voice in those films.  The other characters are very forgettable and unlikable.  The cab driver is barely in the film and then dies very unceremoniously.  I barely got to know him at all before he died so I am not that invested.  There are other characters that are somewhat allies with Snake like Brain and Maggie.  However, those two barely have a character, turn on snake at every chance they get, and also get killed unceremoniously.  There is no reason to care about those characters.  The villain known as the Duke is a bit lame as well.  He has no character, and does not come off as that big of a threat to Snake really.<br /><br />There are many good points to the film as well though.  I like the premise quite a bit.  The idea of New York becoming a giant prison with no guards so the prisoners can run riot is a great idea.  I like the society the criminals establish inside the prison.  The film looks great as well.  The film, like most John Carpenter films has a great atmosphere as well as an awesome score to it.  I did like the bits of action that we got.  Snake is a badass, even though I think he is trying too hard to be badass.  The film was entertaining overall.  So, in end, I think that this is worth checking out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this to he available on my kindle and now it is!<br />Game is addictive and Does not disappoint.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love, love this game.  My family, and I, have been waiting sooo, long for this app on Kindle Fire.  the only bad thing I could say about this game is the frustration of being Stuck on one level for so long. Thank you for this game keep the levels coming. :).
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! It's not as good as the computer version but it's the best game you could ever have. This game should  be $20.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|...more than I like listening to them.  \\"15 Steps\\" starts off the album strong for me, but the rest of the music is difficult for me to connect to.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|SO GOOD. if you like puzzles that are intricate but not frustrating I RECOMMEND! This was great I played it all in half day. Yet I was s satisfied, a bit spooked and left CRAVING MORE,!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Provides capability to manage local files on the Kindle Fire HD much like either Windows Explorer on the PC or 'Finder' on the Mac. One can create folders, move & delete files, etc. This program is very useful in general file management of a Kindle Fire HD (and other Android platforms). Recommend this application if you need to manage your files locally on your tablet or smart phone.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|After having seen it on you tube and it was withdrawn, I searched and found it with you....etc.......what an inept survey I had already seen it and then purchased from you
B00EP22QKG|4.0|JJ & the BH are rocking hard as ever, yet the album is amazingly fresh. One is hard pressed to think of another example of what made Rock great being produced currently. Joan has lost none of her edge. If you long for real Rock, but not as nostalgia, this is it!
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Good book, typical J. Green yet a happier ending. Teenage book meant more for adults to read, probably a little boring for a teenager.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|Harold \\"Egon\\" Ramis teams up with Murray yet again, but this time just as Director (and Neurologist), Murray is a self absorbed weatherman stuck in the same day Til he gets it right... Brilliantly conceived, Funny and superbly edited, especially given the nature of the story...Great, somewhat underrated movie ... I may have seen this movie more times than I've seen Rocky or Raiders, but, again given the nonlinear nature of the film, I really have no idea. Bill is quite dramatically touching at points, surprisingly, just as surprising is the chemistry between he and the lovely Andie M, There's also Just enough Chris Ellliot to make him funny, also small (recurring) cameos by Bill's older bro Brian Doyle, and the great Stephen Tobolowsky as Needlenose NED the Head Ryerson!
B00F9A903O|5.0|Really fun and addicting it was just like when I had my iPod there was a game like this and I could not stop playing it get this game it is AWESOMENESS
1607066017|5.0|This book was put on my wishlist after seeing it on a recommended graphic novel reading list - there wasn't much of a plot summary of the story other than it was about a young family.<br /><br />Before I purchased the graphic novel I when through the sample pages on Amazon and I enjoyed the art work so I thought I would pick it up.<br /><br />Guilty of judging a book by it's cover - I figured that this was a story about an angel and a demon that have a love child during an epic battle, but to my surprise and delight - this story takes place in Outer Space.<br /><br />The world is well developed and it's background is very interesting.  The characters, although I'm not clear on their motivations through out, are very likable.<br /><br />This product exceeded my expectations, as soon as I finished it I was trying to get my friends to read it.  It's a very under rated series.<br /><br />The product condition was very good and I'm confident that I can pass this book around to a few people before signs of wear and tear are evident.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This is a good movie.  I really enjoyed watching this movie and will be watching it for years to come.
0785165975|5.0|I was kinda surprised at some of the lower ratings of this title because people were saying that the art quality was not there, that most of it had been &#34;phoned in&#34;.<br /><br />Personally I think the art style looks fine and this book does the job of being filler for between Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2.  I like the store that follows Hit Girl around better and I feel like this book really took a close look of where her character is coming from and where it wants to be.<br /><br />A lot of other reviewers seemed to hate that it wasn't as good as the first Kick Ass book, but I don't think this is like the Matrix series where the first movie was the bomb and then every movie after that was worse and worse.  I don't think &#34;Hit Girl&#34; or &#34;Kick Ass 2&#34; have sunk that low.<br /><br />I enjoyed it.  Hardcore seems to be in great condition, so I won't be afraid of lending it out to friends.
