B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Rented the film through Amazon steaming video to watch with my kids.  They had read the books, but I hadn't.  I absolutely loved the movie as did my kids.  Often when we see a film based on a  book they have read, they are disappointed.  Not this time.  I'm inspired to read the books before the next two movies come out.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great game, fun and a good time killer. Was a free app of the day. I'm glad I down loaded it!
0345803485|1.0|Main character is the poster girl for insecurity.  She has no depth, ambition, self-confidence and only finds self worth in chasing after a man that treats her worse than a pet dog.  If you have even an inkling of feminism in your body you will hate this book.  example... during her college graduation she can only think about \\"him\\" being there and looking at her...ugh!  Unless your fantasy is to be an unimportant slave to pervy guy because he is attractive and loaded with money this is not a good book.  It made me sad to know this was a best seller.
0545405777|5.0|This is a series that the whole family has read and enjoyed. I'm sure theses are books that we'll keep and read again.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|love MadMen and wish there were new season to come. Alas no more MadMen. Great show while it lasted. I love streaming from Amazon.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this is a really cool app. I would advise anyone with a lil extra space to definitely give it a try.  the Colorado are really cool as well. I give this app a solid 4 out of 5 stars
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I actually have not opened my blu-ray/dvd but saw the second season on amazon instant video that i received as a gift after purchasing the blu-ray/dvd.Love this mini-series!!!I can't wait for more.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Love this movie.  It doesn't even have to be Christmas time for me to enjoy watching it. It so outrageously silly you can't help but laugh.
B007STXHTM|5.0|The dive housing really does remove the vignetting that occurs underwater with the regular housing. I dive with mine on a head strap and completely forget about it. For best results, don't forget the GoPro Anti-Fog inserts.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very Good book ready to read the other books.  Couldn't put it down hope the others are just as wonderful.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Literary crap. I was convinced to read this by all of my friends. I thought it was horrible. I'm an Anne Rice fan myself, and this book did nothing for me.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I really like the X-men series, so it was fun to see how it all started.  How each character got where they are and how it leads them to the current series.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|takes to long to get more help. its also stupid that u have to pay when its a free app if u want stuff.
B000SEI230|5.0|Love all his books!!!<br />Although it was nothing like the movie it is still by far one of my favorites!
034580404X|5.0|Fifty shades trilogy was a good set of books.  I wasn't ready for the series to end. Wish there was more!  Thanks E L James.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Okay, not my normal sort of movie, but my wife insisted on watching it. It is typical British humor, dry at times. The movie does sometimes try a little too hard to be sentimental. the leading characters have great chemistry though, making up for some of the gaps. Seems that they may have cut a little deep along the edit lines, so things just sort of happen. Be interesting to see if there is an unedited version.<br /><br />I give it a 3.5, but 4 is close enough. B if you need a letter grade.
1596912863|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was fun, fast and highly entertaining.  Is it great literature, no, but then a lot of great literature is very boring.  This is a \\"fun romp\\" to use the language of Austen with lot of twists and turns in the mystery plot.  Very fast moving plot.<br /><br />Main character needs a chance to get away from her life in the US, just for a short time and so decides to go to an Austen period live action sort of resort.  While there, she encounters a mystery with twists and turns along the way and has an opportunity to see her life with a new set of eyes.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you enjoy a fast paced fun mystery with humor a long the way.
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick is one of the best books I have read in all of my 21 years of life. This book is the perfect source of adventure for all ages. Readers receive a little bit of everything; especially the unfortunate events that Hugo Cabret has to undergo throughout his childhood. However, with the people he encounters, the mysteries he discovers and the secrets he uncovers, his life changes for the better.
0385738765|5.0|After reading The Maze Runner, I HAD to read the sequel and am so glad that I did. I loved the second book of the trilogy. From the very beginning, there is action and suspense. I felt like I was reading and watching a thriller as the events in this book played out in my head. I loved how there was never really a 'safe' zone in this book, unlike the first when they were protected by the walls of the maze. Not knowing who to trust and seeing Tom become a true leader made the book very fun to read. I would have to disagree with other reviews who say this is a 'filler' book until the third was released. This book was much more than that. With the amount of action from this book, it throws you into the third with full force. A complete page-turner and a lot of fun to read.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Amazing collectors edition bundle! The zombie head is pretty well done, it is very nice that you can unlock the whole thing by pushing the screwdriver deeper into the eye socket. Great look, great item, great presentation for the greatest series ever made!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app soooooooo much. its a wonderful amazing lovely app. I have gotten sooooo much out of this great app :)
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is one of the funest games on the kindle fire. you cant go wrong with this game so you should buy the game now. it is q lot like crush the castle
0385737955|4.0|I started to read this trilogy right after I finished reading The Hunger Games and really enjoyed this book. Having the whole mystery of Tom's background and history, while being thrown in with a group of boys who don't know their background/history made this book quite a page-turner. I loved all of the characters in this book. I also loved how you as a reader and an observer are unraveling the mystery of the maze with the characters, so you're as surprised as they are when something happens. Dashner was able to help you unravel this mystery without giving too much away and leaves you wanting more moving on to the sequel.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app is horrible it wont let me see a video is don t work do not get this bad app
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the first book (paper back). Could not wait to read this next one, so got it through my Kindle. I was not disapointed. Really enjoyed this one. Highly recommend it.
1476712042|5.0|Loved this story.  It really moved along and I had a hard time putting it down.  When I wasn't reading it I was thinking of how quickly I could get back to it.  Yes, I do agree that Travis has issues and is definitely stalker-ish but he was never anything but good to Abby.  Abby seemed to understand him like few others could and was attracted to him just as much though she fought it on several occassions.  More than once Abby tries to make sense of their relationship (or more accurately their break-ups) and comes to the conclusion that it doesn't make sense unless they're together.<br /><br />Several reviewers have made comments that this is a dysfunctional and dangerous relationship and sets a bad example for young readers.  I do agree to a point, but I find it particularly irritating that people can rave about Fifty Shades of Grey, calling it a mature romance rather than the dysfunctional relationship it is.  What works for Christian and Anastasia doesn't necessarily work for another couple.  We all know couples who seem to be \\"walking disasters\\" yet somehow it works because there's a connection or attraction that can't be denied. GREAT roller-coaster-ride of a love story, let's not overthink it.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of language in this book though not gratuitous and same for several sex scenes. I believe this is a YA designated book, though I would only recommend for older, mature teens. This book packs some big emotional punches as two messed up people find some \\"normalcy\\" in each other. Look for Walking Disaster, due out next year, which tells the story from Travis' POV.  If you enjoyed this I would HIGHLY recommend [[ASIN:0373210493 Pushing the Limits (Harlequin Teen)]] and [[ASIN:0802798225 Perfect Chemistry]] and [[ASIN:1416571736 Going Too Far]].
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BOUGHT ALL THREE BOOKS IN THE HUNGER GAMES SERIES FOR MY IPAD USING THE KINDLE APP. IT WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN IBOOKS OR THE NOOK APP BOTH WHICH I USE REGULARLY. I ENJOYED READING THE SERIES, AND I AM 54 NOT A TWEEN. I HAD SEEN THE MOVIE AND OF COURSE THE BOOKS ARE BETTER, JUST AN ENTERTAINING AND INTERESTING WAY TO SPEND SOME TIME. WOULD RECOMMEND ALL THREE AS WELL AS DOWNLOADING THE KINDLE APP FOR IPAD.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I always love the siege type games so I kept on this as an FAOTD.  Wish it was a little more difficult.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Weel Thiis App iis Amaziinq Broo:) ii Love it You Can Chanqe Settings As You like if You dont Like it as it is:) Two thumbs Up:D
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie, in my opinion, is a rarity among the coming of age movies. Usually they have a lot of gratuitous sex and little in the way of character depth. This movie however has the characters falling in love and really just being there in bed and not having sex is a big milestone for this genre. The acting is really great and believable coming from two straight guys
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book is a very poor example about what to expect in relationships for young women reading this trash. It was also very poorly written, too many repetitive phrases.  It did not make me want to buy the 3rd novel. I was not interested in what happened to the characters, due to lack of character development.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|What a great follow up to The Game of Thrones!  The Clash of the Kings does not disappoint.  I only have one complaint about it and that is that I could not put it down long enough to do things that I needed to.  If you haven't started the series, you will definitely want to.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Caitlin Moran alternates between vignettes from her life, told in an ironic, faux-naive first person editorial voice, and her views on feminism and women, which are illustrated by these vignettes but conveyed in a more witty, compassionate, serious tone. This book had me laughing out loud in the coffee shop, then considering for days after the implications of what I had read. I recommend it highly.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is worth it because it is free.jetpack joyride has a lot of missions.this game is awesome.u should get it now
B0086QS7N2|5.0|One of the best Rush offerings in many years.  Headlong Flight is awesome as well as the singles that were released early.  Lately their CDs took awhile to 'grow' on me but this one was solid immediately.
B00080DIWE|5.0|It's plastic, versatile, comes with numerous clips, and is actually two turntables rolled into one.<br />The base is narrow enough, as is the primary surface, to allow in to be used in downdraft paint<br />booths where you don't want to block the surface of the booth that contains the vent fans etc.,
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love to listen as well as read along to this Bible app.  I read the KJV, but it's nice that there are many versions of the Bible in this app. I've had no problems whatsoever using it on my Kindle Fire.  I've recommended it to both friends &amp; family.
0385344333|1.0|Until the Kindle price is lowered, I will not buy. Or, I will have to haunt the second hand stores for a more affordable paperback copy.<br /><br />Yes. This is the site to not only rate the contents of the book but the price as well!!
1452110581|5.0|This was very entertaining, since I lost my cat years ago, it brought back some cute memories. The author is really good at her subject matter. I would buy more of her books
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the Reacher books and couldn't wait to read \\"A Wanted Man\\".  Finished it in one day over the weekend.  Lee Child doesn't disappoint.  Can't picture Tom Cruise as Reacher in the movie, since he isn't tall enough and he's too pretty.  I think Liam Neeson would have been a better choice.
B008KEQMDC|2.0|this movie even though it had a good cast was not a winner in my book..it took a while to get going..and even then was still all over the place..the cutest parts were when u seen babies..my husband and i wont watch it again..and we certainly wont buy it..
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game takes up time when you need to kill some time. reminds me of Sim city good game. wish the buildings were a bit easier to find with the prices.
B0045NDVFE|4.0|I purchased the Band Perry  as I love most of their music. Post card from Paris, If I die young, and ... the one about the only girl I'll ever love. But was also glad to find several new songs that I hadn't heard before which were also top quality.
B009329ZF2|3.0|This movie wasn't bad. I enjoyed the action and the acting while not Oscar worthy also wasn't bad. It did a good job of \\"playing\\" battleship in the fight scenes. Overall I'd say this movie is worth watching, but unles you fall in love with it, don't buy it.
B004G6009U|2.0|The description said TWO disc Blu-ray/DVD combo.  There was only ONE Blu-ray disc in the case.  Not even the slip cover was included!  COMPLETE SHAM!  I DID NOT GET WHAT WAS DESCRIBED!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome. its. is so fun.  I don't see why there are all these bad reviews.<br /><br />beat whole game in a day
B009AJD5E0|5.0|There are plenty of lengthy reviews here so I'll try to keep it simple.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of various opinions of the content in the movie, but if you liked or disliked anything you saw it's a film you'll want to talk about for hours after seeing it.
0345803485|5.0|I have heard so many people talk about this book. It was so much more than what I thought it would be, and you're just left with the feeling of wanting to be read the next book.  Anna and Christians relationship with all the ups and downsthat they face. but still a passion and there love burns between the 2 of them.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is probably the best Kindle Fire case of all time. It's not bulky like many protective cases and not flimsy like the sleeve made for most tablets. I would definitely recomend this product for anyone looking for a case for their Kindle Fire.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I loved this workout and saw alot of progress after just the 11 days I was able to do. I am so sad that I had to stop because of an achilles tendon injury! I have been walking 5+ miles a day for months and then decided to try this dvd. Jillian does alot of jumping jacks in the cardio interval, which is what I'm sure lead to my injury. I'm only 22 and have never had a problem like this, so I'm shocked. Jillian is amazing and I did lose an inch off of my waist after just 11 days, but my advice is to make sure your body can handle the stress of high intensity circuit traning before starting, because this pain is no fun!
B000SOZXJG|5.0|Whale Rider was a wonderfully directed movie with a powerful message.<br /><br /> The movie centered on a teenage girl, Paikea, whose mother and twin brother died during the childbirth/delivery. Paikea's father obviously devastated at the loss of his wife and son- was interrupted by the arrival of his father and mother, the father obviously not caring about the sensitivity of the situation instead he insisted upon seeing the boy.  The grandfather, Koro, after learning of the boy's death shunned his granddaughter and insisted on chanting over the poor little angel who had passed away.  Koro had believed that his grandson would be the heir/chief for their tribe who would bring about change as we found out later in the story, once the boy died the grandfather was distraught over who would lead his people. Paikea in the mean time grew up living with her grandparents because her father had taken off not long after the death of his wife and became an artist.  He traveled extensively throughout Europe and only visited occasionally- mainly because of the strained relationship you saw between the father and son.<br /> Koro eventually grew to care for Paikea but insisted on embracing the old ways that the next chief should be a man as with many traditions he was rock solid in his beliefs. Koro eventually set up a school to teach the first born young men the traditions and customs to hopefully choose a new chief among the families of the tribe.  Paikea who only wanted the approval and love of her grandfather sought out to learn these traditions unfortunately Koro was disgusted by this and sought to dissuade Paikea every chance he got.  Paikea eventually learned each part and excelled at every turn with the help of her uncle, Rawiri.<br /> Towards the later part of the movie, we learn that whales which were a spiritual symbol of the Maori tribe as it is believed that their ancestors rode on the backs of whales when they entered our world so whales were a revered symbol for thetribe.  A few beached whales were discovered by Koro who insisted that someone were to blame for this and wouldn't let Paikea help in the efforts to get the biggest one back out to sea.  Paikea ended up riding the whale for some time and was later found unconscious, she recovered and the entire tribe celebrated the announcement of their new chief, Paikea even her grandfather looked proud as they rowed into the ocean together as a tribe.<br /> Whale Rider demonstrates how in many older religious beliefs that were male dominated, fought and resisted women being allowed to serve in seats of power.  Through this story it is demonstrated how a teenage girl who strives to be this chief/leader of her tribe, mainly to prove her significance to her grandfather.  Also shown is how as generations evolve and change certain ideals among indigenous religion view such as in this story when Koro establishes that the heir must be male- as it was told in ancient oral histories and through traditions.  The progression of the views and beliefs are a common side effect to mainstream modern times to influence some indigenous views that can be interrupted in a fluid manner.
B005LAIHAO|2.0|This movie started out with great potential and slowly wound it's way down to a feeling of \\"why am I still watching\\". The main character is a man down on his luck forced into a family vacation that turns into a run for his life and a desperate attempt to save his family. The twists and big reviles were cliche and predicable. Half the time I kept wondering \\"why is he doing that\\" or no way he'd walk away from this. Unfortunately I had a hard time getting behind anyone in this film, good guy or bad guy. I think one of the chase scenes sums this movie up best as our hero takes 5 minutes of the movie to chase someone down only to run away when he caught up to them. I have only ever walked out of a movie once. This would have been my 2nd but 1 of the 3 of us  was actually enjoying the move so we stayed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like to share ideas with friends and its a fun way to &quot;gossip&quot; about different things such as recipes and everyday things moms need help with.
B00168HARG|5.0|This show was actually really good. A lot of action, good acting and an interesting re-imagining of the original storyline. It's a shame that it was cut short before it really had a chance to get interesting.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD every song is sensational! This is not your typical genre music I would consider it a soutern rock/country
B000OPOAJS|5.0|This isn't the most original movie ever made, but in terms of action and especially car chases, this is one of the best hands down. The epic car chase scene in this movie is one of the best ever made and makes this movie deserving enough of you owning it on blu ray. Yup, it's that good.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|I am experiencing same problem as many others... audio only - no video when connected to the TV. I'm running iPad 1 wi-fi only with iOS 5.1.1 and tried Netflix, YouTube and Videos (using movies I rented from iTunes) and on multiple televisions throughout my house (old 4:3 CRT TVs and a 16:9 flat screen HDTV) and all the same result -- no video.<br /><br />I spent lots of time Googling and it appears that there are many others having this same problem. One board poster suggested o to settings/videos//tv signal and select output either NTSC or PAL (try both to see which works). Unfortunately I don't have this option in settings/videos :( but msybe that will help someone else here.<br /><br />I couldn't find any official word from Apple either (BTW I was shipped a real Apple product as opposed to some of the other reviewers here that received some knock-off product) so sadly I'm returning this product today. I may have to go to Apple store with my iPad to get the straight story. If I find any news, I'll post an update here.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|The first season was uh-ma-zing. It is definitely rated R though, if you know what i mean. Sometimes the R rated scenes get a little pointless and explicit but they do not take up a majority of screen time so its easy to ignore or skip if your not into that kind of thing. The beginning of the first episode started really slow but once you get to the end you CANT stop watching. Probably after every episode I was like  \\"WHAT? no, I have to watch the next one now!\\" until I got to ten and was sorely disappointed that season 1 was finished, I cant wait for Season 2!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have it on my droid raze too but I use it on my kindle too. Its the only alarm clock that really works
0439813786|4.0|When I first encountered Brian Selznick's book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, admittedly it was daunting. I love to read; however, huge Harry-Potter-sized books are not my cup of tea. But this book was a pleasant surprise and defied all my expectations. With every turn of a page, Selznick sparks the imagination by elaborately sketching out Hugo Cabret's complicated life. Through the unconventional pages and movie-still illustrations, this book makes for a quick and great read. It truly felt like a movie in a book. The focal point of the story is the experience, not just the plot. Unique and charming, this book is great for all ages.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|War and Peace its not, but it is a very entertaining series of novels. Great read if you just want a break from reality.
B00138H876|5.0|Blood on the Tracks is Dylan's greatest personal masterpiece...A peek inside a very private genius. If i was stranded on a desert island with only 5 or 10 albums forever,,,this would be my FIRST pick
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so boss its epicness bock story is stupid compared to this. you should listen to me. get this game.
0547564651|5.0|This book should be required reading For helicopter parents. You know, the annoying parents hovering overhead their kids worried about how jr (who can't walk yet) will do on the SATs. The things that make us happy and successful are more than math scores. Paul Tough identifies persistence, self-control, curiosity, conscientiousness, grit, and self-confidence. What most of would consider a large part of Character.<br /><br />How do we help our kids find these non-cognitive skills? Read the book!  It is however an exploration and explanation, not a cookbook. There are no pictures or diagrams, and sometimes the format of revealing little details about people/places/reviews gets a little repetitive. Feels a little like lots of magazine articles put together with not enough of a master story arc. But each piece is very well written. The author is clearly knowledgeable, and knowledgable not just from reading books and research papers, but from sitting in classes and watching the magic happen. He left the New York Times to go research this book. I'm glad he did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very good facts Good foods and things go do. I love to get on here and and look at the stuff and make some stuff
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great cast, great storyline, seductive and suspensefull. I couldnt stop watching it and now I'm just waiting for season II to come out.

B008RTE066|5.0|This CULT film deserve five stars and more, the songs are excellent, the sequences are beautiful surrealist, I hope Apple will soon publish HELP; LET IT BE and THE ANTHOLOGY in bluray!!!
B0072OFM28|2.0|The first season and the prequel were great. Vengeance was weak.  The character of Spartacus was poorly cast, and it didn't help having the storyline they wrote for him.  The guy's all of a sudden changed to a politician, giving speeches every episode to a disorganized horde to stop them from destroying each other, followed by, \\"Yeeeaaaahhhh!!!\\"  Lots of times the story gets goofy and unbelievable.  The new Naevia isn't good either.<br /><br />The thing that made Spartacus work before was Batiatus.  Without him, and combined with the loss of Andy Whitfield, it's just over.  I understand that if the story were to continue any further, the story of the ludus and the arena needed to end.  But the current cast of characters, without a great lead actor or two, and the lack of good writing to make up for it has ruined the show.  And with the people who were killed off at the end of Vengeance, it makes the next and final season seem like there's absolutely no hope for an ending worth watching.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Had seen Emma on the the tv.  Had wanted to own the dvd. Enjoy the period costumes,and learning more about the time that Jane Austin writes.  The chacters are fun and interesting to watch. Amazon is my first choice when looking for dvds.
B002RV01QI|5.0|This music relaxes you when you are stressed out in traffic.  Enya is in the genre of spa or calming music.  The whole cd is amazing.  You will love this music and want to order more Enya cd's.

0143036742|4.0|Story of elderly father and 2 daughters and a blonde bimbo that marries him for citizenship and money. It was humourous in spots. It was heart wrenching and touching in others.Good read,good family story of love and strength and endurance.\\" Good characrter development!
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Use it daily to keep up with the market.  the only draw back that the kindle version is slower to respond.
0060723513|5.0|I have read this book dozens of times and I never fail to pick up something new. It always makes me feel inspired, and I have shared it with many friends who all loved it as well. Definitely worth reading and cherishing.
B008XG1X18|4.0|good app needs a little work tho. app keeps shutting down and it would be good if you can edit your boards
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are interested in military operations or just want an accurate historical perspective of a nearly impossible raid, this is a good read and a (apparent) real life review of how this assault was achieved without significant American casualty or worse. A good insight to other SEAL / counter terrorist activities as well as a perspective on just what it takes to be a member of one of the most elite, well trained and efficient fighting units in the world. A story well written, well told and complete with adequate details to make it interesting all the way through and informative too.<br /><br />Mark Owens (alias) does a great job and avoids self-hype and false or inflated bravado. He comes across as a real person, hardworking and dedicated to his duties and job. My hat is off to the fighting men and women of our armed forces and especially to those dedicated and driven to be a part of the most advanced military fighters on the planet. Thank you NAVY SEALS for getting rid of this real world terrorist and exacting a bit of justice in his own residence.<br /><br />Personally, I am glad to see that the truth was unveiled and not white-washed, diluted or re-written to be \\"apologetically correct\\" by the clueless office worker types in Washington DC. This mission was far too important and far too historical to be told to the American Public in a Fairy Tale \\"good guy\\" fashion - by the media or by the government.<br /><br />Read the book and get a first hand account.
1475143389|5.0|Bigger Leaner Stronger is a great book for those who want to gain lean muscle mass while learning how the body works. Before reading this book, I had little knowledge of the human anatomy especially with weight training anatomy. This book describes how muscle is built, fat is lost, and what kind of diet and supplements a person should be on. This is an unbiased view of weight training, fat loss, and supplementing that is worth every penny. Thanks Mike.
0345803507|3.0|I found the first book to be intriguing. The second kept my interest til about half way through. I found it very repetitive txting, sex, on and on. I felt the third book became very predictable and I was bored with reading before I finished. I am glad I read them all and for the most part enjoyed them. I had been told two and three were better than the first, I just did not find that to be the case.

My friend and I saw the theatrical release & couldn't pick out any scene that was added or noticeably extended or more 'raunchy' in the so-called 'unrated' cut of the film. What am I missing?? Or rather what is the so-called 'unrated' cut missing? AM I blind??<br /><br />Anyway, the film isn't bad. If you liked the first 3 films, I'm sure you'll like this film. It's largely more-of-the-same. The characters have all moved well beyond HS, got jobs, got married, got bored and want to relive a little high school mayhem. Which they do. As always, many scenes \\"played for awkward,\\" lots of sexual and potty humor. Some of it pretty damned funny, if you're into that sort of thing.
0425263908|3.0|Satisfied my curiosity to read Bared to You but not original.  Right down to the part where Eva fell meeting Gideon...way to similar.  It lacks excitement and orginality.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I am by no means an expert merely a reader. But hands down this is the best book I have read for a very long time. Rebecca Hamilton pulls you in from the very first line. The story is interesting and the characters thought provoking. I long ago stopped reading books like this one as they all developed the 'Twilight syndrome' but I am so glad I did as I enjoyed every page tuning second of it as Rebecca takes you on a journey through century's of lore and legend. A must read for anyone who is interested in anything supernatural,mythical,Wiccan etc. My fangs are snapped down eagerly awaiting the time that I can get my teeth into the next installments.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A good read, keeps you thinking. It helps you understand life better. We all go though this in our lives.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Yes, much like angry birds but different enough I had fun with it. Got it for free so well worth my money
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Overall the movie itself was engaging though if you have read the book then you will see the missing elements that should have been included. Movies can never carry everything I understand, but some character setting was left out that really should have been in there.<br /><br />As for the dvd itself, it's decent, though there are no deleted scenes included which is kind of ridiculous. That would be my only complaint, otherwise, it's a good dvd.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Written well and an easy read.. but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be with all the hype surrounding it.
0525953728|5.0|It is hard to put this book down once you start reading it.  You can tell it is honest, based on experience and coming from the gut of the brave warrior who authored it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book!!  It was full of action and kept me very involved with the characters.  I fully enjoyed reading it and the two that followed.
B0090EIILU|1.0|lousy, predictable and extrenely crude-to call it humor would be a compliment to this piece of trash.  I feel dumber after watching even the first half, after which I turned it off.  It would be more entertaining to take three one dollar bills and light them on fire.
B0087HT36U|3.0|This is an good game. The controls are simple: tap on an area and that's where your boulder, fire jar or any other thing lands. The object is to knock down and destroy all the bad guys in the level and try not to harm the good guys. But here's where the problem comes in: the physics of this game is terrible. Here you are, you have just hit a pillar with your rocks, smashing everything into oblivion in the process but you've still got a bad guy floating in the air. How unrealistic is that? It really messes up the game. If the physics are unrealistic then you are not really using your head figuring out what you should hit to take down the bad guys, you are just guessing and that takes out a lot of the fun. All that being said, if you just want a game where you don't have to think get this but if you want a game with good physics go get Angry Birds.
0425263908|4.0|I really enjoy this book it was a good read fineshed it in two days. It was up there with fifty shades a little different but I felt it was a good story.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|The movie is a great look on Batman. I would suggest this to anyone that wants to see a darker version that the old cartoon series or movies. It shows a great deal of detail on what happened in Bruce Wayne's life and introduces the first villain rather nicely.
0525953728|5.0|If you like reading first hand accounts of our military in action...this is a must buy!  I thoroughly enjoyed the matter of fact, interesting, and humorous account from this American hero.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I read this book out of curiosity, like most of you probably are. This was an easy read and not too long. It is amazing to be able to hear her side of the story, but at times it gets frustrating and I had to put it down once or twice. You're going to need to be able to stomach some disturbing behavior to get through this one. Overall, it was just ok.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I thought this app was going to be silly when my sister asked me download it.  We have so much fun playing this together.  With the Fire you need more of a pen to draw more exact pictures, but what fun is that. I wish there was more color selections to start off with.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This was great \\"bang for the buck.\\" At times the stunts were so unreal they were silly, but this was an entertaining way to spend two hours. Blu-Ray made the audio as great as the video - maybe even better, as it was truly as if the sounds were being created in my living room. I don't want to be, but I'm a fan of Tom Cruise's movies.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The Hunger Games was NOT a movie I was interested in seeing, having somehow made the wrong assumption regarding what kind of movie I thought it was.  I thought it was one of the current, endless dark, violent, plot-weak/less \\"shallow\\" movies that rates way up there for teens.  Despite the number of people who rated it, and the near 5.0 star rating from so many, I was not going to watch it.<br /><br />I changed my mind when my husband told me he believed \\"Katniss Everdeen\\" was, in real life, a professional archer (as is Geena Davis.)  And am I ever glad I did watch it!  I bought the movie, in fact, after seeing it for the first time 2 weeks ago or less, and since that first time, I have already watched it over 10 times.<br /><br />It's hard to put a finger on \\"specifically\\" what made it such a pleasant surprise, but there's no doubt...physically, physiologically, mentally, emotionally...I was GRIPPED to the point I wouldn't even pause it for a 15 second bathroom break.<br /><br />Using a list, here are the following elements that made me rate this a 5-star movie:<br />1.  An original storyline and plot<br />2.  Quality of the acting performances, by both leads, and supporting actress/tor<br />3.  Jennifer's exceptional loveliness: she is beautiful inside and out.  (read bio)<br />4.  Excellent Directing; steadily growing from the start, never losing focus<br />5.  Dynamite special effects without sensationalism.  Used sparingly, but INTENSE!<br />6.  The moral...very well defined without forcing the point:  purity of goodness overcomes the adversity of the corrupted in power, who cause suffering.<br />7.  Last, and yet the most influential - the power of being stunned by the unexpected, and original \\"points/actions\\", etc...that spring up here and there in the movie, causing the RARE (for me) \\"rabidly gripped attention.\\"  The closest example I can offer is the \\"husband-who-is-unapproachable-because-he's-on-the-edge-of-his-seat, body-leaning-far-forward, eyes-riveted-to-the-puck/football, head moving-without-control-as-eyes-follow-what-they're-glued-to\\" kind of gripping attention, see?<br /><br />But that's MY opinion.  *grins*o-the-puck/football, head moving-without-control-as-eyes-follow-what-they're-glued-to\\" kind of gripping attention, see?<br /><br />But that's MY opinion.  *grins*
B005LAJ1H2|3.0|While I've now had the pleasure of seeing both seasons 1 and 2 of BOARDWALK EMPIRE I found the second season to be far more satisfying than the first by the end of viewing. However my review is not about the quality of the show but rather the quality of the package itself. The inner folder that holds the discs is very hard to remove from its slipcover, I noticed the finish is actually being rubbed from its corners it packs so tight. But, to make matters worse, disc 4 of the set is defective, there is freezing and skipping that occurs in the beginning of episode 11. I'm surprised at this, since I've purchased many an HBO series on DVD over the past few years and this is the first time it's happened. I should also mention that just as with BE season 1 all the discs are single layer. Is this HBO's way of trying to wean us off DVD and move us over to the slightly more expensive Blu-ray? Please, if anyone else has experienced this I'd like to know, so feel free to respond. In sum: five stars for the season, three stars for the package itself.

0345803507|5.0|I can't get enough of this trilogy! I really started slowing down about midway through this book (knowing there was a whole other book to go) because I didn't want it to be over. I don't believe for one moment that these books demean women or are objectifying. People who say that have probably not read the books. Phenomenal books! A beautiful love story about healing, battling your personal demons, and the magic that comes when two people commit to each other and vow to sort through each others baggage. Read these books!!!!
B00445RHKI|5.0|My cousin from Maui stayed with me in Honolulu for a few days...she watch my \\"Modern Family\\" before going to bed...ended up staying awake till all episodes were watched. Laughed her Butt Off.
0345803485|5.0|I can't say enough about this trilogy! A must read! Not porn, not degrading to women, etc. These books made me want to cuddle up to my hubby every night (and NOT because I was fantasizing that he was Christian Grey)! I couldn't imagine how E.L. James would wrap these books up but she did such a beautiful job! I hated for them to end but it was truly one of the best endings to any book I've read in years!
B004UNX1LS|1.0|it shuts down every time I play a vid!! no offense world but I know they can do better!!please upgrade this appx100000!
0345803493|5.0|Ladies - do not fear! I had heard that this series was all dirty S&M. Is there sex? Yes. Is it kinky? Sure. Is it filthy porn? NOT AT ALL! If you've seen a rated R movie with a sex scene and haven't run screaming from the theatre, then you will be just fine. Not only that, you will absolutely love E.L. James and the amazing characters she has created. The human story of Christian's metamorphosis would be enough to make this a best seller! On a personal note, these books opened up a whole new dialogue between my husband and I around our sex life and spiced up an already hot marriage!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I didn't have a whole bunch of money to purchase a ritzy case for my Kindle, but I knew I needed one and perhaps something that would also serve as a stand.  I've had this product for over 9 months now and I can definitely say not only is it inexpensive, but it serves the purpose of protecting and offers a stand that works quite well!<br /><br />I watch movies and TV shows on Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime ALL THE TIME and this little guy goes anywhere with me! If you're looking for basic protection and functionality, I highly recommend this case.<br /><br />It also comes in 3 other colors and is very lightweight, with an elastic strap to hold it shut.
0812982622|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a remarkable book. I've been a fan of Adam Johnson's work since his story collection [[ASIN:0142001953 Emporium: Stories]] (which I credit as being a primary impetus to my own fiction writing), and though both books are stellar, they are so in such different ways. It's hard to believe that the man who wrote Emporium is the same guy who wrote The Orphan Master's Son. Perhaps the two personalities are a Jun Do/Commander Ga thing (reference to the book).<br /><br />Check out my video review of this book by searching for my channel, calebjross, on YouTube.

B0071XO8RA|2.0|I really have know idea lately what everyone's fascination with very dark and gloomy tales are. It seems the more depressing and heavy someone can make a story like the\\" hunger games\\" the more people like it. I have no problem with people dying as part of the plot like in RR Martin books, or in more high tech books like the \\"lost fleet\\" series but my god these people that said they couldn't put down and stop reading this story I am at a loss. This is like a soap opera in book form this person wants to die over a lost love another person dies without being able to reconcile past love another person dies because they know to much sheeeesh. To top it off this all happens in a underground bunker were people grind out their miserable lives in dank dark close quarters. Give me a good sword fight or plasma canon blasts or some kind of action, that to me is what makes a story exciting and keeps the reader on the edge of the seat not depression on top of gloom on top of hopelessness! I would pass on this one if you like adventure and excitement because you wont find it in this story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this!  I have. not had the glitches mentioned by others.  this is fun and easy to navigate. I'm sure ill be using it often.
6304263465|2.0|Teen Wolf, 1985 film<br /><br />The story starts with a teenager playing basketball. His team is losing badly. \\"Chub\\" hides his snacks. Scotty talks to the coach, Bobby Finstock, about \\"changes\\". Scotty doesn't want to be \\"average\\". He developed acute hearing of an ultra-sonic dog whistle. Scotty delivers goods to the drama class. Can Scotty buy a keg of beer without an ID? [In a movie.] A friend rides on the roof of a van while there is a song for entertainment. Scotty goes to a crowded party. A couple shows off on the floor. A bowl of Jello is dumped onto a girl. Scotty and his girl are pushed into a closet. Scotty returns home and looks in a mirror to see changes. His Dad has an explanation! What will he do? The next morning things are back to normal. \\"Werewolves are people like everyone else.\\"<br /><br />Scott gives correct answers in class. But he has to run to the Boy's Room. Later he surprises his friend Styles in the garage. \\"What can I say?\\" A keen sense of smell is useful here. There is another basketball game. [Does the other team look older?] There is a fight for the ball. Scotty wins! He shows his skills. [The fur hides his skilled double.] Scotty is the big hero now! [Believable?] Mr. T. is still the Vice-Principal. People ask for Scotty's autograph. Scotty acts in a play and does very well in bowling. Pamela throws a gutter ball. There is a conflict with Pamela's boyfriend Mick. Scotty's friend Styles now owns a big van. [An acrobat doubles for Scotty.] Scott's Dad tells about his past. Scott doesn't want to be average. Scott attends the dance. [Is there another skilled double dancing?] Buff and Scott dance. Mick attacks Scott [to add drama and conflict]. Mr. T. threatens Scott until his Dad intervenes.<br /><br />Scott wants to be himself in the play. \\"Bummer.\\" he can't do \\"the wolf\\" anymore. This disappoints his basketball coach. Chubby sinks the ball. Scotty's team does much better now. [Is the fix in?] In the last minute the score is nearly even.A foul will allow Scotty two free throws and a winning score. Scotty knows his true love at last. A happy ending?<br /><br />This is an about average story that could have been improved with a better writer and script. Does this echo the \\"Ugly Duckling\\" fairy tale? Is this the hidden fantasy of most average people? This story lacks \\"bite\\" to make it above average. Showing teenage life alone does not make a good movie. Having a hereditary disease isn't really funny. Stories of werewolves followed any outbreak of rabies in olden times. A bite transfers the disease and resulted in a popular legend. Stories about vampires are usually more popular. Some say economic hard times create an interest in horror movies, in the 1930 and in today's \\"Great Recession\\".

B005LAII08|1.0|This movie did have good animation.  That is all it had.  There was poor plotting, characterization and not much action.<br />How to train your dragon was much better.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|This movie was horrible. It was just a bunch of random scenes put together without a clear cut or interesting storyline. Luckily, Snow White is a common story so I still understood what was happening.  In addition to the non-existant story line, Kristen Stewart made it even worse.  She really only had one big monologue and it was meant to be a very serious moment. However, she butchered it and it ended up being hilariously funny because it was so bad.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy this movie!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was not really interested in these books when I read their description, but given all the fuss about them and the amazing selling numbers, I decided to give it a try. Bad mistake. There is no real story, except for a silly girl (who is supposed to be an \\"intellectual\\", but is really a twit) gives in to the charms (?) of a \\"big bad wolf\\". Ok, love stories and clich&eacute;s frequently come together, and provided they are well written I can get past predictability. However here you can find no real story, no real reason to like any of the characters. The dialogues are virtually non-existent (except for the annoying dialogue between the \\"heroin\\" and herself). I am also not against hot scenes in a book, but honestly, if a book is to be just about sex and not about anything else, just call it porn and not try to call it something else. I do not recommend this book tho anyone.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|Love this movie. Every time I see it, I see something I missed the last time.  Don't know how many times I've seen it, but I could watch it again and again.  LMAO

B006H5120E|4.0|Just finished watching the Blu-Ray (2D) disk after receiving it today.  The picture quality was excellent, as was the sound.  My sole complaint about the sound is that the dialog sound level was too low compared to the non-dialog sound effects.  I had to turn down the volume during sound-effects, such as hitting the iceberg, breaking apart, etc., and turn it back up for spoken dialog.  I don't remember having this problem watching the DVD or in the theatre.<br /><br />I cannot comment on the 3D version included in the same package, as I don't have 3D equipment.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Great book, found it a little slow to start, but The Hunger Games was sooo good I continued reading, then found it hard to put the book down. Cant wait to start the next book!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was a very good book. I didn't care for the ending other than that it was a great series!
B003097B64|5.0|An earlier detailed review highlighting the fact the music on these 5 discs was not in remastered sound really put me off going anywhere near this box set, but after buying and being very impressed with the Tom Waits, Tim Buckley & Duke Ellington box sets in the same series I just had to get a copy of the Little Feat and hear it for myself.    There is no doubt it would have been great to hear all these discs fully remastered but I do not think any of these 'originals' sound anywhere near as disappointing as the very detailed earlier dated review suggests.    Like the other box sets I've heard in this series the sound on these CDs is not a problem at all and probably as close to the original vinyl sound as anyone could reasonably wish for. In fact I think the first CD/LP \\"Little Feat\\" in this set actually sounds better than the original vinyl - probably because it has been (unlike the other 4CDs) remixed by Bob Kovach.    I also have Little Feat's more expensive 4CD (remastered) compilation 'Hotcakes & Outtakes' box and enjoy hearing and comparing the selection of tracks on it that are also on this 'Original Album Series', but listening to both box sets (with their different masterings) I'd say the bottom line is you can't have too many versions of the Warner Brothers recordings made by Lowell George's Little Feat and that this 'Original Album Series' Box cannot be beaten on value for money (or musical content).    * There are no bonus tracks on any of the CDs in this box.

B00356CO1E|5.0|I have never spent the time to write a review before but I really want to with this one. I am a mother of 2 and I work at home full time, if any of you work from home you know that's a hectic schedule in itself. I work a lot and work a lot of crazy hours plus taking care of 2 kids at the same time I just don't have a whole lot of time to do anything for myself. I have been trying to find a workout routine that was functionable with my life (quick) and would give me good results. This workout fit the bill I have lost more pounds/inches in the week I have been doing this than I did going to the gym for an hour 4 days a week for 2 months. I started this routine last Monday and I am down 8 pounds so far and have lost 2.5 inches around my midsection. Needless to say that is the best motivator I've had in a long time! I'm not going to lie it is a little tough (for someone who just chases kids around and sits at a computer) but it is well worth it. I'm to the point now where I know the routine so I turn off the sound to the video and play high energy music instead - it has given me my second wind and helps keep the video to not be so boring! I love that Jillian helps you realize if you're doing the workout incorrectly and helps with your posture I've noticed a difference in my body and my energy level. Hope anybody who's reading this gives it an opportunity!

0385344333|5.0|First of all let me say that I was SHOCKED at the negative reviews some of the Amazon readers have given this novel...I thought it was Lee Child at his best!!<br /><br />A couple of reviews have pretty well picked the book apart.  I really don't want to divulge much of the story 'cause I think it will be a fun read for Reacher fans.  I have enjoyed all of the Reacher series and think this is one of the best.<br /><br />Why? Well, the plot is extremely creative and often complicated.  Since I read the book on Kindle I cannot refer to pages...only percentages.  At 20% you think you have the plot figured out...you don't!!  At about 50 or 60 percent you think you have the plot pretty well locked-down...you don't!!  At 90% you KNOW there can not be any more surprises...you're wrong!!  Only in the last couple of pages do have Child's imaginative plot all told!!  A VERY FUN BOOK TO READ!!<br /><br />How should you buy it?  I have finally figured out that Amazon's Kindle pricing is a first class rip-off.  I have the original Kindle...no new upgrades for me.  A couple of years ago, you could buy best selling authors for nine or ten bucks.  I paid over $14 for this book on Kindle.  I COULD have purchased at the same price a hard cover copy from Cost Co, Sam's Club, or (even) Wall-Mart.  In the future I will buy a copy I can give, lend, or sell to cut my price....or wait for my turn at the public library.<br /><br />How much does Amazon think we will pay for the \\"instant gratification\\" and E-reader convenience????
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This was a good summer read.  The concept behind the book is interesting and Riggs' writing style is very accessible. I read this book in about six to seven hours, spread out over several days.  I love the idea behind the book--to craft a story around/about a collection of photographs.  The photos are intriguing; Riggs' story about them,at times, matches this intrigue, but more often, the story lacks the \\"curiosity\\" factor of the photos. It doesn't help that the plot seems recycled from the first X-men movie.  Still, I enjoyed this book more than the movie and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a simple, entertaining read.

And the ending was so horrible I couldnt believe my eyes. it was bangin how dean killed eve tho. So after watching season 6 I dont even have to watch season 7 to know I am going to be very disappointed and I hear talk about a season 10? oh no they simply cannot turn this show into power rangers 100/yugioh zexal/pokemon season 1000 <all shows that should have been ended. Its time to let jensen and jared find new careers.

They had the nerve to have cass say he was God? omgosh I swear when I seen that I said yeah this show is done. But I will still see where the story goes bucause im curious but theyre talking about a season ten? yeah I couldnt even watch season 7 on tv thats how unappealing the show is for me now. I mean come on cass God? these writers gonna get struck by lightning. But this show is still pretty good. Just they need to end it soon or it will be just like pokemon or power rangers.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The Night Circus is, simply put, a collection of images, visuals & sensory pleasures brought to life by words in the most fantastical of worlds.  Told in a confusing jumble of back and forth time hops, Morgenstern tells the story of a most tragic competition. Marco & Celia are raised sternly, without love and for one reason alone - to win a competition.  To that end Marco and Celia train relentlessly for years practicing magic, illusions, spells, and all sorts of esoteric & mystical arts. Little is know about the competition. When will it take place? Who will be the competitors? How does one win?<br /><br />One thing is certain  - the venue. A magical circus that arrives like the night and leaves with the dawn. The circus travels around the world without advertising or fanfare. Meticulously decorated in white, black & silver, the color scheme permeates every aspect of the tents and their acts. And what acts! Ice gardens, wishing trees aflame in candles, cloud rooms, gravity defying acrobats and mystifying illusionists.<br /><br />It isn't long after Marco and Celia join the circus that the participants and venue are identified.  Celia and Marco have been set up to compete against each other in the most bizarre of competitions with the most tragic of outcomes. They must compete against each other, creating grander spectacles and illusions while keeping the circus running because the circus has become an extension of their own spirits and must feed off of them to survive. The winner is the one who can handle the strain the longest and there can only be one. Given these circumstances will Celia and Marco ever  have a chance to live outside the competition and embrace their love?<br /><br />Morgenstern's novel is slow and plodding. The words carefully chosen but not displaying any particular flair. Rather, it is the imagery that rules the book. Wondrous  imaginative creations described in meticulous details. Morgenstern's imagination is like that of a painter and the novel is never more alive than when an outfit or magical piece is described.<br /><br />Action is slow in this novel and the romance a retrained passion expressed by shared glances and brought to life in the amazing acts each develops in an effort to give life to emotions that can't be uttered.  But The Night Circus is without a doubt a tragic love story wrapped in greed, vanity and mania. Many may disagree but this is certainly not an HEA in the traditional sense. Instead it is a cerebral tale of man's quest for control and dominance of this world around him. An obsession - if you will - with being right at whatever cost.<br /><br />The book left me with some incredible images but over all made me feel terribly sad and despondent.vel is never more alive than when an outfit or magical piece is described.<br /><br />Action is slow in this novel and the romance a retrained passion expressed by shared glances and brought to life in the amazing acts each develops in an effort to give life to emotions that can't be uttered.

B000OVLBF8|4.0|My bargain-rack movie for last night was \\"Ghost Rider \\" (Widescreen Edition) starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Well, to begin, I was totally unaware of the Ghost Rider thing and the comics upon which it was based so I had zero preconceived notions. Well, I have very mixed feelings about this as a movie. I didn't care much for the movie, but I found it interesting in a variety of ways. The whole story and the premise behind it is preposterous and requires a strange mixture of beliefs in the supernatural, various religions, the devil and a whole bunch of hocus-pocus drivel in order to enjoy and \\"understand\\" the plot. I'm lacking in that background and just regarded it as unmitigated nonsense. Furthermore, the acting was substandard, to say the least, and the characters were stiff and unsympathetic..<br /><br />However, the production of this movie and the stunts and special effects were spectacular. Time and time again I was left wondering: How did they do that? It's really amazing and I found the movie to be very interesting, not for the story, but for the production. Some of the stuff that is shown here is of Academy Award Nomination caliber, but it's saddled with a non-sensical story line. So, what does one do and how should such a production be rated?. Well, strangely enough, I wouldn't mind watching it a second time and that's compliment in itself. Use you're own judgement. If you're tolerant of complete nonsense as far as the story is concerned and want to watch an enjoyable display of special effects, then it's not a bad movie at all.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I have to admit- I got sucked in the “fifty“ world just like everyone else....I read all three books within two weeks. But then I went back and read them again slowly and you cannot imagine the number of typos I found. Not only that, I was completely irritated by Ana and all her begging she does through out the book, especially in bed. Also, the writing style is very similar to Stephanie Myers (Twilight series), especially the end of this last book. Except, Myers writing is WAY better. These books are basically a great porno read!!
B003MC5N28|5.0|The Giver is a relatively short book, at least now that I'm adult.  When I was in middle school, the two hundred-odd pages probably would have given me a little more reason to gulp.  It wasn't assigned reading at the school I went to (probably because it wasn't published until the year I graduated high school), and despite its classification as science fiction, despite the fact (or maybe because of it) that it was a Newbery Medal winner, the picture of an old man and trees on the front cover were sufficient to keep me from ever picking it up in the past.<br /><br />It's really not science fiction.  It takes place in the future, but so did 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and A Clockwork Orange relative to when they were written.  We need a subgenre for dystopian fiction, not because I demand you get your peanut butter out of my chocolate, but because there's quite a lot of it and it really deserves attention as its own thing (as you can tell from the titles dropped in the previous sentence.  The Giver is a story set in a world in which a citizen government has completely ordered every aspect of daily life.  Children don't have birthdays; they all graduate to a new age together, abandoning the elements of their childhood their age group has outgrown and taking on new responsibilities as a class.  Adults are coupled together by a selection committee, and 1-year old children raised in a nurturing hospital are given to them to raise.  Instincts toward joy and love are tamped down, and negative feelings carefully protected against.  Even concepts as simple as colors and uphill have been weeded out.  The story follows a child whose assigned career path is to experience everything the society has left behind - pleasure and pain - in order to advise the society when dealing with things their atrophied emotional life leaves them unprepared for.<br /><br />What's Good: I thought the story was surprisingly sophisticated.  It's been pointed out to me (and perhaps rightly so) that to a middle-schooler the story would perhaps be more blatantly black-and-white, that the moral choices would be clear to the reader and this dystopian society would, in fact, be obviously dystopian. But the author was clearly an adult, and I believe this is the kind of book one would expect to stick in a young reader's head and mature with them. I think that unlike the above-mentioned dystopias, it's not actually clear that the world is dystopic. People are happy. Yes, there is no \\"love\\".  There isn't joy, and there isn't art. Some ugly little truths (like death) are swept under the rug.  But the tradeoff against depression, against heartache, poverty and famine, a life of fear, a life of continual disillusionment is deliberate, and (at least at some point) consciously made, and successfully made.  The way the society is presented, there really is no underbelly seedier than whatever they abandoned in the past.  There are no clear answers, and that's unusual for a dystopian novel, and especially unusual for young adult.<br /><br />What's Bad: Off-hand, not much.  There are some questions about how some things in the book would actually work (like memory transfer through touch), but they're conceits, not just poor world-building.  The characters are rich and varied, despite the constraints their society puts on them, and the book isn't long enough for this \\"dystopia of boring\\" to drag.  I can't say I actually enjoyed the book, but it -is- dystopian, after all.<br /><br />The Takeaway: I recommend it!  Even if I didn't really like it, it's good!  It's not spoon-feeding the reader a self-soothing opinion; it actually promotes thought. (Plus, it's short, and usually cheap because it's on school reading lists, so you don't have too much of an excuse.)

B008XG1X18|4.0|Easy to navigate and user friendly, however it does have a few bugs - frequently freezes and force closes on launch and following a link from a pin to my browser sometimes results in an error/not found message. Overall pretty good.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|As an avid Dark Shadows fan, I was saddened to see them make a mockery of Barnabas.  Jonathan Frid made the tragic story of Barnabas come alive and won a place in Dark Shadow fan's hearts.  This movie, in my opinion, made a mockery of the original story by trying to make it into a modern day comedy.  I did not like it.<br /><br />** REVISION -  The first time I watched the movie, all I kept thinking about was the original series.  NO ONE can replace Jonathan Frid as Barnabas, plus the story line was off.<br /><br />But, putting all that aside, I watched it again and saw it in a different light.  Although I am still a tad bit disappointed (Barnabus would NEVER have \\"rolled around the room\\" with Angelique!), I do think it was a fresh look at the story line.  Still can't say I LOVE it .... but I haven't watched it a third or fourth time yet.  ;-)
B000FC10IO|5.0|The third book in the Abhorsen trilogy did not disappoint. Lirael and Sam took center stage in this book, as I knew from the second book they would. While the second book suffered from a bit of long windedness owing to needing to explain and set up everything that happened in this last book, Abhorsen suffered from none of that.<br /><br />The pace was quick, but I never felt like any of the story was left out. We learned much more about the nine gates of Death and how the Abhorsen navigates them. There is subterfuge, action, a bit of misdirection, and a final, epic battle. There is a dramatic ending. We learn some of the secrets that have long been teased about in all three books and they are exposed bit by bit to keep you guessing until the end.<br /><br />I particularly loved the Epilogue although I wish it had lasted just a few pages longer. A fantastic series and one that I think is definitely worthy of a re-read sometime in the future.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I pre-ordered and sat back and waited until it came in the mail.  Quick and Easy!! Love the movie!!  Am axiously awaiting the sequel.
B008BO61BE|3.0|The US Festival footage is great, and makes this worth buying.<br /><br />However, the CD sounds like it was run through a compressor. The album lacks the \\"punch\\" of the original. If you like drums and bass you can feel in your chest (and what Judas Priest fan doesn't?), get the original CD.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|this is so bad...the old one works waaay better but it stiled working since they made this price of crap ..DO NOT GET!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|After many years of reading Adult Contemporary and Historical romances, I've now stumbled upon New Adult and YA romances, and I've found some great books recently.  I think I would have liked Beautiful Disaster better if I hadn't already read Tamara Webber's \\"Easy\\", Abbi Glines \\"While It Lasts\\", or M. Leighton's \\"The Wild Ones\\" to name a couple.  Those books were outstanding books about troubled-soul guys who find the perfect girl to balance them out with love.  The two leads in Beautiful Disaster didn't leave me with the warm fuzzies.  Most of the time I wanted to smack them both over the head and tell them to get their acts together.  I did a bit of eye rolling with this book and at the end, I almost felt I could see a divorce down the road for these two. The misunderstandings between the both of them were enough to almost wish they WOULD break up and call it quits officially.  Theirs was an obsessive love that I'm not sure ever turned healthy.<br /><br />But, with that said, it's still a much better book than some of the other New Adult books that are out there now and it did keep me engrossed from the beginning to the end. However, if you want a tattooed, semi-tortured soul, player-turned-only-one-girl-for-him storyline, I would recommend the books I mentioned previously before I would recommend this book.

B00932ANQM|1.0|I tried to watch this movie on two separate occasions. Although I have a Comcast 10 MB link the movie constantly paused. Two minutes of movie and three minutes waiting for the streaming to continue. On Saturday night after 30 minutes I gave up. I tried to resume the movie again early on Sunday, I assumed that either Amazon's servers were oversubscribed, or alternatively the Comcast network was saturated. On Sunday exactly the same thing happened and so I gave up and never watched more than 30 minutes of the movie.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely great.  The quality is fantastic and the music is amazing.  I enjoyed the movie so much, I had to purchase the CD.  It did not disappoint me.  I felt like I was watching the movie all over again.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|One thing must be kept in mind: making a screen adaptation from a best-selling novel is hell. For those who thought this movie was too dark, Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name has such a bleak outlook on life that it sometimes makes you wish you hadn't read it. As I have said in a review of the book, it almost makes you wish you were never born. It was no easy task for Eastwood & Co. to make this palatable to the movie-goer. And it is to their credit that this film is so engrossing, so absorbing without being overbearing.<br /><br />\\"Mystic River\\", as has been pointed out, is Eastwood's tour-de-force. The pacing is swift and, it seems, he allowed his actors a lot of room to explore. And why not? With a cast like this, let them run with their roles. (Laura Linney's Lady Macbeth-like performance was something to behold!)<br /><br />As far as the extras/special features went, they were a plus. While I was disappointed with the Charlie Rose interviews, I was much taken by the commentaries of Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins (Bacon more for his observations on the visual aspects of the film; Robbins more for his comments about acting.) The \\"From Page to Screen\\" feature speaks a little to what I mentioned in the first paragraph about adaptations, and making the words come to visual life that will satisfy the audience. This set is worth having in your collection.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I love murder mysteries but this book was frustrating.  Although the central character appeared to gain more strength and determination as his wife manipulated the truth, he lost his nerve at the end.  Police can't be that stupid.  Hated the ending.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|The story is OK, a bit drawn out and over dramatic at certain points. The story is overly descriptive, treating the reader as if they are 12 but the book is written for adults, supposedly.  My worst problem with this Kindle version is wading through and reinterpreting the numerous spelling and grammatical errors.<br />I will try the next book in the series but if the story angle doesn't change away from lots of fighting, I probably won't continue on with the series since it is a bit predictable.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|As I always state on the rare occasions when I actually write a review, a product has to be amazing or terrible for me to bother writing it. This album warranted a review because it is simply amazing.<br /><br />I had never heard of Emeli Sande but I was intrigued by, of all things, the title of the album. It sounded like something that might be a little deeper than all of the superficial music that has been produced in the last decade. I gave it a preview and was impressed. The one thing that I can say about this album overall, is that it is very uplifting and made me feel better about everything: life, love, and the world. It's not a gospel or Christian album but it still had the ability to draw me in and make me feel something, which most music cannot do these days. You can feel the passion that went into the making of this album. There are no mindless lyrics here (unlike the 4th Maroon 5 album). You can feel how she poured herself into this album. It's as if a renowned poet and talented vocalist got together with an amazing producer and decided to make an album. I was able to listen to this album several times in a row and find something new each time. I am not easily impressed by music anymore but this one took me completely by surprise. It's hard to put into words the kind of feeling that this album evokes but I cannot get enough of it. It's the kind of album that I want everyone in the world to hear.<br /><br />In short, preview it, I guarantee that if you have refined or mature taste in music, or even remotely like projects that show some real effort, you will thoroughly enjoy this album. There is not a single weak track.<br /><br />1: Heaven - Great upbeat tempo, lyrics, and hook. A real head-nodder.<br /><br />2: My Kind of Love - Moving sound and lyrics. One of those songs that reaches down and touches something within you. Has a somewhat epic sound to it.<br /><br />3: Where I Sleep - Another great song, hard to describe, just have to hear it.<br /><br />4: Wonder - Great moving anthem. Makes you want to get up and celebrate life. Has kind of an African dance feel, definitely ethnic and infectious, and very uplifting.<br /><br />5: Mountains - Another touching song, about the power of a united couple facing life's challenges.<br /><br />6: Clown - Deeply introspective. Don't really know how to explain it but I love it.<br /><br />7: Daddy - Great upbeat tempo, so much so that it is easy to overlook the message of the song, which is kind of deep.<br /><br />8: Maybe - Great song about how relationships hit rough patches but not to give up. Anyone who has ever had a failed or rocky relationship will appreciate this.<br /><br />9: Suitcase - A woman confused about why her man is leaving, very nice. Mellow.<br /><br />10: Breaking the Law - Love the acoustic guitar. Would love to see this on an Unplugged show. Very simple but moving.<br /><br />11: Next to Me - Great uptempo number that moved me with a great piano melody (the way \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" did on Adele's \\"21\\"). Very infectious. This may be my favorite track overall. This is the one that you will want to put on repeat and blast wherever.<br /><br />12: River - Another deep ballad. Love it. The words and music will move you.<br /><br />13: Lifetime - Cool mid-tempo song. Very nice<br /><br />14: Hope - One of those new inspiring anthems. This song will give you hope.<br /><br />15: Easier in Bed - Interesting track, hard to describe but nice outro. Made me nod my head.<br /><br />Overall, I can't get enough of this album. I'm afraid that I will listen to it too much and have to restrict myself to no more than one play per day.<br /><br />PLEASE LISTEN TO IT! This is the kind of artist that I would like to hear more of, so we all need to support her.>4: Wonder - Great moving anthem. Makes you want to get up and celebrate life.

B007JWKLMO|4.0|The most eerie part of this comprehensive document was how little the death of John Lennon was dealt with in it.  The segment that dealt with the most tragic aspect of the Beatles mythos was treated , well, dismissively, with Olivia quoting George as saying something to the effect of \\"that was a bad way for John to have to leave his body\\"...what the hell does that even mean?  This brings to mind the exclusion of John Lennon from George's autobiography (I, Me, Mine) and the fact that Lennon, in his last days makes note of it.  I'm sure George was a good man, but he seems to come off as being somewhat aloof and removed from events and people going on around him, perhaps his \\"spirituality\\" caused this...or maybe that's just \\"George being George\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow. I thought I would not like it given what I had heard. Once through the first book, I realized I was waiting for the typical romance line or plot turn. It never came. Beginning of third book finds me relaxing into the lives of the two main characters.<br />Very well written!

In the begining You see Clu Guliger and Gary Busey. Ving Rhines comes in later. then here comes the HOFF. He is Funny. The best part of whatching any movie is whatching them In 3-D. It makes a Movie more fun to See. I give this Movie Thumbs Up.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|First -- the packaging:<br /><br />The packaging for the disc is a bit weak, but this isn't an expensive item. It's another fold out sleeve. I really hate these, as they're harder to get the disc out -- especially when you're trying to swap CD's at a stop light.<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />This CD is a kick in the face that keeps you tapping your feet/head banging/doing the truffle shuffle while this album plays on repeat. I simply can't get enough of this album. It's fantastic! Antrax is back!
B006OAB2XO|5.0|Visions is Grimes first album for the legendary label 4AD, and Clare Boucher's third album under the moniker Grimes. I recently found a copy of Visions at my local record store's annual garage sale. I immediately bought it because I have been wanting to hear it for some time now after hearing a few tracks off the album online. I am glad I did. The music is totally different and refreshing from what I normally listen to or have ever heard. Certainly not for everyone given how high pitched Clare's vocals can be and the beats and melodies veers into the experimental/electronica territory. If you are looking for something different, I definitely recommend Visions.

B005KELW26|5.0|I absolutely love this cover!  I had bought one that was supposed to fold into a stand and it collapsed all the time.  While this one doesn't fold it is easy to carry and has a little flap on the left where I have put the occasional business card.  It is soft on the inside to protect my Kindle Fire (which I also just love!) and it isn't heavy or clumsy.  A great value!
B004EWEX9Y|2.0|The product was disappointing because it only allows you to play videos on your I-pad; it doesn't allow you to use apps or do web browsing.  The seller was pleasant to work with, however.  The product arrived in new condition and came on time.

0743496736|1.0|What a vile, depressing, monotonous string of horrors. There cannot be *that* many unbalanced people living in the entire world, let alone one small community. This book is so very poorly written, with the obligatory but glurgy romance between the main adult character and the white knight on a steed, who fails utterly to provide deliverance for anyone. The kids in this horrid train wreck of a story are obnoxious and loathesome....except for Peter, whose actions certainly fit that description, but who acted out of psychosis induced by (see description of other characters, above). If this book brought redemption in any way, if it showed healing, or remorse, or love; if it brought evil out of good or in any way redeemed itself or the story line, it might have had some value. As it is written, is just about 500 pages too much of pointless, repetitive, violent writing, lacking in insight and lacking in forgiveness.
0307592731|5.0|A very well written page turner about the authors real life experience that was a therapeutic life changer. I am not much of a hiker but Cheryl Strayed brings every moment of joy and pain as if you are there, sharing her experience mile by mile without dragging any part of the story. Her descriptions of her psychological and emotional transformation s bring you right there. Highly recommend, you don't need to be a hiker to appreciate. My husband, who is a hiker, also loved it.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I really enjoyed this Reacher and was surprised to see so many negative reviews. (Some need to have a spoiler alert tag but then so does the general description.) This was not the best Reacher novel but certainly not the weakest.  I think it's definitely worth the purchase and Lee Child is showing fewer signs of being tired of his character than he was two novels ago. The characters are all interesting, although a few might have been fleshed out a little better and there was plenty of action.  The weakest link was that I didn't really understand the protagonists very well in this one but I did appreciate the inter-agency distrust and how the bureaucracy prevented a more prompt agency response.  But there's plenty of action and suspense. And Reacher and very Reacher like although to a new reader they might wonder why he hung around instead of continuing to Virginia.<br /><br />I'd like to encourage Lee to keep writing Reacher. If they never are 5 stars again, I'd still want to pre-order everyone.  I'm not sure that some of the disappointment can't be found in the fact that we who are fans do anticipate the next one and want Lee Child to hit one out of the park each time with the bases loaded.  Reacher is an interesting mix of high physical and cerebral power and energy.  I love that he's pragmatic yet passionate about what his  role should be. I love that he's such a contradiction.  He's so trustworthy and yet, who in their right might would pick this man up on the side of the road?  That said, I have to add, I cannot imagine 5'6\\" Tom Cruise playing 6'5\\" Reacher when his size is as much a part of his character as his dogged determination.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Until four weeks ago I heard nothing about this band and now they are everywhere.  I suppose it is for good reason though, the band is great and brings a good coldplay-retro-onerepublic vibe that is quite enjoyable.  Give it a few months and the song \\"Radioactive\\" will be in movie trailers starring angsty teenagers I guarantee you.  This CD is a great introduction to the world to Imagine Dragons and it will be awesome to see what else they come out with in the future.<br /><br />5 Stars!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I stopped watching TV in 2007, so I only buy & watch DVD's. I came across CASTLE by accident on Amazon.com & bought the first season, as it sounded good. I have since purchased all 4 seasons. I find the show VERY enjoyable & entertaining, & have looked forward to each show. Although I have enjoyed all 4 seasons, I find the 4th season to be the most enjoyable so far. The shows have been well written, & many of them I found fun. I especially liked the episode THE BLUE BUTTERFLY. The only thing I'm not happy about is I will probably have to wait a year before season 5 comes out on DVD, but I am looking forward to it! There are also several \\"extras\\" on season 4.
0385344333|3.0|This was Ok, but not one of Childs best, though it did hold my attention. Typical Jack Reacher, though less beatings and more shootings. I think this was the first time that Jack had to deal with terrorists. My biggest problem was how things are \\"wrapped up\\" in the explanation of some of the characters, not to mention the story, in the last few pages. I also found the explanation for what the bad guys doing very implausible, not to mention the actions of some of the \\"good guys\\".

B00992CF6W|4.0|minecraft pocket edition is great. there are a few less options than pc version. one issue with this version is that im unable to collect redstone after I mine it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|The game is really fun and very well made. The only negative thing about this game is all of the waiting. You only have so many energy points and it takes 3 mine to regenerate one point. So you can really only play it for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I know, walking into one of these disaster films, that they tend to be really stupid.  You can't get away from that fact.  They are mostly nonsensical and require a boatload of suspension of disbelief.  Roland Emmerich's name in general also doesn't instill much confidence, and yet, he's helmed a few noteworthy entries in the catalog of disaster films.  I mean, the genre as a whole is usually under thought and over produced, and yet we all love ourselves some mindless explosions every once in a while.  Emmerich himself has given us Independence Day, Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow, and while none of those films are `great', they are certainly entertaining for the genre being considered.<br /><br />Why Emmerich felt the need to make this film, when he had previously made The Day After Tomorrow, which is similarly structured, is beyond me.<br /><br />The idea of the end of the world coming in 2012 is not a new one.  It is largely misquoted and misapplied in this film, but who cares.  The general idea is that the planets align and the world is destroyed and starts over basically and so this film takes us on a journey following a fractured family as they work together to weather the storm so-to-speak and mend broken bridges.<br /><br />This film is terrible.<br /><br />The general idea is decent yet hugely overproduced to the point where the visuals aren't even interesting anymore.  Watching LA implode was redundant and watching the limo fly through the air and swerve out of harm's way was ridiculous to the point of unintentional comedy.  In fact, almost all the visuals were laced with so much preposterousness that they wound up heavily detracting from the film.  Not to mention that the human dynamics were sappy and dumbed down, the endless barrage of rekindled family goodbyes was simply boring and pointless and the ridiculous connection between the end of the world and this washed up author's book (and the love affair Ejiofor's character has with it) is silly, pretentious and nauseating.  The acting is also all really poor, with the usually fascinating Ejiofor sapping all the life out of this film with his overacting and Woody Harrelson serving up one of the most ridiculous performances I've seen in years.  Oh, and Zlatko Buric is just gross, which brings me to the fact that this film is also offensively racist in parts, but whatever.<br /><br />The predictability of the whole thing is also bizarrely obvious (whoever things that Gordon has a chance of survival when he stands in the way of Jackson and Kate rekindling their happy family is an idiot) and the final scene of suspense (and that collision with Mount Everest) was just overdone and silly.<br /><br />This whole movie was silly.<br /><br />Want a pickle?entious and nauseating.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great fun. makes me feel young again playing the original game. hope everyone has great fun playing this game and if trail on to something else
034580404X|5.0|very intertaining and interesting. I know many people are criticizing \\"certain\\" sexual ways and behaviors in this book...but this book is, perhaps, describing someone's real life and there are many people out there who have certain problems that they are trying to overcome...in this book Christian's problem is what it is...luckily he had found someone who is helping him through it and becasue of Ana he is trying to be a better person and overcome his habits. Looking beyond negative actions and behaviors in this book, there is a real love story in it and real life problems...keeps you wanting to read till the end...Love the book because there is a happy ending to it which in real life many times isn't. At least you can be happy for someone even if it is fictional caracter.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Not only did I read it over the weekend, but I began it again and now I'm reading slowly.  I love the characters, they are so well developed!  Jamie (Author) is very adept at giving you just enough angst to feel their struggle, and just enough love to route for them!  Even the less focused on characters are exceptionally full and visual.  I felt like I lived in their life, and now I miss them.  Travis is the leading male I've been looking for... He makes me realize that Love is worth the risks and that person has to be your best friend!  Warning:  He isn't perfect people, he's human.  Pidge is refreshing. I find alot of female roles end up falling into one of 2 catagories:  Pathetic or Popular... Abby Abernathy is neither.  She's a wondeful balance.  She's confident but has worries, she knows he's attracted to her, but to what extent? She doesn't doubt that she's sexy and accepts \\"his\\" words at face value... I love the fact that she is not always over analyzing things. She makes a decision based on how she feels about it.  That's normal. She doesn't hide what she has to say, I think this is why they work.  Letting it be what it is... Not the typical good & bad here... they're both flawed and it's been a delight watching them put their pieces together!<br />Let me add... that I did NOT see what was coming. I think that's very important in a review. You know they love each other yes... but with all the \\"disasters\\" and the way the rides just keep on coming, you truely worry at the end. Will they make it? That it is NOT clear... You can't have the thrill without the ride, so just read it!<br /><br />Congrats Jamie M.  I can't wait to read Travis's POV & The \\"Beautiful\\" stories to come!!!
1587613379|5.0|Bought the kindle version and loved it so much, I bought the paper version. These women are funny, articulate, kind and informative.<br />I would recommend for anyone who wants to be on relationship- whether poly or not. Great insight on honesty, clarity and respect..<br />A must have...
B00846TTDG|5.0|My husband heard about this movie from friends, and kept waiting and waiting for it to come out. We finally decided to check on the internet. It was well worth the money! Very good movie! :)
B008XG1X18|1.0|This app freezes every time I use it and I have to foreclose.  It is really annoying. I dont have this problem with any other app on my kindle fire. Please fix!
B0081HLM2E|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews, unless they really jump out at me.  This was an ASTONISHING move!  Through the entire move, and up until the very end, we didn't know what was going to happen. Although it may seem as if it's starting a little slow, the action picks up until something is happening every minute.  Pretty violent, which often puts me off, but this movie had me hooked (even though I did close my eyes at times.)  The actors were fantastic, and I LOVED the ending.<br /><br />Very very highly recommend!
B004UID2LC|1.0|it did work for awhile and was great... now nothing cant do anything with it..... going to have to find a different app..
B0015F1VY8|5.0|I really enjoyed the first Elizabeth movie and this one was equally great. I love that it showed both her flaws and strengths, especially as a woman. This one has some amazing shots as well. My favorite was when Elizabeth stands at the cliff watching the ships battle. Although her romances were always tragic, I really admire that the films show her ability to ultimately stand above them.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Waited all summer for the chance to see the season 4. As soon as it was available on Amazon, bought it. It was worth the wait!
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|The first thing I am going to say is had I seen this movie in the theater I would have been pissed. I think that Chris Hemsworth's and Charlize Theron are two very talented actors( the only reason I did not give it one star), but would somebody please tell me why Kristen Stewart gets millions for doing movies. If sucking in your breath and popping a tear out of your eye and mumbling your lines is all that is required then I qualify to be an actress. I started watching and Snow White as a little girl was alright. Then cut to the grown-up and yuck. As long as she does not talk it is better. Frankly, I could not wait for Chris Hemsworth to show up on screen, and as far as I am concerned he did not show up fast enough. The one funny line has The Huntsman cutting away her dress and she looks at him like she thinks he is going to ravage her. He looks at her and says \\" don't flatter yourself\\". That sums up just about everything about her. Watching them plod through the forest is torture.  The actors who play the dwarves are hilarious, they steal the movie. The scene where the two male leads talk about the inner light of Snow White and how you have to be blind not to see it, made me wonder if they got through that without gagging. To be blunt the most exciting thing about the movie was finding out she was not so snowy white and was sleeping with the director. I saw they were planning a sequel and I would like to know what for? I do believe they are plotting a spin-off for the huntsman, and if Chris Hemsworth is doing it I will be the first in line. Just not more of this same drivel. I would have to be as drunk as the huntsman to see that.
B009329ZF2|3.0|The Movie starts out slow and builds. But there is no sense of realism and the CGI is over the Top.It is fun to watch if you are bored, but on an increasing scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 4.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I first saw this movie trailer when I saw Haywire. I did not really know who Channing Tatum was(dumb me), let alone he was in Haywire. I thought a male stripper movie. I have seen  my share of male strippers and if it was going to be like watching the Chippendales, I thought how boring. Well it came out and it was going strong at the theater in July so what the hell, I went and saw it. All I can say is WOW it was raining men and and hot bods and man candy. Definitely not boring. Channing Tatum can definitely move and the dance in the red thong is Oh My God. We women finally get something decent to look at, after all the years of enduring movies where chicks get naked and the guys are drooling. So the guys get to suck it up. Seeing Channing Tatum's naked rear-end and just about everything else, makes your mouth drop open. He is drop dead gorgeous and sexy as hell and the rest are not bad on the eyes either. Joe Mangianello from True Blood is holy crap hot too. It was a pretty decent story too, not just stripping. I love the strip to KISS's Dr. Love. That was a topper for me. I highly recommend this movie to every red-blooded female out there. When Channing Tatum goes dressed as a cop to strip for the college girls it makes you want to do bad things to get arrested by him. I don't know why anybody should be surprised that this movie has done well, any woman with working eyes has seen it and probably more than once. It is still in the theaters around my home town as this is written. If it was just a dumb stripper movie, in my opinion, it would have been gone by July 1st, not spend 3 months in the theater. I can hardly wait for the sequel.
B008CP92ZO|1.0|The video quality for this was awful, not even close to HD. Asked for a credit but got no response. One star for the quality, would give the movie as a whole 3 stars, it was funny.
0345803485|3.0|I am having a hard time getting through this book. The writing is less than average. How did this woman become an author? Boring. Everyone says you have to read the first book because the 2nd and 3rd are the ones with the storylines. But how much torture do i have to endure?
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, read the whole thing in one long, rainy day.  One of the best fantasy adventure books I have read in a very long time.  A well written, well crafted and thought out story.  Just the right amount of detail, character development, challenge, and action.  I highly recommend it for those who enjoy fantasy adventure books!
0307960471|4.0|Everything you could have wanted to know about drug addiction...the druggies, the drugs, how they make the stuff and sell it and snort it and smoke it and stick it in their veins....is in Phantom.  This does not necessarily make for enjoyable afternoon reading in the park, but you will pretty much know everything about the drug world you ever wanted to know by the time you put this book down.<br /><br />You may even decide to become a drug addict yourself.  In fact, Phantom has made me decide to become a drug addict.  At age 100.  My pusher is going to be a sexy young thing in her mid forties, slinking around in black tights and high heels.  She can cash my Medicare checks as long as she keeps an eye on my stash.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo is a great writer.  Even if Nesbo wrote a clunker it would be better than 95% of the books out there today.  Not that Phantom is a clunker...by no means...but it is not Nesbo at his best.  He tried to put too much into Phantom.  I think he was writing with an eye to making a movie out of the book, which in itself is not a bad thing, but this movie has scenes from James Bond (pick your flick,) Raiders of The Lost Ark,  Casablanca, and probably Panic In Needle Park.. which gets mentioned by name and which I think is the name of a movie, but I'm not quite sure.<br /><br />The escape scenes are a bit implausible... for example, you are sure the hero gets killed in one scene, but he turns out to have been saved by an empty whiskey bottle.  And the romance triangle, presumably a la Casablanca, would never have been enacted by Humphrey Bogart, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca the way it gets enacted in this book.  The strength of the scenes in the movie between Bogart and Henried lies in the fact that the two men never speak to each other of their love for Ingrid Bergman.  The relationship hovers over them creating a wonderful tension.  In Phantom the two male parts of the triangle get kind of blubbery with each other.  Real men don't do this kind of thing.<br /><br />Then there are the coincidences: there are just too many of them.  The most implausible coincidence (SPOILER WARNING, SPOILER WARNING) is that both our hero, Harry Hole (isn't that a great name for a detective?  I am told that in Norwegian the surname Hole is pronounced Hou-lay or something like that, but come on...they should pronounce it like Americans do...Harry HOLE)  (That was just a pause for you to reflect on the fact that what's coming next is a SPOILER for some...)  Well, both Harry Hole, our hero, and his protagonist villain (who shall remain unnamed,) have come to Oslo because of their sons.  And (here's the real kicker,)  their sons are best buddies!!!<br /><br />Well, if you can accept that kind of coincidence without guffawing, you will love this book.  I was with the guffawers.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo always informs us of interesting stuff.  In Phantom you will learn about a link between aspirin and heroin, for instance, which is worth the price of the book itself.  You will learn the meanings of various body tattoos to members of the Russian crime world.  You will learn the meanings or derivations of interesting words such as Cassock.  This is typical Nesbo stuff.  So there is plenty of redeeming value in the book.  I simply think it is not Nesbo at his best, and I hope the movie they make of the book earns Nesbo a fortune.  And yeah, I will definitely go see the movie.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Ridley Scott's legendary attention to detail is on full display here, although I couldn't help but wish for a more complete, uninhibited storyline to go along with it. For all his promises that this wouldn't just be a direct prequel to Alien, the director sure seems to stretch this concept to bring the two films together, rarely to the benefit of either. That's a pity, because while the core questions that Prometheus has to ask are worthwhile if not unique, its constant urge to poke and prod several of Alien's richest, most eccentric mysteries keep it tethered to the ground floor. A more compassionate cast may have smoothed over some of those rough spots, but this tight squad of explorers is thoroughly cold and conniving, naive and unlikable at their best. I wanted to adore this, and for the whole of the concept-heavy first act I did, but by the onset of the final standoff I'd been bucked like a fledgling cowboy. Fantastic, breathtaking special effects, stirring atmosphere and an astounding vision of near-future tech can only go so far.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|This was such a great product. It was the perfect size and made all the difference in making my Audio Technica ATHM50 headphones sound great with a little Sansa Clip player.

B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Canada the novel got a great review in the New Yorker and that's why I bought it. The result - underwhelming. Ford's interesting premise is drowned in multiple restatements of his narrator's thoughts. How many times need we be told that Arthur is strange and remote or that... I can't give another example because the book was so dull I've already forgotten most of it. A chore to get thru, save your eyes.

0143119680|5.0|What can I say, I'm obsessed. It is truly a different experience reading a book from a well educated professor than from someone who doesn't even know how to write a complete sentence yet puts a bunch of mushy smut down on paper and gets to call it a best selling novel. Harkness knows her stuff and she uses her background and education to enhance her writing. This is a \\"supernatural\\" novel that even those who hate the genre could enjoy. And for me (who likes that stuff) FINALLY, an adult version of the genre! I found myself so intrigued by all the history, alchemy, book references, and even just the geography of Oxford, that I had my kindle in my lap reading and my iPad beside me to research everything I didn't know about as I went along through my SECOND reading of the novel. I'm sure the people who didn't like book just found all the academic references and history daunting, which is understandable, but it was what I enjoyed most from this book. I didn't just enjoy the story, I learned many things from it I never would have thought about, let alone been interested in, before. Just give it a chance, I promise you won't be disappointed!

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is my first time reading anything by Clare and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I see now why all the stir about her books. Clare has the ability to suffuse the ordinary with the extraordinary, like grafting two species together and creating something new and unique. Even if City of Bones and its sequels stopped there I would still give it five stars. But it doesn't. Clare deals with some very sticky issues within all those fantastic pages, everything from homosexuality to bullying to prejudice. I would not recommend it to audiences younger than sixteen.

B0059XTTW8|1.0|I wanted to like this movie.  Had not read the book but enjoy these types of stories.  I just could not make it past the first 45 minutes.  The movie moved at the speed of slow, and seemed to relish keeping the audience confused for a long, long time.  I did not find this amusing.  I don't need light fluff that puts the storyline right in my face, but I cannot tolerate this pretentious garbage.  Ok, director, you know the story line and I don't and you want to remind me of that for at least half the movie.  Go away.  I don't have time for this, nor do I want to try that hard - I watch movies for entertainment.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|I began hearing about Emeli Sande earlier this year when a UK blogger posted a few of her live performances and VH1 put her video for NEXT TO ME on heavy rotation.  Emeli has such a beautiful sweet voice that perfectly conveys emotion in her songs and while she probably could have chased the current trend of dance-pop music, instead she chose to craft more soulful songs with heartfelt lyrics about love (which never goes out of style in my opinion).<br /><br />The songs I really like are: HEAVEN - great way to start the album off; MOUNTAINS - inspirational ballad; MAYBE - although a breakup song, the production isn't mournful; BREAKING THE LAW - I love her phrasing and how effortlessly she hits the higher notes in this almost folksy sounding song; NEXT TO ME - very catchy uptempo track; RIVER - beautiful spare ballad; HOPE - beautiful lyrics about hope for the world; READ ALL ABOUT IT - rousing track that closes out the album.<br /><br />This is a really good debut album from a talented singer/songwriter who I hope others will discover & give a chance to.

B008B0QH5S|5.0|there are so many dance, pop groups that just do dance and pop, over and over, after a while it all starts to sound the same. With Elysium, the PSB get it so right. Its so clear, so pure, it has heart and soul. I am so impressed with them after all these years they still can put out such great music. I had bought the regular I cd, but after I heard it, it was the words, but the music that moved me, I went back to the store and got the deluxe version and i love it. The first 3 songs are so well crafted, Leaving, Invisible and Winner, I was sold just by these first 3 songs. I love the sound and the vibe of this cd. You can hear by the words that our boys have grown older, like all of us and being a BIG fan, never missed a release, I feel this is there best cd in years. They got the sound and vocals down its smooth like silk, it flows so sweet and pure. I f your are a true fan, you will love this cd and understand where they are coming from. Age brings  new light and different feelings about life. I am so proud of our boys, I thought they would have just got caught up in mindless pop, but no. these are two smart boy, lol. or sound I say PET SHOP MEN. thats why this cd came in number 4 on the U.K charts. well done boys. to all the haters. they dont need your bad reviews, they have enough fan who are REAL fans who  love there work and great music. You go boys. I WANT MORE.

The author, Paul Torday, has penned a novel whose plot is making it possible for salmon to inhabit and spawn in the Yemen River in the eastern, desert-like nation country of Yemen.  Of course this is just about in the realm of the impossible but for a Yemeni Sheik who has the faith (and the funds) to make it happen and a respected fisheries scientist who can realize the Sheik's dream.  Torday develops the main characters nicely, providing enough detail to make them recognizable and he describes the scientific issues in enough detail so that one can understand where they fit in the story and the challenges of making it a reality.  The story itself is wonderful describing a fantasy and its transformation to reality and then it's set against the reality of today's world of sleazy politics and religious fanaticism.  All-in-all, a nicely written and short novel that is interesting and keeps your interest.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool - Omnibus Edition (Wool 1-5)<br /><br />This is a beautifully crafted and written science fiction/post-apocalyptic series of 5 stories. The characters are engaging and the situation, as it unfolds in layers upon layers, is gripping. The first of the stories starts quietly, then rips the rug out from under the reader.<br /><br />What struck me after finishing the series was how the first book contained all the elements of the whole story. They're all there, just as hints. So, when in books three and four the reader finds information about what IT are doing, happenings in book one come into focus.<br /><br />There's a style of storytelling I enjoy ‒ characters dealing with the aftermath of some momentous happening and the protagonist and the reader learn as they go what the implications are. This is one of those stories.<br /><br />A very well crafted tale. But, much more than that. The writing is clean and elegant. The storytelling all I could ask for. I'll be back for more.

B0053O89KG|2.0|I used to so love this show. I would never be anywhere on Monday nights but home for Castle. Not anymore. It has fallen so deeply into cop show cliche that I can barely stand it. This will be my last purchase of a Castle season as it has enough of an ending to finish my collection. I won't be a continuing viewer. I don't care about this pair anymore.<br /><br />  What happened? Why did it go from a light, funny, romantic mystery series to just another dark, gritty, urban cop show? Probably because the writers couldn't resist throwing in the most overused plot device of tv cop show catalogs, the psycho/drug gang killer who has targeted one cop,and/or their family, leaving the main character obsessed with revenge and risking their life and career to track down the killer, SO BORING. I had hoped after the bombing of Kate's apartment, a plot lifted from Remington Steele, that they would wind up that storyline and get back to creatively solving murders with humor and charm, but no. The writers had to damage and kill off other close friends of Kate's and take a shot at Kate, oh yes, and they had to try a comic book spinoff to darken it further. And the new captain? Oh well what else, a crusty curmudgeon. The show wrote in a young more attractive one, but still a standard cop show character. Every season but this one ended with Kate in danger and Castle walking away. Once again, SO BORING!<br /><br />  What made this series interesting to me was that it had a hopeful pair of romantically attracted characters with plenty of spark and humor. It was romantic and charming, with unusual if not funny cases. Now it has a pair of dull, damaged, everyday, gritty cops, who work realistic city street murders and gang murders without much mystery. Kate is obsessed with her mother's killer even if she dies searching for the psychos who have drawn a target on her. Kate and Castle have become just another set of common tv forensic detective characters with predictable dark emotional edges who might, or might not, work out their differences to live/marry/or work together before Kate finds out the truth, probably as she dies in Castle's arms, or is pushed out of the way of the bullet by a mortally wounded Castle as he protects her. Either way, so predictible. So dull.<br /><br />  The cases they work now while acting out this plot are average murders not society or locked room mysteries. Even the sets are dark and classless. What happened to all the upper crust settings, writer cameos, celebrity cameos, glamour, sparkle, wit, quirky connections,and party murders that connected the Castle character to the mysteries? Where's the champagne? Now it's only morning coffee and dull faces. They might as well have married them off in the first season. Who done it? Who cares?<br /><br />  This show attracted viewers to a fantasy, not a reality type cop series. I've had enough with the rain, the tears, the dark dirty sets, the obsession, and the angst. Thats' not what started me watching this show. This viewer is turning away. Series four finishes my collection with their passion satisfied giving me an acceptable end to it. When I watch Castle now I will go back the early episodes to enjoy a light romantic mystery or dig out my old copies of Remington Steele or MacMillan and Wife.s who might, or might not, work out their differences to live/marry/or work together before Kate finds out the truth, probably as she dies in Castle's arms, or is pushed out of the way of the bullet by a mortally wounded Castle as he protects her.

B007MU85D0|5.0|Yep, pretty much that! I initially looked this up because I thought it was Jack and Meg White. These guys are pretty talented!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|...and a hell of a storm is upon us.  \\"It's gonna sweep my world away,\\" but it gets worse -- \\"It's gonna blow the sky apart.\\"  While \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" is a cheerful, toe-tapping number, the lyrics are anything but carefree.  TEMPEST is an apocalyptic vision, which is quite appropriate given A) that the world is supposed to end in December 2012 according to a widespread misinterpretation of the Mayan calendar, and B) the reality of catastrophic climate change, which we are headed toward like a runaway train.<br /><br />Dylan is no longer the blue-eyed son, \\"goin' out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'.\\"  He is now the grizzled old man, making his way through the storm, which is growing stronger by the day.  He can now sing \\"I was so much younger then, I'm older than that now.\\"  Yes, he gave up his role as protest singer and prophet long ago.  His latter-day persona has been the roving gambler with pencil-thin mustache, the worldly rogue, a God-fearing man fully immersed in the profane world and its pleasures.<br /><br />But the prophet still speaks, and it is perhaps the more prominent place of that submerged voice that makes TEMPEST more compelling to me than his acclaimed recent Trilogy.  In \\"Narrow Way,\\" a great propulsive shuffle, Dylan mentions \\"the bleeding wound in the heart of town.\\"  Is he talking to God when he says \\"If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday\\"?  The song is full of \\"Isis\\"-style bravado, but a friend tells him \\"Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.\\"<br /><br />The dark heart of the album runs from \\"Pay In Blood\\" through \\"Scarlet Town\\" and \\"Early Roman Kings\\" to \\"Tin Angel.\\"  In these songs, Dylan clearly dons the mask of evil.  \\"Pay In Blood\\" is another pleasant-sounding tune, featuring steel guitar, but Dylan sings in the voice of the Devil, rasping and choking.  \\"I pay in blood, but not my own.\\"  \\"The more I die, the more I live.\\"  Could this be the Wall Street bankers getting bailed out?  The State sending young troops to die?  \\"Scarlet Town\\" features banjo and fiddle, as well as a nice guitar solo, one of the few on the album.  When Dylan sings \\"all things are beautiful in their time\\" in this very dark setting, the listener can't help but sense that everything is broken and degraded, that actually *nothing* is beautiful.  These songs suggest to me that Dylan may have been reading Cormac McCarthy, in particular [[ASIN:B004UM9UAA Blood Meridian]], his epic novel of American violence.  \\"Early Roman Kings\\" is a slow, relaxed, loping, and altogether excellent rendition of the well-known riff used by Muddy Waters for \\"Mannish Boy.\\"  In it \\"peddlers and meddlers destroyed your city, and they'll destroy you too.\\"  Could this refer to Halliburton?  When Dylan sings \\"I could strip you of life, strip you of breath,\\" he sounds to me like McCarthy's character The Judge from \\"Blood Meridian.\\"<br /><br />I don't find the last three songs to be especially compelling.  \\"Tin Angel,\\" which features banjo, is a story of a love triangle which ends badly.  The main character, known only as \\"The Boss,\\" is another despicable character, one who orders the use of \\"the cheapest labor money can buy.\\"  The epic \\"Tempest\\" is the story of the sinking of the Titanic, complete with Leonardo DiCaprio.  If Dylan is not using the Titanic as a metaphor for society steaming toward ecological doom then he is more oblivious to the world around him than I consider to be very likely.  His persona inhabits the past, a timeless past of Americana, but the songs of evil on TEMPEST are clearly informed by \\"modern times.\\"  Musically the song has little variation, but there are three instrumental breaks.  The first two feature fiddle, and the final reprise without fiddle after God's hand has rendered judgement on \\"good, bad, rich, and poor\\" is poignant for its absence.<br /><br />Dylan's road-tested band sounds great, with Tony Garnier on bass, George G. Receli on drums, Donnie Herron on steel guitar, banjo, violin &mandolin, Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball on guitar, and David Hidalgo sitting in on guitar, accordion, and violin.  The music they play is simple and solid, blending blues and rock with a little country flavoring.<br /><br />*** *** ***<br /><br />I have been one of the few apparently impervious to Dylan's charms since his comeback beginning in 1997.  I don't have anything bad to say about the latter-day Trilogy (Time Out of Mind, Love & Theft, Modern Times), they just haven't spoken to me.  I can't really say why I find TEMPEST more compelling when it's the same band and sounds so similar.<br /><br />The best I can offer is that the dark, apocalyptic mood rings my bell.<br /><br />(REVIEW #90 -- 9/17/12)mandolin, Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball on guitar, and David Hidalgo sitting in on guitar, accordion, and violin.

B0098VYCCE|3.0|I am warning you up front, this WILL contain ****SPOILER ALERTS**** and since I don't want to stop and type it in at every point, don't read my review if you don't want spoilers about this movie.<br /><br />First the bad: I looked at this movie through the eyes of one who isn't a fan of any of the people in it or directing it. I couldn't honestly give it 5 stars because the story between Snow and the Huntsman and Snow's One True Love was a bit clumsy and changing a beloved fairy tale was jumping the shark (IMHO). Putting the unnecessary scenes aside (the trip to the woman's only camp? Still in the dark on the why of that one), the walk through the fairy forest and then being attacked by the evil Queen's henchmen? I don't know, maybe I'm a hopeless hopeful, but it seems to me, the fairies would have warned them it was coming, but what do I know. The fact that the Great Snow pulled together her own army after being kissed NOT by her One True Love, but the Huntsman who I'm not sure we even know who he is anyway, even to the end, where he stands at the back of the \\"church\\" whilst Snow is crowned ends up in a big mess. The entire ending scene was a big question mark to me. Why was it all so slow and odd? The Seven Dwarves? I didn't get that either. There were other :-O throughout the movie, but I'm tired so I'll go on to the good.<br /><br />I think Charlize Theron was spectacular in her role as the evil queen. She scared me to death, that's for sure. I thought the cinematography was quite wonderful throughout the entire movie. I actually thought Kristen Stewart was quite good as Snow White. In fact, I can't fault any of the actors at all. It's the STORY that was the problem. The beautiful parts intertwining with the dark parts could have been done SO MUCH BETTER. Sometimes when you mess with a storyline that works, you don't end up with something better. Had the director stuck to the actual storyline we all know and love about Snow White, with the beautiful CGI and the amazing cast he had at his disposal, I think we would have seen a 5-star movie. I wanted so badly to give this 4 stars, but in the end, there were more questions than answers, it could have been a MUCH better movie given the looks of the amount of money these producers and the director had to spend on it.<br /><br />This movie should have been at LEAST a 4-star movie with the support it had in cast, money and CGI - and it's so disappointing that, to me, it was quite wasted. When will these Hollywood people learn that when our world is in so much turmoil, we want to be swept away with familiar entertainment, not some new twist we have to think about? They truly need to go out and hobnob amongst the unwashed masses and ask us what we WANT if they want to stop wasting money needlessly and start making lots and lots of money again? Considering a lot of us out here are without jobs, without the ability to pay our bills, we would LOVE to have the money wasted on this movie. The money would have been better spent just sending each jobless family a check in the mail. Sorry - just my opinion. And it's not one I want to have. I WANTED this movie to be great! Quite frankly, I am being generous giving it 3 stars. Because in my heart, that's how much I wanted this movie to be great.amazing cast he had at his disposal, I think we would have seen a 5-star movie.

B001NFNFNA|1.0|I lasted 30 minutes with this mess. The minute she took \\"the boy\\" home I should have turned it off. The minute she saw he was circumcised and kept him anyway I should have turned it off. The minute she was being told by a doctor that kids shrink when they are under stress I DID turn it off.<br /><br />I have to agree with the low reviews that the \\"period\\" seems more like a distraction and a reason for Angelie to play \\"dress up\\" than having any real impact on anything...If this movie is based on a True Story as it says, this mother IMO was too dense to even have a kid, it should have been taken.<br /><br />The script was bad enough but the acting was appalling.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am so glad I borrowed this book from a friend.  There was no plot...NONE.  It was all about the sex.  Okay, I did not read the reviews before borrowing the book, I just heard that it was a best seller and I enjoy a good read, especially after a long day with 4 kids.  I figured the plot would show up sometime.. but after finishing about a fourth of the book, I had to set it down and return it to my friend.  It was discusting!  I even tried to skip pages to get past the nasty parts but I only ran into a different scene, same act.  Next time, I will pay attention to the reviews and won't start reading just because it's a best seller.  Lesson learned...
1451696191|4.0|Read a review of this which said it is a very popular YA book and since it was short - an afternoon read - it became a nice break this weekend. Would Harold Bloom ever look at this? I am afraid not. Is it really for YA? In some respects, if it is, it is frightening. So much more \\"drama\\" must be going on in young people's lives. Frankly, it would be a rough description of early years at college. In some ways it is similar to Tom Wolfe's \\"I am Charlotte Simons\\" - though no one reads that in an afternoon. This is going to be a movie soon? That will probably not be worth another afternoon. But for some YA this may be a very important book. I hope not for too many, but for those it addresses they need it pretty badly.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|A harsh winter is followed by the invasion of a dark and mysterious army that lures the King into battle to protect his kingdom. The dark soldiers shatter like glass in battle and they were defeated by the King and his army. Ravenna (Charlize Theron) was a prisoner in a wagon held in the dark army camp and the King saw her beauty and married her. Ravenna is a witch and she kills the king to steal his kingdom. She unlocks the kingdom's gates to let her brother and his army into the city. The entire town is at war and Snow White is trapped in the city and the Queen imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in a tower.<br /><br />The Queen has two men hang a huge polished dish on the wall. It is a living metal mirror with magical powers. The mirror flows onto the floor and becomes a cloaked man of metal. He tells her she is the fairest of them all. The Queen absorbs the life force from other women to stay young and she wants to live forever. The Queen then has all of the people in the city slain except for Snow White.....<br /><br />I love movies of all types and I rarely rate them poorly but this movie was just lacking on many levels. It possibly has one of the worst scripts for a major motion picture I have ever seen. I looked it up and the movie cost over $170 million to make and you would think they would have spent more on the script. Kristen Stewart didn't say 10 words until the middle of the movie and then I wish she had kept her mouth shut. She acted stiffly and bored and like she was reading from cue cards off the set. The only saving grace for this movie was the beautiful Charlize Theron and even she could not save this film. While at times she performed her role perfectly there were other times that her character was just over the top of expected reality. I can only attribute that to poor directing.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it to you as a good movie. If you like Charlize Theron then you should see it but otherwise it is not a real entertaining film. The length of the film is about 2 hours and 11 minutes and it should have been cut by 30 minutes.ngth of the film is about 2 hours and 11 minutes and it should have been cut by 30 minutes.

He thinks Varinius has more potential in the senate than Glaber ever will achieve.<br /><br />Crixus is captured by the Roman soldiers. They bring Crixus and two other gladiator captives before Glaber and he has them put into cells.<br /><br />Roman soldiers are in the fog and forest looking for the gladiators and Naevia from the mine. The gladiators and slaves are hidden but Naevia panics and the soldiers attack. Mira kills a soldier who is going to kill Naevia.  The gladiators kill the soldiers but one gladiator is killed and the surviving number dwindles dangerously low.<br /><br />Lucretia continues to speak for the gods in prophecies that seem to always come true while Llithyia betrays her husband, Glaber, for the affection of a more powerful man......<br /><br />This episode begins to show the deception of many characters who are always trying to gain advantage and power for themselves.  The plot thickens and the action continues at a feverish pace.  I enjoyed this episode.  I recommend it to you.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|If you like the \\"Transformer\\" movies, you will love \\"Battleship.\\" Period. Some belly laughs, lots of great military action, buff athletic men and women performing impossible tasks against incompetent alien invaders. Some neat camios by vets and my favorite battleship, the USS Missouri.<br /><br />Sure, we are required to ignore the usual pesky things like physics (uh, anybody heard of the speed of light? Anyone?). Then traveling between the stars, but crashing into an orbiting satellite? Does anyone really believe that a race capable of waging interstellar war would need more than 15 minutes to destroy mankind? And does anyone believe that the undisciplined lead guy would be placed in command of a destroyer--EVER?<br /><br />That said, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this fun movie. We watched it on Amazon streaming video as a lark, but rapidly got engrossed and kept saying how much we were enjoying this movie. I put in an order for the Blu-ray version before the final credits. Like I said, it is what it is. Five stars if you like the Transformer movies. Steer clear if you are looking for sparkling dialog and deep meaning of life stuff.
0880796863|5.0|It is perfect for beginners or people who have been using them for awhile. I recommend this one for sure!
B007XF0X6G|5.0|Just received this today and spent a fun afternoon watching it. Had already seen this in 2D and 3D (an aussie copy) and I'm sure the 3D in the american copy was better, maybe just imagination. Anyway it is a thoroughly enjoyable action fantasy movie with great 3D and is a definite improvement on the original. Also the amazon copy played in australia for anyone interested. Great fun, good value and fun 3D cover.

B0088RQ4X4|2.0|A lot of effort went into the production of this movie, but it was jumbled and bland. It wasn't terrible enough to be funny, but it wasn't good enough to be very entertaining for me either. Although I didn't love it, it could appeal to other people, and it didn't deserve to bomb at the box office like it did.<br /><br />Pros: There wasn't too much language or graphic situations, and it inspired me to check out the books it was based on.<br />Cons: The plot was confusing, and the movie was long.<br /><br />9/24/12 EDIT: I'm currently reading the book series, and I would have liked John Carter a lot more if I had read it first.

B0074YVW1G|5.0|Oh now I get it, there's nothing wrong with wanting to read instead of going to whatever party is happening. Our social conditioning would have us believe otherwise. This book contains a timely message for all of us no matter where we sit along the introvert, ambivert, extrovert spectrum, but especially for anyone who is an introvert, or knows/works/loves one, and seeing that a third to half of us are introverts, that's everyone.

B0026NBZEY|4.0|It took me about 50% of the book before I actually started to enjoy it.  The book begins with a woman, Margaret, apparently suffering from depression, visiting a woman's prison as a type of social service.  The detail about the prison and the prisoner's lives is really well done, but the story builds a little slowly.  Margaret meets a prisoner who claims to be a medium/spiritualist who can contact ghosts.  Their relationship builds interestingly, and Margaret becomes a really interesting character.  There's a surprise twist at the end, which was pretty satisfying.<br /><br />I'm giving four stars because I liked the ending and as I look back at it, I realize that it was a very well written book.  If I'd stooped reading when I wanted to, I probably would have given only two stars.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|More Cosmic Funk From CRB!This album just like the first witch i love is a great 2nd cd. The first cd sounded much more like The Dead & yes this album still has some of the Dead feel but not as much as the first one. This album shows a little of another side of CRB. It's a little more rock and blues with the songs Let's Go & Someday Past the Sunset then Appaloosa i have heard before on Before The Frost from The Black Crowes but more of a early Yes type flow in this version. But then Vibration & Light Suite is a total cosmic trip & i can hear genesis The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway era & Pink Floyd that just jams then has cosmic sound effects at the end like early Pink Floyd. The first cd i am addicted to & this one as well. It has the same vibe because it was recorded during the same sessions. I say put both albums together in your ipod or cd player hit random & enjoy the mix up of these 2 albums together & you will be amazed. I just hope that there is more to come from CRB because now i'm hooked.

1611761565|5.0|This book was a fantastic review of the life of a SEAL and the operation that closed an ugly chapter in American history. It killed some of the myths and opened the curtain a little on the life of those who do the ugly jobs that few people have the will, stomach or tenacity to do. This chronicle places credit where it is due and there is no banner waving. Whether it is believed that this operator should or should not have written this is irrelevant, what is revealed is the single point where the boots hit the ground with all of the politics and boasting removed. This is an excellent work.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This movie is so funny! It's a movie we watch over and over again. We would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great comedy.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|very good book with plenty of information and i suspect grear referrencessince the making of the units whichever you use are not explained in great depth But a ver excellent source to start out from and decide how fanatical you want to do this .Holidays are nt good with this system unless i think you eat of give the fish away and shut down the operation till u come back if u take a longer holiday than normal
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I love, love, love Phantom and this is an outstanding show.<br />I love that you are able to see all the people that have participated in this production from it's inception on stage.<br />I highly recommend this to those who love Andrew Lloyd Weber and his shows.
B008JTK9NW|5.0|This album was on point for POD.  Some songs reminded me of the Satelite album which was really bangin.  Every song had a great message.  I highly recommend this album, it's worth every penny!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is hysterical.  She is (or appears) 100% comfortable in her own skin and it's admirable.  I loved her stories and how down-to-earth she really is.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to read it again - or another book by her (none yet, correct?!).  This has made me a bigger Tina Fey fan and truly a great read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|all.good.  big numbers..easy to use I would reccomend the app.  my favorite part is the wiper memory that makes a disco sound when you use it..amazing
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This was an excellent adaptation of the children's favorite - and one of my favorites. Make no mistake, it is an adaptation, but the additional story elements actually do compliment the original. And the visuals are as wacky and Dr. Seuss's hand drawings. If you enjoyed the book, you should enjoy this movie.
B0087HT36U|4.0|game is fun. not too challenging so far. looking forward to more levels. keep them coming soon please. thank you
B007TNS6JI|4.0|the game is just so fun I just cant stop playing it with  friends so fun with the trolls and stuff in it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it u could Dp different kinds of games on it it is a very good game 100 games in 1 yerrppp
B00543RC0Y|5.0|While many people complain there supposedly are no special features on these disks, there are loads of them. I have the UK Blu-Ray box set that has 11 discs in it instead of the 8 discs in the US version. All 8 movies have tremendous quality and Bonus Features. The only thing is that he cases are a bit flimsy and that may have a bit better if the cases were a bit stiffer, but otherwise a Fantastic product. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Harry Potter!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is great. Like angry birds but m more of a frontal approach. I give it two thumbs up.
B0068THAGY|5.0|The actors were great.  I enjoyed the special effects.  The plot was interesting and well paced.  I had an enjoyable evening watching it.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|I had a very difficult time getting all the way to the end of this game -- not because it was too challenging, but because it was just so slow! Playing this game makes me think that Anuman certainly knows how to make games (and boy do they crank out lots of cookie-cutter games just like this one), I don't think they understand why some hidden object games are so much fun.  Apparently, it takes more than just, \\"Hey, there's money in hidden object games, let's make hidden object games!\\"<br /><br />Although I have purchased a few of these games from Anuman (and dozens from other companies), I have yet to find one I would consider very good.  [[ASIN:B007W24NT8 XIII - Lost Identity]] is probably their best one.  Really, you'd probably be better off spending the same money on just about any hidden object title from one of the other major HO developers (G5, Big Fish, Alawar, etc.) and get a better game.<br /><br />The hidden object scenes are almost always far too easy, and the mini-games are seem pretty pointless (tap on an image when it appears, solve a 6-piece jigsaw puzzle, make 20 matches in a very basic, untimed match-3 game).  You really can't ever lose any of them.<br /><br />The Puzzles are mindless. You can almost always clearly see the solution, you just have to spend the time going through the steps to solve them. The ones that have the most potential are mechanically very buggy -- the sliding puzzles take more time struggling to actually move a piece in the direction you want them to go then figuring out where to slide them.  Nothing tops the frustration of swiping left to right on a playing card in the hedge maze 20-30 times because it refuses to slide anywhere but up and down.  I literally had Alice 2 spaces from the exit of the puzzle with nothing blocking her, but I could not get her to move to the right.<br /><br />Although they look like a lot of fun from the screenshots, I would steer clear of Anuman hidden object games in general, but definitely don'twaste your time or money on Alice in Wonderland.<br />-------<br />If you found this review helped you learn more about the game without having to buy it yourself, please hit \\"Yes\\".
B008SVS0K0|5.0|Billy Talent never disappoints. Wish I could say the same for the majority of the rock industry nowadays. Now System of a Down need to release a new album. Tool too.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My life in a nutshell - full time working mom of a 17 month old, 5'4\\" and about 135lbs (still trying to work off the last 10lbs of my pregnancy), up every morning at 4:45am and don't have a second to myself until 7pm when my son goes down to bed.  This DVD was the right length (20 minutes or so)  and I like that it has three different workouts.  I have been doing it for about 3 weeks now, missing maybe a day a week.  I have not seen a lot of weight loss, but I have noticed significant changes in my core and upper body as far as toning goes.  And I definitely feel stronger and have more endurance.  You can absolutely tell when you are trying to \\"phone it in\\" as Jillian says, you will only get out of this DVD what you put in.  And she is a good motivator.  I am definitely glad I bought this, and would recommend it to any friend of mine.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I got love this app. It keeps my passwords safe and let's me sync between my phone and tablet. I love it.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|This is great music!  I find it inspiring and love to listen to it over and over again. I'm looking forward to more of this type of music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! works better than going to the website on my fire. Definite must -have. Much better than expected.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is my second Gillian Flynn book.  I read Gone Girl first, and LOVED the writing, but hated the book (at least the ending).  I was so incredibly upset with Gone Girl's terrible finish, that I can't believe I didn't write Flynn off for life, but gave her one more shot since her actual writing was so absorbing.<br />Just like Gone Girl, the book was intriguing and unpredictable - I was so excited to get to the ending.<br />Flynn has a way to make you really start to love very unlovable women.  I liked that the female protagonist wasn't the normal cliché good girl character.  She has flaws.  A lot of them.  And as the story unfolds, you I was so drawn to Camille! Even with her imperfections and bad decisions.<br /><br />It is rare that I do much reading outside of my normal bedtime reading, but I was so fascinated by the story I made sure to find time throughout the day to get a few more pages in.<br /><br />And luckily, I enjoyed this ending far more than I enjoyed Gone Girl.  It still had an unexpected twist, and still ended without fireworks and pizazz, but it was very enjoyable, not predictable, and definitely not fairytale.<br />I will now give Flynn another shot in the future since her novels are so captivating!!<br />It's a quick read, and a dark story, but I highly recommend this one!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The app works great. Layout is easy to use. Love the way it displays the entered numbers/action shadowed below the answers so you can check for mistakes.  Adds up to one great app.
1401322786|5.0|Wow, this was not what I had expected.  I was expecting a typical time travel story (something like The Time Traveler's Wife) but what I got was a unique story that looks deeply into humanities understanding and handling of time.  This is a short novel yet Albom is able to take us through thousands of years (from early hunter-gatherer society to modern times).<br /><br />During the first half of the book, I thought, this is a nice story, an unusual story but by the end, I was thoroughly charmed by Albom's writing, his characters, and his ideas. Amazon lists The Time Keeper for the 18 and over crowd but I think this is a book that all teenagers should read.  Albom does an amazing job at touching on the pain and loneliness that is so often a part of growing up and the effects of cyber bullying.  Through events that are reminiscent of Dicken's A Christmas Carol, he shows us that we are never truly alone.<br /><br /> The Time Keeper is a quick but important read.  I recommend it to everyone. **I would like to thank Hyperion and netgalley.com for this wonderful eARC.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You have so much more than just a Bible at you disposal, This app allows you additional features like the vocal reading of scriptures i often use it as i travel to work to listen to the word. Daily reading plans are available, a whole community of fellow Christians are at your disposal through the community section if your Church is plugged into this app you can follow along with the lesson plan during service. The You version app. is a must have for the person on the go.......
B000W4D94I|5.0|I love this movie and I was even happier to find it on Blu Ray! It was in great condition as promised, along with really fast shipping!
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Outstanding, outstanding depiction of the personalities and dilemmas inside current-day investment banks.  Cast, script, and performances are just fantastic.  There is no nonsense, melodrama, or explosions to ruin it.  If you want to feel what it was like for many hotshots engaged in borderline behavior within investment banks in the 2000s, here it is.
1466401885|5.0|I was looking for a good love story after reading the 50 shades of grey installment several times and this book did the trick. It is targeted towards a younger crowd, but all the characters are easy to love and the plot is really good. I would highly recommend it.
B008HOR7VQ|5.0|Have had this on preorder since it was announced, and then heard the bad news that there is currently no plans for a US release due to corporate greed (not MK or amazon's fault, but wish amazon would inform their shoppers!)  Was lucky enough to be in Germany when it was released and was able to find a copy easily of the \\"deluxe\\" version. In a great booklet-type package with bonus 3rd CD with some new and old stuff.  I have been listening to MK and DS for about 30 years, and never get tired of any of it, but this is by far some of the best in a while...and since I consider most past releases outstanding, that is saying something.  The blues on this CD are to die for!!!  Lyrics and arrangements fantastic, as always - love the sense of place and storytelling in MKs songs.  And guitar is amazing as always.  Think MK been spending more time at the Crossroads than he has in the UK - just awesome.  Glad to hear a fresh new sound from him combining the blues with celtic, rock and traditional country.  Hope the contract dispute gets resolved soon so this is available in the US, but if not, do whatever you can to get a copy!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is one of those books that just sucked me in. The writing was easy, the characters came to life and the story was well written. I laughed, I cried, I loved, I swooned. I freaking loved this book to pieces and it slammed its way into my heart.<br /><br />The story of Slammed was written in such a way that I felt completely immersed. It was so realistically realistic. I felt like the characters could be anyone. Layken as a main character was highly likeable. It's the small things that really helped me attach to her, like when she pretends to be a zombie and chases her little brother around or the incident with the Darth Vader bedroom slippers. The relationship Layken has with her mother is, again, realistic. It's not perfect, but what relationship is? There is immediate chemistry between Layken and Will when they first meet; they're cute and awkward and I love them. And speaking of Will...I was in need of a new favorite bookish boy. Why can't he be real?? ARG. This book only helped cement my love of boys-next-door (or in this case boys across the street).<br /><br />2 of my favorite things about this book:<br /><br />#1 Poetry slams!! Before reading this book, my knowledge of poetry slams was what I've gathered from television. All I could think about was the episode of Boy Meets World when Cory gets up and slams TOPANGA! I imagined a dark room filled with people wearing berets drinking espresso and contemplating the universe. The poetry slams in this book RULE! And I want to go to one! It's not just about reading lines off a page; it's about performing something that lets people \\"see a glimpse into your soul\\". Who knew poetry slams could be so cool? I know I didn't. The poems that were presented during the slams were very touching, especially the one Will does at the end of the book. It definitely spoke to my soul.<br /><br />#2 I love books that include song lyrics. Whether they are given at the beginning of the chapter, as is done in Slammed, or at the end or just randomly scattered. Song lyrics can add a lot of depth and meaning to a story. As did all the Avett Brothers lyrics that were included in this book. I've never listened to this band, but they are poets in their own right and I will definitely be checking them out now.<br />Overall, this book was a slice of apple pie heaven that I want seconds of. Oh that's right, the second book is already out! Point of Retreat, we will be meeting very soon my friend!<br /><br />Bottom Line: To NOT read Slammed by Colleen Hoover..well that's NOT a good idea. :) 4.5/5or just randomly scattered.

B0070XFNDE|5.0|This novel ends where it starts--almost.  The main character, Fermin, is a man for all seasons plus some.  The tribulations he endures to uphold his own personal standards of behavior during the time of the Spanish Civil War are frightening and gory.<br /><br />The author has such a gift for creating an atmosphere of calm in the face of chaos, however, that even though the characters may be suffering, the reader isn't.  And Fermin is a very funny guy.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Excellent App.  Mixing the sounds is helpful when I want to create a sound that isn't on the App yet like lightning &amp; surf.
B00884GR0W|3.0|this game is waaay better than mc pocket edition but not way Betta then Pc version of mc so this is a good phone game just be more original
006198969X|5.0|For teenagers to 20's, this book is perfect. Lauren Conrad has a classy, chic style that I adore. The book ranges from organizing tips, hairstyles, to the staples in a wardrobe. She gives examples of many outfits, and whenever I see something I like, I look to the back of the book where is lists the designers for each page. I keep this book in my closet and refer to it almost every day, and I've read it cover to cover. I will definitely be purchasing her next book, Beauty.
B00846REIS|5.0|Left sad and wanting more after finishing the 50 Shades trilogy, a friend told me about this book.  I was very skeptical to start it because I didn't want to be disappointed.  I was not disappointed.  This book was great.  I can't wait until next month when the sequel comes out.
0525953728|5.0|I was riveted to this book.  I couldn't put it down till I read the whole thing.  If you want a real look into what went down with BL's end, this is the book for you.  Mark Owen is a true American hero and I don't see anything that rises to the level of compromising national security.  It's a travesty if that were to happen!
B000S57KVO|5.0|I love this movie and love this music.  I have wanted to buy the music since I first saw the movie years ago.  Happy to have finally purchased it!
B0087HT36U|5.0|I do not usually play games, but this one is addicting. Lots of levels! Toally deserve a chance to be played.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best SciFi books I've read in a long time. The story and the setting are different and interesting. The writing is crafted so you never quite know what is happening. Well, it's more like you never quite know what is about to happen or why. The flow gets you there and it works well in the near hindsight. So, it makes starting the first couple of chapters confusing; you don't know what's going on until you get past the first couple of chapters. You will get wrapped up in the story and where it might be going. It certainly makes you want the next one - and I just bought 6.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005I6EU48|5.0|It is awesome, no problems, good quality.<br />It is a really cool gift, and it looks really legit.<br /><br />Also works for Kindle Keyboard
B0090EIILU|5.0|I loved the Ali G Show and Borat was a good movie.  I absolutely hated Bruno and I turned it off after 10 minutes, the Dictator though was the best of his movies that I have seen so far.  I would be willing to watch it multiple times which is pretty rare due to how many movies come out each year.  I used to work in a movie store and I would easily recommend it to people that enjoy a good comedy and aren't easily offended.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie was full of action and suspense! It keeps your attention through out the movie ! I loved it
1451683405|5.0|Highly readable, eminently sensible and not without humor, the substance of Harris's little book when fully assimilated can lead to a state of mind which may well be poaching on the territory of Zen Buddhism.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been using this workout dvd for about 4 weeks now and people can already see a difference in me.  I alternate this dvd with Jillian Michaels No More Trouble Zones and I highly recommend them both, even for beginners :)
0440246016|1.0|I love the Jack Reacher series.  This particular book was so slow and so boring that I couldn't even finish it.  Normally I will finish a Jack Reacher book in 2-3 days.  After 2 weeks of trying to get through this one, I gave up.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|loaded up and provided better looking battery icon. I liked the predictive feature of how long the battery would last playing music.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is just like Mario. if you tried this when it first came out and hated It am with you, but this is now a amazing game. I think it would be worth $2.99
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was really really hot and bothersome. But the main character pisses me off at the end of the book, (no spoilers here) and I felt that it could have gone better. Overall the book does not take on a \\" over the course of several months\\" theme, but jumps right into her day by day life with Mr. Grey. Overall astounding.
0618680004|5.0|Hello. The condition of the book itself was great. Better than listed. And, content-wise, this is just mind blowing. This is a \\"must have\\" for all critical thinkers.

B0087HT36U|3.0|good game, but you cannot win several rounds due to a delay at beginning of levels. for example, on 2-28 it is impossible to explode a bomb before the cart makes contact, killing one of the chicks that you cannot afford to kill and still get the gold crown.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This would have been a 5 star review. But it totally flat lined for me at the end. I'm on book 3 now.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|My daughter turned me on to The Night Circus, and it was delightful and engrossing throughout, making my mouth water for another book from Ms. Morgenstern.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|it's okay, but when in areas with low cell service or no wifi then no bible.<br />like the devotions that are offered
B007B6T3K4|5.0|I had listened to Xandria before and quite frankly, wasn't very impressed. Then I heard a track from this new album and loved it! The new vocalist Manuela Kraller is a huge improvement over Lisa Schaphaus-Middelhauve, at least to my taste. She sounds very much like Tarja Turunen from the earlier Nightwish era. Which is a very good thing. Perhaps this will help fill the void left behind since she left Nightwish. Anyway, the instrumentals are also much better. The guitars are heavier, crunchier and less campy than before, the drumming is also much improved. This is a very well written, well executed and well sung album. This is real symphonic metal! I hope this line-up lasts for a while because it's working. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on Kraller, her voice is wonderful! If you love Epica and Tarja-era Nightwish, you'll like this.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I had already read this book borrowed from a library before I purchased my kindle edition, as knew I wanted to add it to my permanent library.  To me, it is one of the more playfully original stories in a genre of its own.  What an allegory of coming of age  that a child can be given life insights from another dimension of reality.  Although metaphysical/sci-fi in nature, this is a believeable story.  The photographs add to the impact of understanding these gifted children. On first impact, this book appeared creepy but reveals itself as a gem of reading entertainment.  A delightful blend of weird and wonderful!

B00007E8O5|5.0|After Boggy Depot, Alice in Chains briefly got back together to record a couple songs and release a compilation set, but once again fell apart right after: so Jerry stepped back up to the plate and made it on his own. This double album is the way Jerry wished it to be released from the start: the earlier single disc set was a compromise with the record company nervous about a project of this size. Now that we have the full package, Degradation Trip vol. 1&2 is different than his Debut, but is no less strong.<br /><br />Other reviews do the `song-by-song' approach so I'll just give my thoughts on the set and point out some of the standouts in my opinion. This set is less experimental than Boggy Depot, and focuses more on Cantrell's signature heavy, sludgy riffing balanced with some gorgeous acoustic numbers. The album is quite a bit heavier than Boggy Depot, with songs like \\"Spiderbite\\", \\"Hellbound\\", \\"Anger Rising\\" and \\"She Was My Girl\\" rivaling Soundgarden's Batmotorfinger in terms of raw, heavy, in your face metal. Though in true Cantrell style we get gorgeous acoustic songs like \\"Gone\\", \\"31/32\\" and \\"Give it a Name\\" to balance the experience, and songs like \\"Siddhartha\\", \\"Feel the Void\\" and \\"What it Takes\\" recall the creepy, skin crawling style of AiC hits like \\"Died\\" and \\"Get Born Again\\".<br /><br />Jerry mostly sings at a much lower pitch than he did on his previous solo effort, matching the darker, dirtier sound of the album, though he rises up on the acoustic numbers to keep those songs refreshing breaks from all the darkness. As far as other things, I do feel the greater prominence of the Bass over Boggy Depot is important since many of the songs are slow and sludgy, and nothing is as dank and sludgy as a well-played bass line.<br /><br />Overall Cantrell's second solo effort is a different sort of flavor from his debut, but it's still amazing and shows off how strong he is on his own. I honestly feel than Jerry Cantrell is just as strong on his own as he is with Alice in Chains, and I wish his solo efforts got greater recognition.

0452289963|3.0|A New Earth: Awakening to your life's purpose by Eckhart Tolle, Michael Joseph (Penguin), 2005, 330 ff.<br /><br />Tolle's earlier book, The Power of Now, was an introspective on how to mould the self into a spiritual being by abandoning the ego. This book, which takes its title from a biblical quotation, presents essentially the same material but is directed towards helping others achieve the same goal, primarily by example. His aim, he says, is to encourage others to a `transformation of consciousness' by abandoning the idea of ego and self.<br /><br />His second chapter on `Ego: The Current State of Humanity' is indeed an accurate reflection of the materialist individualism that has been prevalent in western society for the past few decades. Tolle is right when he says that too many people derive their sense of identity from material things; but he prefers Sartre's view of identity to the Cartesian \\"cogito\\", where identity and consciousness are bound up with thinking - Tolle has a problem with our being able to think, for thinking just happens and is not a voluntary action.<br /><br />The next two chapters continue this exploration of the nature of the ego until we move back to the \\"pain-body\\" that Tolle introduced in the earlier book. Like Hegel and Marx, he recognizes the destructive role of alienation, of otherness, which prevents us from feeling a sense of identity with other people and our environment. This sense of feeling hurt by others is what Tolle describes as the \\"pain-body\\" - `an accumulation of old emotional pain.' The aim in life is to overcome the negative emotions of the pain-body through \\"satori\\", a Zen term for the `arising of inner spaciousness', and there is a whole chapter on `The Discovery of Inner Space'.<br /><br />The book ends with a chapter on The New Earth as Tolle sees it. The theme of the book is one that has been explored by many authors, for example, Gill Edwards (Living Magically), Louise Hay (You Can Heal Your Life; unlike Tolle, Louise believes we can choose our thoughts), Philip Jacobs (One Self - note! No sense here that we have to abandon the idea of `self' for enlightenment) and, most eminently, The Dalai Lama (The Four Noble Truths). So, while the message here of 'living in the present' is laudable, the 300 pages seem almost interminable and The Power of Now, and several other authors, say essentially the same things much more succinctly.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]]<br />[[ASIN:0722535503 The Four Noble Truths]]Louise believes we can choose our thoughts), Philip Jacobs (One Self - note!

B008RV5K5E|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I read the original graphic novel series many years ago. I understand that such a work as done by Frank Miller could be difficult to translate into an animated film simply because of the nature in which it was written and the way in which the artwork was constructed. All in all, while I did feel some disappointment with this film, I did find it to be an entertaining re-telling of Frank Miller's original work. It seemed to hold the proper tone that Miller was trying to capture in that an aging Batman has to contend with a society that no longer wants his presence as well as his age handicapping his abilities.<br /><br />One thing that did bother me was the lack of \\"voice-over\\" narration by Batman as seen in the graphic novel. While the lack of this narration did not detract from the film and it's impact, I think there would have been an even stronger impact upon viewers if we could hear those intimate, calculating, emotional thoughts that Batman had during each encounter. A perfect example is when he first comes back onto the scene and is climbing a rope to reach the bad guys. One bad guy says that Batman has to be old by now. In response to this, the Batman voice-over says, \\"Old enough to need to use my legs to climb a rope\\". This occurs in the comics, not the film, but I think it really allows the audience a peek into the mindframe and mindset of Batman while he engages in his crime-fighting activities. As I said, it is not a mood-killer that it was left out of the film, but I do think the creative team behind the film kind of missed out on a very good opportunity to really suck the audience of the film into the mind of Batman.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the voice casting for Batman/Bruce Wayne. Yes, Peter Weller did a fine job with this, and I give him his due credit for giving life to an aging Batman. I also understand why the creative team might have wanted to not utilize the legendary Kevin Conroy (the one and only true voice for Batman from the animated series of the 90's, the Justice League animated series, the animated movie between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and the Arkham video games) for the voice in an effort to open up people's minds to the concept of more than one person being able to bring Batman to life. Unfortunately, I feel like the creative team missed the boat a bit on this one. For anyone who ever watched the animated series from the 90's, you may recall that they did a storytelling episode that actually made use of Frank Miller's graphic novel. In specific, they showed a scene that blended Batman's initial attack against the Mutants with his final fight against the Mutant's leader in which he utter's the infamous expression, \\"This isn't a trash heap, it's an operating table, and I'm the suregon.\\" In this instance, the creative team behind the animated series made, in my opinion, an absolutely genius decision to utilize Michael Ironside (\\"Jester\\" from the film Top Gun) as the voice of Batman. I really and truly wish the team behind the Dark Knight Returns movie had decided to retain his voice or, if they had indeed tried to go that route, that Mr. Ironside had accepted any offer to do said voice for this film. While Peter Weller certainly exemplified the cold and dark visage of Batman, Michael Ironside, in just a ten minute clip, truly seemed to epitomize the dark, gritty, dangerousness of a Batman who, while having grown older, has also become a lot more calculating and deadly with his experiences. It was a truly missed opportunity.<br /><br />Overall, I was generally happy with the film and look forward to seeing how they put the rest of Miller's story into film in part 2, particularly the verbal back and forth and eventual combat between Batman and Superman.
1577314808|4.0|The Power of Now: A guide to spiritual enlightenment, by Eckhart Tolle, New World Library, USA, 1999; Hodder and Stoughton, UK, 2001; 224 ff.<br /><br />Tolle has grown up from an unhappy, potentially suicidal childhood to write an inspiring text on the search for peace and contentment through spiritual enlightenment. Born Ulrich Tolle in Germany he changed his name from his admiration for the writings of the German mystic, Meister Eckhart. Self taught from the age of 13 he nevertheless graduated from both the University of London and Cambridge University. This book is essentially an approachable and non-religious distillation of the core teachings of Buddhism.<br /><br />The book is written as a dialogue between the author and an imaginary sceptical inquisitor. The quest is a search for release from the pain-body as Eckhart calls it, which has elements of Jung's shadow about it but is probably closest to the Buddhist notion of \\"dukkha\\" - unease, discontent or disquiet, the continual search for something more and better. Eckhart is encouraging us to `leave mind and find consciousness', to set aside `the delusion of time' for `nothing exists outside the now'. Or, as a wise mystic told me, `The past is gone - it cannot be changed or rewritten. The future is only a series of wishes and dreams - or fears, of consequences of past misdeeds. The present is the only place to be.'  To quote Eckhart again: `The power of Now is your consciousness liberated from thought forms'. It is about `Finding your invisible and indestructible reality' in order to slow down the aging process, strengthen the immune system and encourage enlightened relationships. The setting aside of the ego is something many spiritual disciplines encourage.<br /><br />Whether you are already on a spiritual quest or are seeking the key to open one, this is a worthwhile read. My only serious criticism would be that it is rather repetitive. The essential message could have been presented in just a few pages: but then, a message that is so alien to the kind of life that most of us lead needs to be repeated in many different ways.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0722535503 The Four Noble Truths]]ut then, a message that is so alien to the kind of life that most of us lead needs to be repeated in many different ways.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0722535503 The Four Noble Truths]]
B0084IG7KC|1.0|Definitely not my cup of tea.. What a wasted purchase, and a waste of time watching it. Hope there is no sequel.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|A decent flick but far less in both content and excitement than the book.  Worth a look but I'll not buy the next episode until I've rented it for a first look.
0143119680|4.0|This is a huge novel! According to amazon.com it's 592 pages but it seems a bit longer. This is the first of a trilogy of books and the debut novel of author Deborah Harkness.<br />I had heard a lot about this book while I was at the 2012 Comic Con. It was toted as an adult version of Twilight meets Harry Potter (interesting, yes?) but before I embarked on it, I wanted to read some reviews and boy do they vary. Usually when I read reviews, you can get a good idea usually that people either love it or hate it. Sometimes 9 times out of 10 people will love a book (street team aside) and you'll have a few that will hate it for one reason or another. The flip side can be people hate it except for a few. Anywho, If I'm unsure about a book, I do look at the reviews to get a good idea what I'm in for. This book however, is one of the first that I've run into where you can't make heads or tails of it from the reviews. People either absolutely love it or the absolutely loathe it for again, one reason or another and it seems to be split right down the middle. So to add to all the confusion, here's my review:<br />I WAS ABSOLUTELY BORED OUT OF MY MIND......In the beginning. Now I never try to give you spoilers or take you step by step through a book because I don't want to spoil things for you. I'll give you the blurb and the link but usually that's it, then I give my review. In this case, I'll walk you through a bit because the book is so long and I can't possibly not explain parts of it. With that being said, the books starts out with Diana (main character) coming across a book. She then reads parts of the book then puts it back. Oh and by the way,she's a witch with untold power but she refuses to acknowledge her power or use it in any way. She tries to fit in among us lowly humans and becomes a scholar. She's doing research and comes across the enchanted book. Supposedly the book releases a large amount of power upon being found. The power draws other \\"creatures\\" to Diana and the book even though she's put the book back and now it's been lost once again, shocking! One of the main creatures to find her is a vampire named Matthew who becomes the other main character. Diana and Matthew eventually fall in love but you're never quiet sure what Matthew is up to. He's a very complicated character but you almost get the feeling that he's almost too complicated. He has tons of secrets (who wouldn't after thousands of years). When we meet him in the beginning we know he's after the book and also a fellow scholar but as the book goes on, we find out that's only the surface.<br />The first book \\"Discovery Of Witches\\" is basically romance and world building for the trilogy. It's showing the relationship between Diana and Matthew as well as what the following two books in the trilogy will entail. Unfortunately the author seems to think that you need to follow the characters through every single movement of the day. By the time you finish the book, you feel like you were with the characters every step of the day. And the whole book really takes place only over a few weeks. Now with that being said, if you realize what the author is doing and let yourself be totally immersed in this world, it can be quite interesting but if you have no patience for this type of writing and want the whole story wrapped up as quickly as possible, this is not the book for you. I, like you, like a quick tale but this is not it. The author wants you sucked into the world, to identify with either of the two main characters and probably become one. She shares feelings, textures, scents, sounds, emotions, etc. When I say the author goes over every detail, I am not kidding. The story really probably could have been told in 200+ pages with a good editor but it's close to 600 pages and most of that is fill or fluff. Oh and as a word to the wise or to my romance fans, there is no sex scenes in this book. Matthew is totally \\"old fashion\\" in every sense of the word. Even after theydeclare their love for each other and Diana basically throws herself at him, he turns her down to where you think he might even be gay. With that being said, you do however eventually come to see why he's so scared about that level of intimacy. What this book boils down to is almost a classic forbidden romance because of race, yep you heard me, race. In Harkness's world, vampires, witches, demons and humans are the four races that inhabit the world and there is no way they should ever, ever mix. They totally loathe each other and the latter of the 4 do everything in their power to keep the lowly humans from finding out the others exist which includes not mingling with each other and never ever do they have relations but Diana and Matthew will not deny their love. So you can see where this is going......Diana and Matthew do the classic Romeo and Juliet thing and defy all others with a forbidden love. This book takes on politics, romance, paranormal, history, race relations, family and so on. It is so far a classic rebellion story....Viva La France!......oh whoops wrong story.<br />So what's my verdict on this book, well.....if you like forbidden romance, history, immersing yourself in a world totally, world building and are prepared to be in it for the long haul, I think you'll like the books. Remember, the first half of this book is supper slow and pretty much you're in Diana's head although you do meet Matthew early on. Just remember a few key things while reading it, the book (Ashmole) is important. So her early encounter of it, keep in the back of your mind. Characters are important but there's so many it's hard to keep them all straight but as you meet them, remember what you can. And the history and lore are important, so as they spout it out, keep it in the back of your mind as well. Other then that, have fun with it and remember you must have patience for these books.<br />Oh and just as an FYI - There is a movie in the works for this trilogy. Here's the blurb from the authors website: Warner Brothers Pictures has secured the film rights to the All Souls Trilogy. Work is currently underway to adapt the first book, A Discovery of Witches, for the screen. Denise DiNovi and Alison Greenspan are producing the film. Playwright David Auburn, who has received both a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award, has been hired to write the screenplay.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it is a great site.  many different ideas for all different catagories.  its easy to find something new to do. crafts baking, cooking, etc.
B00962ZOOA|4.0|I must admit that although I'm a huge Melanie C fan (actually discovered her AFTER the Spice Girls), I'm not a show tune fan. AT ALL. That said, I really. really, really, really, really, really, really love this CD. Most of the songs aren't so theatrical, they just sound like pop songs. My favorite is \\"Tell Me It's Not True,\\" apparently from the show Blood Brothers, but it passes for a radio hit. And it's not all musical theater stuff: snappy updated versions of standards like \\"Both Sides Now\\" and \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do WIth Myself\\" are really good.<br /><br />She's just got a great unconventional pop voice and she's not studio enhanced or autotuned to make her sound better (proof = check out the video for her acoustic rendition of \\"Think About It\\"). She has talent, and I recommend this even if you have reservations about a Broadway cover disc.
B007SGM084|5.0|The explicit sex and self described kinky sex was expected after reviews of this series.  But I found the sex just part of the story.  The main story was one of love and evolving exporations of the characters.  Unfortunately in this age of extensive drug use, Christian's experiences as a young child are not unique.  So sad, yes, for him and all children abused.  I can relate to Ana's innoncence and what she did for the man she loved.  All in all, a great love story.  I loved the chapter at the end of the third book that described their first meeting from Christian's point of view.  Maybe there should have been two series - one from each point of view.

0670020478|4.0|Ken Robinson provides some interesting insight as to why many people never find their true \\"calling\\". The outdated manner in which our system of education is run only adds to the problem. This book goes a long way into describing how people find their passion or \\"element\\" and why it is so important to do so. I would have liked if he had offered more real and practical solutions as to how we can change schools- maybe that's another book.

B008B0QH5S|4.0|I've always loved their BEHAVIOR CD, moody & chilly and this one, ELYSIUM comes pretty close to achieving that something special that people all over the world will relate to. These guys have been around since the 80's and continue to inspire with their latest. There is a couple experiements thrown into these sessions(more like something you'd hear from one of their b sides) but its an amazing collection none the less, riding down the highway with these tunes, it some of their best stuff in years and years and its like closing your eyes and going back in time, but the production is even better. Many love songs but so the music is so damn moody and catchy.  There is always a bit of clever British humor to there style which I have always enjoyed. I like the first single \\"Winner\\" on the remix 8 mins long over the radio single, it has much more electronics and mood. \\"Leaving\\", the second single is sure to bring back the older fans, as well as songs \\"Memory of the future\\", \\"A face like that\\", \\"your early stuff\\", and \\"Requiem in denim and leoparskin\\", this one's a proper comeback to those that loved their late 80's, early 90's period.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is great  I love it  but after a while it doesnt work at all  it sucks poo a lot
0312576463|2.0|In my book, in any book, a happy ending makes up for a lot, but this one doesn't do it. What a great writer Franzen is, and how cleverly he imagines situations for his characters to experience; however!, in Freedom Franzen has gone to great lengths to create a terrible emotional torture chamber into which he deposits Walter and Patty and Joey, in particular, to suffer for page after excruciating page. I looked forward with relief to the sections on Richard, because Richard, at least, was too busy living his life to suffer. If you're not a masochist yourself, give this one a pass.

B006MHWXMS|4.0|Excellent app for keeping track of all the things that enroll up on my 'Don't forget to...' list. The separate colors for tasks without deadlines, those with them (and those past deadline!), as well as for those already completed, make it particularly useful.

B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesomely addicting! The puzzles are fun to figure out. You need to figure out ways to use water in various forms ( liquid, ice, steam) to help perry the platypus continue through his tube to his underground Headquarters. Great way to kill time.Highly recommended.

B008MM9630|5.0|I love playing this game on facebook. So I'm very pleased to see it in an application that I can use on my Kindle Fire. The graphics and gameplay are easy and fun. And I love the creativity.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I agree with all his pro's list but I want to comment on his con's.<br />I'm on level 22 of the third area which totals 148 total levels I've completed. I have yet to need a paid bomb to complete a level with a gold crown - angry bird equivalent of 3 stars. You only need them if you're lazy.<br />The other thing is his comment about lag after you complete a level - like angry birds, it waits for the dust to settle before totalling your points. That's all.<br /><br />I find this game better in that aiming is easier, especially on the smaller screen of my razr M, the zoom feature is very helpful.
B006N57PXG|5.0|I found this book to be absolutely intoxicating! Jonathan Stroud is amazing in his ability to pull the reader in from the very first page. The story line about an ancient djin being brought into forced service by an inexperienced child magician, and told from the djin's perspective is hilarious. The pages fly by as you get to know both characters more intimately and drawn into both sides equally. It is well written with a clean, youth friendly read, (refreshing, to say the least). I absolutely recommend this book, and challenge you, to not be compelled to follow up with books #2 and #3...
B006AZZPCM|1.0|it use to work for me, really well too but now it wont even let me watch the video let alone download it.<br /><br />I hate it now.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|This movie is not only about baseball but also about family & dreams. It was great to watch with the whole family.
1582701709|5.0|I must say that the box came in such aura, that is just unexplainable and different. So I started reading... didn't know what to expect... As this maybe just another self development book that I read.<br /><br />A BIG NO! It is so deep, so intense and I feel so connected to every story and every page, as if every sentence was dedicated to me. The book was talking to me, guiding my heart, feeling and mind. I treasure every second reading it, and now I get copies for my loved ones, with prayers that it will bring lights to what so ever answers they are looking for. PEOPLE, I tried and experience the suggestion suggested, and best part the LIGHT that it brought to my personal life is just UNBELIEVABLE! MIRACLES happened one after another... I'm living a totally NEW light of life now... and INTEND TO KEEP IT THAT WAY! The way how I've always wanted it to be...<br /><br />Thanks Rhonda, see you soon. ^_^
B008XG1X18|4.0|seems to crash a lot otherwise I'd give it a 5. only other thing that bothers me are all these women pinning exercises they'll never do
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy it very much. It makes me use my brain on a regular basis and it is relaxing for me. I have always enjoyed matching games. Every once in a while though it does get stuck. Everything freezes up, but if I back out and re-enter it is fine. I love the game!!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This movie was totally funny!<br /><br />I'm a big-time fan of the original BHChichuahua, but I found part 2 lacking and forgettable. Part 3 is way better, almost as good as the original in terms of laughs, thanks in large part to newcomer scriptwriter Dana Starfield. There were certain music scenes that had me literally rolling on the floor with laughter, and a certain happy ending that appears halfway through the closing credits that had me in tears.<br /><br />I feel like a lot of effort was put into this sequal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the original.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Always made you want to keep reading.  I instantly downloaded another Flynn book because I enjoyed the twisted plot of Gone Girl.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|Let me start off by saying I LOVE MOVIES.Even some of the worst films turn out to be the best for me.Unfortunately, in this case, the same doesn' hold true. I wanted to see if this was a worth buying in 3-D so I viewed it in the 2-D format. The opening of the movie was wonderful. During the air battle ,I remember thinking \\"Wow ,it looks like I am in for a great time\\". Then as the movie progressed , it just seemed to be lacking something( for me). There was a time when it started to pick up and I said \\"ok here we go\\" and then about 10 minutes later ,things went sour. Was it terrible? no, was it fun in some parts?yes but just not enough . It just wasn't what I was hopeing for and I really wanted to like it so I could buy it in 3-D<br /><br />One thing I must say ,it had a happy ending, I was happy it ended
B007IXWKUK|1.0|All I can say is I wasted almost 30.00 on this trilogy set.  A waste of mt time.  I kept reading, thinking it would get better!  Boy was I wrong!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book was very informative.  It is a bit heavier on the \\"Why we Get Fat\\" section and less on \\"What to do About it\\".  However, I would recommend it to learn about the history of food, nutrition, and the long/short term effects of the food that we eat.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I feel I wasted my money on this  trilogy!  I can not for the world, understand what all the  hype is about concerning this series.  It is poorly written and just soft porn.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After you finish one you have to go right to the next!  Very Entertaining!  A real page turner!!  No boring parts!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Confused as to what all the talk is about.  I did not enjoy book at all.  Nothing but soft porn!
B005LAIH5O|4.0|I hated Clash of the Titans, it was a dead fish to me, and the Zeus scenes had more weight to them than anything starring the non-charismatic hero. This film addresses a lot of those problems, trims the fat off while maintaining something for the humans to fight for (sons) and limits the bad stuff enough to be entertaining throughout. The star though is the outstanding CG, which I think owes more than a little bit to the God of War cutscenes that came before it. Another smart move was giving Worthington's Perseus character help in the form of better comic relief, which reduces the amount of straining he has to do to show warmth to the audience.<br /><br />I thought it would be bad but this will probably end up as one of the more rewatchable blu-rays in my collection.
B007SGM084|1.0|Wish I had read more reviews before I wasted my money on a poorly written series as this!  Wish I could get my money back since it was so bad, I could not make myself finish the trilogy!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game! Hard to put it down. This is the BEST game I have for Kindle Fire yet ;)
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Always loved Lee and couldn't wait for his next although his early novels were his better ones .. this one hit the bottom!. Wish I'd seen the reviews before I purchased this .. It started off with some hope, then staggered, then fell and couldn't get up. At somewhere past halfway, it lost it's way and seemed to just drift up and down a dreary interstate highway with no purpose. I wanted it to end but it just wouldn't ..It was also a rediculous and unbelievable storyline ..
0385742886|5.0|So we finally arrived to the last installment of Maze Runner Series. Well according to James Dashner's statements at least. But don't rejoice yet Maze Runner fans this book is just a prequel of the original trilogy so yes we will not see Teresa or Thomas so much here. To be exact you can only see them in the prologue part which is kinda sad since when I heard about this prequel I was excited to know how they got to be a part of WICKED but no James Dashner decided to ditch these characters and entirely go with new ones. So now we get Mark and Trina. Two teenagers who survived the Solar Flares and in this book we have get to know their story.<br /><br />What I like about this book is that it can be just a stand alone book (minus the prologue chapter) It has a fairly established storyline. Although the grand adventure we got from the original trilogy is not the case in this book. I feel the adventure was very limited this time to a confined place(well that is the point or situation anyway) So for me my impression is that we get a minimized version adventure.<br /><br />Second thing I liked was the logic between the backstory. Never really thought about the rationalizations told by the author until I read them and me.. I am totally sold on the ideas. It makes perfect sense. Its a proof that this book was researched and some big thoughts are put into it.<br /><br />And last thing, which is what I like about the Maze Runner series is that the endings are superb. There are something special about Dashner's ending that affects you in an intellectual and emotional way and this book is no exception. The ending was just great and it makes sense why he chose that ending.<br /><br />All in all if this is really the last book of the series, Dashner did a very good job closing this story and the characters. From Maze Runner , Scorch Trials, and Death Cure and this Kill Order, it deserves the high ranking it is getting on the charts.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I am not really that big a baseball fan. At most I will check the standings every day when the Orioles are playing well (like they are this season). I had heard of this book a couple of years back. I had heard the term 'sabremetrics' and I knew there was a revolution underway in baseball about how to evaluate talent and value players but that was about it.<br /><br />What prompted me to read the book, of course, was the movie. The movie, enjoyable as it was, made me think there was a better, more interesting story about this movement to revalue players. I have no idea why I didn't go out and grab the book before seeing the movie like I usually do. Perhaps I wasn't expecting to enjoy the movie as much as I did or to suspect there was a more interesting story underneath the movie.<br /><br />The movie focuses on one season (2002) after the A's have had three of their top stars raided by richer ball clubs, and how they set about to replace those players and go on to win even more games than the previous season. The story of how Billy Beane finds a new assistant GM who understands how to properly value players is told against the backdrop of Billy's own mis-valuation by the New York Mets and his failed career as a player.<br /><br />'Moneyball', the book, takes a much broader view of this than movie. It retains the story of Billy's failed career which explains why Billy knows that scouts don't know what they are talking about. (They talk in cliches, like a guy having a 'good face', as if this explains anything about how he hits, throws or fields.)<br /><br />The book also spends much more time on Bill James. Bill James gets a few brief mentions in the movie. In the book he gets an entire chapter. James was a night watchman in a Van Camp's pork and beans factory who almost single-handedly revolutionized how baseball compiled and analyzed statistics. It was Bill James, and his annual baseball abstracts, who proclaimed that the most important statistic in hitting was on-base percentage.<br /><br />Early in his front office career, Billy is exposed to James' ideas and they influence him profoundly. As a can't-miss, first round pick, sure-fire superstar who was a bust, he knows that the 'old baseball' men don't know what they are talking about. He suspects James is on to something and when he becomes GM of the A's he sets about implementing James' ideas.<br /><br />The A's haven't won the World Series since 1989 but James' ideas have been vindicated by the fact that the A's, one of the teams with the lowest payrolls, consistently outperforms many teams with much, much higher payrolls.<br /><br />Lewis' writing is easy to read, easy to understand and funny. He really tears down what he calls 'old baseball' in an entertaining way. Even if you don't much care for baseball, Lewis has something say about the use of objective data and efficient markets, in general.se percentage.<br /><br />Early in his front office career, Billy is exposed to James' ideas and they influence him profoundly.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A bit drag on and not as enticing story line when compare to the first two books! Should just borrow it from the library instead of paying for it!!
0375507256|1.0|I don't much go in for literary novels. However, every once in a while I will read one (Michael Chabon's 'The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay' or China Mieville's 'Perdido Street Station', for example) that makes me think I might be missing something.<br /><br />This is a highly celebrated novel as both a literary novel (nominated for the Man Booker Prize) and science fiction novel (nominated for the Clarke and Nebula Awards).<br /><br />I will just come right out and say it: I don't get it.<br /><br />Let me qualify that statement some. I get that the book has a complex style. There are six very loosely-related novellas, told in overlapping sections. But in order for this complexity to have a greater meaning or depth, the novellas must have something more in common. Unless I missed something, the only relation between the various protagonists is that they all have a comet-shaped birthmark between their shoulder and their collarbone. That's it. As Dave Barry says, I am not making this up. I wish I could find a deeper thread to the narratives and then I wouldn't feel like I had wasted the last five or six days reading it, but I can't. So I did.<br /><br />Mitchell is successful at giving each protagonist a distinct voice, but he resorts to some cheap tricks to do so. In the novella of Somni~451 he takes every word that begins with 'ex' and truncates that to just 'x'. Pretty weak stuff for a Man Booker Prize nominee. In Zachry's story he uses a un-educated patois reminiscent of Anthony Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange'. Yes, it gives the novella's narrator a unique voice. The problem is that, like all the other narrators in 'Cloud Atlas', he doesn't really have anything interesting to say.<br /><br />First off you have a young American attorney, Adam Ewing, crossing the Pacific from Australia who rescues an escaped slave. This story is told by means of a diary Ewing keeps which is read by... Robert Frobisher, a cad, conman and composer who is trying to steal music and heirlooms from a syphillitic dying composer (not to mention the composer's wife and daughter) in 1930s Belgium. This novella is told through a series of letters to one Rufus Sixtsmith. Sixtsmith becomes a whistle-blower to... Luisa Rey an aspiring investigative reporter who exposes an unsafe nuclear reactor in late 1970s California. Next we hear the story ('Ordeal', rather) of Timothy Cavendish, a British publisher in contemporary times. Then we jump to Somni~451, a condemned clone-slave (fabricant) who achieves a higher consciousness and becomes a catalyst for a revolution. Finally we hear a story of Zachry, a tribesman in post-Apocalyptic Hawaii who is visited by Meronym a member of the last technologically advanced civilization.<br /><br />The stories are told thusly:<br /><br />1a Adam Ewing<br />2a Roberth Frobisher<br />3a Luisa Rey<br />4a Timothy Cavendish<br />5a Somn_451<br />6 Zachry<br />5b Somni~451<br />4b Timothy Cavendish<br />3b Luisa Rey<br />2b Robert Frobisher<br />1b Adam Ewing<br /><br />Throughout each novella are links to other novellas (with the exception of Zachry's story which is self-contained and is not interrupted). The problem is these are meaningless flourishes. Apparently at some point Timothy Cavendish's story (along with Zachry's tale almost completely pointless) is made into a film which Somni~451 watches the first half of. Great. So what? I am sure when Mitchell outlined the structure of the - an aside: it's not really a novel; it's a collection of novellas - book that must have really looked great to the editor and publisher but without substantive links, it's a gimmick nothing more.<br /><br />I will say that of the six novellas, I enjoyed Somni~451's the most. Somni is a slave working in a future Korean fast-food restaurant. Her existence revolves utterly around the franchise for which she works (Papa Song's) and serving her customers. Fabricants (as they are known) are not supposed to have aspirations and are supposed tobe barely capable of higher thought. However, she is unwittingly subjected to an experiment that causes her ascension (development of a higher consciousness) and she is then removed from the fast-food franchise and thrust into the middle of a burgeoning civil war.<br /><br />Now, I say interesting but that is only in relation to the other novellas. In the Somni~451 novella we are shown a world of cruel corporatism and soul-less consumerism run amok. In fact, in the future, monetary transactions are conducted via the Soul, a subcutaneous chip implanted in purebloods ('real' people as opposed to fabricants).<br /><br />In Somni's future, brand names have been co-opted as nouns. Similar to aspirin now being a common noun and not a brand, in the future a gun is a colt, a computer is a sony and a cigarette is a marlboro. As social criticism it's about as subtle and deep as an Occupy Schenectady rally. And like the entire Occupy movement (and I use that term loosely) it's long on criticism but very, very, very short on solutions.<br /><br />In fact, Mitchell himself as much as admits he doesn't have one because the next novella in the sequence, Zachry's story, takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting.<br /><br />I picked up this book because I had heard from a friend that this movie got rave reviews at the Toronto International Film Festival. Well, it must have some pretty stunning visuals to have garnered such a reaction because it sure as heck isn't the story..be barely capable of higher thought.

B008BDZOZY|5.0|David Byrne has always been an important musical thinker as far as I'm concerned anyway. Always very strongly attuned to rhythms he was one of the few people of his era able to see the possibilities in the African concept of polyrhythms in music and finding new ways to expand on that. He not only did that as a founding member of Talking Heads but also through a couple decades of creatively groundbreaking solo recordings. Now there are a number of artists taking up his league such as Annie Clarke,better known as St.Vincent,who is in her way seeking to expand on the perceived foundations of \\"pop\\" music. So the two combined in 2010 to begin recording this project that would not only combine her songwriting with his rhythmic sensibilities,but also add to that an enormous brass section arranged by people like Lenny Pickett but also electronic beats from John Congleton. With all these cooks in the kitchen,would it be possible for the duo's talents to be able to express their musical points coherently. The results are more surprising than one might think.<br /><br />  One can dress it up any way they want,but the foundation of the music is here is still very much on funk. You can here that on songs such as the opening songs \\"Who\\",\\"Weekend In The Dust\\",\\"Dinner For Two\\",\\"Ice Age\\" and \\"I Am An Ape\\". Not only are Byrne and Clarke's musical outlooks both highly compatible but on these five numbers the groove is laid on thick for some uniquely produced funk/pop epics. \\"The Forest Awakes\\" and \\"I Should Watch TV\\" showcase a more prominant Afro-latin rhythm. Nothing new for Byrne of course but the mixture of them with some of the orchestral horn arrangements and creative use of melody again creates a potent groove based set up. On the former song,in fact the influence of the Minneapolis/Prince style use of the drum machine,prominent in hip-hop in years to come,is firmly in play. The only real full on orchestral/progressive pop song on here is \\"Optimist\\" with Clarke on lead vocals. Towards the end of the album Byrne takes over heavy on the chunky,soulful groove of \\"Lightening\\" and the afro funk explosion of \\"The One Who Broke Your Heart\\" with the Dap Kings and the like minded afropop band Antibalas. The album ends with the slower,epic groove of \\"Outside Of Space And Time\\" with the swelling and romantic lyrical imagery suiting the music to a tee.<br /><br />  For many people who've considered the innovation of funk in dance music during the 70's as a passing fad usually indelibly linked with the still sometimes controversial disco era,Byrne has consistently proved critics and musical scholars wrong on that regard with his creative way with funk rhythms and his promotion of the original talents who produced them. Funny thing is,only on rare occasions has this ever attracted a wide audience. And for that mostly earlier on in his career. Since he left Talking Heads in the late 1980's,most innovations in pop music have been based in some variation on the dour end of the alternative rock scene. The funk end of it only seemed to crop up occasionally and even then pushed far into the backround with other things. Even if his solo work was hit or miss affairs commercially,he stuck to his guns that the 70's funk/soul era provided the pop world with an excellent base for expansion in it's future. By blending that aesthetic with the musical and songwriting talents of St. Vincent he was again able to fashion yet another successful hybrid from this. An excellent instrumental and melodic epic that should be enough for even the most jaded musical cynic to realize,in terms of music,it hasn't \\"all been done\\".Towards the end of the album Byrne takes over heavy on the chunky,soulful groove of \\"Lightening\\" and the afro funk explosion of \\"The One Who Broke Your Heart\\" with the Dap Kings and the like minded afropop band Antibalas.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I keep having to remind myself that I am not the target audeince for these books. I suppose it's an excuse of sorts. Still I can't help but think that Ms. Collins took the easy way out by some of her choices.<br /><br />By choosing to write in the Young Adult genre, she ensures that her audience likely won't have much of a body of work to compare her books to. This is beneficial for her, otherwise her readers might recognize that her work is highly derivative of works like Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery' and William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' and even Stephen King's 'The Running Man' (writing as Richard Bachman).<br /><br />Her choice to confine the reader to the first person perspective of Katniss may help her readers identify with the protagonist, but it also severely limits the amount of world building she can do. All through this trilogy I wanted to know more about Panem. We get a brief history of the civil war that led to the Capitol's dominance which is just a device to explain how the Hunger Games started. We don't get much of a glimpse of life in the other districts. There's not even a good explanation of the geography of Panem. We don't know how big it is, where the individual districts are located, how far each one is from the Capitol, or what the climate is like. Almost nothing.<br /><br />Lastly, and there's no delicate way to put this, Katniss is annoying. Collins somehow manages the feat of making her completely self-absorbed and almost equally un-self-aware. This is where it would have helped Ms. Collins to have some other viewpoint characters.<br /><br />Some minor complaints:<br /><br />In book two, 'Catching Fire', Collins goes back to the well and - wait for it - puts Katniss back in the arena with Peeta. When I saw this was her intent, I couldn't believe it. I thought for sure Collins would come up with some device to avoid having to trod over this same ground again. But, no, there we are. The Quarter Quell aka Hunger Games Redux!<br /><br />Too much time is wasted in the beginning of the third book spent convincing Katniss to 'become the Mockingjay'. I suppose the idea of the leaders of the revolution being media savvy and essentially branding and marketing the revolt is mildly interesting. (Again, we are limited to Katniss' understanding of it.) Still the idea that anyone other than Katniss could be the Mockingjay is pretty dumb. Katniss was the one who defied the Capitol in the first Hunger Games by coming up with the idea of her and Peeta threatening to kill themselves. She was the one who popularized the mockingjay symbol by adopting it as her totem. She is the only recognizable figure symbolizing defiance through all the districts. Who else are they going to get? And yet there is much mental handwringing on Katniss' part over whether or not she will 'become the Mockingjay'.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed is that in true American neo-Puritan fashion there is a shocking amount of violence but no sex. Katniss and Peeta and Katniss and Gale do plenty of kissing but that's it. Yet there is no shortage of blood, including many children being killed. Surely in this world, the lifespans in the districts must be shortened by captivity, forced labor and near starvation conditions. That being the case I would expect children to mature to adulthood faster, with marriage and child-bearing coming earlier. There is no hint of this.<br /><br />Again, I will remind myself: I am not the target audience. Yet I can't help thinking what a nice dystopian sci-fi trilogy Ms. Collins might have had, had she been willing to expand her perspective a little bit and work a little more on the world building.oo much time is wasted in the beginning of the third book spent convincing Katniss to 'become the Mockingjay'.

B003QP4NPE|3.0|There is a burgeoning segment of the science fiction genre that deals with gaming, augmented reality, social networking. Books in this genre that I have read recently include 'Reamde' by Neal Stephenson, 'Rule 34' by Charles Stross, and 'This Is Not A Game' by Walter Jon Williams.<br /><br />'Daemon' is a worthy addition to this genre. According to the dust jacket Suarez is an enterprise IT consultant to Fortune 1000 companies. As an IT professional myself, I can say that Mr. Suarez seems to know his stuff. I couldn't find any obvious mistakes.<br /><br />The 'Daemon' referred to in the title isn't a denizen of hell or another plane. Rather it's a piece of software that executes once certain conditions are met. I don't like to give too much away so I will say that the Daemon is a very complex piece of software that, once set in motion, threatens to upend the economic and political and social order. So, obviously the stakes are high.<br /><br />Suarez does have several instances where characters lecture us about the problems in modern society but it's nothing too original (haves and have not, evil corporations, fat cats). And while the Daemon is threatening this order, it's less clear what the Daemon's author imagines will replace it. I am hoping this will be revealed in subsequent books.<br /><br />The reader follows a group of about six to eight throughout the novel with a shifting perspective. I didn't really feel like we got to know any of the characters very well. That being said, the reader isn't going to be reading a book like this for the depth or complexity of the character portraits. Rather the reader will be reading it for Suarez' command of the technology and how he imagines it being put to use.<br /><br />Mostly his imaginings are a good combination of thought-provoking and all-to-real. He does go a bit off the rails towards the end (robot motorcycles with swords - and, no, I am not making that up).<br /><br />One thing about 'Daemon' is that it does leave you hanging at the end of the book so if you want to know what happens, my guess is that you probably will have no choice but to read books two and three of the trilogy. Luckily I was entertained enough that I will be reading the second book (at least).ve you hanging at the end of the book so if you want to know what happens, my guess is that you probably will have no choice but to read books two and three of the trilogy.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|My wife and I watched this having no idea what to expect. I had not read any reviews and selected this one on a hunch while looking for something I thought would please my wife.<br /><br />It did not take long for both of us to become at first interested, then fascinated and delighted with the movie; as my wife said, it avoided the usual clich&eacute;s. Woody Allen does a marvelous job of presenting a romantic Paris to the viewer in the time allowed. The story is a fantasy romance that shows Paris at its best and introduces an unexpected plot twist that caught us both by surprise.<br /><br />No effort is made to explain the major fantasy component but no explanation is wanted or needed as the viewer enjoys a fanciful adventure that can only happen in Paris at midnight.<br /><br />The movie is a charming diversion and provides a very pleasant evening's entertainment for the entire family.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|The Jack Reacher series by Lee Child has always been my all time favorite series. I tell everyone who reads and asks that I love me some Jack!  I've read every book and feel like I know Jack (on his good side I hope *yikes*). It takes a pretty awesome fiction character to have his own detailed wiki page!<br /><br />Jack Reacher:<br /><br />Height - 6'5\\"<br />Chest - 50 inches<br />Weight - 210-250 lbs<br /><br />Jack has ice blue eyes, dirty blond hair, very little body fat. He is incredibly strong with a savant like intelligence, military training and a remarkable ability to analyze his environment and opponents at high processing speeds.<br /><br />The love I have for this series will probably make you understand that hearing a Jack Reacher movie will be coming out with Tom Cruise playing Jack almost sent me into shock the moment I heard it. That is just an outright insult to my intelligence. Tom Cruise is NO Jack Reacher. Heck even I am taller than Tom Cruise. Sorry...I digress...<br /><br />Prefacing my love for this series, it pains me that I cannot give this book the series normal 5 star review. If you have not read any of Mr. Child's previous Jack Reacher books, please, please do not start with this one. This storyline is not classic Jack. It took 80% of the book to get to any real action and then the ending was totally anti-climactic. I love this series too much to give up on Jack Reacher or Lee Childs so I am going to give him a pass on this and will always continue to see where Jack goes next.<br /><br />Love this quote:<br /><br />\\"Most people squirmed, and got defensive, and got apologetic. Not Reacher. His instinct was to double down, not back down.\\"<br /><br />I've read several reviews where it is questioned if Mr. Child even wrote this book or perhaps just tossed an outline over to a ghost writer. I'm not sure about that but I want Jack back!

B0072GPQNG|4.0|This review is SPOILERS<br />The boy raises the horse (Joey) up and off it goes to war, sold without his consent to save the family farm.  The empathetic officer  who understands Joey's real value buys the horse and pledges the boy he will take good care of the horse.  Money paid is considered  rent and the fine animal will be returned once he comes back from the war.<br /><br />A few weeks / months later, the boy receives the sketchbook of the officer and learns he was killed in action. To the now distraught boy, upset that Joey might have been killed as well console their son saying it was possible Joey was nowhere near the the officer. Therefore Joey may still be alive and perfectly fine.  Meaning the boy cared more about the horse than the dead officer.  In retrospect this is perhaps \\"natural,\\" it is a movie about a horse and after all, the boy knew the officer for all of 5 minutes while doting over the animal for several years.<br /><br />Plot holes exist for dynamic effect, the girl gallops up a hill and is in the middle of a horde of German solders.  Could she not hear or at worst, see the Germans as she poked her head above the rise then turn about before she was in the middle of them?  Perhaps in the real world, yes, but that does not make for swell movie dramatics.<br /><br />As the Germans retreated, the Joey finds himself trapped by a traveling British tank (possibly a Mark V).  The tank was alone, no other troops nearby, odd since such tanks usually have supporting infantry with them.  The horse reaches the a dead end blocked by wire and high steep embankments on all sides.  No way out for the horse.  No way out for the tank and its crew either, perfect spot for a German ambush, or get stuck.  WHERE in the HECK was that tank going?!?  One might think the crew would get a clue from Joey the Panicked Horse who was trying to escape.<br /><br />The creepiest scene in my view was the towing of the German artillery.  The huge metal wheels and peculiar designof the heavy cannon ( possibly a 21 cm Mörser 10) made it a nightmarish weapon to behold.  The film makers did an exceptionally good job in depicting this behind the scenes horror.<br /><br />I felt the most sympathy for the two German brothers.  The movie gave up a bit about their background and their family, concern for the younger brother, only 14 years old.  When the two became separated, the elder brother to take care of the horses and the younger, to march to the front, the elder boy, takes it upon himself to snatch the younger to protect him from possible death and spare their mother the grief of loss.  It ended badly for both of them, a haunting \\"what if;\\" they followed orders, like they signed up to do, for now that poor German mother would have no sons returning from the war.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie, a good way to introduce aspects of World War I, its absurdities,  conundrums and overall unpleasantness.  The film asks us to stretch our  limits of believability at times , where no one wants to put out of its misery, a wired up suffering horse in the middle of no-man's land.  It might be possible to believe a German and an English solder, working to accomplish a mutually beneficial task, (they got together for Christmas back in 1914,) but uber-dark realism does not make for a good family movie about a horse.<br /><br />OH YEAH, I LIKE it when my Germans / Japanese/ Africans and other non English speakers cite the Queens English perfectly.  This means I can LISTEN to the DVD as it plays WITHOUT having to look up at the TV screen disturbing me as I work on other things around the house.<br /><br />+1 star  Non English speakers talk English<br />+1 stars  Feel good story<br />+2 star  interesting plot keeps my attention, the viewer travels with both the German and British armies and gets a taste of how the civilian population fared<br />+1 star  Good background and visual effects  (ie that German cannon, houses WWI battlefield, location shots)<br/>-----<br />  5 stars minus 1 for working a bit too hard at stretching my believability limit.

0802473156|5.0|I bought this book during a deployment in preparation for marriage. At the time, I was in a serious relationship with someone I thought was going to turn out to be \\"the one\\". (Come to find out, I was simply in the \\"in love\\" stage)<br /><br />But I digress. This is an AMAZING book. I didn't realize that it was written for couples who were already married, but nevertheless it has been very beneficial. Once you read the book, you'll start to see the similar pattern many of the married couples were going through because they weren't speaking their spouse's \\"love language.\\" They weren't doing the things their spouse MOSTLY considers unmistakable expressions of love.<br /><br />There were at least two couples in this book who said that they had wished they had known this information (or read this book) 20+ years before so that they could've forgone the years of NOT feeling loved by their spouse. If that's not motivation enough for you to feed on this information Dr. Chapman offers, I don't know what to tell ya.<br /><br />I STRONGLY recommend this book to married couples, couples who plan on being married, and even single folks. There is so much eye-opening wisdom in here that you'd be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring it. It can save you years of hurt & misunderstanding. But positively, it can spur you and your loved one to newer heights of satisfaction and happiness in your relationship. Be blessed.
0805091742|5.0|The Checklist Manifesto is an engaging, entertaining, and enlightening book. Taking the rather simple idea of a checklist, and highlighting usage in well-known areas such as aviation, the author discusses applications in construction, business, and medicine, particularly his expertise, surgery. He illustrates what a checklist is and how it can be utilized to improve processes and reduce errors, and also what it is not. Much of the book centers on creating a safe surgery checklist, and the extensive effort to make such a checklist that enhances patient care and improves patient outcomes, while balancing efficiency and minimal intrusiveness in the surgical workflow.<br /><br />The various examples and stories are fascinating, yet he also engaged my own curiosity as to how I can apply this to my work. Some existing process documents are highly applicable to reworking as checklists, which when completed will also provide a valuable deliverable to the client.<br /><br />I found \\"The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right\\" extremely helpful and enjoyable, and I highly recommend it as a way to improve the outcomes that you provide to your clients.

B000VVZ6HU|5.0|This, the fourth album recorded by the progressive rock band The Alan Parsons Project and released on August 27, 1979 (Arista 9504), deals mostly with the inner strength of women and the many problems they have to endure. That is strikingly and quite effectively demonstrated on the front and back cover art which depicts three veiled ladies, with one half of their face shown in shadows and clearly demonstrating the abuses suffered at the hands of some so-called men.<br /><br />The gathering began in London in 1975 by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, and in North America they would register some 17 hit singles between 1976 and 1986, the first two with 20th Century and the rest with Arista. This album made it to # 13 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts and eventually achieved gold status, also producing the U.S. Hot 100 single Damned If I Do, which reached # 27 in October/November 1979 on Arista 0454 b/w If I Could Change Your Mind. Both these single sides were considerably shorter than the album cuts. Also, the opening instrumental Lucifer became a huge hit in the U.K. and other European markets.<br /><br />The tracks, all written by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, are:<br />Side 1<br />1. Lucifer - 5:09<br />2. You Lie Down With Dogs (lead vocal by Lenny Zakatek) - 3:45<br />3. I'd Rather Be A Man (lead vocal by David Paton) - 3:52<br />4. You Won't Be There (lead vocal by Dave Townsend) - 3:37<br />5. Winding Me Up (lead vocal by Chris Rainbow) - 4:00<br />Side 2<br />1. Damned If I Do (lead vocal by Lenny Zakatek) - 4:50<br />2. Don't Hold Back (lead vocal by Clare Torry) - 3:36<br />3. Secret Garden (instrumental) - 4:40<br />4. If I Could Change Your Mind (lead vocal by Lesley Duncan) - 5:49<br /><br />The musicians/vocalists are: bassist/backing vocalist David Paton; percussionist Stuart Elliott; acoustic/electric guitarist Ian Bairnson; keyboardists Eric Woolfson and Duncan Mackay; the Orchestra Of The Munich Chamber Opera (care of Eberhard Schoener) led by Sandor Farcas; Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson on various other instruments; backing vocalist Chris Rainbow; leads vocals by David Paton, Chris Rainbow, Lesley Duncan, Clare Torry, Dave Townsend and Lenny Zakatek.

I have actually read them twice and realized there were things that I missed the first time.  The sexual content was fluff compared to the real storyline which is how messed up Christian was when he and Anasthia meet compared to where he was when the story ended. The email dialogue between the two was a definite charmer.  I am an excessive reader and Shades is by far my favorite.  It is like a TV series in that I cannot wait until next week to see what they will get into, but sadly there is no continuation.  I would like to see how mentally he has grown after Phoebe is around 5 years old, and what happens with Mia and Ethan.

Amazon's prices were cheaper than anyone in my little town, shipping was free with my prime membership and delivery just as expected. Very happy with my purchase. The movie is based off a book by the same name and if someone has not read it, I would recommend the bookas well. You can watch the movie, follow it and enjoy it without having read the book but reading it does add to the experience and again it is a case of the book is better than the movie. The are three books in the trilogy and the sequel to this movie will be out next year. Also would be a good gift for any young family members who enjoy the genre.

B005IGVZX2|4.0|Just a brief correction at the top of the page where it says the vinyl doesn't come with the 12 page booklet...mine indeed did. Maybe its an early pressing bonus or someone got short changed and didn't get it with their copy? I just picked this up a couple weeks ago though and it was indeed included. Now, that said, I really enjoy this album. It was his recent appearances on Letterman and Jimmy Fallon which prompted me to purchase this album (there are very few artists who I would say should be a strictly vinyl listening experience. Mr. Waits is one of them) and I'm very glad I did. A great rainy day, candlelit three fingers of bourbon kind of album!

B008Z9YLV2|1.0|After my son, husband, and I all read this series of books, we were very excited for the movie(s) to come out.  We couldn't afford the theater, so waited to rent.  I wish I could get my money back  for the rental.  They screwed up the story so badly....left out so many crucial parts of character development, it's a disgrace.<br /><br />I always see a movie through to the end,no matter how bad it is....but I wanted to turn this off after 10 minutes.  What a disappointment.  The worst part about it is that the author of the series Suzanne Collins is also one of the 3 screenplay writers.<br /><br />That should be a warning to you in the future - 3 screenplay writers = too many cooks in the kitchen, and they'll ruin everything....even if one of them was the author herself....she apparently doesn't understand what it is that made her books so fantastic....not the violence, not the games themselves, but the characters, and what they stand for, who they are on a deep level.  I would've had rather had 2 separate movies - 1 just to develop the characters and 1 for the games.  It saddens me that the writers, including the author couldn't see how essential the character development was for these movies.  They may have been intended for teenagers, but the movies are insulting to teenagers' intelligence, much less any adult watching. My dad never read the books and thought the movie was great.....doesn't know what he's missing.<br /><br />I didn't care who lived or died or what happened in the movie....in the book, these things brought tears to my eyes.  And no mention of Kat's dad and how he taught her to hunt, and the song he sang to her?  Ugh, I won't be bothering with the other 2 movies, which are taking far too long to be made, anyway, and don't get me started with the casting.  I mean, Thor's little brother as Gayle, really?  Jennifer Lawrence is as good as she can be with what she was given to work with, as well as Stanley Tucci, both well cast roles.  Lenny Kravitz great choice, unfortunately, one of the most important relationships is between Kat and Cinna, and they didn't even begin to cover that.<br /><br />I'd rather watch any one of the many drop them on an island and have them hunt each other type of movies than have to suffer through a single minute of this garbage again.  So glad I only spent 4 dollars renting it.choice, unfortunately, one of the most important relationships is between Kat and Cinna, and they didn't even begin to cover that.<br /><br />I'd rather watch any one of the many drop them on an island and have them hunt each other type of movies than have to suffer through a single minute of this garbage again.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG!!!  Not at all what I was expecting but a very good book., leaves you breathless and.<br />more than ready for book 2, which by the way is better than the first, just started on book 3, it grabs you from the very beginning just like the other two. Read and enjoy!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this book as we have most of the other Lee Child books. It moves fast and every chapter ending entices you to go on and read one more chapter even if it is 2 a.m. and you have to go to work the next day! We are always looking for the next Reacher book. Keep them coming, Lee!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The amazing popularity of this book (and subsequent movie) enticed me to order it  I admit it was an interesting read, but one appealing to the generation(s) younger than I.  I'm still undecided whether I want to do the sequels.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|The same humor occurs over and over in the American Pie movies. The story line never changes. The only redeeming character was Eugene Levit, quite frankly he is the only reason I rented the movie.
B003U74NQW|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest ever made.  It is mysterious, beautifully-filmed, emotional, and weird--very weird, and yet it's not \\"weird for weird's sake.\\"  The weirdness here is the perversion of the repressed libido (the movie starts with the main character's dad falling to the ground after his \\"water hose gets blocked.\\")<br /><br />There is so much commentary on this movie, it seems silly to delve into it here. What you can rest assured that this is a true cinematic experience, and even today (I just watched it again yesterday), it still has the power to push buttons and be controversial.  But really, underneath, it's just a really well-written movie, with layers of themes, symbolism, music, imagery--all working together to create a cinematic punch you won't find anywhere else.<br /><br />The main theme is that on the surface things might seem perfect and picturesque in any small American town, but underneath, in the dark, in the ground, are bugs and insects...evil people like Frank Booth.  Even the ending, which shows a bird eating a bug is deceptive.  In one way it's a happy ending--but the bird is so deliberately and obviously fake, Lynch is winking at as, saying--nah...no happy ending here. It's a facade like everything else.<br /><br />Then again, there are many angles to cut up this tasty pie of a movie.  For movie geeks, there is a ton to analyze here.  Lynch is a true genius, and even if he learned from other great geniuses like Ingmar Bergman, in movies this like this he really shows how he came into his own, and why the pop culture lexicon of the world has the term \\"Lynchian\\" in it.

B008CJ0KBU|2.0|I liked the idea of this show in the beginning but only watched a few episodes before dropping it from my list of shows. Not into all the sex junk which sucks because I love the idea of all the different creatures etc! Not for me or a friend of mine. I hope they put out another good show with less of that crap! Syfy has many other shows I love and I give 5 stars so it's all good!

0142000671|5.0|John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is both an enlightening and heartbreaking story of two friends going through a life of work together. George is a small man who is committed to taking care of Lennie, a large, strong, mentally disabled man, after his Aunt Clara's death. George always complains about how his life would be easier if he didn't have to take care of Lennie, but truly cares for him and tells him of their plans to have a farm of their own when they get enough money. Lennie loves the story of their future farm and always asks George to tell him about how someday he will get to take care of the rabbits. Lennie loves the soft touch of animals' hair which later gets him into trouble with the wife of a man who works on the farm of their new job.<br /><br /> Lennie always seemed to be the outcast in the novel, even by George who told him not to speak when going for their new job, for fear that Lennie would not be allowed to work, or be seen as \\"dumb.\\" Published in 1937, Of Mice and Men does not show signs of inclusion for those who are mentally disabled, nor any understanding of those who have disabilities. However, even though this novel does not show good examples of inclusion or understanding, it can still teach its readers positively about individuals with disabilities.<br /><br /> Although this is a short novel, John Steinbeck allows this book to pull at its readers' hearts as well as teach lessons of life and love through the relationship of George and Lennie. Of Mice and Men would be a perfect book to teach at a high school level even though it is a seemingly easy read. There are themes throughout the book that would help students understand isolation, friendship, and strengths versus weaknesses. Even if there are no students with disabilities in the classroom or the school, students can learn from this novel the importance of inclusion even outside of the classroom. A class can even learn from this story about alienating students who don't have disabilities but still feel that they do not \\"fit in.\\" I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read, no matter what age. I think that it teaches its readers a lot about life, no matter who comes into our lives and no matter how different they may be.

B0071T4BVC|5.0|It is great to see Sir Paul back in the saddle. After that last wife he had, whom proved she was NO muse, it looks like once again Paul has a Muse in his corner. Linda was a terrible loss for both Paul and the rest of the world as she took with her the heart of the greatest songwriter alive. But now Paul is back writing, singing and living again. I put this on the player. Listened to it and loved it right from the start. Second time through I found myself singing all the songs with Paul as though I had known them all my life.... and some of them I did. I really do think that Valentine will be as great as Yesterday, so give it a listen and join the band. Sir Paul is back!!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Surely Lee Child has a big enough team to stop him making huge mistakes like this book. His last book was fabulous and so the expectation for this book was high. I was unfortunately so disappointed! I have read all the Jack Reacher books and this is the only one that has disappointed.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I use to love this app.  I used it all the time and watched the vids through on my Fire 1st gen.  Gallery App. I have been caught up in the FireHD and didn't use it in the last week or so.  Saw a post on discussion board about it not working any more and hoped it was user error or some other work around.  No soch luck.  I did all I could think of such as deleting old vids within the app itself, which I had not remembered to do since i used the Gallery to view.  Made sure i had storage room since I had been using DroidTV, deleted history,cookies,cache and data, did a hard reboot and a reinstall, no go.  The Fire had recieved a software update to 6.3.1 about 2 weeks ago, I wonder if this has anything to do with this problem? Regardless this App doesn't work anymore. A shame, it was really good.

B0075LTOR2|5.0|Outstanding box set.<br />The sound is excellent and the packaging makes this one of the more attractive box sets in recent years.<br />Besides the studio albums, you also get two cds of bonus material which is mostly centered around the singles<br />and US versions of singles.<br />Not anything unexpected really but what is presented is top notch.<br />I would like have seen perhaps a book with this but I do like this just the same.<br />Alot of times I'd like to get the remastered original album without a ton of songs tacked on at the end.<br />The album presented as the way it was when originally released.<br />Then throw whatever bonus tracks either on disc 2, or separate cds in this case.<br />The mini album covers are nice and they use a gatefold version to duplicate the original packaging.<br />Roxy was always a class act and they continue with this box, which I hope ends all the other box sets they've released.<br />Enjoy !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me interested from beginning to end! Can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy. I would recommend this book to all!

B009329ZF2|5.0|Rented this movie and had to admit I had seen reviews of people putting the movie down but I really enjoyed it and would would recommend the movie to anyone.
055358202X|3.0|So many reviews already articulate my dissatisfaction with the 4th book in the series; e.g., the multiplicity of inconsequential characters, the disappearance of characters readers care about, muddled narrative, the dark & depressing ambiance; BUT the characters Martin lets us hold on to are so compelling we want to hang on to find out what happens to them.  Despite the flaws, the world Martin has created is compelling and addictive.  Stop me before I pick up the next one! (But like every addict, I will be reaching for the next fix as soon as my pusher lets me have it.)<br />[[ASIN:B006KF64QS Islands in My Dreams]]

034580404X|3.0|It was interesting to read the books and suddenly think in Edward Cullen while you read...<br />The first book is pretty good, but PLEASE second and third, don´t know how I have the guts to read them.... It´s like reading a soap opera in Televisa (Mexico).<br />Any way, I will wait for the motion picture just to see in action the kinky Grey, ohh yeees!!!<br /><br />I recommend second and third books only if you don´t have anything else to do, and if you´re a very very very very pink reader.

B008BM9L72|4.0|I recommend to read the trilogy to all the women who want to refresh their intimate relationship. These novels show how a pair can be happy if they get free of prejudice and help each other in building strong relations. And of course the details are lovely and truly exciting! :)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app for my daughter while she sleeps. I will admit that some of the tones are not exactly friendly to use on a new born, but there are plenty that are. I do enjoy that you can combine the sounds to create your own peaceful atmosphere. Not only for your children, but also when you need to relax.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The colors are nice and bright and the cards are clear. The game play is smooth. You can choose how many suits to play which keeps it interesting. I play it before going to bed so have had to make a rule. After winning once put it down! Fun and interesting.
B006VA57CY|5.0|Despite the buzz about this series, I waited until well after Season 2 to give it a go. Within scene 1, of episode 1 (Season 1), I was hooked. Season 2 brings even more reason to love the Downton Abbey story. The characters are uniquely affected by the War; the writers did an outstanding job of showing the affects of the war on their lives and psyches. I hadn't studied much of the Edwardian period prior to seeing this series. Bravo for bring history to life. In each episode I learned as much as I am entertained.

B005LAII6W|4.0|I am a fan of the RE series, and much like the Underworld franchise, these are more fun and enjoyable than great pieces of cinema. The CGI and action scenes are the best of the five movies and this is a huge step up from Afterlife, though the plot and dialogue can be just as weak at times.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is back at what she does best (and looks good doing it) and so are a bunch of characters from previous installments. The actor who played Leon couldn't act worth a darn, but everyone else did okay.<br /><br />I loved the reverse slow motion opening credits, complete with some nice music. The fight scenes with Alice and the chain in the white hallway and the finale with her against Jill Valentine were the highlights for me. The ending was pretty epic, setting up what looks to be the last entry in this action packed series.<br /><br />The IMAX 3-D was good. Not really worth double price, but it added more than it took away.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have tried many applications to work on MS documents on my Xoom.  Most fell way short of the mark in ease of use and interface with existing *.dox and *.xls documents.  Don't get me started on creating new documents.  While on a trip I had to create a new document for my team and all I had was my tablet.  I found this application on Amazon and tried it.  Within 10 minutes I purchased the Pro version.  If you are like me and are trying to cut the chains of hauling a laptop on trips you have got to try this application.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I have loved reading the Harry Potter series and get to do it all over again with my daughter.  As she reads each installment, we follow up with the movie.  She is quickly trying to finish her book so she can see what they've done with the movie.  I loved that this was a super savings shipping item (or whatever the free shipping deal is called).  I don't mind waiting a little longer in order to get free shipping!
B005LLSLPE|1.0|As a biker, I think this gives the average thrill-seeking citizen a skewed idea of what outlaw MCs are about. I think this show is kind of silly, but to each their own.

B0012PDVQ2|4.0|A classic movie. Some of the technology looks a bit \\"aged\\" at this point but the plot still works and the dark photography is still chilling.
B001LMT50W|5.0|Coldplay's 'Viva La Vida' was a delightful buy for me. I didn't make it a point to start buying all of their albums until about two years ago... though I've always liked what I 'd heard/seen of them from radio, TV, internet, etc. So I purchased this album, having already heard their newest 'Mylo Xyloto' and all the others, wanting to hear it in the order they originally placed the songs in, because I feel it's the best way to get a feel for what any artist wants to portray that particular album as.<br /><br />When I began listening to this album, I was entirely refreshed on what type of band I always thought Coldplay was. While a lot of fans argue that this album is the one when they took a jog from their original sound, and didn't like this new approach... I was taken aback at the soaring orchestral rhythms in the ever-popular title track and my personal favorite of the album: \\"Yes\\", along with the feel good tracks of \\"Life In Technicolor\\", \\"Lovers in Japan\\", and \\"Strawberry Swing\\", and then the ballads of \\"Lost!' and \\"Cemeteries of London\\" hit just the right heartstrings on my musical heart.<br /><br />I'd already marked the X&Y album as my favorite set of songs, lyrically speaking.<br />But the further I examined Viva La Vida, the more I realized that never had I ever before said to myself whilst listening to Coldplay, \\"Wow! Did you hear that awesome violin in their?\\" or \\"I wish I had this track with music only\\" ... and these things I have said to myself after listening to this album.<br /><br />Here's my conclusion:<br />Viva La Vida is my favorite Coldplay album when it comes to stepping up their musical ability.
0374214913|5.0|Overview:<br />When I selected this invigorating little novel, I saw the description which likened it to luminaries Murakami Haruki, Neal Stephenson, and Umberto Eco. With a panel of names like that, there really wasn't a choice NOT to pick it up. Not to mention a positive review from that Curator of the Curious, Nick Harkaway.<br /><br />A quick search using your favorite browser software and the title of this book should churn up the author's own site, where a short story version of this can be read for free. The book is a different story, though, so you'd probably be better off stopping after the description of the bookstore in the short, online version.<br /><br />A. Plot/Backstory<br />Clay needs a job. Recently let go as an industrial designer/artist, Clay needs to find a way to pay rent. On an introspective walk, he notices a strange little store, called Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. Upon entering, he finds a curious, dusty, and book-lined crevasse whose owner greets him with a twinkle in his eye and the question, \\"What do you seek?\\"<br /><br />If that doesn't catch your attention, you probably should just walk away now. If it does, you probably don't need to read any more. If you're in the 1% of people who still can't make up your mind, the rest of the review should hopefully convince you.<br /><br />One of the most refreshing aspects of the plot here is that the author doesn't make this a battle of good vs. evil. The world isn't getting destroyed here, and, ultimately, the conflicts, the resolutions, and the rewards are things that are personal, not global. And that is kind of nice. It isn't a globe-trotting adventure of high-finance and international spies that we're talking about...it's a bunch of nerds and their books, their fonts, their designs. At the end of the day, it's not something that will get your adrenaline pumping, but it will probably put a smile on your face, which is really much better.<br /><br />B. Characters<br />There are several interesting characters here. The most important of these are Clay, Mr. Penumbra, and Kat (Clay's girlfriend). The supporting cast is also strange, fun, and generally unique.<br /><br />Clay is your typical everygeek. He used to work in website design, but takes the job at Mr. Penumbra's because he needs the money. But you get the feeling that Clay would probably have taken it over something like his old job anyway, since he is a curious and kindred spirit to Mr. Penumbra. Through the course of the story, its fun to watch Clay develop into a more complete person, which is something characters should always do.<br /><br />Kat, Clay's girlfriend, is an ideal girlfriend for most geeks. She's smart, beautiful, and nerdy. But she does tend to be somewhat absorbed in her own things in the course of the book. Not that this is inherently a bad thing, but it does tend to limit her involvement as a character. It also makes her seem a bit...obsessive and spooky. She doesn't really grow as much as Clay in the book, either. But the resolution of the Kay and Clay plotline was something that I enjoyed.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra is probably one of the most curious characters in the book (at least...main characters; the supporting characters are just bizarre). Penumbra (and his counterpart) represent something of the same battle as the stated conflict between Old Knowledge and New Knowledge. The conflict between the two demonstrates most of the development of Penumbra's character. But he really feels kind of fun, like a grandpa that you wish that you had.<br /><br />C. Setting<br />The story is set in a wealth of different locations, from Mr. Penumbra's titular bookstore to the the underground vaults of the Unbroken Spine, from Clay's weird little apartment to the hallowed halls of Google. Nicely enough, each setting in interesting, described well, and they generally contribute to the plot.<br /><br />D. Themes<br />The major theme here is transcendance. Each of the characters are seeking to accomplish a goal, which is growing past some limitation that they have. Watching most of their quests and developments leave you feeling pretty good.<br /><br />There is a clear secondary theme of the conflict between progress and the associated uncertainty that it brings and conservativism and the stagnation that it represents. The author has a clear preference, as shown in the resolution of the conflict between the two sides, but the absence of vilification of either side (or calling either side unambigiously heroic) makes it really nice.<br /><br />E. Point of View/Voice<br />The story is told from the point of view of Clay, which allows us to discover the mysteries of the Unbroken Spine alongside him. The voice is third person, limited omniscience, which is just about perfect. Third person omniscient from a perspective watching Clay would also have been an interesting, if vastly harder to pull off, choice.<br /><br />F. Aesthetics<br />The book generally FEELS legitimately like its from Clay's perspective, which is the perspective that people who will enjoy this book will share (i.e., the perspective of a nerd). While it remains to be seen (with his second book), whether this was a conscious effort or merely Robin Sloan's writing style, it certainly works here. It contributes very nicely to the story.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I started recommending this to people before I reached page fifty. That's usually a good sign, although it's occasionally risky, because authors can sometimes screw it up. Especially first authors. Robin Sloan, who is a first author, carries it off well, and I will be eagerly anticipating his second book.<br /><br />A<br /><br />Harkius

B008JTK9NW|5.0|Lyriclly sound and on point. P.O.D. have once again shown that Jesus raines in all we do. No matter how heavy or soft. If your heart is in the right place it will show. This album is AMAZING! and for those concerned about the use of the \\"F\\" word, it is understandable. However, if you listen with an open heart and mind you can see the truth that Sonny is preaching. The point is to hear the message and not the law. if I remember correctly, I do believe that is what Jesus came, died and rose again so that we would get that. It's not about the laws but the relationship.<br /><br />This album speaks so much louder than the music that crunches its message and truth. Hear and don't just listen to this album and know God's love.<br /><br />Thank you POD, you have not disappointed but exceeded all expectations on this one.  One more thing. Those who didn't so much like \\"Angles and Serpants Dance\\" as I said before, try hearing and not just listening to it. I thought it was great. Check it out if you haven't before now.<br /><br />Eastern Shore Charlie

0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was recomended to me back in 2009. I was skeptical at first because I don't really read dramatic novels. I don't have anything against them, I'm just more of a fantasy/horror guy. But when I learned that the story was told from a dog's point of view I decided to give it a go being a huge dog person myself. I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />Enzo has quickly become one of my favorite characters of all time. He is a wise and perceptive dog who is ready to become a man in his next life. He hates not being able to talk, he watches too much TV and he loves his owner Denny. Denny is a race car driver and according to Enzo one of the best there is. The story actually begins when Denny meets Eve. They eventually have their daughter Zoe and everything seems perfect. But it doesn't last. Denny goes through many hardships throughout the story which include losing his wife to cancer and fighting for custody of his daughter.<br /><br />The author uses his own love and experiences of racing as metaphors for much of what Denny has to endure and overcome. And while the story is mainly about the love that Denny has for his wife and daughter it is also about the connection he has with Enzo. They both share an almost mystical and spiritiual bond that drives (no pun intended whatsoever) the story wonderfully.<br /><br />The story is pretty heartbreaking, there's no doubt about that but it will also make you laugh (beware the evil zebra) and maybe even make you think about the way you look at dogs. I would recommend it whether you're a dog person or not or whether you're a racing fan or not because it is about so much more than that. It's about fighting for what you love and about not giving up even when things seem hopeless. I have read this book a few times since coming across it and I'm certain that I will revisit Enzo many more times in the future, like revisiting an old friend who I haven't seen in a while, only this friend happens to walk on all fours.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is full of great ideas! I have already found tons of things to try! Worth the time to check it out!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Let´s state this first: this book IS summer reading.Having said that I can say that the plot is not great, the characters have some flaws but it is easy reading and couldn´t put it down. The sex scenes are effective and felt like the writer knows what she is talking about. Sometimes the scenes get repetitive and at a point you expect a bit more from the author. If you want light reading and would not get offended with sex scenes that are sort of erotic ( not heavy sado)go for it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|There isnt much I can say about this book with out gushing and sending spoilers everywhere. It is a beautifully written book and the characters make you fall in love with them from the moment you meet them (especially Travis)! I can't wait for Walking Disaster!
0525953728|5.0|1. \\"As Owen and I worked on the book, we had an eye toward the next generation of operators. The book was never going to be an expose on the mission to Abbottabad. ...\\"    Kevin Maurer  [...]    2. During a recent 60 Minutes interview, a SEAL Team 6 member who fired at a subject alleged to be Osama Bin Laden, said that the subject did not look like Bin Laden.    Question (60 Minutes): \\"Did you recognize him?\\" Answer (SEAL Team 6 Member): \\"No\\".  Earlier this year, in response to an open records request, the Pentagon told the Associated Press it could not locate any photographs or video taken during the raid or showing Bin Laden's body. It also said it could not find any images of Bin Laden's body on the Navy aircraft carrier where the al-Qaida leader's body was taken. The Pentagon also said it could not find any death certificate, autopsy report or results of DNA identification tests for Bin Laden.[...]

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|One of the better album in this genre I've purchased.  Stubborn Love and Slow It Down are by far my favorites in this whole album.
0316023744|5.0|After reading probably 100 books about WWII this is one of the best.  True, it's an overview and therefore can't focus on everything.  It has good coverage of areas that we in the US don't usually hear about; the Eastern front and the Burma campaign.  I strongly recommed this book, it's well written, well documented and even handed.
B0090EKRKU|4.0|Looking for some family fun, you've found it. Great fun for the whole family. A must see especially if you're a fan of Dr. Seuss books. Check it out!
B0072OFM28|5.0|I absolutely LOVED the first season of Spartacus, LOVED IT! My wife and I smoked through the first season box set like a wood chipper on crack! The second season will not disappoint the fans either. It's a shame the lead actor (Spartacus) passed due to cancer and couldn't shoot season two. He will be missed, he nailed the role perfectly. That being said his replacement made the transition seem near seamless. It certainly could have been a lot worse.<br /><br />I didn't feel as invested in season two as season one, but that is nit picking. I still tore through the box set in two days and would have been happy with ten more episodes.<br /><br />Worth every penny.
0307959856|2.0|While the writing was very well done, the plot left something to be desired. I detest books in which the reader has absolutely NO opportunity to even guess what could really be happening. Three quarters of the way through, the characters just explain how the resolution comes to be, without any attempt to let the reader figure it out themselves. I will say though that PD James kind of hits you over the head with the ancillary characters, leading you to believe they're more involved that you would expect. And talk about red herrings!<br /><br />All in all, I enjoying the style, but the overall book was a bust for me.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|This is a real stinker. Story was weak and not \\"believable\\", editing was not great, characters were one dimensional and worst of all this is one of those movies where they try and make every viewer happy and just end up making it no good for anyone.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I've been a fan of the Bourne Trilogy since it came out in the movie theaters and has revived the spy action thrillers and twists which has become mostly action here and there without much a story to work on. The Bourne Trilogy set comes in nice package fit for 3 discs and basically if you have watched all three films and wanted to know more of the background you will not be disappointed with the set! Here is my review broken into each of the movie included.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity<br />The extras included in this disc are great! Even some alternative scenes that are not found on previous DVD releases. This is a must-have for the fans. I wont give any spoilers. Even a psychologist's diagnosis of Jason Bourne!<br /><br />The Bourne Supremacy<br />Action sequences are given due credit here and even documentaries. There are extras after the car chase scene in Goa, India and interviews with Matt Damon and Franka Potente.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum<br />There are SO MANY extras here! Many documentaries and sections about the film and Robert Ludlum! You'll enjoy this very much!

Her message to all of us: \\"You can survive against insurmountable odds, find and reconnect with your true self, and keep moving forward.\\"  Jaycee's strength, love for her family, and ability to step out of herself to reflect and resolve her ghastly experience is truly inspiring. Thank you Jaycee!

B005KELQEU|5.0|Previous reviews have cast doubt on this product's suitability for the Kindle Touch.  I have to disagree, although at first I wasn't sure.  Once it's been used a couple times or so, it is not a problem to fit the Touch.  The case itself provides lots of protection, and I like it.
030758836X|2.0|I'd heard many good things about this book and thought it would be a good summer read. I thought the start of the book was a tad slow but the action and twists got quite exciting in the middle. I was pretty riveted to the story developments and, based on what the author presented, enjoyed guessing at how it might end. Had I reviewed the book midway through reading it, I would have probably lauded the cleverness of the writing and of each plot twist as well as the surprises the two main characters' actions gave the reader.<br />  However, when I finally got to the ending, it changed my whole opinion of the book. The build up and excitement and twists and surprises that I'd enjoyed turned way too bizarre in the last section of the book. Hoping, HOPING that it would lead to an interesting and satisfying ending, it was a total and ultimate disappointment when it did not. The end falls flat, does not even FEEL like an ending and I actually thought my Kindle had left out the last chapter. Unfortunately it didn't. As one other reviewer observed, one tends to remember a book by how it leaves you feeling at the end. Thus, I will no longer recommend the book and am left with a negative feeling. I initially cared about Nick and Amy and the book's resolution. Too bad there wasn't a resolution and it was all too easy to stop caring about this deeply troubled and weird couple.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have an almost 2 yo who loves playing with the apps on my iPhone. Thank goodness for Lifeproof case bc she has dropped my phone, spilled things on it and it held up!

B0067EKY7M|1.0|I was very disapointed to receive my copy of the DVD Salmon Fishing in the Yemen and find that it is only playable in the United States, It is going to cost me has much to send it back as I paid for it. I suppose my fault for placing the order, but what stupid person sent this to me, knowing that I would not be able to play it it in England. very shabby way to treat a customer. I shall not be buying another DVD this way. So no good words to say, and yes a good film I purchased another DVD of the film that plays in England,!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0085A9J18|1.0|This was one of the worst top 10. The acting was bad, the script was bad. Too much profanity in the wrong places as well as the fighting was horrible. What were they fighting for???? The whole movie didn't make sense or have direction. Don't waste your money on this, like I did to rent from Redbox.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I love this one with Jeremy Renner playing the new Bourne, even though he's playing an entirely new character. I never like Matt Damon portraying Jason Bourne, who just lacks the muscle and determination that the character is supposed to convey to the audience. He is witty, I'll give him that, but not quite the Bourne I picture should be. The new one played by Jeremy Renner is, on the other hand, strong, muscular, and willful. The movie is action packed with intelligence intertwined, totally enjoyable watching compared to the previous Bourne series. Rachael Weisz is a great addition to the movie too. Her intense chemistry with the new Bourne is undeniable which adds more softness to the otherwise hard core Bourne movie. All in all I like the new combination of characters and brilliant portrays by the actors. I will definitely collect the DVD when it's available.

1564588599|4.0|The Visual Dictionary of Prehistoric Life talks about everything from the formation of the Earth to the mammals. It talks about everything including<br /><br />dinosaurs, sea reptiles, and mammals. There's only one thing that's negative about this book: I wish there were more facts on the Tyrannosaurus Rex. In<br /><br />fact, I wish that EVERY prehistoric book featured more facts on that dinosaur. Forget the T-Rex. Overall, this book is a GREAT find for teachers<br /><br />everywhere.
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|I should've just rented this from the library rather than spending 2 or 3 dollars on it. As usual, Kristen Stewart is very 2-dimensional but the story itself isn't reliant on any Snow White story line, nor is it rich with a good, cohesive plot or fleshed out characters. Charlize Theron and Lily Cole are about the only interesting characters in the whole film.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth is good; he certainly has talent and depth but I kept wondering what was going to happen with him and Snow White (what was with the lips on lips kiss he gives Snow while she's in her death-sleep?) Was there anything between them at all? Was there anything between Snow and William? What's going on with that? The whole curse/spell the evil queen is under is the central focus of her place in the story and the crux of the relationship between Snow White and the evil queen but everything else is so confusing and non-sequiter-like. Main themes are hardly carried all the way through and fully developed. On top of that Kristen's acting, it's just so...bad!

B007QNRMUU|5.0|If you are a fan of Jason Mraz, you know how beautiful the music he make can be. This album is a little bit softer and not quite as upbeat as his earlier releases. This isn't to say that the music is depressing, he is focusing on soothing melodies and of course, love songs. This is music I use at the end of the day to relax a bit and wind down. This one is easy to recommend for fans or anybody who has heard his new single and wants more of the same.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Definitely the best trilogy and made me escape and feel what the character was feeling and experiencing.<br />An erotic tale with a hidden story behind evey turn. Captivating right from the beginning til the end !!!
B005V1WYZC|2.0|Somehow the makers of this movie took two of my favorite actors - Julianne Moore and Ryan Gosling - and made them so phony and annoying that I could barely watch; and they magnified all of Steve Carell's most annoying traits so that he was even more obnoxious than usual. I don't think it was supposed to be that way, based on other people's reviews, but that's how it hit me.<br /><br />I guess Carell fans love anything he does; gasp with amazement any time he manages to cry or to read a line without making a funny face or a funny noise, and tell themselves what a great dramatic actor he is in addition to being the funniest man in the world; and they probably don't care or even notice how anybody else comes across. That's the only way I can account for the vast multitudes who rave about how profound (huh?) this silly, irritating movie is and how phenomenal (awesome, anybody?) Carell is in it. I don't get it, but then I'm obviously not a fan.<br /><br />And I'm sick of movies that get laughs from pubescent boys getting caught doing what they all do in their rooms any time they're alone and of angst-ridden teenage crushes on older men/women. Those two dumb themes have been done to death.<br /><br />To summarize this review: this is a stupid, boring, obnoxious and annoying movie that wastes at least two great talents in a stupid, clichéd story about stupid, totally obnoxious and unbelievable characters.

0425263908|1.0|After finishing 50 shades triology,i still needed a fix. The back cover of this book boast that if u loved 50 Shades you'd love this. WRONG! I wouldn't have mind it being a copy cat, if it was still good. The lack of originality was 1 thing but the author did not develope the characters or their relationship/attraction. The crazy obsession& immediate jealousy displayed by both didnt flow.<br /> I only made it to pg 185 when I could not take any more! ....She shares w him that she had been repeatly raped as a child by her stepbrother & ended up miscarrying. Instead of the author using this moment to develope the male character by having him comfort/hold her, he opens up his rope to show her his hard-on & they start going at it (WTF?) Who gets turned on after hearing something like that!! I refuse to read another pg. Disgustingly stupid!!

0307271862|1.0|Henning Mankell at his best is wonderful. In The Man from Beijing he is sleep-walking. The plot is non-credible, merely a vehicle for secondhand political history about China. Characterization is all but nonexistent and the writing is mechanical, much of it just filler. I expect his inkwell was dry but the publisher was demanding something. Don't waste your time.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I use this to replace the thermal \\"junk\\" that comes pre-smeared on computer components.

Just check other reviews. I wouldn't use anything else.
0345803485|3.0|The author does a good job of  reflecting realistic emotion patterns of an immature and inexperienced young woman. But, frankly, there was so much detailed sex scenes that it became desensitising and boring. The second book in the trilogy was  better as it had more substance yet still had erotic element.  Further, the fact that every encounter ended in multiple sex events and orgasims at the drop of a word, passed the point of being ridiculous, even for 20 something year old characters.

031219126X|5.0|When I first heard about Frankenstein from my friend and watched the movie, I thought this was a horrible movie which was about a psychological disordered scientist and the monster that he created. However, when I read the book, especially after I searched the author Mary Shelley's background, I realize that this is such a profound story which illustrates race discrimination issues, life tragedy, and so many other topics that we are still struggling with today. I consider Frankenstein combines the elements of Mary Shelley's life, for Victor Frankenstein, a talented scientist who obsessed with creating a new life from dead body, has the same tragedy life as Mary Shelley. In the book, Victor Frankenstein lost his mother, father and lover incessantly. In reality, Mary Shelley lost her father, child, and husband and died alone. In the end, Victor Frankenstein chases behind the monster in the North Pole and tries to kill him, just like Mary Shelley wanted to capture and kill her fate and get out of its control. I love this book because of its rich contents and the issues that it connects with.

0439023513|5.0|Unless you live under a rock, you will have heard of this series and know this is a final book. While it did come together in the end, and beautifully at that, I still felt a little hung up. I need more. I don't care if it's a final book, I need to know more.... did her last questions go her way?? I have to know!!!<br />As you can see, I hate that. Authors tell you no, and leave you screaming yes. It's brutal!<br />But that also shows how awesome the book is. Lures you in till you can't get enough and then BAM! You're hooked. So when it finishes, it's all you can think about.<br />Man, I'll be talking about this trilogy for a while. That's for sure! Maybe I'll start emailing the author begging for a fourth book? No, too much? Well, I'll have to suffice with recommending it to everyone on the planet I come in contact with.<br />Oh, and by the way... Cinna is still my favorite. Hands down. Love me some Lenny Kravitz, and through the whole second and third book, every time Cinna was mentioned, left me daydreaming.... woooweeee!!!!<br />K, I may have spoiled some minor casting detail, but no biggie.... you'll get over it when you get 'er done. So get on it!
1469984202|5.0|A friend of mine loaned me his copy of Wool and, with no preconceived notions, I dove in. Howey has created a fascinating and detailed world that I'm sure (or at least hope) will yield numerous additional stories. I'm also looking forward to reading his other works.<br /><br />Wool is not flawless - the pace slows down a bit at times, there are occasional technical issues, and the author has the unpleasant habit of creating interesting, caring, loveable characters... and then killing them off. But Wool is epic in both scope and size, and I found it to be a compelling read. I can't wait for the next installment in the saga.

B001ANSSDC|1.0|This book reads like a young adult novel. It is repetitious and predictable. If you take out the play by plays of the Eagles games, the Eagles cheers, his compulsive workouts and his wordless runs with Tiffany you are left with a 12 page novel without structure or a plausible plot.<br />There is very little insight to the characters of his friends and family. I gave the book a little grace, assuming it was one purposely one dimensional to reflect the fact the main character is addled on 12 different medications. But after 300 pages of flat personalities I felt I was going to need a couple of those meds.<br />The storyline is weak, implausible and boring. The final `reveal'-the reason he went to the `dark place' (and the only thing that kept me reading) made me go `huh?.  It is improbable that a middle class family could afford to house a former school teacher (whose wife got all his assets) in a mental health facility for 4 years. It is also very unlikely the courts would have sent him there for what transpired.<br />I was very surprised at the numerous 4/5 star reviews. Save your money for the movie.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I'm always in love with BBC Dickens adaptations, so I don't know if I am the best \\"critical\\" source. This mini-series has such wonderful actors, all who really capture the unique idiosyncrasies of each of the characters. I'm glad BBC puts great efforts into the costumes and set design (as well as casting) because it truly makes a difference. Doing an adaptation like this requires an all or nothing attitude, and BBC really went full out to put on a great production.

OF course I'll be contacting Amazon once the separate \\"Wagner's Dream\\" shows up as it has already shipped as well. There was NO mention of Wagner's Dream being part of this box set anywhere in the description so of course there was no way of my knowing it would be there.<br /><br />I just wonder how many other people have found themselves in a similar situation? I do not know if it is Amazon's fault or DG's fault in this instance but either way it should be corrected ASAP. Normally I would say \\"Caveat emptor\\" but in this case I do hold both Amazon and DG responsible for not ensuring that the product description was complete.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I first read this book when I was 7-8 years old, and I remember how long it took me, as at the time, it was the longest book I had ever read!  After spending all summer in the UK, I decided to read it again.  It is a magical story, and I loved it as an adult just as I did as a child- but did miss the beautiful illustrations that I remember from my childhood!

0393338398|5.0|The stupidity of refusal to change in spite of evidence isn't limited to professional baseball, but Michael Lewis shows clearly how that entrenched attitude has ruled major league baseball.<br /><br />The book will keep even non-baseball lovers involved in the account of how the Oakland `A's and their manager, Billy Beane won games for years without spending huge amounts of money like most other teams.<br /><br /> Beane and his side-kick Paul DePodesta analyzed statistics about what was most important in choosing players who could win ball games. Their results should have changed the game for everyone. Instead, managers and owners who never read Money Ball insisted that Beane was an egotistical author, never realizing he had NOT written the book, nor was really aware of the volume until after publication.<br /><br />The irony of uncovering professional baseball realities will keep readers either chuckling or wondering in unbelief how grown men could be so ignorant and stubborn. One of the delights of the book! Hopefully methods of choosing players have improved in the years since Money Ball was written and became a major motion picture.
0785152458|2.0|I was very excited to read the sequel to Millar and Romita's Kick Ass comic to see where they would take the characters. From the way Kick Ass 1 ended , it was assumed that Hit Girl would be out of the picture (\\"she never raised her hand in violence again\\") and that Kick Ass, while not living happily ever after, had started a real movement with other ordinary people wanting to be superheroes. I expected a lot , and was hoping to see how it would be carried out.<br /><br />What I got seems to me to be a gross piece of gorenography. First, the suspension of disbelief gets lost after Red Mist returns with his band of villains. One can expect to read an unbelievable premise from a comic  book (10 year old ninja girl that can beat up grown men), and this goes along with the territory. But the storyline loses credibility when it becomes disjointed and false to it's premise.<br /><br />Red Mist reappears , using his father's money to hire a homicidal merc, and using social media to start a sub culture of wannabe super villains using Twitter and Myspace. Okay that is plausible so far. But when Red Mist and his gang kill one of the the new heroes in a gross and disturbing way, then kill a number of toddlers , civilians and police officers while engaging in a rape of one Kick Ass's acquaintances, this all seems to be so far fetched as to be ridiculous. Supposedly, Red Mist gathered the info about Kick Ass's crush during the torture scene in Kick Ass 1. You remember that , when they had a car battery attached to his genitals and were torturing him for info as to who hired Big Daddy and Hit Girl? What's the likelihood that Red Mist would care or even remember the details of Dave's crush? Why would he? For all he knew, he as certain Kick Ass was going to die after they got the information about who hired Big Daddy. That was the only relevant information. Anything else was of very little value unless it pertained to that. It could not be used against him later as he thought KickAss would be dead later. No, this plot point was added so that, like in every bad revenge piece, the girl can be raped by the villain.  It was formulaic and pointless. I just started asking the simple questions: If villains are being instructed to commit mass murder just for fun mind you) via the internet, wouldn't the police be aware? If Dave's friend at school knows the identity of one of the Goth guys in his class as one of the villains on the board, wouldn't the cops be aware? If Red Mist was calling for a super villain terror plot, and Chris Genovese was found in a Red Mist costume surrounded by the 34 bodies of his father and dad's goons about a year prior, shouldn't the cops be looking for him? Shouldn't the mob be out stopping him? Would Goth kids who want to be villains for kicks and giggles really keep up when this idiot starts lopping peoples heads off? Would even hardened criminals with any sense of self preservation not understand that killing cops and little kids has no upside and won't get you very rich at the end of the day?<br /><br />Even with the rape, even when the kids died, even when a primary character died,  I really felt little as by that time I was chalking the whole of Kick Ass 2 as a wet dream Red Mist is having in Bellevue's loony bin. The carnage is so cartoonish, the reactions so fake , it boggles the mind. This is definitely, in Kick Ass' terms, a \\"Heroes Season 2\\" book. I hope in Kick Ass 3, the first scene is his dad coming out of shower, and Kick Ass amazed that it must have all been a bad dream.

B004L03B3S|5.0|This movie turned out to be nothing like I thought it would. A truly beautiful love story. Though the director DID get a little over symbolic sometimes, it was overall a wonderful, heartwarming movie. I didn't know what to make of the ending but I think it's sort of left up to us.<br />Well done.

B005WUHAX8|2.0|The lifeproof case touts itself as being waterproof to 6 ft.  This comes with the burden of bulk and touch sensitivity on the screen (you must press hard for the screen to respond).  But we wanted something to completely protect our phones while on summer vacation and so ordered two.  Unfortunately, one of the two cases would not stay snapped completely closed around the phone.  The other case seemed to be completely sealed, but leaked while underwater completely soaking the phone.  We have returned both cases.<br /><br />If all you want is a good solid case for your iphone and you don't mind the bulk or the touch screen annoyance, this may be a good choice.  But there are other less expensive non-\\"waterproof\\" cases that do the job just as well.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Lots of fun and challenging. It was free but well worth the 99 cents<br />Really like would recommend to all
0525953728|5.0|I thought this was a great read!  The author gives an interesting glimpse of life as a Navy SEAL.  I liked how the author's background and training are weaved in throughout the book.  I usually cannot sit for hours reading a book but I couldn't put the book down - I ended up finishing it in about 5 hours over a 24 hour period.
B00846REIS|4.0|Has a lot of similarities to the fifty series. Not as naughty as fifty though. it was a good read!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love the mellow music. It makes the game stress free.<br />Very addictive and enjoyable. Only game ive ever played where I didn't want to throw it out the window due to my anger issues.
B008B11R2A|5.0|The key here is subtlety and minimalism, music that reveals itself over time. If you want to be beaten over the head with the exact emotion you're supposed to feel, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I'm a little taken aback by the criticism's to this album. No one expected The xx to reinvent their sound, and nor should they. They've found a sound the do exceptionally well and have perfected the sparse, anxious, yet far from hollow music they delivered on their first album.

B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I have read all the reachers, and this one was the most dissapointing.  It is thin on plot and short on imagination.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong, it is still a reacher, but not a good reacher.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This was an okay read.  The story line is very predictable.  While it was a good story, there was nothing to grab the readers attention and make you want to keep reading.  If you want an easy read with a good story this would be a good book, but don't expect anything spectacular.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was such a good book.  I was pulled in from the first page.  The author's detailed summary of her journey made you feel like you were right there with her.  She is an amazing woman with an amazing story to tell.  I recommend this to everyone, especially those who have gone through a loss of a loved one in their life.
0307887448|5.0|Let me just say: holy crap I loved this book. I listened to the audio version, and while it took me a little while to get used to Wil Wheaton's flow, I can't imagine anyone else narrating it. I may be a bit young to get all the references, but to anyone who grew up in the 80's and 90's, this story is a nostalgic romp through the pop culture of your childhood. All while taking place in a dystopic future.<br /><br />It's a future where trailer parks are now built in stacks and a majority of commerce and life are conducted in the OASIS, an advanced, Second-Life like virtual reality. When the creator of OASIS, James Halliday, dies, he sets in motion an OASIS-wide Easter egg hunt, a quest to inherit Halliday's empire.<br /><br />The clues are hidden in Halliday's past, and so millions of people delve into the culture of the 1980's. It's years before the first clue is broken, and Wade Watts, a poor, unremarkable high school student, is the one to do it.<br /><br />Wade's life changes irrevocably as he pursues the completion of the quest as he strives against both his friends and a corrupt corporation that will do whatever it takes (bombing, murder, fraud, bribery) to claim Halliday's legacy.<br /><br />Through his real-life quest for what he thinks is the ultimate treasure, Wade learns about the true meaning of friendship and what it means to live.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed the twists & turns.  Surprise ending! Fairly well written & keeps you engaged through out. A good legal thriller & one can definitely relate if you are a parent of a teenager!!
0345350499|5.0|I adore how Marion Zimmer Bradley managed to incorporate all the various myths of Morgainne, Merlin, and Arthur into one novel.  From Wales to Brittany the compilation of folklore shows the full effort of historical research of culture and diversity while developing the character's emotions to their changing world.  The first 50 pages do seem slow, and the ending feels a bit rushed, but there are hundreds of pages in between that had me nodding in agreement or pondering a perspective I had not thought of before.  I recommend every woman to read this novel.
0525953728|2.0|SPOILER ALERT ABOUT THE AUTHOR'S OPINION OF THE POTUS<br /><br />The Sixty Minute TV program interview of 'Mark Owen' convinced me that I had to have this book.  The model of the compound where Osama bin Laden lived!  The author's identity painstakingly altered! The detail!  The drama!  I wanted this book - well, along with millions of others.<br /><br />I read of the training, the camaraderie, the sheer guts that it takes to become a Navy SEAL.  The story was heroic, the telling intense.  The revelations of inside knowledge such as that SEAL'S don't go 'all Shock and Awe' when they go on a mission was fascinating.  Even the respectful listing of a memorial to the Navy SEALS lost in the line of duty gained my approval and admiration for the author. . .  And then - at the close of the book - the hero stumbled on his way off the stage.<br /><br />A character flaw, hidden among all that valor.  Owen couldn't help but throw mud on the President in his closing chapter:  The revelation that the members of the assassination team don't really like their Commander in Chief.  The author elevates himself while criticizing the President's lack of sincerity - even the color of  tie the President wore to the acknowledgement ceremony for the members of the mission is slurred by  the author.  Owen curiously includes a whine that the President didn't follow through on an invitation that the members of the mission come to 'the residence' for a beer\\"!  Owens is actually bitter about not being invited for a beer with a guy he so openly (a) dislikes and (b) disrespects?  This little glimpse into Owen's shallow intellect will go a lot farther in my mind than all the rest.<br /><br />It's best, indeed, that you be on your way now, 'Mark Owen'.
0345803507|2.0|i LIKED THE FIRST BOOK THEN THE SECOND ONE WAS MORE OF THE SAME WITH NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE AND THELAST BOOK WAS ALSO MORE OF THE FIRST AND SECOND. I WAS HOPING FOR MORE DETAIL OF cHRISTIANS LIFE BUT THAT REALLY NEVER HAPPENED.  QUITE DISAPPOINTED

B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Hollywood just keeps cranking out these lousy movies.  This one was a tad better then Battleship, which gets my vote for worst movie of the year.  This movie just never took off, never got really rolling.  It was a pathetic attempt to spin a classic story with Lord of the Rings, complete with dwarfs.  I was glad when it was finally over.  So glad it will be going back to video store.  Don't waste your time on this.  Really aching for a solid movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this rocks it works perfectly. but one thing why cant it be day and night on creative and have beds on survival.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|This was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I've ever seen. But this release gets 2 stars in my book because the LACK of any kind of meaningful special features. No 'making of' featurette, which is damn near standard in ANY release as HUGE as this one, and the other offerings are anemic at best. If they end up adding more extras to a later release to try go get me to buy yet ANOTHER 'Avengers' DVD, as did the constantly re-released with yet ANOTHER special feature 'Lord of the Rings', they will be sadly disappointed. I'm sick of studios using this kind of tactic to squeeze the possible last nickel out of consumers. And this feels like just this kind of setup.<br /><br />A sad offering here.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Great movie. Interesting story line with lots of twists and turns. Great cast. I agree with the other posts, read little about the ,movie and avoid spoilers.
0765367351|5.0|This is an enjoyable read.  I could hardly put it down. If you loved the game, you MUST read this!
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I really enjoy this album.  The music is so unique and powerful.  Great purchase.  there are very few albums that inspire and move me as much as his music.  give it a try!
0345803485|1.0|...and I find it hard to believe that anyone actually paid for this book.  Those opening pages were some of the worst-written I've ever read.  I had not read any reviews before that, but I see now that I was not wrong in my assessment.  Why do people encourage such mediocrity?  Less than mediocre, really.  How do you justify handing over your hard-earned money to someone who can't write but has obviously mastered the art of \\"fooling most of the people most of the time?\\"  Why has the news media latched onto this so assiduously?  The emperor truly has no clothes.
0525953728|5.0|Finished in a day. Mr. Mark Owen's book has been a great read. Will recommend to others patriots. Page #141 \\"Were you abused\\" had put us at a boil... Washington D.C. politicians are not their friends ...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!!! everytime I start I cant stop. its so much fun. its a great challenge for anyone who is up for one. each level different makes it extra fun!! I cant stop!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is up on a level by itself.  Put your thinking caps on bec you're going to need them. This is a very sophisticated game - first you try to get all the pearls, then if you didn't manage to do it in the least number of moves possible, which are posted, you try an even more difficult challenge and try to do it in less moves (as if getting through the puzzle wasn't hard enough).  It plays beautiful music during the game and it's very peaceful while you think.  There are no words, no numbers, just lovely layouts.  Beautiful formats.  Best game for real thinkers.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is similar to [[ASIN:B0068TL23G Router]] and [[ASIN:B006THXYK6 Router Aqua]] (both very good apps with free versions), but with this game you need to cover all the squares on the board to pass each level. The first forty levels are pretty easy, but the 7x7 board starts getting difficult. Over 600 levels -- from 5x5 boards to 14x14 boards in four separate \\"level packs\\" available on Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The interface is better that Router because you can remove \\"pipes\\" at any time, in any sequence. And for the colorblind, or just for more clarity, you can use the settings to turn \\"flow labels: on\\". This adds alphabet letters to each node point so it's obvious which two points need to be connected. Very reliable software, and Noodlecake also makes more popular games like [[ASIN:B0077SGMXM Super Stickman Golf]], [[ASIN:B008458O3S Trainyard]] and the free game [[ASIN:B008BK5HJK Foozle]].
B00881VLCE|5.0|not too easy, not too hard. I liked the choice of the piece size to add difficulty. the pictures were cool too!

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I borrowed World War Z from a friend and couldn't put it down. I gave it back two days later... but at first I had pooh-poohed as trashy pulp. Every where I looked it seemed like another zombie book was in the book store window. As I read it though, I found myself not only enjoying the interview narrative but the attention to detail. Brooks mentions a few places I've visited personally and I found his research to be pretty good. Further, his hints at catastrophes that he doesn't get into in the story itself kept me reading, hoping to find out more as to what happened in Buenos Aires or China Camp for example.<br /><br />I picked it up again three days, at a loss for a fast fun good read, and found myself just as eager to finish it all in one sitting as I when I read it the first time. I'm not a zombie or an apocalypse fanboy... I am a fan though of decent writing, compelling narratives, and stories of how humans seem to be at the center of most system failures. World War Z is all of the above.<br /><br />I was so disappointed with the movie... the book is SO much better.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have been and continue to be vocal in my defense of  \\"John Carter,\\" which I gladly point to as THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR. (Sorry, Avengers.) For me the bottom line is the power of the film itself - the effect it had on me and on others as individual audience members - rather than the beliefs of those who can't look beyond profit margins or the ignorance of pinhead reviewers who believe that a movie based on a 100-year-old novel is somehow derivative of all these books, comics, TV shows and movies that came along later.<br /><br />Based on the outpouring of love the film has received from its fans, \\"John Carter\\" can be only seen as a success. A qualified success, perhaps, but a success all the same. And all the finger-wagging and naysaying and lengthy lectures about Hollywood economics does not change that fact one little iota.<br /><br />Leave to a Thark his head and one hand and he may yet prevail. The same is true for fans of \\"John Carter,\\" who will eventually be able to look back and say \\"We told you so!\\"<br /><br />I'm not saying \\"John Carter\\" will one day be as revered as such films as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" or \\"Star Wars,\\" although in my opinion it should be. But it's MUCH better than the naysayers and the bean counters would have you believe. And it WILL stand the test of time.

B0084I9QI2|1.0|I just purchased Michael Jackson's 25th Annversary Edition release of his Bad Tour at Wembley Stadium DVD and feel very let down by his estate in the simple fact that they havent done him justice, yet again. I am a huge Michael Jackson fan and have been for 20 years and am considering starting a petition to get the Bad tour released in a better format, possibly on Bluray just like the film Moonwalker was release on Bluray. There is such a huge demand and large market for Michael Jackson Live performance footage to be released that it would be such a huge hit in sales and satifaction for music lovers worldwide. The black market is secetly booming with homemade Live DVD's of Michael. The Bad tour is Michael at his best and should be celebrated in a much better style than this feeble release. I understand this recording was taken from vhs (the footage taken from the large audience screen feeds) which explains its quality. Michael never released his live concet footage to the commercial market for reasons unknown but if he had of done it would be a, if not the biggest sales he would have achieved in the history of his entertaining career. He wouldn't be happy with such a poor quality version of his performance being released. It's like his artwork as he used to call it. It's lik putting cling-film over a magnificent painting so you can't see its details. I know from many many other fans there is huge dissapointment from around the world from Michaels fan base. Also it is such a shame for us fans, the one's that weren't at the concert to not experience the concert like 'you were there at the time' which i feel high definition would do to the footage, enhancing the experience incredibly. Imagine the response from releasing a high definition version of Michael Jackson Live. There must be better footage available, as proven by uploads and previouse official Michael Jackson DVD releases. PLEASE release it in high definition, it is such an opportunity not to be missed.
B0093ICOJ0|4.0|Managed to preview this latest installment of the Batman animated features prior to its official DVD release, and again we find a story based on a classic DC graphic novel... yet not just any graphic novel, but the one which was the first step in breathing fresh new life into the Batman franchise when the character and his surrounding mythology were hemorrhaging and trying to remain relevant for a new generation of comic book fans as well as for American moviegoers whose only experience with the Batman was a campy television show from the 1960s.<br /><br />\\"THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS\\" translates the original DC graphic novel by Frank Miller over to the \\"animation\\" realm and does quite a successful job at remaining faithful to the original source material, which is certain to be a huge plus for the many hardcore \\"purists\\" who were enthralled with Miller's \\"non-continuity\\" imagination piece.<br /><br />However, this rendition of the story does (in my opinion) have two very serious flaws:<br /><br />The first flaw is the \\"artwork.\\" The drawn characters are not smooth, flowing and graceful, but rather rough, bulky and clumsy. Of course, this is supposed to be \\"deliberate\\" on the animators' part, as they are clearly attempting to mimic the pencil art style of Miller's original drawings... but what works well within the \\"printed pages\\" feels extremely awkward when making the transition to animated video. So while the story itself keeps us engrossed, the \\"visual\\" style always manages to keep us slightly off-kilter.<br /><br />The second and biggest flaw is the garsh-horrible Voice-Directing and Voice-Acting. Peter Weller (\\"ROBOCOP\\") supplying the voice for Bruce Wayne [slash] Batman does almost nothing to rescue the vocal performances! The way the voice actors deliver their lines of dialog are so nerve-gratingly amateurish that it sounds like a stage production being performed by any typical Junior-High School drama club. Even with the awkward & foreign colloquialisms of this \\"fantasy future world,\\" there's really no excuse for such wooden & stilted (and utterly \\"EXPRESSIONLESS\\") line delivery: it is as if this particular band of actors really did not care about their work, but were instead merely stepping up in front of a microphone for no other purpose than to draw a paycheck just so they could cover their next rent & utilities payments.<br /><br />These demerits aside however, the fact that the story and the very concept of The Batman \\"rising\\" out of retirement (if you'll pardon the pun) is enough to keep the viewer totally involved speaks well of it as a solid \\"package,\\" and DC is to be commended for finally bringing this top fave of fanboys everywhere to join the ranks of so many other impressive \\"DCAU\\" features, and it stokes the flames of anticipation for the as yet unreleased \\"Part 2\\" in this saga.\\"fantasy future world,\\" there's really no excuse for such wooden & stilted (and utterly \\"EXPRESSIONLESS\\") line delivery: it is as if this particular band of actors really did not care about their work, but were instead merely stepping up in front of a microphone for no other purpose than to draw a paycheck just so they could cover their next rent & utilities payments.<br /><br />These demerits aside however, the fact that the story and the very concept of The Batman \\"rising\\" out of retirement (if you'll pardon the pun) is enough to keep the viewer totally involved speaks well of it as a solid \\"package,\\" and DC is to be commended for finally bringing this top fave of fanboys everywhere to join the ranks of so many other impressive \\"DCAU\\" features, and it stokes the flames of anticipation for the as yet unreleased \\"Part 2\\" in this saga.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Everyone has heard about fifty shades by now. We kow its erotica...we knows it's a twilight fan fic that has been spruced up, changed around and published. The bad reviews have their good points, really. But let's be real here. Twilight was not the best written work ever put to page, so it should come to no surprise that this isn't written well either.<br /><br />As far as the unbelievability of the novel... It's an Erotic novel. It's written to make women dream and wish and want. No, it's not likely there's a 26 yr old billionaire (with the exception of mark zuckerberg) but come on, what woman wouldn't want Christian Grey? Yes, AS was a Bella by another name, completely. But stop expecting a dandelion to be a rose. It never pretended to be anything but a good old erotica with a dash of love.<br /><br />Go in with an open mind and try it out. Aside from the clash of British wording at times, it's really not THAT bad.
B008476HBM|5.0|There is nothing to say about \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that most readers don't already know. It is a brilliant novel from the pen of Jane Austen, and therefore should be read be every intelligent person. I already had a copy or two of the book, as well as countless film versions, but I needed a large print edition since I'm now old. And it's nice to be able to read the book without my glasses again. So if you're in your 40s and love this book, your home library or bedside table needs this large print edition of it.

I also have a [[ASIN:B000KKPN5C Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]], which is terrific, but I wanted something I could rotate to bounce off the wall, whereas the SB-400 was only for bouncing off the ceiling) or one wall if shooting the camera in portrait orientation.<br /><br />This recharges very quickly, has handfuls of power and I love that the filters it is delivered with communicate with the flash so that the camera can account for the color shift.<br /><br />I use mine with the orange filter attached most of the time.<br /><br />Soon I'll be using it with my D600 [[ASIN:B0099XGZXA Nikon D600 24.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)]] and I expect it to continue to offer excellent service.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Good game. simple and yet challenging. The game has great replay value, especially when you are always trying to beat your old score.
B004LROMWU|5.0|When I started watching Falling Skies, my first impression was that it was a bite off of Walking Dead, just replacing zombies with aliens.  But that doesnt mean it's not a good show.  I guess you could say both zombies and aliens have been done many times before, but I've always liked the subject of aliens.  I ended up enjoying this show very much, and will surely be getting the next season whenever it's released.  It started out slightly corny to me, but as the episodes went on, I was drawn into the story.  This show might get lost in between the likes of Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones and Spartacus, but I'd recommend checking it out.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I never had a Pinterest before I downloaded this, and I was really excited about getting one. I bought this app and tried to make an account, but it always froze... I had to restart my Kindle 3 times because it kept on freezing and crashing it! Ugh. Not buying this again.
0553284347|4.0|this book is a life saver, i had a lot of questions for the longest time and it really made me feel like they knew wht i was going thru, the reason i didnt give it 5 it was because it was an older print. but i recomended to anybody for friends or family a must have...

B007JM4CWY|4.0|The last update removed score loop rankings... Bummer.<br />Otherwise, the larger puzzles are very difficult on a phone, but perfect on tablets.<br />I wish you could bulk fill in squares and not just lines.<br />Save points would be a nice feature. The work around is to repeatedly mark a pixel, then try a guess. If that does not pan out, use the back button until you see that pixel flash. This is broken if you back out of the level.<br />Please keep on adding puzzles!
B0087HT36U|4.0|Good game. A lot like angry birds, but easier. Extra words to get my free level. More extra words for free
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this app huge fan of minecraft and the only thing is it wont let me use crafting table and other syuff like that but other than that its a great game jst needs to b a lil cheaper
0205313426|4.0|Great tips. A must buy for nerds. My mom enjoys it as well. Not as interesting as Twilight or Harry Potter, but more realistic.
B0054VVRBQ|3.0|Product fits flush into a MINI PCI express card slot.  However on Dell Studio 14 systems, You need to unplug and replug in the unit to be recognized.<br /><br />You can't leave the product plugged in between boots because it will not be recognized when the system boots up.  This is probably a Dell BIOS issue, but with the latest BIOS from Dell, the problem persists<br /><br />1.  Turn off system<br />2.  Plug in Unit<br />3.  Turn on system<br />4.

B007RTAR64|2.0|Warning, this doll is oozing glue out of her head, do not take hair out of ponytail, don't wash hair, don't let you child put head in mouth,if doll is in box exposed to heat head will stain box. This doll has a cheap Fashionista body, the cloths are great and head mold is nice, however the glue inside head consistently oozes. Defective doll....Mattel get your stuff together!!!
B007JUWM64|5.0|OMIGOSH. YES. YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES. Can I repeat that? I'm wanting to. I want to jump up and down and scream with delight...or go into crazy adrenaline mode like I did the other day when I walked out of the movie theater, my face covered in awe and wonder and true love and delight and amazement and pure inspiration and incredulity at this movie.<br /><br />I honestly have NOTHING bad to say about it. Not only was it extremely clean (besides a few hilariously placed cuss words and chest-showing damsels in distress), but it was just freaking phenomenally incredible. Do I make sense here? Is my brain befuddled and therefore befuddling you? I'm befuddled. This movie befuddles me. Hopefully you can make sense of this... ;)<br /><br />So what was there in this movie to look forward to, to love?<br /><br />First off, great music. If you listen to the soundtrack, you'll understand. Paul Haslinger - look him up.<br /><br />The modern vibe. I wasn't sure if I was going to like that part of it, but I did. Man, oh man.<br /><br />Then there was the cast. Ohhhhhh!! Whoever did the casting is a genius. These actors/actresses were perfect for their roles. I don't remember if there was once a line uttered wrong for the scene. Nothing about the actors and their talents was cheesy. Even actors (coughOrlandoBloomcough) who I've never appreciated the acting of were perfect for their parts and said everything perfectly and did everything perfectly. Was it the director or something? Dang, these guys nailed it.<br /><br />The filming was beautiful, as was the editing and CG. Oh man I want to live some of those scenes just because of the color and the way everything was so lifelike...and yet not.<br /><br />Then there were the costumes. HOLY SMOKES I wanted to wear every single dress in this movie; heck, I would have even tried on a man's outfit just for the sake of it. They were all extremely colorful and grand and beautifully detailed.<br /><br />They did all their own stunts. I mean, come on! Does it get better? Yes. Yes it does.<br /><br />Then, there was the dueling, the sword fights. It was like...art. Seriously, every move was like a hand-crafted porcelain from a master, perfectly placed and excellently choreographed, like a dance, or a poem.<br /><br />And the story line/characters. What the heck! It was fantastical. The story line was nonstop action and adventure. Every plot and subplot was carefully placed, every line written for a purpose and for the immense enjoyment of the movie-goer. I couldn't believe my eyes - everything was so intense, all the colors, all the action. Toward the end, I thought I was in the climax, but no, I wasn't. Things kept going wrong - and getting worse. I thought I was seeing the end, but then some other problem arose and was bigger than the last. The final blowout scene was satisfying and amazing. The best scene. WOW.<br /><br />And....I've been saving the best for last. Drum-roll please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />LOGAN LERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Ok, so I've had a thing for this guy since I saw \\"3:10 to Yuma\\", where he played with my all time favorite (Christian Bale) and nailed his role. In \\"Percy Jackson\\", he was the best thing about that movie (which sucked). And now, here, in this movie, he not only has a leading role, he has, what appeared to me, *the* leading role.<br /><br />Let me give you an example of how good Logan did at taking on his role. You know those characters, those who are new at whatever their task is, those who are very innocent an naïve and who do extremely embarrassing things that make the reader/watcher cringe in horror for him/her? Well, D'Artagnon could have been one of those characters. He did do some things that showed his naivety, but I never once cringed in painful embarrassment. I laughed. Heartily. Because the things he did were funny, and lessons learned. And even if the girl didn't fall for his flirty charms, I DID. Like, from the moment he opened hismouth. From the moment he whipped out that beautiful sword and fought off like twenty men before he received help.<br /><br />How did he do it? I ask myself. He perfected his role, made for laughter and entertainment, as well as a character who you could respect even while he is learning. That is what I call fantabulous acting. I hope he becomes one of the greats. :D<br /><br />And those are the reasons why this movie gets a 10/10 from me!! :D (And why you should somehow go see this movie right now!!!)mouth.

1439152799|4.0|This is the second of Kate Morton's book that I have read, the first being THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN.  Ms. Morton definitely has a lyrical way of writing and, as an author myself, I have often stopped in the middle of a sentence she has written, just to re-read it several times.  This woman is definitely gifted and knows exactly how to create a good book.<br /><br />I was amazed to see that she is Australian as her books definitely have a wonderful British flavor, which is what made me read them in the first place (I am English).<br /><br />No need to give you a summary of the plot.  If you like stories that span many years, have wonderful descriptive passages, and culminate in a satisfying ending - this is the book and the author for you.  For those who complain that the book \\"lags\\", I would suspect they may have an attention span problem.  The detail given these books is amazingly well done and Ms. Morton is to be complimented.  She is turning into one of my favorite authors and I highly recommend the above-mentioned twop books.  THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON is next on my list!<br /><br />Valerie Byron author of NO ORDINARY WOMAN
B007TNS6JI|2.0|This is a really fun hack and slash game.  The major problem I have is that it keeps randomly deleting my characters that I spend time building up.
B0090EIC3Y|5.0|This was so unexpectedly brilliant and well done! More than just a slapstick comedic satire. A current event satire with an unlikely, but touching, love story woven in. Not exactly a kid or date movie, but certainly one that will have you blowing beer out your nose. Not Politically Correct, by any means, but did you really expect it to be? No boring segments. Very little predictability. A Must See, unless you are easily offended. (WARNING: Large <gigantic> breasts and little goats involved)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought it was a typical story but it twisted!  A good read and I would recommend to my friends.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I need to take more time to get to know all of the features, but so far so good. I like it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I was looking for the generic Facebook app, and this app seems to be exactly that.  I haven't found any surprises yet, and that's a good thing.  I don't know why this didn't come pre-installed on the new Kindle Fire, or at least (as someone else mentioned) show up first in the search.
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|Some called this book a gothic romance but it is so much more. You get immersed in the unfolding drama and complexity of characters and your feelings towards them.....or because they may represent some part of you.
B000SJ9N1K|4.0|I bought this Album for my son for his birthday.  I ordered it late, only a couple of days before and never thought it would have arrived before his birthday a week or so earlier than promised.  Thank-you for the great service and and for the great description of the album.  It was in great shape and arrived nicely packaged.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the different things to do on this kind of game there is so many things to keep up on.
B007LB2B3K|2.0|Look, I'm glad the kids today have something to listen to that isn't lady gaga...but Volbeat needs to be clarified as its own genre. It's emo-metal. If Death Cab for Cutie decided to write for European goth metal weenies, this is the album they'd write.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise for me, and I would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of this genre. I was so caught up in this book that it was difficult for me to put down and it keeps the thrills and anticipation going throughout the story. It is not the epic fantasy with an extremely thought out world that some of the other books offer today, but makes up for any shortcomings in this area with the in depth and interesting characters that you come in contact with throughout the story.<br /><br />This book is a coming of age story told by the main character looking back at his own past, and as he tells his tale he also slowly begins to develop a new outlook on his current life. The story is well written and descriptive, the magic system for this book is nothing really new, but is interesting and explained well. The story also contains a romantic relationship that carries through the story and adds a nice extra element to the book.<br /><br />I have thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone that wants a good read. I will certainly also continue to read the rest of the series.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app is slow and really sucks its ok for downlaoding but it sucks. it sucks so bad that it ducks.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|While I'm not very computer savey I do like to futz around.  Picked this because of reviews and I<br />like the match 3 games. Easy to figure out and looks great on my Fire.  Can't wait to see it on my 8.9 inch Fire!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It works great it wakes me up every morning and it is never late. I never have to do anything to work it just turn it on once it does it for u whenever u need or whenever you push the button to turn it on.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|This movie is fantastic. I was in high school when it came out. The song \\"Time of My Life\\" was all over the radio. I guess I was too poor to go see it in a theatre. Well, this movie did not disappoint. It is movie magic. My expectations were pretty high and that usually spells trouble.<br /><br />QUALITY OF BLU RAY: The crispness of the film was not there in this 20 Year Anniversary Edition. In some of the dark dancing scenes the faces appeared grainy and there was a funky purple color. I'm not a techy. The sound quality was excellent. I could not tell the difference between this and my other Blu Ray discs.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun game, hurry up and make more levels please! I would like to see more and more levels from this game. I played it for hours!

B008Z9YGEE|3.0|It was good filming was good .I knew what was going to happen before it did . kinda took the fun out it .<br />I would watch it again tho when it comes on cable.

B0087HT36U|4.0|I am an angry bird junkie.  this one had me addicted. immediately.  in two days I am at the. Lawton level.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game might look boring but it is super cool. I'm considered smart but some of these are very challenging, I have been addicted I cant stop. (I'm not sure this is really a good thing) anyway, just GET the game!
0811806405|5.0|This book is very detailed and informative.  Even for being as old as it is I think most of the techniques still apply today, especially in a hand tool oriented shop.  I like doing most of my work with hand tools so this book was right up my alley.  I would highly reccomend it to anyone just starting out.  There just isn't many acoustic guitar making resources out there as good as this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So fun!  I love all the different catagories to choose from and share some of my own favorite things!  try it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great product and this app lets me access it seamlessly on my Kindle Fire. And it was free!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I really like this app.  Hope they keep bringing more like this.  So nice to have the different levels.  You can work up to a higher level with practice which makes it nice for all ages.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good suspense produced by numerous plot twists. Develops Jack Reacher's charater and strengths. Skillfully operates on the far edge of reality.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am in love with Christian and Anastasia.<br />In addition, makes you think twice how your sex life is LOL
B002PEP4SC|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Castle the TV show.  I own most of the seasons, watch the rest whenever I can and generally enjoy anything that Nathan Fillion turns his hand to, so when I had a long flight ahead of me a few weeks ago I happily picked up Heat Wave hoping for something that was as clever and engaging as their 45 minute mysteries.<br /><br />Unfortunately Heat Wave is not that book.  A short work, Heat Wave feels like a piece of fan fiction that was rushed out the door in order to meet someone's publication deadline.  The characters are direct lifts from the TV show without a real effort at development in any direction.  The mystery is simple and rather direct, it runs on rails until the inevitable conclusion, and the author puts in minimal twists and turns.  It's a story that would, in fact, work well for a 45 minute scripted show.  For a full length novel the bar is set higher however, and the simple process of evidence-suspect-alibi-repeat until the resolution isn't enough for a satisfying story.<br /><br />I'd like to hope that the other books in the Nikki Heat series improve on this.  Maybe once they realized this was going to be more than a one off cash grab they invested real time and resources into making the books worthwhile.  I will not be spending any more money to find out however.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am in love with Christian and Anastasia.<br />In addition, makes you think twice how your sex life is LOL
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Wow how time flies, almost had me tear up at then end of crusade when they ride off into the sunset. As for the quality there's only two scenes in the first 3 movies where for some reason the picture gets blurry, and it's not just my copy. When Indy and his helper have spiders on their backs, and when Indy sala and indys dad are in a car, does the same thing perfect picture then blurs. As for each picture quality it gets better for each movie, Venice looked beautiful. They still never fixed the audio bite in temple of doom when their floating in the raft and Winnie is saying she hates this and that and when the word you gets yelled out its a guys voice, indys mouth is shut, another funny thing I just noticed is when their on the blimp. Connery has the newspaper in his hand reading it upside down the entire scene lol just some funny little things oh and u can still see the glass seperation when Marion falls in front of the cobra, u can see the reflection.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book has reignited a flame for reading within me! The detail and emotion I saw and felt were incredible! Fantastic read!
B00899DR40|4.0|Its a pretty good CD. There's probably 3 songs on the entire CD that I don't like (i.e. Beauty and the Beast) but for the most part, I'm diggin this new and older Justin Bieber.
0765365278|5.0|I'm new to Sanderson's work... new in that a year ago I had not heard of him. In the last year I've read his Mistborn series and Alantris. The Way of Kings is yet another fantastic book by this wonderful author.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I still haven't figured out how my 2 year old has solved some of the levels but she has. I enjoy it so far
B004UID2LC|2.0|10/01/12 I just did a search on Paul Simon.  It will not even let me play anything new or old.  Look just take the freakin' download part off and at least let us play the video. Yes I've got a kindle fire and the coolest part was being able to download and play from non wifi areas. sucks. it would still be nice to just be able to play the vids through the freakin youtube app. this is just wrong. and I tried the fix. Uninstall and redownload. dont work still.
B0084I9QLY|5.0|Compare to Thriller it's a close second. The funk of this music is eye-popping good. I really like that it still holds up to current music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!  I post lots of things I like and see what other people like.  Great app!  Highly recommend!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Been playing everyday....cant seem to put the game down.....play until my battery dies.....hope to get a new leave....do I can keep playing
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|This movie is awesome. i thought it was very funny. i have not seen the tv show. i didn't even know it was based on a tv show now i gotta watch the show. i hope the show is as good as the movie. i loved jonha hill and channing tattum's characters they were hillarious. those two make a good team hope they make more movies together. i loved the story and the actors. this was a awesome movie. if you have not seen this movie then recommend you do
B0089ZEEYG|1.0|This game looks cute and fun to play but it will not download on my kindle fire at all. It starts to then stops. It got to the end but would not install. Ah well. :(
B005LAII62|5.0|This movie was pretty good. i enjoyed it very much. i thought that norman was a great character and so was neil. i loved the zombies. they made the movie funny. but i do agree that they should of left out some of the adult stuff like the grandmother saying jackass, and neils brother announcing he was gay. and they could of left out alot of the butt scense two. this is a kids movie. it was still pretty good i liked it alot. i thought that the story was excellent and awesome. this is a movie that you don't want to take a 5-9 year old to see. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do.
B002JIBA8W|5.0|friday night lights is a great show. set in everday america,  it shows what true life is like for some small towns. we like the fact that things are not blown out of proportion. just a really good show, a must watch
1469984202|5.0|It has been a while since I read a sci-fi book. This one kept me up until late in the evening. If you are only going to read one sci-fi novel this year, this is your book.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|I normally don't read these types of fantasy books, nor do I write reviews, but this book is GREAT. The story was a true adventure saga, that brought reality to the world of Guild Wars - all while giving a crash-course in the history of the world (Tyria). If you enjoy the game and would like to know more about the lore, this is definitely a must-read along with the Edge of Destiny.<br /><br />Ghosts of Ascalon is better for a brief introduction to the current state and recent history of Tyria. The battles actually play out similar to playing Guild Wars 2, which makes both the book and the game more enjoyable. I know that sounds weird, but it's true. The Edge of Destiny is the story you follow in the game, and should be read after this (which in turn should be followed by playing Guild Wars 2 to find out what happens next/explore the world you read!)<br /><br />Five stars, best book I've read in awhile.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It was OK, but maybe the problem was that it didn't look or feel like the previous version of Mahjong I had been using and enjoying.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Once again, Aimee Mann delivers an album full of incredible lyrics woven perfectly into infectious melodies. Mann's voice remains one of the most hauntingly beautiful anywhere, and while a few tracks may not make you hit the Repeat button instantly, many will. The album is easy to embrace, a treat to experience, and another reminder of how good music is truly crafted. New Mann listeners: start with Charmer, Labrador, and Crazy Town.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game seems to work fine.  It has some new and useful automatic moves.  Other than that, it's just solitaire.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Rent it, you won't be sorry, action packed, and best of all it's within the doctrine of being believable too.
B003PIS5XI|3.0|I had not viewed this movie in a long time and remembered it has being better. It is an ok movie-nostalgic and cute.
B0089ZEEYG|4.0|Yes it seems repetitive, and is in a way, but when you get past the first few levels it gets more and more difficult to avoid the obstacles, steadily increasing the challenge.<br /><br />Your mission is to eat as many donuts, cakes and pies as you can while avoiding the various obstacles coming your way. I don't know how many levels there are but if you look at the achievements there seems to be quite a few. I've only gotten as far as the fourth level so far. You get 10 lives, and lose one each time you are hit. You can gain them back by eating the velentine candy box. Once your lives are used up game is over and you start again, trying to beat your score and get to higher levels. It does keep your score and achievements.<br /><br />There seems to be some confusion as this is offered by End Games and the fake reviews are also from people giving fake reviews for other End Games apps.<br />Down The Hatch is actually created by Nom Productions so I don't think they are responsible for the fake reviews. As for IAP I didn't see any. Clicking the news link gives you a message which reads-<br /><br />\\"Welcome Amazon Users! Thanks for downloading and playing down the Hatch.\\" There are right and left arrows but they don't do anything.<br /><br />Clicking the Nom Productions icon takes you to their blog. It looks like they only have two games, this one and Nomsters which I don't think is available yet. They are working on a third. I saw no place to purchase any of these games on the blog, however there is a post saying Down The Hatch was featured on GooglePlay and clicking that takes you to GooglePlay home page, not this game. There is also a link bringing you to the Amazon FAOTD.<br /><br />I think children and adults can enjoy this game. Although young children probably won't get past the first level. It's just a shame Nom Productions chose End Games, which is notorious for fake reviews, as their distributor.<br /><br />It works great on my K Fire. I like it but don't loveit. A solid four stars.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|I love Sex and the City series very much. But the director and  the screenwriter seemed lost in this film. It's more like a advertisement of the luxury hotel and vacation destination. The story is poor and the performance is dramatic. It's a bad tail to a pig.
0465011047|5.0|This story comes off as being quite authentic. The author tells the majority of the story from the first person point of view. There are obvious things which he didn't witness such as his family's history prior to their move from Japan to North Korea, but these are only for background information. Everything about this book reveals how desensitized Kang became due to his upbringing, at least while he was in the camp. He explains how he was able to adapt and overcome. He pointed out how undevoted to the cause the security agents in the camp were, the soldiers, and other various officials in the North Korea government. Regardless, all people lived in fear of either their superiors, their friends who were often snitches, and their minders. Kang also displays the complete and total breakdown of the North's distribution and rationing system, the birth of an illicit market economy and the rampant corruption in the Stalinist-type system. When Kang speaks as a witness of camp 15, and says there are certainly much worse camps, it is terrifying to know that people at this very moment are still enduring what he and his family endured. Kang must feel some ambivalence towards his decision to flee the country after being released, as his family and particularly his sister have allegedly been sent back. It is very possible that his sister was condemned to the section of the prison for the un-redeemables, in other words, those who are sentenced to work to death on secret government programs. The worst part about the entire system is that guilt by association (which really was the reason his family was put away in the first place), is the norm. His entire family was put away for their grandfather's alleged political crimes. Nobody knows what happened to him. Hopefully Kang's story will have an effect for the good, and Kim Jong-un will be able to make much needed market reforms. Even if NK reaches the point of China, things will have improved one hundred fold.
0525952926|5.0|I'd like to begin by saying why I was able to read and write a review of a 925 page book on the day of its release. I preordered this book a couple of months ago, when the release date was Sep 11th. I was sent the book, received it on Sep 12th and spent a few days reading it. When I went to Amazon to post my review, I found the release date had been moved back to Sep 18th and that I couldn't post my review. So, here it is now! I'm rather curious how many other readers also received their book a week early?<br /><br />Anyway, my review...<br />Ken Follett's new novel, \\"Winter of the World\\", is the second in the planned three volume set about the history of the 20th century. Beginning in 1933, Follett brings his huge cast of characters along from the years up to the end of the Great War. To talk about the plot of the new book is impossible. Way too many characters and too many plot points. BUT, Follett's such a good writer that he brings the reader up to date with ALL his characters. Follett gives most of his characters enough nuance that few seem like caricatures.<br /><br />The interesting thing about Follett's second book is the breadth of the coverage of the 1930's and 40's (and into the `50's).  Everything from the burning of the Reichstag to the T4 Euthanesia program under the Nazis, to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the battle of Midway to the development of the atomic bomb is covered. Now, in a regular novel, the reader would think, \\"oh yeah, how can one character or family of characters be present at all these historic events?\\" But Follett has developed so many characters that what happens is not unlikely. His characters seem to merge with each other and then separate much like the designs in a kaleidoscope. The American heiress from the Russian-emigree father goes to England in the mid-1930's and marries the son(s) of members the British/Welsh nobility. The German characters interact with both the British and the Russians. All these families had been introduced in Follett's first book and all interacted in Follett's second.<br /><br />Something else interesting I noticed from Follett's first book and his second is the fact that none of the major characters in the first book died. They had to survive to make the second book possible. Now in the second book, several of the main characters do die, which, given the war setting, is a bit more believable. However, many children are also born by book's end and these children will star in the third book in the Follett trilogy.<br /><br />Also, and this is important. Follett doesn't do a lot of reintroducing characters, their relationships, and plot points from the first book to the second. I guess he just assumes most readers have read the first book and so know the characters of the second. As a result, there's little awkwardness to his writing and the second book flows pretty naturally.<br /><br />A question a new reader might ask is if he should read the first book,\\"Fall of the Giants\\" before \\"Winter of the World\\"? This second book could be a stand-alone novel. Follett sets an ambitious course with his proposed three volume set. So far, with the first and second books, he's done quite well.<br /><br />I don't normally write such short reviews but there's no way to talk about the plot except to say Follett is a master. And if you don't like the book, you can always use it as a door stop. It is a large volume, containing a great story. Enjoy.uced in Follett's first book and all interacted in Follett's second.<br /><br />Something else interesting I noticed from Follett's first book and his second is the fact that none of the major characters in the first book died.

B005FMB8X6|5.0|If you've heard any of the other 40th Anniversary resissues, you know what a difference there is between these new mixes/masters (taken from the original tapes, transferred lovingly into digital under the supervision of Mr. Bob), and the originals (which were who-knows-how-many generations removed from the studio master by the time it hit the pressing plant). This is no exception, and if you dig 80s Crim, this is an essential release.<br /><br />If you haven't heard any of these, i say this with no hyperbole: It's like the difference between standard tv and high-def. It REALLY is. This is the record presented with all the detail and power the band intended, and it SLAYS. \\"Indiscipline\\" crushes in a way the original release doesn't. The tension and interplay between the frantic guitar riffage and steady rhythm section on \\"Frame By Frame\\" is even more engrossing.<br /><br />All this without deviating from or changing the balance/feel/tone of the originals. Don't think \\"colorized b&w movie\\"; Think \\"newly developed and processed from the original negative\\".<br /><br />I've said this about all the reissues, and I'll say it about this one: It is probably THE version to own.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|So this one's pretty much a no-brainer.  You've got Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America all in the same movie.  Really, nothing else needs to be said.  That should be enough to make you want to watch this movie.<br /><br />In all seriousness though, this may be the most perfect blend of action and comedy I've ever seen in a movie.  So many hilarious, quotable one-liners.  So many eye-popping moments that make you raise devil horns and make you say, \\"Yes!\\"  Black Widow is one of the most badass chicks I've ever seen in a movie, I'd like to see her in her own quite frankly.  And as much as I love the others, I gotta say Hulk steals the show.  There's this one scene with him and Loki...dude, if you've seen the movie, you know which one I'm talking about.  The only weak link in my opinion is Hawkeye.  He's got some cool moments of his own, but he's still \\"the guy that shoots arrow.\\"<br /><br />Oh yeah, and did I mention Robert Downey Jr.'s in it?<br /><br />Honestly, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you owe it to yourself to do so.  A cynic might look at all the money and popularity and assume this is just a hype machine.  But really, the hype is deserved.  This isn't just a movie, it's a culture phenomenon.  I predict people are still gonna be quoting this movie decades from now.  I'm sure there's plenty of people out there fighting over, \\"Which one's better?  The Avengers or Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy?\\"  I'm not gonna get into all that, I'm just gonna count myself lucky to live in a time when there's so many great superhero movies coming out.  The last time I saw a movie this good...The Dark Knight.  So yeah, go ahead and see it.  Personally, I can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />\\"It's Superman!!!\\" - some kid behind me during Captain America's first in-costume appearance

B0041KKYBA|4.0|Very well presented recap of the 2008 financial collapse starting with the meltdown in Iceland.  Charles Ferguson knows how to put together the pieces but he should have given his subjects more room to talk.  It would have been interesting to see some of the persons involved in the crisis be more open in their comments.  Instead, Ferguson edits his interviews to get the desired results, not much unlike Michael Moore.<br /><br />Ferguson spreads the blame around, charting the banking deregulations back to the Reagan administration and the Saving and Loans debacle of the mid-80s.  Seems we never learn our lessons.  Instead, we just up the ante, which became astronomical in the 90s and first decade of 2000. Here was little old Iceland wanting to be a player, deregulating its well-guarded banking industry and watching the bottom fall out of its little real estate boom, with the culprits free to hide abroad.  Of course, the scale of the Wall St. collapse was much, much larger and reverberated around the world, but we should have seen it coming, which is exactly what Ferguson points out by referencing books like [[ASIN:B002CMLQVQ The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash]] and interviewing Charles Morris.<br /><br />Morris, like many other business writers saw it coming, but no one was taking note at the time.  The problem is that many of the same figures who played conspicuous roles in the meltdown have been part of the reconstruction team, like Larry Summers, which makes you wonder if anything is really being done to clean up the mess.
B001CY5MYC|3.0|I love Julia Roberts so I enjoyed this movie.  But the plot is simple bordering on senseless.  Roberts plays a university instructor who moves from California to teach at a prestigious women's college on the east coast. The year is 1953, and her students, despite their many talents and above average intelligence, are more concerned about getting married and having a family and getting dinner on the table by 5 pm than anything else. Roberts thinks they should put their careers first. This attitude is explained by saying that Roberts is \\"from California,\\" as if in 1953 women in California were feminists. California didn't become the hot seat of a new way of thinking until the hippie revolution in the late 60s.  Nor did women who went to prestigious universities in the 1950s have such little regard for a career. The head of the university is portrayed as some backward thinking foil for Roberts' progressive views, when in reality the heads of prestigious womens' universities were very progressive for their times.  So it's all kind of silly and the plot hardly  holds together. The significance of the title, \\"Mona Lisa Smile,\\" is never explained. Still, if you like Roberts, and I do, you'll probably enjoy the film anyway. Just leave your brain behind when you sit down to watch it and enjoy.

I was hooked, along with my 71 yr old mother! lol! The storyline and characters are engageing and impossible to turn off. Thanks AMC, now my DVR will never have room!

034552554X|5.0|THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS is Vanessa Diffenbaugh's debut novel.  It opens with 18-year old, Victoria Jones striking out on her own after a lifetime of living in the foster home system.  The angry and distrustful former ward of the state had only one opportunity at being adopted which failed when she was ten.  For most of her eighteen years, she has bounced around group homes.  Victoria has been hurt to the breaking point and believes she's flawed beyond anyone's love.<br /><br />At 18, it's an interesting juxtaposition that Victoria finds herself homeless, sleeping in parks and working odd jobs.  It's at this point she taps into memories of her childhood when she briefly lived with former-mother, Elizabeth and learned about the Victorian-era language of flowers, which now helps her get a job at a flower shop.<br /><br />\\"Now, as an adult, my hopes for the future were simple: I wanted to be alone, and to be surrounded by flowers.  It seemed, finally, that I might get exactly what I wanted\\".<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS is about coming to terms with the past and moving toward the future - even when a chance discovery shakes her fragile sense of identity and threatens to destroy the little she's accomplished.<br /><br />Vanessa Diffenbaugh, herself a foster mother, clearly knows both the human heart and plants and she keeps us cheering for Victoria who eventually comes to understand that \\"the unattached, the unwanted, the unloved, could grow to give love as lushly as anyone else.\\"<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS is written with a touch of magical realism.  It's like reading a whimsical fairytale bouquet of relationships between mothers, daughters, friends and lovers.  I simply could not put it down.  In the language of flowers, camellia means my destiny in is your hands.  Vanessa Diffenbaugh has created the Camellia Network in order to create a nationwide movement to support youth making the transition from foster care to independence.  You can get more information at [...] or can contact Vanessa at her Facebook page.<br /><br />I simply can't wait for her next novel.<br /><br />(this review first appeared at [...])er Facebook page.

0143118757|5.0|It is like a new one. No underlines and highlights are shown in the book. I am satified with this book. Next time, I will use this used book ordering system.
B008AS5UAO|5.0|I received this today and just listened to it.  The orchestra is good and is well recorded.........the bass level is nice and gives the sub woofer a pretty good workout.  The tempi are good; however, at times I thought it to be a hair slow for my taste...but that is a very small quibble.<br /><br />I own many recordings and DVD's of this opera and without a doubt Donna Elvira and Donna Anna are sung better on this than any recording I own and any live performance I have seen.  DiDonato absolutely owns the role of Donna Elvira on this recording:  her range, her emotional intensity, and her ennunciation are breathtaking....so many singers come off as a comic buffoon when they sing this role because of its extreme difficulty; however, Miss DiDonato is as perfect as even Mozart could have hoped.<br /><br />Equally impressive is Damrau's Donna Anna ............... The real test of any Donna Anna singer is how well she handles Don Ottavio, son morta! and the subsequent aria Or sai chi l'onre.................and believe me Damrau explodes with a barely controlled rage that sent chills down my spine.  This is why I love opera!!<br /><br />The rest of the cast are good and aquit themselves well.  Five stars and highest recommendation for Damrau and DiDonato
B007EC6FIS|2.0|But it's really not Night Train or Perfect Symmetry.  Thank God!  Those last two albums were absolutely unbearable.  Keane is moving away from 80s synth-pop music and forward into modern music again.  If you loved Hoped and Fears, as well as Under the Iron Sea, Strangeland is indeed aptly titled.  Strangeland doesn't have the raw emotion and soaring vocals of the first two albums.  And, thankfully, it doesn't have all the goofy 80s and 90s pop music of the two albums directly prior to Strangeland.  If you're like me, and you wonder \\"What in the heck happened to Keane?!\\", this album doesn't redeem them entirely, but it does make progress.  I give this album a 2-star solid \\"meh\\".  It's not bad, though there's nothing in it that would qualify it as good.  It's barely bearable.  Lyric are boring, vocals are not as gripping, the music doesn't have the force of raw emotion, but no clap machines!  See?  Progress, I told ya.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|this book did not have a captivating story line to keep a reader interested past the sexual appetites of the Grey character.  Way to easy to figure it out.  Not a good read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Even after considering the several thousand one star reviews I was intrigued however, the one thing keeping me from even trying this series is the price. Come on, virtually $10 for an electronic book?! What you have to pay you booky back?

B002UD56I6|3.0|the selected product is required, but definitely lacking in details such as a booklet to enjoy the maximum value of the object.<br />as a whole is positive.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Winter of the World is an excellent successor to Fall of Giants. It is gripping and believable. It makes you wonder how you would have acted when history is happening around you and choices have to be made without the consequences known. My only wish is the book had been a bit longer, now with ebooks, I really don't care about the number of pages the book is.<br /><br />The model is the same as the first book. The great events of the 20th century pass by and the impact and role of people in Russia, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States is described and followed. The same families as in the first book star, but now the book is more about the children, though their parents do play a role. Many historical characters act in the side line.<br /><br />The book is fast-paced and takes you from the Reichstag fire to the Spanish Civil War, to the battle in Cable Street and then to various locations in the Second World War and the start of the cold war aftermath. It's not just history, there is plenty of love, laughter, loss, betrayal and a bit of sex here and there. Some of the plots of the previous book are carried on to this book. Not everyone gets the one they want and not every romance is a success. Specifically the illegitimate children of the first book that have varying roles to play in the new book and you constantly wonder about how their parentage will play a role.<br /><br />All in all what I love about the books is that it constantly makes me wonder how I would have reacted in certain cases. What if I had been a Russian, what if I had been a Welsh miner, a German social democrat. It's easy enough now that we know the winners and losers, but when the choices are made not much is known. I also love the historical and pieces of trivia. Like the start of the Marshall plan, whose impact reaches on to today as its successor is my employer.<br /><br />The only point of comment is that some of the plots could have been made a bit longer and some of the charactersare a bit too flat, because it seems the author was cut short by the editor. The children have to compete with the parents for pages and as a reader I want to know about both, which makes the children's stories shorter than the stories of their parents in the first book. Some characters become a bit flat as a result. But I can't wait for the third episode. I wonder whether the characters will be involved in the space programmes of their countries, how Vietnam, de-collonization and the Middle East will feature, or if the author will focus on something completely different.
0525953728|5.0|I read alot of books, I listen to Audible books on my commute. I know what I like and this book went over the top.<br />The story was excellent. Not me,me,me. He told a very solid story of his time from wishing he could be a Seal growing up, to the ultimate mission to cap his career.<br />This was told with him as part of a team. His contribution and his fellow teammates contribution to their unselfish job of<br />keeping us safe from dark side of this world.<br />After reading this book you can't help but be very thankful there are American men and women who deny self and dedicate their life to giving us the freedom we so take for granted.<br />I thank them and their families for the sacrifice they make daily, so I can live my life safely and continue to be a free citizen of this great country.<br />You men and women are the best.<br />This book will not disappoint you, it will inspire you to live a better life. It will show you there is a whole other world out there that we never see.

B008MG1E4A|2.0|The book is an interesting read but nothing special.  It would be more interesting to look behind the scene of the decision making process.<br /><br />I had regrets buying this book given the operator broke his Promise of life time secrecy to his comrades and brothers.  There is an oath taken before you walk into that building at DEVGRU and the SEAL broke that oath.<br /><br />Given his tainted honor I wonder how much of what he has written can be believed.
B0012GN2I8|4.0|This album is excellent & it's a shame that it gets totally overlooked by fans & critics... I understand at the time it came out the music scene was changing & going in a different direction but I can only say that to those who love Herbie' s music this album is definitely worth getting it is better then most give it credit for & I think it is one of Herbie' s better albums its got all the funky elements of his earlier albums & just as good... Some may agree with me & some may not but either  way after listening to this album none can deny it is a good album...

0525953728|5.0|Firsthand story he had the guts to tell, just like he had the guts to be a SEAL.  As he said in the book, if the Commander in chief and several others could tell their version, the soldiers who actually risked their lives should be able to tell it like it really happened.  No techniques not already documented by other SEALS or movies about their endurance training and attention to detail were exposed.  Honoring his fellow soldiers and those who died in action, he gives us all a glimpse of what it really means to complete a mission.  Proud of \\"Mark Owen\\" and all his team mates, from the mother of a US Army soldier.

B006QVRVJK|4.0|In what I presume to be an excellent adaptation of the play, Roman Polanski's 'Carnage' focuses on the parents of two boys, one of which has attacked another with a stick and caused some facial damage, including knocking out a couple of teeth.<br /><br />In an effort to remain civil, the parents of the \\"attacker\\" visit the home of the \\"victim\\" in order to sort out the problem.<br /><br />From the very beginning, there's a kind of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' style tension in the room that is always threatening to expand into something much worse, despite the fact that both sets of parents are initially interested in civil discourse. As events unfold, gradually the parents attitudes change and things become more and more uncomfortable.<br /><br />'Carnage', due to Polanski's excellent handling of the directorial reins, never spills over into farce, even though the story threatens to do so at times. It's kept controlled and simmering, the tension lasts the whole running time and unlike the aforementioned Elizabeth Taylor film (as great as it is), it stays somewhat within the realms of reality.<br /><br />The film is also helped immensely by excellent performances by the four leads, especially from Jodie Foster who just grabs her part and goes at it with great gusto. She also has the hardest role to play.<br /><br />A short film that doesn't do anything more than expected of it and well worth a view.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I've had sleep troubles for a long time now and this is my new favorite app.  When I wake up during the night I start the &quot;rain &quot;sounds and pretty soon I'm catching some more zzzzzz's!  Love the timer feature too.

B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Overall a pretty disappointing movie. Turned Arnies portrayal into sub performing joke of a great character.<br /><br />1. Conan was not only a giant among men in character but a large barbarian in stature as well.<br /><br />2. His story is a sad story and one that left him a brooding man who disdained magic and never trusted most wizards. This Conan was neither brooding nor afraid of magic he acted more like a teenage D&D wanna-be<br /><br />3. terrible editing, a few scenes were so chopped you can easily tell when the cameras started rolling, and the story was not smooth in transition<br /><br />Personally this needed to be an epic film. Instead it turned the quiet brooding barbarian into a serial blabbering made for TV child film with no mystery. Doyle must be rolling in his grave at the slandering and maiming of one of his best characters. Perhaps an insightful director and producer can yet salvage and create a masterpiece if they really understand the character and his story.<br /><br />Will never recommend this movie to anyone and thankfully I got to see it for free because it is not even worth $5.00 in a Walmart bin
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I started to read this book out of curiosity, after a visit to Southport, NC.  We had enjoyed our visit to this lovely quaint little town so much that I was curious to see how they'd portray it.  I loved the fact that I felt I was back on our vacation again, as he described this community so well.  As a relatively new resident to this wonderful state of North Carolina, I love how the author writes such beautiful stories of the people and places in North Carolina.  I had no sooner picked up the book when I knew it was going to be almost impossible to put down.  I don't write reviews talking about the events or story line.  Other people do that so much more eloquently, so I'll leave that up to them.  But this is not just a \\"tug on your heart strings\\" love story....it's exciting, and scarey and loved the twists and turns right up till the very end. I've recommended this book to just about everyone I know.  They just finished filming the movie in Southport the week before we visited.  I only hope the writers and directors stayed with the real story line!  A great read!
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|This is a great movie and true to life. The Ikea scenes were a bit forced and not at all appealing to me but overall the characters are easy to relate to. We all know someone like Summer and we've all felt like the protagonist. Joseph Gordon Levitt shows off his great acting skills. I would watch it again.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app hasn't worked well since the last update.  It crashes a lot.  I love the idea of mobile Pintrest, I just wish it worked better.  I like the ease of navigation, it just crashes a whole lot.
B009ARMS1I|4.0|We spend part of this episode in high school in Ohio with the Glee Club.  We also cut to New York City, the new home of Rachel and Kurt. Rachel is in school and is having a tough time as the pressure is relentless and the teachers demanding bordering on cruel.  Kurt is not in school but is going to try to break into show business.  These are the only students who have graduated whom we follow in this episode so it is unknown whether we will follow Finn in the army, Quinn at Yale, Mercedes and Santana wherever they have gone, etc.,<br /><br />On the high school level we are left with some of the old cast and then get new ones.  There is a new female singer with a similar talent level to Rachel's who is probably going to be the new star. Kurt's boyfriend, played by Darren Criss, and shown in the picture here with Jane Lynch (Sue Sylvester) are back and their roles are fairly prominent.  So the glee club is reforming with a mix of the old students and new ones, all headed by Matthew Morrison as their teacher.<br /><br />Does this substantial change in casting work?  Frankly it is too early to tell.  The musical numbers were all at their same high level so there has been no loss there. I found myself a bit more interested in the New York City story simply because it involves older people who are trying out in the show biz world.  I am a bit more curious about that than I am about high school.<br /><br />Rachel and the new girl both sing Billy Joel's NEW YORK STATE OF MIND. Although they do perfect jobs, I still prefer Billy Joel doing it. That is always my reaction when someone else tries this tune. This remains a problem on GLEE.  Not a single student has shown any original song writing talent, like Billy Joel, which is a formidable barrier to those with singing talent.  They are always doing covers on this show.
B008XG1X18|3.0|its a good app but it force closes a lot! usually every other time I open it up or try to go back from an image
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Ewan McGregor is a wonderful actor.  He can do just about any role.  In MOULIN ROUGE we discovered he was an astonishingly good singer who had turned down a rock and roll career in favor of an acting career. In the STAR WARS franchise we saw him as an action hero.  In this film he plays an utterly endearing scientist with Asperger's Syndrome.  He is a civil servant in the UK working with fish who suddenly finds himself caught up in a madcap scheme to bring flycasting trout fishing to the country of Yemen at the behest of an incredibly wealthy shiek. Initially it is the UK government which forces him into this but the charismatic shiek himself and a female colleague in distress over her MIA soldier boyfriend totally enmesh him in the scheme. If you are looking for a feel good film after a stressful day, this is it.  It is utterly charming.  As a side note, I am really glad to see that Ewan McGregor has not enmeshed himself in total trash films.  This is often what happens when an actor hits it big.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0063GORYU|5.0|Really fun and causes you to critically think and make appropriate moves. My eleven year old even likes the challenge of what moves are best.
B00881VLCE|4.0|my only problem is that it slows down ever so often and you cannot get a puzzle piece to move from the reserve
B007J4T2G8|2.0|book was ok but not one of my favs.  it's keeps repeating the same stuff all the time and about 90% of the book was all about sex sorry but this book wasn't for me
B00122LXTM|2.0|I AM A FAN OF THE DOOBIE BROS THE SONG SELECTION IS GOOD BUT THE AUDIO IS VERY POOR THERE IS ALOT OF BREAKING UP AND CHOPING AND BREAKING UP.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My favorite app!!!!  Very User friendly!  Great graphic and wonderful to use at home or work.  I recommend. this everyone.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Everyone should have one of these for there Kindle and it is truly amazing that it fits so snug inside the sleeve and it keeps it protected from any elements. Thanks for such an amazing item.
0345803493|3.0|a little predictable and repetitious.. Everyone is reading it so needed to find out what all the buzz was able.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|liv it!! get it!! I thought it was fun... all the other games are just one thing... this has TONS of mini games
B0085YNML2|5.0|A sidestep of an Angry Birds / Cut The Rope mix, this game is great fun. Can be frustrating, but as with any physics-type game, the \\"FINALLY!\\" sigh you let out when a level is completed is one of relief and accomplishment.
B0087HT36U|4.0|wish there was more I really like this game. had fun with it. have done all old it. wish there was more like it.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|Immediately drawn into the world of this boy and the man. Follow the growth of their relationship from prejudicial misunderstanding to love, one is with these wonderful actors all the way.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|it was working amazing the first few months but now... when me or my friends choose a word it selects a different word... weird...
B004UID2LC|1.0|great if you want to view the videos in the menu but wont let me load and play anything. gives me some cruddy error that blames my Internet connection. which is good enough for youtube's webpage, but not this lame azz app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that this is an awesome comparison to the Pc version even though it is missing some vital things like redstinenand double chests but for its point in development it isnpretty good. For those that can'txplay it on the fire try deleting some unimportant stuff and trying again.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|once you get into this game you don't want to stop playing.  the graphics are great and my kids liked it too so give it a try you will enjoy it.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Up to now I have been a keen \\"Jack Reacher\\" fan but will not invest in another after this complete waste of time. Mr. Child have you completely lost it? Do you not have any standards? Perhaps it is past time to bring this series to an end but please do it with some dignity to the famous and well liked character of Jack Reacher.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|i have not seen  it yet,it was given to friend for her b-day! it came just on time for a gift!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I won't be buying this Kindle book from Amazon due to the price.  The difference between the hard copy and the e-book costs make for an easy decision.  I will check the book out of the library in either format and read it at my leisure.<br />Amazon, it is time to realize that there should be an advantage to the consumer when getting an e-book.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|I watched tucker and dale vs. evil out of pure curiosity and im glad i did. I found it to much better than i imagined. The two hillbillies play there parts perfectly and share great chemistry. And the college kids do there parts well too. But the heart of the movie is the two hillbillies and as said before they do not disappoint. The encounters and miss understandings between the hillbillies and college kids make for a lot of fun. I will be watching this movie frequently and i suggest you check it out as well. The emphasis is more on the comedy in this movie but make no mistake things do get bloody and when they do its pulled of quite well. Its a great horror comedy with a innovative story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app it works great on my kindle fire! this is a must have for all pinterest users!!
B0089LT8Y6|3.0|Before people start bashing me for giving dark roots of earth three stars. I want to make it clear testament are one of my favorite bands and i have nothing but respect for the fact chuck billy has come back so strong after beating cancer. But droe doesn't even begin to compare to testaments old releases or the new releases from overkill or kreator. While i do think droe is a improvement over the formation of damnation i find it largely forgettable once its over. Chuck billy's voice is as strong as ever and the music behind him is decent enough but thats it decent. And aside from true american hate,native blood and a day in the death  nothing really stays with me when its over. And some may find this nitpicking but the lyrics are a little underwhelming as well.
034580404X|5.0|i loveeeeeed this book ... my hubby was really happy with this purchase ;) .... although i now have a imaginary prince charming !!!! called Christian Grey ....
1455502758|5.0|I was in complete anticipation of tears while reading Hitchens final essays. Instead I found an inspirational and moving collection of stories. The content is grim of course, cancer is my ultimate fear (probably many others as well). I felt it hard to confront reality, but a journey that needed to be taken, unfortunately the subject was Hitchens. I cried the day I read he died. Now I can smile knowing his wit, irony, and light burned as bright as the sun until his last moments. Live a good life filled with friends, lovers, wine, and good books. Peace and Love All!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|its a good book .... beautiful love story ... well written .... cant wait for the second part to come out
B000JML90Y|5.0|Its a great book, with quality, the interfaces Its pretty neat and simple, you can zoom in if you nees it
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie was one of the most inspiring and heart moving movies that I have ever seen. I think every young man and woman  should watch this movie to get a glimpse of the reality of war and the sacrifice serving our country takes. Absolutly great film!
B007QNRMUU|4.0|It is not my favorite CD of Jason Mraz, but it is enjoyable in a different way than the others.
B008I3R2VG|4.0|3 and a 1/2 stars if I could give it that.<br />Battle Born has had 6 days of heavy playing at my home, work and car and each day has seen my review become slightly more favourable. Which is good as it was going to be a `killer' at first.<br /><br />On the first few listens to Battle Born my impressions were:<br />Disappointment<br />Not what I was expecting or hoping for<br />Synths for synths sake?<br />Where are the guitars?<br />Where's the power? What's up with these ballads? THE KILLERS DON'T DO BALLADS!!!<br />Where are the hooks and melodies?<br />Where's this `ace' that Brandon Flowers said he saved from his solo album?<br />Who let U2 in the room?<br />The first positive I picked up on is how good BF's voice sounds here. He's certainly improved since his Sam's Town delusions of grandeur.<br /><br />So it's fair to say that I WAS NOT IMPRESSED with Battle Born on its early listenings. My opinion has improved somewhat but I'm still not happy. It's not an album of hooks and melodies as was Day and Age. The power of Sam's Town is missing and the edge of Hot Fuss is non-existent.<br /><br />I absolutely love Runaways. I think it's one of the best songs they've done. It's the only standout here though. I was hoping The K's would take everything they've done in the past and create their own identity but all they've done here is made themselves sound like other bands.<br /><br />When you get a new album you have a listen. Then another one and a track (other than the single(s) you know) stands out for you. You give that one track some extra listening. You feel good and then another track will standout and so forth and the rest of the album builds around those stand outs. On listening to this one though, that didn't happen for me.<br /><br />On past albums, synths have played a big part but here, they've overdone, generic and pointless. They don't add to most songs but are present in almost all of them.<br /><br />On a plus, there's nothing really bad here. It's perhaps their most consistent album to date. That's also its problem. Each song blends with the next and nothing grabs you. No one song lets the rest down but other than Runaways, nothing else truly rises to the challenge.<br /><br />It's an album of interesting sounding verses but in many cases, the chorus lets the song down by being clichéd or generic. An album that perhaps belongs in the 80's where many of these sounds seem to be from.<br /><br />As for the songs:<br />4/5 - Flesh And Bone is one of the stronger tracks. Catchy and a good mix of synth and rock. My kids love this one too.<br />5/5 - Runaways is brilliant, one of their best ever.<br />4/5 - The Way It Was is OK. It's pretty lightweight though. It lies between rock and power ballad and is lacking something. Wasn't overly fussed on it until the last fading: \\"maybe a thief stole your heart' struck a chord with me.<br />3/5 - Here With me reminds me of the REO Speedwagon song of the same name. The first of three ballads. Not fussed on this 80's sounding power ballad. I skip this track more than any other.<br />3/5 - A Matter Of Time is a reasonable song with a bad chorus.<br />4/5 - Deadlines And Commitments at first sounded like bad 80's movie soundtrack song to me but has grown on me and is one of my favourite tracks. Reminds me a bit Robert Palmer.<br />3.5/5 - Miss Atomic Bomb is U2. It's an OK song and one of the better ones but it just sounds like them trying to sound like U2. And the line: \\"You're gonna miss me when I'm gone\\". C'mon!! be original!!<br />3/5 - The Rising Tide borders on annoying. It's OK and I'm not really sure why I feel this way about it but I skip this one often. I hope, in time, I can like this one more. More mid-tempo over-synthed fare.<br />3/5 - Heart Of A Girl is more U2. The second ballad. It's OK I guess but would be better if, again, it wasn't a plain U2 rip off - and maybe released in the 90's. And \\"a ripple in the water\\" makes me cringe. Nice message though and is almost an OK track.<br />4/5 - From Here On Out is finally some fun. Perhaps better suited on BF's solo but a nice track. At leasts it's up-tempo!!<br />3/5 - Be Still features a... a.... a.. DRUM MACHINE!!! What? You have a drummer!! Use him. You don't use a drum machine!!! On the plus side, this one is sung very well. Maybe the pick of the ballads - the ballads that don't belong on a Killers album. \\"Is this real or just a dream?\\" - more original writing.<br />4/5 Battle Born hooray!! Finally some power. Good track this one and finally some semblance of the previous Killer sound. It's what the rest of the album should be like. Something to get excited about here but, oh dear, the albums over.....<br /><br />The bonus tracks are OK - there are five on my copy. Carry Me Home sounds like a boring Day & Age throwaway. Prize Fighter is a good, fun song and could probably find its way onto the album in lieu of one of the ballads. The remixes: (Flesh and Bone and Runaways) are what rock remixes are - pointless exercises that retract from the original. The Be Still alternative cut is an interesting one. It loses the drum machine and allows Ronnie to participate. It won't go as far to say it's better (because I think both versions could do with some stripping down) but at least there's no drum machine.<br /><br />My favourite Killers album to date has been Day & Age. This new album ranks last in their four albums and also rates behind Brandon Flowers' solo effort - which I also love.<br /><br />I will go as far to say that Battle Born is my biggest musical disappointment for over a decade. Perhaps the hiatus has seen the boys use their best material for their solo stuff and what's presented here has been left a little thin?<br /><br />I still love The Killers. this one 'slight' mis-step doens't erase the countless hours of enjoyment they've brought me over the past 8 years. Here's hoping in time I'll be able to come back, admit I was wrong, retract this review and rewrite a positive one......
B001229W22|5.0|Whenever an album (or any piece of media, for that matter) reaches a certain level of cultural and critical fame, there's a risk of backlash from the listening public.  Expectations have been set very high coming in, and new listeners are not likely to be forgiving if the album falls short, no matter how unattainable what was promised might be.  It seems being overrated is a far worse crime than being merely of poor quality.<br /><br /> This is the challenge that Master of Puppets finds itself in.  Metallica's third album has been widely hailed not only as a brilliant achievement, but a clear contender for the title of greatest metal album ever composed.  That's no small claim, and whether or not it holds up in the end, expectations are still going to be incredibly high.<br /><br /> And I have a hard time believing that it doesn't meet them.  Giving this record a listen for what may be the hundredth time, it's a testament to Metallica's compositional prowess how fresh it still sounds.  There's a bit of magic in the performance; the band is angry, unforgiving, and inspired, and it shows throughout the fifty-some minute running time.  Hetfield gives his definitive performance here, with his melodic snarl melding perfectly with Kirk Hammet's harsh, oft-chugging guitar work.  Cliff Burton bass is as good as the band has ever been, and Lars... well... he can hit drums somewhat competently, I suppose.  Every song is given the treatment it deserves here, from the colossal \\"Battery\\" to the proggy instrumental \\"Orion\\".<br /><br /> The typical Metallica album layout is here, and refined to perfection.  \\"Battery\\" is an up-tempo thrasher hard enough to break your teeth on, but still catchy enough to follow from the first listen.  \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Disposable Heroes\\" are both epics, with some of the best solos of Kirk Hammet's career.  \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" is a great improvement on the similarly-styled \\"Fade to Black\\" from [[ASIN:B000002H2H Ride the Lightning]], with a light, melodic first half, and a heavy, instrumental second half.  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is another Lovecraft-inspired bit of horror; it may have a plodding pace, but it fits the subject matter perfectly.  \\"Orion\\" is the instrumental; Metallica seemed to be going with a progressive feel for this one - it strikes me as vaguely Opeth-ian, which is a very good thing.  With light, atmospheric work blending with the heavier riffs and organic solos, this one is a real winner.  Some songs, such as \\"Leper Messiah\\" are admittedly weaker than the rest, but that just means the bar is set to \\"high\\" rather than \\"very high\\".<br /><br /> Master of Puppets is undoubtedly required listening, and I would recommend getting any non-metal friends around to listen as well.  You may not win any converts, but it is textbook metal, and will give them a better idea than anything of what the genre is about.<br /><br /> Best metal album ever?  Maybe.<br /> One you'll still be listening to years from now?  Definitely.th a light, melodic first half, and a heavy, instrumental second half.  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is another Lovecraft-inspired bit of horror; it may have a plodding pace, but it fits the subject matter perfectly.  \\"Orion\\" is the instrumental; Metallica seemed to be going with a progressive feel for this one - it strikes me as vaguely Opeth-ian, which is a very good thing.

B007SSEBCU|4.0|This is a very entertaining and well done movie. Here's the low down:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great acting<br />Entertaining from beginning to the end.<br />Informative<br /><br />Cons:<br />Movie only focuses on some of the highlights of her life. Most is not covered<br />To understand and appreciate the movie, one must have prior knowledge of her presidential events. The movie does not explain the events and does not put them into perspective.<br />The movie leaves you wanting to know more about events and characters discussed.<br /><br />This is not a documentary and the movie does not attempt to provide a biography of her life. It would be impossible to discuss her life's events in a couple hour entertaining movie. The movie does not take a position on whether her legacy was good or bad. It simply puts the events out there. I don't agree with many reviews that deride this movie for some of these reasons.<br /><br />I do recommend this movie to anyone who wants an entertaining movie about some of the highlights of the Iron Lady's life.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the game is so awesome cause I had it be for and it got uninstaled and never put it back on my kindel fire then I seen the zombie samire and then I looked and now you can be a zombie or a samire and then I was downloadin<br />and then renumbered thati did not download it cause it takes so long to download and when I was downloading the app then I had to watt so long git it and I rodent download it after I could then if my kindel got messed upturn there it go's/well awesome app and peace:)
1439153663|5.0|I saw this book on a reading site and became interested after reading the editorial review and book description.  Even though it was a first book by a new author, I took a chance and ordered it from Amazon. Wow, am I glad I did!  This story ranks among the very best of books I've read, and I've read a LOT of books.  I always enjoy a story about Southern plantations, but this book tells the story from the slaves point of view.  The author grabs your attention from the very first page, and I was riveted throughout the entire book (I finished it in 2 days).  As you might expect, this is not a light read.  All of the characters experience heartbreak and horrors, they feel trapped in their circumstances. I felt I got to know the characters and felt their pain and emotional turmoil.  This book gives the reader a new appreciation for what it was actually like to be a slave in the south.  I had toured a plantation when we visited South Carolina several years ago and recalled the actual slave cabins I saw there and how very small they were.  It was easy to imagine the characters from this story living in those cramped, sparse quarters.<br /><br />If you like historical fiction and are looking for a book that will both teach you something and touch your heart, this is it. This book will stay with you for years to come; I know it affected me deeply. Excellent first book by a new author - I can't wait for her next one!
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Winter of the World is volume 2 of a saga covering all of the 20th century, focusing on four interrelated families: American, British, German and Russian. Follett has done a commendable job of juggling these characters using their personal stories to lead the reader (in this volume) through the major historical events of an era running from 1933 to 1949 (the rise of Nazism to the beginning of the Cold War).<br />His huge cast of characters is made up of plastic, credible humans, many of whom are capable of growing into the situations thrust upon them, and by situations that are sometimes almost too horrible for words - but are nonetheless borne out by history. Yes, these things actually happened!<br />Follett leads us through the burning of the Reichstag, the Spanish civil war, Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, Stalin's mistrust of his own espionage agents and the resulting disasters, the Battle of Britain, etc. and manages to make it all close and personal! Missing however (the reason I withheld the 5th star) are the heroic rescue effort at Dunkirk, the saturation bombings (fire bombings) of places like Guernica, Dresden and Hamburg and especially, the siege of Leningrad! I'm not sure how an 872 day siege with its tremendous loss of life and unimaginable heroism escaped the author's notice. Granted, none of his characters were there and putting them there might have been difficult. But, to leave it unmentioned?<br />Clearly, covering the history of that period is an enormous project, but the enormity is no excuse for skipping events that are key to the memories the various nations involved ... the carnage that was D-Day was also brushed over lightly.<br />Critique notwithstanding, the book was fast-paced, exciting, and really hard to put down! I'm looking forward to the 3rd volume, but first I intend to re-read this one.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|On my Kindle Fire there was already a direct link on there when I bought it. I just got the Kindle Fire HD and upon starting it up for the first time it asked for my FB & Twitter info which made me think both apps came on the new Kindle Fire HD. This was not so, so I'm not sure of the purpose if the apps do not already come on it.<br /><br />The app itself seems legit. It being pretty low on the search list made me hesitant.<br /><br />EDIT: The app has some glitches to it. Will freeze at times or restart the page as you're doing something.

0525953728|4.0|Personally, I've been involved in the military community ever since I can remember. Both of my parents worked for the US military, I worked with the military, and have been supporting our military veterans in my own capacity for years. Thus, I wasn't much interested in reading a book that had a heavy emphasis on a mission that has yet to be declassified. I mean, how much can you learn about a case that is still heavily cloaked by the agencies?<br /><br />However, it peaked my interest when most of the one star reviews cited unethical disclosure and disclosures of classified information that could jeapordize our national security. I had to find out why the current administration and the CIA are contemplating on taking legal actions to censure this book; I had to see if this patriot had crossed the line that would turn him into a traitor instead. Funny, isn't it? For once, negative actions of these folks prompted me to purchase a book that I would not normally have pursued.<br /><br />I read the book in two days as soon as I received it.<br /><br />First of all, the book is divided into two major sections : pre OBL mission and the OBL mission.<br /><br />The first half of the book delved into the authors motivations and experiences prior to the operation. He detailed his initial exposure to the elite forces culture, the experiences of his youth, and his subequent pursuit of his carrer. It is in this section that readers might find his narrative a bit disorientating. This section is not written in strict chronological sequence; he bounces between episodes of his training with past reminesences of his youth. I found this section mildly interesting due to the absense of sensitive details of his training and missions; I fouund this section to be endearing due to the cohesiveness of his childhood experiences and those of his adult values. Nothing here can really be scrutinized for questionable content. It was simply the autobiographical section of the book.<br /><br />TheOBL mission took up the second half of the book. While I found this section to be an interesting read, the obvious lack of sensitive 'secrets' is what prompted me to write this review in the authors' defense. The author told the story from his personal experience without disclosing the mariad of details he could have exposed of the intelligence community and of the  peripheral operational components. He expressed only of his reactions and actions without exposing others that made the mission possible. The operational summary he had written in this book would be of common knowledge to anyone who simply delve into the subject and thus could not be construed 'sensitive' by any means.<br /><br />A few reviewers condemned the tidbits of political remarks the author related between his mates. The remarks were simply sarcastic exchanges that lighten moods rather than making political statements; similar remarks would have been made no matter who was in the white house. For that matter, any stressful work place would find similar jokes about management and bosses during their downtime.<br /><br />The author disclosed that his central motivation for writing this book was to, perhaps, motivate a future special forces operative to pursue this noble endeavor. For such, I felt he did a marvelous job. This book is engaging, patriotic, personalble while not being overbearing. It's not Shakespearean; it's not supposed to be. Trying to judge this book by literary standard is simply absurd. It is a young adult read that was well put together for its stated purpose!

B009329Y30|5.0|Very good movie. Of course the book contained a lot more detail, and I think one should read it also.
B008966SIU|5.0|This newest entry is a definite jem in the The grizzly bear Catalog. Listening to it one gets that real sense of emotional adventure and longing that we have all come to know and love in Grizzly Bears music. From start to finish this Piece of art keeps the listener fully entertained. The Variety of sounds and textures weave in and out throughout the album, bouncing back and forth between loud cacophonous jams and minimalist breakdowns. Everything on Shields seems very formulaic and structured and this really helps the album. Many people are saying this album is the best of both worlds from their past two albums: \\"Yellow house\\" and \\"Veckatimest\\". This to a certain degree is correct however I think that Shields spends more time breaking new ground then just reproducing the past. In Many ways this is this may be the best album to come out this year and I look forward to continued listenings.<br /><br />It's worth noting that with any great piece of art it takes multiple viewings to fully understand all the complexities in this album.

B008FOB124|5.0|The new Dead Can Dance, to me, is a return to form, and MORE than I expected to get. I am a huge DCD fan from the era of 1985 to 1990. I did like Into the Labyrinth, but it had some fillers, imo. And when I heard Spiritchaser, I checked the cd again to make sure it was DCD. Sounded more like a Lisa Gerrard side project than a DCD album. Now to be fair, the new DCD album has MANY similarities to the last Brendan Perry solo album. To ME, this is a good thing, as I prefer the Perry songs of DCD compared to the Gerrard songs. Brendan Perry's ARK was a success. It was how his first album should have sounded. Now, Anastasis may not have as strong of standouts as Ark (Wintersun and Utopia), HOWEVER it is a more CONSISTENT album from start to finish. There's really no filler songs or tracks I would skip. Also, there's no weird songs that disrupt the flow of the album, like what Toward the Within and Into the Labyrinth had. Slightly darker as well, like I said, THIS album should have been the follow up to Aion. A GREAT release and a great return to form. I do want to be clear though, Into the Labyrinth is a great album, and really I should say Anastasis is the best album since Into the Labyrinth. If you enjoyed DCD of the 1985-1991 era, get this NOW. You won't be disappointed! Welcome back Dead Can Dance. Here's to many more pieces of art in the future.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Read this on vacation due to the amount of good reviews.  The writing is great, characters development great but the plausability of the middle and ending flunked.  I was on a plane and almost threw my iPad out of sheer frustration.<br /><br />She has a Master's in Psy......Both her parents have degrees in Psy.  YET....according to her diary, she is being abused and doesn't seek intervention.<br /><br />I couldn't do better, but I still have my day job.

B008MZPVP4|5.0|Down has yet again made another killer album.  Staying true to their roots, with their Raw & Live feel,  and delivering six new bone crushing pure southern metal tracks. Phil Anselmo, as always, takes his unique growling voice to new levels.  While Pepper Keenan and Kirk Windstein feed us with nothing short of a massive wall of guitar riffs.  With tracks like \\"Witchtripper\\" \\"The Curse Is A Lie\\" and \\"Misfortune Teller\\" this E.P. is sure to be a classic amongst old and new fans. Do yourself a favor. Snag this album, crank it all the way up and get ready for it to rattle your soul.
B008XFAT7S|4.0|Great action and hand to hand combat. The story is pretty guessable, but you stay for the fighting! Definitely check it out!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I was surprised. As a 55 year old, I thought this was another \\"teen movie\\". While that is the intended audience, it has the basics: plot, acting, great scenery, and left an open door for more movies to come. Well worth it; and Amazon streaming was always on target.
B008M34INW|4.0|I was just skulking thru Amazon movies one night and decided to give this a try. This movie has an interesting prison concept set to film.Turns out it was quite good. Not too much crazy action, but some. More subtle than overt humor. Totally worth my time.
B009329ZF2|3.0|This was a good Navy recruiting tool. When watching the movie, suspend belief. However there are some highlights:<br /><br />Navy ships in action<br />CGI was very good!<br />The Army Colonel was believable. He is a Army vet and suited for the part!<br />Back drop: Hawaii!<br /><br />Suspend belief on ...<br /><br />Getting the USS Missouri underway in an hour (should be a couple of days)<br />Live ammo on the museum<br />A long-haired Irish admiral?<br /><br />However, this is a great Navy recruiting piece. I was entertained; but just go into the movie and suspend belief and enjoy the ride. The aliens are typical. It's almost a mashup between Transformers, Independence Day, and Die Hard.<br /><br />But for home, a good romp.
1449314287|5.0|I have read several chapter on the 2nd edition of the book, but that one i just borrow from my friends. This time i decide to buy my self the book. I really satisfy with it.

The authors will introduce to you several good tools to manage you MySQL database but Percone Toolkit will get more highlight .

B006T3RM08|5.0|I was looking for a solution that would put my two devices together.  The clique was the perfect solution. I was very happy with the quality and ease of implementation. Nothing too it, just snap it together.<br /><br />It would be nice if it came in black. My iMac has a nice black bezel that would go nicely if the frame was black.

B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I love all the Indiana Jones films and was very excited to see them finally made available on Blu-Ray. The picture quality is really outstanding and it is like being able to watch them all again for the first time! The image is so clear sharp and vibrant. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because of the awkward packaging!<br />I have never liked the cardboard sleeve style storage for CD, DVD or Blu-Ray.  They are hard to remove without getting greasy finger prints along the outer edges and overtime the disc always end up getting scratch and scuff marks just by removing and replacing them in the snug fitting sleeve. I would have much preferred a box set with an individual blue ray case for each separate disc.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I teach a high school class on film appreciation, news production and video editing. I first saw this film in a theater in 1967 and it made a great impact on me. This is the first film I cover with in my level one classes and take it apart scene by scene. By far, it is the best film to start with, the mirror shots, the acting and the innovation and radical approach of Hitchcock are evidient throughout the film. I am often asked by my students, \\"what are you favorite films?\\". I replay, \\"I have five films and four of them change day by day but Psycho is always in that top five. Do some research on the film. It is amazing for it's time and even for today!
0930289234|5.0|The first time I ever read \\"Watchmen\\" I was 15 years-old. I was lucky: here in Brazil it was released in 6 volumes, so I didn't have to eat my fingernails for 12 months like you guys in the US. Later on, in 1999, it was re-released in its original 12 volumes, but this time around, twice a month. In both opportunities, I bought 'em, 'cos in the mid-eighties release, I couldn't get acquainted with its original covers, which happend only in the late 1990s re-issue. The memory that stuck with me ever since, and whenever I read it again: this is a must-read comic book masterpiece. Permeated with his peculiar storytelling, Moore paints an interesting picture of how would the real world be if superheroes walked amongst ordinary people and its implications. In its several pages, you never get the sensation of being had. You don't get the feeling of having your precious time wasted. Based upon actual scientific facts, proving that Moore is for the comics what Kubrick was for the cinema, he sews an intricate web filled with suspense, in his unique way approaches the ethics of power and its consequences if applied by someone with the means and pragmatic enough to do it, and gives birth to one of the most hard-to-copy pieces of the genre. After the live action incarnation, I had to add the english version to my collection. I couldn't resist! Now I can read it in its original lexicon.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app I love it its helpful in mostly everything from telling me when I need to charge it to when it is at full charge.
B00881VLCE|5.0|XIMAD Inc. made a really great puzzle app. It is different from all the others because of simple and user-friendliness. I definitely recommend it!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a really good game.  The design is so clean, and it's one of those \\"moments to learn, a lifetime to master\\" type of things.  My wife is not a big gamer, and she was hooked in no time at all.  \\"I love the music\\" was one of her comments.<br /><br />I got the app a few weeks ago when it was the free app of the day, and I like it so much I've purchased the original Quell game to support the developer (and get the first version of the game).  Keep up the good work!
B0034G4P4O|4.0|Tin Tin(released Dec/11)is a brilliant animated feature directed by Steven Spielberg.The look and feel are totally life like;although the characters themselves are slightly exaggerated so one doesn't forget that this is just animation,when circumstances on screen get too\\"real\\" or not.Herge's creation has been around for years,being Belgian born and raised,and first hitting the media in the late 20s.Now Spielberg and company have gotten control of Herge's creation and come up with this new animated movie,full of excitement,comedy and adventure.And I believe Tin Tin is in good hands here.<br />The plot involves Tin Tin,a Thin Man/Indiana Jones combo young man,and his faithful wire haired terrier Snowflake.He acquires a model ship at a flea market and from there his troubles start.It seems other agents want that ship too.It contains a scroll in one of the masts,one of three,that someone needs to complete a bigger puzzle,leading to a kings ransom.<br />Tin Tin is captured and taken on board a ship.He meets up with Capt.Haddock,a drunk whose ship Tin Tin's captors have taken control of.When they reach land in Morocco they find another model ship owned by a Shiek and it is then Capt.Haddock relates the tale of his ancestor who captained the original ship the models are based on.It was his ancestor who had to purposely scuttle his own ship and only he and his descendants know the exact location of the treasure,everyone now seeks.<br />The rest of the film is taken up trying to outwit and survive the onslaughts of those that would seek the treasure and kill Tin Tin,Snowy and Capt.Haddock.Will the adventuresome trio succeed?<br />There is no doubt the ending was as spectacular as the events leading up to it.The sense of humour and twists and turns never abate throughout the film,which leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat awaiting what will happen next.It is not too many animated films that can generate this kind of excitement and interest,but this one does in spades.The only drawback I found was with the length and intricacy of the plot.While it may be fine for the older set,the younger ones tend to squirm in their seats.I know,having taken my grandchildren to its premiere and sitting in an audience full of children.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 1:85:1 w/s a/r.Extras include featurettes on the making of Tin Tin and one on Snowy.<br />All in all a highly recommended film for the whole family,filled with lots of exciting adventures and humour which will keep you on the edge of your seats from beginning to end.The length and plot twists and turns will have your younger ones turning into squirmers.Listen for the voice talents of Daniel Craig,Nick Frost,Simon Pegg,Andy Serkis,among many others.he only drawback I found was with the length and intricacy of the plot.While it may be fine for the older set,the younger ones tend to squirm in their seats.I know,having taken my grandchildren to its premiere and sitting in an audience full of children.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 1:85:1 w/s a/r.Extras include featurettes on the making of Tin Tin and one on Snowy.<br />All in all a highly recommended film for the whole family,filled with lots of exciting adventures and humour which will keep you on the edge of your seats from beginning to end.The length and plot twists and turns will have your younger ones turning into squirmers.Listen for the voice talents of Daniel Craig,Nick Frost,Simon Pegg,Andy Serkis,among many others.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|You have got to have a little sympathy with Aimee Mann's ex-partners, she certainly has made a career of tearing strips out of them, which tradition continues with her latest musical offering.<br />It contains the usually fascinating mix of dark & cutting lyrics, but catchy music, which always make an interesting contrast.<br />Her strongest albums are \\"Whatever\\" & \\"Bachelor No. 2\\", & since then, Mann has released a steady run of good 4star albums, but not outstanding, which also includes \\"Charmer\\"<br />If she had played the game a little more, I think Aimme could have been considerably more successful, good for her for sticking to her principles.<br />So, a good strong album, but not perfect.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|People kept telling me I needed to read all three to get the whole story.  Well, book two was like reading book one over again, and the story was lame and could have been told in one book.  I regret buying these books.  I could have used that money to purchase some GOOD books.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This bag is surprisingly amazing. I have very few complaints. My main issue is that my Canon 60D with battery grip doesn't fit well. It will still close but it bumps out a little. I leave my battery grip on all the time so it's kind of a pain to remove it. My other issue, and it's very minor, is that the zipper pulls are pretty ugly. One of the main reasons I bought the bag was because of the sleek black but the zipper pulls have the bright neon orange 'amazon basics' logo. I will be replacing them. The bag holds my canon 60d and battery grip (better when off), 50m f1.8, 24-70f2.4, flash with diffuser, all th extra batteries and memory cards you could ever need, charger and accessories and I still have room for another lens or two.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an amazing set of books set in a future world where people live in a silo run by the tech geeks.  It is always wonderful to find a new author who is able to create a world that pulls you in, and keeps you engaged throughout a story - this one did it! The story unwraps over 5 \\"books\\" and is difficult to really say much about without giving away spoilers so let me just say - I read it in 3 days and it is one of my favorites of the summer.  Get it, and read it - you'll love it!

B008GFI3QE|4.0|There are some nice things in this documentary, especially the films of Britain in the 50s, but the rest is really everything everyone already knows about the Beatles and George Martin.  You've seen all the Beatles' film material a hundred times, if you are a fan. The books and stuff give you all kinds of detail this film omits.  One would have liked a few more interviews with people like Gerry Marsden and others from the Liverpool days.  There are some nice cuts from old Peter Sellers records and the Goons and so on. But it isn't very ground breaking (though it is way better than the horrible tribute album concocted for/by Martin of some years ago).  He's a nice fellow to be around for an hour or so, and we get to meet his wife -- the film edits out the fact that there was a first wife! --  it is all very grandfatherly and British countryside.  The best things in the documentary are the glimpse of his early life in the Fleet Air Arm (we never actually find out whether he ever was in combat (he wasn't)) and the five minutes or so on his deafness and him talking about it.
B008AS5UAO|5.0|The new recording of Mozart's DON GIOVANNI has been hyped and touted and finally it is here!  Incidentally, Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is in the current cast of this opera at the Los Angeles Opera opening this week so appetites are whetted. The audiences here were treated to Mariusz Kwiecien singing the role of Giovanni in the Los Angeles Philharmonic production this past spring under the direction of Gustavo Dudamel; he will be a tough act to follow.<br /><br />For all the drama that his recording engenders it is interesting to note that it is based on a concert performance in Baden-Baden in July 2011 with  Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin conducting the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.  His approach to the opera is lively but lacks a certain depth to make the truly dramatic scenes ring aw strongly as the lighter portions of the opera. He does however allow each of the vocalists to develop well-defined characters without superimposing tempi or mannerisms that would otherwise make this sound like a Singspiel.<br /><br />And what a cast this is!  The Don Giovanni of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo, the  sonorous bass baritone, is very dark and even in the lighter moments with Leporello he manages to always remind us of his darker side of his nature. Yes, his is a beautiful voice and he convinces us of his reputation as the lothario supreme.  But in the role of Leporello, Luca Pisaroni stands out as a baritone who will likely advance to the Giovanni role with a characterization and sound that is more completely well rounded- time for flirting as well as for evil doings. His contribution to this performance is exemplary.  The other men In this recording likewise hold forth on a very high level. Rolando Villazon as Don Ottavio sounds secure and if anything his once injured voice has a more burnished tone that is very appealing. Konstantin Wolff is a polished Masetto.<br /><br />The women are astonishingly well sung and for many it is their roles that make this recording unique.  Joyce DiDonato brings not only splendid technique in her wide range allows her to give equal beauty to both the high and low portions of Donna Elvira's role, but the personality she creates is totally credible. The tessitura of Elvira's arias has defeated many singers, being ungainly for most sopranos and high for most mezzo-sopranos who have attempted the role.  This is a role that Ms. DiDonato seems to have been born to sing and the gleam of her tone as she confidently moves from bottom to top of the voice is arresting.  As mentioned before, the stylishness with which she sings Mozart is splendid. Mojca Erdmann Gives Zerlina not only the beauty of a well schooled voice, but the snappiness of a completely conceived soubrette.  And as far as sheer beauty of voice and Mozartean sound and agility of singing Diana Damrau nearly steals the production with on of the finest Donna Anna on record. She has mastered the art of bel canto and thus is able to take greater liberties with embellishing her music than her colleagues.<br /><br />In all this is a splendid new DON GIOVANNI cast and the recording has so much going for it that the blemishes are minor.

B000063V8R|5.0|This series came in great shape and only 4 days after I ordered it through ground mail! We (my family)and 84 yr old dad,love the series.  Some are so funny, some serious and all were of good story lines.( so are the previous 2 series!)  The director and crew worked well together to produce such entertaining episodes.  My siblings and some of my husband's  siblings grew up with the Original Star Trek. I believe this STNG series are just as 'fascinating' as the old ones.  The characters are very well played by the actors and really seemed to enjoy their parts. We are collecting all seven seasons if possible; they are that good!  We really enjoy the Borg episodes, Data's \\"humanness?\\", and interaction with the whole crew. So, take on a mission and travel to new places in the galaxy!  \\"Make it so, #1!\\"
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|The prices change so much on Amazon, but overall this is one of the better sets for more of a fair price. I got it at 55$ here and it is a very cool decorative set for the LOTR Legos. It opens up, closes and is very detailed, also accurate to the movie. I liked the way the stairs were built into the mountain as well. Only complaint I have is I wish it was bigger. The minifigures included are very cool though and true to the movie with who was involved.
B000062XFG|5.0|Well packaged in good shape.  These series are our familys' favorite Star Trek shows next to the original series.  Our favorite characters are Picard, Worf, Wesley and his mom, Riker, Troi, Geordie and of course Data.  Each episode is entertaining and fun to watch. You may even learn some space science!  We recommend this for any family.  Nothing objectionable that we have seen on any of the episodes. We had StarTrek marathon days to watch 4-5 episodes in a row! Enjoyable and delightful.

You can visit Pinterest two ways on the kindle. Go directly to the website, but the icons are small and the touch tends to bring up the wrong item. Second would be this app. Logs me out of my profile a few times and again freezes. But I like how it shows the icons bigger.

B0046RE5HW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, even though I have only ever read Murder on the Orient Express and so am not a Agatha Christie fundi. We went for a holiday in Luxor, Egypt, and heard a lot about the film while we were there and so I ordered it on my kindle. I really enjoyed it, and kept thinking there would be an obvious, or else irritating ending, but I was completely surprised and amazed! Excellent plot! The only thing I should have done was keep a note of who all the characters were, because at the beginning it was really confusing who they all were and where they all fitted in. But all in all, I was impressed and happy that I ordered it. Am keen to see the movie now.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|The Killers are a band that I have always heard a lot about, but I never really paid much attention to them - until now.  When I saw that they had a new album coming out today, I decided to give them a try.  Their sound has a heavy 80's influence that at times calls to mind The Cars and Simple Minds (in the vocals anyway) with a mix of standard rock instruments along with synth and other electronic elements.  Most of the songs are up-tempo, but a couple of mellow exceptions are \\"Heart Of A Girl\\" and \\"Be Still\\".<br /><br />A lot of the songs seem to deal with relationship problems, e.g. \\"The Way It Is\\" (\\"Maybe thieves stole your heart\\"), \\"Here With Me\\" (\\"I remember when you were mine\\"), \\"A Matter Of Time\\" (\\"Look what's laying at our feet.  That's the wreckage of broken dreams, and it's here on our street\\"), and \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" (\\"You're gonna miss me when I'm gone\\").  While The Killers also deal with issues of trust on \\"The Rising Tide\\" and \\"From Here On Out\\", the album ends with encouragement on \\"Battle Born\\" - \\"When they knock you down, you're gonna get back on your feet\\".<br /><br />Overall, I found Battle Born to be an interesting change of pace.  It isn't the style that I listen to most often, but I like to mix in some variety from time to time.  Brandon Flowers voice is pretty easy to listen to, and the songs have common themes instrumentally without all sounding the same.  I would recommend giving this a try - especially if you liked 80's bands like The Cars.<br /><br />Download this:  Be Still

0671042858|4.0|What is there to say about Stephen King? While this story is not as fast paced as what you might expect from SK, it is still a good read. A little girl lost in the woods being stalked by an unknown evil and only her Boston Red Sox hero, relief pitcher, Tom Gordon, as a lifeline to civilization is, to say the least, tense. In the end she gathers all the courage that is left in her and faces the creature head on. King is a master when it comes to the written word. His characters are ordinary people who are up against circumstances that would tax the intellegence and resolve of any highly decorated Army Ranger. If you need someone to help you decide, I say, buy it; read it. You won't be disappointed.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Our family really enjoyed the Lorax. Valuable lessons for taking care of our natural resources and enjoying the simple things of life make it a learning experience as well. The characters and music pop in wonderful Seuss style. Planning to add to our perm. DVD collection.
B008XG1X18|2.0|This app simply allows you to look at the website in the mode of full site, rather than the mobile version.  Even on my large Kindle screen it made the pictures way too small.  Also, if I was on the mobile version and I click on a link in Pinterest, it always has a popup asking if I want to open it with the app, or with the browser.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  It got annoying.  Ultimately, I deleted the app and went back to just using the mobile version.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I actually liked the special effects and the sci fi action in this movie... But there were so many little items that made no sense, that I couldn't rate it any higher. Really? The aliens flew across the galaxy to get here, but their ships can only \\"hop\\" 500 feet? Dumb.

B008I3R2VG|5.0|Disclaimer: This is my favorite band of all time so please, take everything I say with a grain of salt. That said, I admit that though eventually I was able to find enjoyment from DAY & AGE I can understand why it got such criticism as it did. I love HOT FUSS but I consider SAM'S TOWN to be the essential album of The Killers. I have good news. Though BATTLE BORN may not be as good as SAM'S TOWN, it is definitely a worthy sequel. It's great to have the band back.<br /><br />BATTLE BORN is a \\"dustland fairytale\\" to the core. This is a complete and total \\"blue jean serenade\\" of layered, polished, and refined music. The production value is excellent but it is important to remember that The Killers can actually perform this live. This isn't just studio magic. This band is a premium act.<br /><br />BATTLE BORN is much more SAM'S TOWN than it is DAY & AGE but there is still some of that disco-glam-dance influence to be found. BATTLE BORN is primarily heartland rock, infused with a dose of country (a la Brandon's solo album FLAMINGO). It's an interesting blend and it's not for everyone. I know there are those who lament the band's departure from HOT FUSS but I personally appreciate the dynamic range of The Killers. I'm not going to discuss every song for once, just my absolute favorites. But enough introduction, on to the music!<br /><br />\\"Flesh and Bone\\" - At the moment this is my favorite track on BATTLE BORN. This is a rousing battle hymn if I've ever heard one. Brandon on synth and Dave on guitar are the driving force of the song but it is the lyrics that really give this song punch. I'd bet money that this is the next single released from the album.<br /><br />\\"Runaways\\" - This will always hold a special place in my heart as the first new song of the reunited Killers. From Ronnie's galloping percussion to the soaring vocals and reverberating guitar this track screams arena rock. This is a BIG song that is barely contained by the limitations of digital recording.<br /><br />\\"Matter of Time\\" - The way this track starts reminds me of HOT FUSS, with the heavier pace and the background vocals (\\"whoooa-ooo-oooo\\").  It's has a distinct \\"Somebody Told Me\\" flavor to it, with a hint of SAM'S TOWN. As another great arena rock song this will be fun to sing along to live.<br /><br />\\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" - I wasn't really digging this song at first. Like, at all. After listening to it a couple times it has really grown on me. At various times of the day I found myself singing, \\"If you should fall upon hard times...\\" An unexpected hit this one.<br /><br />\\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" - I liked this one. And then I really listened to it. And then I fell in love. This is decent...until you realize that it is the prequel to \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and it totally blows your mind. This probably has some of the best lyrics of the entire album and in true Killers fashion it tells a beautiful, sad story. It sort of reminds me of \\"Dustland Fairytale\\" one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />`The Rising Tide\\" - There is some awkward lyrical delivery on this track, the first line for instance, \\"the streets of persuasion, are plated with gold, your heart's in the right place but you traveled down the wrong road...\\" But once you get past some of the unwieldly lines (think \\"Swallow It\\" from FLAMINGO) it really is a good song. Plus there is a wicked sweet guitar riff courtesy of Dave near the end.<br /><br />\\"From Here On Out\\" - This isn't heartland rock so much as it is country but you know what? I can dig it. This is also reminiscent of Brandon's solo album, kinda makes you want to throw on some cowboy boots and square dance.<br /><br />\\"Battle Born\\" - Here it is, the theme song of the album. It opens with ascending keyboard and guitar. This track is certainly an inspirational anthem. I love the guitar and drums but best of all is the vocals as Brandon reminds us all, we are battle born.<br /><br />Overall BATTLE BORN is a great album, just the return I have been waiting four years for. The Killers are back and in fine form. There are tracks that don't carry the same youthful enthusiasm and impressive scope that I so admire (\\"The Way it Was\\" and \\"Here With Me\\") and I can't stand \\"Heart of a Girl\\" but all in all this is a Grade A album. I highly recommend obtaining the two bonus tracks, \\"Carry Me Home\\" and especially \\"Prize Fighter.\\" If you are among The Victims rest easy, the band is back together and making music just as memorable as ever.iting four years for.

0307931803|5.0|I love this and all the Seuss board books.  They're sturdy enough for my daughter to \\"read\\" by herself and short enough that I have a shot at actually getting through the story before she rips it from my hands.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is the best game ever for anyone who loves the outdoors and who is just passing the time away this game is definitely different from the original
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love, love, love Pinterest! This is something that you wonder how you've lived without it your entire life. The ideas are so great for just about every aspect of your life!
0575099038|5.0|I loved the book as a whole but enjoyed the saga of the slave bridge carriers the most (and the opening assassination sequence of which I hungered for more about the assassin than is present later in the book). The hardest part is waiting and hoping for the next part. Normally, I listen to books to get the full effect but this book is 2 credits at audible!.<br /><br />My only reservation is the ending and if the next part is done as well as the first that will fix itself.
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|Mainly the movie is, see wolf, run like hell. But you can't outrun a wolf. No attempt to make weapons from<br />the downed plane wreckage, no attempt at defense. Complaining about food? Then why run and sap yourself even<br />more? Food sources were right there all along. The wolves.<br /><br />No character development. No survival tactics at all. You couldn't have a worse bunch of \\"survivors\\".<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and avoid this travesty.
B008Y2WEFU|5.0|The end of season 2 was a shocker to my husband and I. Can't believe that Jimmy was shot by Nucky.

B006GHA9VQ|5.0|This stunningly beautiful sequel to The Phantom of the Opera is amazing. I usually do not like recordings of live productions because it takes away the spectator's freedom to look at a particular part of the scene. However, even though the camera focuses on what it wants the spectator to see, the story does not change, and it is a truly touching one. The same characters are back with the addition of Gustave, Christine's son. The mystery of who his father is brings to light all kinds of secrets- the most important one being the never dying love that the Phantom still has for Christine and her struggle to realize that she might have made the wrong decision ten years ago. This is a must see!
B00628RVV0|5.0|Best movie ever, but very disturbing. Amazing from another perspective, the children. A movie you can only watch once because it's so heavy, but worth every cent.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Quell is great app for the kindle fire decent amount of levels tonkeepnthe player entertained for hours. Would recommend this game to any one who likes pyshic puzzle games
0807014273|5.0|A WONDERFUL BOOK BY AN AMAZING MAN. I JUST RECEIVED FIVE COPYS WHICH WILL MAKE A TOTAL OF ELEVEN. I GIVE THEM TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. THIS BOOK CAN CLEAR YOUR SOUL OF ANGER AND HATE AND HELP YOU TO LIVE YOUR LIFE BETTER EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE.

B0087HT36U|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! It's better than angry birds for sure. I thought I was addicted to that game lol
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Ive seen some of the negative reviews people have put on here and I really don't see what the hell they're talking about. How could anyone say this isn't heavy or they need to hang it up. No, it's not as good as Pantera but hell, nothing will ever be as good as Pantera so people need to stop comparing all the members of this band to their other bands like Pantera and Mudvayne. They're not trying to sound like their other bands. Anyway, the album in my opinion is their best to date. I really like it.
B0089ZEEYG|2.0|Down The Hatch is yet another tilt game, the object of which is to navigate Stinky the imp down random backgrounds while eating everything in his path and avoiding enemies. There are of course power ups, health restores, and objects in the game to spice it up a bit - something that almost all title games have.<br /><br />I can't do my standard review on this game because I would put everything in the \\"bad\\" category. I found the music and sound absolutely terrible (the constant fart sounds don't help either), but my three year old daughter thought it was \\"funny\\" and \\"fun\\". It kept her busy while she ate and in the car ride to daycare. That is quite an accomplishment - only done before by Angry Birds and a few other games.<br /><br />The graphics are nice enough, and so are the animations, but there is no real oomph to the game. Everything is overly cute and even the enemies have oversized eyes. The game caters to a much younger demographic.<br /><br />I also found the endless falling on each level to be incredibly boring, with very little changes, and too much repetition. Once again my daughter enjoyed it, so my point is moot.<br /><br />I don't like that this game requires two network permissions in a game the targets children.<br />\\"Open network sockets\\" gives this app free range Internet access, and the aptly named \\"Access information about networks\\" allows it to do exactly that.<br />I am afraid that at any point they will add some more links to the game (there are already two - the \\"News\\", and link to the developers web page) that will allow your child to purchase other games from the developer, or worse - IAP.<br />My daughter's tablet is rooted, and I installed quite a bit of protective software on there. I also password protected her WiFi, but the above is still a concern.<br /><br />There are also a few (VERY obviously) fake five star reviews on the Amazon page. This kind of practice is despicable.<br /><br />Scores:<br />The game: 3/5.<br />Permissions: 2/5(Single player games do NOT need network permissions, especially ones that are targeting children).<br />Combined score: 2.5/5, since Amazon doesn't allow half a star, I will rate a 2/5 (docking a bit because of the fake reviews).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Down The Hatch is certainly worth the free download as today's FAOTD. As for the .99 asking price? I am not so sure. There are plenty of other games to entertain your kids with, and a lot of those don't have all the nasty network permissions of this one.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dylan, along with a superb band, has put out another great collection. Some listeners will find at least one negative in that there are a few long songs here.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought that the book was really creative and inspiring. I read the book twice and i recommend it for everyone. I can't wait for The House of Hades to come out. -_-
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I really struggled to finish this book. It's terribly written, the story is not well thought out and seems rushed.  It reads as if it's written by a very young and clumsy author.
0345803485|4.0|i was a quarter of the way through this book before i could pull myself away long enough to check out the reviews.  i wondered what everyone else thought about the heavily repeated interjections.  imagine my surprise when i found such a huge number of 1-star reviews, nearly all of them dedicated to that one problem!<br /><br />most of us are bothered by the same things.  before i trained myself to ignore them, i worried that i would find a smirk, a flush, a murmur, a jeez, a reference to christian's hotness, an oh my and holy excrement of some kind all in one paragraph and suffer a terminal conniption fit.  i hope the author will take note and stop doing that.  many reviewers couldn't make themselves finish the book because of this huge flaw.  (as an aside, i was also becoming annoyed by \\"two can play this game\\" and \\"i know/wonder where this is going\\".  popped up a little too often, they did.  had it not been for the others, i might not have noticed.  james also seems to be unaware of the definition of the word \\"clamber\\".)<br /><br />i must give james credit for one thing in terms of word usage.  it is rare to find a writer who knows that there's no such thing as a chaise lounge.  the term is chaise LONGUE, french for \\"long chair\\".  it is easy to see how people make the mistake, but i'm glad james got it right.<br /><br />now.  the story.  fifty shades of grey is one of the sexiest, most romantic tales i've read in quite a while.  unlike the 1-star raters, i find this to be a very well written book with finely drawn characters and a really good story line.  i see nothing wrong with the names of the characters or the british tone of some of the words and phrases.<br /><br />watching this romance unfold is a pleasure.  i adore christian.  i am a bit less enthusiastic about anastasia, but that's probably because, as the teller of the tale and, thus, the user of all the jeezes and such in the narrative, she sort of sets herself up for criticism by making the character appear to be silly and immature.  which brings us to that first person present business.  not good.  not good at all.  i don't care for first person as a way of telling a story, but i'll put up with it.  many excellent stories have been written that way.  add present tense, however, and the story has a \\"this is happening right now and i am telling it to you as it happens, even though i'm busy being heavily involved in it as it occurs\\" sort of feel.  again, not good.<br /><br />i do love the inner ladies.  they are entertaining and feisty.  one of them even gave somebody the finger.  what a hoot!<br /><br />this book was sorely in need of a good editor, as so many of you have pointed out.  no editor worth her reading glasses would have let this go to print in its current condition.  once i was into the love story enough that the interjections didn't matter anymore, i allowed myself to pay attention to where those words appeared and what they were meant to do.  the one thing they have in common is that every one of them could have been omitted without causing the slightest bit of harm to the story.  clearly, in fact, their omission would have been a vast improvement.<br /><br />i just got the second in the trilogy and for the moment it seems that the jeezes have been minimized.  one can only hope.  at least christian's \\"sculptured\\" lips have been properly identified as \\"sculpted\\".  in this one change, i see promise.<br /><br />whatever happens, i intend to finish the series.  this is good stuff.
0061673730|1.0|This book is utter junk it is not even written properly the grammar is appalling and a simple sentence is made into a major trial to read. No wonder so many publishers rejected this book it is so poorly written. It is only utter junk half way through because no matter how I tried I could not read more than half the book.Even the story is all over the show,that is when I have deciphered WHAT the author is trying to write down.The standard of English display is that of an 8yr old. Not worth a penny.Fit for the rubbish bin only.Total and utter crap.
0470876417|5.0|For me, this was a piece of the puzzle that I have been searching for for most of my career as an entrepreneur, and as someone who teaches entrepreneurship. Many people understand the various pieces of a business, but their interrelationship is difficult to articulate. The Business Model Canvas not only provides a clear way of thinking, but also it helps us understand how to test and validate our assumptions.    I will be teaching classes at two universities this year and this book will be required reading for the undergraduate and graduate levels. Other books on the list include [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]] and  [[ASIN:0984999302 The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company]]    Also, as long as I'm plugging books, I might as well plug my own: [...]    Another very nice thing about this book it how easy it is to understand. LOTS of great pictures and diagrams make it simple to digest and an easy read. You don't have to read it cover to cover before it's useful and important. I have the diagram on my wall.    Don't miss his additional material on testing value propositions: [...]  Thank you for reading my review!
1609611543|5.0|Since there are already over 500 reviews, I doubt I can add anything that hasn't been said before, so I'll make it short and sweet.  I thought the book was a very interesting read other than the chapter that is about the history of wheat.  I found that to be dry so I skipped it.  Overall, it's one of the best books I've read this year.  Basically, the health issues it touches upon include diabetes, heart disease, skin issues, and mental issues.  With how common those problems are, I think this book could touch a lot of people's lives if they are open to it.<br />I actually bought this book for my mom (but I read it first) and she finds it to be a good read as well.  We are going to share it with my grandma.  It's just one of those books that you want to share with the people you care about.  I highly recommend this.  My only caveat besides the one boring chapter is the diet recommendations.  Obviously he does not recommend wheat, and the gluten free starchy wheat substitutes.  But it seems like there is an anything -goes attitute towards other food.  With how many people are sensitive to other things (like egg or dairy) I think there should have been way more emphasis on being a detective and finding out what works for you.  I know I can't substitute wheat for cheese like the author does, and there's no way I'm the only one.<br /><br />**Update** So the earlier part was written right afterwards.  Now for some results: My mom just gave up beer and bread, not popcorn, rice, or other starches.  Occasionally she would eat wheat but almost totally cut it out.  4 months later, she no longer tested prediabetic.  She never ate sweets and nothing made a difference until cutting out most wheat.  She had borderline-high blood pressure and it's been normalized.  Nothing else has worked this well, and she wasn't even totally following the plan.  We were amazed, and so was our family practitioner.  She also quickly lost a few pounds from the diet right from the get-go.  I lost alittle weight as well, but haven't been sticking to it.  My transition was a little bumpier, so we'll see how that goes.  The only other thing I can report is that I noticed I do get indigestion from too much wheat, so I believe I have a mild or medium sensitivity to it.  I'll update more when the time comes.<br /><br />***Update 2*** I finally buckled down with giving up wheat for good about 2 months ago.  I felt way more self control with my appetite very soon afterwards and lost 5 pounds without exercise.  The bad thing is that I slacked and ate a lot of rice noodles in the last week, and felt gross.  So going wheat free really isn't enough, the gluten free substitutes are pretty bad.  The book says that, but I thought it would be ok to eat that stuff temporarily as a transition.  I'm going to end that transition soon because it's definitely not good.
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|Easy to pick up, simple gameplay.  Fun challenging stages separate the content into chunks in this endless runner style game.  Unique friendly art style.  Like the music, too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|so happy that there is finally a pinterest app for the fire! ive waited forever! very easy to use! get it!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Always loved this movie and now I am so glad it is on blu-ray. The picture quality is amazing. I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|If you really enjoy senseless violence without apparent accountability, for the supposed heroes if not the \\"bad guys\\", read this book. Or imagine marvel comic books without the tongue-in-cheek wit. The plot is juvenile. The carnage is numbing. Bleah!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|As a former semi-audiophile I have always had semi-high end audio gear and I had a hard time making the transition to portable digital audio. I think I have finally found a good compromise with these Sony MDR7506 phones. First of all, I import all my music with a lossless codec (file size be damned). I do not need every recording I own on my player at the same time. And I have always felt that when listening to music I want to hear the music as it was recorded and not the device that is producing the sound. The headphones (or the speakers) should be transparent. To a large extent these Sony phones accomplish that. They have exceptional clarity and detail through all frequency ranges with a natural organic sound and minimal coloration.  And when I can hear the picks on the strings and the rosin on the bows, I know I am in the right place. I also find them comfortable for extended wear and like that the cord is coiled and not too long. I cannot imagine anything much better in this price range and would recommend these without reservation.
B007MG360G|2.0|played about 10mins. it was fun but a screen popped up saying you had to buy full version to go further... boo,boo!!!!

B009157BWU|3.0|I happen to like primates and viewed the film just because of my interest in primate interaction. For most adult audiences the film is a bit too ? childish perhaps. I enjoyed it and found the camera work to be outstanding.
B0089ZEEYG|2.0|It's actually not fun at all. Tilt controls are a gimmick, not game making. All you do is fall and aim for food. Might be fun for a small child, from the 1980's. These other reviews seem to scream fake five star rank reviews.
B007XELMO4|5.0|We love the Cotton Carrier Strap Shot - Backpack Add-on.  We had been searching for the perfect way to carry our camera when backpacking or doing day hikes.  This device was perfect.  It attaches easily to the shoulder strap of any backpack and is easy to get to when you come across that perfect picture.  The camera is carried close to your body so it isn't bouncing or swinging around or in the way when trying to hike trails, climb rocks or forge rivers.<br /><br />We have used it on our Multiday backpack, day hike backpack as well as our camelback pack when doing a long bike ride.  It works beautifully. We would highly recommend this add on.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I will admit, I never gave Fiona a chance due to the timing of her 1st album. It was during an era  where I had enough of record executives trying to ping the next big  \\"Alanis Morissette\\". I refused to buy into her hype. Turned out to be a HUGE mistake and loss for me. After hearing this album,  I had to  rush play catch up on her past works. It's so refreshing to watch an artist evolve. She truly uses music as a form of artistic expression. She could've easily put out what is considered \\"hot\\" for the moment and rode that gravy train to the bank. Yet, she stuck true to her nature and put out a masterpiece. It's ridiculous how 1 song can have you on a roller-coaster of emotions within the first 2 minutes of the song.  Fiona is the definition of musical genius.  This album is simply beautiful, no other way to describe it.<br /><br />As of September 18th, 2012-I can easy say this is the BEST album of the year. Period.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|This cover has worked extremely well. It's attractive, and -- don't look at like like I'm crazy -- has a smooth pleasant feel. I've also used it to prop my Fire up to watch shows and movies, and one marathon session of Ghost Hunters. It's served its purpose, and added to the convenience and safety of my device.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't totally aware of the context of this book before I started reading, but everyone was talking about it so I decided I needed to find out what all the hype was about.  Now I am totally addicted!  Interesting story of how people can change.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|it is a very good game for people all ages. the are a good amount of leveals to beat . its. just fun to play
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love this Cd! It's one of my favorite Cd's of all time. \\"All the things she said..all the things she said..\\" Lol..memories. I didn't like their new Cd as much as this one. This CD is classic.. 100%
B00498VFNA|5.0|This is a great album with classical jazz that's so versatile. It works while studying, cooking, sleeping, entertaining and etc. His music is sophisticated and soulful. Gotta love Duke!
1401937519|5.0|It intrigues me how a progression of books will inevitably lead me to THE book that I was meant to read. This is THE book! I don't even remember what caught my eye or why I read the synopsis of it because the book jacket or title wouldn't have been enough for me to even consider it. 'Something' drew me to it and for whatever reason my brain said, \\"I need to read this!\\" I will forever be grateful. It validated all sorts of feelings & beliefs that I already had swirling around inside me. Life works in mysterious ways.
0307341550|4.0|Second book I read from Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />I think she is immensely talented, and though this book was a debut, it was full of atmosphere and depth.  The book ended on just the right note.  She took an used cliché, and gave it a nice spin.<br /><br />Reporter Camille Preaker returns to her hometown to explore a series of murders.  She meets her wild half-sister, and reunites with her mystifying creepy family, consisting of her emaciated well-groomed stepfather, and seemingly charming mother.  There are plenty of suspects and players, and villains and friends can be one in the same.  What she uncovers confirms what she had always known in her heart.  I loved the ending.<br /><br />If I had one quibble, I wish there had been even more about her mother and half-sister at the end.<br /><br />The book is well constructed and very nicely written.  I was very entertained.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has received a lot of attention from Gone Girl, probably the least satisfying and definitely my least favorite of her books.  This book is better.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It's very good. What more can one say? That's why it's called a classic. Thanks to Amazon for offering this book.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|Like the STAR WARS and ALIEN sets before this, the cardboard pages that hold the discs (no matter what shiney $&!% they coat them with) scratch them.  Anything on the disc or caught inside the cheap a$$ folded cardboard WILL SCRATCH THE DISC!  But, once again I'll have to go through set after set trying to get good copies.  Once again I have to buy my own blu ray cases so the set I spent so much money on will last more than one viewing.<br />  The movies are great.  The transfers are great.  But all that work and quality just goes down the toilet when greedy companys use this cardboard crap.  Why is it that the more popular the series, the more likely it is the studio will pull this on us?  $50 to $100 not enough profit on films already made and paid for at the box office to give us durable cases?  Or is it part of the plan to wreck physical media, force us into downloads, and take away our ability to own the things we pay for.<br />  As I said before, the quality of the blu rays are exceptional.  Any fan of John Williams iconic score will be delighted with the HD audio mix.  Even though the picture quality is the best ever, it does seem like they tweeked the contrast levels to be more in line with contemporary films.  Good luck getting your scratchless copies so you can enjoy the work that went into them.<br />  5 out of 5 for the discs.  0 out of 5 for packaging.  2 1/2 out of 5 average.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I spend hours on it. I look up all different kinds of food and crafts. I also love all the jokes.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it. this is a terrific game. my kids love it too. I wish it were longer but my daughter plays it over and over.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This album is just captivating. The best tracks were thinkin bout you, super rich kids, pyramids, forrest gump, pink matter, and bad religion.<br />If you don't like this album, then you're a hipster and don't want to follow the hype. This kind of hype is actually good.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Huge fan - one of few series I always pre-order at full retail for my Kindle.  Child often had Reacher wandering in America's heartland and in some previous works, Child overworked the setting.  From NYC, it appeared that everyone west of the Hudson and east of the San Gabriels was a drooling, evil, twisted sadist with a double-digit IQ.  Child seems to have gotten things in balance for this book, and while there is not much by way of bone crunching and neck snapping, Reacher is still a crafty warrior handing out appropriate justice.<br /><br />Some good characters and an interesting plot, but then I am not especially rational when it comes to the Reacher series.  I just plain like the character and look forward to the next novel.<br /><br />It ain't Tolstoy - thank god.
B0034G4P26|5.0|Rented this for my 3-year old son, not really expecting much.  My husband did not want to sit through it at all.  Popped it in thinking my son might like it and I would suffer through.  Boy was I wrong.  Clay-mation is not really my thing but it did not deter from the fact that this movie was hilarious.  Great humor for adults and kids alike.  My son watched the whole movie and barely got sidetracked which is a great feat for a 3-year old.  My husband came in about 1/2 way through and even he got sucked in.  Good fun!
B0050DZN4K|1.0|Based on the reviews this looked like the app to rule the Google Reader UI.<br /><br />Sadly it does not work on the Kindle Fire HD.  It runs up, but does not allow you to login to any service, simply sitting there spinning its wheels on the \\"Logging in\\" section.<br /><br />Very poor show.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I had read The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini, and I was skeptical that the author could write another novel as outstanding as his first one.  Nevertheless, A Thousand Splendid Suns is absolutely splendid. Ha. Ha.  The story is told from the point of view of two very different girls who become women as the book progresses.  Mariam is the rather homely, illegitimate child of a wealthy business man.  She was raised in a tiny hovel by her mother who was the man's housekeeper.  Mariam rarely sees her father and misses him terribly.<br /><br />Laila is a beautiful, well educated daughter of university professor.  Although, she is somewhat overshadowed by her two older brothers, she is loved and cared for by both parents.  Her father is a forward thinker who tells her that education is important, and she is destined to do great things if she continues her education.<br /><br />The women's paths cross as the result of a tragic, life changing event.<br /><br />This is an heart-wrenching and thought provoking book with many references to Afghanistan's history.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|great in everything. exceptionally done. love the narrator, all of the actors, and the director nailed every suspenseful moment perfectly
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoyed all the games. They are awesome.  Unlocking games are the best and fun way to play. Although some games were hard to play. It's fun though.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This series is amazing. Great character development, compelling conflict, and fast paced action. Brandon Sanderson has demonstrated many times in the past that he is not afraid to kill off characters so you really feel the tension as this conflict comes to a head and the true enemy of the world is revealed. Every bad guy in this series is well done and Ruin is no exception. Couldn't put it down.
B00005AQE8|3.0|This was the first full album of 2pac I listened to. Disc 1 is sequentially perfect and every song compliments each other well. The most stand out track on Disc 1 is California Love. I greatly anticipated that song the very first time I listened to this album. The anticipation of that song made me appreciate the tracks prior to that. I Ain't Mad At Cha and What'z Ya Phone # were good follow up songs to California Love on Disc 1. Disc 2 leaves a lot to be desired. U Can't C Me is a garbled mess, Thug Passion is a weak song, Picture Me Rollin' and Check Out Time are really forgettable, Run Tha Streets is also a weak song, and Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find is not a strong close out song like Outlaw was on Me Against The World. If this album were 2 separate albums, then Disc 2 would be one of the worst albums ever. Disc 2 has some good songs on it as well, but the disc is not good to listen to in its entirety like Disc 1 and Me Against The World. All Eyez On Me is an album to keep one eye open and the other eye closed to!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I never got a chance to see them live and I must say that this DVD deffinately did the trick. I have always been a directioner (well since they started) and I am in love with all of them. They all get equal screen time and you even get to see JOSH DEVINE :) I have to admit I screamed while watching it. Haha if you like this watch A Year In The Making. You will love it! Love you directioners :)xxx
B0034G4P94|5.0|I've seen this film numerous times at a theatre, even though there were little to no publicity during its screenings.  With all that is said and done here: for fight fans, MMA fans, or just fans of brilliant acting from an amazing, talented cast with a true-to-life story filled with intense, raw emotions this is the BEST, if not the only, action film to own in your collection...far and above the highly nominated \\"The Fighter\\".  A definite must see and must own!
1451673442|5.0|I never thought I would be so relaxed, happy, able to take things in stride and see the positive in ALMOST everyone and every situation. I still need work. But this little book and the simple ideas it lays out do work like magic.<br />  Thank You, Thank You, Thank You.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love the graphics and calming music. Peaceful while making me think outside the box. Also love the idea of the antique look.
1451627297|4.0|This is a mind-blowing read in terms of the possibilities raised and the repercussions presented when dealing with time travel. A compelling story told only as Stephen King could tell it, with a little bit of mystery mixed with romance, adventure and the occasional chill. The story is compelling and the book is a page turner. I couldn't help but think as I read this that King doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of all of the implications of the butterfly effect and what would happen if one went back in time and interacted with even just one person. King seems to opt for the easy, predictable ending; I must say I half expected something a bit more twisted. Instead, his ending borders on the sweet and poignant, contributing to an overall feel good and more than satisfactory reading experience.
0385341008|4.0|I must admit that this is not the type of book I would ordinarily read if not for it being a pick for a bookclub I just joined.  I'm more into reading more mainstream popular  authors such as Patterson, Grisham, Sparks, etc .  When I first took a look at a few pages and discovered that the story is told in letters I cringed!  I actually re-read the first 25 pages after I had finished the book because I tend to miss things at the beginning of books that don't have an immediate impact on me.  I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the book.  It's interesting that this particular letter style really lends itself to feel the various emotions of its characters, from a chuckle to sadness.  Overall, reading this has piqued my curiosity to other authors and book that I don't typically read.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|This rates right up there as one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's got it all - drama, romance, thrilling high-speed jet chasing scenes and great humor (\\"You've lost that lovin' feeling\\" was a great scene).  Tom Cruise plays \\"Maverick\\", a hot-dogging jet pilot who makes it to Top Gun flight school even though he breaks almost all the rules.  I have a Dolby 7.1 surround system and the 6.1 Master Audio (DTS Digital Surround) format of the movie produces some incredibly realistic sounds from the back and sides.  It feels like you are in the theater, or better yet, like you are right there in the movie itself.  Made in 1986, it brings back a lot of great memories!
B000001Y2U|5.0|It's been at least a decade since I bought this album, after discovering Nine Inch Nails. Since that time I've traced back their influences, through Skinny Puppy, Einsteurzende Neubauten, Adam Ant, back to the grandaddies of them all, Suicide, Throbbing Gristle, David Bowie. I've heard everything the industrial genre has to offer and this album still sounds fresh in every way to my jaded ear.<br /><br />The first Manson albums reflect a combination of Trent Reznor's formidable production with the first big ideas of Marilyn himself. The musicians are talented, the songs are musically original, the production and sampling are first rate, the emotion and depth of the songs is impeccable.<br /><br />Marilyn spins this as a concept album with references to Nietzsche and Ayn Rand, about some character that is not himself, but the ruse is transparent. These songs are autobiographical in pornographic detail. Someone who has had a relationship with someone severely emotionally disturbed will relate painfully well to Tourniquet. Someone who has left a disgusting backwoods town to realize himself will have Man That You Fear as their anthem. Someone who has been stomped on in their quest for happiness and bootstraps themselves back up through the furious realization that their only savior is in the mirror will resonate with every second of The Reflecting God.<br /><br />There's a lot of unhealthy psychological baggage in here that Marilyn unpacks and analyzes in a very public way. Some of this is extremely cathartic. There will be times in your life that are hard, your eyes will open and you will see one of these songs in a new light, and realize that this man is another flawed but restless traveler, earnestly searching for answers.<br /><br />This is the best workout album.
B000NIVJGI|4.0|One of my wife's favorite movies of all time.  Done beautifully in Blu Ray.  It's great to see \\"Lenny\\" (Jerry Orbach) from Law & Order in the role of Jennifer Grey's dad.  Patrick Swayze is a great dancer and the music from the movie is tremendous.  Made in 1987, it brings back those days like they were only yesterday.  If you liked it originally you will love it in Blu-ray.

B004L9MFM2|4.0|A great continuation from the first book, just as entertaining and intriguing, very glad I read it. Haven't kept up to date with the TV series, but now am very keen to go back and watch it, especially with the additional details I know from reading this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First heard about this book on the The View. Woopie you were right. It held my interest all the way through.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|'Combo\\" made me think there would be 2 separate discs.  Upon receiving I discovered the Blu-ray is on one side and the regular DVD is on the other of the same disc.  Not that it is a problem, just didn't expect that.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First of all as a Army Vet I understand why people would dislike this book when it was first printed. I was one of those. Even though I was upset that the book was written I decided to give the book a shot and read it. Here is a couple of things that I noticed.<br /><br />The book is not the best written book, so if your looking to read a book with \\"big words\\" to make you feel more intelligent, this is not the book for you. Its written at level that all people can read. For this I give it a high rating, this book can be enjoyed by not only a seasoned reader but a young teenager who dreams of one day defend our country. Lets face it folks hes a SEAL not an AUTHOR, and YES YES I understand he had a co-writer, but if the book read slow and boring I would have tossed this book across the room.<br /><br />The book is a AutoBio. So no the book is not all about the mission to capture Osama Bin Laden. So if you expect to read a book full of action gun fights and video game action, this is not the book for you. I'm glad. He explains his history with his dad and how much he wanted to become a SEAL, many people have given the book a bad review because of this but HELLO PEOPLE its an AUTO BIO. Read the Title.. sheesh!<br /><br />He didnt compromise the United States in any way. The only thing that he made clear is the reason why the shots where taken to take OBL out. Again as a Soldier, I completely agree with the actions taken. READ THE BOOK to understand WHY! Many people have to make tough choices including our service men and women, police officers, and many others. PLEASE read the book and put yourself in the shoes of the SEALS and see why the decision was made.<br /><br />Fellow readers read it, enjoy it, see the life of a SEAL from a first person view and not what you read on the news or what the Media decides to tell you. I am glad he shared his point of view and I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />Good Readings :)
B000HCO83Q|3.0|This product was received in the \\"shape\\" as promised; however, when I viewed the movie, it paused, froze up and upon review of the item when I removed it from my dvd player it appeared to have some scratches.  The product was new I removed all the protective coverings myself; however, the product was defective.
B005J4TLN4|3.0|I wasn't expecting very much from this movie so I was a bit surprised that it got better as it went along. And I do enjoy the fact that films set in England cannot automatically rely on GUNS for all of the killing action. When the kids scatter to their apartments to get armed for the fight...........in the US they'd have assault weapons or at least a variety of hand guns. Here they must rely on baseball bats, swords, chains, gas filled (spoiler alert) super soakers, knives & yes, a few hand guns. The aliens were creepy & surreal -- like shaggy puppies with wicked fangs. And unlike most Alien movies, these critters are vulnerable & not that bright. Good at mindless killing but stoppable. I was surprised at the level of tension that was created in the various face-offs between monsters & kids, monsters & adults, kids and other badder kids, cops & everyone else. The opening sequence drags along too much but it sets the stage for the rest of the action. An interesting shout out to PBS style Nature shows too. Funny that. I did have a bit of a struggle with the cockney accent.........say what?!  But after awhile the dialogue wasn't really needed to enjoy the action. So really.....3 1/2 Stars overall. And yeah -- different rendering of \\"what if\\" by landing the Aliens in a crowded urban setting instead of a desert, ocean, small town or other more isolated setting. Good idea fairly well presented.
B000SEIDR0|2.0|\\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is my least favorite book by Pollan to date -- and, after reading this book, I'm not sure I'll attempt another of his in the future. My disappointment mostly comes from the extremely weak and cursory ending -- in fact, I wish I had stopped reading the book two-thirds of the way in. The sections comprising the first two-thirds of the book -- covering corn production and \\"grass farming\\" (i.e., animal farming) -- were both interesting and informative. The last section of the book was more personal, and held less interest for me. Here Pollan covers his personal experiences experimenting with vegetarianism, hunting for wild boar, and foraging for mushrooms. This all culminates into what he calls \\"the perfect meal\\" -- an entirely unrealistic and completely symbolic undertaking consisting of foraged and hunted foods.<br /><br />My main complaint is that Pollan's arguments against animal rights were superficial -- as someone familiar with issues surrounding animal rights, I feel that his treatment of the topic was very shallow. For this reason, I wish that he hadn't devoted an entire chapter to the topic, as he certainly didn't give it his due. Also, I found a few instances in this book that cited statistics that are incorrect.<br /><br />He ends the book with no real strong conclusions, except for perhaps \\"eat local\\". I really was expecting more.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|It was a wonderful reprieve from the week of work. My wife, 17-year-old daughter, and I thoroughly enjoyed the flick. Very artfully done. The story was fun and the message is a good one for us all. Take a break and see it!
1455121924|5.0|This book seems to make good sense.  The author is well versed in research on nutrition and health.  If he is accurate on his findings, it is valuable and vital to the health of people.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great helped me pass time when I was working 11-7. I recommend everyone to download this game
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|Words cannot describe how awesome this album is Amon Amarth bring it and have been bringing it since they released Once Sent From The Golden Hall in 1998. I discovered AA on Fate Of Norns which is also a great album but once I heard this epic peace of beauty I knew this band is godly. Johan Hegg growls like no other and you can feel his emotion when he growls the twin guitar attack of Johan Soderberg and Olavi Mikkonen are one of my favorites in all of metal. The drumming of Fredrik Andersson and the bass playing of Ted Lundstrom help make the album complete. Standout tracks include War Of The Gods, Destroyer Of The Universe, Doom Over Dead Man, A Beast Am I, and The Last Stand Of Frej anybody who loves Amon Amarth will love this album essential to any metalheads collection.
