B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show hooks you right away and you can't stop.  My wife and I burned through the first season in three nights.
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|It could have been written in less than 50 pages. Just too many testimonials  and reiterating for my taste. It could have even been a pamphlet
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This amazing game has exceptional graphics and a meditative soundtrack. But do not allow the Zen ambiance lull you into any false notion that this will be an easy go.<br /><br />The levels start relatively simple then escalate rapidly to more and more complex challenges. While some games make you want to give up because of a seemingly contrived construct to an eventually impossible to solve level, Quell Reflect allows you to earn coins along the way which can be used to buy solutions that not only solve the level you are stuck on, but in doing so it trains you in some creative techniques.<br /><br />Buy this App and start exercising your brain and expanding your mind. You will not regret this purchase!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|i like it's color, it' not easy to be dirty. it's also convenient to fold when you watch video on it.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|Bridge Constructor Playground was a great free app of the day! And to the people who said you can't get out of a tutorial where lying because you need to finish the island tutorial to get out of it! You play and construct bridges and see if trucks and/or cars could go over it without falling or the bridge breaking. You can earn badges for that level and you have lots of different materials to use! If you could get it for free it would probably be 5x better and I was just lucky and got it free. I would especially suggest it for 4-10 year olds to play! If you get this app I hope you enjoy it!
B000EXZI0A|4.0|It's my favorite disk, I will probably wear it out and to buy a new one, but take this review thing and shove it!!!
B007FIY3VW|1.0|i bought this so I could edit a Powerpoint and it crashes everytime I try to open it from the tootle drive so when I tried to make a new Powerpoint, there wasn't even an option to do so! ripoff!
B00005JGAF|5.0|Love the Ramones, my favorite Punk band!!  They are a must for any decent Punk Rock Collection,  Hell, they started the movement in NYC!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|i really like it so will you wont b no regretz i asure yu dat. entertaining long amazingly funny game . of speed
B009X01FJS|5.0|love this case.it does exactly what it says . just close to turn off open to turn off revolving feature is great i can stand it in portrait to read landscape for movie watching .highly recommend.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Like others I first saw Macklemore and Ryan Lewis on NPR's Tiny Desk Concert.  I was blown away by Mack's charisma, earnestness and ambition.  I did not expect to like the whole album...but I did.  There is an honesty and integrity to this music that is rare.  I am now a huge fan--I hope their message reaches far and wide.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|My kids love this app. Easy to use. Even my five year old can play it. Keeps them busy for hours.
0375851569|5.0|This is my 3rd or 4th purchase of these books.  They make a great gift for kids of all ages, but are really fun for kids who are learning to read.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|i liked this because i like stories based on true events.i found this a gripping family story.i loved it! great flick!
B006M4RN3U|2.0|I dont normally write reviews for music since it is hard to judge something artistic like this. I did want to let everyone know that this does not feel cohesive. It feels like two seperate bands threw songs together on one album. Half of the album is a softer music like their release of We are young. The other half is all audio tuned songs. I am not a fan of Audio tune and if I had known so much of the music was like this I would not have wasted the money on the entire album.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This a very interesting journey into the understanding of motivation. It is a must for each of us, as social beings.
B004WOH18E|3.0|While I enjoyed reading it, I thought there weren't enough twists in the plot. The collateral damage was not relevant to the storyline.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Title says it all.  I hope season 4 will get back to the groups survival against the walkers and trying to find a suitable safe haven now that their group has tripled in size.  Still a bit perplexed as to how they seem to be going 100 mph, but going nowhere.  Why not leave the state, go to the coast, etc?
B0011E9LBI|3.0|It was OK. Just wasn't fantastic. Sound especially was just so so. But it was what I ordered so it was OK.
067960085X|5.0|I had never read the book.  I loved the film, mainly because it is romantic.  The book has it romantic parts, sort of, but is brighting and gritty.  So much was changed from the book to the film that it made my imagination to tail spins. This isn't a criticism and I really get tired of the cliche &#34;Books are always better than the movie&#34;.  Not so, I feel.  Because they are different modalities of expression.  Both methods of story telling encourage your imagination in different ways.<br />Breakfast at Tiffany's is thoughtfully written, wonderfully constructed and real.(the Book, that is.)<br />I highly suggest readers who have not read it to do so.<br />Re: Amazon.  My experiences with ordering things through Amazon has always been positive and I thank you folks at Amazon for the prompt service. ... R. Moyer
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is one of my most favorite authors.  I love the whole Outlander series and am re-reading it for the 4th time in anticipation of her newest novel due out in the fall of this year.  I highly recommend starting out with Outlander and reading the whole series.
B005LAIISA|1.0|The video kept freezing up. I checked and there is one major scratch that I couldn't fix even after cleaning the disc 3 times. I never got past 37 minutes of this video so I can't comment on the movie itself. I would not buy from this seller again.
B00005JN4H|5.0|This was so entertaining.  I rarely watch a comedy that makes me laugh out loud.  Some bring a smile to my face, but this was really funny.  If you like comedy suggest you buy.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|The uses for this cable are very limited for what you are paying.  Another example of Apple fleecing the public.  There  should be one standard cable/connections for ipods, ipads, iphones, and computers to other devices (cameras, printers, etc).  While on it, it took Apple forever to make it possible to connect a laptop computer to a HDTV to watch Netflix with a mini display port thunderbolt.  I had to buy a new laptop to do it. My 2 yr old laptop would connect but the sound came only through the computer so I had to hook up speakers to the computer to hear a movie on Netflix.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|No instruments. Only oral music. If you like beatbox and pure voice. This will be a very good choice. Strongly<br />recommend
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app works great for me! I love staying connected where ever I am! I would recommend it to anyone!
1439152802|4.0|I should have learned by now - I start all Kate Morton books with a great deal of anticipation only to get bogged down about a hundred pages in by the very slowly developing mystery and shifting time lines. Usually, I set it down only to come back and finish the book in one great gulp as all the plot lines and mysteries come together. By the end, I'm almost heartbroken that it's ended and find myself wishing for more.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper was no different. I was drawn in the main narrator - Laurel, a famous actress in her sixties, facing the death of mother she adored. Laurel and her mother are bound by a horrific event forty years before, an event Laurel has struggled to understand in the context of her mother's life and her own. She starts her own investigation into her mother's past and we're soon flung back into a beautifully recreated Blitz-era London - Morton only needs a song or a slash of red lipstick to bring that world to life. I loved that she somehow managed to make that much-examined era feel fresh and current with the characters' personal problems crowding around - and sometimes crowding out - the larger concerns of war.<br /><br />Back in the current timeline, Morton has also done a better job of integrating real feeling and some deeper observations about love, friendship and parent-child relationships. In her past books, feeling has served second to the mystery but that certainly isn't the case here as in this passage where Laurel sits by the bedside of her dying mother:<br /><br />\\"The previous speech, whatever memories it had brought with it, had tired Dorothy - the wind lost from her sails and she was slumped  now against the cushions....Laurel studied her mother's profile, wishing she had been a different sort of daughter, wishing there was more time, that she could go back and do it all again, not leave everything to the last and find herself sitting at her mother's bed with so many blanks to fill.\\"<br /><br />Morton does a beautiful job of balancing perspectives on characters - I especially loved a chapter late in the novel introducing the reader to the childhood of one of the main protagonists. The writing and imagery in this chapter was gorgeous and yet increased the suspense related to the main plot. Almost everyone in the book has something to hide or has done something morally questionable and yet they were all fascinating, sympathetic people. My main quibble was with the central relationship between Dolly and Vivien - while the book gave reasons for Dolly's obsession with Vivien, I found that element of the book underdeveloped and since this is the main hinge upon which the plot swings, I had to move past that disbelief and accept all that came afterwards.<br /><br />The central mysteries and secrets didn't seem quite as far-fetched as plot twists in other Morton novels and while one plot element I suspected all along did end up happening, I was still engaged until the end. Looking back, I can see that I've reviewed this book based largely on Morton's previous works. Really, that's the only to evaluate this unique author who has built a mini-genre all her own out of shifting plots set in England from about 1880-1940. She'll most likely return to these topics again and again - and because she does such a beautiful job each time, I'll always return!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher for review purposes.of balancing perspectives on characters - I especially loved a chapter late in the novel introducing the reader to the childhood of one of the main protagonists.

B002VWNID6|1.0|Although I love this movie and was psyched for the low price, I was highly disappointed that the DVD seems to only have half of the movie on the disc. One of the other reviewers mentioned flipping the disc over to watch the second half of the movie, haven't tried it and not sure why a movie would even do this! Disappointed in the quality of this.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|Interesting story.  A bit \\"spicy\\" at times.  Wonder how much of it is based on what actually occurred at that time in history.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|With some of the most funky beats ever. Listen to it. Love it. It's a work of beauty. Daft Punk is awesome.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|A must-have for fans of the show! Comes with outtakes and special features. Behind the scenes portion is a hoot!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw Les Miserables in a live performance back in the early 1990's and in the film it was much easier to follow the story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app so much! It is addicting, fun, and it makes your brain work hard. It is really smooth, and the levels are great!!!! Totally worth it!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is a time consuming, procrastination enabling game.  Fun, ads to skip, fun, addictive, simple yet challenging.  Even better because it is free.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|As a mother of two, homemaker, wife, softball cheerleaders, chef, chauffeur, doctor, nurse, stray animal rescuer, and the list is endless.......this has become my great escape from it all when I'm able to hide away. I'm sure many mothers can relate. Absolutely love this game and look forward to having free time to play. Great work, Buffalo Studios!!! Keep the adventure coming.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is so much fun and if you love games and horses this app is for you. I love my horse it's like having your own horse but with less work.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I spent many hours immersed in The Room.  The game works your brain but not to a frustrating level.  When you have a &quot;aha&quot; movement,you are dazzled with the results. A treat for both the mind and the eyes.  This is a game to be savored.  Definitely worth the price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best app ever! I really enjoyed Subway Surfers. I would recommend to anyone. I love this app.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|Testatment hits a home run with \\"Dark Roots of Earth\\". There is just enough guttural vocals to please fans of the last few Testament cd's.  \\"DROE\\" should bring back those who drifted away in the mid 1990's. Track #5 \\"A Day In The Death\\" is worth the price of admission.  Track 6 \\"Cold Embrace\\" will have you thinking \\"Return To Serenity\\".  I hope Testament stays on this path...Can't wait to hear the follow-up to \\"DROE\\".
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I have not heard the CD yet and I am sure that I will like the music some of the songs I have heard are good.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book! It made me smile and I am now 're reading the series. When is house of Hades gonna show up? Well, I know in gall but why not faster?!? I love all of Rick,s  books I haven't looked into the 39 clues books. Maybe I could start that series and while I am reading they get house of Hades done!!!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I liked this film.  It had a good story line and was well acted.  It also taught some good lessons with some humor mixed in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and I never get bored!<br />I have also found that a lot of my friends play this game, and I enjoy that you can own your personal horse!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|I wish I could rate it four and a half stars; I enjoy Lee Child's character Jack Reacher very much and eagerly await his next book. Please ask Lee Child to not sell any more film rights to Tom Cruise. I know many people who refused to go and see the film as it was a travesty to allow Tom Cruise to cast himself and Jack Reacher and do a great disservice to a character which very many people have come to adore. Send Tom on a cruise while more Jack Reacher books get to Lee Child's public. There are many great actors who would do justice to the Jack Reacher character but no film is as good as a book in bringing a character to life in our minds though skilful use of our imaginations and experiences.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is wonderful, and I would recommend it for anybody who thinks that most contemporary music has lost the entrenching, enchanting, engrossing nature that the music of the 70s, 80s, and 90s captured so effortlessly. Daft Punk's masterpiece.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|It has been a few years since I read an Ian Rankin novel featuring the John Rebus character, and it was with fond memories that I embarked on the journey through this book. The very pleasant memories came flooding back and it was a joy to read it was like catching up with a dear old pal who is a bit of a reprobate but who adds a bit of frisson to one's life, good one pal!
B000KI6286|5.0|I gave this movie five stars. Reason being from watching the movie you can tell a lot of thought had been put into it. The main actor is quite the sales men and I believe you can learn a lot about communicating with people by watching this movie.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Another very gritty story from Jo Nesbo I think that to date I have read all of his books and none of them are disappointing in any way. The featured character of Harry Hole is such a believable, flawed character that it is easy for one's imagination to bring the stories to life in one's mind. I have happily recommended his books to many friends and relations and they have been received with universal acclaim.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|When I first heard of Game of Thrones, I was put off-mostly because I hate huge, sprawling, popular series. I also looked up spoilers on wikipedia and was turned off by the incest and darkness. But it's actually not that dark. Yes, major characters die (no one is safe), and the portrayal of historical life is pretty gritty (though more Renaissance than Medieval at times), but it's not gratuitously creepy or horrific. You care about every character whose point of view the story is told in (and there are a lot of pov characters--not to mention they're on conflicting sides). That's talent.<br /><br />For history buffs, this series is based on The War of the Roses (and probably The Hundred Years' War). For TV buffs, there's a pretty awesome series that's now in Season 3. There's also an official Game of Thrones recipe book. That's why I started reading this series. I read the introduction to the cookbook written by George R. R. Martin and realized, &#34;Hey, this guy can actually write,&#34; and gave this series a try. You should too.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Not too simple and lots of game play. One of the better games out there. I appreciate a relaxed and interesting game.<br />Cat
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miz has been one of my favorite musicals for many years.  This version was indeed spectacular!  Go for it!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|author Kevin Hearne uses references from contemporary movies and culture that meld with the knowledge and lifestyle of a 2000 year old Druid.  For example, he tells his dog that he will find the movies he (the dog, Oberon) wants on Netflix.  The book is a humorous adventure tale that made me look up all that old Celtic gods and kings history.  These Celtic gods are just as petty and hardheaded as their worshippers and make great characters as the Druid Atticus moves through the modern era.  Atticus relationship with his beloved Irish wolfhound Oberon convinced me this was my kind of book.  Reading the rest of the book left me entertained, happy and ready for more.  Lucky for me. there is more.  This is apart of a series that I intend to finish.  Much better than wasting my money on a fancy coffee and I can read it again and again.  that is my criteria for a good book.  I look forward to reading a this again and enjoying it just as much
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We're on an extended camping trip and are watching one episode each evening.  If you're hooked on the current series, but haven't seen the first two seasons (or just want to see them again), this set is for you.  Downton Abbey works its way through numerous plot lines, but isn't as frenetic as most American TV shows.
B001QJUX24|5.0|\\"The Searchers\\" is not just Wayne and Ford's best movie together, it is arguably one of the greatest American films ever made. An intelligent script, breathtaking scenery, gorgeous photography, great acting, and a haunting storyline that seems to sum up the Western experience in America.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Addictive inventive and fun very SIM like gameplay and its not that much of a money grabber, you can work to get pretty much everything.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|The Great OZ missed his lines a few times and Disney left them in. ARGH! Great watch and story line.<br /><br />As to format I have several 3D disks with 2D as a play back feature!<br /><br />Quote  \\"\\"Playing back the identical designated single AVC stream (one eyes view) will produce the same actual 2D feature as seen from all the other 2D versions. This version is also combined with a second eyes view making it the 3D versions MVC encode, and is what is making the disc a hybrid Blu-ray 3D + BD disc.<br />i.e. (Only two video streams are on the disc. Both eye views are used for the 3D version and one of them, the common designated stream for 2D)\\"\\"<br />end quote
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love everything about it...I always wanted an alarm clock that would wake me up with the sound of my own music and this does it.....totally worth having..
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|No thanks. Another app I thought would be good but I was wrong again. Sorry friends mothers I  thought. No good.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I think they should make the daily deals better and the game should also have more items that you can buy with the in game coins but otherwise that the game is awesome and easy to understand and can easily take hours off you day.
B008AYA7WE|1.0|This is a waste of time. The tiles don't fall right. It is dumb and a waste of time. STUPID!
B00CEF014E|4.0|I really enjoyed this mini book...wasn't too much of a lengthy committment and a great beach read for my holiday this week. I was drawn to the book by the cover..despite the old saying of never judging a book this way. I finished the story in one sitting poolside and have passed it along to my roommate for her flight home leisure. Relateable in many ways and hard to put down, thanks Amazon!
B007URVZJ6|2.0|This booklet is only for building a very basic book--frontmatter, text, and TOC.  It includes very little about illustrations, nothing about adding footnotes or index, and minimal guidance about prepping a cover.  No direction about *removing* headers/footers and page numbers from a pre-formatted MS Word file--merely advice to not use them.<br /><br />It's okay if you want to put out a purely-text novel, but beyond that, it's pretty weak.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The book had a slow start but thank goodness I didn't stop reading. Great character development and the mysterious plot didn't get resolved until the end! Wonderful book!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|A great option , helps when awaw from home and on long days....plus provides good protection. I covered mine with clear contact paper to ptotect against scratches...
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|We watched Hitchcock last night and were pleasantly surprised by what a great movie this was.  The reviews we read prior to renting were so-so, but my wife and I thought this was a very entertaining film and highly recommend renting it.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|I have never been a huge Whitney Houston fan but there were songs of hers that I liked OK, so when I saw this CD with her best songs on it for the low low price it was, I decided to get it.  I know most of the songs by heart from hearing them on the radio down through the years and I enjoy singing along to this CD in the car.  If you are a huge Whitney fan, you probably already have this CD.  If you like some of her songs but don't consider yourself a major fan, then I would recommend this CD for your listening pleasure.  She did have a beautiful voice and her songs showcase her ability to hit the high notes.  I like this CD and I'm glad I got it. It's the only one of hers that I have and for the cost I am very pleased with it.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Good performances ... definitely kept my interest throughout ... sadder than I expected, so watch out for that. A good look into surfing lore and culture.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I enjoyed Phillip Phillips from the first audition on American Idol that they aired of him. Just listening to those few seconds he belted out &#34;Thriller&#34; and I knew I had my pick for the season and I wasn't wrong. Apparently millions of people enjoyed his sound also. I think what got him the A.I. title wasn't just his originality but his genuine niceness. I was looking forward to his first CD after his A.I. win and I have not been disappointed. He is a unique voice with his own sound.  He wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on this CD and I'm glad they allowed him to showcase his own stuff, because he has his own style and nobody can duplicate him. He's a mix of John Mayer, Joe Cocker, Dave Matthews and a little bit of Eric Clapton but he is own man!. I love this CD and plan to follow his career and keep adding to my collection of his music.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|What a great little movie! My husband and I enjoyed watching this so much and we didn't even have an appropriately aged kid as an excuse :) The production quality and storyline are both wonderful. I can't see anyone not liking this film. Its unique and not predictable with lots of great little nods to classic video games throughout.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of Kelly Clarkson, but it seems like I liked almost every song of hers played on the radio.  So when I found this CD with all her good stuff on it for the low low price it was, I had to get it.  I have enjoyed singing along to it in the car.  Kelly has a smooth voice that can go pop or country and I look forward to hearing more from her in the future.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|sometimes you just need candy floss for the brain - after a killer week it was nice to settle down with this series.  This series does not require any heavy thought process, but very enjoyable.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|If you're a fan of Phantom of the Opera, you will absolutely love this production. Best cast and orchestra ever, filmed in the remarkable Royal Albert Hall. Watch it ASAP!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The writing is somewhat trivial, but a good story underneath. A nice ending to this trilogy. Read all three in a row. Would recommend.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Having read all of Rowling's Harry Potter books numerous times, I wasn't see what to expect from &#34;A Casual Vacancy&#34;. However, it grabbed my attention from the first page and kept me thinking about all the characters straight to the end. A really great read!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|This game is entertaining, thought provoking, engaging and funny. Basically you draw rubber bands to determine the trajectory of a falling jelly fish so that he hits things in a certain order.<br />Very addictive and worth getting.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Ok it is a really point less app but when u start playing it u can't stop I think it is so addicting I love it you should really get this it is a really good time waster the only thing I don't like is if your out of coins you have to wait that's all bye!!!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My daughter has been playing and has loved the app until recently.  For the past week she has been complaining about pop up adds during or after every mini game.  Now the app force closes during the grooming mini game.  She's had fun up until these problems arose but I'm thinking about deleting the app.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great movie, we enjoyed it and it kept us on edge for awhile and then a nice plot. Would see again.
B004UHL9EK|1.0|It DOES NOT export times to a .csv file as advertised.  This was the only reason I upgraded to the pro version and it DOES NOT provide this function.  Get the free version.  The pro version provides no additional functionality.  The pro version is a rip-off.
B008220D5K|5.0|I laughed the entire movie ... Being 39 I can relate to the movie and family dynamic! My husband actually watched the entire movie without falling asleep. People read into the movie .. It's just a funny movie ! If it makes me laugh I'm happy :0)
B00957T6X6|5.0|The books are amazing and it's so convenient to have them all at once.  The price is also pretty good but I think they should be cheaper since it's in bulk and digital.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love watching to older season especially the ones I do not remember.  It is amazing to see how much things have changed
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Great box set,<br />Lots of pictures in the book, very nice coasters (one from Blue Parrot, one from Casablanca, one from Rick´s Café Américain and one from La Belle Aurore) a french version poster and three discs.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Nice and fun game!  Love having the hint button to help along the way.  Very nice graphics and sound track.
B00AN9DOV0|3.0|This was just an 'okay' type movie. I guess I expected more because the first two were really good in my opinion.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Though my favorite doctor thus far is the 10th, I do enjoy Matt Smith and even though I am not the biggest fans of his companions I still enjoy the show and all the adventures :-)
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Classic, great acting, good movie. Long and somewhat boring in places, but you must like musicals to truly enjoy this one.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Feels a little flimsy but u get what u pay for. Does what i want it to do.  Wish it could mount to tripod tho. Otherwise im good.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|What an awesome movie!  I was not sure what to expect but what an awesome job by actors and director.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie is one of those amazingly simple but deeply provoking movies that just happens to be sports. It takes place primarily in a sporting arena and concentrates on one event. Nevertheless it has sufficiently developed characters. Conflict and situations on several points and layers that are enough to draw the viewer in. It succeeds at being identifiable and you are forced to connect with the characters and relate to their simple issues. I would liken it to Boon Dock Saints, Apollo 13 and Million Dollar Baby. Villains change hands quickly as the story teases out the histories of the characters, their flaws and strengths, their relational dynamics and you work out the details. I enjoyed it and I recommend it.
0761169253|5.0|I totally recommend this book to anyone that has an artistic bone in their body. When I say that I do not limit it to visual arts but to every type of artist. If you read this book and are not inspired then I doubt you are breathing.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The basic premise of this book nearly scared me off. I wasn't too excited to read about a quadriplegic. However, this book enchanted me. I can't wait to read more if this authors work.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|I get Pi.  I really get him.  I know about animals having souls.  They are sentient.  I held myself together during the ship sinking.  The scene in the lifeboat with the broken zebra, the grieving orangutan and the hyena was more than I could bear (no pun intended).  While Pi was screaming no, I went fetal, covered my ears and screamed NOOOOOOOOOO.  Then I ejected the disc.  I couldn't sleep and had nightmares. I'm 54 years old.  If I had seen this as a child, I would have spent months in my parents bed.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|Classic Disney movie and so much fun to watch again! Great songs.  Funny how these spells make me think of Harry Potter spells...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is very fun and makes you happy you get to compete with other players and there is nothing wrong with this game:)
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Evil Dead had a promising trailer, so I was pretty excited for this movie and it didn't dissapointed me at all! It has everything that a good horror movie should have: gore, scary moments and lots of blood. The thing I love the most about this film, are the special effects (they were so real) and the fact that it's a remake. They have been few remakes that are as good as their original movies, and Evil Dead becomes one of those movies.<br /><br />The cast has great actors, especially (obviously), Jane Levy, who proves that she's not just a comedian, but also a scream queen that can play an innocent girl, but a possessed one too. I have seen it twice, and I think it's one of the best current horror movies between all the paranormal films that are not even scary and exorcisms (Film makers should leave that thematic alone).<br /><br />If you're looking for a great horror movie, watch Evil Dead, and you won't be dissapointed. I recommend you the original movie too, you will like it if you loved this remake.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|A really interesting look into the lives of babies around the world. No dialogue or narration, but compelling and fascinating throughout.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|It makes a copy so you don't lose your original picture, it is very easy to use, One can add text to a picture, correct the lighting, make it a black and white or other special effects. Highly recommended. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Always heard people talking about it and so we finally sat down to watch and couldn't stop until we watched all 3 seasons. Great stories, characters and plot.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|After \\"Infinity on High \\" I was expecting something amazing and at first, I was not sold on this. It just didn't have the same emotion to it, but Folie has grown on me over the years. I now listen to it at least once a week.
B009GX6TMA|5.0|Season 2 definitely proves that New Girl has the power to last for a long long time.  The writing is genius and the acting flawless, especially when it comes to Zoey and the outstanding Jake Johnson.  Not to be missed!!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Probably the worst James Bond movie I have ever seen.  I enjoy the campy, far fetched 007 escapades of the past.  The impossible situations, the cool &#34;toys&#34; 007 gets to use to get out of tight spots.  I like the girls, the opening sequence...none of those were in Skyfall.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Matilda is a childhood classic and a prefect movie for the whole family! It's a movie that never fails to please and bring joy & laughter. I recommend 100%!
0393061434|5.0|A Fantastic reading To put between everyone's hands.<br />Its an easy reading. Very well written indeed.<br />I enjoyed every page!  =)
B000AYELVU|4.0|Hi,<br />  At the beginning of this movie, while everyone is still in the natural history museum, there is a black and white animated cartoon playing on computer screens.  It is called \\"The History of the World\\" or something like that.  Can someone tell me the real name of the movie?  I've been trying to find this on YouTube or purchase a copy of it somewhere and, so far, I haven't been able to.<br />  P.S. As far as X-Men 2 goes, the first time I saw it, I was as blown away by it as I was when I first saw the Avengers.  Truly a great comic book movie.  It's perhaps in the top five of all of the comic book movies that have been made since the Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in 2002.  My favorites so far?<br /><br />Dark Knight Returns<br />X-Men 2<br />Captain America<br />The Avengers<br />X-Men Zero<br /><br />  The above list is not in of order of preference.  I like them all quite a lot.<br />  My only complaint is the usual.  I wish it were all cleaner.  I'd really like to see the profanity and sexuality disappear.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|The story is based on real life events and is very captivating and family friendly.  The acting is very well done and it is refreshing to see both sides of the environmental issues portrayed.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Bought the cable to replace the lost original one which lasted for over a year.  Not sure how they improved it, but it only lasted for 2 months before it stopped working.  Oh and you can only make returns for 30 days.
B000HF0J36|5.0|This film had a great story line, cast, and filming style. Some of the shark senes were not believeable and fake at most. But overall one of my favs
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The lead couple is so real and so likeable I wanted them to work out. The intimacy between these two is amazing.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This was a great film not what I expected. Has a overall believeable and messed up storyline. The cast is chosen wisely. a mix of known and unknown.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I could play this game all day reminds me almost exactly of magic, Awesome! Although it is glitchy at times still an amazing game! I recommend it to everyone who like magic!
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|This is another woodsy horror suspense flick. Actors chosen wisely, and film is believeable while watching. The overall outcome surprised the heck out of me. I would highly recommend if you are into these types of films.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I loved this headset, it has great sound and it is wireless! Buy it and you will not regret, can't say more.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This author is great at alligning the research and principles in the book with how they affect our daily lives and more importantly how we can effect them.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|4 years later this show keeps me hooked, the characters have not become boring and if anything have gotten more interesting. I loved watching the first 3 seasons on Netflix when I first discovered it. NOW I have to go week to week to se them...it is a great TV series. If you like Twilight, Hunger Games...you will love this show.
B004UID2LC|1.0|dose not work on Kindle fire.<br />if you are going to use it on some thing beside a kindle it mite work.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great Actors, suspensful story line which makes you come back each week to see more. If you like Sci-Fi and romance, this is it in a bundle.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Best game ever! Absolutely love playing and its highly addictive. I got it for my son's kindle and had to buy it for mine also
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I read a lot of review before I purchased this book.  Ms. Sandberg's life does not fit many of ours going to Harvard, working at Google, Facebook.  But she has had an interesting vantage point to work for her own position and the opportunity to observe many women in all levels of work.  The basic premise of the book that women need to &#34;lean in&#34; instead of out, or sit at the table not at the end of the room is valid.  She provides interesting insight and commentary about things she has learned along the way.  While reading it she has annoyed me, because her thought lines seem to be complete deluded about how most of us live and work, we are mostly trying to survive and get through the day.  Many of us have crappy jobs in generally annoying industries.  But I do think she has many useful things to say and the book is well worth reading for men and women alike.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the book.  I liked that it gave you a taste of the present and then backtracked.  It held my interest and was cute.  There were a couple of typos that got in the way of the story, but there weren't too many to really annoy me.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This is one of the best WW2, and the best WW2 sub movie of all time. It is a long drama, but you really start to feel connected to the crew and their saga. As a viewer you are conflicted, in that the story follows Nazi sailors, but you find yourself rooting for them. A timeless epic with no CGI, just great acting and great story telling.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|lots of fun.Frustrates and entertains at the same time. I'm hooked! Wish it had a better tutorial though. There are a few moves that I could use some help on.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is my Bible now.  In my Kindle, I have my Bible with me all the time.  I have access to multiple translations.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game gets my adrenaline going.  It's fun and makes me work fast.  You have to be really very precise.
B0086700CM|5.0|Just purchased this game, it is intense! More I play the less intense I am<br />So that I an gain more Ardmore points, highly recommend
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I rarely find a HO game I want to pay to continue playing this was fun &amp; the graphics were great. plus it was accurate when using a touch screen
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really loved this book, authentic, poignant, and amusing too.  I cried & laughed throughout.  Get the Misremembered Man, great read!
B000EXZI0A|5.0|If you want to introduce someone to great catchy punk...look no further than this collection. Every song is great! I recommend this to any one who wants to test the waters of true punk artistry!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is a good app if you want to keep yourself busy...plus, you don't need wifi to play.  HOW AWESOME!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful continuation of The Hunger Games.  Perfectly written, just like the first.  Love this awesome series.  Suzanne Collins is a fabulous writer.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a drama romance and action adventure all tyed into one! It's an amazing series and in no way do I regret spending restless numbers of hours reading each of these books.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book, I couldnt put it down! Max Brooks is a genius, and it shows in this book. There wasn't a dull moment.
B000002KO3|5.0|Everything that needs to be said has been said,but I always found it fascinating that an album like this could drop like a bomb from outer space and not get endlessly ripped off. Maybe people were incapable of it? And every funky post punk and gritty new wave band has failed demos for their RIL knockoff floating around in their closet of shame?<br /><br />The only bands that seem to have come close are TV On The Radio, Radiohead and.. Don't laugh, Phish.<br /><br />The first two are paranoid guitar bands that are deceptively funky with insane rhythms.. The latter might not always sound anything like this, but when Phish jams funky they skew towards a Crosseyed or Born Under Punches vibe a lot. This is the album that they covered Halloween 96, and it revolutionized the way they looked at both composition and improvisation.<br /><br />But who was ripping RIL off in the 80s? The closest facsimiles I have heard (besides Byrne's Catherine Wheel and Byrne/Eno's Bush With Ghosts) are Lizzy Messier Descioux's &#34;Mambo Nassau&#34; and A Certain Ratio's &#34;Sextet&#34; and &#34;To Each...&#34; Grace Jones &#34;Nightclubbing&#34; visits the same unverse as well.<br /><br />If anyone knows any obscure records from the 80s that hit this mix of afrobeat, funk, punk and experimentalism, or even anything close, let me know. I'd be extremely interested to hear some of them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|another great book by connelly; i really enjoy his lincoln lawyer series & this was first harry bosch novel i have done but it was great; not a guy like jack reacher & mitch rapp with super human abilities but a good detective; story was suspenseful til the end; i recomend & will download more bosch novels
B00466HNHM|5.0|The bodyguard is a movie turns out to be one off my favorite movie.<br />And Whitney Houston playes a good part in this movie and Kevin Costner play a good bodyguards in this
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some people say cool mean constspated over rated out of style loser. but this game is amazing it throw the meaning of cool away....  it rocks!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ever since i got minecraft on my kindle i played it every time i had a chance this game is fun an i consider getting it an if you get the game get pocket Inventory editor pro but u can only get it on kindle<br />an have fun
0345803507|1.0|Stupid.  Nothing more need be said......  well.... I guess I have to add more words per the Amazon criteria... so I will  boring, stupid, basic writing, nothing exciting or new, not a turn on like most think, degrading to women's intelligence... hmm... I think Ive met the word # so I wont go on.......  are these books are a joke????.....because the writing made me laugh.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This series does a great job of combining these three elements into an entertaining series. For those who love action, there are Braveheart-like battles and two-man combat reminiscent of Gladiator. There is conflict and drama between the main character, Ragnar, and Gabrielle Byrne's Eorl Haraldson. And finally, there is history. You will see Viking customs such as how they prepare to leave for a raid by washing their faces in a bowl of communal water (into which they have also cleared their sinuses). You'll see how their ships were built, and how they navigated the dangerous seas in those ships. You'll also experience what life must have been like in the English towns they raided. Finally, you'll see plenty of brawny men killing each other with axes. It's a great series, well worth watching, and since it has been renewed for a second season, there will be plenty more to watch next year.
B00BWU0S3Q|4.0|Good movie. A bit slow at times but overall worth watching. The costumes and makeup were outstanding depicting the era well.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|They took me through all the Hobbit scenario.  It was just like the book.  There wring raiths.  Very scary.  It was a great show.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was a lot better than I had expected it to be. It was very real and eye opening to some people's lives. I would definitely recommend it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game makes little girls giggle with glee! Lots of strategic thinking required, especially if you want to get all 3 stars on some of the harder levels, but the basic mechanics are easy to grasp for younger players.
B003YUBXVI|5.0|I loved the book.It's intriguing and amazingly interesting.I suggest it to anyone who likes mysteries and sci-fi,that is science fiction.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Looks more fun than it really is.  I only downloaded it cuz it was free, I would not pay for it even it it was a penny.
B0086700CM|4.0|Tempe run is a awesome game I know a lot of people who like it as well. imangi studios make awesome games to like jetpack joyride
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is beautifully written and kept me entranced from beginning to end.  This is a tough book to put down.
0380820498|5.0|The local library didn't have it in their collection so I bought a copy.  It was an excellent police procedural.  I discovered Inspector Banks on PBS and really enjoy the books.  The library now has this copy.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Very different plot development for a murder mystery . Kept you guessing who done it without being too far fetched  or too predictable. I enjoyed the main character  who wasnt too good or too bad  I would read more .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sadly, I can spend hours playing this game.  Sad because I probably ought to be doing something else, but it still intrigues me.  The town changes every month so there are new things to explore.  They've added a twist to this version - you can find keys to help save your life as you surf the subway, on top of trains or on your trusty hoverboard.
B000002LJA|5.0|Great mixture of jazz, soulful melodies, and hip hop.  Tevin Campbell, James Ingram, Siedah Garrett, stand out the most. It even has Ray Charles and Chaka Khan.
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't know what there is about a good video game, but it grabs my attention and keeps it way longer than I rightly should be spending playing mindless games.  If you like running, jumping, sliding and ducking while being chased from a temple while seeking treasure, this game should be right up your alley.
B00784637K|5.0|I've been a fan of this cd since the day it came out. Like many people, to my ears the mix sounded harsh and maybe just a bit overcompressed. Upon hearing the vinyl I'm happy to report that all those sonic gremlins are GONE! Every note is clear and crisp, fantastic stereo seperation. The drums and especially the bass guitar are WAY more punchy and the definition is really amazing. Oh man you gotta hear this!!<br />Buy the vinyl! It's worth the money.<br />Yes, today was Record Store Day. It's not a coincidence.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|I really enjoy his music and ordered while watching the 2013 award show co-hosted by Blake.  If you enjoy country music, you should already know and enjoy his music.
B00BR476TG|5.0|I loved every scene,every second of the movie. A definite one time see and I am all the more sure that kids will just love it
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Again, another video game that uses up more time than I should spend on it.  I enjoy a good puzzle and this kind of game does the trick.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|If you haven't seen it,you should! I can't believe i waited so long to get it,and was not disappointed with it at all!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|After a slow start, the story became so much more interesting.  Good book club discussion re nature vs nurture.  I thought it a bit  unrealistic.
B000002KOO|3.0|This was a surprisingly different from subsequent FM stuff. It seemed more like a &#34;dirge&#34; and was very soulful. Not our favorite from them.
0515142247|5.0|great read for anyone that likes action books and ones that involve the military, fast paced and action packed adventure.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderfully written conclusion to the epic Hunger Games trilogy- a must read for all ages. Highly recommended. Great movie series too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great read for anyone that likes action books and ones that involve the military, fast paced and action packed adventure.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|funny, motivating, fast read to get ya going and stop procrastinating to write, draw, compose whatever you need to get done.
B0012HRJEA|4.0|If you have never seen a Baz Larhman movie, get ready for a ride you will never forget!<br />Fun, colorful, and exciting!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|2 Simply a horribly pathetic ending.<br /><br />I am stunned.  The utter lack of effort toward crafting an ending is startlingly disappointing.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A must read for anyone who wants to learn more about the difficult fighting conditions our soldiers face in modern warfare.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|\\"Get Lucky\\" is such a great song! I can't wait for their new album to come out, it's been a while since their last one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was so very surprised to find a book that was unique.  So many topics are unoriginal and have been recycled over and over.  This book brings in a twist that I have never seen before!  It's a definite read.
B009NLC1D6|4.0|Another classic.  It was good to watch a movie with morals, Ben Kingsley can play any Character and make you believe.
1603427244|5.0|I am an experienced knitter but I can always learn something new.  This book is excellent with great pictures to follow.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Wonderful Movie.  One of my favorites.  Even the music was great.  It was good to watch it again and I will probably watdh it again.  Daniel Day Lewis was actually pretty.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|We should all watch this and work on reducing our carbon footprint. the more of us that do that the more impact it will have on our future
B008Q0D4MW|3.0|Pretty movie but rather boring. I am glad I did not pay to go see it. Glad I got to watch a young Ryan O Neal.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought a new van and it did not have a bluetooth radio. No problem. Bought this unit and it works like a charm. Easy to hook up, link and charge.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved it. Kept me interested the whole way through. Excellent character development and story line.  Couldn't wait to read the next chapter.
0670022411|5.0|Let me begin by saying this was far over my head with the historical and science side to this book. It was very interesting but was a little slow for me in the beginning where the story was being set up. After they left and went to Matthews mothers house, that's when it started getting fun for me. This is a very smart and clever book, not one to skim through if you want to understand everything. I'm already reading the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awesome game. I recommend that you get this game and try it out before deciding if you are gonna get the computer edition. This tablet edition of minecraft is obviously not as good as the real computer edition but it still is really awesome. If you do have the real game on the computer and really like this game I recommend that you get this game for traveling or if your computer is down for the weekend. If you are planning on keeping this game and not getting the relay edition of minecraft I want you to know that this game does have updates about once every 2 months so the game is another always the same. Finally about the updates they include new blocks and new seeds so that you can build with new stuff. HAVE FUN!!!
0061537969|3.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" reads like an earnest student's best effort in a creative writing program:  The writing is polished and grammatically correct, but it lacks rhythm and soul.  Writing from the perspective of a dog also rings false, disingenuous, and silly -- somehow the dog narrator has emotional maturity and the intelligence to string together a novel yet he's constrained into acting like a dog all the time?<br /><br />The ending is emotionally charged, and that's the highlight of this novel.  But the way over there was stilted and boring, as were the characters themselves.  We cared little for the characters, although we grieved for their tragic lives.  But perhaps the plot was much too contrived and manipulative?
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use this when I'm napping in between classes and work on campus. Great for on the go naps and even at home when you want to sleep on the sofa and not in bed next to your trust alarm. Great app!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Great movie that works even better in 3D. Well worth the money and deserving of all the oscars it won
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have never experienced true sound sleep until I used this app and the deep sleep option. Wow, what a difference! I use this for my yoga routine too. What a relaxing addition to my routine!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Couldnt put it down!  Kind of sad but soo good! highly recommend, Just be prepared to be reading for a couple of days straight.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I have a hard time using this quickly. I can't seem to get a new search started easily which is troublesome when I'm sitting in class and the professor is going on with the lector and I'm sentences behind waiting on this app.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|very good!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a great app for college students. I use it all the time for my rubrics and assignments. A must have!
B00AXVH8KQ|5.0|The record invokes several styles and bands of yesteryear, with their own spin on classic sounds.  Excellent record, highly recommended.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I'm addicted to Pinterest and now I can access it easily anywhere I go. Very user friendly.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It is a shame that the show only lasted 13 episodes. Firefly contains some of the best writing, acting, and directing ever seen on television. With a phenomanal cast and helmed by Avengers writer and director Joss Whedon, this is a series that everyone should see. The bonus features offer extended hours of entertainment.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This has always been my favorite book and I'm so glad to have found it for free on my Kindle! Now I can literally take it with me anywhere and find comfort in it's text.
0062238868|5.0|A fast and easy read, very infomative on the battle of Fallujai, Ramadi, and Sadr City. I even find Taya's part interesting, it was short and to the point from the wife's perspective. I don't know what some other readers are looking for but this book tells me what I wanted to know. It is not a lecture, not political, Chris is also very humble, none of the \\"we are the best\\", \\" we SEALs kicked a** and take names\\" etc... Too bad his life is ended too early, by a person he is trying to help. RIP Chris.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I don't use facebook that often but when I do I prefer the ease of this app verses logging into my account with a regular web browser. Now I actually use facebook more thanks to this app.
1475143389|5.0|This is a practical, highly readable, and non-intimidating guide to obtaining better results in the gym. I've been using this book as my workout and diet plan for the past 6 months or so and am happy to report that it really works. I will say that if you like unhealthy food as much as I do, some of the diet stuff can be hard to stick to...but making the effort is well worth it none-the-less.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|It's a good book, however it suffers from a lack of a cohesive timeline. At least, I find it suffers. Overall, it did not live up to the hype surrounding it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think it's all been said already -Great show, We watch it all the time, can't wait for next season!
B008MF3OEY|5.0|I love to read and the Marbled Blue looks like a book.<br />Had many compliments on it.<br />I will recommend it to anyone who asks.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Even though one knows how this story ends, the events leading up to it are captivating and scary.it is awesome to picture how a dedicated person can achieve a goal , even after bucking a system of politicians
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|addictive fun cant put it down fun for all ages the. missions are extra fun. Don't want to find the end of this app
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Beware this game is so awesome it is very addictive!!!  I love to play every day. It also has allowed me to make friends from all over the world!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game. Loved the 3D and loved the challenge. Felt like a Chinese puzzle box. If I`d had more patience, I wouldn't have used any hints. Loved it!
B0099Y2YL6|3.0|The Downton Abbey series have been such a delight to watch.  Why did PBS show additional scenes that were not on the UK edition.  I am disappointed in this.  Will next season's continue?  Not sure where to find the additional scenes because I purposely did not watch it on TV so I could view the entire season in one sitting.  That is why I purchased this DVD.
0345472322|5.0|What's the difference between failing and learning? Your mindset! According to Carol Dweck, famed Stanford psychologist, it all boils down to whether you think of talent or intelligence as either a fixed ability or one capable of growth through effort and practice. Often it comes down to whether you seek validation or a challenge. Whether you look at people on teams, at work, at school, in marriages or any relationships, fixed vs. growth mindset is a VERY important concept to understand--only if you want a better life. Every leader, parent, and teacher should read this book.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a bit slow in the beginning, but the plot never meandered. The ending was gripping and tear jerking. It has everything you would hope for in a good book.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|It was good. That's it just good. Kids will like it. So it's worth watching. Story line is ok . The other ice ages where better.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|This were bought as a gift for my daughter to replace the pair she currently has which are worn out.  They fit well and are quite comfortable. She is on her feet all day as a bartender/server.  The first pair worked well so she asked for a replacement pair for her birthday.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have loved the music from this play for years (seen it on stage twice). While there are small deviations from the soundtrack as recorded from the stage production, this really gives you the look and feel of the period in ways that a sound recording or stage viewing just can't quite manage.
076421120X|5.0|I'll start off with a 100% superficial point (great to do for a faith devotional, I know ;) ). I love how this book looks and feels. I know, I'm weird. But the colors on the cover, the pages, photography, the design. I don't care if this book was about the different wingspans of pigeons, I would still grab it off the shelf.<br /><br />Now on to what matters a bit more. Through Revealing Jesus: A 365-Day Devotional, Darlene Zschech shows again that she can help people draw closer to God not only through music, but through words on a page as well.<br /><br />Sprinkled throughout are classic devotions as well, allowing the reader to learn from the likes of Spurgeon, E.M. Bounds, Andrew Murray, Luther, Oswald Chambers & A.W. Tozer.<br /><br />Each month focused on one of Christ's attributes/characteristics like Faithful, Solid Rock, Risen One, Savior, Redeemer, Friend of Sinners and Messiah. I'll say I'm a fan of all of the above.<br /><br />There's devotions dedicated to the different names of God and what that means to our faith. Based upon incredible spiritual foundations, this daily devotion will help you to grow in your faith and understanding of who God is.<br /><br />The entries are thought-provoking, inspiring, convicting and worth adding to your collection!<br /><br />(I received a copy from Bethany House Publishers to review)
B00A80SHFM|1.0|I thought it was the full soundtrack even though it does say highlights I never paid any attention to it as I already had it I had to sell it, I wasn't that fond of it anyway as I wanted all the songs in full.<br />Should of paid more attention.
B00992CF6W|5.0|loving it! it the bedt game ever! not too good and not too bad! have it on computer and ipad 2!
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Master and Commander follows British Captain Jack Aubrey as he chases a nemesis across the Atlantic, around Cape Horn, and into the Pacific. Along the way he has to deal with an old ship that needs repair, a diverse crew, an unlucky junior officer, and his surly friend Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor. Captain Aubry must catch his enemy before he can capture the valuable British whaling fleet.<br /><br />This movie is very enjoyable. It gives a pretty good look into the life of the British navy during the Napoleonic Wars. For the plot Director Peter Weir borrowed freely from a number of the Aubrey/Maturin stories by Patrick O'Brian. The characters make the show. Russell Crowe captures the serious side of Jack Aubrey, though more time should have been given to Aubrey's more amusing side. The Jack Aubrey of the novels is a lot more fun loving than the Aubrey we see in the film. Even so Crowe gives us a character that, like his crew, we can both love and respect. Paul Bettany is wonderful as Stephen Maturin. Maturin is a learned man and a physician who has taken to adventuring as the ship's doctor. He is Jack's friend and confidant.<br /><br />This a great film and can be enjoyed by those who have read and enjoyed the novels and by those who have never read them. If you have never read the novels then do yourself a favor, watch this movie, then go and start reading the novels.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I heard the movie was good, but would not see it without reading the book first.  The book is great and really makes me appreciate life as I know it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|A great first album from this new trio. The term folk music doesn't really have much meaning, I guess that is the category this would be in. There are a range of sounds on this album from the fun acoustic opening &#34;Flowers In Your Hair&#34; through acoustic romps like &#34;Ho Hey&#34; and &#34;Big Parade&#34; all the way to the heartbreaking closing track &#34;Morning Song&#34; If you listen you can hear influences that range from Bob Dylan and Bruce  Springsteen to John Prine.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I have all of the previous years of this series and have truly enjoyed watching each of them.  This one is no exception.  I look forward to buying and viewing season 5 also.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|If you want the REAL BASIC about GUNS career, this is a good compilation....But, i really like GUNS N ROSES, and there´s LOTS and lots of great songs missing....ok, the classics WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE and SWEET CHILD O MINE are here, but where´s MR. BROWSTONE, NIGHTRAIN, IT´S SO EASY, ROCKET QUEEN.....and than there´s the HUGE HIT PATIENCE and A LOT OF BALLADS!!!! Yes, GUNS ballads are great, but besides the heavy YOU COULD BE MINE, there´s only the soft side of the AMAZING USE YOUR ILLUSION albums!!!! as i said, if you want the BASIC HITS, they are here, but in my opinion, try the full albums APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION and both USE YOUR ILLUSION, ah, and SPAGHETTI INCIDENT too....GUNS N ROSES was a gifted band and most ALL their songs are HEAVY ROCK pearls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0316227706|5.0|My MPs assistant recommended it to me and I bought it straight away. As soon as I got it, I gave it to my boyfriend and he passed it on to his best friend. If you buy it, you run a high risk that it will be passed on to many other people and you might never get it back!
B0086900TI|2.0|I bought this because it was filmed at my middle and high school. It was painful to watch and was very depressing. Don't waste your time.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Is not for young ones. I wonder if it is historically accurate. I enjoyed it. Special effects were very real.
B0029SCFE0|5.0|Despite the more graphic intimate moments (trying not to ruin the details for those who haven't seen this), the remainder of the story is entirely original.  One my favorite 10 films of all time.
B0013UIUBC|4.0|I love this movie, so when I saw the movie I knew I had to buy it.<br />I would definitely recommend it.
0988178532|5.0|Right from the beginning you are whipped into the story that never lags!  Brandt's writing keeps you captivated and with descriptions you can create pictures in your mind.  I usually take a couple of months to finish a book, maybe more, but not with this one.  There I was reading it from room to room whenever I could grab a few minutes and actually making time so I could get back to it.  This mystical story provokes your imagination with wonder if this is really fiction!  Bring on the next book!  I loved it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I chose a five star because of how creative the show is. It's like watching an excellent, continuous movie. Can't wait for Season 4 to begin!
0030839939|4.0|This is a great book and I like it. I used it as my primary text book in my condensed matter class this year. If you have never taken condensed matter or at least thermal dynamics/ statistical physics you might want to supplement this book with another more qualitative book.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Basically, it's the stunt bike game but with a rollercoaster and hilarious riders. Each type of rider (the fluffies) gives you an extra bonus. The bonuses you get increase your score. This is my new game to play when I only have one quick minute to spend!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is a great game with many fun minigames. the only issue with it is the game is a bit short, i hope it could be longer！
0071762345|4.0|With new technology appearing in our world more rapidly than ever before, it is quite hard sometimes to keep up-to-date on how to best use these technologies.  Social media is one of those new technologies that can be difficult to navigate without assistance.  In Dave Kerpen's Likeable Social Media:  How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand, and Be Generally Amazing on Facebook (and other social networks), he gives useful tips and advice for how to represent a product, company, or organization on social media, specifically Facebook.<br /><br />Right in his introduction he tells the reader point blank what social media can and can't do.  First, social media cannot make up for a bad product, company, or organization.  Many people think that social media will help their sales of a certain product.  This example may be true if the product is a good and valuable product.  On the other hand if this product is bad social media will actually hurt your sales and in turn your business.  Second, social media won't lead to overnight sales success.  Social media sites are social, meaning there still has to be a relationship built between people; that relationship requires time.  Last, social media is not free.  It may be free to join Facebook, but it costs money to advertise on the site and compensate the brains behind the site.<br /><br />In eighteen chapters Kerpen goes in to depth about how to be authentic all the way to defining your target audience better than ever.  The introduction of every chapter slides you smoothly into the content and advice he provides.  He also starts out with simple knowledge that people may know about and then goes into the nitty gritty aspects of a concept.  While he talks about various social media sites, Facebook is his bread and butter.  It is all about that little thumbs up button, which makes all the difference.  I like the saying he uses, \\"The Like is more important than the Link.\\"  It is not just about getting viewers toyour site anymore; it's about getting them to like you on Facebook because then they will spread the word among their Facebook friends and the more likes a page receives the more often it will be viewed on the site.<br /><br />The organization of the chapters Dave Kerpen uses makes this book an exciting, enjoyable, and easy read.  He provides case examples all along the way to show you how beneficial social media can be.  At the end of every chapter there are action items that he includes so the reader can then put what they have learned into action.  For example, one of these action items is to, \\"Create a 15-second elevator pitch to tell your customers and anyone you come into contact with why they should like you on Facebook and follow you on Twitter.\\"  This is a great exercise because it helps the reader target in on what they want their product to be known for.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a great tool for businesses wanting to learn how to navigate social media, and I would recommend purchasing it.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|great show and stories and who wouldn't like to see stana katic in any show period. she is the hottest

B000MPSX34|5.0|Probably the best movie that my granddaughter and I have ever watched together! Great story line, and the cinematography was spectacular...MUST SEE!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Kind of addicting!! But fun and found some good recipes, kids crafts, and fashion ideas.<br />Even my daughter who's 12 is loving it. All ages can find something.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Game is really fun and addictive. Worth the 1$. Even bought the extra worlds for it. And wish that I haven't miss the sale when they had it for the PC.
0545123267|5.0|Seriously. I can't say enough good things about this whole series. Did you know that the text in each book is actually the same color as the cover? So this one has dusty blue ink--I didn't realize that until about 70% of the way through the book. (The subsequent two books have emerald green and brick red text, respectively--the blue is a bit more demure, but they're all highly readable.) I think this collection is a great example of the reading *experience*. I was delighted by not only the story, but the actual book. Kudos to the publisher.
B008C20TDG|5.0|After going paleo, I eat better and I feel better.  This book is straight forward, informative and great recipes included!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|If your a Star Trek fan, you won't be disappointed! The picture quality is amzing! Plus all the special features are really interesting! Pick it up. You won't be sorry!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Details for the next 24 hours and next 10 days. Multiple locations, easy to move across them and to navigate the data provided. A must have for travelers, especially when touching multiple places in one trip. Jurisdictions work well on kindle fire. Graphics are nice, but not heavy, like some other apps. Ads are discrete and not intrusive. I wonder why is not the default app on the Fire.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book...I was skeptical about reading because Augustus Waters died of the same cancer that my grandmother died of! I was so glad that I read it because it inspires Me to look past illness to find love an  compassion in someone, and that we all wish, but alas the world is not a wish granting factory! I cruelly recommend the book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read!!!! Twist and turns, laughter and tears. A wonderful all around book!!!!!!!!!<br />This is a book to pass on to each one of your friends :)
B0076DELIG|3.0|In my opinion the book was too slow in moving along with the story.  I needed to push myself to keep reading to the end.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|love love love!!!! Sometime a little cheesy but draws you right in! If you are into zombie and/or vampire shows of this nature I would recommend that you watch it.
0345803507|5.0|I loved all three books. I understand what other reviewers are saying when they say that the book was repetitive but I loved it anyway. I just finished a couple days ago and cannot get Christian and Ana out of my head. Seriously think this is going to be a book that I can read another time. I love how strong Ana becomes since the first book. Especially when she stands up to him after informing him that she is pregnant and to the way he handles the news. Definitely was worth my time to read.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|love love love!!!! Sometime a little cheesy but draws you right in! If you are into zombie and/or vampire shows of this nature I would recommend that you watch it.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I loved it, good to have a movie of it again. I had a movie of it on a [VHS] when it first came out in 1986. I watched it nineteen times no lieing. and my dad in his late seventys loved it too. it's a great blues movie.
0470449764|5.0|he GMAT OG Quantitative book should be an essential book for anyone preparing for the GMAT.<br /><br />The Good:<br />You'll get hands on experience with real GMAT quant questions that have been previously administered on actual tests, but have now been retired. Since the questions in this book were once part of the actual test, you'll know exactly what type of questions to expect when you take your test.<br /><br />How to Turn the Good to Work:<br />To make the best use of this book, use it after you undergo a thorough review of all the math concepts. The best source for doing so would be the Kaplan book if you need a quick refresher, or the EZ Solutions GMAT series if you need a thorough review of each and every math concept imaginable.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I hadn't read the book/s or had much interest, but friends convinced me to watch it, and I have to say it is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  All of the cast members were superb!
0470449756|5.0|Note that questions in this book are on average somewhat easier than ones found in The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 12th Edition. If you are looking for 700+ Verbal practice - look elsewhere.<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK IF:<br />1. You are studying using Manhattan GMAT books (there are only a few practice questions in the books and for additional practice,they refer to questions in the OG 12 and this book)<br />2. You need more practice with average and low difficulty verbal questions<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF:<br />- You have OG 10 (there is quite a bit of overlap)<br />- You have used or were planning to use power prep (previous version of the GMAT prep software has quite a bit of overlap too)<br />- You have purchased paper GMAT tests from GMAC (overlap again)<br />- You have not gone through OG 12 yet
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My kindle would not take a charge. I determined that the cause was a broken wire in the USB cable. I ordered a new cable from Amazon received it in two days and the new cable fixed the charging problem. Very fast delivery from Amazon.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This disc rocks!! I haven't been disappointed with anything they have done... Always great rock records! The energy in this disc is great to workout or run to. All of the songs from this album are in my workout playlist. Add &#34;White Limo&#34; to a part of your workout where you need a little &#34;push&#34; to go further!<br /><br />The songwriting is excellent- from beginning to end.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|It is worth noting that the French regard Victor Hugo as a poet and consider his novels, including the 1862 LES MISERABLES, minor works.  The novel became popular in America during the Civil War, when it was widely read by the Confederacy, who often refered to the book as \\"Lee's Miserables.\\"  Thereafter, like many Victorian-era novels, it enjoyed cyclical popularity until 1980, when it was adapted into an operetta with lyrics by Alain Boublil and music by Claude-Michel Schonberg.  The original production played for three months in Paris.  It was subsequently further adapted by Herbert Kretzmer and James Fenton into the English language, and opened in London in 1985 and then in New York in 1987.  The London and New York versions were extremely popular at the box office and ran for years.  The original New York production alone ran for over six thousand performances.<br /><br />None of this has actually made critics like the show any better than they originally did, and it has been consistently described as manipulative, sentimental, and unoriginal.  The film version was an on-again, off-again affair, finally debuting in 2012.  Musicals generally have their musical numbers pre-recorded, and the cast lip-sychs during filming.  For LES MISERABLES, however, the singers performed live on set, and some publicity claims indicated this was the first time such had been done (not true; live on-set musical numbers go back at least as far to Doris Day in the 1957 THE PAJAMA GAME.)  Since most of the film cast were not trained singers, the result was somewhat hit or and miss, with Russell Crowe receiving significantly negative comments--but when it did work, it worked spectacularly, with Anne Hathaway giving a devastating performance and picking up an Oscar for her efforts.  But again, critics were not really any more enthusiastic about the film than they had been about the play.  Many noted that if you liked the play, you would probably like the film, but if you didn't like the play, nothing about the film would make you change your mind.  I didn't and it didn't.<br /><br />Although the movie is not noticeably like the book, it has much the same story, and a good many people have described it as \\"the show where everybody sings about how poor they are and then most of them die.\\"  Although acid, this is actually a fairly straight forward comment, for the plot traces the troubles of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), imprisoned for almost twenty years on a trivial charge and, when he breaks parole, relentlessly persued by the French law in the form of Javert (Russell Crowe.)  Ill-starred lovers and angry revolutionaries round out the tale.  Curiously, the film relies a great deal on CGI, which tended to undercut my belief in the story, but my primary dismissal of LES MISERABLES rests on the fact that it is two and a half hours of overwrought emotion, with every single character playing at the same hysterical pitch.  It does not help that the music is incredibly, incredibly repetitive; virtually every song echoes every other song (I began to feel I was a trapped in an endless loop of \\"At The End of the Day\\" and \\"Bring Him Home.\\")  Within thirty minutes I was exhausted and by the end of the film I was thoroughly over it.  Still, the occasional good performance (especially Hathaway) makes it worth the effort.  Depending on which version you get, the DVD comes with various bonuses, none of them particularly interesting.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerplay, nothing about the film would make you change your mind.

B00280LYIC|5.0|This Book is one of the best books I have read in my lifetime. Hopefully you will want to read it too. If you like Greek mythology, you will definitely like this book. Please read it!!!!!
B0024RIMBG|2.0|This version does not have the song Orinoco Flow, but it has the same art work around the DVD as the version with Orinoco Flow.<br />So after finding out that I bought the wrong copy I had to buy the better version with Orinoco Flow.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|If you don't like Daft Punk then you are beyond saving. It is as simple as that. Seriously. Listen to Daft Punk, I'm so pumped for this album!!!!
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Many scenes of battles and use of special effects. Not so long on plot. Fun to see if you are not really wedded to the book, which was quite charming and memorable.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A great mystery with ancient undertones taking place  in modern San Francisco and New York.  Subterranean libraries, three story book stores, unusual characters and more, make<br /> this book a page turner!  Enjoy!  I sure did!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Its a classic, what can you say. Well, i guess i would like more special features. Even with the two disc, there arent that many additions
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|Really enjoyed this game.  It was fun to discover all the paintings.  Just wish you could own more museums ( for more money and locations ;).  Waiting for the sequel!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|The movie was good fun. I chose this movie because I like anything with Johnny Depp and I would recomend this movie to everyone.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|not country - not rock but really good the more you hear the more you want just give them  a try
B00270WH3Y|5.0|These guys were coming on the scene when I was a teenager and had just released a lot of stuff after Mrs. Robinson.  The album has brought back some good memories and made me want to look for more of their older work.  Very good album.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I enjoy almost all portrayals of Sherlock Holmes. This is one is my favorites. Jonny Lee Miller's performance of the eccentric Holmes is awesome - never would have imagined Sherlock Holmes with tattoos.
B005LJITS0|5.0|The Green Lantern is the most powerful hero of the Justice League. Of course, the Justice League way over powers the Avengers.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Got this for my daughter (10 years old) and she loves it. Cast is great, and the story was cute.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Great movie. Its pretty far from the comic book but if you're not one of those people who complain about stuff like that, its amazing.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It was a great I look forward to the next adventure<br />I would definitely recommend it to friends. Great read
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It's a crazy show. There are credibility issues. There are a lot of convenient things that just happen. But it grabs my attention anyway. I love all the crazy characters in all their special kingdoms. I can see the stories try to show the conflicts that can arise  between a person's character and a moral choice that contradicts it. Ned Stark showed this in stark reality. I love how the dragons came to life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A record setting number of plot twist that will forever be a part of my Costa Rican Spring Break.  I enjoyed the depth of  character development, particularly the sociopathic  &#34;love to hate,  love to love her&#34; Amy.  I think Flynn's novel is the best book of the year because it does take the reader on a big emotional trip to a crazy place that is the heartland.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie kept me engaged throughout the whole thing and I cannot think of another movie I have seen recently that did that.  One of the best flicks I've seen in a long time.  I paid $5 for the rental and will still be buying it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! So did my 3 year old who doesn't like anything except cartoons lol some of the content went over her head and was a little too mature for her but she loved it. 5 STARS!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Teenage chick flick with a little action thrown in to sucker in a guy to watch.  Not the worst, but definitely not up to the hype.

0738711500|5.0|Beautiful cards and the book is very informative.  I am making my card journal currently but it is slow work trying to memorize each card.

B0013FSXTG|5.0|It does not play in my hd player. can I exchange it? Let me know what to do to get one that plays.
B0063GORYU|4.0|it is a lovely game.  lots of Color and tons of fun. just don't forget to become untangled in the end. simple but effective and easy to use. And best of all (for now) its free
B001NLKWLW|2.0|I found this book very confusing . The name changed the years went back and forth. I didn't feel it was<br />worth the effort.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|For the longest time this set was all but impossible to find anywhere. Only ones I could find were marked up to 2 - 3 times the retail price, some even more than that! So when it showed up on Amazon at normal retail price I purchased immediately. The value of this set is a little low due to the small number of pieces included, but I knew this before purchase (my son loves it regardless). This set was a birthday present for him and he couldn't be happier.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|My husband & I both got them, Love Them.  We take our Kindle Fire's with us everywhere, especially doctors offices without worry of scratching them.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This is...childish.  This is...trite.  This is...cliche. This is...lame.  This is...what Hollywood wants you to think middle age is.  This was...a waste of money.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I bought them because they're much brighter than the Mr. Beams MB723 model I bought for my hallway.  This is too bright for hallway but perfect for my washer/dryer and closet.<br /><br />The velco tape does not stick to wall, it fell off overnight.  I just hang it with a nail instead.  I still gave it a 5 star because it is exactly the amount of light I need for my closets.  Unless you want a bright hallway, you might consider another brand.
B00920HMNM|5.0|I have to say that this is the best new music by D. Fagan in quite some time. The earlier stuff just didn't do it for me, maybe I was expecting more Steeley Dan. This albumn delivers nicely. Three sides is a little bit wierd for vinyl, but I would sure by it again with no regrets.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|She just got her CBE & she's still making excellent music. If you're a fan, then you already know how wonderful she is. This is the best of her more recent albums. there's a few to hum along to and a few that are pure musical poems. i don't think any of the guests really added or subtracted from the album ...
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This  app is awesome and I really love all of the obstructions. It is kind of like Wii Mario Bro's if you ask me. I love this game and I think you should make a 3rd one.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I struggled so much while in high school that I feel this book could have been a story of my life. Anyone who is in high school should read this.
B000J103OI|5.0|Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep were phenomenal. This movie was a very well written comedy-drama. Definitely a chick flick, good luck getting your guy to watch this!
B009LRE040|5.0|As always batman movies rock... this one seems to leave the door wide open for so much more. Definitely worht the money and time !
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This is a great romantic comedy for both guys and girls. It's almost more of a guy flick than a chick flick.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|For fans of the series, this book is more of the same. That is to say, it is gripping and unpredictable in the best possible way.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The episodic moments are graphic but understated and that allows theory behind &#34;the meaning&#34; to become clear through the examples without being lost in the misery.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Well G5 has done it again! The more I play G5 games, the more of a fan I am. This one was a LOT of fun. I love the different modes you can play. Graphics are pretty good as well. Loved the story line. Well worth the download. Though I have submitted several reviews and have never got a sequel for reviewing. =(

B003MC5N28|5.0|A great little short read for all ages. While reading, I was thinking \\"okay...okay...okay...\\" and after finishing, I thought \\"Wow\\" and couldn't stop thinking about the ending. I encourage any and all who enjoy a good story to read this book.
B0070XFNDE|3.0|I love the writing style, the characters, the setting, and the plot. It's a great setup for the next book. The problem is exactly that. It is a setup for the next book. I really want to know what happens next, and I think I should have learned that in this book.  I was very disappointed by the way the book ended.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|This trilogy is a masterpiece. The first time I read it I was in the sixth grade, and I have read it another two times since. These books are very-well written and very-well thought out, and I personally love the adventure they provide their readers with.<br /><br />When I first read them as an adolescent, the end of the trilogy shook me as a Christian. I wasn't technically a Christian yet, according to the current definition I claim, but I was trying to find my place in Christianity. The ending makes the author's atheism very evident, and either makes or breaks the story for the reader. For me, I'm not sure whether it made or broke the story (the first time), since I don't know where I was then in relevance to my religion. But now, being solid in where I stand (as a Christian), I can look around the implications of this fictional story and see the amazing piece of work Philip Pullman has created. It's an amazing story, and despite whatever religion you claim, you should read it, especially if you enjoy reading, adventure, and thought-provoking material. However, if you are a fundamentalist Christian parent who's wondering whether they should allow their child to read this work (from an atheist author) or not, I suggest you read it for yourself before you decide (though I believe you will probably decide to advise against your child's reading of it). Though I encourage you to keep an open mind, I know that \\"narrow is the gate,\\" and you must do what you must for your child's security of mind. But realize that your child will come into contact with the world and the people in it sooner or later, and you can't stop that no matter how much you may try.<br /><br />This story is brilliant. It's fiction at its best.<br /><br />These are meant to be children's books, but I would recommend these books for no one below the age of 8, since the writing and storyline can be complex at times. There are also mythical, mystical, and war-like elements. The bear battle is a bit gory and the main character is a liar, for example; there are things of this world and those of another included in the story (witches, talking bears, spirits, magic, science, daemons, etc.). As always, if you question whether your child should read these books, read them yourself and determine with your own standards.and the main character is a liar, for example; there are things of this world and those of another included in the story (witches, talking bears, spirits, magic, science, daemons, etc.).

1592402690|2.0|Geoff Emerick had the incredible luck to be in a unique situation and could have given us a real treat.  Sadly, the book is quite annoying and a great deal of it is absolute crap. Its just another in the endless series of Beatles pathographies. Lies, but lucrative ones.<br /><br />In this book you will learn the George Harrison was a fumble-fingered guitarist (the phrase will be tirelessly repeated just in case any reader is too stupid to grasp it the first or tenth time) with an unpleasant personality and that Ringo Starr was an unsteady time keeper and a bore. As well the reader will learn that Paul was a sort of God who was the leader and Savior of the Beatles.<br /><br />The book will delight those who adore Paul McCartney (the best man at the author's wedding BTW). But it is certain to irritate those who appreciate the gifts of all four Beatles, if not equally then, at least reasonably or a bit objectively.<br /><br />First of all, isn't it amazing that 50 years later, so many of us still care passionately about the subject with all its controversies?<br /><br />I guess it would not be to strong to say that I hated this book, or at least large parts of it, due to its monotonous harping on the theme that Harrison and Starr were barely adequate musicians with lousy personalities while Paul was the musical genius, handsome, charming, lovable... Bleh!  But I read it through nevertheless for the grains of truth in it.<br /><br />I have been a guitarist pretty much since the time in 1963 that my mother bought the Beatles American VJ album. I've been playing the music of the 60's in bands for many years. I and every other guitarist I know who grew up in that era or who just loves that era, have tremendous respect for the clean, perpetually clear, and tasteful playing of George Harrison, who was as far from fumble fingered as anyone could imagine. Drummers I know appreciate that Starr was like a rock timing wise. This isn't based on studio work, this is based on live performances that demonstrate the talents of Harrison and Starr over and over. They may have been overshadowed by Lennon and McCartney (or Clapton and Ginger Baker) but they were no mediocrities. Emerick was pretty much a child when he formed his adoration of Paul at the expense of the other Beatles. Understandable I guess, since McCartney was the only Beatle to be really friendly with him, but it makes for a very boring book.<br /><br />While I don't doubt that Emerick really feels this way, I suspect that the ghost writer and the book company itself  may have exaggerated this tiresome theme to add \\"human interest\\" and controversy to an otherwise technical sort of book. As well, there is an awful lot of ego in Emerick and while I do not doubt that he was highly competent and creative at what he does, he still managed to considerably and rather tirelessly overstate his contribution. He did not work on many of the Beatles albums and those that he did not work on are no worse. Somehow the Beatles would have made music without his help and it probably would have been no less great.  Most likely this was another strategy on the part of the ghost writer to add the \\"spice\\" that is missing in the technical details. The writing itself has some good moments but much of it is pretty childish, third rate, and a lot of it is just painful to read, with a tone like a mediocre children's novel. I found the writing got better around the period of the white album.<br /><br />Emerick has a strongly stated bias against ever album he did not work on, its very egotistical and transparent. As well, he seems to have disliked a lot of the more modern pieces, he complains that the Beatles thought the EMI staff were not very hip, but its pretty obvious in his case that this was true. Rock music evolved very rapidly from 1966-1969, we remember the Beatles so well precisely because they were ahead of the curve and made the transition from \\"I want to hold your hand\\" to the louder more raucous music found for example on the White Album (one of my favorite Beatles albums). The times they were a changin and Emerick seems oblivious to influences such as the Vietnam war that influenced Lennon in particular.<br /><br />Now, just to declare my own biases, My favorite Beatles are Lennon, Harrison, McCartney, and Starr in that order on the personal level and I think that Lennon and McCartney clearly were a cut above Harrison in song writing ability  for at least the first 70% of the band's years, as well as having superior lead vocal talents. I find McCartney rather egotistical and self-infatuated, but at the same time, I am reasonable, who in his shoes would not have been?  Lennon was no less egotistical (he declared a band meeting at one point to discuss his revelation that he was Jesus, by that time his sanity was in doubt as a reaction to the world's reaction to him). Paul was probably the best bassist of his generation, his bass lines were amazing and (being in a well respected little band that does 60s music) I can say that if one plays Beatles songs the bass parts have to be done faithfully and with huge energy or the song does not work.  Paul had the greatest melodic gift in the band, and I have no doubt that he was in a certain sense the most dedicated and professional member. The other members lost their interest as time went on and I think were appalled by the over the top reactions the band generated. Many of my favorite Beatles song are Paul's compositions. I don't doubt that he was Harrison's equal as a guitarist and he was often more aggressive in his guitar solos, Harrison was more laid back and just less egotistical, for better or for worse. So, I hold McCartney's musical abilities in the highest esteem and cannot blame Emerick for his admiration of McCartney's huge talent and gifts. McCartney may well have been the force that held the band together after, say, 1967, and thus given us a few more years and some of their best work. I am very gratefulfor all that, the music was a huge part of my childhood and life.<br /><br />On the other hand while McCartney wrote sweet and often sort of silly ballads, Lennon brought often angry social commentary. This, again, is a huge factor in the fact that 50 years later we still care about the Beatles like we remember no other pop group. It was exactly Lennon's social bite and involvement in the protests of the 60s the makes the Beatles forever relevant, \\"When I'm sixty four\\" or \\"Lovely Rita\\" would not do that. It may not have been pleasant to be around the somewhat deranged later Lennon, but Lennon was in touch with the disturbing nature of the times and was, in my opinion, the driving force that kept the Beatles social conscience alive and made them a revolutionary force for change rather than just four cute mopheads.<br /><br />It was not necessary to tear the George, Ringo, and John Lennon  down as repetitiously and tediously as Emerick does. It ruins the book for me. I find his taste in the songs to be very limited and he might have been better to keep his negative (and rather un-hip) opinions to himself.<br /><br />I would say that there are probably tens of thousands of people who agree with Emerick's assessment of where the talent lay (and did not lie) in the Beatles and which songs and periods were their high points, but tens of millions who would disagree.<br /><br />What a shame he and his ghost writer wrote such a disagreeable and limited book.<br /><br />Postscript: After posting my review and getting one dumb comment on it I did a little bit of searching on the web, which brought me to this critique from Ken Scott, another EMI engineer who worked with the Beatles. It confirms everything I thought about the book. Its Pure Dung, just an invention to rip people off and make a fast buck.<br /><br />Here is Scott's opinion on Emerick's book:<br /><br />\\"Being one of the few who got to see the Beatles record, up close and personal, I have always been bothered by the many people who disseminate false stories, always for a fast buck or some kind of ego boost. I have been waiting for someone with credentials - like Geoff Emerick - to come out, finally, with the true story. When his Here, There and Everywhere was announced, I was so happy. The truth would be told, finally.<br /><br />I was in for a big disappointment. I was one of the people interviewed for Geoff's book, as were many other former Abbey Road employees. We all came to understand that these interviews were arranged because he had very little recall of those days, and his co-author would use our memories to become Geoff's stories.<br /><br />Now, after reading his book, I KNOW how little he remembers. It appears that we, the interviewees, didn't give enough, because much of the book is based on clearly fabricated stories -- things he made up to fill out the book. A good example is the detailed recollection of the overdub session he worked on for \\"Misery.\\" However, in an interview in 2003, with Ken Michaels, Geoff was quoted as saying: \\"I was informed the other day, and couldn't remember it, that 'Misery' was the first track that I was actually present on.\\" Amongst these stories are many things that could be proven untrue by astute Beatles fans, and things easily shown to be false by those who were there.<br /><br />Taken as single points, it is easy to say \\"so what\\"; but when one turns into two, two turns into one hundred, etc., the veracity of everything comes into question. Unlike any other band, the Beatles are now part of history -- and it is my feeling that their history should be told correctly. As part of that history, Geoff did AMAZING work recording them; but if one can't remember or take the time to double-check the facts, DON'T WRITE A BOOK.\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"I cannot bring this missive to an end without mentioning the book's relentless tirade against George Harrison. As a second engineer, I was on more Beatles sessions than Geoff, and saw noneof the problems talked about constantly. Sadly, George is not in a position to defend himself today. I think I know what his reaction would have been anyway. Mine is utter disgust.<br /><br />This book is NOT accurate, it is not the truth, and does not deserve to be supported. It is very damaging to the good reputations of such people as George Harrison, George Martin, John Lennon, Chris Thomas, Ringo Starr, Phil McDonald and the list goes on.\\"<br /><br />I wish that Ken Scott would write a book. Anyone interested can look up his website and find the entire scope of his comments on this repulsive book.

B0087X728K|5.0|My dad had an fairly aged Dell Inspiron 1521 laptop.  Upon boot the fans were always at full throttle and the laptop was extremely warm.  It would also shut down on its own every one in a while.  Of course this is all evidence for over heating.  I downloaded CPU ID HWMonitor.  From boot and it just sitting idle the temps were 50-55 degrees.  If i just opened an internet browsers temps would reach 70 degrees!  That should be CPU maxed out temps.  NOT GOOD!  I bought Arctic Silver and opened up the laptop.  The thermal paste was rock solid.  With further research I learned this is typical with Dell laptop.  Crappy thermal paste to save a few pennies apparently.  After removing the old stuff and applying this stuff and a little spring cleaning (dust) the idle temps are around 35 degrees.  Normal use the hover around 41 degrees and maxed out CPU temps hover between 65-70 degrees.  Couldn't really expect any better.

B005LAII4E|3.0|I really enjoyed GI Joe Rise of Cobra. It was not perfect but it was a good movie. In an age where cinema gives the audience reboots, sequels, prequels, and adaptations, here are my thoughts on GI Joe Retaliation.<br /><br />Returning to the movie: Channing Tatum as Duke, Ray Park as Snake Eyes, Byung-hun Lee as Storm Shadow(good performance), Jonathan Pryce as the President, and taking the role as primary villain this time around; Arnold Vosloo as Zartan. New additions include: Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, RZA as Blind Master, D J Cotrona as Flint, Bruce Willis as Joseph Colton, and the beautiful Adrienne Palicki as Lady Jaye(yes she IS hot). The acting was not the best all the way through, but I do not always expect \\"the greatest acting ever\\" with a movie like this.<br /><br />The story line is actually quite fun, and there will be some surprises thrown your way while watching this movie. Occasionally, there are times when the script goes all over the place and it does have a few cheesy one liners, but it does have its undeniably funny moments including (spoiler) watching Channing Tatum play video games. The story may not be the best, but Retaliation does deliver the goods in terms of action, sound, and its core plan as a movie.<br /><br />As stated in my headline, I feel Retaliation is not entirely better than its predecessor, but it is a good feeling when despite the flaws, and major/minor differences, you still find yourself enjoying a movie for what it is. GI Joe Retaliation is likable as a sequel, and while i do feel improvements can/should be made, I see no problem with a 3rd movie being made. As a matter of fact, I welcome it.<br /><br />7.4/10

B006ZCWTXS|5.0|A few months ago, my wife asked me to make a gospel CD for her so I decided I would add my favorite gospel song `Amazing Grace'. I checked YouTube for versions of the song and for some reason decided to listen to a version sung by an X Factor contestant named Rebecca Ferguson. I was absolutely floored by the uniqueness, soulfulness and quality of her voice, so I spent the next few weeks listening to clips of this girl.<br /><br />Now I am a fan of classic soul artists like Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Roberta Flack and I also listen to the classic singers like Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Adele but I must say that for some reason I still don't understand, Rebecca Ferguson moves me like no other artist has ever done.  This girl's voice is absolutely the most soulful and addictive voice out there now.<br /><br />Her debut album `heaven' is simply what the title denotes. She co-wrote all the songs on the original album and the quality of her song writing is yet another surprise. It is rare to find someone new to the music business with such a voice and also the ability to write great songs with beautiful lyrics. Her voice has been compared to Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Sade and even Macy Gray and Eartha Kitt. The Aretha Franklin comparison has some merit, but in my opinion her voice is just unique and is unmistakably Rebecca.<br />For people who have not yet purchased the Album, there are a few versions out there.  I would suggest you buy the `Deluxe' version with 15 songs.  The additional FIVE songs `Backtrack, Strange & Beautiful, Good days, Bad Days, I'll Count the Days and Take care' are truly gems of soul.

Both women in his book are so damaged by their upbringing, it is really quite sad. Shirley MacLaine has a lot of symptoms of a bi polar personality. Wonder why Sachi's therapist wasn't more of a help to her in regards to her unstable mother. Sachi's need for approval, one has to wonder, will it ever be satiated? Such a revolving door of men, makes your head spin...

0891419063|5.0|My dad graduated from high school in 1943, at the height of World War II.  He immediately joined the merchant marine in order to dodge the draft.  He was never apologetic about his decision; as he used to explain, \\"Soldiers are cannon fodder.\\"  Dad was a conservative Republican, but he had no illusions about war.  He always distrusted generals and politicians who concoct reasons to send young men to their deaths.<br /><br />\\"With the Old Breed\\" puts my dad's draft-dodging into perspective.  Written by a Marine veteran of Peleliu and Okinawa, the book is an unsentimental, unpretentious, and utterly horrifying memoir of infantry combat in the Pacific.  Different readers will respond to it differently.  Some will be morbidly fascinated by the images of carnage and dehumanization.  Others will be touched by the tales of camaraderie and courage.  For me, the book worked mainly as a phenomenology of hell.  It shows in up-close and excruciating detail how men were broken, brutalized, and killed by the war machine, the way raw materials are used up in a factory.  The machine put little value on the soldiers it consumed because it knew they could always be replaced.  As Dad understood, they were cannon fodder.<br /><br />Every American over the age of 17 should read this book.  They should then donate their copy to a local high school library, or give it to a young man or woman who is thinking of joining the military.  Save a life.  Stop the machine.<br /><br />PS:  In case some right-wing Amazon readers want to leave a vile comment calling my dad a coward, they should know that his war years were spent sailing on Liberty ships in the Pacific, bringing supplies to the troops who did the fighting.  (He also brought a large shipment of booze to MacArthur's headquarters staff, a story he loved to tell.)  He did more to support the war against Japan than 99.99 percent of American conservatives have done to support the so-called War on Terror.

On Off The Record, Karl has gone back in time in some ways but also has once again managed to set the bar even higher.  The sounds coming through my speakers when this CD is in the player are as close to electronic heaven as one could get.  Melodies, rhythms, basslines, bleeps and blips... they're all here and it's as if Karl was channeling his &#34;inner-Kraftwerk&#34; while in the studio.  With that said you will love the &#34;breakdown&#34; in Musica Ex Machina as it could have easily gone on for another 5 minutes and I wouldn't have minded!  All the songs on this CD are worth mentioning but my favorites are Rhythmus as it takes you back to the days of Computer World and Home Computer.  Hausmusik, the last track is a happy tune and I find myself hitting the repeat button so I can hear it again and again.  Buy this CD, it will never leave your player!!!!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I was planning to view \\"Djando Unchained,\\" in theaters as I really enjoyed \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"KILL BILL\\" and \\"Inglourious Basterds.\\" Plus, I like the cast. (Mr. Tarentino really knows how to choose the creme de la creme for his movies). However, I read that Jamie Foxx, a fine actor, said something blasphemous at the Soul Train Awards, and I thought, \\"I'm NOT going to spend money on this film. I might as well see it for free when it's released On Demand via XFinity.\\"<br /><br />However, someone I know bought the movie on DVD, and I decided to watch it, as I would not have to spend my money on it. I just finished viewing it 10 minutes ago.<br /><br />I loved the movie. Mr. Tarentino knows how to write a great story, of which PULP FICTION, KILL BILL and Inglorious Basterds serve as proof. Academy Award winners Jaime Foxx & Christoph Waltz lead an all-star cast in a literal bloodbath of bounty-hunting fun. Samuel L. Jackson really steals the show in the second half of the picture, as Calvin Candie's right-hand slave. Even the original Django makes an appearance. Plus, there are several musical & visual Western references, and a slice of a certain 1970's black-cop movie for you blaxploitation lovers. If you're a lover of Quentin Tarentino, Westerns and or blaxploitation films, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />My only quibble is with the pairing of God's Name with a mild curse word. \\"Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.\\" Why do film-makers feel the need to blaspheme our Lord's Name in movies these days? It's like nails on a chalk-board to me. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.<br /><br />Rated R (strong graphic violence & strong language).
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a very good friend and I loved it!  There is so much detail and a broad story, but it's not hard to keep up with.  I will be recommending this book to everyone I can!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I downloaded this a couple weeks ago and really like this. I would swap out some of the extraneous stuff like news for weather related information like average temps for this time of the year. The graphics of hourly temp is not very useful.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child hits the nail on the head here. His plots are beievable and totally possible in the world we live in now.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|This is a great movie. Daniel Day Lewis does an amazing job. I can't believe it took me so long to see this. Some memorable moments in this film. Enjoy.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't understand why Amazon sent message I would like this book, but I finished reading it, although I thought every character in the book was disgusting.  I will not recommend it for book club.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Loved the ease of searching for this classic Yul Brynner movie.  Your search engine also provides interesting to related movies that I might be interested in.  Pricing and ease of ordering were also a deal-clincher!  Great movie!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Very happy with this purchase. No problems at all with the order and the Homeland DVDs were just as expected. Makes a great gift.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|just a really good story with a very good plot, easy reading but not simple...wish i could read it again, but i cannot do that as i will never forget it..
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was a little skeptical about purchasing this workout dvd, however, I love it! I love that I do not have to work out for hours a day. I have only been doing this for 3 days but I really love it. I hate how you have to listen to her talk for about 5 minutes before you can start the workout but other than that I have no complaints. I also like that it has 3 levels so you could essentially do each level for 30 days and not get bored with it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The movie is excelent and the blu-ray version its the perfect match. The extras includes are perfect to enjoy more the movie
B0062NAX1U|5.0|loved it. i watched it twice and will continue to watch it. i recommend that all fathers watch it with their family.
B00466HNHM|5.0|The Bodygurad is one of Whitney's best performances. You can tell she is in her prime with her career. She and Kevin Costner are outstanding in their performances. I love the performances throughout the movie most. I have watched this movie so many times I practically know it word for word. If you are a real music lover, this movie is addictive. The storyline is believable as you watch a beautiful relationship unfold.<br /><br />Although the main character is successful and has everything a woman could want, there are some things money simply cannot buy. She learns to allow her new Bodygurad the opportunity to protect not only with her life but her heart as well.<br /><br />I was excited when the movie was released on the blu ray but the quality was not up to standard. I thought the picture would be clearer.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Denzel Washington is at his best, one of his best performances. Would recommend this movie to all.
B008B68IEA|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!!! I think it is adorable, there are a lot of small parts for sure.
B004GYY714|4.0|wide variety of satations i like the variety of choices irecommend it to anyone who wants a wide variety of satations.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Amazing and almost unreal. I have always been a cynic, but this book makes me feel as if I underestimated how corrupt and false our government and big business have been over the last century. Another book that should be required reading.
B00A4TKDKY|4.0|I am a fan of the blues, which I grew up listening to, the sounds of Mr. Buddy Guy are great still, I had not found any of his CD's until I decided to take a look at what might be available on  Amazon.com. I am so glad I did, when I listen to this CD I sometimes close my eyes and imagine myself sitting in his club and having a great time in that environment.
B00BI745AA|2.0|I had expected some dialog outside of singing... The pacing of the movie seems off. It wasn't a good fit for a casual movie to watch.
B000002VMD|5.0|What is there to say, its outstanding, many of the songs still bring tears of joy when I listen to them, she had such a powerful voice.  I have played it numerous times,  I love her voice on this particular CD. Amazon.com is the place for me  to go for music of the past, its home for me.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have long loved the music here and have seen it live twice; while this film has minor deviations from the stage version in terms of song presentation, it does otherwise bring the play to life in front of me on my schedule in ways that the soundtrack (even the Dream Cast recording) just can't quite get to.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|nothing at all like youtube not even a section to search all videos totally sucks I mean there are sections for everything but not a simple search bar do not recommend
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The story was slow in the beginning and middle but went really fast I n the end. It was a nice story that showed what it was like to live with a controlling abusive husband.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It glitches, and you have to keep download it over and over when it doesn't work. But the only decent-ish youtube app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book! This is one of those books that you just can't put down. I highly recommend this books for teens and adults alike!
B003O86FMW|4.0|It is difficult to seperate out the three books in trilogy. Setting that aside, I like the character development of Katniss. She becomes an almost Joan of Arc character. As a heroine she is often powerless and vulnerable. Well written and enjoyable.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The game is awesome the slender man comes when you collect about 3 to 4 pages. Really scary and hard. But I wish there where more locations.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|One of the central themes and my favorite parts of these stories is the idea of standing up against tyranny. The subtle and truth behind this story is how its small things, usually unintended actions of small defiances that make a difference. The Muslim revolution in the Middle East began with at fruit stand. The Civil Rights movement began with a tired woman who just wanted a seat. Big change can be affected when seemingly unimportant people make small acts of defiance. Well written and well ended I loved love loved these books.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|It will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling inspired. A great watch, sure to win some major awards this year!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Loved the fact that it was a woman who nailed down the location, I would have never known that if it weren't for the movie.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Zero Dark Thirty', was quite an experience. Though sharp in its production and direction and largely accurate in depicting the events that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden, it went ballistic bad in depicting everyday life on the streets of Pakistan.
B009X01ELC|5.0|The case fits perfectlu and is well made.  We are well pleased with this purchase.  I would recommend this case for the kindle fire 8.9&#34;.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I'm not done with the book yet, and I'm thankful for that. It's great reading and the topic is compelling.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is a wonderful, wonderful writer, don't get me wrong, but I wanted more insight into her own life than she provided.
B00AM0HPDS|5.0|Her music brings a new perspective to the music world.  She's young and talented -- still hope out there for musicians/artists.<br /><br />Saw her live, and she's just as good, if not better!
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Buy it; you'll like it! One of the most innovative and listenable albums of the year. You'll become an instant fan.
B000N4SHOE|3.0|Rene Z...just doesn't come across as a Brit  poor try at the accent, after you get by that, it's not bad, the animation of the bunnies is a bit distracting, just stick to real actors is always the best bet.....
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Kinda just wanted to buy it to say I have it :) but its a good movie to watch with friends
0307949486|3.0|I heard great things about this book, so I decided to check it out.  One thing I was told was that it really takes a long time to get into, in this, the first book of the series.  That was very true.  In fact, I normally will only read a book that I can't put down.  This book, I couldn't wait to put down.  It truly took me probably 6-8 weeks to read this book.  It does not get good until the end as far as I'm concerned.  I did read the sequels and they were better, but I would say not as good as everyone makes them out to be.  Sorry, but not really a page-turner.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|The only thing negative I can say about Spartacus is it is so suspenseful you will want more than 4 seasons. Watch from the beginning. A lot of foul language, homo scenes. Otherwise it is excellent. I don't know how it is rated but it is not for kids. Ancient Rome took the path that America is going down today. Cant wait to watch season 4.
1400067820|1.0|Read this book to learn from a very smart and learned man about a lot of peripheral things(science, history, religion, etc), but don't be fooled---if this book is about a neologism, \\"antifragile\\", then it is both trivial and wrong.  It is trivial because a mostly tedious 423 pages of screed badly in need of redaction are about just one obvious thing--encapsulated by the old adage \\"that what doesn't kill you just makes you stronger\\".  Taleb's genius is that he is able to keep the ball rolling for so long about so little.  And then there is the embarrassing detail that the book is simply wrong, to wit, nothing is antifragile in the end.  Indeed, everything will be terribly broken and smashed to bits in time into the tiniest little pieces imaginable---atoms and subatomic particles.  This is guaranteed by the second law of thermodynamics.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very erotic read. Don't read this book if you are trying to sleep. You won't be able to put it down.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|seriously. as you progress the game re-sets itself, deleting all your progress, good game, they just need to fix the glitch!
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|Great music and lyrics.  The voices of all the artists blend so well. I even enjoyed the voice of Bob Dylan as it went well with the others
0062238868|5.0|this book was a very good book i finished in two days.  I could not put it down and would recommend this book to everyone.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|It was a well acted and touching film.  I felt heartbroken by the outcome.  It seem like a true story.  I wonder if it happened.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love it! always on it and playing it. my horse is awesome and amazing. #love my horse # its the best
B0091Q82L8|5.0|a great &#34;companion&#34; to live at leeds..considered one of the greatest live albums of all time.  this is quite similar to live at leeds..if you're a who fan, i think you'd dig it...so glad this was &#34;un-earthed!&#34;
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book will make a perfect movie. The kind you laugh with smile at and cry with.  I loved it.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|oh come on....do i really have to explain 2112?? if you are a fan of rush and this album...it's beyond cool! the 5.1 sounds great on my system! immerse yourself!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This is the third book I have read by John Green and I just cannot get enough of him!! An Abundance of Katherines is a story of finding out your real purpose; not what you think your life needs to be about. I would recommend this book to anyone. A beautifully written story that is as unique as its characters. I love it.
B006O6FK2W|5.0|The shipping was wonderful. I had it shipped to another state and ordered the gift wrap. This was really helpful for me.<br />My grandson loved it.<br />I would highly recommend this product if your son, or grandson is into this kind of thing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This version is old we should be able to get Redstone have minecarts endermen and have caves and newer stuff and have it better like the actual minecraft
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Just a quick placeholder review for later:<br /><br />Blu Ray quality is awesome.  It isn't the best HD picture, but sound is clean and the picture itself is vibrant and pulpy.  Christoph Waltz is awesome.  The action is zany, the story is quite well told.<br /><br />The digital copy included is HD, thank the heavens.  This is one heck of an entertaining movie.  It could have been cut down a little, but aside from that this is a quintessential Tarantino experience.<br /><br />9/10
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game is TERRIBLE!!!!!!! You cant even sleep on this version. Just pay the stupid $6.99 for minecraft. DO NOT DOWNLOAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004NELBPC|2.0|I am removing it from my Kindle Fire because font is tiny and I can not adjust it any longer.  I am now reading on browser.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very good I use it every day checking out the local weather and where my father lives  good job thanks
141690977X|5.0|I bought this book in 2001 for a best friend who wasnt too bright when it came to men.  Now twelve years later, divorced and back to dating again, I thought perhaps I could read it too.  It couldn't hurt.  I laughed through a lot of it because I liked Greg's point of view.  He can be brutal but there is reason to be.  There are a lot of foolish women out there!  I will definitely pass this book on to my female friends who will need it.  In the meantime, it's been two years since my divorce and I'm still hesitant about dating again.  There are very few good men left and I'm not one to give up the goods, which makes it that much harder for me to date.  Thanks Greg! You were very entertaining.  I got a good laugh but I am proud to say that I'm glad I'm not stupid about men.  I definitely don't mind being choosy and I know when I'm being \\"jerked\\" around.  Thanks to both you and Liz.
B007SGM084|2.0|I had heard so many mentions of the Fifty Shades series via the media I mistakenly assumed it was well written and worthwhile. Sadly, I was mistaken. These books are nothing but a modern take of the old Harlequin romance novels. Beautiful innocent girl meets rich handsome loner who sweeps her off her feet but can't love her because he is damaged goods. But love prevails and they live rich and happy ever after. Pathetic. Such a disappointment.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I did enjoy watching this Academy Award winning musical.  I think I did expect more because of the ravings for this musical, but I still did enjoy it.
0345529057|5.0|Much better than the cinematic version.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Didn't become much smear after watching this movie but it was very entertaining and suspenseful! I do highly recommend for some intense watching experience
B0096HKZ1M|5.0|I've seen a lot of horror movies in my day, but this one tops them all.<br /><br />I can't seem to find the adjectives to describe this tour de force of re-animated corpse mayhem.<br /><br />These aren't zombies.  The serum \\"re-animates\\" any corpse or body part it is injected into.<br /><br />This is not standard Hollywood.  This is low budget genius.  These back from the dead bodies were doing the watusi and funky chicken in their writhing, twisting mental defectiveness.<br /><br />I found this movie equal parts horrific, fascinating, and hysterical, a combo that not many, if any, of the horror flicks I've seen have ever come close to.  I watched it with my jaw dropped open and my eyes bugging out in disbelief.  Parts of it were downright uproarious.<br /><br />This is wild, wild stuff.  No horror enthusiast should miss this, nor should any cult movie fanatic.  It combines the best of both worlds.<br /><br />I would never have purchased this ordinarily, never having heard of it before now, but thanks to having Amazon Prime, I was highly entertained, horrified and amused for an hour and a half at no charge. This is almost beyond belief in some ways.<br /><br />Example of the dialogue:  \\"Daddy, why are you acting this way?  What's wrong?\\" \\"He's dead.\\"<br /><br />The highlight, in a movie full of highlights, was a scene combining one naked lady tied to a table, one headless corpse, one head...let's just say I thought I had seen it all, but I was soo wrong.<br /><br />How great to laugh out loud while being disgustingly horrified at the same time.<br />The acting is pretty campy too. Great modern low budget grindhouse at its best.  This is an absolute must see movie!
B005RZ8W94|5.0|Awesome, just like seeing them in person which is something I have done numerous times.  Very cool to see everything up close and personal.  They do speak danish in between songs but that is not something that bothered me at all.  Plus there is the possibility of watching with English subtitles.
B0085A9J18|4.0|The only reason to watch this movie is to immerse yourself in glorified violence.  If that's your goal, then you won't be disappointed.  The action scenes are fast, intense and well choreographed, and it's a pleasure to watch rising star Iko Uwais in action (he reminds me of Tony Jaa).  The story (such as it is - it's an action flick after all) revolves around a rookie cop who's a member of a SWAT-type unit tasked with taking down a notorious crime lord who lives on the top floor of a tenement building.  The building is full of every kind of low-life imaginable, and soon the assault team is fighting for their lives as the crime lord turns everyone in the building against them.<br /><br />The problem I have with this movie is that it doesn't keep up its momentum.  The first half of the film is hard-hitting and relentless as the assault team is surrounded and has to fight room-to-room, floor-to-floor.  The gunplay is for the most part well done.  Then, the movie transitions into martial arts mode, and despite some spectacular fights, the tension isn't sustained.  Another problem I have with this movie is how the transition from gunplay to martial arts is made.  After the assault team is reduced to a mere handful of officers, they start discarding weapons left and right.  I know, it's a martial arts film, but it still has to make sense.  If I were surrounded by crazed killers, I sure as hell wouldn't be deliberately dropping my weapons.  Furthermore, it's just too convenient that once the police lose their weapons, the bad guys start attacking with edged/blunt weapons and bare hands.<br /><br />It's not a perfect action film, but don't let that stop you from watching this.  The fight scenes are a delight to watch, and bad guys are dispatched in some interesting ways.  Get your testosterone fix here.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Was so excited to read these and got them for the price of 1 regular book for my kindle, absolutely amazing.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|In \\"Django Unchained,\\" director Quentin Tarantino combines an assortment of film genres into one neat package.  A drama about the pre-Civil War institution of slavery and an indictment of its inherent inhumanity, it is also an old-fashioned Western complete with gunfighter, a dark comedy, a splatter flick, and an action/adventure.<br /><br />Former dentist and current bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) buys the freedom of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) because he can identify the men Schultz is hunting.  As Schultz trains Django to be a deputy bounty hunter, a genuine bond forms between them.  Django learns quickly and helps Schultz kill several wanted men.<br /><br />Tarantino lets scenes go on long after their point has registered.  He appears so infatuated with his own dialogue that he fails to trim the excess for artful pacing, and the movie sags far too often.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"Django Unchained\\" is Christoph Waltz, who knows how to get the most out of his dialogue. His is the best-developed character in the picture.  Intelligent, compassionate, and ruthless, Schultz is an interesting mix.<br /><br />Foxx gets us to root for Django, but there is a tentativeness in his performance, almost as if he can't bring himself to immerse himself fully in slave mentality.  He's far more convincing in the later scenes, when Django has transformed from cowering slave to self-assured gunfighter.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio has a meaty role as Calvin Candie, a plantation owner whose favored sport is pitting two strong slaves against each other in a fight literally to the death. Samuel L. Jackson plays Candie's elderly slave and partner in slave mistreatment.  Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill, Dennis Christopher, Russ Tamblyn, Tom Wopat, Franco Nero, James Russo, and Tom Savini all show up in small roles, and Don Johnson has a sizable part as plantation owner Big Daddy.<br /><br />Special features on the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include featuretteson the spaghetti Western tradition, production designer Michael Riva, the picture's costume designs, and the soundtrack.
B009CPJHY4|1.0|I bought this for my 75-year old mom. We watched it together, expecting something uplifting and fun. Fools for believing the previews. Instead, I was embarrassed for the characters and their sour lives. And my mom was appalled that people could be so bitter and dour. Perhaps it's British humour that doesn't translate to American sensibilities. But it made everyone look pretty unappealing and one-dimensional, the Indian characters as well.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|As always the service of amazon was on time and without problems.  The knife itself is heavy and built for usage, enough said.  I gave the knive on four starts due to it handle.  Why have such a quality knife and add a plastic handle???
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|This is an awesome group.  Music is catching.  The group is so unique and energetic.  Buy this cd and you will love it.
B005ILYWN2|4.0|This takes the missing/hidden video log in a completely different direction.  These actors and writers, and the whole film crew do so much with so little.  If Hollywood had 1/10th the imagination as them, what the put out would be so much better.<br />Good job to Otto and his crew!
B004BLDD9Y|3.0|Well packaged and worked immediately upon installation.  Took one star because the bulbs do not have protective silicone coating or similar and feel fragile like a regular bulb.  Took the other star because they are definitely on the cool side of white.  Newer CREE warm white 800 lumen bulbs are warmer and have the silicone, but they are a few bucks more expensive.
B00555Z2QW|5.0|It's a very good album of B&S. I love the songs, the sound, the realisation of this album and vinyl give depth.
B005HSL626|1.0|The game is just pointless.  I mean only to some people of course but it's. just not all that entertaining to me.  My sister loves it but I really just dont understand why.  Sorry
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Baldacci takes an almost implausible, complicated story that makes you whip through the pages to see how it can possibly work out well in the end. The only reason I rated it a 4-star instead of 5 is that I didn't have the time to read it in one sitting.  I consequently kept confusing some of the characters, so I would have to re-read some passages to remember who was who.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|Iron Maiden's live album En Vivo was released in March of 2012.<br />I know there are many people who go on complaining and crying about Iron Maiden releasing \\"yet another live album and live DVD\\" but it is in the live setting that Iron Maiden's true colors are shown. En Vivo sees Iron Maiden (which (as of 1999) consists of Bruce Dickinson on vocals; guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers; bass player Steve Harris and drummer Nicko McBrain) perform towards the end of the 2010/11 Final Frontier Tour in April of 2011 in Santiago, Chile. Brilliantly recorded and mixed by Kevin Shirley (who co-produced as always with Steve Harris), this is one of the best modern live albums recorded in the 21st century (as I found out when I bought the CD in June, 2012 before giving that copy to a friend after my older brother was kind enough to buy me another copy whilst he was visiting me for a week).<br />We begin things with the medley of \\"Satellite 13\\"/\\"The Final Frontier\\" which kicks things off superbly. The former was played on the PA as the band hits the stage and the latter is an excellent rendition of The Final Frontier's title cut. Only gripe is why split it in two when they are meant to be played as one. We then go into a stellar version of the song that follows on The Final Frontier which is \\"El Dorado\\". Next is \\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\" which is always great live. Next is \\"The Talisman\\" which is arguably better than its studio counterpart. Continuing with another track from The Final Frontier this time out o \\"Coming Home\\". We then have a brilliant version of \\"Dance of Death\\". We then have a brilliant version of \\"The Trooper\\". We close the first CD with an excellent version of \\"The Wicker Man\\" although the version on Rock In Rio is hard to top!<br />Disc two begins with the live version of \\"Blood Brothers\\" which is excellent although hard to top the version on Rock in Rio. Next is \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\" which is superb live and a great song as well. Next is a brilliant version of \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" which is probably my second favorite version after the one on Maiden England. Next is an excellent version of \\"Fear of the Dark\\" which is always great live. We close the show with the band's theme song \\"Iron Maiden\\" and a great live version it is. The encore section begins with a brilliant version of \\"The Number of the Beast\\". We then go to an excellent rendition of \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\". We close the proceedings with an excellent version of \\"Running Free\\".<br />Iron Maiden's En Vivo! is a stellar live album that is up there with Live After Death, Rock in Rio and Death on The Road and has plenty of photos of the band on stage. Also, on a somber note, this was one of the last recordings brilliantly mastered by audiophile mastering engineer George Marino before his death in summer 2012. En Vivo is an awesome live album!<br />Highly recommended!s a brilliant version of \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" which is probably my second favorite version after the one on Maiden England.

B00B1OWEVC|4.0|If you are expecting nine inch nails you will be disappointed, it's a totally different sound much more mellow, but a good cd
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun and easy game. If you need to take a break and come back to the game later there are no penalties. Great graphics too.
0345803493|3.0|If you want a decent ending, don't read the last 22 pages... Who ends a story with \\"thanks for reading, that's all for now...\\" ? Those last pages killed the series for me but I still recommend others to read the final book for closure.
B005PK553C|5.0|American horror is a very hard to predict show. Every week it seems like something unexpected twist happens. It's very different from everything else I watch. In a good way
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I could n't wait for the next segment!  We watched two at a time.  Everyone felt bad when Dan Stevens died (Matthew Crowley)..  Felt like we lost a friend!<br /><br />Whoe thing was done excellently!
B0026772N8|5.0|I choose this rating because it is very interesting and it tells something about the pitfalls in life,  It is then possible to prevent some of this unpleasant occurances, It is useful to anyone who wants to improve his mental state.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Boring with zero character development. Plot seems borrowed from many successful books. Really Sorry I wasted the time and money.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I read the last book first, so this was great to put with it now I know. So I am going to read the rest. These books are really really great. I love bones an cat they are great together. Really what a book.........
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|So much hype..we thought it was gonna be good.  We fell asleep multiple times.  Too bad..we really liked the cast and wanted to like the movie.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|An easy film to enjoy with enough twists so I didn't know exactly what would happen next.  In the end it finished as I expected.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I had reads many of Jo Nesbo's books long before I read this one pity really because this happened to be the last I read felt as if I was going back in time ! But very good just the same..............
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|What a waist of good film - I didn't even bother to finish watching the movie it was so bad....
B00632HWOG|5.0|Some kindle apps can be a pain in the butt but i find this app to be well made. Its only an email app so it should be anyway...
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show in the third season continues to entertain the viewer.  The writers and director are still on top of their game and the show continues to be exciting and unpredictable.  Good entertainment.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|I officially hate tarrantino at this point. He lures in big name actors then produces a horrible movie yet again. Never again loser!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Look for the moving talking speaker bear, very funny. The show has great actors too. Each episode is well scripted.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented this to watch with the kids then watched it again cuz it was so good. I shouldve bought it...
B008602KQI|5.0|Good story line. The action was fast. Visually impressive as the multiple worlds were represented. Make you want to see the rest of the books as movies
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|This app is completely weird and difficult to properly navigate. It would be helpful to consult customers before wasting their time on a cheap app
B007T99ENE|5.0|I have read everything Ian McEwan has written and I enjoyed this as much as any of the others. He is a wonderful writer who has a great emotional pull. Just a great book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It is good to learn your own language as well as others. Thanks for sharing this informative and interesting book.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I bought this movie for my wife who has been a Les Miserables fan since she was young. The music is really great, and this is a movie that's not something I'd generally watch, but was thoroughly enjoyable.
B00008NRI7|5.0|I was not sure if I would like this film at first, but after watching with my wife, I really enjoyed this film.  The story line is very good and like many other films of this style or genre.
B009G3T01M|5.0|I bought this album because I enjoyed the song, the Thrift Shop. What ended up happening is that there are many more great songs, in fact, thrift shop is not my favorite song on the album, I have found I like something from every track on this album.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|If you like Depeche Mode's old albums you will just LOVE this one.  I think buying the Deluxe album was a great deal, as you get added songs and storybook too.
B000W27AE0|4.0|There are few songs on this album that are not stellar, I have been a fan of Tears for Fears since I was in grade school. How can you not love some of the classics, so many good songs, if you are a fan, this is a must buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|app is fun. not a huge fan of the time sensative games, I would rather have to complete more tasks instead of paying to get a head I. the game. but other wise fun to play.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book kept my attention and i finished it all on one night!! Could not put it down!  Check it out!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We started with season 1 and liked it so much we watched at least two episodes every day until we caught up. Now we are waiting for Season 4. It is interesting that the story needs to be adapted when cast members decide to leave the show. At times interesting and at times a gripping drama. Enjoyed learning about the setting location which is a real home that still has 20 servants. Was about 60 during the setting of the story.
B001MTENOC|4.0|I love the concept in this book... evidently there are people of various ages all over the country that have similar stories... it's a neat thought that when this body wears out I will join with my peers & discuss just what was learned this time around, & where I should go for my next lifetime of lessons!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We heard this was an interesting series. So we started with season 1 and liked it so much we watched at least two episodes every day. At times interesting and at times a gripping drama. Enjoyed learning about the setting location which is a real home that still has 20 servants. Was about 60 during the setting of the story.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I am so happy to be able to get books like this for free. It is a very long book, so it is good to have it on the Kindle.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|love the game had a problem with loss of advanced status due to game malfuntion had to start from beginning .
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It was okay. It got a little too technical at times. If I didn't already believe in heaven, this book would not have convinced me.
B005IGZUTC|4.0|The I heart books continue, this time in Vegas. Who wouldn't like a quick read that takes place in one of America's most hedonistic towns? Great way to while away the hours on a plane trip, an afternoon off or just a few hours while the kids are at soccer practice.
B008JFUO36|1.0|This movie is as off beat as Tom Cruise himself.  Sure this was a action filled science fiction movie that moved quickly  with lots of \\"Booms\\" and \\"Bangs\\", lots of technology talk that nobody really understood in the movie theater. Let's not even mention Tom Cruise's lousy acting. This movie moved fastly and was terribly confusing until halfway through the movie. It was one of the worst movie's I have ever seen. For a movie that had so many special effects it was boring and all over the place.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|Maybe one of the clearest books on presentations I've ever read. Incredibly simple and easy to read but covering up a broad range of subjects. Full of practical tips,  actual examples as well as personal experiences. Just brilliant. It's outstanding how it wraps you up without visual aid or pictures only message. Other books on presentations can explore more deeply some specifics as how to build a story or how to design your slides, but if you are looking for a big picture, for a road map of presentation, this can be your book
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Perfect, ordered a year ago. Good quality, an amazing sound. You can really feel that you're in the show. Excellent product for any directioner
B00B6ELPIU|3.0|I love the knife. I have for a really long time. And I'd imagine if you're reading this, you do too.<br />So for love's sake, buy the album. It's worth more than any other 3 star album in the world.<br /><br />My problems.<br />I'm really open about my music. Nothing is really too weird for me. The problem is, this album isn't consistent. Not even close.<br />You start off with \\"A tooth for an eye\\" And it's AWESOME. It's something I haven't heard from Karin, or expected. An almost completely natural song, devoid of insane voice alteration or electronic noise. (Sure, i'm sure most of it was computer generated, but it could be played on real instruments, fairly easily.) And seeing something so natural, but so fitting, is beautiful. But, HAH, that doesn't last.<br /><br />You're thrown into \\"Full of fire\\". Some sort of trance noise techno mess, filled with distorted voices. Creating an insanely busy song, that is also, really awesome. Problem is, It's a complete contrast to the first song. Not to mention, I hate it when artist's stick the \\"best\\" songs right at the beginning.<br /><br />Than third, You go into \\"A cherry on top\\" A song, that's just noise, up until the end. It's haunting, and soothing at the same time. Quite beautiful. Problem? It's again, a total flip from \\"Full of fire\\".<br /><br />And that's my problem. If they had created an entire album, filled with any of these 3 theme's, (Natural, Noisy distorted techno, or haunting soundscapes) I would have ATE IT UP. Problem is, It's not. It's a jumbled mess. I'm never in the mood to listen to this album, because it's barely an album, it's just a bunch of random songs.<br /><br />My favorite artist is Beck. When I feel sad, I listen to Sea Change. When I feel silly, I listen to Midnight Vultures. When I feel Grungy, I listen to Mellow Gold. When I feel like pop, I listen to The Information. When I feel empty, I listen to One Foot In the Grave. Thing is. All his albums have a feel. A tone. A theme that he sticks to.<br />The Knife was doing a fantastic job at this, up until now. I mean, Silent Shout blended seamlessly, while being filled with very unique songs.<br /><br />This album had so much potential as an album, but it fell flat on it's face.<br /><br />But as a collection of 14 random songs. Its radical. And worth picking up.<br /><br />But not before you're completely sick of The Knifes previous albums.
0007444397|4.0|Bought this a year ago, It came perfect but too late. BTW loved the book, excellent quality, good images. Everything I wanted
B00355L2TU|5.0|On day three of the 30 day shred. I'm feeling it! It is getting easier. Some of the moves aren't very challenging most likely due to my experience with vinyasa yoga but her 1, 2, 3 system makes you feel the workout fpr sure
B006OAB432|5.0|This review is about the sound quality of the vinyl record. This is one of my favorite new vinyl records. The songs are catchy on the radio, but the vinyl gives a whole new dimension. This isn't a crappy 44khz CD transferred to vinyl. It sounds awesome and the details of the lead singers vocals shine through. I love his voice. A lot of feeling comes through. Drums and piano sound like analog. It's not quite as good as an all analog recording but it's pretty damn good. I think this record is the leader in modern high quality digital recording transferred to vinyl.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|They don't really know where their food comes from. I show this in my environmental science classes every year. It always shocks them and makes them think.
B0081336FO|5.0|Hooked by \\"the Pink Lady\\" episode I have watched every episode since. The two playing Holmes and Watson are first rate. Best of all are the 21at century twists that add charge and excitement to already riveting episodes. Can't wait for more!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Liked this till it stopped working, tried reinstalling it and didn't fix the problem must have a major glitch. I had bought the app and it stopped working so I tried the free one same glitch.
B0091WUZJE|5.0|Directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne, the Searchers is an excellent Western.  Excellent vista's and views, decent dialogue.  The only negative is that the film tends to drag a bit in the middle.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I chose this book due to a good review in a magazine; however, I was not sure that it was my kind of read.  I was delightfully surprised - lots of history (not my strong suit), but the author's characters got me really involved in the story and I am also learning so much.  I actually found myself caught up with the characters and each one's story.
B002GNDXY4|5.0|I started the series with my 9 year old grandson and when he went back home he pressured his parents to let him pick up the series where he and I had left off, so I know he loved it. Who can help booing that boyfriend who always steps in at the last minute and ends up back with Lana Lane after Superman has come so close to stealing her away. The slow revelation of Superman's powers it cool too.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragon Story has a lot of cute dragons, and the quests act as a tutorial for anyone who hasn't played this type of game before. Although cash is a little slow to build at first, it does seem to catch up eventually. One really nice feature, for me, is the help it lends in building community. You can easily visit lots of other islands, and ask other \\"caretakers\\" to be neighbors, then you can gift each other gold and other things that you might otherwise have to pay real money for, making this game truly free, at least as far as I have played it. You can also contact people directly via text or by their Storm8 ID. Some players will also share advice to help lower-level players along. The graphics are colorful, and some real creativity went into the dragon designs--some are cute, some silly, some stunningly beautiful. With both adults in my family out of work, I am very grateful to the designers for offering this for free, but if I had known how much I would enjoy this, and had any money, it would have been worth paying something for. As a free game, it is/was like a little gift, brightening a bad time. (If you buy,invite LadyMeadhbha as a neighbor, and I will share some gold with you!)
B008KE3960|5.0|This is probably the plane game of the year. I love it. 5 stars definitely,<br />I mean, who can't like this game?! I play it everyday!!
B007HC3LHS|1.0|The story just kept jumping back and forth in time and it was very hard to keep track of it.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|The Batman is awesome. And this was the best Joker ever. Has violence and is a bit dark but compared to many movies with this much action it's great for teens.
B000H4JGZY|1.0|Music was to my liking.  Guess I am too old for this type of music, but I certainly did not like this cd.  Have heard his other recordings and they were good but this one was terrible.<br /><br />Arleda Broad
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|,Great game!!  Fun for the parents and our kids.  It's easy to pass the  time with this great game.  PLAY ON!  Last words to qualify?
B00B1RB942|5.0|All I'm going to say about this movie is that if you love family movies or even just anime in general you're going to love this movie Period..... With that said I'm not going to spoil this movies plot line or anything you get enough special features with the movies american cast and Japanese to sum up an hour of interviews. Just buy the movie the quality of animation and chars is great in this movie and heart warming. GO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0042816YK|4.0|key to happiness is to accept and love yourself...and food, really good food.  My only complaint is James Franco isn't on screen enough...but that's my own little obsession. Julia Roberts is perfect as always.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album is one of the best albums of Dragons. I cant say it any clearer buy THIS ALBUM! PLEASE PLEASE BUY IT!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Slightly over-the-top theatrical blood, but the plot was gripping, deep, and full of symbolism. A great ride, and not a dull moment.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I hope you all know that this is a great action movie that shows disney can make great sci-fi movies when it really tries to do so. The characters aren't that deap and don't get many lines to flesh them out but still a great movie other then that!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I love this and as long as you go slow with the hot water then cold (sometimes it takes 2 or 3 times) it works perfect.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This album I must say is like country, good people you want to hang around, and great music all in one.
B0081336FO|5.0|I found this series to be very contemporary and just as dramatic and unexpected as the original Sherlock Holmes I watched on Masterpiece Theater...I have been waiting to see season 2 since viewing the first 7 episodes of season 1...Sherlock's hyperactive persona played against the relaxed Watson makes for a very enjoyable session.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Well, I just don't know what some people were expecting in this movie, but I found it to be completely in line with all of the other Die Hard movies... except that, if I am not mistaken, I don't think Bruce's character used some of his typical lines used in all of the other ones...like 'Yippee Kayee (sp?) MF#@%$%*... although he was referred to as a 'cowboy' in the movie. I'll have to watch it again just to see!  ANYWAY.... I totally enjoyed the movie... LOTS of great action (from start to finish) and the usual dry humor!  Bruce is his usual fantastic self! I love this series, plan on buying this movie, too, and totally recommend this it to all of you Die Hard fans!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great way to kill time. Wish I could find my son and add as an ally as he is sitting right next to me.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|If you are a James Bond Fan then this is another must see movie.  I absolutely love Pierce Brosnan portraying James Bond.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have more than one year and half using this app, and I can say that it's part of my life. its simplicity and efficiency makes it one of my most loved and recommended apps..
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable Bond films of all time in my opinion. Lots of drama and action without and over abundance of tech drivel. This movie was much more down to earth. Changing of the guard, although inevitable is a sad point but obviously necessary. Not sure where they will go from here.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I was not able to get into this book as much as I hoped and have in the past.  This book was disappointing.  I like Tempe and this story I found lacking.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a great read - highly entertaining.  I have recommended this book to several of my friends and would not hesitate to recommended it to anyone.  It does have a dark side but it is essential to understand the development of the characters.
B009K86D86|4.0|Bisically we need to know what we eat.. Either fish, beef or chicken and vegestable.. To much additives included in all food we eat.. From antiobitic, chemical or virus... Should  all the farmer and investor worry about the health of consumer nit the money...
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just like pc that you can carry around! Except that there is not spawners and caves other than that, awesome
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|This was a very slow movie. There are a lot of good parts in the movie but the extra content just kills it.About half way through the movie I was no longer interested in the characters and could care less what happens, but I had already paid for the rental and wasted all that time watching the first half that I did finish the movie. I was glad when it was finally over.
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|John Carpenter's status as one of the most legendary directors began with two movies: Assault On Precinct 13 and the horror masterpiece, Halloween. His legacy continues with the cult classic, The Fog: A story about a small fishing town in California that is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary when suddenly strange things begin to happen. The town's priest, Father Malone, finds a diary written by his ancestor revealing to him the dark history behind Antonio Bay. The next day, following the deaths of 3 local fisherman under mysterious circumstances, Nick Castle and Elizabeth Solley, a drifter on her way to Vancouver, along with the town radio personality, Stevie Wayne, delve deeper into the mystery behind the supernatural fog that has begun to sporadically appear, soon discovering that vengeful spirits have risen from the deep to seek revenge and reclaim what is rightfully theirs.<br /><br />The 80's, known for its favored slasher genre, begins with a movie that forgoes gore, sex and killers with sharp objects for what critics and fans alike can be proud to have watched, own and proclaim a true horror film. The Fog will enthrall you with a fantastic story, eerie music, characters you can truly invest in and suspense that will leave you on the edge of your seat. If you've never seen this film do what you must in order to see it because it is that good.<br /><br />And remember to look across the water, into the darkness...look for The Fog!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The final book was bittersweet. I really loved it, but Im really hoping this is not the last we will ever hear from these characters.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I have easily read this wonderful book over 40 times!!  3 times the first year, once or twice nearly every year since.  When I am cremated, I want a copy burned with me!  An absolute treasure for older children and adults.  Now its time to read it again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a wonderful game package for those who have a little time to kill. I have really enjoyed many of the games do far. The reason I only give it 4 stars, is because one of the games is impossible to beat. The 45 towers game has tanks that go through a maze of roads to get to your castle. I have so far only been able to rack up a max of 17,500 points and you need 22,500 to beat the game.Some of the tanks  are impossible to blow up!!! This makes the game frustrating and takes all the fun out of it! Otherwise, this is a great set of games.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I have a kindle fire. Every time I try and watch as good quality video it doesn't load. I have been looking for a YouTube app and this is bad. FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|It meets my expectations...I really need a cover for my new kindle and this is perfect.....I would recommend this for anyone
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the convenience of the Bible app!  Easy to use.  I find that I can look up verses and chapters faster.
B00CEIGYAG|3.0|Love both duos... This is oddly less of both bands! This almost sounds Jamiroquai-y (look that word up). Nice groove, glad to hear the HBFS vocal effects... just needs more cowbell! I mean Daft Punk :)
B007THA4FI|5.0|Read it and hate everyone in it except four most unlikely characters. Redemption comes to all, with remorse and revenge mixed in.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I've been using Facebook free for a couple of weeks on my Zeki-Andriod tablet. It seems to work great. I've had no problems with it. I'm surprised at how much Facebook does. It is worth a try if you haven't tried it yet.
B0049GYXDQ|4.0|My almost three year old girl kind of go part of this Disney adaptation of the Prince and the Frog.  I would have waited for her to see it but whatever.  Interesting twist on the story. Should become a relative &#34;classic&#34; over time.
081297381X|5.0|It seems that most Great Works have two characteristics:  they expound only a single central point; and their style is meandering.  Such is the case with this book, which I rank as Almost-Great.    The one central point of The Black Swan is this:  The course of life is governed mainly by events that are unforeseeable and have large consequences.  Why does it take 400 pages to say that?  Well, compare Smith's \\"The Wealth of  Nations\\" (\\"specialization is limited by the extent of the market\\") or Marx's \\"Capital\\" (\\"labor is paid less than it produces\\") or Keynes's \\"General Theory\\" (\\"supply does not create its own demand\\").  We would not say that the tens of thousands of words of elaboration of the central point through narrative and example are wasted.  Nor here.    Anyone who doubts that The Black Swan's point is profound need only listen to so-called experts forecast almost anything-- preachers, economists, Presidents, pundits. Listen carefully and you will, after reading this book, realize that they are projecting from the tiny universe of things they know; or the only slightly-larger universe of things they know they don't know.  Black Swans lie outside of both universes, and are more important than anything within them.    Since most major risk is unknown, it is also unquantifiable. Yet forecasters, especially economic ones, fall into the error of treating it as if it is measurable. Betas and Bell curves rest on the assumption that market risk is subject to the laws of probability, and it is not.    My favorite examples are found in the parade of stock market prognosticators on Bloomberg and CNBC.  Each day, they scramble to say why last month's, or last year's, prognostication was wrong. Or they just ignore their past errors and talk on, as if they never occurred.  They usually sound good doing it, very persuasive.  But they are so full of crap it is comical.    There are exceptions.  Burton Malkiel and Jack Bogle, for example, know the limitations of analysis.  Neither succumbs to the conceit that he can foretell what the price of any stock, or even the market as a whole, will be next month or next year.  Although I've never heard them express it this way, they understand Black Swans.    Taleb writes with a kind of chip-on-the-shoulder humor, a sense of irony that often crosses over into satire.  And he digresses a lot.  Other reviewers are put off  by this.  But most interesting people meander in their dialogue and show sharp edges in their expression.  Conventionality is common.  Profundity is not.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great. You only have to wait 30 seconds for another coin to keep playing. Great time waster. The best game ever.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|The dialogue is sparkling., Emma  Stone is the classmate we always wish we had, or were. You will enjoy the CD
B002OSXDAU|4.0|This was my second read through of the fountainhead and I still like it which I figured would be the case.<br /><br />The characters are compelling and Rand's focus on the heroic is really an inspiring take.  At points she gets a little bit preachy in terms of capitalism being the only vehicle for allowing that type of heroism to be possible.  I don't know if that is the case or not.  I think it is less heavy handed than some of her later works.  The challenges of Roark as a protagonist and an individualist are fun and worthwhile.  If you imagine that there are things out there worth working for and challenging yourself with this could be a book that is worth your time.<br /><br />In the cons like I said it gets preachy about the virtues of capitalism.  It is also a little lengthy though not quite so daunting as a Tolstoy or Hugo work.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I purchased this for my 13 yr. old daughter as a surprise and she was absolutely thrilled! It is just as pictured.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game didn't like that it basically forces you to pay if you want to advance the game. I would rather pay a few dollars up front
B000VYNYN0|4.0|This was a great movie I really liked it, Bruce rilly plays the part well and everything with the dead and all.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Once you get the hang of it, it works pretty well, but it's really not worth the expense.  I could have taken a glass cutter and a ruler and had the same results.  The glass is VERY difficult to separate after cutting, even after multiple times in boiling/ice water.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|Although long, this is an excellent movie. Just don't get to fixated on the facial hair...some of the beards and mustaches are goofy looking. I've watched it multiple times and enjoyed it every time.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|An appalling saga of foul language , ego, arrogance and selfishness. I wonder at you being so unwise as to print such tripe.
159514188X|3.0|I'm being 100% honest: parts of this book I loved. However, parts of it made me frustrated and I realize I'm in the minority with that opinion. I get where the girl was coming from on a few \\"reasons,\\" but some of the reasons were not justifiable enough to hurt the people she had the tapes sent to. Maybe I'm awful for saying that, but I just didn't GET it. At times I felt awful for her and at other times I just didn't understand where she was going with her reasons. Still, this is a good book for parents or teachers to read because it is a realistic picture of some teenagers. I get that this is a reality and that suicide and depression are real problems. I just graduated as an English major at a small university and my department obsessively passed this book around. It is a GREAT option for a book club because of the discussions that can come up.
B009NNGDGU|3.0|Embraced by the Light<br /><br />I paid top price for the book (more than I should have) but was never told about the huge amount of underlining in the book.. The book was referred to me by a friend and well worth reading.
6305165912|5.0|2012 was some anniversary of this movie. There were all kinds of celebrations and talk so I broke down and bought a used, and perfect, DVD on Amazon so I could watch on my own time. NOW, I know what the big deal is about The Big Lebowski! It's a very good movie! So I'm late to the party -- big deal! The Dude Abides!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using it as my main alarm clock for some time now. Please give the author some love and donate some beer money. :)
B000FC13E0|4.0|This book was great.  It's definitely worth your money.  Through the whole book, Crichton keeps you guessing, solving the mystery right along with the main character.  Bravo!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book brought back so many memories of being a teenager. Chbosky does such a great job of recreating all of those emotions and more. I read the reviews before decision to read this book and I have to say I was a little nervous about the letter style this story was written in. I wasn't sure if it would flow well, boy was I wrong. I could not stop reading this book once I started.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just could not stop reading it.I read it in record time.The story drew me in again and I loved it
B00BWJARHO|2.0|This movie wouldn't have been bad if it were an hour and a half long. Almost 3 hours is ridiculous and pretentious. This isn't an assignment, there was no need or requirement to make this 3 hours long, especially when there was no point to doing so. I think it was much better than the past Lord of the Ring movies, but at a certain point, you could tell that all the actors were exhausted and the movie began to lose focus. If I had one wish, it would be for the next movies to come in under 2 hours long. Almost 3 hours without a point is just pushing it. The LOTR movies suffer from the same problem as the Harry Potter films. There is absolutely no point to making them ridiculously long. The audience doesn't benefit, it is more work for the film makers, and theaters can't turn over showings as often. Furthermore, casual fans will simply not bother. A great movie with a great plot can be 3 hours long. This shouldn't be. It has no business being so. In the editing process, a director should see that a film is dragging and start cutting scenes. Peter Jackson is NOT a bad film maker. I've seen his other films, which were fantastic. I have no idea why with LOTR, he is fixated with lengthening the time out?<br /><br />Hopefully, this will change after the somewhat lackluster reviews of the last film, but it's doubtful. I think critics and audiences just figured out what I noticed about the first film, which I walked out of.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story seems so real,I felt like I was there withthem throughout the whole story.It left me wanting much more
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Yes, this was a marvelous series.  Enjoyed the characters, decor, clothing, the interplay between the upstairs and downstairs people.<br /><br />Learned more about that time era.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the story,I fellt like I was drawn in with them.I could not stop reading.I have recommended it to a few friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because you can interact with the horse and play with it and enter competitions. I would reccomend this app for anyone who loves horses.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Really bad movie with way too much profanity and arguing, that did nothing to add to the movie plot. BAD BAD BAD
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This is a very engaging series to watch. I watch it  randomly on Saturday and Sunday mornings on the Soap Net channel , but this is nice to watch them all in order. There is going to be a movie being made in the near future. I know all the Veronica Mars fans will be eagerly anticipating it.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|This is the second unit I ordered.  The first one did not work at all.  The instructions are not written very well.  Leaves a lot to be desired.
0307341577|5.0|Another GREAT book by Gillian Flynn.  Once you start reading this one, expect to stay up late to finish it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I initially felt sorry for the racketeer because he was imprisoned because of his own stupidity but as the story developed, I decided I did not like him or his friends.  The system played &#34;god&#34; with him so he played &#34;god&#34; with the system.  He put together an elaborate plan and it worked.  There were tense moments when the plan might have failed but they persevered.  The FBI finally caught on but it was too late to stop them.  I would not wish to be this racketeer's friend or his enemy.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I have always read Grisham.<br />Now that he is doing this series, I can't wait for the next.<br />He keeps Theodore interesting
0553062182|5.0|I am a French woman, so please forgive my mistakes writing in English. I just want to say that this is probably one of the best book I have ever read. It is brilliantly written, it is so bright, suttle, and profound. I have recognized myself all along, I have been recently diagnosed as a gifted person and hyper-sensitivity is one of the component. I have learnt a lot with this book about hyper-sensitivity and how to deal with it. First of all accepting myself the way I am. Thank you Mrs Aron for your brilliant work, researches, and generous sharing. It is only a pity that our French-Canadian friends translated the title as: \\"Ces gens qui ont peur d'avoir peur\\", which means: \\"These people who are afraid of being afraid\\". This does not sound very accurate to me.
B00821OX98|5.0|I had not heard of this before seeing Seasons one and two on Amazon....<br />The series is well done with each episode pulling you to the next....
B0026IUXME|5.0|The Pianist is a film that should be viewed by all.  Adrien Brody captures the emotion of someone involved in the terrible events of the World War II.  This film is an absolute classic.
B008L5G4I8|4.0|A British murder mystery starring Hercule Poirot who is a retired Belgium detective, who is a war refugee in GB in 1916.<br /><br />I believe that this is her first Piorot mystery novel, and so she is developing the characters Captain Arthur Hastings is on convalescent leave from the British Army, and looking for a good looking woman to fall in love with.  Hastings is willing, but not the sharpest sidekick for Piorot.<br /><br />Hastings assists Poirot in his investigations of the death of the wealthy old woman who owns Styles, a mansion and country house in the English countryside. Hastings is a house guest of one of her sons for a month. She is poisoned with strychnine in the middle of the night, really early morning, and they have to break in the door to her room as it is locked from the inside. Entertaining.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is missing some graphics that would help. Great mystery, not so great Kindle edition.
B005K17RU0|2.0|i liked the when i first got it but I'm not a fan of the recent updates. please go back to the old format.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandchildren love this game, from 5 to 15 and I am enjoying it too.  I will say that as a grandmother it is not as easy for me as it is for the younger kids but I still keep on trying.
B004P7CNE0|4.0|Interesting premise... a drugged society to change our emotions. A couple of nice twists that pleasantly surprise you. I would have liked a little happier ending, but it is entertaining.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great Story well told.....everything I expected<br />Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor and portrayed the roll well - well deserved Award winning performance!
0446580848|5.0|One of his best books ever!! A very fast, informing read.  Sorry to see the book end I loved it so much.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|its an awesome movie every single minute you will be really scared.<br />it has a lot of really scary and creepy scenes.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I liked the movie but I have some concerns about buying instant movies from Amazon. I have Sony Internet TV Model # NSX-GT1 which is an introductory HDTV model powered by Google TV. I often purchase movies to rent from Amazon Instant Movies. First concern I have is that I am unable to figure out whether the movie has closed caption feature before you make a purchase. Secondly, I am not sure if my TV can play HD movies from Amazon. I went through the list of compatible devices - it's hard for me to believe that my TV is not in the list.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Very interesting book.  I learned a lot and I appreciate the way in which this book was written.. The author did a great job in every explanation via using examples and every day wording.  Recommend this book for sure.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Enjoy the game but wish I could buy diamonds with the coins earned. Waiting for energy is no biggy. I just use game for a break now and then.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|The bonus features were an exciting look into the new way this musical was made.  I watched and learned so much more about the movie, actors and people involved in making this.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Starts out kind of slow, but there's really nothing that Tommy Lee Jones is in that's truly boring.  Becomes a little confusing with flashback scenes, but if you're paying attention it's not a big deal.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Any program that is not part of the garbage on tv, plus It is high quality and I hate to see each segment end
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|My son loved Journey to Mysterious Island and has wanted to get the first movie in the series. It is a fun movie for young kids. His favorite scene is the drooling dinosaur. He loves it and has it watched it over and over. He can't wait to see the third movie.
B002J2PB10|5.0|Hot chicks, fast cars, Kurt Russell, Stunt woman from New Zealand...classic Tarantino shots...if you are not a cool person, watching this movie will make you cool.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|After my son read and then I read the book we wanted to watch the movie, but there were a lot of different things that were not in book. Liked book better.
B003FXCSU4|5.0|This book take you on an extraordinary inner journey. There were times that I was completely lost, but then some more information was revealed. I feel that the writer was toying with me, my perceptions. Just when the inner world started to gain solidity, perceptions changed and I was lost again. To separate myself from the characters was nearly impossible. What an extraordinary journey.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|HD Camera it was just not for me, I do not do facebook, and others, so I do not see the use of it.

0385333846|5.0|TIME magazine ranked \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" twelfth on its list of the 100 best novels of the 20th Century (\\"Gone With the Wind\\" was eleventh, \\"Lolita\\", thirteenth). It is an important achievement by any standard, the most significant of Kurt Vonnegut's work.  If a review is in order at this point in time (thirty-six years after its publication) it ought not deal with its merit, that's a given, but should address some aspect of the work that makes it relevant today. At a time when our country is war-logged, tired to death of the war in Afghanistan, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" reminds us of all that is wrong with depending on the military to sort out the world's problems.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim, the hapless World War II Chaplin's Assistant whose experiences toward the end of the war are at the center of Vonnegut's tale, could not have been less suited for active duty. Separated from his unit virtually from the time he reached the front at the Battle of the Bulge, he never got his bearings and soon came to grief. Hurting, in way over his head, Pilgrim wanted to be left to die, but couldn't manage even that.  Roland Weary, a buddy, refused to leave him behind, and bullied him along.  When captured, Weary and Pilgrim were in such sad shape that their captors published photographs of them \\"as heartening evidence of how miserably equipped the American Army often was.\\"  Vonnegut, whose actual World War II service provided much of the raw material for the book, never lets the reader forget the reasons for his antiwar views.<br /><br />These become most clear in the account of the aftermath of the bombing raid on Dresden, the centerpiece of the book. In gross violation of the rules of war, the raid was designed to immolate Dresden's civilian population in the course of burning the city to the ground. Winston Churchill is said to have approved the raid because he wanted to deal with Stalin at the upcoming Yalta Conference from a position of strength. The fact that adverse weather conditions delayed the planned attack until after Yalta did not persuade Churchill to back off. The great old city of Dresden, a place of no military value, one which the Red Cross considered an open city, i.e.  one that would not be bombed, was wiped out.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim was part of a small group of American prisoners who were housed (as Vonnegut had been) in a deep underground meat locker, Slaughterhouse-Five, away from the city center. It is where Pilgrim (and Vonnegut) spent the night of the bombing. \\"There were sounds like giant footsteps above. . . . There was a fire-storm out there. Dresden was one big flame. The one flame ate everything organic, everything that would burn. . . . When the Americans and their guards did come out [the next day], the sky was black with smoke. The sun was an angry little pinhead. Dresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals. The stones were hot. Everybody else in the neighborhood was dead. So it goes.\\"<br /><br />For practical purposes, this gut-wrenching account was for a great many Americans their first accurate look at what had happened to Dresden at the hands of our Eighth Air Force. \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" not only revealed the extent of the atrocity, it makes clear Vonnegut's contempt for our government's efforts to conceal it from us. As Vonnegut writes \\"Even then [back in the days fairly soon after the War] I was supposedly writing a book about Dresden. It wasn't a famous air raid back then in America. Not many Americans knew how much worse it had been than Hiroshima, for instance. I didn't know that either. There hadn't been that much publicity.\\" See the End Note.<br /><br />Vonnegut uses the phrase \\"so it goes\\" to emphasize the finality of death.  It appears at least 84 times in the book including the one quoted above. The editors of the 2009 Dial Press trade paper edition missed a great chance to use it to good purpose in the brief biographical note on the book's back cover. It ends: \\"Mr. Vonnegut passedaway in April 2007.\\" If Vonnegut had been alive to compose that note, he would have added \\"so it goes.\\"<br /><br />End Note. Midway through Chapter 9 of \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" the narrator, alter ego for the author, states \\"the thing was, though, there was almost nothing in the 27 volumes [of the \\"Official History of the Army Air Force in World War Two\\"] about the Dresden raid, even though it was a howling success.\\" So true. The account of operations for the night of February13-14 simply says \\"461 B17s are dispatched to hit the marshaling yard at Dresden (311).\\" The number in parenthesis apparently refers to the number of targets destroyed in the marshaling yard-- a place where\\"railway [cars] are shunted and made up into trains and where engines, carriages, etc. are kept when not in use.\\" Contrast that with the account of operations in the Pacific on August 6, 1945: \\"The world's first atomic attack takes place. . . . At 0915 hours (0815 hours Japan time) the atomic bomb is released over Hiroshima from 31,600 feet (9,632 meters), it explodes 50 seconds later. 80+% of the city's buildings are destroyed and over 71,000 people (Japanese figures say from 70,000 to 80,000) are killed.\\"away in April 2007.\\" If Vonnegut had been alive to compose that note, he would have added \\"so it goes.\\"<br /><br />End Note.

B008I43DYU|3.0|Its great to have a calculator when I need one and I always have my fire with me I have a calculator.
B00AGMTA62|2.0|I would have loved a DVD of the entire New Year's Day broadcast and not just simply a CD.  I have many recordings of Viennese music.
B003Y2BMVC|4.0|There are things I don't like about this futuristic retelling of &#34;Treasure Island&#34; -- I don't like that it promotes a message that teenage boys growing up in single mother households with absent father's rebel, won't find male role models in their lives, that they live dwelling on the resentment.  As my 23-year-old son says, &#34;Everyone promotes that you're supposed to have problems and feel that way.&#34;  On the other hand, my 12-year-old son adores the creativity that went into putting &#34;Treasure Island&#34; into the future... and if I dislike the other message, at least the hero is really a hero and in the end makes good in society,
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It's a delight to find a fascinating story immersed in Mother Nature. It was hard to put down.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|A flashback on a 60's Ray Charles album.  And really good music.  It is better than expected primarily because I didn't know what to expect.  It was good eniugh to send to a freind and they are enjoying it too.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Long time fan. Kids love it, and it helps them learn to spell.  Highly recommended. High quality.  Great play.  Solid stability.  Hours of fun.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I go this on a whim.  New Willie CD so I went for it.  Maybe his last?  Well it is dancable, it swings and it is great listening.  Really Good!  Get it
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun game but there is so much you have to pay for it really takes away from the fun at times. But fun for a while building up. Getting a touch boring though as not much to do past that
B000FC10HA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Some of the examples are dated, but in many cases these only served to support the claims of the author. If you are in sales, marketing or branding, I recommend this resource.
B008220D7S|1.0|The problem with this movie is it doesn't what it is trying to tell, it is just a confused story. Someone is @40 and is confused about the basic things in life.  It is not a great comedy nor it ends up being a good drama. The actors are ok but not much for them to do .  There are some funny moments but overall a very long movie(2:14hrs). Megan fox is completely waste , I wonder what makes her accept these kinds of roles. She was better in Jennifer's body (horrible movie) but still she had the lead role
B006LSZECO|3.0|I find the story seen it read it before. I couldn't really get into it and found it very slow. I still have not finished the book and it's been two weeks.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! It's SOO MUCH FUN, I have played for hours non-stop. Its very entertaining and really addictive. A must have game.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Some old news but some new twists, plus her personal story. Good read, especially for young women planning a career.
B002H0DX96|5.0|With coverage of the MN Twins games cancelled due to stormy spring weather, we decided instead to watch a baseball movie.  I watched this with family who grew up on a farm in Iowa.  We all agreed the movie accurately depicted our beautiful farmlands. Since watching this movie a week ago, we have watched the news coverage of the bombings in Boston.  In retrospect, I am happy to have the images of Boston and Fenway shown in this film still fresh in my mind.  If you are weary of the news coverage of the bombings, the perfect andidote is this film about the role Baseball has in our lives and in this country.  This film is not 'corny' even though it is set in Iowa.  Watch with your kids.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great show. Gritty and real. I was a BIG fan of HBO's The Wire and after i saw that I was hard pressed to find anything that came close to that show.... then i watched The Shield.
B009AMANH4|3.0|I expected the movie to be more about Lincoln's whole life, not just a few years.  I was disappointed to learn of the &#34;politics as usual&#34; deals going on 150 years ago.  The actors did a good job, however.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|The price of this movie was perfect. It was delivered quickly and the item was exactly as described. We had been looking to buy Grease for so long and I was thrilled to find it on amazon
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I was expected that the main characters would have been selected because they had outstanding vocal talent.  What a disappointment that was for me and the group I watched it with.  Reinforced my resolution to see a movie BEFORE I buy a DVD.
B007MOU6ZQ|4.0|Very glad that I read this on my kindle, I had to highlight so many parts, particularly in the last chapter.<br />Highly recommended if you are interested in mindfulness, stoicism and negative capability.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The movie was used but  was like new,the grandkids loved it. It arrived within just a few days. I would recommend  it to my friends.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|My favourite is A Farewell to Arms but this is worth your time for Hemingway's brilliant evocation of the atmosphere of youngish Americans in Paris in the middle of the nineteen twenties. And his description of fishing in the high mountain streams of the Basque country made me want to pull on my walking boats, grab a line and head for the hills and I'm a vegetarian... Hemingway doesn't need my endorsement but Amazon asked so here it is. I'm not even interested in bull fighting but I get the attraction (as detailed by Ernest) although feel sorry for the bulls.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|wonderful tv series i have no words to described it almost as good as dexter ha ha this is a tv series everybody should have,you will not regret!!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|That's a bummer it only gave me a day I thought they would give a week or at least 5 days but the graphics are really good so you should try it out.
0307588335|2.0|The level of analysis was lacking and showed a clear political bias rather than a depth of thought. I recommend &#34;Too Big to Fail&#34; by Sorkin for an account that cares more about chronicling the history than flogging a political agenda.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Every time I watch this movie it amazes me how well it was made and how scary it is. A classic forever!
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|Many good points, pointing to interesting research. I have discussed about it with friends and I recommend it as a read. I won't necessarily live by it, but there is a lot of food for thought.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I enjoyed this game when it originally came out years ago.  Nice to see that it is just like the original!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|My daughters loved Judy Garland in this movie and when they get together this is one that gets watched over and over - If you've never seen it you're in for a real treat!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Haley Williams is commited to self-reliance,  isn't angry anymore,  and not only accepts but embraces the real world in her latest victory.  The only weakness the album has in my opinion is that it is somewhat understated - I would love to hear her belt out the vocals the way she did in the song &#34;Decode&#34;.  There will be some who cannot accept the toned-down Paramore,  but the songs are still of very high quality;  I would describe Haley Williams as one of the best women songwriters of our time.  The punk feel has been replaced by alternating versions of pop and rock,  with some influences from other musical works - a gospel choir, ukuleles.  At times it is as soft as a Suzanne Vega album,  but not usually.  Songs I would rate lower than a B-:  none.  A+ song: &#34;Ain't It Fun&#34;.  Songs to consider downloading if you don't want to commit to the full album:  &#34;Fast In My Car&#34;, &#34;Grow Up&#34;, &#34;Daydreaming&#34;, &#34;Ain't it Fun&#34;, &#34;Part II&#34;, &#34;Still Into You&#34;, &#34;Anklebiters&#34;, &#34;Proof&#34;, and &#34;Hate to See Your Heart Break&#34;.  I would bet that most Paramore fans will embrace the new,  more mature version of the band.  But for those who can't, I understand - I was never able to accept the new Metallica either.  Stay in love with music!
B001CEE1YE|4.0|I've wanted these in Blu-ray for a while, but they were to costly. I get reward points on my Amer Xpress card that can be used on Amazon. When I get enuf points I get a new Blu-ray movie. (Got the 40th anniv. of Caberet for my wife also). I wish I had known that there are no menus on the discs. I'm deffer than a haddock, and always use CC. This is a real PITA for me, but I put on my Sennheiser wireless headphones, on surround sound, and it works OK for me. Now, my Samsung Blu-ray 5.1 player is only 2 years old, so it would seem that it should'nt need an update (even if I knew how to). So, is anyone else in this boat, or can you tell me how to get the menu up. All that comes up on the screen is \\"not available\\".<br /><br />Update: 5/27/13<br /> I found out that (being sci-fi people) the editors LOVE to screw w/you on the menu. I finally found out how to bring up the menu, so I can access the closed captioning and other features.I don't understand why these editors think it's so cool to make it a PITA to find, and work your way thru a menu !!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great jigsaw app. Lots of free puzzles to choose from.<br />Varying difficult settings. Hours of fun. Can't wait to see the next round of free puzzles
B008M721MS|5.0|I love this app can video chat with my friends ALL day, I recommend this app for all ages maybe, 6 or 7 need parent super vision.<br />How u enjoy it!!!
B0081336FO|5.0|Brilliant in every way. From the stories (close to originals), to the genius way they have be made modern day, to the directing choices, to the award-winning acting of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend and chosen by our book club.<br />The book draws you in and makes you think about many different things and the possibilities of  majic, illusion, forces of nature, the possibilities of these as powers, to be used.  What is real. It tests the imagination. I liked it. I feel this is a book you will like or hate, there doesn't seem to be a middle ground.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved the characters' stories weaving into each others and building throughout the years. The author takes you on a magical journey that includes love, rivalry, old battles, complex characters, knowledge, chance and fate.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Lots of cliches, many dropped story lines.  It was like watching a car wreck - we watched it even though it was horrible.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|This is a must own for a Treky - the original series is all it is cracked up to be and more.  Then get the rest of the series.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I really enjoyed book 2. I Like to read at night right before bed, so look for a book that is easy to follow.  It's not a masterpiece, but it's does a great job of being entertaining.  I look forward to book 3!
B000O78KW4|5.0|i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies. Bruce willis is very good in this movie. But so isnt everyone else. enjoyed it very much.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I will not be purchasing this product because it does not contain the 2D Blu Ray.  I do not yet have a 3D system as it is an expensive upgrade that I have been saving towards for the last 3 years.  In the meantime, I have been purchasing the 3D movies with the 2D Blu-Ray combo in anticipation of my upgrade.  With this new trend, I will not be upgrading my system, as I cannot afford the expense of purchasing 2 combos to get options.  Some movies viewed at home are better in 2D, others in 3D and one does not have the choice of which one works for you unless you pay double. That is very unfair to consumers who are already having difficulty in these tough economic times.
B001NU6GMC|4.0|good movie, lots of action and great to watch. would watch it again, and tell friends about it and to buy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game in the whole entire world.this game rocks!I can not stop playing it.I love this game! I love it more than temple run! And I love that game.but it is pretty much the same thing as temple run.the only thing is that you are in a subway!This game is awesome!  Love,Philip
034580404X|5.0|Loved the books.  If you like juicy stories it a definite must read.  So well protected so they will last forever
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I'm so happy I bought this stylus.  I had read a review about it that mentioned how it felt weighted like a pen & it's true!  I'm also happy that it has different point sizes - makes it very versatile.
B008GANNIC|5.0|So sad to see the original guitarist go, but they have transformed themselves into the POD of old. I loved all their original stuff. The most recent 2 releases before Murdered Love were very different and I don't believe these albums really enveloped POD. Murdered Love is hard and has their San Diego influences back on track. Would recommend to anyone!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this is a really fun game. great animation . it also teaches how to help in the world by saving animals from poachers and certain death. I really do love this game. its fun and is pretty cool.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I am a fan of BBC productions and this is an enjoyable series. The first episode, which is set in 1936, felt a bit slow to me, but after you are familiar with the characters it is almost impossible to stop watching. With Seasons 1 & 2 available with Prime I would recommend this to anyone that is waiting for Downton Abby to return...
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Our son loved it because it opened up all the levels not just one.  He said it is awesome.  Thanks.
B008476HBM|3.0|I haven't had a chance to read the entire book yet but it gets my interest after a chapter or two.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. Except I also hate it at times. So much intrigue and scandal, this is really a masterpiece.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|all you have to do to join the review group is put your title as the review group<br /><br />angry birds Rio (ad-free) summery<br /><br />*angry birds rooms load very slow<br /><br />*has over 250 levels<br /><br />*has power ups<br /><br />*has many birds<br /><br />* is epic<br /><br />*get the game
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I love this series. Very well written with enough complexity and meat that it is entertaining throughout. I highly recommend this if you are into fantasy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|all you have to do to join the review group is put your title as the review group<br /><br />everyone has played subway surfers. join them by logging in to facebook and breaking their scores use keys to revive and get a longer game. get special limited time characters. this is subway surfers
1449410243|5.0|This guy is hilarious. If you have a cat or have ever had one, you will love this book. Cats are so weird!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|all you have to do to join is put your title as the review group<br /><br />you can slice zombies and stuff like that in this game but I wanna be a zombie ( I'm only at wave 3 so shutup) lol
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is great for kids and adults.  Definitely one of my favorites.  And as a bonus it kept my niece and nephew occupied on a very long car trip!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very simple and easy to understand, I like that it gives me a line-graph log of its power levels and will state the condition of my battery (good, bad, etc.)
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I hat this app because it wouldn't talk it's horrible do not buy it and I played on my friends phone and it was hilarious and then I tried to play it on my kindle it sucks
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a very good game it is fun and hard at the same time. And I recommend it to everyone.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Dark in the title is certainly appropriate. Are CIA operatives really such crude cowboys as portrayed in this movie? Interesting -- but not a great movie.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It is to my understanding you wish for people to play your games ; which is good. but it is an flaw when you force them to pay for it.  to when what they down load is only three seconds long.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is my favorit game of this type!!! I have played it three times and each time was as entertaining &amp; challenging as the first. This game is a must have! No problems or glitches with the kindle fire version.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Had read something somewhere about it.at first i felt a little uncomfortable and weird watching this by myself..but after it was all said and done i look at this a whole lot different.I think it really portrays that we are all human and share the same basic need to love and be loved. &#34;NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION IS&#34;
0744014549|5.0|This book showcases all of the artwork of the new Tomb Raider game and is extremely nice to look at.  Good coffee table book or just to add to your artbook collection.  Don't want to spoil anything so I will say that this book features all the art unlocked if you win the game plus much much more.  It has all characters including villains as well as all the level artwork.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I cannot say it is a book I couldn't put down, because it has a very steady pace (sometimes slow). But the story is very interesting and it reveals the many secrets of what happens behind the scenes of a trial.
B00136Q4P0|5.0|38 songs of Michael Jackson's top songs! wow, can't beat that for this price. I'm very happy with this purchase.
1846551455|4.0|Nesbo is a really good writer.  I've read several of the Hole detective series and really enjoyed them.  They offer a different breed of main character and some very scary bad guys.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Wonderful book. Well written and the story kept me wanting more! The supernatural caster world is a very cool idea and makes me want to be a part of it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A well written science fiction story , with more real emotions and feelings than others I have read.In addition the author minimized violence.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This is the longest book ever they need to shorten the book a lot & the book has the most pages I ever seen a little to much pages I think if they shorten the book a lot that people would read it & use it as a resource for look up some stuff that they need & so that it won't take people a lot of time to read or look up stuff a long time to find what they need to & put letters when you have enter a new letter.<br /><br />P.S - Just Keeping It Real
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|If you like getting spooked watch all of these movies...kids liked it!! I would suggest starting with the first one.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|So I saw the trailer a while before the movie came out and thought...why would I want to see a movie that points out everything that I hate about my life? Then I talked to a couple of twenty-somethings that I like who loved it and I asked, \\"Why would you find humor about this part of life even relevant?\\" After all, they know nothing about mortgages,  or how incredibly stressful it is navigate the endless decisions of raising kids in the world today, loving them and wanting to escape and feeling guilty about that... \\" They simply answered that it was funny.<br /><br />Well, now I've seen it , and I have to say, I'm glad I did. It's not often you get humor that is this unpackaged. I didn't even find it painful, it was just honest, if a bit extreme. It was actually a relief to laugh at the stresses that plague all of us married-with-kids-full-time-working-parents (and who have complicated relationships with their own parents to boot!) It even managed to have a sweet center...Loved the John Lithgow subplot. You can't judge any of these imperfect folks by their covers.<br /><br />Well done, Judd Apatow.
1601251505|4.0|Immediately when I opened this book the paper on the spine of the book (at the base) ripped, so that was lame. I've never seen it on other books but it did happen to me so I'll mention it at least.<br /><br />Overall though it is a good book filled with lots of information and THE book you'll want to have if you are going to play Pathfinder.  I'm not a huge fan of the art but the art is secondary.  I'm not a huge fan of the text layout, which I feel is overly compressed, but definitely not a deal breaker.  If you liked D&D 3.5 but didn't like D&D 4e you'll probably like Pathfinder.  There are some common sense changes made, though there are a few (very minor) removals or rule changes that change certain spells or abilities.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I liked this movie a lot and will watch it again. It's fast paced with lots of action, has a great story line and it was quite enjoyable. The ending left plenty of room for a sequel so I'll be looking for that one of these days.
B000FC10IO|5.0|I prefer giving a few bullet points rather than an in depth review:<br />-Engaging female characters: one of those things that shouldn't be an issue in other stories (though sadly is), however Abhorsen definitely ignores that and has great characters all around,<br />-Read the others first: it isn't a book you could jump into without missing a lot of details (and enjoyable story), so go back to the start if you missed anything,<br />-Wide variety of elements, moods: you'll get sad, mysterious, uplifting, humorous, and a variety of other moods in the story.  You'll also get battles, magic, plotting, adventures, horror, and more,<br />-Unique takes on magic - it is nice to have different world with a different outlook on magic, with necromancy being the big element of the series,<br />Abhorsen makes a satisfying conclusion: this has a grander scale, more characters to enjoy and overall is a great finish to the story.
B008602KQI|4.0|I read all the books and have been looking forward to seeing this first movie. It couldn't possibly have everything in it from the books but it did lack a back story line. I felt there were two levels to this movie. The what we saw level (the movie itself) was more or less all the highlights of the book and the what we didn't see level (everything left out of the movie) was all the story line. I never thought Katniss was a likable character, she wasn't very nice and was pretty bit*&^y in all the books. The movie didn't portray that at all. I wasn't sure who all the characters were from District 1, guess the director didn't think it necessary to give them names. And Haymitch - in the first book he is a self-absorbed alcoholic with no time for anyone but himself.  In the movie he's not that at all, he's nicer, very helpful and a good guy. I liked the self-absorbed drunk much better.<br /><br />I am in hopes that the second movie will be more like the book. Now having said that, if you haven't read the books then you'll enjoy the movie for what it is. If you're like me and have read the books, this movie will be somewhat of a disappointment but worth watching.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|What is there to say? The song is amazing. Glad to see one of my favorite artists have FINALLY made some new music. (Not counting the Tron soundtrack.)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was really good, and is now one of my absolute favorite books. I will definitely read the other books and watch the movie when that comes out later this year.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|it was fun but story mode got impossiabl and gets boring but multiplayer is fun and it should be free
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I have had to redownload this game twice because I have purchased the game extension and it would not download unless I did so. I am extremely frustrated because I have now beaten the game twice and had to undownload it. I haven't even played the extension yet!! This is just stupid and they need to fix it! Great game just what the heck?!
B007HLIUN4|5.0|Read this to see what you should NOT do when you get into POWER.... Unless you want to destroy your nation
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's super fun but they should be cheaper the items in the game... it took me four months to buy one character... thank you
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|its great love gameloft keep it up wish you had more free games but takes to long to load needs more takes
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is zoo fun to play I like that you can chance the shark and that when you eat you get bigger.soo rate 5 star.
034580404X|3.0|There's a lesson to be learn that if you care and love a person you can make changes in your life.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|A great deal of misdirected violence, but good movie overall for the young adult. Entertaining, but not memorable. Just OK
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It has never worked - always says it has stopped working. Figure if it's not going to work - I'll just delete it.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Language was vulgar and humor fell flat with a lack of direction.  Couldn't decide which character I liked least, so many choices.
B006OISHGQ|1.0|I can't decide if that word was in there or not. I do know the vast majority of the words are common in a number of countries, not just Great Britain. I was hoping to find words of local coinage for writing, but it looks like I shall stick with listening to BBC..  This was not worth the investment.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Pink Floyd has been around for so long with so many fans, I was late getting into their music. Strict parents delayed some of my musical explorations as a youth. Thanks to my boyfriend of 10 years who introduced me to their music and in listening to it I found it to be so mystical and spiritual. Love, Love Love it.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|So glad FOB is back at it, this album is amazing! Even my SO who never liked them loves the whole thing!
B000001F29|5.0|State of independence... such a spiritual song.  Really like the 1st 2 songs and the rest are great. Vangelis has his own style mostly known for some of his songs used for movies in the 70's and 80's
B003B02O14|5.0|I always feel more clever when I read a Grisham book.  At the end however I'm reminded that there's always a smarter mind out there.....
B002ONC9NC|5.0|I loved it!  I highly recommend it.  I love the sets and the clothes, the storyline is great!  It should be required viewing for all who have teenaged girls!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Was trying to think of a perfect gift to give the throngs of new female high school & college graduates we are about to encounter over the next 6 weeks as well as their teachers/professors and this book is perfect!  Thank you for a plain spoken commentary on a complex issue.
B005T87QCI|1.0|When I bought something and it updated it deleted the thing I bought.Implausible stupid!!!!!!! Not a good buy. Rip off.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I rented this movie because our blu-ray is being serviced. I'm surprised we didn't just have to buy it with as many time as we watch it in one week
B0052OSTOS|4.0|Whole body scan lasts nearly 45 min. Her voice is soothing. She is non-judgemental and offers suggestions to overcome your inability to relax. This tape could benefit from some additional layers of sound such as gently crashing waves or soprano angels singing in the background. The body scan is thorough. There are shorter relaxation exercises to use during waking hours. I often fall asleep before the exercise is over.
0316077046|3.0|I don't know, but this teeny bopper book helped me fall asleep  but it's still ok if you like stories about super natural beings falling in love with witches and other freaks.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I am loving it, my son got me into this, i was playing Angry Birds Space and downloaded this one now im hook.  Soo much fun !!!
0785125965|4.0|This had a fantastic story, though it drags a bit at points. It's a more intelligent version of the hulk than I'm used to seeing, but I enjoyed it a great deal! It's fascinating to see Bruce Banner's friends fight against someone they really don't want to fight against - and the dichotomy of Bruce Banner and the Hulk are fascinating!
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I watched these on LIVE when they first came out and couldn't wait for the DVD. Great gift for any Halo fan; well written with good actors. My husband and I are hoping they choose to continue the series.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What makes Game of Thrones special is that despite being about a large number of characters that the show creators seem to be intent on making you loathe, they are so compelling and interesting that you still can't help but follow their stories!  I fabulous show I imagine will go down for the record books.<br /><br />If you're the least bit squeamish or turned off by graphic nudity or violence, you may want to steer clear - there are some quite uncomfortable scenes, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them trashy - the material is treated with an hearnest reverence that is scarce in this genre.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I was skeptical of this movie after it did so poorly at the theatre but now I wish I would have gone to see it. The 3D isn't one that has a lot of out of screen effects but has a lot of depth to it. The story is not bad so now that the price has dropped a bit I would recomend that you buy this movie you will be glad you did.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Nice app, but needs work. You have to both tap a button to set and then another button to save an alarm - not sure why this two-step process is necessary and can't be programmed as one step, but it's too many steps and can be confusing late at night when setting an alarm. There needs to be a volume override or a slider in the set alarm 'page' or a reminder if your volume is low or off, ptherwise you won't hear the alarm.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was my first time to view the movie.  I have since learned that this movie has been<br />made over many times.  I now have the version made in 1935. I will view to see the difference other than color.  I am sure there will be many.
B00BJS7LHC|2.0|If you're looking for a good revenge movie in the Tarantino style, check out Death Proof.  Django didn't feel Tarantino at all :(
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I haven't found the time to read it yet, but I love the series so i'm sure I'll enjoy it.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|It's good. Though has a lot of movement and loud sudden noises. So watch if you don't mind that stuff
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game. Fast paced. Check twice a day to level up more quickly. Reminds me of other virtual city games.
B003YNFYCO|4.0|Not their best, but passable. I'll listen again, before I'm able to justify my criticism.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Anthony G. Small
B002PEP4C8|4.0|The book held my interest, especially since it was true.<br />She is a brave woman who did not let this horrific happening stop her from seeking justice.
B000N3ST7A|3.0|this Okay, but I'm a huge fan of the origenal recordings, this live stuff is so-so would have rather had all the songs as studio versions! but all in all Stevie is AWEOME!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I think this is the best album these guys have ever put out. The riffs rock, the vocals are well done, and both discs just flow from song to song.
B0019TYQ38|4.0|THe BBC version in 6 episodes is significantly better and, overall, more accurate (though I don't like that they cut out the youngest Miss Dashwood). But, in this E. Thompson, H. Grant one, it is not clear why Marianne Dashwood ends up with the Colonel.  The reason this one is a better version is that, although the series S&S is wonderful, the Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant version has better looking more warm characters.  Additionally, I can't open the BBC version no matter how many times I try, therefore, I am forced to watch this when I want to &#34;read&#34; (okay watch) a J. Austen film.
0385349831|5.0|This is not a book to be read quickly.  Each chapter needs to be savored.  Each chapter is like a short film where everything has meaning you don't want to miss.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Best version ever! Actually caused me to enjoy the novel, which heretofore I will no longer refer to as a tale of a silly little girl and her dirty old man lover.  Well performed, the deviations are in keeping with the novel andthis is the authority on J. Austen's Emma. Romola Garai is a gem in this role.
6305428352|4.0|A movie worth watching again and again.  It reminds me of It's A Wonderful Life.  I would just like to realize my wonderful life sooner than later!
B007SSEZNA|4.0|I love the romantic aspect of this film.  What is on Frank Churchill's head (worst wig ever).  The lines in this version are actually better than the BBC version with Romola Garand(sp),(more pointedly taken rom the book)  but the thoroughness of craft-attention to the depth of the novel- is, of course lacking, in the Paltrow version.  There is a good deal of humor and use of cinematography to work the humor in this Paltrow version and though Mr. Knightley is apparently shorter (at least he appears that way in the profession of love seen) he is very pleasant to look upon.<br /><br />If you are an Austen fan, watch the other one instead (Romola Garand).  If you really just enjoy a period piece, this will do.
1596912863|3.0|I didn't really like the main character.  I didn't dislike her, either.  I didn't really like or dislike any of the characters.  They were all just \\"there\\".  Cute (though contrived) book, easy read.  If you love all things Austen, you'll enjoy it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is the one app I use every morning when I get up. new layout is an improvement on the earlier version. highly recommend for the kindle fire.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This story is so \\"elabrate\\" so... so.... \\"undescribable\\"! I understood alot in this movie it was dramatic sad funny and some parts made me cry.....
B0030IIZ56|5.0|One of the very best!!!! Pixar, along with its parent Disney, is one of the prime examples of moviemaking history. Highly recommended!!!
B004EF6632|5.0|You know that movie that you go back and watch every time you have one of those days? This is that movie for me. Granted, it's 4 episodes and they add up to about 3.5 hours. But it's totally worth it! And it's got Richard Armitage aka Thorin Oakenshield from The Hobbit! How can you go wrong? Give it the first 15-20 minutes and you'll be hooked. If you are a fan of Larkrise to Candleford, Downton Abbey and similar period pieces, you'll love it.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|One of the very best!!!! Pixar, along with its parent Disney, is one of the prime examples of moviemaking history. Highly recommended!!!
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Was fortunate enough to see the Hollywood premiere (won tickets on KROQ!) of this movie with Dave Grohl and a ton of other musicians from the documentary.  Dave Grohl directed this movie and it was an amazing movie/documentary.  Sound City was a historic place and it was amazing to learn how many legendary bands recorded an album(s) there.  The Blu-Ray is worth every penny- even if you are a casual music fan, you will not be disappointed. HIGHLY recommended!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|One of the very best!!!! Pixar, along with its parent Disney, is one of the prime examples of moviemaking history. Highly recommended!!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|An interesting book by a doctor who almost dies, but returns to tell us about his hallucinations while in a coma fighting for his life. Books like this seem to find an eager public searching for meaning and hoping there is more than to life than a brief journey here on earth. But the author didn't convince me.<br />On another level it is a nice story about family, hope, fortitude and ultimate recovery. It is also an interesting medical and scientific account of Illness and the health-care system.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I absolutely love the movie, the production and casting was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only negative is the amount of movie advertising prior to the start
0972169504|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone who is a STEM major or a grad student! It is is truly funny!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like all the Dragons on Dragonvale. You get a lot of money. I have 6,678,967 from the Dragons. There aren't any viruses on Dragonvale. It is fun.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Overrated big time. The plot was unthingable and still moved like a turtle. Would not recommend it for rental to anyone
B008VBYN80|1.0|This app seems well written and fun to play around with, but it is my belief it exist only as a vehicle to facilitate in app purchasing.<br /><br />Without oversight, we make Android policy with our every purchase.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I hate watching the news and was looking for a weather app that was easy to use and would let me save locations I am interested in.  This is easy to use and fits the bill perfectly.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|For medical reasons, I need to semi-wake every 2 hours at night (long story). Up till now, I have not been able to find an acceptable app to accomplish this seemingly simple task. I've been manually setting my old kitchen timer, with 4 individual countdown timers, every night (each countdown has to be set separately).<br /><br />Timers4Me works perfectly for this need! I can start it manually or have it start itself at midnight in case I fall asleep early.<br /><br />The footprint is relatively small (less than 4 MB), so I can leave it running constantly on my limited system.
B000002UB2|5.0|This was a gift for my dad, and shipped to my dad in South Africa. I've not had the chance to see this product first hand, but from what he says, it's great! He loves it and the quality is good, so thank you Amazon!
B003AWRMCE|5.0|great movie .was as good as when i watched it years ago ,great acting .i would recommend it to  all Eastwood ,freeman hackman fans
B007MB5OCE|4.0|It took awhile to get into the flow of the story. It introduces so many characters,and the writer has a quirky style, but it is well worth the effort. It takes you on this incredible trip thru time an countries and has many laugh out loud moments. Once I got into the groove of the storytellers style, I couldn't put it down.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|a really good movie ,statham  plays a great role as do the rest of the cast .the story is better than average do to the fact that it is based on a real happening. almost makes ya want to be there , many turns in the plot makes it even better.
0142403873|5.0|my three year old loves the movie and also the other one that fits with it there's the gruffalo and also the gruffalos child with both the books too and we now own all four of those items and he watched this over and over and wants to read the book almost every night before bed lol.
0374275637|4.0|There is much of interest for the average reader in this book- though I confess upfront that I had to reread the statistics and that even then, some of the wordage went by me- but that did not stop me from being fascinated by the information, especially how we make decisions, how we take risks- or not- and on how the way information is presented can make such a difference to how we make choices. I would like to see the author expand on how the research affects other parts of our lives- other than being aware of our decision making propensities. This book has far wider ramifications, especially for negotiations when one understands the loss and gain value associated with compromise.
B001HN69AY|5.0|This is a great movie. The twenty-something age group really loves it. It could be a collectible over time. Awesome.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I loves their songs I've heard on the radio and mostly wanted the album for \\"Radioactive\\", but I was pleasantly surprised by the rest of the songs. All great stuff with a variety of moods and themes. Definitely recommend it!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This movie more than met the hype. It was an excellent look into the workings of government - which apparently haven't changed much - and the mind of a great man.
B0090CMMIC|5.0|Just picked up this album a couple days ago along with a pair of others; they are still waiting to be listened to, owing exclusively to how outstanding this one is.  Bones is a great single; ironically enough I had never heard it on the local rock radio station until after I bought it.  The opening track is outstanding and really gives the listener a taste of the range there guys have melodically.  While it's not startlingly \\"new\\" or groundbreaking stuff, it's particularly well put together and that's what really matters.  Fans of Tremonti, newer 30 Seconds to Mars or older Anberlin will enjoy.<br />Sidebar: Hymn For All I've Lost is probably one of, if not THE best \\"interlude\\" style songs of the past decade.  It's as long as it needs to be and is absolutely haunting.  As a lead-in to You Are Not it's flawless.  Well done guys.  Now I have to get your first album too...
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|This game has very little instruction.  Hard to make it work.  Frustrating!  But you keep trying to be successful but keep failing!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I have used the free version of this for a really long time, has always been exactly what I needed for a countdown timer, and never acted wonky.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. I love every bit of it. Suzanne Collins is the best author ever! It is truly amazing
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Fun and fast download. I like to play it on my phone during down time. I like it better than Space but less than the original.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is another favorite of mine by Rick Riordan! This is a great book to read!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is great, you won't want to stop reading it! Gone Girl keeps you guessing right up until the very end.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|Regency meets vampire but with a bit of a twist.  The characters are well developed and the story moves at a good pace. A strong female lead makes this an enjoyable read. Very much looking forward to next installment.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Loved this action thriller.  Good show of talent and choice of actors. This is a plausable story line to watch.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable movie adaptation of one of the greatest shows ever to grace the world's theaters. Should have received Best Picture Oscar.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This series is the first if its kind to gain such popularity. I definitely feel that it had a few areas that could have been better, but the overall love story is enchanting and unique and made me want to keep reading.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this exquisite performance that contains the beautiful music of this wonderful show. True beauty with performance by past stars and more current cast members.
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|Great games but with the controls on a tablet, not so much. The price is great , and not their fault about controls. Just not my favorite.

B004NELBPC|1.0|The recent redesign is not an improvement for the most basic purpose of a news app:  reading.  The font is tiny and can't be enlarged by a setting or by zooming.  Also the app no longer rotates.  (on Kindle Fire original model)

Also it's slightly difficult to remove batteries' lid (better to use a flat screwdriver, or spoon, or something similar).<br />Surprisingly, when I disassembled the lamp - inside it's built very well, really.<br />So, who cares about cheap plastic if the lamp works perfectly? I don't, so, 5 stars :)
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a great game but not good when you cant see other player scores.its pretty boring when theres no competition

B004DK5CW4|5.0|Normally I wouldn't watch a horse racing movie, but this one was a TRUE story, so it was worth the viewing and I am glad I did watch it, I liked it so much I bought it. And when I look at Secretariat he looked so much like my horse does, although I don't race my horse I ride hunter/jumper.<br />Even if you aren't a horse lover, this movie will make you into one. I recommend it to the world.<br />Diane Lane plays the part of Penny Tweedy and does an excellent job, which you can't expect any less from her.

B00632HWOG|3.0|The ability of using it is just ok.  If I really want to read and answer it I have my computer for doing so.  The Kindle Flame is ok for what it is, but I am just beginning to figure out exactly what it is.  At I later date, if I keep it, it may prove more worthwhile.
0812993845|2.0|Let me begin by saying that I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's novels, and that I frequently turn to them for fun and stress-relieving reads.  I've come to count on Kinsella's likeable, but often misguided protagonists and have come to expect the slapstick and often ridiculous choices that her characters make.  In the Shopaholic series, for example, it's comically painful to read about Becky's exploits at times.  But this one?  I hate to say it, but this book is just really painful to read.  Here's the premise:  Lottie is notorious for making poor post-breakup choices.  Fliss, her divorced sister, often has to pick up the pieces.  So when Lottie announces a surprise wedding, Fliss takes it upon herself to derail the marriage.  Since she can't stop the wedding, she must stop the wedding NIGHT.  So you get the idea.  Page after page is dedicated to her schemes, and after a while, it's just annoying.  The characters are not developed, and the story just sort of flounders.  It would have been funny had this been a -part- of the story and not the entire story.  Color me disappointed.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|The movie has a great solid story, the acting is topnotch. Tom Cruise is a good actor theres no doubt about it. He may be crazy in real life but he is a great actor. Great movie, you'll love it , His Martial Arts is real and awesome. Love it!
B000002AGM|5.0|...and given how good Sketches of Spain is, that's saying a lot. In fact, Davis+Evans in orchestral jazz is like Lennon and McCartney in pop music; you know it's going to be great.<br /><br />This isn't Miles best selling album, or necessarily one of his most widely known. But if you talk to jazz afficianados, every one knows Miles Ahead, and not just because the title track is one of his best known songs. Rather, they'll tell you this album is chock full of gems waiting to be discovered. It starts with the sublime Sprinsville and just keeps rolling.<br /><br />Davis was a constantly evolving muscian throughout his career. Many people my age know him better through his electric period with future greats like Corea, McLaughlin, Williams, Shorter, et alia. They'd be well rewarded to go back to a time when a subtler Davis could make your spine tingle with just the right passage at the right time.<br /><br />As an aside, the original cover art and expanded linear notes and photos of the recording session are a real plus.<br /><br />This is a Top 50 Must Own Jazz Album!
B009X01C64|5.0|This stand is absolutely the perfect product in my opinion. Marware hit a home run with this one. Put it on your list when you purchase your Kindle.
B001CVCB9O|5.0|...although the recent Algeirs is also very good.<br /><br />Calexico is the kind of band where the arrangements and production are at their peak. The final result, pleasing as it is, comes not from one long guitar riff or one vocal stanza, but rather how the instruments and the vocals are perfectly matched. I have to think of an album like Sgt. Pepper's to recall another pop album this well produced and arranged.<br /><br />Of course, Calexico's music is far away from The Beatles, but that doesn't diminish the joy to be had from even a first listening. The Spanish horns are especially well arranged. The tracks Insperacion and House of Valparaiso are the standouts, but the whole album is better than 95% of today's pop music.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I related to this book because as a young woman, I too took to the mountain trails backpacking and camping by myself though on a much smaller scale.
0345803507|3.0|Very sexy but could have been better written. I'm glad that in this book the main characters became more human and fleshed out
B000FBJFSC|1.0|I didn't like the book at all and don't understand the hype about it one bit.  Just goes to show how powerful Oprah is.<br /><br />I don't mind a historical, telling book but the style in which this is written really sucks.<br /><br />Also, the kindle version was horrible.  Every page had a different font.  Several pages began with three or four sentences of the previous page.  It was horrible and I might have been able to overlook this major problem had the book been decent to begin with.  I have never had this problem with Amazon's books before, or since, so I know it's not my Kindle.<br /><br />Really, do NOT waste your money, even if it is only $2.99.  I would rather have given this to a homeless person, at least I know he would have enjoyed smoking crack with my money rather than throwing my money at this awful excuse for a book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have to give props to Steve Jobs for allowing the author show Jobs how he really was and not write some glossed over bio. Very driven, Jobs oftentimes neglected his human side
0439023491|3.0|Even after her unlikely victory in the Hunger Games, Katniss is not safe: there are rumors of an uprising, and as she makes her Victory Tour through the Districts she must try to quell a rebellion she accidentally started and may not want to stop. Collins writes without skill: Katniss's narration is bland and voiceless, despite the intensity of her personality and emotions. The plot reiterates, in both pacing and content, The Hunger Games--a lazy reliance on convention that fails to further Katniss's changing world. And, again, there are dei ex machina; while not out of place in the setting, these create inconsistent characterization but more often make Katniss seem two steps behind everyone, including the reader, in predicting the next twist.<br /><br />In the end, none of this detracts from the book. It wants to be more--better written, bolder, more vivid--but remains utterly absorbing. Despite its simplicity and contrivances, difficulty gives it undeniable momentum: Katniss's violent emotions, the danger of her situation, the consequences of the building rebellion. Flawed people fighting an uncertain, high-stakes battle has just enough weight to be rewarding as well as addicting. In other words, this is what one would expect successful YA literature to be: artless but effective. I'll finish up the trilogy, and recommend it and this installment moderately.
0345803493|3.0|The characters are just begining to be fleshed out in this one. could have been better written. What do you expect from something that started out as twlight fan fiction?
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Loved this movie. Romance and comedy come together to make this an excellent must see. It's like a present day musical.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Sam Rockwell stars in a virtual one-man show as Sam Bell, the lone employee at a lunar mining operation just shy of the far side of the Moon. From this location the Earth hangs permanently in the sky just barely above the Lunar horizon. He is not on the dark side of the moon, since there is no such place. The Moon has day and night like Earth, except Moon's full day-night cycle is a month long rather than 24 hours. Like a rocket launch to a distant star, the story starts out slowly, accelerating constantly until toward the end you wonder how they are going to be able to wrap it up in the time remaining. It is an intriguing character study despite its limited cast, with great acting performances. Moon has some echoes of Soylent Green, featuring a corporation that has devised an innovative way of managing personnel; of 2001 Space Odyssey, with an enigmatic robot co-worker; of Total Recall, with memories called into question; and Monsters Inc., with \\"scream cans\\" of energy.<br /><br />The Blu-ray offers great clarity of fine details like the lunar dust and rocks flying from the mining machinery, very believable moonscapes, intricate interiors of vehicles and the lunar base, and realistic physical decline of the astronaut/miner. Audio is understated but very effective, with a minimalist musical score that suits the claustrophobic environment.<br /><br />How unrealistic, I initially thought, that this massive industrial operation on the Moon would have only one employee. But that's the lynchpin of Lunar Industries' brilliant staffing plan. Sam Bell is at the end of his three-year contract, and will be returning to Earth in two weeks. The storyline is simple but intense, and to tell more would lessen the finely tuned suspense. Well worth an evening's viewing. In fact, I watched it two nights in a row.

B009CVAUIU|1.0|I read this because I read all Pulitzer fiction winners.  Otherwise I would never have finished this moronic and boring book.  I was bored spitless and it never got more interesting as I read on and on.  Once in awhile I laughed at some thing put in the mouth of the Norh Korean leader but the story kept jumping around and never made any logical sense--and did  not even end as it should have.  The identity of the main character was changeable and sometimes he was called one thing and sometimes another. I have read some really unintersting and boring Pulitzer prize-winning fiction but this has to be the very worst I have ever read.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I actually bought this album months ago on iTunes bc regrettably it was not available on Amazon, so I am so very glad it is finally here.<br /><br />I don't often review music, but I love this entire album so much I thought I'd give it a go. I kind of have music ADD and have a hard time listening to an entire album all the way through, but this one I had listened to it twice all the way through before I realized it. You never miss the fact that there are no words in the music. It is all a light dub-step techno base, with Lindsey playing the violin over it. It's kind of hard to really get a feel for it without actually hearing it. There is something about this music that both energizes as well relaxes at the same time. The violin has the calming influence of classical, but the techno base gets your blood moving.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see Ms. Stirling in concert a couple of weeks ago and she is a fun energetic entertainer. Her music live is just as good as it is on the album! I highly recommend Ms. Stirling to everyone no matter your typical music tastes.

After i hung up the phone from the amazon customer service tech it began to happen. I would close out the app yet the video continued to play.

Then i went back into the app and the video was stuck in the middle and i could NOT close it out!! so frustrating and such unprofessional garbage... user beware.. download and use at your own risk
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Typical Clancy style with multiple plot lines and all the action wrapping up in the last 50 pages. Overall well written, although I would say character development for this book not what some of the earlier books were. Overall, if you like Clancy this is another good page turner.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is the best so far but I think we can work it out and get used to it.my mom likes this game and so do my brothers.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I enjoyed the star wars of angry birds but this is by far my favorite.  The scenes themselves are enjoyable and there are degrees of easy to more difficult.  Having the birds that fly and the fish that swim is very creative.  However, it is the monkeys that are my favorite.  I get the biggest kick out of them when they get knocked over and if they seem to slip when hit, they sometimes scrabble their little legs and sometimes they get to stand up instead of falling.  If you haven't purchased any other angry birds do purchase this one, you will not regret it.  I hope they continue to do more like this.  What fun!  On the negative side, I have become addictive to Rio that I get very little other projects done.  Enjoy!
B0046YK43E|5.0|This 1953 Bayreuth Ring Cycle, conducted by Clemens Krauss only months before his untimely death, has been issued many times over on various CD labels (and LP predecessors), with each one claiming to have superior sound over previous versions.  In this case the hype is correct, as the Orfeo label -- always a first-class act that never takes any shortcuts -- is the first one to have direct access to the original master tapes.  Previous versions all had very fine monaural sound, but this is truly a step ahead of them all.<br /><br />So much has been written about this magnificent Ring by many leading critics that it would be superfluous for me to recover the ground they have already trod.  In brief, this is regarded by many as the greatest Ring cycle ever recorded.  While it of course cannot match the justly fabled Solti Ring for Decca in terms of sonic firepower, it trumps it by virtue of superior singing.  Here, Hans Hotter sings all three Wotan roles rather than only the latter two, and does so while still in prime voice instead of the severely decayed, wobbly shadow of his best captured by Decca.  Wolfgang Windgassen as Siegfried is likewise a decade fresher in voice (though here, as in virtually every one of his surviving live performances, he screws up a stanza of \\"Nothung! Nothung!\\" in Siegfried -- in this case, he enters a measure late and doesn't get on track until his first rendition  of \\"Ho! Hei!\\")  Astrid Varnay is a powerful Bruennhilde, more womanly than Birgit Nilsson but less beautiful in timbre than Kirsten Flagstad; she already ha her trademark tendency of scooping into pitches from beneath them, though it is not as pronounced as it would be in just a few years.  Ramon Vinay is a saturnine, anguished Siegmund with a powerful, darkly baritonal voice.  Regina Resnik, here still a soprano briefly before changing registers to the mezzo-soprano range, is a superb Sieglinde, and also the Third Norn in Goetterdaemmerung.  Paul Kuen remains the best Mime of the second half of the 20th century; he not only characterizes brilliantly, he also actually sings rather than barks his role.  Gustav Neidlinger once again delivers his nonpareil Alberich.  Rita Streich is likewise the best Woodbird ever caught on recordings.  The now little-known Maria von Ilosvay is a magnificent Erda and First Norn in Goetterdaemmerung; Hermann Uhde likewise excels as Donner and Guenther.  Waltraute, the Second Norn in Goetterdaemmerung, and both Frickas, receive solid if not exceptional delivery from Bayreuth mainstay Ira Malaniuk.  Josef Greindl is as always a menacing if cavernous-voiced Fafner, Hunding, and Hagen; the great Ludwig Weber is a stellar Fasolt.  Gerhard Stolze is a much better Froh here than the barking Mime he would be for Solti.  The relative weak links in the cast -- and even those are tolerable rather than poor -- are Erik Witte as a Loge with somewhat uncertain pitch,and Bruni Falcon and Natalie Hinsch-Groendahl are likewise intonationally challenged as Freia and Gutrune, respectively.  The three Rheinmaidens (Gisela Litz, Hetty Pluemacher, and Erik Zimmermann) and the Walkuere sisters (Falcon, Litz, von Ilsovay, Bruennhild Friedland, Sybilla Plate, Erika Schubert, Lise Sorrell, and Lisalotte Thomamueller) in general fulfill their roles capably.  Orfeo provides a 134-page trilingual book (German/English/French) with copious technical details, extensive essays, and numerous photos.<br /><br />So, don't stint by buying an inferior version -- the Rolls Royce edition on Orfeo is the way to go.  I only have one caveat, of a sort.  Andromeda has issued the other 1953 Bayreuth Ring, almost the same as this one but with two major cast changes: Josef Keilberth instead of Clemens Krauss is the conductor, and Martha Moedl instead of Astrid Varnay is the Bruennhilde.  The conducting varies little between the two runs, but the choice of Bruennhilde may be very important to you.  I greatly prefer Moedl to Varnay; it is here, rather thanin the 1953 RAI Ring under Furtwaengler, where the dessicated surviving third-generation primary sources do a considerable disservice to the timbre of her voice, that one really hears what a splendid Bruennhilde Moedl was.  If I had to live with only one Ring cycle, it would be that one for her sake.  But it lacks the royal treatment given to this far better known version, and I am most grateful to have them both.in the 1953 RAI Ring under Furtwaengler, where the dessicated surviving third-generation primary sources do a considerable disservice to the timbre of her voice, that one really hears what a splendid Bruennhilde Moedl was.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app.  Cannot express that enough.  This is my favorite way to view pinterest.  I love how you scroll through pictures, but just one at a time so you're not having to scan through several pictures at once.  I really like the ability to like or repin pictures without having to open each picture up and also because you don't have to lose your spot in the previous search page like the traditional website.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A real classic with everyone doing an amazing job of singing (yes, even Russell Crowe!!!! His voice is perfect for the creepy police inspector)...

B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|One of all time best American classics, a great book for young and old alike.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Kate Morton is a master.  Although I liked The Forgotten Garden and The Secret Keeper better than The House at Riverton, I really enjoyed this book as well.  Not only was the plot an interesting one, but by the end of the book I felt as if I really knew each of the characters. It is not a &#34;quick read&#34;,  so plan to devote time to reading and enjoying  it.  I am eager to read anything by Kate Morton and would recommend her to anyone who enjoys a plot with plenty of twists and surprises.
630469878X|5.0|It is a very good movie. The ending is my favorite part, when they grab hands before they drove off the cliff. Like the music as well.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Really addictive game. Highly recommended. I would rather play then tickle my nuts. I play ping pong with my ding ding.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I could simply not put this book down!  I've never read a book so quickly, ever!  I was pulled in the first few pages and remained entranced!  I obviously loved it.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|The movie was very good and also the acting.  It really lets you know what this family went through to find each other and is a true story.  Very sad but good ending.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! Its so much fun!  I could play it for hours. The other awesome thing is that its free!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is one of the best writers of this century.  His Pillars of the Earth is one of my all-time favorites, as is the 2nd book of this trilogy, Winter of the World\\".  He writes with such passion that he draws you into each character and you hate to put the book down.  Who cares that it's 900 pages!  It's so-o-o worth the read!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|My very dear friend recommended this book.  I just finished it and am just so happy I took the time to read it. Very positive and encouraging. A must read for anyone who has experienced cancer in their lives.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Super game, help grand kids with spelling and  make then happy that they are learning new works and the pictures help. Fun and more fun.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I am a Timothy Ferriss fan, I think he epitomises how to operate in the new information age and this book has sparked my interest in cooking,
B0055S348W|5.0|Printer Share is the only wi-fi direct and bluetooth print program I have found that really works.  There are several that send stuff to cloud but I wanted direct print from my Android tablet, and printer share does that very well. You don't have to be an  A+ certified computer tech to use it.  Most of all it works.  I have a Toshiba Thrive tablet and ocassionaly it gets quirky. The Tech Support team at Printer Share were great.  Their responses were timely and they understood and fixed my problems very quickly. I would recommend this program highly.<br />Jud
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Recommended. Game of thrones was slightly better. A must for fans and new to the series alike. You'll get invested in the characters and begin yo feel for them.

B00006LLJ4|5.0|Three psychics can predict who will commit crimes in the future. The \\"PreCrime\\" department of police acts on these reports to prevent crimes from occurring. The person accused by the psychics -- \\"precogs\\" -- is jailed without a trial or legal defense.<br /><br />The PreCrime force is being audited, before this experimental branch of police is launched nationwide. The head of PreCrime's name appears as guilty of a murder that has yet to occur. No one has ever escaped the PreCrime's justice, but John is going to try; he doesn't see how it is possible that he could ever commit a murder.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />* Action sequences<br />* Complex plot<br />* Futuristic technology and use of psychic powers<br />* A who-done-it determinism vs. free will thriller<br /><br />Stars: Tom Cruise (\\"Mission: Impossible\\") and Colin Ferrell (\\"Total Recall\\")<br /><br />Year: 2002<br /><br />Inspiration: 1956 short story \\"The Minority Report\\" by Philip K. Dick<br /><br />This movie is a lengthy two-popcorn-bucket bonanza at almost three hours long. We've always read that knowing the future can change the \\"now,\\" and this movie expresses that premise in an easily understandable action format. For people who do have some belief in psychics, this film explores the possibilities of what it is that psychics \\"really\\" see.<br /><br />Read Philip K.

1416955070|5.0|I love this series!  I am addicted and can't put these books down.  I liken it to the Twilight series but it's so different also.  I'm reading them so quickly because they are so good.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|After the Dark Ages, \\"someone\\" decided that humans don't need to have free will, that it is too dangerous. Then came the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and. Humans did so well, that we were given free will back. Enter WWI, WWII, and the Cold War. Good-bye free will again.<br /><br />With this premise in mind, the movie opens with David Norris losing the election for United States Senate. He goes into the mens bathroom to rehearse his concession speech. Elise is in the mens bathroom hiding from security. She makes David laugh and inspires him at a crutial moment in his life. They were \\"fated\\" to meet. But, they are never \\"supposed to\\" meet again.<br /><br />Later, David is on his way to a new job. The \\"free will police\\" are \\"supposed to\\" make him spill his coffee by 7:05 AM, so that David will miss the bus and therefor also miss seeing Elise. They fail. David is to discover that the people who determine \\"fate\\" are a powerful group, don't enjoy being thwarted, and have ways of making you comply with the Chairman's \\"plan.\\" David and Elise will use coincidences, guile, and devotion to fight against predestination in this Harry-Potter-meets-Big-Brother film, modeled on the Philip K. Dick short story, \\"Adjustment Team.\\" The ending is not what you'll expect.<br /><br />Stars: Matt Damon from \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and Emily Blunt from \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\"<br /><br />Genre: Action, Romance, Science Fiction<br /><br />Year: 2011<br /><br />Inspiration: 1954 short story by Philip K. Dick titled \\"Adjustment Team\\"<br /><br />This movie has a slow build-up to the major plot line. The first ten minutes introduce the characters, but do nothing to explain the predestination and fate complexities that later plague David and Elise. Based on those first ten minutes, a viewer would believe the movie is a political romance, and that is not close whatsoever. Pay attention throughout to catch the subtleties of the plot; once those first ten minutes have passed, the movie is packed with scenes that you don't need to miss in order to keep track of the rules of how the Adjustment Bureau (\\"Free will police\\") work.<br /><br />I have recommended this movie to family and friends many times. Reactions have ranged from \\"WOW!\\" to \\"thought-provoking,\\" but all have been positive. Each time I have a chance to watch this film with someone, I do. Again and again, the movie reveals something new to me through the eyes of another person. I still recall the first time. The last half hour was full of unexpected craziness, and the conclusion wass nothing I would have predicted.<br /><br />The religious undertones have various interpretations. A person can watch the movie simply for fun, or one can scan the dialog and inferences for hidden meaning.

B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|Always liked this endearing film.  Woody & Diane click as usual.  The dream sequences about Bogart & Casablanca make this movie as good as it is.  I may even like it more than \\"Annie Hall\\" & that's saying a lot.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fantastic game it is really fun if u like Mario. I think many different people would like this game.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed this book..I had heard a bit of this American history but didn't know it had been this extensive . I only had heard that many of the children were juvenile delinquents  It was an experience that makes you appreaciate the human spirit.It left me breathless and tearful for these children's experiences .The love of strangers that gave many of these children a positive outcome.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son loves minecraft and this lego set grabbed his attention. He takes his stories from his minecraft world and incorporates them into his legos. Its a bit small and I wish there were more sets but its a great addition to his collection.
B008XJM86Y|5.0|Awesome music I heard Kennedy on Guitar Center on TV with Slash thought he had an awesome voice and it is all excellent music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an awesome book. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the Harry Potter series or any books by Rick Riordan. I have read both and enjoyed this book.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is an awesome game, and what's better is it's free! The only downside I think is that everytime you run out of time you have to start over instead of continuing from where you are at the time. Works great on Kindle Fire and graphics are good
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great song! Daft Punk is back to their roots with this new single.  It has that electronic, smooth-jazz sound.  Perfect chill song.  Hopefully the rest of the album contains more of their signature techno sound!<br /><br />Oh, and I liked how this was released on Amazon before iTunes.  Good to know Amazon gets stuff before!
1878424505|5.0|This book, combined with discipline, meditation, and thought, will change your life. I purchased this book a few years ago during a very spiritual time of my life, as it went along with and reaffirmed most of the wisdom I had gained. Not it serves me as a reminder and as a teaching tool to share with others.<br /><br />This is the last of the legitimate Castaneda teachings, the next books are not his true work.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I'm a big movie fan, owning hundreds of movies, but didn't get a chance to see this in a theater so I bought the DVD on the many raves I'd heard. When I started watching it, though, I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes or so - it was just awful. There were no characters introduced that I cared about in the least (are we supposed to like Valjean?), the production design seemed over-the-top to me bordering on sci-fi, and even the music was not at all compelling, sounding like a parody of a Broadway musical. I realize that the movie may have gotten better (though I doubt it when it comes to the music) but I couldn't take any more of what I was watching so it didn't matter. I really wish I could get my money back for this one.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Enjoyed the process the story line took me through to get to the completion of  Gibb's anger at an American killing our own.
B0083V2W6I|3.0|I got this DVD so I could finally see this movie which I've somehow missed all these years. I ended up being disappointed for a couple of reasons. First, I was hoping for a lot more music by The Who. What was included was great but the rest of the music, while good, did not have the same impact. The second disappointment was the main character. While I could understand the story of a troubled teen, I had difficulty in finding anything in this character to like, and as he made bad decision after bad decision I found no reason to care about his problems since he was bringing them all upon himself.<br /><br />I did very much like the Criterion treatment of this film. When you put in the disk, it goes directly to the menu with no delays (like previews, animation, and all that garbage). The picture and sound were excellent, especially the 5.1 audio which is far improved over the original 2.0 (also included). I haven't yet listened to the commentary or watched all the extras on the second disk but I'm impressed by what's there and will be watching these soon.
B000FC1HQY|4.0|Loved this book!  Some familiar places I have visited, and plan to soon visit!  I could clearly see, smell and hear this story from the author's writing.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm late to the party in watching this series, but loved Juliana Margulies in ER. She shines in this series, balancing her reaction to the crushing news about her husband's infidelity and (possible) corruption, with the necessity to raise her children and find meaningful work. I find it compelling.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is an amazing film.  It is the first film I've seen in the theater that uses 3D to truly enhance the story and the movie-going experience.  In 3-D this is a breathtaking movie to watch.  But it is so incredibly well-done that the 2D version is just fine for home viewing, especially on a big-screen TV.
B00846TRHY|2.0|Very grainy picture -hard to watch! You need to improve quality of download  could not read the signs as the picture was playing, or any of the actors expressions!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory's heroine, Elizabeth Woodville, appeared in her earlier book  \\"The White Queen.\\"  She created an aura that could easily make the reader sympathetic  to the commoner queen married to King Edward.  A  few years later she creates another aura around the heroine of \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\"--Anne Neville, married to King Edward's brother Richard--causing us to wonder how we ever trusted the voice of Elizabeth Woodville as we now trust the voice of  her enemy Anne.  Gregory has this wonderful gift of becoming her historical characters and making us passionately care about their fate.  One only need read a history book, of course, to find out what happened, but historical fiction takes away the dryness of names and dates and creates, through the pen of an excellent writer, the immediacy of being part of that history. After finishing this book I now dislike Elizabeth Woodville's daughter Elizabeth but I know that while reading the soon-to-be-published \\"White Princess,\\" Gregory will have convinced me that the young princess, whose child will be the infamous Henry VIII, will be worthy of my sympathy and admiration because the author always portrays her female characters as they really were: although powerless and dominated by the men they loved or feared, cracks may have appeared, but they were never completely shattered.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Well written and acted. sally field is chilling in her awesome portrayal of Mary Lincoln.Solid performancers all thru this movie.
B0095H4FAA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was exactly what i wanted it to be. Finally mustered the energy and bought this book after enjoying the films and hearing such great reviews. Very pleased with this book and the price i payed for it!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I'm a big fan of the messed up heroes type of movie. This one delivered.  It reminded me a lot of Elizabethtown with the crazy family members, but much better acting and dialogue.  I found it funny, quirky, witty and heart warming all at the same time.  A definite must -see.
B00005B78P|5.0|This is a very nice background type of music CD.  It is very relaxing.  It is all instrumental but most of the songs have lyrics.  It is so enjoyable.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I am a big Ian McEwan fan. All his novels are well written and push the reader to think. This one uses a playful approach to narration I really liked. My only regret was that as an American, I missed some of the 1940s- 70's British historical and sociological references.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|This is my favorite BMTH album to date! I love their new sound and the fact that Oli is doing clean vocals now.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|The influences of the seminal industrial band Coil are evident here (a hermeneutical clue: HOW TO DESTROY ANGELS is the title of one of Coil's best albums).  What you have here is a minimalist post-rock revision of 1990s goth/industrialism.  Definitely a more mature sound.  The thumping disco beat of CLOSER is a distant, almost inaudible echo in HDA's polished electro-percussive tenebra.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Writing reviews is not something I am interested in doing. I work all week and don't feel like stringing a bunch of words together.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My daughter loves it....great graphics.... and a great app for only .99  so what else can I say about it......
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game... I wasn't real sure when I first clicked on it, but once I hatched my first Dragon, I couldn't stop... It's exciting to see what Dragon will hatch next and to mix and match them... and it's a continuous kind of game, I'm not sure you can beat it lol... so yes I definitely do recommend this game for all ages... I am 26 and no I am not the type to sit home and just play games, I do go out and hang w friends but when my son and I are home, we are checking on the dragons :) enjoy...
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Change my dear, and not a moment too soon. I love me some Doctor Who! I have to write more so here.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|Excellent acting, nice plot, funny.  I never watch a movie on my computer, but this one was really enjoyable and I watched the whole movie.
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|I love the mythos and seeing all my favorites from Arkham Horror in this game is fantastic. It took me a couple of games to figure out all the symbols and some basic strategy and now I'm generally pleased with the game. It's challenging and I haven't even left normal mode yet! My only complaint is that the one time I managed to win, the game crashed! I didn't get to see the ending sequence and reentering the game left me with a unresponsive black screen on my kindle. I'm going to update this the next time I win a game.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Great thinking game! This is the kind of game that I like to get for my kids: makes them think,  piece together clues,  and frankly,  it's fun for all of us. If you like Nancy drew games,  you will like this one.
B0038JN6VA|5.0|Great sound portable as advertised like it very much long lasting and strong product batteries last long fast rechargeable for everyone.
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|I have always loved Cary Grant, but this is one of my all time favorite movies. I loved the suspense and romance. I thought that it was very well written and the acting was spectacular.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Brand new and wonderful. Took a little while to get here but well worth the wait!! Love this film. whoot whoot
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I enjoy the skilsl, the judicial scenes and plot twists,  It keeps me watching and learning how the lawyers work.
B003R17BV0|3.0|The movie is okay and inspiring, but takes many liberties with the facts in order to make a Hollywood splash.  For example, the love story, and the fact that the Open didn't come down to Mr. Quimet's last putt.  The book is a great read and fills in many of the details that the movie is unable to provide.  All in all, it was worth watching, but I'd recommend reading the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the book because it was funny, sad and touching all in the same story.  It was had a good story line.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is tons of fun! Lots of puzzles to solve and lots of brain power needed=) Only drawback is it could be longer.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was an exciting book to read.  I walked the trail with the author, met  the folks she met, felt uneasy with a couple of them but mostly I loved all of the back packers.  My mind was cleared along with hers as I experienced the solitude of the wilderness. I always read all of the books I love at least twice.  I will be reading this one again soon.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Great easy read! I enjoyed every page of it! Especially the part about the SNL. I wish the part about the 30 rock creation was a bit longer!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a .moving \\"fiction\\"!  I can see each h character;  hear each speak;  feel the mud oozing through the toes of my scarred  feet.  CHRISTINA MCKENNA you made me weep with an aching throat at the variety of the jailers of that institution and made me cry with joy at the newspaper wrapping as they each were opened.  Thanks for the telling of this tale.
B008NMT684|5.0|my son loves it! easy and colorful plus it's all vehicles. and like they said,  no ads! great app, hope to find more like it.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I really enjoyed the story behind the scene.  The effects were awesomely done.  Seeing how the tiger & Pi became friends was an experience on it's own.  Anyone of any age should enjoy this movie.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I was expecting to get a bit more for the money on this LEGO set, but my son loves it and the shipping on this was quick.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|I own this movie on all 3 formats--VHS, DVD, & now BluRay.  The latter is the best for viewing.  But all the others still work well too!  But if you want to see it the best way possible, get a PS3.  They are by far the best player on the market!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|If you like puzzels and use to do mosaic art you will enjoy this type puzzel. Please make more of this type puzzel.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVE these books. I didn't see the movie because the previews did not appeal to me.  But, the books are GREAT!!!!!!!!!. I would recommended these for EVERYONE,
B002RI9UBS|3.0|The book is too long winded and takes  half the novel to start the story line which is very hard to believe.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|A very well written story, I did not want to come to the end, felt I was experiencing the story in real life.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|With the ending of the last book in the services I am looking forward to the next book in the series. Jeffrey Archer keeps you guessing and holds your interest from beginning to end and beyond!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|Never got it working on the Kindle Fire H D. Wasn't. Worth the effort.<br />1 2 3 4 5 6
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Great read. I recommend this book, but be prepared to do nothing but read until you finish
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|I chose this rating because there was a complete lack of even dry humor. Disfunctional families are not a good base for a story. Sharing the woes of falling business incomes, loss of ones home; all kind of a real bummer, not a feel good movie.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This game hasn't even installed yet and I'm already disappointed. The game has been loading for almost an hour and its not even a quarter of the way finished. Of course that's not as long as some of the other reviewers had to wait, but my patience is running out. When this game loads, IF this game loads, I'll be back with another (probably more positive) review.
1741794609|2.0|I've been using Lonely Planet guides for years now and I know they are hit or miss. This one is definitely a miss.  After a weekend trip to Agra, my best guess is that the authors haven't updated the information in this edition since it was first printed. The mid-range hotels that they said were good had definitely seen much better days and the restaurant recommendations were banal at best.  The Rough Guide India has much better maps and a lot more information about each sight.  Plus, and this may just be my pet peeve, I do wish that Lonely Planet would stop lecturing their readers!  I do not need to be told to not take the paper shoe covers at the Taj Mahal in order to help save the environment.  Seriously, perhaps not buying guidebooks would help the environment more.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This was perfect for my grand.  Lesson learned:  look at the inner side of a person. One of Disney's better stories.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have all the cut the ropes I can get I love them all there so fun and I think the little monster thing is so cute u should get the app
B0089LOG02|5.0|I love this writer.  It is the first book i have read by Christina Baker Kline and will look forward to reading another written by her.<br />The story keeps you wanting to know more about the two main characters.  The story is gracefully written in two generations.  The troubled girl who is working off community service organizing Vivians attic.  Vivian (91) and Molly ( 17 ) have more in common then they realize.  Molly is a foster child that got herself in trouble and if she does not do this community service she will be back in juvinal jail.  This is a captivating story and a must read.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|Let me preface this by saying, I never saw the stage-play in any form, at any time... So I went in, literally, with an open mind & a 'blank slate'. _ I tried my very, very hardest, to like this film/opera; but it is just horrible.<br /><br />Instead of selecting the best Voices, they selected the highest profile names they could cast, so long as they could sing well, to good... And the results speak for themselves. _ I loved \\"Phantom of the Opera\\"; and I even liked \\"Sweeney Todd\\" (as well as one, most viewing this film have likely never seen: \\"Repo! The Genetic Opera\\", which I also loved). _ H.B.Carter is the only thing that kept me from Loving \\"Todd\\" (vs. Liking it); and sadly, she's in this one as well, which drags to an unbearable degree at times.  (and I'm not even going to touch the story/script-problems, as that's a whole other icky ball of wax... and even if it's 'faithful' to the original story... there are still some pretty huge issues which weren't addressed, which desperately needed to be, to make the story more palatable to anyone older than 10, or with an IQ over 70).<br /><br />Even the actual songs were bad, unmemorable, etc., which means it completely fails as an Opera/Musical -- but since it was the only \\"Musical\\" of the year (barring perhaps, \\"step up 3\\" or other tween-drivel), it was nominated for several awards, even though it's horrid.  So, literally, \\"nominated by default\\", and yet they proudly proclaim everywhere they possibly can: \\"Nominated for .... Awards\\", LOL.<br /><br />Excluding the very first scene (slavery/ship scene), the Direction/Cinematography is almost completely non-existent, with the camera being constantly stationary during most songs... i.e., It's in a fixed position, and the Actor(s) stay on their mark, in close-up or semi-close-up, and sing, sometimes even looking straight into the camera (which is done purposefully)... even though it does nothing to add or enhance the scene/mood/etc.  If someone were to time the \\"stationary\\" shots, I bet it would amount to nearly 1/3rd of the film's run-time; and so you're constantly having to deal with the boring \\"shots\\" in conjunction with the boring songs... Not a good combination.  (watch \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" to see the proper way to Direct & Shoot a Film-Opera! -- Or watch Phantom if you want amazing singers, good songs, AND good acting, all at the same time... rather than, a sprinkle here, a sprinkle there, as it is in this \\"film\\".)<br /><br />I expected much, much more.<br />Hugh Jackman & the YOUNG Cossette are the highlights, w/ little else to praise.<br />Hathaway isn't in this movie long enough to be, genuinely, considered \\"best supporting\\" anything... but I guess the Awards people felt sorry for her since she let them 'shave' her head on screen.  (or because it was so \\"brave\\" of her to do it, LOL, as if it hasn't been done dozens of times before)<br /><br />If Hollyweird has ANY sense left, they'll put the Director (and the Cinematographer, if there even was one), on a \\"do not hire as\\" list... because they clearly are not capable of delivering anything of value... let alone, LASTING value.  (I'm sure there was a Cinematographer; but you have to wonder, with 1/3rd of the film being uninteresting, and LONG, stationary-shots!)
B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl really captures the era (or eras?) of Sound City and the intimate experiences of the artists who recorded there, and then whips it all into a frenzy with the studio project, Real to Reel.  So great!  Thank god those Seattle boys knew to drive down to Van Nuys in seeking fame...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Everyone must read this story... It is amazingly written. You will not be able to stop reading the story. It is a must read, and one of my favorites of 2013. I highly recommend it.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|In light of the recent Dubstep/Electronic/Trap explosion, Daft Punk has decided that they are tired of letting these amateurs feel good about themselves and recorded a tasty new album.  I imagine it went something like this:  Skrillex: \\"Ey, Daft Punk, you guys like, wanna do a collab or something?\\"  Daft Punk: *Silently look at eachother, arms crossed. \\"Non.\\"  And then they went back to being the best.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love the colar the texture is reat it was just what I needed, I am very pleased with this item

B00632HWOG|5.0|I do enjoy having this it is quite nice  Everyone should get it and use so very nice happy I did
B002WTC92E|4.0|After reading the horrific reviews of the \\"shallow\\" nature of this book, I was pleasantly surprised! So much so, that I read this book in one day-it just sucked me in like a sex and the city marathon that you can't help but watch even though you've seen that episode.<br />Is it a great literary piece? No. Is it written with purpose and intellectual bravado? Not really. Can a 30 something woman living in NY relate to the characters and find a bit of the ugly truth in each of them as they do in themselves? YES YES YES<br />I would imagine that there are a few types of people that don't like this book: those that don't like to hear the truth (yes! it's true...most of the time best friends are happy for each other, but occasionally there may be a drop of envy..it happens! no one admit it!!), those that don't understand 30 something in today's world (newsflash! the ring isn't really the \\"goal\\" of today's modern woman, though it's somewhat important), and those that are looking for a masterpiece. But look past this story, and you will see different parts of yourself...sort of like the way lord of the flies was really a breakdown of the psyche, this is like that, but yes on a much shallower and lighthearted level.<br />There are far more books with much higher ratings (fifty shades anyone?) that lacked the substance and true character development of this novel. Some may say I gave it too much credit or saw a bigger meaning than was there, but I found the character development to be quite impressive, the realness of the issues presented to be somewhat accurate, and was impressed that the author was able to convey these literary aspects into something that someone might consider a beach read. This is like a sit down with your best friends...<br />My two issues: the ending was a bit annoying as everything sort of got tied up nicely and/or ended too well (but we all have read and enjoyed fairy-tales, right) - so that was the most \\"unreal\\" part of the book and I don't like theuse of the word \\"frisson\\" (minor annoyance).<br />Overall, it is very sex and the city, but is that such a bad thing?

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Anyone who claims to like music but doesn't like Josh Groban is either unconscious or dead! His vocal range and his enunciation is immaculate and the quality of his voice is almost unbelievable.

He is without question the best male vocalist on the planet.<br />  Terry Peckham<br />  Denver, Colorado
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is AMAZING!! Im looking forward to reading the rest of them. Very deserving of a five star rating.
B003U69IX6|5.0|Grandson had read the book and enjoyed the movie.  He downloaded it to his WII.  It kept him entertained.  The price is right.  Instant movie.

B0071XO8RA|1.0|Amazon ratings have so far been pretty good finding me good books.<br /><br />However, this book is an exception.<br /><br />Of the five parts in omnibus edition, only the first deserve a star.
B0052U6KJI|5.0|These are extremely comfortable shoes. It took a few days for me feet and legs to get use to them but now they are amazing on my feet. The fit is great and they have a wide toe box. I'm hoping the anti-microbial coating on the inside will hold up

B001UGB1X8|4.0|This movie was a good one.  The plot was well laid out, just a little slow in developing.  Tommy Lee Jones did a great job as the sheriff, and detective in this small Louisiana bayou town.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Epic fantasy at its best!  Fully developed characters leaving the readers craving more.  I like how the book was written (a series of flashbacks intertwined with the present day.)  All the characters of the book are really interesting and you don't mind switching from one to another.  The magic system is top class!  So interesting and you are continuously learning more about it!  This book really develops a great new world.  It really feels vast but not overly so!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app, it is very realistic:) you compete in competitions and you feed and take care of the horse just like in real life:)
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Wait for it to go on free list! Complete waste of money and time.<br />What a total disappointment after reviewing national reviews before watching.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I haven't played this, but my son loves it. It was a disappointment that some of the free angry birds were HD only, since we have a Kindle fire, not HD, but that's just learning as we go.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Such a great track, I am really looking forward to the new album. The live musicians really made a difference here, and Draft Punk has yet again changed the game.
B0030B624E|4.0|I once tried to watch this movie when it came out. Nt sure what happened. Maybe I fell asleep, or wasn't that into zombies... Recently I became a huge zombie fan and went searching for this. Can't find it on ANY other service and you have to buy it in amazon to watch it at all. While I thought this was real annoying...I still bought it because well, I was going to watch this movie dammit!<br /><br />Totally worth it! Movie is awesome. On par with Dawn of the Dead. Need a ZLand 2 with the same cast.<br /><br />Not sure about this show but I will watch it regardless... Buy the movie!
B004EC5IUW|3.0|The movie is excellent, and the package is good. However being this an A/1 \\"The Americas\\" zone Blu-ray I would have expected it to have Spanish/Portuguese subtitles. It doesn't. This is not a big issue for me, since I speak English, so I bought it anyway. However it will prevent Latin American users that don't speak English from buying it. It's not acceptable that an Americas zone Blu-ray doesn´t have Spanish/Portuguese subtitles.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked it. Maybe not appropriate for young terns but I would recommend it to anyone of age. Overall good book
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I have nothing to say against it. Obviously it´s not a fresh as the Lord of the Rings was, but this movie is excellent...The only thing that I´m not very sure about is what they expect to put in the third movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose it because it was recommended. It is a good book and reasonably priced. The characters were well developed.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This album brings back some good memories of the Boz of old. Great music. I love the blues of old.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie is about spoiled white people and we found it to have some funny moments but overall...... not so good. Lets just say i am asking for a refund.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Pros:<br />1. Very easy to use.<br />2. Can use for many different types of kitchen knifes and scissor.<br />3. Great price
B001EC0ONG|5.0|So much fun when Tommy Lee shows up. His rapid-fire commands to everyone to do everything may not be realistic, but it sure is fun! Really the best part of the whole movie. The second half is less entertaining because more time is spent on Harrison Ford trying to clear his good name. Which is nice and all. But it's not as much fun as Tommy bossing everyone around!
B0087DIEGE|4.0|I shake my head in amazement when I read some reviews downrate the entire Olympus XZ-1 camera because they don't like the lens cap.  It appears they are used to the \\"leaf-type\\" devices used on cheap point & shoot cameras and don't realize how flimsy and vulnerable those are.  A grain of sand or a poke with a pencil to a leaf-type lens cap can make the whole camera into an unusable paperweight.  I don't know why XZ-1 users seem to be particularly sensitive about having a real lens cap instead of a leaf-type cap but the reality is that all \\"better\\" cameras use real lens caps, from the newer high-end compact cameras, to bridge cameras and all DSLR's.  A real lens cap simply offers more protection.<br /><br />But how cool is it that Olympus offers an option to install an auto-open cap if the owner chooses to.  I did make that choice, but I will still keep the real lens cap, and here's why.  Many times I am at events in which I want to be ready to shoot as quickly as possible.  While the real lens cap pops off automatically and is retained by a string from getting lost, the action of it popping off and dangling is a distraction and there is a risk the cap may get into the picture.<br /><br />The biggest downside of the LC-63A is that the leaves have a fairly substantial gap (see sample photo I uploaded).  That is a major concern at events that are inherently dusty like parades, rodeos, races, etc.  Given enough dust a pattern can form on the lens, having a very detrimental effect on the photograph.  The blades on the LC-63A are also very thin, offering not much more protection than the built-in leaf type caps on cheap cameras.  The upside is, unlike cheap cameras, if the LC-63A gets damaged you can unscrew it and throw it away, whereas with leaf-type caps you may end up throwing the whole camera away.  So bottom line, my preference is to use the real lens cap for protection while traveling, or if I know I am going to be in a very dusty environment, and screw the LC-63A on while shooting where I need quick response.<br /><br />A couple of other things to note ... the LC-63A is well designed and well put together and a bit overpriced, but considering that its function is to protect the lens on a high-quality camera, the price is not out of line.  Because it is a smaller diameter and only a slight fraction thicker, it actually goes into my eveready case easier and there is no risk it can be accidentally knocked off.  If you own a XZ-1, it is a nice accessory to have, but realize that it is more of a convenience than true protection for your lens.<br /><br />NOTE:  as the camera nears its end-of-life this lens cap seems to be getting more scarce.  If you feel you want one, it's probably best to order soon.  I didn't really \\"need\\" this but I have a gut feeling I won't be able to find it before long, so I bit the bullet and ordered one (direct from Olympus because it was discontinued at Amazon at the time and now the price has gone up substantially).n while shooting where I need quick response.<br /><br />A couple of other things to note ... the LC-63A is well designed and well put together and a bit overpriced, but considering that its function is to protect the lens on a high-quality camera, the price is not out of line.

B005LAII12|5.0|This movie was pretty hilarious. If you appreciate the humor in Family Guy you will appreciate the humor from Ted.  Overall, I got a lot of really good laughs.  Just FYI it's probably not a movie for kids just because it's about a teddy bear.  Also, if you grew up loving Flash Gordon you'll like this movie!

B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is a great show. The nature settings, the scenes in general the viewers are exposed to makes it very real, allowing the viewers to feel all the character's emotions. The humane side of it is great. The plot of Rich Spoiled Son goes through the traumatic experience of losing the most impt person in his life & making a Promise to later actually keeping it through a new reinvented character of himself is just awesome. Sometimes in order to become someone better, humble, compassionate we all need to lose a part of us or something.

Those books blew me away so when I was HOPELESS I got it with even reading a review just because I New that it was going to be amazing & well worth the money.... The characters are awesome. The story line is good everything flowed together with out confusion. I love Six even if she isn't in the book much & Breckin he is one of a kind.. Holder well hot dam I want him *just added to my book boyfriend list* but Sky well she was the best if all, I honestly don't know what I would have done going through everything she went through.. This is a must read!!! Won't regret :)

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoyed it.  Very good depiction of life in both Air Forces.  Caught myself googling certain terms and looking at photos of the aircraft mentioned.
B005LAII80|4.0|Great movie, especially in 3D.  It reminds me of the best of 80's action movies but with modern aesthetics, timing and story development taken into account.  The slow motion sequences are rendered beautifully and artfully, putting poetry in some otherwise gruesome violence.  The use of the 3D was very well planned and set up but the final execution of it is a little lacking when it came &#34;printing&#34; the final finished piece - it just seems to break up a little, technically speaking.  All in all, that little technical issue wasn't too distracting as I was/am fully engaged in the story, characters and cinematography.  I'm bummed that this didn't perform better in the theaters as that means that there may be little hope in a sequel(s).
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was less a mystery than a dissection of marriage.  The marriage in question was pretty awful (hahaha, understatement), but the sections exploring what they had done to each other from their viewpoints were engrossing.  The writing was clean.  I thought the ending weak - or maybe I was just disappointed.  Given the personalities of the embattled pair, it was probably true to life.  I don't read mystery/thriller etc, but this had generated so much talk, I tried it.  Glad I did.
B0052AJ1OO|3.0|Really good soundtrack to a good movie but I can't add the music on the disk to the digital music collection on my computer due to security on the disk.  Huge disappointment!
0307472841|5.0|There is something about Mankell's writing I dislike,<br />but I am completely captured by his novels nonetheless,<br />and this one is no exception...a wonderfully wide-ranging story<br />through time and culture, full of sadness and suffering<br />at the most human levels... a keen analytical interest<br />in contemporary China and where that country might tend to go<br />adds to Mankell's breadth of subject...<br />A true pleasure for the murder-mystery crowd, and a bit better than genre.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|One of the worst movie I've seen. Slow and boring and movie has no direction. Two thumbs down.  Would give it 0 stars!

B00B5A9FLY|5.0|To those who are disgruntled and unhappy with the way this marvelous series ended, you are free to do your own production and create any ending you desire.<br /><br />For me, this series has been more than great entertainment.  It brings to life the principles of \\"the hero's journey\\" as explained by Joseph Campbell.  The variations from the classic telling of this myth did not compromise the essence of each of the well-known characters.  There is much to ponder, ruminate and digest in this timeless story if you are looking for more than simply being entertained.  If you want \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" I suggest you stick with fairy tales.

I'm not one that wants a wall of noise but distinct music with great vocals, they seem to get better with each release.  If you want truly great metal this is it!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  Not so much like temple run as I thought it would be.  If you are on the fence of buying this game or not.  BUY IT!  When you are waiting for your girlfriend to come out of the shower or the dressing Rom you have something to do.  Its worth it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was well written, a thought provoking book. I had many conversations with friends about it. Everyone had a different idea about the ending. That makes for a good book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I don't play it like I said the kids usually play some other games so they play it sometimes ok
B007LB5MF4|5.0|Very good adaptation of an amazing series. It brought the books to life in a way the show never could have
