B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Have you ever picked up and book and thought...<br /><br />\\"This is going to be magical!\\"<br /><br />We do it often as children; the first time we read \\"The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe\\" or nab the last copy of \\"The Swiss Family Robinson\\" from the library. We are open, expectant, and still so full of wonder.<br /><br />I miss that...the older I get and the more I read.  The feeling I used to get when a new book was laid before me. How my eyes would light up, my breath would hitch, and this solid belief I possessed, that if I held that book close enough, or tight enough to my heart I could actually feel the words seeping into my bones. Etching their story into a place of permanence so I would never forget them. I could look at a book and think...<br /><br />\\"This is going to be magical.\\"<br /><br />And I would truly, honestly, believe it.<br /><br />Today that feeling was given back to me. Today...my eyes shimmered and my fingers tingled. Because today...I read \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" and my gut was right. It was magical.<br /><br />\\"Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie--magical, comforting, wise beyond her years--promised to protect him, no matter what.\\"<br /><br />For those of you that have read Neil Gaiman's work in the past, you already know he has a unique way of story telling. I'm not referring to his Gothic undertones (though they were slightly less under and more blatant tones this go round) or even his ability to incorporate childhood fables into the majority of his work. What I'm referring to is his narrative cadence.<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />I want you to think back to the last book you read. (Go on...this will just take a second. Promise.) When you were reading that story, WHO was relaying it to you? Chances are you HEARD everything from the character themselves. Am I right? This is often the case, and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with it. I'll be the first to admit I love living vicariously through characters. But this is not the case in Gaiman novels. Instead they read as if someone on the \\"outside\\" is reading it TO you. Like grandpa dropped by for a bite, and then decided to stay for an extra hour and tell you a story. They do not \\"sound like\\" words on a page, they \\"sound like\\" memories.<br /><br />He accomplishes this is by interrupting his own story.<br /><br />\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is (for a lack of better terminology) a flashback. The entire novel revolves around the lead protagonists memories. Because of this (rather engaging choice in plot formats) he is able to tell the story AND converse with the reader at the same time.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />\\"I was not scared of the dark, and I was perfectly willing to die (as willing as any seven-year-old, certain of his immortality, can be) if I died waiting for --\\"<br /><br />But these are all semantics aren't they? Hiccups in the face of what really matters. They story itself.<br /><br />And this is where things get complicated. I will NOT tell you about the plot itself; other than to say it was spectacular. I will NOT elaborate on the characters; other than to say they were beautifully developed. I will NOT convey to you my thoughts on the ending, because it is the glue that holds the entire novel together.<br /><br />Instead I'll tell you that this book is both enlightening:<br /><br />\\"Adults follow paths. Children explore. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurs to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences.\\"<br /><br />And frightening:<br /><br />\\"Perhaps I ought to turn you inside out, so your heart and brains and flesh are all naked and exposed on the outside, and the skin-side's inside. Then I'll keep you wrapped up in my room here, with your eyes staring forever at the darkness inside yourself.\\"<br /><br />It's insightful:<br /><br />\\"Nobody actually looks like they really are on the inside. You don't. I don't. People are much more complicated than that. It's true of everybody.\\"<br /><br />And realistic:<br /><br />\\"I went away in my head, into a book. That was where I went whenever real life was too hard or too inflexible.\\"<br />It told the truth:<br /><br />\\"Books were safer than other people.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm going to tell you something important. Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not on, in the whole wide world.\\"<br /><br />In short, it was everything it should be.<br /><br />It's expensive, but spend the money. It's worth every penny.<br /><br />Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: \\"And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.\\" - Roald Dahle beautifully developed.

B009Y6OIWC|4.0|A+ calendar is nice and easy to use. I am able to put my husband's work schedule and mine in the calendar and color code them.  At  a glance I can tell what day's and shifts we are working. A+calendar has another nice feature with b'day's. It allows you to put B'day's in with the year so each year after it keeps up with the correct age of the person's.<br />It would be nice if the holidays were automatically on the calendar and if you could print the calendar. It might be on the program some where and I haven't found it yet.<br />Overall good calendar.

B00821OX98|5.0|I got into this show because some friends of mine watch it and they said it was good. I am loving it so far!! There is a lot more mystery and uncertainty then I thought there would be. And they do a good job developing characters. It has everything a good show needs, and I would recommend this to anyone! Plus its free with Amazon Prime! So its a win-win!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was a difficult story to follow. I felt as though it had too many different story lines. It was hard for me to follow and the characters names and personalites became scrambled.
B000ICZD5M|1.0|There are some films that are so bad they're funny. And then there are a select few whose use has been ruled a war crime by the Geneva Conventions and the ICC.<br /><br />Dune is one of the latter.<br /><br />Run. Run while you still can...

B001AMNL2Q|5.0|If you are a fan of film, regardless of genre, you must watch this movie. Stanley Krubrick creates one of the most resonating, visceral, and harrowing war movies of all time. The first half of the movie is so affecting it may change the way you watch films.

B0089AD8IO|3.0|The dvds are ok, but all I can think about is the extra charge that was put onto my parcel of just over £12.00 to be able to collect it from a post office.  It came from America and so I was taxed extra and not enough postage was put on the parcel.  I'm disgusted.  It made for an expensive gift! Buyer beware!

0143122010|5.0|It is very \\"professional\\". Steven Pinker can sometimes seem like your \\"quintessential Harvard researcher. Very intellectual/not emotional. Very well documented. Feels like years went into this book. Surprisingly enjoyable read. I am definitely going to check out his other books. P.S. You must watch his talks on YouTube.
055380684X|5.0|The Talent Code is a well written account of how ordinary people can improve their skills and natural talent. Everyone who wants to get better at something can benefit from reading this book. The author's basic premise is that there is a way to learn that is better, what he calls \\"deep practice.\\"  This process involves breaking apart the technique involved and improving each piece. It also involves motivation and good teachers.  At the same time a reader should not get carried away with the idea that all it takes for success is to follow this method. I suggest reading the one star review rated as most helpful to get a counter view. While i agree with much that this reviewer says, I still think the book is well worth reading.  To give just one example, what is the best way to motivate students--praise their success or their effort?  The answer is effort. If you are a teacher or a parent this bit of information alone is worth the time and money for the book.<br /><br />Some points are admittedly overstated. For example the author states that the four minute mile barrier was a psychological one and once Roger Bannister broke it many other runners also ran sub-four minute niles. True enough, but improved training methods and track surfaces have also contributed to this result. Another overstated example is former UCLA basketball coach John Wooded, a great coach yes, but also the beneficiary of great players, Moreover other coaches have had success with different methods from Wooden's. The success of Brazilian football (soccer) players is also cited, but the reality is that Brazil has not won the world cup in recent years despite the individual talents of many of its players.<br /><br />In sum there is a lot to like about this book and some things to question, but it is very helpful for many people.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The last movie in the sequel.  Each one is as good as the others.  I will miss this wonderful series.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Got this, but quickly got annoyed by the ads wanting me to buy additional items and the in app purchasing.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The first part of the last book.  I truly love the series and all of the characters.  I am akid at heart.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|This movie is a classic.  There are plenty of reviews on the film itself, I'll just review the blu-ray version.  The transfer is from the original 70mm film and looks AMAZING.  You would be hard pressed to find a current film that looks much better.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio in 7.1 surround.  This movie sounds as amazing as it looks.  As with most old live action disney movies, there is a bit of singing throughout the film, but not enough to drive a non musical lover away.  Great transfer, great film!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Dud you really think thus was the  last we will see of them? Think again....there's so much going on that there no way she could wrap this up in one book.  Anxiously awaiting the next book.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|Very disappointed that this album only had 10 songs... i feel as if i was ripped off... some of the songs were o.k. others were just way out there, i appreciate his attempt at trying something new but this seems like a replica of 808s and heartbeat which i actually loved, but for some reason this wasn't sitting well with me. maybe if he had more songs I would have more opportunity to appreciate it.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|a little slower than other seasons. The last show was WOW.  Can't wait to catch up on Season 5 on Prime
B00D8WMASM|5.0|Cole took it back to his initial conscious rap days..  all the songs tell a vivid story that we can all relate in some manner or the other.. great job again by cole world.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Very enjoyable. Matt McConaughey is a fine actor who portrays his character extremely well. The plot is very interesting. Thanks
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|For those of you that have not watched The Shield yet, be prepared to get sucked into this dark, realistic drama.  The writing of the episodes is great and the actors seem to be the perfect fit for their roles.  I have watched the whole series and was sad to see it end.  Thankfully Amazon has the whole series included in Prime so I am able to relive the suspense and action once again.  This drama will defiantly get you hooked from early on and each season seems to get better and better!
0307887960|5.0|Ordered this as a used book. It was far from &#34;used&#34;. It was in perfect condition. Great price and fast shipper. Amazing diet! I lost 18 pounds and my boyfriend lost 30 something pounds. Such an easy diet to stick with :)

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app. Loved that it got rid of the toolbar button while I was playing, but it would pop up if I touched the side.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I picked the five star, because I have always been a fan of the 'Trek' genre, and I love to see how the earlier history works it's way into the present.  There are some things which take a bit getting used to, like, why are they always having trouble talking to so many different alien species, but, of course, no one just learns a new language overnight, so the Universal Translator issues are understandable.  You'll just have to watch and see I guess.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I expected this app, with the reference to the \\"Kindle Tablet Edition\\" after the app's name, to work on my Kindle Fire because the Kindle Fire is one of the forms of a Kindle tablet:  [[ASIN:B0083Q04IQ Kindle Fire 7\\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers]]<br /><br />But it isn't compatible.  That is very frustrating because \\"Bubble Witch Saga\\" looks like a classic \\"Jewels\\" type of game (the object is to line up similar colors and clear them off of the board), with a story line that helps to keep the game from getting boring.<br /><br />I went ahead and downloaded it because I may upgrade my device one day, and this game really appealed to me.  Or maybe the developer will make the app work on all of the Kindle tablets.  Meanwhile, I'm rating it at two stars (I don't like it) instead of one (I hate it) because it's a cute idea, and it has potential.<br /><br />For those who will undoubtedly complain it's not fair to downgrade the game's rating just because it won't work on my device, before you beat me up for my opinion, consider that the product doesn't deliver what is promised.<br /><br />When the app is upgraded to work on the Kindle Fire, I'll reconsider the rating. Is it too much to expect this app to work on MY Kindle tablet device?<br /><br />Original post updated on 6/24/2013 to remove FAOTD reference and to clarify information on Kindle Tablets.

0307744434|4.0|The Night Circus was a magical read. I really wish I had not been stressing out and studying for the GRE while reading this so I could fully appreciate it, but it was nice to be able to slip away from all that craziness and into the beauty that is this book. It was so easy to get swept up into the atmosphere of this book and I feel like the circus is what really makes this book amazing.<br />It was hard to get attached to the characters because the entire book you're jumping from one character to another and from one time or location to another time or location- so they don't have a lot of depth. It's a lot of jumping around, but Morgenstern really put a lot of detail into her circus- everything from the way the tent walls look, to the changing colors of Celias dress, to the way the clock moves. It's really magical and beautiful.<br />I hate to say that that the only reason I loved this book so much was for the descriptions of everything, but that's the truth. Like I said... the characters seemed to be a little lack luster, but that may be because the characters were submerged in this spectacular world. I don't know.<br />Also, the story line was not the most amazing. I read the summery and thought \\"Oh hell yeah. A dule? And they fall in love? Interesting!\\" No. False. Wrong. You shall not pass. There's not a duel. So put down your popcorn... there's not any action in this book. It's two illusionists who are simply forced to constantly perform magic until one of the poops out and gives up. That's your big epic battle.... sorry I ruined the surprise for you. It had potential to be an amazing plot... but it just was not executed in an exciting way---BUT. This battle does cause some beautiful tents and descriptions. So that's the plus side of the boring-ish plot. She says in an interview posted on Amazon, \\"It didn't have a plot for a very long time. Really, my biggest challenge was finding the actual story within all the atmosphere. I had the place and the characters and the feel of the book long before it had a proper story structure to tie everything together. The novel went through a great many revisions before it figured out what it wanted to be, I tried things that didn't work and then things that sort of worked and replaced old ideas with new ones until I got it right.\\" Knowing that the world was her main focus and the plot was more of a second thought makes me feel less guilty for liking the book only because of its descriptions.<br />So, do I recommend this book? Yes, because the imagery is worth it. It's not one that will be at the top of books I will suggest, but if you're a nerd who loves descriptions (like me) then you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />http://thebookmarkchronicles.blogspot.com/d the feel of the book long before it had a proper story structure to tie everything together.

B004IG6AG0|5.0|Black Sabbath takes you on a trip in this fantastic well-written album. I have been listening to this album for 37 years now and it has NEVER gone stale. It is fun for me to put different names in the place of Sweet Leaf I can put my own name there and relate, I have put all the Masters names there over the years, Krisna, Buddha, JESUS, Moses, Daniel, Mary many more... Master of Reality has a solid Mystical Feel that raises energy or consciousness. I always say \\"explore\\" for ones self and enjoy the trip. Sound vibrations have very powerful effects on our nervous systems and Ozzy's voice along with this bands finesse with metal is a mind-altering experience. The Lyrics are powerful still to this day. Tony Iommi's guitar work is always a pleasure to listen to. The Rhythm section is solid and super-tight. Bill Ward is an extremely powerful drummer and really pushes the energy right into the bone-marrow. Of course, I listen to this music loud by myself on a good stereo from beginning to end. This is a solid listen all the way through. The Lyrics are included so if you want to sing with Ozzy Go For it!
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I think this is one of the best games.but it does have room for improvement. The makers could take out the notes that are combinations of 3 notes.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|thinking of buying a watch that does it all? Well that would be the forerunner 405CX. Except little do you know, it will break down or die on you JUST as the warranty expires. This is a comment from someone who has owned and used the watch for over 2 years now and is dealing with Garmin Support. I AM NOT a new user, as I see most people are that say they love the watch are or have only had it for a short amount of time. I train for century bike rides and 1/2 triathlons and half of my training this past year I have not been able to use my watch because it has been sent into Garmin 3 times.<br /><br />What do you have to do to get a new battery? Pay Garmin $110 to send you a refurbished one that is even more worthless than the one you had originally (and that warranty only lasts 6 months). Honestly, this watch has so many bugs in the software and the battery life does not last what it should especially when you are a runner/triathlete or a bike rider that needs something to work for over 4-5 hours of exercise.<br /><br />BIG MISTAKE PURCHASING THIS Plus Garmin will just keep getting more money out of you in the end.<br /><br />I dont complain about much but to spend over $300 dollars on something, it should work and work well. This does not. Buy anything but this watch or if you can, buy something with a consumer replaceable battery or that IS NOT GARMIN MADE!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Super fun game but I finished it really fast and i saw that there are more worlds. But Amazon won't let me buy them<br /> :(

B00AECGQF2|5.0|I LOVE this game my sister's never get tired of it a lot of my games get boring after a week and I delete them or never play then again but I have had this game for 9 months now I luv it
B000000WGL|4.0|I wanted this. Pretty good over all, probably not his best work. If you're a fan then it is a must own.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|good its not fake but why is the box open when it got here and how many giveaways right there
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellent!<br />Easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable.  This book has the action of star wars and the easy read of a James Patterson book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very difficult  and challenging.. it's so much fun though.... everyone should play this game.. can't wait for more rooms to come out..
B00CWY76CC|3.0|On floor 2 I looked behind the playing cards, it's said 493 so I used it as a combination for the box, it didn't work, it should because u can't do anything else
B008JFUTUY|5.0|First heard about Rodriguez on 60 minutes last Fall. Probably the most unusual story in all of the history of music. I lived in Detroit in the early 70's. Great time for Great Music! CKLW!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish that I had been aware of him at that time. I am going to Radio City Music Hall in October. So excited.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|one of the best books ever i loved it so freaking much i would prefer it to everyone may the odds ever be in your favor
0316228532|2.0|What if you were to take all of the characters in the Harry Potter series, removed the magic and wizardry and spells, and transported them to two little towns somewhere in England? Would anyone care to read the ensuing story of small town politics, and smaller-town lives?<br /><br />I suspect if the name wasn't \\"Rowling,\\" nobody would've bothered much with this story. It's long. Like so long by the time you're a third of the way through the book, you wonder if the plot is ever going to move forward. Molasses running in the winter moves faster than this story.<br /><br />And the cast of characters! You only have to keep track of something like 2 or 3 dozen of them. Much like a soap opera, Rowling tries to show us each of their motivations and backstories, but it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all. Honestly, I'm not even sure who the central character of the book is.<br /><br />I'm being generous when I gave this book 2 stars. I actually feel it's closer to 1 1/2 stars, because the writing is good. But like many who read this book, I'm not from England, so many of the English-specific terms, cultural references and societal idiosyncrasies -- even the language in some places -- are largely lost on me. And there's a lot of them.<br /><br />We now know Rowling's writing style beyond a doubt. Tell a story filled with so many characters, you either love it or want to gouge your eyes out in keeping track of them all. I'm in the latter category. A faster-moving plot would be delightful as well.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|This was an awesome purchase. Even though the radio plays lots of their songs some haven't been played or at least I haven;t heard some tracks in years. Awessome!
B00008FK14|5.0|I love this LP. I bought it on CD when it came out and never had the LP until now. Sounds Fabulous. Love It Every song is great.
B002WJI66C|5.0|My son and my nephew have been very pleased with toy!! I got one for each of them. Don't see this in stores out in the boonies!
B005544TRQ|5.0|The two main characters work together and they have great antagonists in this show.  Very witty dialogue and not as fast as Aaron Sorkin's writing.  (Newsroom on HBO)
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Awesome band! REALLY awesome singer!!!!!!! I heard them on satellite radio a couple of times. I finally, looked them up and now have seen them perform on tv twice! Awesome purchase
B009AMAGXK|2.0|Someone commented that they don't like / feel a movie review should involve the book from which it originated.  I think that is absurd.  I bought this movie based on my enjoyment of the book(s) and was looking to see the characters come too life.  This movie was obviously a studio's rush to get something on film to capitalize on the popularity of the book, not because they wanted to make a worthwhile and faithful companion to the book.  I realize that compromises are made in taking a book to movie, but there should be a limit to how totally different the movie can be and, if I was the author, I would have never agreed to the movie in this form.<br /><br />So, echoing some other reviewers on here regarding characters and their places in the story, where was Marian, a critical character from the book?  Why was Amma, a cajun/voodoo/seer working in the library instead of running Ethan's house? Seers weren't responsible for the library, Keepers where. Where were the \\"Great Ones\\"?  Where was the Genevieve and her story? Where was Ethan's \\"crazy\\" dad that he had to protect?  Where was Boo Radley the caster dog? Where were the Sisters / Aunts?  Why was Ridley an older, slim brunette instead of more of a teenage Marilyn Monroe look-a-like?  Where was the \\"spirit\\" of Ethan's mom who provided so much guidance and was so important to the story? So many important / critical characters left out / changed for convenience.<br /><br />As far as the actual story and critical components, what happened to Kelting?  Where was the battle for Lena where is was determined that Ethan was her protector, not house / binding (movie scene was SOOOO anticlimatic)? Where was the sixteen / shadow song?  How did the Book of Moons show up in the Caster library instead of the tomb and how did it become so insignificant? Where were the dreams that Lena and Ethan shared both before and after meeting? When it comes down to it, where was the unbreakable link between Ethan and Lena?  Where was Ridley's grasp on Link, used to influence Ethan?  What happened to the threat to Ethan's father to distract him from protecting Lena?  Of course, they didn't really need the threat to Ethan's father since Lena erased herself from his memory, which surprisingly (insert sarcasm) never happened in the book).  Why in the world did they change the whole climax of the movie to Link shooting Ethan only to have it turn out to be Macon?  What happened to Sarafina, Lena's mother, killing Ethan and Lena having to make the critical choice?  Why did they rush through the whole thing, developing very little (anything?) in any detail?<br /><br />Finally, they totally trashed the curse and its power, instead making it a fairly easy problem to defeat even if it did mean the death of someone Lena loves. In the book, its not nearly so simple and, in fact, Lena really only avoids the curse for the time being while having to knowingly sacrifice Macon which haunts her through the next book.<br /><br />Speaking of the next book, if they make a sequel to this movie the same way they made this movie, with the same faithlessness and total lack of honor to the book, then I for one would have no interest in seeing it and neither would the 2 other friends who watched with me and were also sorely letdown.  This potentially could have been the next Twilight-like series, but instead was a big disappointment.<br /><br />Was this is decent movie?  Sure, but read the book and find out how it could have been so very much more...
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Awesome band! Really awesome singer! I heard them on satellite radio several times. I finally looked them up and saw them perform on tv twice now. Awesome purchase!!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Brandon probably could have finished the whole series in 3-5 novels!  The pace of the book is great and he did a good job tying up most of Jordan's 6 million sub plots and minor characters.
0141033576|4.0|Definitely a must read<br /><br />You may find that many concepts already known but what makes this book a must read is the framework that the author proposes and a ton of wisdom<br /><br />4 stars because the book could have been more structured and readers expectations could have been made clearer
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Its a very good timepass game..I enjoy it.... Addictive, nice and pretty :-)  Fun game with challenging levels. pip pip dang dang
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Just awesome need I say more yes because its so real like and awesome it is truly the best game I have ever played
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a fun free game. Not very complicated but enjoyable and great visuals. If dragons are your thing be sure to add this yo your group of games.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|me and my son play it and we enjoy it very much<br />it is challenging and lots of fun and it is different
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Fast, fun read. If you like Jack Reacher, you will roll with this one.  Reacher books are perfect for airplane trips.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Very well done script.  It keeps you following the drama.<br />It changed my whole perception just after a few minutes in the film
B006MW3V6U|5.0|is just as great!  I recommend it to everyone.  Each episode I watch makes me anxious for the next...I cannot wait to find out what happens.
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|I like my Black Keys dirty and raw.  The newer albums seem to lack the grit of the old.  This album is as dirty as they come and therefore one of their best.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game for the family. Especially my 5 year old. Great game when your bored. I just enjoy the elite part of it.
B00CRW2066|5.0|The National is back.  While I loved the last album it lacked some of the fire of Boxer and Alligator.  This album traveles back to their roots and beautifully blends all their strengths.  The slow and the fast, this album has it all.  Great album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very fun you get your own horse that you get to compete with and train.  You also get to feed it and brush it!  I totally recommend this app!!
074401493X|3.0|Despite the fact that, we get a cool looking &#34;Firefly&#34; Pendent keychain, and a slick Matt hard cover Strategy book.  It is completely not as USEFUL as it should be as a strategy guide.<br /><br />I've read plenty of guides, from Kingdom Heart Series, to Final Fantasy Series.<br /><br />Guides were meant to be straight forward and tell you many things about the game and would literally explain to you what should happen if you follow that guide.<br /><br />This guide, does that, but Extremely vague, from time to time, it'll literally tells you to do this, but it doesn't tell you much about the outcome and how to approach rest of the situation of that time.  Thus, the guide is VERY disorganize.  There are times where I should be reading the bottom texts instead of the right column of the text, and there are times that I should do the other way.  And from time to time, I'll have to flip back and forth just to find the exact place of certain hidden in game items.<br /><br />1 thing I really dislike about this game is that, the game was not written base on the HARDEST difficulty, which was &#34;Survival&#34; mode, since it was written in only Hard mode.  In that mode, there are little to no extra drop items in the playthrough, therefore you have to save even more items a head of time.<br /><br />Another bad about this guide is that, the writer doesn't really tell their opinion on which weapon to upgrade, and why they did that.  They just tell you, oh, here are these weapon, and the available upgrades for it.  As a guide, shouldn't the writer at least tell us what they upgraded and why? Therefore, we can grasp the situation that might come later on in the game.  But nope, all they said is, here are the stuff you can upgrade, do whatever you want.<br /><br />In conclusion, it is awesome to get a pedant and a slick book cover, but other than that, the guide is a complete mess.  There should be more time and effort to be put into the guide.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Quite challenging but not in a frustrating way. I couldn't put it down once I started playing it. My daughter even found it fun. I am j<br />interested in seeing other games like this
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves this movies/show/cartoon.  She will watch it from start to finish.  If your child likes monter high, don't hesitate to get it for them.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Never heard of Macklemore or Ryan Lewis before and was not a fan of the opening single \\"Thrift Shop,\\" however the rest of the album is complete and utter gen
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I think this game is so fun and addicting its really cool and its super addicting to all the haters u suck
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great read by one of our best contemporary authors.  Engaging and informative, although not as wrenching as his last book.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app, but it's really easy to lose coins and gems. And really hard to gain them back. But I still love this app!
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Two listens, (careful, not as background music!) and I am sold.  Yes, some initial checking the speakers for vibrations, I will admit, so you people who bought vinyl should know it also sounds that way in digital.  The mud factor: not my favorite quality, I'm hoping it is a trend that will pass.  I have the same problem with The National and their addition of too much noise to otherwise excellent tunes.<br />  How to describe this to others?  Maybe Mumford and sons (instruments) meets Eagles of Death Metal (vocal timbre) meets Sufjan Stevens (speed of introspection)  meets Empire of the Sun (electro pop), but you won't be dancin'...you will be transported. It is lovely.
B004KBSQOW|3.0|She felt too repetitious to listen to whole CD but really enjoys specific songs of cover-tunes Thanks, especially the wonderful version of Somewhere over the Rainbow.
B005LAII80|5.0|Excellent adaptation that is true to the sprit of the comic. The Stallone mess to Dredd 3D is like Adam West's 60's Batman to The Dark Knight Trilogy.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is a fantastic writer. This book is so easy to relate to and honestly made me feel every emotion whilst reading it and it also made me cry, which not many writers can do. I will definitely be getting more books by John Green.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|So easy to use.  Not all bottles work.  Wine bottles worked the best if they were not funny shaped.  Beer bottles were unpredictable.  One would work perfectly and the next 4 would not work at all.  Out of 8 wine bottles....only 1 cracked badly!  Love my new glasses. So do my friends!
B0055B7IPE|1.0|Would not load on my daughters kindle.tried to get a refund but was unsuccessful. Sure it's a great movie. Would've loved to have seen it.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|By far on par with Iron Man (first)...this was a significant achievement.  I can advise that you do not want to miss a word Robert Downey Jr. says (funny as hell)...he is and forever will be THE Iron Man!  Kind of reminds me of Popeye who would often speak under his breath (the most meaningful thoughts).  You will NOT be disappointed; however, I did not view this is 3D, but certainly will on this DVD set.  I just wish Amazon was a bit more gracious with the setting price...a bit steep for my wallet.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this game! And for the people complaining that dragons cost too much, u can breed all of the dragons except for earth, water, Sun, and more. I love how I can get all these awesome dragons
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Great combination of humor, action, and story. Has the qualities I loved from Harry Potter set in a modern day world of Greek mythology.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|Most of the book is recipes and testimonials - the science of fasting is lightly covered.  There is enough info on teh internet that you don't need to read the book
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Every bit as good as season one and ends with you wanting more. all the characters return and the season basically covers what happens to the family during and after WWI
1451695195|5.0|I loved this book.  I have always believed in an afterlife.  Dr. Alexander's personal experience is one I found to be very inspiring.  It was generous of him to share and to write this book.  After being a skeptic, his experience was so life changing that he has given us all the gift of his writing.  I'm going to read it again and pass it around.  I think reading this will be inspiring and life changing for many.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Good game but for amazon users, the new meltdown udate hasn't came out so if your smartphone has a ios store get it on there
B0063IH60K|5.0|I forgot how nice it is to take some time between never ending tasks and just play a simple game. It recharges you and nothing is as enjoyable as a quick game of Solitaire. I'm glad I got this game.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Love the CD, great songs, great album. rock and roll. could listen to it over and over again. thank you.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Easy to play.  Nice layout of tiles, have ability to redo board or shuffle, exclude of timed or not, etc.  Challenging boards.  Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is really fun but really short, only 10 levels. not overly challenging.can't wait for more levels. works great on kindle fire.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|Definitely worth of watching. I wish they can continue with at least on from Universe, Altantis, SG or at least come up with new one
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This is an old fashioned good movie. We watched while camping and then watched it again the next night. It is a great movie and I hope they make more.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very prompt, shipped as requested I will use them again. This is the first time I have used this  source.
B001CJJWWA|5.0|I watch this on regular basis. I am an &#34;early Jazz fan&#34;, can't get enough of the stuff. Wish all Amy Winehouse fans the best.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This has been a very successful translation of the Sherlock Holmes story into the modern age. The characters are engaging, believable, and well cast. The stories are interesting and non-obvious, and plot twists are almost always believable. I will be very interested to see in season 2 how the Moriarty story arc is addressed.
B002HR1W1K|4.0|For Americans, what can I say, but &#34;British humor.&#34; You either appreciate it or you don't. I think this movie is hilarious
159463176X|5.0|The author continues to be one of the best storytellers around. Characters are believable, stories spellbinding and it all works together for a most delightful read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommended it to my book club.
B001KEHAI0|4.0|Bill Murray. Comedy. What more can I say? I'm not sure. I love this movie. Harold Ramis made a great movie. Kudos.
B0091QS88K|4.0|There is not much to this app. It's pretty repetitive but my 4 yr old spent about an hour playing it the first time. She loves it. She gets so excited when they enjoy what she prepared for them. It's cute. Not sure how much the paid app adds...looks like just one more level.
B004BBDHEK|4.0|I love all of Yanni's music, but I do not like a lot of singers in his songs; I like when the background singers do more sounds than words.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was an apsolute pleasure to play. There are ten rooms so far and all of them take every ounce of observation and smarts you have. I cant wait until I can play more!
B00786XVOG|5.0|I like the original Yanni, this concert has a lot of my favorites! Concert CD's usually are the best of the best songs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This games is very cool. It requires a lot of thinking. I like that about a game. Kind of like flow but with more strategy.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was a beautiful and emotional book.  The character and integrity of our elite military as a whole is inspiring.  Reading and learning of an individual who suffered many setbacks to see his will and love for his family and country is overwhelming.
B008US4PBY|4.0|I got the Cronus with a wired Xbox 360 controller. Plugged it into the PS3 and it worked like a charm. No weird configurations needed or anything. However, the wireless receiver that came with it broke in half immediately after first use. I had it plugged in to the Cronus and upon removal, the receiver snapped in half. It was almost stuck into the Cronus. I eventually figured that you have to carefully life whatever is plugged in up in order to take it out, as if it is locked into the device.<br /><br />The second time I removed my controller, the plastic cover for the Cronus came off completely but I managed to snap it back together. As long as you are extremely careful with it, it'll work just fine but don't ever drop it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its entraining....and helps you to look for solutions outside the box and will keep you on it till you find the way out
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this show and was so glad to get it as quick as I did.  Love it love it
B002NT3B52|5.0|The author reminds me of Dr. Temperance Brennan of the t.v. show &#34;Bones&#34;. She has carefully communicated her thoughts, and in her own way is quite humorous. I found myself bookmarking whole pages. It made me cry a few times when I read some of the things that she wrote about her own dog.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the game for you if you like to build. This is the world's largest sandbox.<br />You can play with friends. Use you imagination build what you what. IT IS AWESOME.
1451627297|4.0|This is the first Stephen King book I've read in more than a decade, and I picked it up because it has some similar themes to my current novel-in-progress. I'm not a huge fan of horror, so haven't enjoyed the books of King's I've read previously (It and Kujo), but while 11.22.63 contains some horrific scenes, I definitely wouldn't call it a horror. It's more alternate history/time travel/dramatic fiction.<br /><br />I found some of the passages about Lee Oswald a little boring, but that may be because I'm Australian and not really interested in the true historical aspect of the novel, more the concept of changing a major historical event and the impact that would have on the present. I was disappointed that the book didn't spend more time on the consequences of changing the past.  I'd expected a reasonable amount of time to be spent back in 2011, showing us how JFK's continued presidency changed America (especially considering the blurb played up this angle), but of a 735 page book, only 35 pages covered the consequences of Jake's changes.<br /><br />However, I really enjoyed Jake's narration and found him to be a very relatable character, despite the unique circumstances he found himself in. I was totally engaged by his and Sadie's love story, and the scenes of Jake as a teacher (particularly the effect he had on his students) stood out as highlights for me. I thought Sadie was brilliantly crafted. Out of all the characters in the novel, she was the most three dimensional, and I really rooted for her and Jake to have a Happy Ever After (what can I say, I'm a romantic at heart).<br /><br />Although I didn't quite get what I was looking for with this read, I still thoroughly enjoyed it overall.
B008PPUMVY|5.0|I would have loved this album even had I not been going through a hard time in my life...a particularly hard divorce. This was one of the few things that could put a smile on my face. Yes, it is very funny as only Frank could be. And yes it has one of the most beautiful guitar solos I have ever heard (Watermelon In Easter Hay). This was not just some comedy album however. Zappa was on the attack toward bogus religion and censorship. Add the playful side of Zappa to it all and you really have a great work of art. This never gets boring and I can still listen to it after all these years and expect to be listening to it occasionally as long as I am alive! Thank you Mr. Zappa for all of your wonderful work including this!
B009NY43NY|5.0|i loved this but this really is not the last book she has one coming out with about Sookie future just last in series with an actual story line. BUT hey the time when i read this just flew by and i was so glad i could get this on my android to read;.) Thank you but i do feel this was misrepresented to the readers that this was the last book ever as in it does not tie up all the lose ends for everyone as i will be preordering the new book to come out from her in OCT of this year so i can see how she ties up all the loose ends that were left in this book for Sookie and the other characters like JT's twins. i wish she would keep this series going. I love this more than any other series i have read!!!! Still to me some have commented this is the last book to me but yeap well it is but not really b/c she is putting out this new book about the series to tie up the future of the characters so hey to me this sounds like a new book about the old series.<br /><br />Here is what the new book is about:<br /><br />New book is: After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse<br /><br />This is what it says it is about:<br />Dead Ever After marked the end of the Sookie Stackhouse novels--a series that garnered millions of fans and spawned the hit HBO television show True Blood. It also stoked a hunger that will never die...a hunger to know what happened next.<br /><br />With characters arranged alphabetically--from the Ancient Pythoness to Bethany Zanelli--bestselling author Charlaine Harris takes fans into the future of their favorite residents of Bon Temps and environs. You'll learn how Michele and Jason's marriage fared, what happened to Sookie's cousin Hunter, and whether Tara and JB's twins grew up to be solid citizens.<br /><br />This coda provides the answers to your lingering questions--including details of Sookie's own happily-ever-after...<br /><br />The book will feature extensive interior art by acclaimed Sookie artist Lisa Desimini, including a Sookieverse Alphabet, color endpapers, and several full-page black and white interior illustrations.<br /><br />Either way ill be enjoying this and i am hungry for more:.)
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Playing on Kindle Fire is nice.<br />Game play is easy so far..Good time killing game!!<br />Not building as fast I would like
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Wonderful lyrics sung to a beat that captures your heart. The writer singer is fantastic. He was ignored in the US but cherished in South Africa. No one knew who he was until the making of the documentary Searching for Sugarman. Do not miss this album.<br />Libbie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best escape games I've ever played :) Level seven was a doozy, cant wait for more! !
0761171703|5.0|This is a &#34;must have&#34; book!  I keep it on the coffee table. The photography captures dancers in motion inside, outside and all around the town. The joy of dancers, some well known and others dancing as strangers, capture the spirit and the talent of so many people. It will brighten your day and put a spring in your step! The photography is outstanding.<br />Libbie
B007REV4YI|5.0|This title does not disappoint!  If you love Bond, this film is a must get for your collection. I loved it!
0399162097|4.0|There are so many in-depth reviews of this book that I won't even try my hand at it. But my reaction - in the beginning I found it readable and interesting, and I have to say the author must have done a lot of research on the subject (either that or she made stuff up that sounded pretty authentic.)  I admire her for undertaking what must have been a difficult book to put together. About half way through (when we return to the narrator at college), it began to feel monotonous, and a bit over the top unbelievable. I didn't understand why the parents weren't upset about their son, or Rosemary. Or much of anything really. They were not only unsympathetic, they weren't realistic. And once Harlow entered the story (except for the initial couple of scenes) I felt the book began to fizzle.  Bottom line - an interesting concept, mostly well played out, but it could have been better.
1451613512|3.0|the book that was viewed on line was a first edition. The book that we  received in the mail received was not. My husband was very disappointed as he is the collector of first editions and I am the one who suggested to give Amazon a try..
0785152458|5.0|Came before it said and was in perfect condition. The only exception was a small dent in the bottom corner but you can tell it was from packaging and not the condition before hand. Can't wait to read this one! I loved the first one and the movie as well. I'm reading this before so I can see the second movie in August and dress up for the premier
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very good show. Conveniently free for Prime members. It was nice that you had access to it prior to hulu plus.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|This show has everything needed to make an epic series. Superb acting, characters that draw you in, disturbing yet intriguing storyline. My husband and I are addicted!
0525478817|5.0|I picked up this book by chance at an airport, using my usual algorithm: reading the first sentence and deciding whether it was captivating enough to make me want to continue reading. Clearly, it was.<br /><br />There are many good things to be said about this book, but the one that mattered to me the most was its unshielded honesty. Sick people are not glorified, angelic fighters against their disease with family and friends faithfully by their side. Instead, they pee themselves and throw up, they bitch and moan and hurt their loved ones, they alternate between wishing they were healthy and wishing they were dead. Their friends abandon them and their families often can't offer more than empty, nauseatingly bland inspirational quotes. But through all of this they find each other, they grasp and understand each other, they grow to love each others' souls while their bodies are slowly decaying.<br /><br />And yes, as it has been mentioned by previous reviewers, they use a language so glorifying and grand that it borders on ridiculousness, and that seems completely unsuitable for 16-year old kids. For a moment I, too was sceptical about it. And them I remembered being 17 and in love for the first time, and how everything felt larger than life; and that was for me, who knew she would have many more of those romances yet to come. How much grandeur must lie in a love like this for a kid who knows it will be their last, their one and only??<br /><br />It is a book that made me burst out in laughter in the beginning, and grow more and more emotional and melancholic as the protagonist slowly drops her protective wall of cynical indifference and acknowledges her fears and wishes and fragility. But, most importantly, despite the deeply sad topic, the book remains surprisingly life-affirming, continuously reminding the reader why throughout all the pain and desperation life is so, so, so worth living.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really enjoyed the game. I will continue to play Big Fish games this one had me thinking it was one person then I changed my mind only to find out I was right with my first thought.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Fun. Lots of games and match 3's. I can hardly get grandchildren off the game. Would buy another game like it.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This was pure movie magic! Great cast, great story, great cinematography - this is what film making should be. *Spoiler alert* could these be Dorothy's parents??? (The Kansas version Glenda and Wizard.) Rent or buy this and enjoy because this is what a great family friendly movie is all about!
B0071XO8RA|2.0|The plot was a bit dull and plain for me. I got really bored half way through, kind of forced myself to finish it. At the same time I was reading \\"Ready Player One\\", couldn't put it down. If you read and liked \\"[[ASIN:B000FBJCJE Snow Crash]]\\" in the past, you would enjoy \\"[[ASIN:B004J4WKUQ Ready Player One]]\\".
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I bought this book, and it was so bad, I took it back to the store the next day and got a refund. This is the most horrible rip-off of 50 SHADES OF GRAY, that I have ever read, at least if the 50 shades series is considered bad, it was originally written, and i enjoyed all three 50 shades books, even as a guilty pleasure. Do not buy this book, it is not worth the money. Buy the original 50 shades of gray
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love playing this game with the adventure!!  Great graphics great fun great great great game have fun just like they say it is!!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Soooooo disappointed. I stayed up till 3am reading this book thinking I was finally getting to the meat of it and NOTHING.  It just stops before you get to anything. So irritated. I know I will NOT be buying the next one. This just screams money hungry to me.... stretch it out to get a few more sales. I will not be buying anymore Sylvia Day books.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I couldn't put this down. It's a familiar formula, but not real predictable, and steadily entertaining! Cant wait for more Will Robie from Baldacci. The teen protagonist could easily carry a novel or meet up with Robie for another thriller!
B007SY3CEW|1.0|I got the app and it said that there was an internal error and I couldn't play the app. when I tried to play something else it said the same thing. as if it were a virus. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!
0374533571|4.0|Having seen e movie, I wanted to enjoy more time with this family. Te novel and film have enough differences to surprise and inspire as stand alone entertainment. The cause of Pat's behavior/life change in both instances are things that so many families deal with, the story is very relatable. The humor and wisdom are touching. Loved both!
B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|The best film in history of cinema. One of my favorite films and the best film of Kurosawa. I love it.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Pretty good movie overall. Great action, cool story line, decent acting. This movie is one of the few 3D movies I've seen that had amazing jump out at you graphics! It's a winner in my book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would recommend this book to cayden I liked because it has great humor and is uncle Garry and that's it's
B0009X7664|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic and suitable for all family members.  The plot is excellent, actors are superb, and it is a good example of family life.  Everyone should view this film.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Be happen forever you well be in love if make you happen for ever  I like to be with you forever in my heart  do you love me who I am  please be with me am it  I love you forever but I love you  can't you love me some time  if you cant not love me I guess we breaking up forever way you made  breaking up forever  why you E
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like having a place to keep my music that is not as restrictive as iTunes!!  Well worth using it!!
B005CRQ3H0|5.0|Although I was not alive during this era of American culture, Pynchon does an incredible job of allowing the reader to understand and visualize the time period and setting of California and the west coast during the early 1970s and before. The characters develop right before your eyes as the story twists together and intertwines in ways you don't predict until you're late for an event because you can't stop reading (this happened multiple times while I was reading it. Pynchon works well with several themes throughout the whole book and elaborates on some such as \\"hippie\\" culture of the 1960s and post-Vietnam era America while still peppering in relevant culture (music, movies) of the time and a good deal of humor. An overall great read, I would recommend it for anyone interested in late 1960s- early 1970s American culture and mystery novels.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|Waited the whole movie for some redeeming value.  Sad movie.  True but no entertainment value. Would be good if you were doing a study on the problems associated with drug abuse.
B004L35GAQ|1.0|If you're already a fan then sure, get this. If you're like me you heard Sail, thought it was alright, and decided to give the album it's from a chance. Well, the other songs on the album aren't anywhere close to being similar to Sail. It's unique among the album's musical style. So if you're wanting more of that you won't find it here.
1587613379|5.0|I bought this book to read for sociology as an extra credit assignment, but decided not to do it because I locked in my A. My sister on the other hand wanted to read it. This book contains all the possibilities besides a monogamous relationship
B009MO5960|1.0|I've hated all of the resident Evil movies ever since the first one came out, the fact that there still making them makes me just plain mad. For anyone who's wasted their time and money on this garbage knows that the movie one again stars Alice as she teams with a group of survivors to fight of the evil Umbrella corporation from taking over the world quite frankly i've never cared about the alice character in any of the movie. This is one of the rare times I actually cheered for the bad guys hoping they would kill Alice in order to put an end this franchise once and for all. Leon and Ada from Resident Evil 2 make an appearance but like all the game characters they're simply played off as secondary characters. If I hear they're making another movie I swear i'm going to break something.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One best programs out there.  A must watch.  If you like mystery type of programs this the best I have seen.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Love the actors, love the story...be sure to watch it several times to get all the nuances.  Romance for elders!!
B007SNMYNS|5.0|Easiest diet ever for me.  Don't need to think, just avoid wheat.  Still lots of choices, even in restaurants.  Have noticed immediate results.  Glad I read it.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|This is not a film, it's an endless fever-dream of torture and interrogation. Where's the story? Where's the character development? Plays like a raging video game not a feature film. It needs to be hidden away in a hurt locker and blown up before this kind of film-making ruins the industry.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Quality acting by everyone in the cast, original and moving musical numbers, plot definitely worthy of a weekend TV binge.  Very satisfying.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseni had a lot to live up to following his first two novels and he succeeded. A wonderful and movin read! highly recommend it.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|For years, now, I had felt Disney had lost their touch. This movie proves they've got it back. Spot-on voice-acting, shout-outs and humor for viewers of ALL ages, and heartwarming moments aplenty. WARNING: Have kleenex ready. This movie WILL make you cry at LEAST once.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Slaughterhouse five is one of the best books I've read. I have ADD so I cant keep focused very well, but while I was reading this book, it was hard for me to put it down. I believe the reason this book caught my attention so well was because of the constant &#34;jumping around&#34; or time traveling the main character does in the book.<br />Because of this book, I finally found what I wanted as a first tattoo. &#34;So it goes&#34;. This one line is so short but it carry's a significant meaning. I won't spoil it for anyone who wants to read this book, just know its significant.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is literally the 2nd best game ever only series of games better is pokemon black and white 2.I can't wait until it's sister game comes out which is called Gizmonauts
B00D9CDTUY|2.0|I sent Amazon customer support an email regarding the garbled sound on this and the woman who got back to me had watched the movie herself and agreed that there was a problem with the sound.  She refunded me my $10 (thus the two stars) and said that tech support was looking into it.  As of the end of June (two weeks later), the sound is still garbled.  If you buy this and it's of poor quality, don't be shy about calling customer support.<br /><br />The movie itself has a good story.  The characters could be a little bit more developed for a spy movie but the plot is complicated enough to make it entertaining and watchable more than once.<br /><br />UPDATE (2013/08/01): Amazon support didn't forget about the sound issue!  I received an email from them saying that the sound was fixed.  After viewing it again, I can confirm that Amazon did in fact fix the sound problem! I'm tacking on another star.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it's very challenging yet not discouraging, I can't stop by until i complete every room, I love the mental workout.
B00B29J0I6|2.0|This is exactly the kind of game my children and I greatly enjoy! However, it is essentially made unplayable by CONSTANT amazon game circle pop-ups! I had hoped that this was a temporary glitch, but it has been a few days since we got it and it's still happening!<br />We have had lots of other games that are part of the amazon game circle, but NONE of the others have constant pop-ups in mid move.<br />It goes something like this. The objective of the game is to get Roby the robot into a box or other specified location. In order to do this, you need to remove boxes, beams, employ the force of a \\"bomb\\" box and all that. Great physics game - no doubt. You also collect stars along the way, which then unlock the following levels.<br />Simple enough!<br />But here's the problem. You start your level, you click a box ... up pops a game circle window that blocks out the entire screen, telling you that you now broke so and so many boxes and won so and so many achievements. You have to x out the achievement summary window to get back to your game.<br />By now, your move is ruined, as in more difficult levels, timing is everything and well a blacked out screen really messes with that!<br />So you do it over again, only to get the stupid window pop up over and over again, throughout the level. Even if you repeat.<br />We really like this game, but we can't really play it, and since there is no way to turn the game circle thing off or adjust it in any way, we will just delete the game.<br />It's not worth the frustration! Especially as that pop-up window serves NO purpose whatsoever. Who really needs a running tally of how many boxes they broke while trying to play a game? BTW, how many boxes you break is of NO consequence to the actual game ...<br />If you must have some kind of summary, do it at the end of the level, rather than interrupting every move!!<br />And please make it a bit more relevant than saying you broke a box, in a game where the objective is to break boxes!<br/>That's like interrupting a checkers game every time somebody touches a checkers piece and telling them how many times they now touched a checkers piece in this game. :P
B009JZTOG8|5.0|excellent version of all the fairytales as a kid, and the woman are all super heroes very empowering for girls
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|Strange and uncertain is how this album makes me feel.  Appropriate for the times we live in.  This is their darkest album yet and in my opinion it is their finest work.  The more I listen to it, the more I like it.  A must for any Boards fan or any fan of ambient/ electronica music.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Kind of hard chugging though thigh hubby h h Gibb uhh uhh uhh uhh ibjb :-( u uhh uhh u uhh uhh uhh chef j B-) bc B-) uhh B-) :(CC Thu uhh nothing chick oil pink
B00CWY76CC|4.0|decent game; you can find Internet help if you can't solve a puzzle, but you 'll need to restart the game after getting such help
B005KELW26|5.0|Had a problem receiving it but customer service did a great job fixing it and once it was received I loved it!! Great fit for my Kindle & keeps it in place for travel!
B00821OX98|3.0|I wanted to like this show because I like Noah Wyle, but just can't seem to get into it. Nothing about the story draws the viewer in IMO. The quality of HD is great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game and can be a brain teaser. I really really like this game. I would recommend it to a friend
B005OP28XS|5.0|I love the show.  Great show...very unpredictable comedy...for once.<br /><br />The writers are brilliant.  Every character is funny, the gay ones, the straight ones, the old ones and the young ones..
B007L6VR12|4.0|I liked the period of time, a good example of the way things were in 1965.  So different, funny and touching too. I know my daughter and her kids will love it too.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|What can I say? Paul Rudd is awesome, but the wife truly made this movie a fun watch. I would recommend this to everyone.
B000083E79|5.0|the name of the CD definitely doesn't lie, these are the very best songs of Cher. i love it have listened to the full album (both discs) about a dozen times since i got it. i listen to it on my way to work and my way home. Cher is a superstar for all ages. I love her. I would recommend this to any Cher fan just so you have it in your collection and to anyone looking to see if they like Cher. this has some of every stage of her career.
B006T5C5PS|3.0|It is a book for those who really need it, but some of the recommendations are off the wall. I cannot, personally, see us doing this therapy.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is a great album. Another mega hit record from the foos. i would totally recommend this to anyone who is a foo fighters fan. as soon as i got it i opened it and started listening. my 2 year old niece loves it too. she dances with it and turns the radio up. gotta love the foos!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved Author's last two books and was hoping for the same insights into Afghan society. Was not thrilled with literary style, POVs,storylines
B004O86JZ4|5.0|listening to wasting light on vinyl they way the band intended is the best ever. just the feel and the sound and the mood it puts you in. this is the best foo fighters album yet. i love every single song and i actually listen to it every night as a lullaby.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love everything about this CD...I knew I would. Michael Buble is just one of those artists that you don't even have to question...just buy it...you can't NOT love it. LOL
0345803493|5.0|As a gift for my wife, I think, was wonderful. As per comments from my wife, this is a good book, not as good as the first one, but is enough.
B005J4TLO8|5.0|This is one of those movies that breezed through theaters quickly, so you might not have heard of it.  But it is a very funny movie.  Eisenberg is OK, but McBride and Aziz steal every scene they're in.  Worth the purchase price.
0345803507|5.0|As a gift for my wife, I think, was wonderful. As per comments from my wife, this is a good book, not as good as the first one, but is enough.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really liked the story line. I also liked the way everything tied in together from one scene to another  without having to remember  to much or to long. Hate having to play with a paper and pen on stand by.
0751517089|5.0|I'm working with the future markets and in Wall Street. I always buy books about this suject. I'll recommend this book to all the stock market player.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked it even better than the first one and made me want to buy the third one. I had a hard time putting it down.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This work provides insights into human behavior that are invaluable to those working in the law enforcement field, as well as those who are trying to enhance their communication skills.  The  book provides clear, concise, and practical descriptions of those behaviors that are universal in nature and are difficult to mask.  This allows the reader to begin to develop an observational skill set that is a tremendous edge when communicating with others, especially in adversarial situations.  Well worth the time.
0955153077|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for when finding out how to start going about doing things like the pros.  I have looked at other tutorials or books about this subject but all didn't go into fundamentals and details like this book does.  I'm glad I bought it.
B006ZS4G24|5.0|This is classic legos.  They are a great product.  Helped my children leave to read instructions and then be proud of their finished product.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|As a longtime fan of the band Hanson, I have watched their career with interest since 1997. I have seen the band's highs (megafame in 1997-1998) and lows (struggling with IDJ to release their own music in 2001-2003), the successes and the struggles, the amazing accomplishments and the near-defeats. Hanson has consistently risen from the ashes of their peers with consistently great music on album after album, but the general public has written off Hanson as a one-hit wonder, a boy band with \\"no talent\\", with no catalog of work other than MMMBop and Middle of Nowhere.<br /><br />This way of thinking needs to END.<br /><br />Hanson has done nothing but release fantastic music that both they and the general public should be proud to listen to, and Hanson's latest album, ANTHEM, is no exception.<br /><br />Anthem is arguably Hanson's best work to date, full of guitar-driven, drum-pounding, piano pop/rock and soul. Each track was written by Isaac, Taylor, and Zac, no co-writers, and each brother has a large list of instruments to their credit. Listening to the first three tracks on the album is all it takes to be hooked, and before you know it the final moments of the final song will play, and you'll want to listen to it all over again.<br /><br />This album deserves to be heard, so much more than 99% of the mainstream fluff that's on contemporary radio today. Stop reading this review, buy this album, and support real music! Hanson is the real deal, and they're going to be making music long after their contemporaries have faded away into the sunset.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard or too easy. You have to think to get out of the room. I wish that there were more levels.  Wineguy
0920668364|5.0|My son is 13 now, but I still have this book on my self. I give it to all my friends when they are having their first babies. I can’t read it with out crying.
193700788X|4.0|It was a good book and it ended as I had suspected.  I really liked Sookie and I feel as I have lost a friend.  She will be missed.<br />Ms. Harris resolved all the characters that had been issued in Sookie's past and I think she did a very good job even though it did not have the ending I wanted.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is should be part of a start kit for comedy and fantasy films. It is so stupid you can’t help but laugh. Half the time it makes no sense at all, that is what makes it so funny.
B0001I561E|4.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter.  She loves it!  However, the DVD would not play on the BluRay device.  We had to play it on an older DVD player.  Otherwise, the quality was good.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|But I am bias, I love anything that is XMEN, MARVEL or DC COMICS, or Huge Jackman, I am a fan!

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It is very easy to use and quick to find anything that I type in the search box.  I use it all the time.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I've been a huge Jimi Hendrix fan since middle school.  I used to have almost all the Hendrix albums on vinyl back in the 1970's.  Many of my favorite Hendrix albums are out of print, many of them European imports - Crash Landing, War Heroes, Rainbow Bridge, In The West, etc.  Some of the newer (last 10-12 years) Hendrix album releases are pretty good, but after buying and listening to &#34;People, Hell & Angels&#34;, I was stunned at how good this album is.  Some awesome and unique versions of his most popular songs as well as some songs I had never heard before.  I love this album and highly recommend it to all Jimi Hendrix fans.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I read every one of the Sookie Stackhouse series and normally would have to pace myself to not read it non-stop.  I only hope that there is a spin off on one or more of the characters in the novels.  What a great read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game has enough challenge to keep your interest and make you want to try the next level. It's not so difficult that you'll run screaming for a cheat code. I enjoy this a lot and look forward to future levels.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|When I first heard of Equestria Girls, I thought it was gonna be another another cheap, poorly made trick by Hasbro to get more money. I have never been more wrong.<br /><br />Many bronies like myself were freaking out over nothing this whole time. This movie had such great songs, voice acting, and great action that I was shocked when I saw it. Meghan wrote this very well, staying true to the original concept of Friendship of Magic. It had enough action for the bronies, as long as some shoutouts to the bronies,but kept the girly nature for the target audience.<br /><br />Simply fantastic, you should watch it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|lots of fun and hard to stop. great time filler when waiting for appts (car, Dr, dentist, etc). it also requires a bit of logic, which is nice.
1451668945|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has another winner in her book, \\"Daddy's Gone A Hunting\\".  I absolutely could not put this book down.  I read until my eyes glazed over and then I read some more.  What a thriller!<br /><br />The story is about two sisters and their family business, which goes up in flames one night.  I really thought I would not like this book because the book description did not do it justice.  However, I was into the story from the first 5 pages.  Ms. Clark keeps you guessing until the end and even at the end I was surprised.  Don't read ahead though, because you will spoil it for yourself.  I have a tendency to do that when I am not caught up in the story as much.  Believe me; I was so glad that I held on to my patience while reading this novel.<br /><br />I was sent this hardbound book from the publisher, Simon and Schuster, and from Night Owl Reviews for my honest review.<br /><br />You can find this review on my blog at http://wp.me/p2pjIt-6k.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|We are ready for more rooms... Bring it on.  Kids and adults both like it in o it household. So we are definitely waiting for more rooms

160941392X|5.0|This book is a great read.  Starts out a little slow but then picks up to the point of not putting it down.  You just have to keep reading to see what is going to happen.  You won't be disappointed.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Awesome fun! I lose track of Time playing this game. Unlocking the suits is cool. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with a kindle.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I loved this book! Not only is it funny and interesting with unique subject matter, but it will also really touch your heart. The writing is good, and the characters are so quirky that you will love them. I highly recommend this one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game, however, I cant get past level 7. Can someone tell me what to do or something! Ill check the reveiws every day too! Just cant get past it!
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I play this on both my iphone and kindle, and this game as trouble syncing back and forth. And on both my devices the game is not nearly as sensitive to touch as it needs to be. And this is a real problem on the code red mini game. All and all, this game needs work.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|TRUTH BE TOLD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, I MEAN I'M SPEACHLESS BUT IN A GREAT WAY. WE SABBATH FANS HELD OUT FOREVER IN HOPES THAT THIS DAY WOULD COME AND BOY WHEN IT DID IT CAME OUT HARD , LET THERE BE NO DOUBT !!  THIS IS CLASSIC SABBATH FROM THE FIRST TRACK ALL THE WAY TO THE LAST TRACK ON THE DELUXE VERSION. I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS ISN'T A ONE AND DONE RELEASE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY COULD KEEP THIS GOING FOR ANOTHER 5YRS. OR BETTER. GET THIS ONE BOYS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPONINTED. THANKS SABBATH !!!!
1592407889|2.0|Shirley said this book was \\"..mostly fiction...\\".  Since she doesn't come off well it's understandable that she doesn't give it a thumbs up.  Nonetheless...there's something slightly wierd about her daughter.  From her photos she's trying to be a duplicate of her mother!  The daughter hasn't made a big success of acting but she continues to shoulder on. She may well have exaggerated the interactions with her parents, but if only half of the accounts are true it's was surely a rough life .  The father was a thief/con man and the mother... an actress.  The book made me feel sad, even though it had the expected uplifting ending.  It's not really worth it unless you're a Maclaine groupie.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart is my favorite musician, and I've eagerly awaited this release.  I am not disappointed!  It's the same musical quality I've come to expect from him.  The style is all his - new music, new songs, but they fit right in with his old stuff.  The sound is new, yet familiar.  I'm smitten.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is absolutely the best mini series I have every watched.  I would highly recommend this series.  You would no be disappointed.
B008383GE8|4.0|Starts of well structured and is informative, however, bogs down with same arguments or points by about two thirds into the book (almost like fluff to fill the book).<br /><br />Still, worth while reading overall.
B000JQTWPO|5.0|Downloaded quickly with no problems.  Recommend both book and seller to anyone looking for a Kindle book to while away the hours.  How convenient to have a modern electronic form for books - great for waiting rooms!  Very entertaining reading.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I loving it  play spider everyday at lunch and can finish a few games on break. The first game of choice.
0062213423|5.0|Arrived quickly, even though I ordered it very close to Christmas.  Packaged well and arrived undamaged.  Could recommend both product and seller to anyone.  My granddaughter is a big fan and was so excited to get this book. Full of great 1D stuff, this book could be recommended to all 1D fans.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cannot wait till the 4th. I see everybody writing negative feedback. It's not a trilogy that's why it ended the way it did. There is still a fourth.... I've read the 1st 2 books twice just waiting for the 3rd because I didn't want it to end. And I'll most likely keep doing that till the 4th.
B007T9UIMA|1.0|Unfortunately, it was not in stock so didn't arrive.  My granddaughter was greatly disappointed.  However, I'm sure it's a video the kids love.  Maybe I'll reorder.
1476733953|5.0|Finally, a new author with a post-apocalyptic vision that doesn't include zombies!<br /><br />Wool is exceptional in every way. Wonderfully well-developed and likable characters combined with a very compelling and unpredictable plot made this book very hard to put down. Even when I finally managed to put down my Kindle, I was still thinking about the Silo and the people who inhabit it.<br /><br />I've already purchased the \\"Shift\\" omnibus and pre-ordered \\"Dust\\", but I'm going to pace myself and read a few other books between each one so that the Silo experience will last a bit longer.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game that is challenging enough to make you think yet easy enough that you keep going when you get stuck because you know you will eventually be able to solve the level you are on and be able to move on.
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|It was a poorly written script.  The characters were very cliched and did not behave as you would expect.  We slogged through the whole thing and the last 12 minutes were fun, but everything up to that point was painful.  There were lots of opportunities to expand on minor triumphs or a slow evolution of the singing group, individual minor character development.  Instead they had one scene at the very end where the group leadership changes, singing and - end of movie.  A lot could be thrown out too - the mean roommate, the bizarre throwing up, the older singing group and fight scene.  I normally have better luck after reading other peoples reviews and checking with rottentomatoes, but this was a mistake.
B002RKS81O|5.0|Downloaded quickly with no problems.  Gladly recommend both book and seller to anyone looking for a Kindle volume to while away the hours. Love to read it while I'm in a waiting room or just have time on my hands.  Great way to spend an afternoon - lounging on the sofa with a great classic novel that's so full of delightful victorian characters. Who wouldn't love that?
B008220C38|5.0|If you want another love story then watch Love Story. If you want to watch Anna Karenina, then there are a half dozen other movies that retell the sad tail in typical style. If you want to be visually engaged where the staging, costumes, lighting, etc are forefront and often exquisitely done, then this version is for you.<br /><br />My guess is that the majority of bad reviews are because people like the same old thing, retold the same old way, with little tweaks here and there. Yes, this version may be at times disorienting, because the visuals and staging compete with the story - as though they were a character themselves.<br /><br />This is the kind of film you can put on pause in many places just to look at imagery... forget that a story is going on... and that is an achievement worth 5 stars.<br /><br />Admittedly however... If you're a literal type don't bother.

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I just don't think there is a middle ground here.  Also if your trying to recapture the feeling you had when you first watched the original you'll be very disappointed. For example, my kids seem to love the movie because they're not attached to the original.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I don't think too many guys will like this movie.  In reality Babs made it as good as it was.  It was cute, but not incredibly funny.  The ending had an interesting twist.  I was personally not happy with Seth's acting, but the movie was good to watch once.  I wouldn't go for two.

B00CT2P6VA|3.0|I have both previous Quell games and absolutely love them, so I was very excited to see that Quell Memento was available.  I purchased and installed it on my Nexus S 4G.  It opened and ran, I was able to play for a little bit, and then my phone crashed.  I could not exit the program, the screen was unresponsive, and the music kept playing.  The only way out was to do a hard reboot and remove the battery.  The other Quell games run fine on my phone, with no issues.  I'm disappointed that I paid money for this and it is unusable.
B00127RAJY|1.0|It seemed like a compact cardio workout and I liked it and thought it could help me, UNTIL.....I fell and tore a muscle in my back and now, 8 weeks later, I am just starting to feel better, even after a doctor's visit and meds. The problem is that you have to be up doing exercises and then immediately to the mat and then back up and then immediately back to the mat and I fell.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story which held my interest all the way through.  Disappointed in the acknowledgements when the author basically said he made it all up with little or no research.  I know, what do you expect, but it felt that it was just a money maker with no real heart.  Just me, but that's what came across.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Better than the first two games.  Still zen like but with fresh twists. I am savoring each level. Excellent game for an excellent price.  Keep up the great work.

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I just got this set and have been amazed at how good it looks. I already owned the standard def DVD sets but decided to splurge on the Blu-ray set and I'm very glad I did. I especially enjoyed the extra on how they remastered these episodes from the original negatives and even re-recorded the opening theme music using the original score and instrumentation. I'm only on the first season, so there are bound to be other little gems along the way and I look forward to checking them out as well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the puzzle game I have been searching for. The clues (when I have need for them) are satisfactory in so far as focusing me on the immediate task at hand. Not to vague; not too revealing.
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|I was entertained. It was as forgivable for it's many logistical faults as any decent time travel movie could be, but...kind of forgettable. Just a movie. Not terrible enough to laugh at, not good enough to really stick out. I was entertained while watching it and will probably forget about it years from now. Kind of a middle of the road, entertaining, acceptable movie with interesting basic ideas.<br /><br />P.S. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's makeup was not nearly as distracting as I thought it would be and actually really helped me see him as a young Bruce Willis. You could tell JGL really spent time working on the slight facial movements that are signatures of Bruce Willis' acting. Pretty good character acting on his part. Bruce Willis' long black hairpiece around the \\"Year 23\\" mark was a lot more distracting.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I just started playing this and really like it. It's fun and relaxing. I love the bright colors and I'm sure that as I go up in levels it will challenge me.
1616550414|5.0|The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was &#34;Wow! This book is bigger and heavier than I thought it would be!&#34; Once I got past that, the book was a great read for Zelda fans (of which I am one) If you've ever wondered the history of The Legend of Zelda, wonder no more! This is a great reference guide for fans as well as newcomers to the series. Great read!
B004SIP9U6|5.0|Apart from the historical inaccuracies that have been pointed out elsewhere, this is a wonderful film with a great script.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I wasn't going to read this book because I have been following Sheryl's career and speeches for the last few years so thought I had already heard everything, but I'm glad I did.  It is a great source of strength and helpful tips as I navigate each day as a working mom.  I will refer back to it often when I doubt myself or feel like I can't do it!  I am one of very few women partners in my industry (private equity) and I have always tried to lean in and inspire other women to do the same.  It's not easy and at times I get discouraged at the slow progress but I do believe that we are moving forward.  I'm so glad that someone of Sheryl's stature has brought these issues to the forefront.
0446556750|5.0|I have just finished The Reversal and I must say, I loved it.  I am really enjoying the Mickey Haller legal thriller series.  Normally I find courtroom novels duller than dishwater, but Connelly is so good at making Mickey come alive for me, I really enjoy these books and The Reversal did not disappoint.  The inclusion of Harry Bosch in this novel was great.  I will not summarise the plot as plenty of reviewers have already done a sterling job on that, but suffice to say the storyline was excellent, I did not see the ending coming at all and it kept me guessing right the way through.  Five stars from me!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|When I am wrong I admit it. Django, if you like Tarantino's earlier work, is pretty good. He actually made a movie this time. Consistent tone, well shot, great soundtrack, solid story, and really good performances by every main actor. Yes, the violence was excessive and graphic, but at least this time it was story driven and not just \\"Hey! I'm Quentin Tarantino! I bet THIS would look neato on the big screen!\\". I guess I'll have crow for lunch. Crow is high in protein, right?
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Life of Pi is a masterpiece! It features very beautiful special effects, a very touching and not some short story and fully-evolved stories of different characters. When I saw the trailer I did not think they would deliver it to the movie. I thought one thing or another would be wrong with it. I was wrong. It's a very emotional movie and animal lovers must see it! I hope you will learn something out of it! It's a wise movie!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The book has a lot of hot and steamy sex, and it feels a little like a 50 shades rip off, except the characters are seriously flawed.  I mean, very, seriously, flawed.  I'm all for the &#34;good&#34; bad guy, but as I continue in the series - and yes, I can't seem to help myself, I find that I can put the book down, and that it is days before I find myself tempted to read more.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very useful to keep up to date especially for any watches and warnings in your area.  I like using the radar map when an especially bad storm is coming our way.  You can see with fairly good accuracy if you are in the path of the worst weather.  The forecasts are very good.
0399162097|5.0|\\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\\" is a complex, satisfying novel that starts with one central question, \\"What happens to a child who is raised as a twin sister to a chimpanzee?\\"<br /><br />I was fascinated by the questions raised by the book, and in general, I was glued to the page.  Rosemary Cooke is that enthralling literary creation with an original and engaging voice, who understands the irony of that literary voice: she understands the language of psychology and of literary and aesthetic theory, and understands that a story is more than a string of occurrences; it can be manipulated by its \\"diegesis\\" [her word], by the telling of the story.<br /><br />Hers is also a story about control: her father's control of a scientific experiment which perhaps never should have taken place, his loss of control to the greater forces of nature, her older brother Lowell's severe and personal response to the unravelling of their family (when their chimpanzee sister Fern is given away), the introduction of characters into Rosemary's college life (especially a wild-at-heart student named Harlow) who sabotage her careful suppression of personal history, and, most of all, Rosemary's control in the telling of the story.  The story proceeds episodically, through memories, flashbacks, careful withholding and releasing of crucial details, with contributions from parents, graduate students, the appearance of crucial characters at crucial moments.<br /><br />The strengths of the book:<br /><br />1) Fowler's choice to tell the story from Rosemary's point of view.  Rosemary is an infuriating, imprecise, vague, yet compelling and sympathetic narrator.  The reader may get irritated with her inertia.  When she is implicated in crimes she does not commit, she often becomes paralyzed.  However, one of the subtle themes of the story is the inability to protest, the elusiveness of language.  Fern is taught to sign, but even at a young age, there are words and thoughts that Rosemary could convey, which Fern could not.  The strength of the novel is Fowler's ability to bring to the fore all the ambiguities and elisions of the story, without losing its emotional impact.<br /><br />2) The richness of the characters.  Each character is original, with compelling motivations, descriptions, strengths and weaknesses.  They will stay in your mind for a long time.<br /><br />3) The distilling of large moral and ethical quandaries into the personal.  I felt like the novel's force was akin to poetry, in that small, personal problems demonstrated, with an imprecise and charming tenderness, the larger ethical dilemmas.  The downside is that scientific facts tend to intrude on the narrative and break the tone of the story.<br /><br />Beside the central question, many tangential questions arise.  These include:<br /><br />1) What justifies a scientist doing this kind of experiment on his family, even if the rest of the members are agreeable---scientific progress?  Better understanding of the human learning potential? Better understanding of animal learning potential?  Responsibility to a job, or to graduate students?<br /><br />2) Trauma invariably alters memory, but can reality be retrieved, and if it can, what is its worth?  Is there solace in finding out about the past, if it means reliving the pain for other members of the family?<br /><br />3) What is human responsibility to the animal world?  Does it diminish with decreasing relationship to humans?  Since chimpanzees are the closest relatives to us, it seems natural to feel more kinship to chimps and other mammals than to, for instance, reptiles.  But the animal kingdom is a natural balance of predator and prey.  We can all become vegans, but simply by existing, we impart a cost to earth and our environment.  Should we live in tents?  Should we eat only food we grow ourselves?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely, as you can see.  Do I have a criticism?  I don't love the title.  But I hope many, many othersread this book and share my enthusiasm.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Each lvl is a new puzzle with individual creativity to find different clues. Keeps your mind thinking and remembering different clues.
B0091REZMW|4.0|for a time filler the game is good. the energy is limited so you cannot play the game continually without waiting for your energy to reload or buy meals for diamonds and diamonds for money. and Irs limited in the options but the seek and find part is good.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very entertaining! Awesome cast! The characters are really easy to relate to and the storyline is very interesting. I was hooked after the first episode. I don't watch much TV but I never miss Falling Skies.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but good. Some better instruction at the beginning would be nice. It does keep you guessing, which is nice.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I feel I need to write another review of this album now that it has grown on me for a while. It's a very VERY good album. But then again what else can you expect from Tony Iommi. I mention him specifically because he's always been Black Sabbath even when all the other members haven't. I think a lot of people were spectacle about this semi reunion for different reasons. One being the fact that they wrote songs on their first reunion and it didn't really work although they were very good songs. Another is the overall direction they decided to go into this time around with their first record in mind. And last but not least the very reason in my opinion why I give this review four stars instead of five is simply due to the absence of their original drummer Bill Ward. Other than that I must say this is yet another EXCELLENT album by the band and I have to add that my biggest concern overall was whether or not it was going to sound like an Ozzy album and I must say it really doesn't. Just do what I did and let it grow on you for a bit. You'll be glad you did. Enjoy!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Eureka is the perfect show if you love science and still have the curiosity of a kid. There is always a new gadget in each episode that you wish it existed in real life. The characters are well developed and their interactions are dynamic and fun. The episodes have nice twists and turns, and, although each episode focuses on a specific event, there are several story lines that transcend episodes and even seasons. Very cool show overall!

B009R659L8|3.0|I enjoyed the story but it is not at the same level that I have found previous books by this author,.I continued to read until the end but it was not the type of book that I felt I couldn't put down. It took me a couple weeks to get through it which is very unusual for me.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I rated this game 3 stars because it is just average. The levels are easy and interesting, but it lacks the fun of other hidden object games.

B004GHNIRK|2.0|I didn't realize I was downloading the unabridged version. The story line is great, but I prefer the short version.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could not put this book down! It was such a fun read, and had many surprises throughout. I disagree with others about the ending- I thought the ending fit perfectly with the rest of the book.

B00D3XAA4M|3.0|And I know what you're not supposed to do with gift-horses. But it's basically a list of attractive destinations, with a few lines about what you'll see there, and &#34;for more information see......&#34;<br />So it's a plug for their other books - nothing wrong with that. I glanced over it, and deleted it.<br />And in general the Lonely Planet books offer plenty of detail, and a lot of info' on stuff that's off the beaten track.

B000FC1192|5.0|This is such a good book!  It is an excellent read-a-loud and it touches on various themes that are thought provoking.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I read this book when it first came out in the 70's, and when I saw it as a Daily Deal for the Kindle I had to get it. A collision of two ways of life that led to one being obliterated, to fulfill the &#34;Manifest Destiny&#34; of the other. Not our finest hour. When we pontificate about human-rights abuses and ethnic-cleansing elsewhere, we would do well to reflect on our own not too distant past. The Massacre at Wounded Knee was in 1890. Others, like Sand Creek are all but forgotten.

B009POCG5Y|5.0|and much more than that.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays an aging professional scout for the major league team, the Atlanta Braves. Unlike Moneyball's firm adherence to computers and stats as determining talent, Eastwood has nothing but disdain for computers and the &#34;interweb&#34;. Scouts looking at ballplayers, he believes, is what drives this game. On a personal level he finds old age and regret to create problems with him physically with his vision and paternally with his daughter-played brilliantly by Amy Adams. There is a lot of stuff in here for the hardcore baseball fan and the director manages to beautifully capture the sights and sounds of what Cal Ripken once defined, as the great american game.<br />Spoiler alert.<br />At the end, Clint walks out of the ballpark, cigar in hand, growling. Albeit a much better exit from the acting stage than his hail of bullets kamikaze ploy in Gran Torino.

B00BI5IXL4|3.0|It's disappointing compared to the stage version.  Russell Crow is horribly disappointing, Hugh Jackman really messes up Bring Him Home.  However, Anne Hathaway is phenomenal as Fantine.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|The interesting thing is the way Twilight Sparkle stays in the memory, taking on the dimensions of a real, tortured person. Most thrillers use interchangeable characters, and most pony movies are more interested in action than personality, but \\"Equestria Girls\\" is one of those special movies, like \\"The Godfather,\\" that is willing to take a flawed, evil pony and allow her to be human. Maybe it's no coincidence that Twilight Sparkle is played by Tara Strong, the same actor who played Michael Corleone.<br /><br />Twilight Sparkle is a punk from Ponyville. The opening scene of the movie informs us that when Ponyville refugees were allowed to come to America in 1981, Princess Celestia had her own little private revenge -- and cleaned out his prison cells, sending us criminals along with his weary and huddled masses. We see Twilight Sparkle trying to bluff her way through an interrogation by US federal agents, and that's basically what she'll do for the whole movie: bluff. She has no real character and no real courage, although for a short time cocaine gives her the illusion of both.<br /><br />\\"Equestria Girls\\" takes its title from the 1932 Howard Hawks movie, which was inspired by the career of Al Capone. That Hawks film was the most violent gangster film of its time, and this 2013 film by Jayson Thiessen also has been surrounded by a controversy over its violence, but in both movies the violence grows out of the lives of the characters; it isn't used for thrills but for a sort of harrowing lesson about self-destruction. Both movies are about the rise and fall of a pony, and they both make much of the hero's neurotic obsession with her  sister, but the 1983 \\"Equestria Girls\\" isn't a remake, and it owes more to \\"The Godfather\\" than to Hawks.<br /><br />That's because it sees its criminal so clearly as a person with a popular product to sell, working in a society that wants to buy. In the old days it was booze. For the Corleones, it was gambling and prostitution. Now it's cocaine. The message for the dealer remains the same: Only a fool gets hooked on his own goods. For Twilight Sparkle, the choices seem simple at first. She can work hard, be honest and make a humble wage as a dishwasher. Or she can work for organized crime, make herself more vicious than her competitors and get the big cars, the beautiful women and the boot-licking attention from nightclub doormen. She doesn't wash many dishes.<br /><br />As Twilight Sparkle works her way into the south Florida illegal drug trade, the movie observes her with almost anthropological detachment. This isn't one of those movies where the characters all come with labels attached (\\"boss,\\" \\"lieutenant,\\" \\"hit man\\") and behave exactly as we expect them to. Thiessen and his writer, Meghan McCarthy, have created a gallery of specific individuals, and one of the fascinations of the movie is that we aren't watching crime-movie clich&eacute;s, we're watching people who are criminals.<br /><br />Tara Strong does not make Twilight Sparkle into a sympathetic character, but she does make her into somebody we can identify with, in a horrified way, if only because of her perfectly understandable motivations. Wouldn't we all like to be rich and powerful, have desirable sex partners, live in a mansion, be catered to by faithful servants -- and hardly have to work? Well, yeah, now that you mention it. Dealing drugs offers the possibility of such a lifestyle, but it also involves selling your soul.<br /><br />Twilight Sparkle gets it all and she loses it all. That's predictable. What is original about this movie is the attention it gives to how little Twilight Sparkle enjoys it while she has it. Two scenes are truly pathetic; in one of them, she sits in a nightclub with her blond mistress and her faithful sidekick, and she's so wiped out on cocaine that the only emotions she can really feel are impatience and boredom. In the other one, trying for a desperate transfusion of energy, she plunges his face intoa pile of cocaine and inhales as if she were a drowning woman.<br /><br />\\"Equestria Girls\\" understands this criminal personality, with its links between laziness and ruthlessness, grandiosity and low self-esteem, pipe dreams and a chronic inability to be happy. It's also an exciting crime picture, in the tradition of the 1932 movie. And, like the \\"Godfather\\" movies, it's a gallery of wonderful supporting performances: Steven Bauer as a sidekick, Michelle Pfeiffer as a woman whose need for drugs leads her from one wrong lover to another, Robert Loggia as a mob boss who isn't quite vicious enough, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Twilight Sparkle's kid sister who wants the right to self-destruct in the manner of her own choosing.<br /><br />These are the people Twilight Sparkle deserves in her life, and \\"Equestria Girls\\" is a wonderful portrait of a real louse.e of cocaine and inhales as if she were a drowning woman.<br /><br />\\"Equestria Girls\\" understands this criminal personality, with its links between laziness and ruthlessness, grandiosity and low self-esteem, pipe dreams and a chronic inability to be happy.

B00B29J0I6|4.0|game is great fun for my grandson and I to work together.  unfortunately it freezes up on level 14 of the love section.  when you try to use the bombs they do no go away.  restart and some of them work others don't.  soooo we cant go any further.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best ever game I have played Everest so u should play it now awesome lots of levels and is really addicting
B000NY12LO|5.0|Sometimes the book dragged on a bit, but overall so good! I couldn't put it down through the last couple chapters
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Kept my attention and really worked my brain. It was challenging at times but worth the effort. Just wish they had more levels.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|Hey, it's ZZ Top and it's arguably their best album. To rate it you have to review it, so there you go - it's the sound that made them famous. If you know them you love it already and if you don't know them - what rock have you been hiding under?
B001ENS0BI|5.0|Prison Break is the best television series, hands down!  I wish it was still on the air.  The writers did an excellent job with the plot, it kept me wanting more and more.  If you don't know Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scolfield, then you really don't know what you're missing!!
B008MM9630|5.0|its a fun game but you need gems to complete some tasks that cost money other than that its great
B004GYY714|4.0|good radio app for kindle fire<br /><br />I don't like anything about the Kindle fire I don't like not having access to the FREE google store for apps. I prefer the Ipad over the kindle fire any day.
B007SGM084|5.0|LOVE this trilogy. Almost wish there were more books continuing their story. There's so much more to this book than just love and sex. It's about the changes we make to ourselves in order to grow and love in our relationships.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Can't wait until  the next one.Hope it is as good as the first.One of the  best monster flicks in a long.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Fun variety of things to do battle other players ,build  different armies wind ,forest air and so on. Defend the forest and the jin against evil army. Collect items to improve army. Race for seeds. Would of given five but really hard to figure out how to add friends when no Facebook friends play also need to spend at least a little money to increase aura which you need for defense otherwise other players steal your honey and seeds.
B00C061I3K|3.0|Production values are stellar. Some of the lyrics are cringeworthy when not in the privacy of your own home. If you like Daft Punk's style, get it, but it's not going to be better than nostalgia.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|One of the few movies I've been willing to watch multiple times! Well acted, family friendly, great story line and hilarious!!!

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|i have been playing nemos reef and had gotten to level 28 however 4 treasures later i had lost all the pearls i had  earned and paid for. and that does not count the 6 treasure chests i had purposely passed on. i was so irritated i sent the game to the cloud.  and now have to start over. i cant imagine how frustrating this would be for a child.  they need to make the pearls easier to get and not take them away.  also.  by level 28 i needed.  over 80,000 algae to keep the fish producing pearls.  its a shame because it is a fun game but too costly for kids
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I love this classic so much I read it very year. Was pleasantly surprised to find it for free a couple days ago.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Interesting story about a girl from Afghanistan. Lots of jigsaw puzzle pieces about the lives of the people she encounters in life make the story difficult to follow at times. I found it quite disjointed, but enjoyed each of the long vignettes about the different people and life seasons of Pari. Surprisingly, it all comes together in the end, and makes sense.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I had the G35, which is identical in nearly all aspects, but was corded. This version sports a more forgiving headband for larger heads, and wireless connectivity, which blew my mind when I first considered it. Works in the 2.4 GHz spectrum, which means microwaves and cordless telephones can interfere, but otherwise connects well out to about 30-40 feet away. Good all range headphones, though sometimes limited in volume. Microphone works great, and it's easy to get out of the way. Feels sturdy, doesn't move on my head, and not heavier than other cans of it's type. Battery lasts about 6-8 hours on a single charge, but also has a 1 hour warning to plug it back in. Charging cord it comes with is a good 12 feet long, which gives you flexibility to continue wearing it when charging.<br /><br />Good product overall, and a great feature upgrade from the G35 surround sound headset, which I loved as well.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|I don't like tear jerkers so I've been hesitant to watch this movie. So glad I finally did. It wasn't nearly as sad as I had anticipated. Beautiful cinematography and a touching story. Interesting to learn more about WWI too.

B000FC12ZA|5.0|very enlightening - makes you take a look at your life and how different it is from the aborigines. it really makes you look inside yourself.
0810996596|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating and interesting. The interviews are short, readable and funny! Pictures are very bright,bold colors and fun to look at. I can't believe he has all that stuff in his house! Many years of collecting has allowed Kirk to share his hobby with us and I love it!
1878424319|5.0|Wonderful book, easy to read. Simple concepts that if truly understood & practiced will be life changing :) Definitely a foundational book for personal growth.
0553801473|3.0|When I first started this series, the thing that most amazed me was the sweep of emotions that it evoked in me. From the highest highs to the lowest lows. And the intense focus on the Stark/Lannister conflict meant that whenever one side was happy, the other was unhappy...and with characters on both sides to love, at least one of my favorite characters would be doing well, at any given moment.<br /><br />Well...not anymore. The 'expanding world' of the Song of Ice and Fire series means that now, with so many splintering factions, EVERYONE I love can be miserable at once. And GRR Martin's ability to keep me on my toes, seesawing between emotional extremes, has devolved into a sort of dysfunctional relationship. Somewhere around the halfway point of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, I just gave up. I realized that whatever I most anticipated in the series would be denied, that whatever I most dreaded would come to pass, and I stopped having fun.<br /><br />I feel like a dog that's been kicked too many times. I'm numb to it, desensitized. A kick from GRRM is just the status quo, and my only reaction is resigned acceptance.<br /><br />A DANCE WITH DRAGONS had maybe three moments that really made me happy or excited. While I can't count how many times I just sighed and thought, \\"Of course. Of course this terrible thing has happened.\\"<br /><br />It's still an amazing world. And a fantastically intricate plot. Stuffed with compelling characters. But what does any of that matter, if I've been trained not to care for those characters, or root for them, or hope for them?

B00AQMQBKK|5.0|It is very much like the board game, though the few differences can make a world of difference to game play. The biggest difference is that in the board game, when one investigator dies, you can replace him with a new one. In this game that doesn't happen. The investigator stays dead (or insane).<br /><br />It takes a bit to get used to because you can't see everything laid out for you, but once you remember to check each card for each time, don't be afraid to use your special powers, and pay attention to the number of elder signs you have and still need, it is really a lot like the board game. I really love it and have been playing it a lot this last week (once I understood how to play it).
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book astounded me. Sloan' s writing is crisp and aimed perfectly at my soul. As an avid bibliophile, I can safely say this I  one if my favorite books!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I have really liked this book.<br /><br />Why did you put spaces on 2 pages?<br /><br />I hope to buy the next book.
B001XUYA0W|5.0|This is a great story showing how boys grew up and how a tragedy has brought them all back together.  It shows us where certain people distrust and why and it show us why other love just because.  Well done.
0307719774|4.0|I absolutely love this journal; the questions really make you think and aren't the same boring questions in every other book similar. I was I little disappointed how small it was, and how small the lines were. I would definitely prefer a little larger version. Overall, definitely satisfied with this purchase!!! :)

B002ZG999U|5.0|I got this for my husband for Father's Day and he LOVED it!!! I did good with this movie. Men love this type and I love it too!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I got the combo pack of the blu-ray, DVD & digital copy. The case was fine, no damage to the discs inside. It's a basic case with the DVD on the left and the blu-ray on the right. You can judge the movie for yourself. I only like to review the actual product.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Another typical story from Nicholas Sparks but also this means it is usually always good and entertaining.  A safe choice
B0093ICOJ0|5.0|If you read my review of Batman; The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition), then you know what my feelings were about this animated feature.  If you haven't read that review, read it whenever and you will see how much I enjoyed what they did with this adaptation.  I want to say here that I am really impressed with every Batman animated feature or series in what Voice Director Andrea Romano does in casting the various actors to portray the Caped Crusader in the various animated situations.  As far as a lot of you may know, Kevin Conroy did the voice for the animated series and most of the features.  Bruce Greenwood has done Batman on as least 2 or 3 of the animated features.  And with this animated feature, Andrea Romano cast Peter Weller(Robocop)as the legendary Dark Knight.  All in all, these animated features are fantastic!!!!!!!

B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Interesting twists and turns that keeps your interest.  Seems to be many things we don't know in the movie but it works.  Entertaining for sure!
B00B5ACNRM|5.0|If you are into animated features and you like superheroes like Batman, then you will enjoy this animated feature.  It literally is based on the hardcover graphic novel that Frank Miller wrote and does a very good job of conveying the story that is in the graphic novel.  I will never buy any Batman comic book because I cannot stand the way various artists depict Batman in their own way.  But this movie I actually did buy the comic book series that it is based on and I didn't mind it.

B00003CXCW|5.0|It would be tempting to call Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard the best film ever made about a fading star (it certainly would be in my top five); it would also be tempting to call it the best film ever made about horrible screenwriting and moviemaking. Part of the reason why the film is great is because it's both. It is also a great film noir, working as a mystery as well as a satire and a scathing attack on Hollywood. Even some of the lesser-loved parts of the film attack the system in a harsh, cruel way that would never get by in today's industry (it barely got tolerated by peers in 1950).<br /><br />As with Wilder's earlier masterpiece Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard begins where the story ends: but instead of a man having just murdered someone, a man has been murdered, ironically dying in a swimming pool he always wanted. The man, Joe Gillis (William Holden), was in fact a screenwriter from Paramount Pictures; nobody really, just a couple of B-pictures to his credit. When we meet him, he's in financial trouble. He hasn't paid his rent for three months, and now the officials have come for his car. Desperate, he turns to his agent, his friend Artie Green, and the head of the studio; none of them would give him the amount of money he needed.<br /><br />Finally, Joe ends up in a car chase with the officials and gets a flat tire. He turns into a driveway of a mansion that looked deserted. In fact, it belonged to an old silent movie queen, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who was planning a big return with her former director, Cecil B. DeMille. Reading her awful script, Joe takes a job on patching it up in time to take it to the studio, all the while staying at her mansion, having had his rent paid and his possessions brought to the house by her servant, Max (Erich von Stroheim). Just as he begins to feel suffocated in that glamorous prison, a hopeful writer named Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) convinces Joe to write a script with her, keeping it a secret from both Norma and Max.<br /><br />I've now seen the film four times, and each time I like it more and more. Most of that, I think, has to do with the quality of the writing. It approaches a level of cynicism that no one would dare write these days. Writers these days are too safe and self-conscious. Billy Wilder did not fall into that trap. Along with fellow writer Charles Brackett (with whom he co-authored the Best Picture winner The Lost Weekend), Wilder knew no restraints, no restrictions. He wrote what he wanted, and the quality shows up on the screen. Sunset Boulevard has a miraculous screenplay, certainly one of the best ever written. Not only is the dialogue top-notch, but the characters are all superbly written: a cynic who feels he's all washed up, a gentleman whose loyalty goes beyond marriage, and a spirited young woman who has a dream of writing pictures.<br /><br />Then there's Norma Desmond. In real life, she and actress Gloria Swanson shared many of the same life events: both were actresses in the silent film era, both had several films directed by Cecil B. DeMille, and both had not made the transition to talkies well. The difference is that Swanson took the acceptance, and moved into radio and television. Norma didn't, saying, \\"We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!\\"<br /><br />Roger Ebert claimed that one could not know the history of silent film unless they know the face of Renee Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc. The same thing, I think, applies here: one does not know the history of film unless they know the face of Gloria Swanson, and more importantly, Norma Desmond. In Sunset Boulevard, she not only exemplifies a towering actress of the sound era with her booming voice, but also a silent film actress with the mystic qualities of her face. Note how in the final shot after she famously says \\"All right Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup\\", the camera slowly moves in on Swanson and she gives a look that is incredibly haunting: that of a psychotic beauty.<br /><br />Like in Casablanca, the art direction and cinematography in Sunset Boulevard are ageless. It would win an Oscar for the latter category (in the black-and-white half), and the cinematography was nominated as well. The director of photography, John F. Seitz, worked with Wilder on a number of films, and was also nominated for his work on Double Indemnity. In both films, the feel he creates is misty (it should be that way, as both are film noirs at the top of their class), whether it is the swimming pool where Joe lies dead or the house of Phyllis in the latter.<br /><br />The music by Franz Waxman is by my standards, the best film score he ever composed. It has much of the traditional film noir type music, but to get inside the psychological mind of Norma Desmond, he used a lot of styles of film scoring of the 1920s and 1930s (after all, she was a silent film star). It is a beautiful, haunting score, one of my favorites of the decade.<br /><br />In the end, Sunset Boulevard succeeds mostly because it knows no boundaries. The screenwriting is never afraid to give us another surprise, another great line of dialogue, or another cynical yet honest thought on the Hollywood system. It is amazing to this day that Academy voters had to choose between this film and All About Eve for the top prizes. In 1950, the latter was the winner. But these days, Wilder's film is generally held in higher regard as one of the top American films not just of the decade, but of all time. It is big. It's the other pictures that got small.uty.<br /><br />Like in Casablanca, the art direction and cinematography in Sunset Boulevard are ageless.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had no idea I would enjoy it as much as I did.  Most likely I will finish the next 2.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Let me play n get addicted then wont launch me more no matter what I try. Really need to fix it before they release it.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Following a man lost in a life time of grief coming to terms with his frailty, and his wife's journey is equally poignant. As he journeys he sees the good the bad and the ugly and realises he is only able to look after himself and he needs to forgive himself cos that is all there is.  Read it in as few sittings as possible to get the effect.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story has a beauty of reality that no one can fathom for they have not lived it. It's an elegant tragedy. This book has caused me joy and pain. And we all know pain demands to be felt. I love this book. One of my favorites by far. This story has an elegance that simply cannot be ignored.
B00138D1I6|5.0|this is the best music album I ever bought.  I has the theme used in Disneyland's world of color.  I love almost all the songs.
030758836X|1.0|I really disliked this book.  It is dark, displays absolutely no higher values/virtues<br />through any of the characters, and when done with it, I wished I hadn't perserved, but given up on page 180.<br /><br />Of course, this is my personal opinion, and others might find the suspense riveting.  I found Amy's twistedness boring and the fecklessness of Nick and Amy's parents rather sad.  This book left a bad taste in my mouth.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and the game works well. I am only giving it four stars because I haven't been able to get any potions or extras even with reaching three stars in a level, as I have found with other Facebook tied games this could be a limitation because it is being played on a Kindle and not a computer. If all the extras would work correctly it would get five stars. It is a very enjoyable game for free.
0316247545|4.0|I liked it, it doesn't really have so much regular followers wouldn't know, but it's good, oh and also have comments from producers and people involved so that's something nice.  Most of it is Seasons 1-3 episodes synopsis.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|To be honest at first I was torn about the game . But as I played the game I became more absorbed to continue playing. I truly hope that FireProof games continues to create critical and practical thinking games like The Room.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't have enough of this book, loved it, it was very entertaining and unexpected- I hope there are more books
B002U3CCF6|4.0|I read Gone Girl then simply had to read her first books. Like Gone Girl, it's another dysfunctional family relationship that forms the basis of a gripping tale. Flynn's heroine is exceptionally flawed and self loathing, but we root for her anyway when she reluctantly returns to her home town,and cold,distant mother, to report on the gruesome murder of two little girls. None of the locals prove happy, normal or particularly likeable. This is a town no reader would want to live in. These self absorbed characters; adeptly drawn and chillingly 'real', along with unexpected plot twists keep the reader glued. Liked it a lot, but Gone Girl is even better. Highly recommended.
0375507256|4.0|It is a challenging book to follow at first, stay with it....  well worth the read. I've only just begun!
B007THA4FI|3.0|But I don't watch soap operas on tv and I don't need to read them either.  I wonder how long Rowling was chewing on these characters....
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is the third in the series and I highly recommend it. Quell and Quell Reflect are awesome as well and Quell Memento compliments the other two. You don't need to play the other two in order to enjoy Quell Memento but I really am glad that I did. There are so many challenges and the game just keeps you thinking but it's fun and believe it or not I found the games to be very relaxing. Quell Memento will keep you interested so much that it is hard to stop. I think anyone who likes puzzles and mind games needs to download this game.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This cutter is a little awkward but with practice I was cutting very cleanly.  Good choice for crafters to purchase.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|It took me a while to appreciate this album.  As a life-long Dan Fan, I'm always looking for the \\"Big Hook\\" song, like \\"Josie\\" or \\"FM\\" with the rock-like wailing guitar riffs and bass lines. They're not here, but what is is a lot of funk, soul, blues and jazz with the typically wry, sardonic Dan comment on American society.  And you've gotta love that remake of \\"Out of the Ghetto\\" --  I never though the word \\"genius\\" could be linked to \\"cover\\" !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good game recommend getting it GET EVERY UPDATE they are all awesome.I would get this any day great for kids and adults
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I have been playing this none stop. She will keep you on your toes. I like it so much that I will try more dash games.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|One author's take on the creative process and the practice of getting things done.  Well written, there were a few chapters I didn't relate to at all, but on the whole, there were many good, challenging ideas.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book is amazing. I couldn't put it down. There is so much excitement and love and resistance. Its a forbidden love story that you will fall in love with!
B003XDXNOQ|4.0|I ususally wear a 6, these were right on the money.  I really like them, they're comfortable and the top strap keeps them on my feet.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Like the ease of use, ability to have multiple locales for weather, so you can plan trips, etc. Also, maps are excellent.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|This movie has a lot of drama and twists, but unfortunately it drags a bit. I still think it is worth watching as it does have some really good twits.
B0098460O4|5.0|I first heard Jonathan and Charlotte a week or so ago on the internet.  Hearing Jonathan INSTANTLY has you mesmerized.  I was awed, I cried and was left overwhelmed.  I HAD to find their music.  Thankfully, here it is. On Amazon.  The cd arrived Sat. but I wanted to give it my full attention so I waited until this morning.  The first song is The Prayer (the same song I heard them sing<br />on the internet) and again - it overwhelmed me.  Charlotte has a beautiful clear voice and Jonathan is simply incredible.  He will bring tears to your eyes and leave you breathless.  To me, his voice is purity in it's truest form.  Ave Maria is the 4th song and is, in a word... divine.  I do not say that lightly and I've never used that word to describe anything before.  I was telling my husband about hearing Jonathan the first time and what I said then still stands... Hearing Jonathan is like how I imagine Heaven to be.  It is so beautiful, so good, so right.<br /><br />Being this deeply and truly moved happens but once in a lifetime... if you are lucky.  No doubt their journey will be incredible and leave us in awe.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game that is extremely fun but needs some work.  I would say it is a work in progress.  It needs more items and would be nice if it had alternate dimensions like the nether or The End instead of a nether generator.  Great game though.  Oh and it also needs to spawn ores such as coal a lot more.  I created two worlds and neither one had coal even close to the surface.  My friends who play the game agree the this game could update a little more for it to be a five star game.
B0051OZ564|5.0|The message of the movie (portrayed through the main character's voice-over in the beginning and end of the flick) was a good one. I would not recommend accessing the movie through the Instant Video On Demand feature on Amazon though. I usually have good experiences with Amazon (using this website for the past 9 years), but this time I had so many problems accessing the movie, and when it finally did show up in my video library and started to play (3 hours after I purchased the movie), it was pausing during play back. Makes it hard to keep up with the story lines with the movie pausing.<br /><br />But I saw the movie in theatres from start to finish and can attest to it's worthiness of watching.

B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I have to say I was skeptical, but this app has done the job for me for several months now.<br /><br />I have a computer upstairs running Vista, and a second running Win 7. Each one can be loggeed into from my fire no matter if I'm in the back yard or the kitchen. Some of the controls took some time getting used to, but I have all my music, files & photos at my fingertips.<br /><br />Set up was easy for me - not too complicated. This version only works within the same network (mine is in my home)don't expect to log into work from this app. But it comes in handy when you just wat to look up something & you don't want to log into that other computer.<br /><br />This review was typed using Splashtop, by the way.
0451169514|4.0|I just reread this book, and I feel guilty at giving Stephen King an initial grade of 3. I must have been having a bad day when I wrote the review. Although what I said below is still valid. I think the effortof writing a 1100 pages alone deserves a 4.<br /><br />My initial review begins here.<br />Let me begin by saying, I love the concept of Stephen King's book, It, as much as any he has written. A monster, whose main name is Pennywise, devours children every 27 years to achieve eternal life returns to Derry, Maine to continue the tradition. He lives in the sewers under the city and entices children into his clutches by dressing like a clown and offering them multicolored balloons. He is also a shape shifter and can transform into various entities such as a werewolf, a mummy, etc. He can also make himself look exactly like someone his potential victim knows in order to entice them down the path of no return. There are two separate climaxes, once when the main characters are eleven, and again when they are 38. I applaud Stephen King's genius in developing this compelling and creative plot, and when I saw the cover of the book, I was delirious to read it.<br /><br />My first disappointment was finding the book had more than 1000 pages. Secondly, that it was an ensemble of seven main characters rather than one protagonist against the forces of evil, and thirdly, as one reviewer put it, the human monsters were more frightening than the real ones.<br /><br />In my view, \\"It\\" is more of a coming of age story about the trials and tribulations of seven misfit pre-teenagers who call themselves \\"The Losers\\", than it is a horror story. The seven band together to combat the forces of bullying, bigotry, obesity bashing, child abuse, wife-beating, stuttering, hypochondria, over-protective mothering and all the hardships that come along down that hard road to growing up.<br /><br />I'm not saying Pennywise does not lift his ugly head throughout the book; he does. He appears so many times to threaten The Losers with certain death; it was apparent his bark was much worse than his bite. In the backstory, King begins by telling us Pennywise has murdered many children over centuries including the younger brother of one of the magnificent seven losers. We know from the outset he is one mean SOB with no shred of remorse for the heartless acts he commits. Remember he eats children. What could be worse than that? Pennywise chases all of our heroes at one time or another throughout the book. Sometimes he is one of his shape-shifting entities and sometimes, a loved one he is impersonating, but with all of these powers, he has to enlist a school bully to do his most effective dirty work, and this oversized oaf usually only doled out a bloody nose or a broken arm, not death and dismemberment.<br /><br />This book reminds me a lot of The Stand, which also has an ensemble of characters rather than a protagonist. It also has a lot of back story about another set of misfits. In The Stand, the devil personified is called The Dark Man, and he substitutes for It's Pennywise. The Dark Man also appears regularly to shoot off his mouth about the havoc he will wield against the believers, but most of the time, his threats have no teeth and most of his many appearances simply to remind us we are reading a horror story. The Dark Man is also a shape-shifter, and he too can look like other characters and make them do his will. Is this a coincidence, or a formula at work in these two offerings.<br /><br />Stephen King has more movies and TV shows made from his books than anyone. I wonder if showing the monster's ugly face every so often can be tied to when the action breaks for a commercial.<br /><br />I did enjoy portions of the back story Steve included, particularly the bully episodes, the bigotry, and the child abuse and wife-beating, but what I really wanted to read was a horror novel.<br /><br />One reviewer insinuated Steve may have been in a stupor from an addiction when he wrote this book. I don't speculate on this, but it could explain the weird explanation of the origin of Pennywise and the bizarre ending which is probably my least favorite of any book Steve has written.<br /><br />I also found Bill's stuttering and Richie's lame impersonations annoying. The Stand also had characters with annoying traits, and others who repeated silly phrases over and over until they grinded like fingernails on a blackboard.<br /><br />This review may give you the impression I'm not a Stephen King fan, but in reality he is one of my favorite author's. When Steve is good, no one is better.<br /><br />This book is well written, and I would not rate it poorly. Many have rated it five stars, but I was truly disappointed by the ineptitude of Pennywise.<br /><br />In a horror story, a monster can lurk in the shadows to build suspense for quite awhile. He can even show himself occasionally with scary music playing in the background to foreshadow approaching doom as in Halloween. But once he shows his teeth and his fangs in an in your face confrontation, he needs to rip somebody apart to prove how tough he is and how hard it will be to defeat him. Pennywise did not display this level of ferocity to any of the main characters.<br /><br />To put this in perspective, the Alien and the Predator wiped out companies of men armed to the teeth with assault weapons. What would have happened if instead of ten matches, an inhaler, and a slingshot, one of the kids brought his Red Ryder BB gun? God help Pennywise if they all brought one.

B005LAIH54|3.0|I went to see this with my son Zen, not having seen either of the previous Clash of the Titans movies, and not expecting too much. This one tells the tale of Perseus, being pulled out of retirement by his father (Zeus, the king of the gods) to help the ailing gods, who are losing power and also betraying each other left and right (there's a certain appropriateness of that, actually - villainy born out of sheer desperation).<br /><br />There's a lot of humility and father-son bonding here that is fairly nice, and the rest of the movie is sheer action. Perseus fights a minotaur, a chimaera, some giant cyclopes and a fiery Cronos himself. Nice. Huge gaps in logic, and the general uselessness of Queen Andromeda and her armies don't entirely hinder from the enjoyment of the brainlessness of the film itself, which has a certain charm to it in the face of the Transformers-level mayhem and noise (and, of course, there is no Shia Laboeuf to be seen). Cronos gets the Galactus treatment by becoming a massive cloudy fire beast rather than a Titan that may have fathered a gang of pouty Olympians.<br /><br />Bottom line - the movie is okay. Just okay, for adults, but perfect for kids.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Fun game but it has problems when running on a Kindle Fire.  You can't see your neighbors and can't visit them or get &quot;likes&quot; on your village or receive  hearts.. That means that there are a lot of quests you can't do.  It is very discouraging.

B00439MV42|5.0|Great summary of the Back To The Future series, which was never re-visited (or sullied). Cool appearance of ZZ Top, hilarious \\"What's your name, son?\\" \\"Uhhhh... Clint Eastwood\\" scene (when my ten-year-old son saw this he said \\"Clint Eastwood... that's the guy who directed Flags Of Our Fathers and Sands Of Iwo Jima... he'd never seen a film Eastwood acts in until that point, only films he's directed).<br />The extras are good, especially the outtakes, which come with commentary so that you can understand why some shots were not used. One of them, where Biff is erased from existence in the 2015 scenes - probably because Lorraine shot him in 1990 - was not used because the audience didn't get it. They initially wanted to take the crew back to 1967, since it would be fun to show that era, but they were keen to revisit the scenes of Back To The Future II.

B00000IREA|5.0|Roger Vadim directed his then-wife Jane Fonda in a cornball sexy space-romp through the galaxy as virginal space pilot Barbarella. The film starts off with two cheezy minutes of Jane Fonda in full Barbarella gear, waking up in zero gravity, changing out of one outfit into another, flinging typography of the credits about, a weird period song strikes up, with then some lyrics: \\"Barbarella, psychedella, there's a kind of cockle shell about youuuuu...\\" Cockle shells are supposed to look sexy, right? Ha ha... The naked Barbarella gets a video call from the President of the Earth Federation:<br /><br />\\"Love.\\"<br />\\"Love.\\"<br />\\"Just a minute while I slip something on...\\"<br />\\"Don't trouble yourself, my dear. Have you ever heard of a young scientist called Duran Duran?\\"<br />...<br />\\"One day we must meet in the flesh.\\"<br /><br />A robot gives her a valve of liquid: \\"Prepare to insert nourishment.\\" Crazy, man, crazy. Barbarella gets propositioned for sex, and in an easy going way she says \\"Well, all right. But I don't see what good it will do.\\" She's felt up by bird angel Pigar, she sleeps with him, helping him recover his will to fly. An old man addresses her: \\"You are of female gender, aren't you?\\" Anita Pallenberg enters the picture: \\"Hello, Pretty Pretty.\\" Barbarella hears screaming: \\"A good many dramatic situations begin with screaming.\\" Jeez!!<br /><br />Well, the plot is silly - Barbarella is tasked with finding Duran Duran, she flies through space, crash lands on a planet (twice), she gets into one dangerous situation after another, she is saved from death on many occasions by the intervention of others. Like Kim on 24 she's basically pretty useless, gaining advantage in situations by her mere presence and little else. She meets Duran Duran, but doesn't realise it's him, fights the Evil Queen in Sogo, the city of evil (named after Sodom and Gomorrah, not the Japanese department store chain).<br /><br />Note - there are plenty of promotional shots by Jane Fonda in a variety of space outfits and suggestive poses (this one, below, is one of the tamer ones)in a variety of space outfits and suggestive poses (this one, below, is one of the tamer ones)

159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has created another unforgettable book.  It has some of the most stunning and heartbreaking lines I've ever read in any book.  It has an incredible scope, interesting characters and a great compassion for the human race.  I got this book at my local library but I'm going to have to get a copy of And The Mountains Echoed for my personal library.  After I had finished it, I came to the conclusion that one day Hosseini will win the Nobel Prize for Literature -- he's that good a writer.
0307593525|5.0|I dont have to say that everything that's written inside is a must read... so, considering the book itself: the paper quality inside is quite good and the front-back are a good hardcovers.

B008G3N71W|5.0|This is the classic structure of male domination over female submission, but unlike a story by the Marquis de Sade, where the sex is anything but consensual, in A Girl's Adventure, the actress Greta May loves nothing more than to play the roles Richard designs for her. Like a continuous bal de masque, Greta learns to enjoy everything from public nudity to sly sex on the subway.<br /><br />Whisked off to Richard's country seat, she beds down in the stable with the ponies, mucks out the barn, feeds the animals and accepts the taste of the whip and bare palm when she fails in her duties, which are never fully made clear. What Greta is learning is obedience, patience and discipline - the very qualities she needs when film director Tyler Copic spots her and offers the lead role in his new production.<br /><br />For readers who cut their teeth on Fifty Shades of Grey, this is a long way along the erotic curve and takes you to places you may never even dreamed existed. If you are ready for an adventure, Chloe Thurlow will take you all the way!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|One of the best documentaries of it's type out there featuring great music and interesting dialog. It's worth buying to watch Jimmy Page alone.

0446547654|5.0|His books all are a bit syrupy and his one is no different.  Still I always read his books because they are a nice change of pace to a lot of the mysteries and other things out there.

159463176X|5.0|I have read with great pleasure the 2 other novels of Khaled Hosseini recently. With great excitement, I have been awaiting his third novel. It was worth the wait. Besides his gift of storytelling, the setup of the book is completely different from the last two books.<br /><br />It starts out with two siblings who are really close, being seperated for financial reasons of their widowed father. He gives the daughter, Pari, away to a wealthy couple in Kabul who can't have children on their own. The two siblings, Pari and Abdullah, won't be able to see each other any more. After this first chapter of the book, it all gets mixed up, each chapter being its own short story of someone connected to one of the two siblings in some way. Each short story reveals some detail about the whereabouts of one of the two siblings over the next 6 decades, but still tells its own tale as it goes on. Tales of heartbreak, love, broken promises and family. For me, I had to put down the book after each chapter, having to let it settle in, because each story is so rich.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, but the whole book, which gets off track sometimes for really good reasons, is a masterpiece. After all, it tells a tale which takes place over a time span of 60 years. People here have been complaining about the waning end of the book. I can't agree with this. It only occured to me several hours after finishing the book what a magnificent link Mr. Hosseini has set here. If I would comment on this link, I would just spoil the novel. Read it yourself and find out, you will know it's worth it with every chapter you preceed in this novel.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Please Bruce, stop... enough already... if there had been a choice for one star and below, I would have marked that... this is lame, cringingly bad, and laughable... the villains are donned in radiation suits at Chernobyl while you and your son walk around like it's a vacation?

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|As a huge fan of the books, I too was disappointed with the selection of Tom Cruise to play Jack Reacher. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Cruise's portrayal of Jack Reacher. The style and pace seemed very true to the books. The Blu-ray documentaries were informative but pretty bland. It was interesting to see how close Lee Child was to the production and how he felt about the film's faithfulness to the book. I didn't listen to the commentaries but it would have been nice to hear in the documentaries why the title was changed from One Shot to Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Bottom line: fun film. Fans of the books should not get hung up on Tom Cruise playing the title character.
3937406328|5.0|Love every bit of this collection. Chris Rea has the perfect voice for the genre of slide guitar.

B008JFUPLC|5.0|The first thing I can say about this film is that I was smiling all the way through.  Although it is many years since I went to college, this one really hits the mark.  It works so well because it avoids many of the usual teenager cliches and actually attempts to view the experience as it is really \\"felt\\" by the characters.  Another \\"plus\\" for me is that the University itself is based upon the University of California at Berkeley.  Because here I went to law school and my offices are nearby, all brings back good memories.<br /><br />Despite the many interesting monster characters, three stand out.  Mike is the student who everyone picks on. His success depends on applying himself every day for school through hard work and study. Obviously, he does not have the look of a \\"scarer\\" and thus has to work harder (and smarter) than everyone else. (Students who are a little \\"different\\" from their fellows will definitely relate to him).  \\"Sully\\" is the jock in the class, a true monster with natural talent but he cares little for actual studying. It's likely he was admitted to university because his dad was a famous student. When Mike and Sully eventually become roommates, they seem a mismatched pair...who don't even like each other.  But they learn and grow and find ways to respect the other.  \\"Dean Hardscrabble\\" is the tough teacher who thinks neither of them have the \\"right stuff\\" to succeed and, boy, is she frightening in her own way. Helen Mirren injects real menace to her voice as a caterpillar/dragon figure. (Don't forget the librarian - who has some surprises of her own).  Every college student encounters at least one tough and mean professor - think Dr. Charles Kingsfield of the \\"Paper Chase\\".  The students at Monsters University must figure out how to survive under such an intimidating teacher. Mike Wazowsky plans on winning the annual scare contest to prove himself worthy. But...he has to assemble a team - including Sully - to win.  The problem is that most of theteam members are weak...so each has to improve. Few cartoons make you care about the characters as people...this one truly succeeds in that department. Truly, Pixar's most impressive achievement with this feature is that the team developed true-to-life personalities for the ostensible monsters. That's why I prefer this prequel to the original.  Perhaps not as clever, but more down to earth.<br /><br />Another \\"plus\\" for the film is the attention to detail such as recreating the real look of a dorm room: The cheap desks, the posters on the wall, the bunkbeds, the claustrophobic feel of those rooms.  On the lawn, characters throw frisbees, the library is daunting, the celebration party in the fraternity illustrates the fun of the madness.  All the animators paid a lot of attention to their own experiences to make a college look right.<br /><br />Like many Pixar films - the humor is directed at the young, teenagers, and the mature - so there are connections for everyone.  Yes, this is a perfect family film and one of the best Pixar offerings in years.  I hope it finds a large audience. The ending is quite astonishing...with intriguing lessons for the viewers...but to reveal it might spoil the importance of seeing the film.
0446572985|5.0|Baldacci has a style that keeps you glued to the pages until you are finished.  The reader needs to read &#34;The Hit&#34;  because these two books are like a pair.  One of my favorites so far from an author I always read.
B00004SCX6|4.0|It was a great product! Although the cd case was broken & I needed tape to tape it back in, the CD had no scratches & played like new. Thanks!
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|After reading all of the positive reviews on this stablizer I took a chance and purchased it. I watch videos on how simliar it was to the merlin and the quality of the build. In my opinion this product does not come close to the merlin. The base plate is well put together but the screws that help you balance your camera were terrible! The gimble feels weak and cheap. At first I thought i had to much weight on it so I mounted a Canon Rebel T2i with a 50mm just to try to balance it. This is probably the lightest camera on the market and still could not get it to balance. I rented a merlin and a Glidecam 2000. DAY AND NIGHT! So I do not recommend this product. In this situation you get what you pay for and its a marked low for a reason.
B000000993|5.0|Probably the best, IMO... but it arrived exactly as specified and works great. Just wish Tool could get over their fear of digital downloading. I purchased it to get a clean version of the album, not somebodies rushed rip. But, none the less, quality service, speedy and works great.
B0013TTK9E|5.0|I love Amanda Grange's works getting into the heads' of our favorite love's.  I wish she had more! so much fun.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Good app fun and keeps you busy for ages and makes you use your brain,but not not good for someone who is not really patient
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Well... I really really enjoyed the book, Pam has a great sense of humour and a truly believe everything she wrights about in my heart of hearts, I think u have to really open your mind throughout this read, one of the experiments didn't work on the time frame but I think I manifested it not 2, because of holding onto grief and sadness so I repelled the goodness.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is both addicting and challenging. The levels become more complex as you go up. A lot of fun.
193700788X|2.0|If you've never read any of the books it really is an amazing world to visit, but just be prepared for things to not end the way you want them to...and keep an extremely open mind to make the ending more palatable.<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />I knew there was little chance of Sookie ending up with Eric Northman (yes, I am one of those fans), but I was very disappointed with the way Charlaine ended things.  She didn't do Eric justice (he was such an amazingly written character he deserved to go out better), the plot was just ridiculous, and the sparks ended between Sookie and Sam many books ago - she should have throw a little kindling here or there.  I liked Sam in the beginning and thought they were going to get together a couple of times, but it has been so long since Sookie has felt absolutely anything for him past friendship that it was too hard to believe.<br /><br />I just wish she had written a stronger ending to her much loved series.
145210655X|5.0|It's made well for children and has fun illustration.  There is the right amount of text on each page to be read out loud.  There are even a few jokes for the adults too!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I don't know what everyone is talking about this is a great game downloaded without a problem on my kindle Fire. Just hate that you have to have to pay extra for other levels
B006OFN0SE|2.0|The brightness/contrast was never normal at any time during the movie, which made it difficult to watch.  Secondly, the content was very disappointing for a Clint Eastwood production.  I stopped watching it about halfway through, and then traded it in at Amazon.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Using this along with a 64GB SD Card and expanded my laptop storage without having to replace the HDD.  Not as fast as an HDD, but plenty fast enough for storing audio/video media.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Belong to a book club and this was my choice.<br /><br />I found it very interesting being told through the eyes of a 5 year old.  It was an unbelievable coincidence that the month this book was being read is the same month that the tree women and one child was freed from captive in Cleveland.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I love the movie, but make sure your internet connection is solid if you're renting, otherwise it will freeze up a lot.
0307887898|5.0|I'm from Chile and I have a small company who provides translations services. This book taught me how to figure out many things in my business !<br /><br />If you don't know how to start, how to develop your business and inclusive how to make your business more successful this is what you are looking for!<br /><br />Gonzalo Silva
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The morning I downloaded this book onto my Kindle, my friend called and raved about it. Her book club had just finished with it and unanimously enjoyed it. I wholeheartedly recommend this. It's realistic and down-to-earth, a little gritty, but not vulgar. My kind of book. Oh, and I learned something about attachment disorder through the main character. Well worth the read.
B008OJ291W|5.0|great updated and remixed CD by an awesome group. very good price. I highly recommend buying this and you'll fall in love with ELO all over again.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I wasn't a batman fan until I saw this movie. Now that's all I like. It has a perfect soundtrack.Amazing.
B00821OX98|4.0|Well done. Multiple well known actors & the plot is science fiction without being ridiculous. It's one of those mini-series where you can't wait to see what happens next. I just wish Amazon would quit putting some episodes on for free & charge for the rest. I already paid for a year subscription & now they want to nickel & dime me.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|This book was a good read. I liked the story itself, but I did not feel like it gave me a large backstory besides how the virus was started and how the sun flares affected the earth.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Wings Over America is one of my favourite albuns. This remastered package is incredible, full of memorabilia and valuable information about the 1976 tour and shows Paul and Wings at their best performance!
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I didn't like this album as much as a whole as Sigh No More; however, Ghost That We Knew, Broken Crown, & Below My Feet are amazing and so well written. A must buy for all Mumford fans.
B0071AKB38|5.0|I like it so much, and so easy to use, i recommend!!! nice..., I use it on my work, school...
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Very nicely done gentle comedy about an elegant British retirement home for ageing classical music performers - most of whom had been stars in their day. They enjoy singing together, playing musical instruments, and reminiscing about the old days. Into the mix reluctantly steps a former diva and opera superstar (the incomparable Maggie Smith) who's fallen on hard times and poor health, so now needs to take up residence in the home, which itself is supported mostly through donations. Her arrival stirs up old rivalries, resentments, and just plain drama when she refuses to sing in a Verdi quartet to be performed at an upcoming fundraiser. Added to the mix at the home is her one-time husband and co-star, who still smarts over her infidelity decades earlier. And who still loves her. The film carries a poignant underlying theme: that even in old age, there lies in all of us a young soul that is unchanging - and still capable of vulnerability, joy, and above all, true love.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My first experience with a game like this so I've nothing to compare it to.  All I know is that I found myself hooked and had to finish all the rooms before I could quit.  Great fun!  I'm in my 60s and a former military intelligence analyst.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game.  Look for clues everywhere and I mean everywhere.  Unlock the elevator and move on to the next puzzle I mean floor.  this version has only 10 floors so I cannot wait for an updated version to continue the adventure.  Similar to 100 floors.
B000YR3WUE|4.0|This is my favorite Band of Horses cd. It captures the very spirit of I came to love about them.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Very few movies can capture the emotions of the human spirit as memorably as 'The Shawshank Redemption' does. Based off of the book Stephen King, this film by Frank Darabont tells the story of two inmates at Shawshank State Prison (portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman), who change the lives of everyone around. The message of hope in the film is unforgettable, and it has the most satisfying conclusion in film-making history.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If I did not like it, I would say so. What more should be said? Enough of this already,ok!?!?!<br />Done!
0439813786|5.0|This was a great book. I read it and then purchased it for my 2 young girls to have when they get older. It is so neat how Brian Selznik tells the story with pictures and words. Very talented and creative. Anyone with imagination will enjoy it.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminem has gone above and beyond with Recovery. His attitude while writing and now rapping has changed from his earlier years, but this doesn't change the quality of his music whatsoever.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|\\"Man of Steel\\" is a story about more than just good guys and bad guys, like most superhero films. In fact, it's very different from Superman stories of the past. Yes, Superman is still trying to save Earth, but \\"Man of Steel\\" also tells the story behind the hero. This addition of a more personal storyline adds a more human touch to the superhero we have come to know and love through the years. \\"Man of Steel\\" is rated PG-13 for intense and violent scenes.<br /><br />KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Gerry O., age 11, says, \\"the events, the story line and amazing effects will blow your mind\\" and Anthony A., 10-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic also likes the special effects saying that Superman, \\"has cool powers such as superhuman strength, x-ray vision, ability to shoot lasers from his eyes and of course, he can fly!\\" You won't want to miss this new film after reading and watching Gerry's review below.<br /><br />\\"If you have seen the Superman films and read the comics, you will hear about this film and think to yourself - another Superman movie?! My moms are big fans of Superman so I was positive I knew what to expect. Well, I was in for a huge surprise.<br /><br />This movie is not at all like other movies about famous superheroes. It starts by showing where Superman is born on another planet and what happens to his home. It touches your heart to see what sacrifice his real parents go through in order to save his life.<br /><br />The movie shows Superman's life from a little kid to a grown man; how he has to adjust to Earth's atmosphere and learn to control his powers. Other kids think he is weird and pick on him, but his earth parents teach him to be patient and not to attract too much attention so he can grow up and fulfill his destiny. You probably would like to know what his destiny is, but you have to watch the movie to find out. The events, the storyline and amazing effects will blow your mind, especially if you get chance to see it in 3D.<br /><br />I like this film for number of reasons. The graphics and storyline are very engaging. I also think they couldn't have done a better job with the cast. The funny and courageous reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), proud warrior and real father of our famous superhero Jor-El (Russell Crowe), Clark's earth father (Kevin Costner) and a new face on the Hollywood horizon, Henry Cavill, who plays Superman.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Clark surrenders to FBI so he can save the Earth and while he is there, FBI agents observe him through a one-way mirror window. Superman has super powers so he can see through the glass. He starts making funny comments and shocks the FBI agents with his skills. But best of all is the reaction of the agents on the other side of the glass. You can see that they struggle to believe that this is real and they are also amazed and fascinated by Superman.<br /><br />I recommend this great movie to ages 10 and up. It has elements of violence and a bit of harsh language. The graphic depiction may be too intense for a younger audience. I love the film and would definitely enjoy watching it again, though it does get a little predictable in the last 15-20 minutes.\\"<br /><br />Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gerry O.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|When I first watched this version of the book, I didn't care for it. Perhaps it was the dated look and feel - but I watched it again on Amazon Prime streaming and it grew on me. I found the casting and acting well done and it felt true to the book. Overall a good watch!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is truly a pageturner I am eager to get book three :)<br />&lt;3 Suzanne Collins is a genius for creating a ting such a great book ;D
B004LFO0ME|5.0|Definitely has to be his best album. I can't say that I disliked any of his songs on this cd. I can listen to it all without the need to skip a song. Definitely worth the 5 star rating.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Excellent plot but with lots of violence.  Lots of action but makes you think also.  Well worth the watch.  It's typical Tarantino in his best style.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. I'm not sure how the movie will capture Pat's internal dialogue which is so rich and some of my favorite parts of the book. I guess I'll have to rent it and find out.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Really fun game alot like temple run. But with some cool battling and the graphics are great<br />I would recomend this game

B008DL466C|4.0|O.N.I.F.C is a pretty good album, to say the least. I definitely enjoy jamming out with it while driving down the road. :)
B0090EJ99A|4.0|You have the central plot, and then a lot of shoehorning to fit in ad-libbed shock jokes, to get that awkward Larry David effect. Almost like they found a premise, then wrote the movie as they shot it.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Her voice is great, her songs are amazing. I cant stop playing this cd and the mp3of the songs on my phone.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Glad I only rented this movie, not worth buying<br />Slow  in the beginning,  some humor, they spent more on spe ial effects then plot, acting, and dialog.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Interesting.<br />I liked the first book better. Clever writer. I still appreciate the absence of foul words. I wish more authors would leave them out.

B008Y1YK0I|4.0|What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before?  With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor.  Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character.  Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support.  Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests.  His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause.  History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only pyrrhic victories against the Turks.
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|These two awesome musicians have really created something very good. They have covered so many tunes that I would never have found on my own. There literally is not a bad song on the CD. How refreshing to hear such &#34;real&#34; quality music in these days where autotune & lip syncing rule the airwaves. Thank you guy's for bringing us this wonderful music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love it...I'm hooked.  Every time I'm on it things are different and new. I have seen so many great ideas and recipes...funny and heartwarming images...home decor tips...travel destinations. I usually end up mentioning Pinterest when talking with friends and coworkers!
B00A861QMM|3.0|This game is too easy and boring....it narrates more than anything....boring storyline..No wonder they giving it away for free..at least my money was not wasted
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It's here always when I need it, extremely easy to use. I listed my first item today with my Kindle, just hope we can have a link while we're listing for bar codes or information codes.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|I wanted to watch this after listening to Tim Robbins read it on Audible and watching the new (2013) version. Both are true to the book (perhaps more so here than the newer movie) but in different parts of the story. This version includes more of the dialog with the distraught Mr. Wilson than the new movie but also takes (to the best of my recollection) some creative license with it that I didn't care for. I enjoyed watching both movies. This one was fun because it is so old now that it was nostalgic for reasons other than being set in the 1920s.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super fun for all ages im 13 and I thought it was a fun challenge unfortunatly there is only ten levels so I finished it in a matter of hours

B004T6IBNY|4.0|I am well pleased with this particular game, though the ball does seem to favor the left side of the game, which also is the side my son ( 4 yr. old ) prefers to play. For 2 dimensional it's O.K. I am from the &#34;50's&#34; & pinball was the best we had for video games, now is near impossible to find an arcade room with real pinball.I also have several pinball games for my Kindle fire H.D. me boy loves them also. So there you have it. As I said earlier I am a product of the &#34;50's&#34; and I am continually amazed with how much & how fast technology is progressing. Truly,keep up the good work as my family, & I am pretty sure the rest of the free world is appreciative o fall you bring to the table. most sincerely; Robert A.

The fashion of the day continues to change with the times as the struggles of the townships are challenged and genders must deal with changes as well.  Season 3 brings hardship and happiness and also makes you want to shake some folks into reality!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed was a beautifully written novel consisting of many interconnected stories from differing character's viewpoints. The stories span generations, continents, and families. In the end, they are all woven together beautifully and show how certain decisions can alter the lives of many for years to come.
B003V2HWP0|2.0|A ridiculous soap opera of a plot. I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into, but I was hoping for a better developed relationship between the mother and child. The child actress was forced and stilted, and you didn't see scenes where mother and daughter truly connected. Nor did you see Louisa's attitude reform--there was only one significant discipline and growth scene but that didn't go very far. There was potential for that plot to develop--all of the mother's grand lines about learning to read and escaping the prison of womanhood--but instead they just went back to the lust plot line. And even though Louisa sees what is happening between her father and her governess, we don't see how that affects her. The fall into the ice and Sophie's rescue occurs, but it doesn't seem to enrich or expand their relationship.<br /><br />And if Louisa's just managed to read the word \\"hat,\\" how could she have suddenly read \\"To my English Daughter\\"? And what did the Charles' father add to anything? Plus, the ending was horrifying--after 10 years of caring for his wife, Charles now decides (in the heat of passion) that she probably wouldn't want to live any way? Come on.<br /><br />An annoying, unfulfilling, shallow story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a really fun and challenging app! I can't wait for more levels! And hopefully. they make more than 10, that way I don't have to wait for another update!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it makes me think<br />I reecomend this game to those who love to have a real challenge
B0060D196K|5.0|This movie rocks. Great animation, close telling of the original, conveys the soul of Dickens' story better than any other version. I'm generally not a Disney fan, but this one is very well done.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|I love this game and so does my little sister. I let her play it on my phone but I'm sick  of her always taking it from me so I tried to get it on my kindle and it was three dollars when I got it for free on apple?!?!?

B008EKOIN8|3.0|I heard the interviews on radio and was anxious to read another Pollan book.  However, while Pollan addresses an interesting topic on the transformation of food, the text is so belabored.  Cutting two-thirds of it would do.
B00CTEMQLG|5.0|The actors are all so talented! I loved the music. The characters are all very well developed- very likeable and or dis-likeable. There is enough conflict in the story to keep your interest piqued but not too much to where you become overly frustrated.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love having a readily available weather app, though the accuracy isn't 100%, the maps a great! I can even check the weather on friends & family!!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Read this book after completing the Wheel Of Time series he picked up after Robert Jordon, may he rest in peace.<br />Loved the series so far for the character's development as well as the change in the world.

142312166X|4.0|All the quests are in the middle of the Battle of the Labyrinth and The last Olympian. The first quest stars Percy Jackson, Clarisse la Rue, Deimos, Phobos, fish, arrow shooting birds, and angry crazed sea mammals. The second stars Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Charles Beckendorf, Selina Beaureguard, a bronze dragon, giant ants, and two children of Athena other than Annabeth. The third stars Percy Jackson, Thaila Grace, Nico di Angelo, Ethan Nakamura, Ipaetus, Pheresphone, Hades, snarling demons, and a mind erasing river. All of these quests have war, action, and adventure in it. I would recommend this who like hilarious and short stories, along with the action and war. I rated it a four because it was really good but there were some inconsistencies in the same series.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love it! Lots of hidden object search and good story. My granddaughter really likes it too! One of the best I've played!
B005HGKWLO|1.0|Ya know, I've had to sit through many a &#34;chick-flick&#34; over the years. Some of them actually try and take men into account, knowing they'll be suffering through a movie with a new date or a wife that puts up with sports.<br /><br />This movie doesn't do that. Nor does it entertain. In fact, I'd rather visit the DMV than watch this garbage. It's predictable, it's boring, somewhat sleazy (and not in a good way) and the acting sucks.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the guy from &#34;The Office&#34; I probably would have hung myself before the credits rolled.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Its great having my daily dose of LoL at hand, either during lunch breaks or just waiting at a stop light; jk anyways! the quality is great !
B0095P33IW|4.0|Pretty faithful to the comics, although Bucky is a bigger, older guy.  In the comics, I remembered him being more like Robin, i.e. a young, smaller guy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A mostly challenging game. Good clues that can be a little difficult to find but a fun game to play.
B00821OX98|4.0|Falling skies is an interesting take on the typical alien invasion and the resiliency of human rebels facing certain annihilation. After a horrible defeat of the worlds militaries at the hands of an advanced alien race the episodes of falling skies take place 6 months after the initial invasion. Using tactics similar to the American revolution the survivors begin to fight back against technologically superior beings.<br /><br />Season 1 sets the ground work for a television show that doesn't disappoint it's viewers by attempting to do too much at once. I highly recommend this series.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Absolutely love her CD, It keeps me optimistic during these tough times. Makes me smile n' wanna dance ! I just wish I would've found her earlier !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! If you like other Nicholas Sparks books I bet you will love this!  If you have seen the movie, it's a little bit different.  Both are great!
B004BSFC46|5.0|The gentle rattling makes this a wonderful cause and effect toy for newborns. They can go on wrists or ankles to encourage movement to create the sound!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the story, love the message, hate that the movie can't show it as brutal as it should be  (:
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Just as the movie started to build up, the quality began to constantly reload. We rent/purchase movies on Amazon fairly often, and this has never happened. It took 15 minutes just to get 5 minutes of film played. It happened again a few times throughout, but they were less severe. The movie itself, The Hobbit, was not as good as we expected. Took a while to build up, didn't seem as true to the book, but it's been 25 years, so maybe I don't remember it well. The last hour is the best.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|While we all love the subject of the Hobbit and Trilogy of the Rings, this movie was simply too draw out and slow. Even my brother who has read the book more times than can be counted became bored.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|Reminds me of being at the theater, without having to shell out 5 bucks for a Pepsi and 6 bucks for a lousy popcorn. (Let alone paying a premium price just to see the movie in 3D)
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have been a fan for some time, liked the Tron soundtrack, but i have to say this is the best thing that they have ever done. I love ever song. the throw back 70s and 80s sound with the pop and sync sound make it all come together, I was so happy that get lucky got so much air play and was a number 1 on the charts, I hope this opens up more fan for this great group who have come into ther own on this cd. love it all. great job guys.And if you have the time, go to there website, and click onto THE COLLABORATORS and see interviews with all the people who made this cd so good. and its interesting as they talk about music and others things that have brought them to daft punk. real cool. check it out if your a big fan.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Thank you for getting me the CD as promised on the day it came out.  I am always happy with my purchases on Amazon!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Pretty much what we have all come to expect from Tom Cruise. We enjoyed it and would recommend to others.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Another awesome addition to the Tarantino collection. Plot, cast, action, comedy, and story line made this movie enjoyable. I will have to buy a copy. Loved it!
B006OB3K56|5.0|This is art! The director Steve McQueen will be remembered as a giant of our generation. Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan also did their greatest performance.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|We watched this one weekend with family and then immediately gave it to our teenage nephew, so as not to keep it for our collection.
B0063IH60K|4.0|every once in a while it shows a 30 second commercial this added to the other ads gets old.  please fix this
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|i saw this movie with my 9 and 12 year old thinking it would go over their heads.<br />not so. we ended up buying the soundtrack and the movie which the entire family LOVES.<br />fyi, my husband is a professional musician who plays on broadway here in new york.<br />it is an incredibly crafted movie, based on the original show. the fact these actors all sing live is INSANE.<br />sasha and helena particular favorites. hugh jackman lives up the street from us and to think he let himself look this bad when he looks sooooo good is a testment to his calling.
B00499NHLC|5.0|High energy fun with Sherlock in this modern take on the clasic.  The show is very well written and extremely well cast.  I have enjoyed all of season 1 and can't wait for season 2!
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|We have always enjoyed pretty much everything Tom Hanks has done, so bought this one pretty much blind.. Following the stpory line was just too much. I turned it off half way through.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|What a great movie! The action, the smart-ass one liners, the fully realized witches, the fun-flakey story-line. It all worked and worked so well. This was a fun romp on a very old fairytale. Don't get too serious about anything about this movie, sit back and just enjoy. Loved it. Slam, Bam, thank you Ma'am. NEXT!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game! It really gave my brain the work out it needs. Make up more rooms soon please. Awesome.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I read this book as a teenager in school and every word was dissected.  Wonderful experience rereading as an adult and enjoyed every word this time. Powerful, timeless!
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins has ended the Hunger Games series with yet another riveting, epic, surprising, and heartbreaking book. However, the ending of Mockingjay was a bit rushed. I thought some explanations about certain events towards the end were needed. Overall it was still an excellent book.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Every time I press a video nothing happens even when I hold down on iti don't think u should get this app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really nice and time consuming. Exactly what I wanted in a challenging game. Makes your mind really think out of the box. Very nicely put game :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an addictive game. Kind of a treasure hunt and puzzle game all in one. You need to think  outside the box for this game. Only 10 levels though, would like to see more.
B000002LAC|5.0|Love the Dolly Parton. Emmylou Harris & Linda Ronstadt collaborations.  Their voices blend so well.  Any album that Dolly is on is good.
B000056HOZ|5.0|These DVDs are just what I was hoping for nd are worth every penny. Any fan of the Boss should include this set.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Thu  game is free , good , this game is fun as heck I laugh every time I die , that's the funny part so go ahead and get the hill climb app it plays well on my kindle fire hd .
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I love playing this game on king.com.  When I saw it being offered I was thrilled.  We have both the 1st generation kindle fire and the 2nd generation kindle fires and I don't understand why the app says kindle fire edition when it doesn't work on either one.  Love the game though and I hope eventually it will be compatible.
0449208109|5.0|It's a quick read and an introduction to the Igbo people and those of pre-European Africa. Chinua Achebe is a great author.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best app ever. I use it all the time it has many wonderful ideas. If you like do it yourself crafts this is the app to find great ideas on
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like the game. But it is updating. And you can't play it bummer. Really fun game .<br />FIX THAT THEN 5 STAR RAT
B000000OU0|5.0|Didn't have to go K2HD encoding to enjoy this original in my system.  Starting with the famous Hotel California, the initial guitar and bass from this recording has to be one of their best ever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It doesn't make you have to play the game fully by paying for crystals. Has pretty good graphics but energy is a limiting factor for playing the game.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I first off want to say that Sophie Kinsellas books are an instant buy for me. And when I do purchase one I plan (wish there were italics here) to read them. I curl up with a nice glass of wine or cup of tea and enjoy the suspended reality of her books. Because let's face it, there's no Pulitzer Prize winner seal on the front of them, they are almost always witty, and engaging with endearing and interesting characters..but not always exactly \\"realistic\\".<br /><br />However I was SO sad to see this book fall so flat. I wasn't distracted by the shifting voices as others mentioned. It's clear whose voice is speaking in each chapter- and if you couldn't tell, they are labeled with their names ;) But this book had such funny and endearing moments and then just abruptly stopped.<br /><br />For one, Ben turned into a total duche bag, literally overnight. I get that the author wants us to stop rooting for them as a couple but it was so abrupt I was turned off. Lottie's nievete and the way she copes with her breakup was farcical, but again..part of the books style. However, the fact that she realized the marriage was a mistake and that she still loved Richard but decided to have a \\"goodbye shag\\" was also a bit off-putting. And throughout most of the book Fliss and Lorcan have this chemistry and you root for them to build something and reach some magical moment, and in the end it's just flat as well. The end...that's it..done. No plans for the future, no talk about their hook-up and the large misunderstanding after that. Just period..turn the page...oh wait, that's the end of the book. It was very anticlimactic. Actually that's a perfect way to explain this whole book. There were funny and amazing parts that just built up to nothing.<br /><br />Quite disappointing because of how much I love this author, but I know my expectations were high to begin with so it earns a 3. Not terrible, just not wonderful (as many of her books have been). I recommend 'Can You Keep a Secret, Remember Me, and I've Got Your Number if you are new to this author. Please don't judge her by this book if its your first of hers!!
B008YKGQR4|2.0|This is slow,frequently unresponsive. Will not allow me to move pictures to a different album. Will not allow me to return to certain areas. Very disappointed!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game and makes you think. Only 4 days stars cause it Needs more levels :) can't wait to play it again once they add more!
0634049011|5.0|This is not a over night book. It takes work and time to learn but it is worth it, Once you complete this you will be able to play in any key anywhere on the neck. I wish I had found this earlier
0525478817|5.0|Seldom does one read a novel that is exactly where one is in life, but that's how THE FAULT IN OUR STARS hit me. I loved the narrator Hazel and her acceptance of where she was headed, her own death from thyroid cancer, but especially I loved the witty and lively Augustus. (John Green is having fun with us here since the title is taken from Julius Caesar and the line twisted to fit our main characters, all teen cancer survivors.)<br /><br />The Mid American setting never feels real to me, but once Gus and Hazel get their bucket wish and go to the Netherlands, the setting, characters, and story come together and dazzle the reader. I love the moment when they tour the Annex where Anne Frank hid until she and her family were arrested by the Nazis. Like Hazel and Augustus, Anne's fault was in her stars.<br /><br />Are Hazel, Augustus, and others from the group average teens? No. They're teens who have survived their first round with cancer and are living under few allusions about what happens next. They're sarcastic, witty, and well-read, or at least Hazel is. Green's adults all meld into one except Hazel's mom, who has ridden the roller coaster of her daughter's disease, so much suffering. When Mom asks Hazel the Question in ICU, \\"Are you ready?\\" The reader is one of the family and right there among them.<br /><br />To those who find fault with this book, I say the fault is in yourself and not in your stars. Thank you John Green for writing this.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|MY FIRST IMPRESSION FROM 2013: I really love the screenplays Gaiman has written for Doctor Who, two of my favorite episodes. I started reading his books. My first Gaiman book was American Gods, a classic, I know. It has a great premise, but the execution left me a bit flat. Then, I read this new book. First, I think at $12.99 for an e-book the equivalent of less than 200 pages is a bit steep. Second, I was hoping I'd enjoy it more than American Gods. However, it just didn't happen. I didn't enjoy the story at all, nor the language. Granted, the main character is a young child, but the prose just doesn't sing. And, who are these magical beings? No idea. Everything about who they might be was just too vague. I really wanted to like this book, but I guess it's just not for me.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/17/13: How times do change one's thoughts. OK. I teach writing and literature at a college in Florida. Every year a committee of my colleagues chooses a book (this year two books) that they hope all the department's faculty will use in their classes during the next Spring Term. We call the program \\"A Good Read.\\" This year, guess what? Gaiman's book is one of the two chosen novels. So, I'm here to say I'm using the book in several classes and am re-reading it in preparation for teaching it.<br /><br />And, after complaining about the $12.99 price for the Kindle edition, I notice today that the price has dropped to $7.99. That's certainly more realistic for a short novel.<br /><br />Finally, the BEST part, for \\"A Good Read,\\" we faculty get a free copy (I have no idea who actually pays for it) of the chosen books. When the mystery of the new book was revealed, we discovered that Gaiman's books, hardcover, were all AUTOGRAPHED! I love his Doctor Who scripts, so this is wonderful. I wasn't going to take a copy, seeing that I have a Kindle edition, but of course, I took one anyway. So, I'm feeling better about the book already.<br /><br />Seriously, though, I really hope I like it better the second time around. Many of my colleagues love it, so maybe I was just having a bad couple of days when I read it before. Time will tell. I'll let you know.<br /><br />MY SECOND IMPRESSION, GETTING READY TO TEACH THE BOOK: I changed the title of my review to correspond to the impression from my second reading. I have to say, that impression changed significantly. I see things in the second reading that I didn't notice in the first, possibly because I was reading too quickly. Anyway. Lots of thoughts while I am in the middle of this second reading: What is childhood? What makes someone an adult? Is life and the world as frightening for all children as it is for the novel's protagonist. As I think it about, yes, life and the great wild/wide world can be very frightening. I know it was for me. So, I think that on a second reading, I'm relating to the story in a way that I wasn't ready for during the first reading. Maybe, like me, you'll have to read it twice to get the full impact, but it is certainly worth the time. Go ahead! Read it!better the second time around. Many of my colleagues love it, so maybe I was just having a bad couple of days when I read it before. Time will tell.

B008OM0EDO|3.0|i was bored at night and there was nothing else to watch, hope on amazon and found this movies was on.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|My children have fought over who was going to play with it.  It is a smash hit in our house.  It is very reminiscent of the original Mario in may ways.  My husband even commented on the correlation to Sonic the Hedgehog.  It's nice to see something that any age player can enjoy, and relate to.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|Could just be my phone, but whenever I go to launch Fruit Ninja it just loads a black screen and does nothing from there.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|A bit gory as one would expect, but just fun action and great entertainment.  For the gore, the R rating seems appropriate.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I wanted to see this movie because I have always loved the Wizard of Oz.  To be honest I expected to be underwhelmed, but instead I was blown away.  James Franco and every character in the movie nailed their parts and I think it fleshed out the main characters in the Wizard of Oz.  I will enjoy that movie even more because I feel that I know the characters better.<br /><br />The audio and video quality of the blu ray are absolutely outstanding!
B00019074O|5.0|This Movie Is An Awesome Keystone Cops Type Movie.It Has Plenty Of Laughs And I Am A Big Steve Guttenberg Fan.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I RARELY write reviews.  This book is worth a review!  I laughed out loud and found myself reading excerpts to my husband. This writer is a breath of fresh air and I hope to see  much more from her!  Drew 's point of view was irreverent and hilarious on EVERY page of this book! This book caught my attention on page 1and never slowed down!
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game.  I really enjoy playing it daily. really works the Brian.  you should try it. I have started several friends playing this game.
B00493E1GI|5.0|This is a very good film. Julia Roberts did an awesome acting job. All the actors did very well. It was a well played out movie. I would recommend it and have already to several people.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome everyone should have this game my friend says it sucks but he's just a stupid not to be mean or anything hes still my friend
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|If you want a new story with an epic soundtrack and you don't mind the violence common to Tarentino movies, it's well worth watching. Waltz, Foxx, DiCaprio and Jackson give performances of a lifetime.
B009R659L8|5.0|Another great  book by Mary Higgins Clark. It was a good story with twists and turns and I enjoyed reading it very much.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar is a good movie,...there's just something about yellow eyes and a tail. Seven more words are required it says so Its a pretty darn good movie. I don't do 3D but this was a multi version disk and at a good price so it worked
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I gave this book five stars as it goes to the soul.  I think it should be required reading in every school.  Every student should read it or be read to.  This story helps wakes us up to what kindness really is and how it works. We should understand that no matter what one looks like they are still a person inside.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|This has easily become one of my favorite movies! Zooey Deschanel, James Franco, Natalie Portman, and Danny McBride...what's NOT to love with this cast?! I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the pipe and a good laugh!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Well, this game kept me up into the wee hours. Levels 1-4 were easy. Level 5 as where I got stuck. I had the right numbers but just could not figure it what to do to get that blue weight. Took me a while. Same with level 10 and that x. Oh my.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Needed to see first night of Hannibal as missed recording it.  Great to be able to get first episode free.
0553593714|5.0|I looked quite far down my nose at fantasy until this series. I probably still do for the most part, though  I have read more of it since reading ASOIAF. Anyways, everyone knows this book by now. No amount of hyperbole can ruin it. That's the highest praise I can give.
1451673442|5.0|This book is a workbook to getting you the tools toward creating the habit of positive thinking. You get out what you put into it.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I may not watch this again for awhile, as it is difficult to watch. Such realism of the suffering and death of our Lord. Although it is so realistic, it was much worse in real life.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Immediately read the rest of her books after, as I liked this one so much. I just wish there were more. MORE MORE MORE.
1582701709|4.0|Food for thought.... Great book, especially if you enjoy multiple authors/writers/important figures in history incorporated into one text.<br />Something worth reading if you enjoy philosophy of thought and the power of ones thoughts. Great intro book into that subject matter.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun game the only problem is it's really hard to make money and everything coats way to much. But all in all a fun game especially if you like horses
1849025975|4.0|George Orwell brings the same meticulously analytical and objective approach to reporting that he had demonstrated in The Road to Wigan Pier a year earlier to Homage to Catalonia, which describes his experiences fighting for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Like in the earlier work, Homage is divided into chapters where Orwell sets down his experiences and reactions to what is happening around him, and chapters where he steps back and tries to analyze the larger context (in Wigan Pier, these form neat and separate parts one and two, while in Homage, the chapters are intermingled).<br /><br />Wigan Pier dealt with poverty in England, and drew some uncomfortable conclusions for Orwell's sympathizers in the British socialist movement. Homage draws even harsher conclusions about the reality on the ground in Spain on the Republican side. This is not to imply that Orwell had abandoned his socialist sympathies, or even questioned them. In fact, it's pretty clear from the narrative that he remained a romantic and rather naive socialist after his Spanish experience. But he was nobody's fool, least of all the Communists' (unlike many of his contemporaries on the Western Left).<br /><br />What he was was an an increasingly excellent writer as well as totally honest reporter. His descriptions in Homage of the street scenes in Barcelona, the trenches on the Aragonian front, the feeling of being in battle and (especially) of being shot (he was wounded rather seriously in the throat) are some of the best frontline reporting I've ever read. Vivid, concrete, objective without being dry, they give the reader the feeling of truly being there.<br /><br />Homage is one of at least three notable works by major English language writers that were inspired by first-hand experiences with the Spanish Civil War. The others: Adventures of a Young Man by John Dos Passos and, of course, For Whom the Bell Tolls, by Ernest Hemingway. I will be reading (re-reading in Hemingway's case) those two books in the near future as I make my chronological way through the (English language) literature of this period and hope to post reviews at those times.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Season 2 has been spellbinding (literally). All the characters have been richly developed over time and all the performances by Robert Carlyle are amazing. Why didn't America know of this guy before now? The writing has improved greatly this season, keeping viewers wanting more. Cannot wait for season 3 to start.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|None of the trailers I saw prepared me for the gay lover scene. Killed my interest, and I turned it off. Too bad they didn't warn me, I'd have saved six bucks. I guess no way to get a refund, even though I only watched 5 minutes.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Enjoyable game a bit quick calling numbers and don't often pay out on last number don't give time to daub<br /> last number
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Compared to the Alex Cross series by James Patterson, this is my 2nd favorite author & books.  Definitely keeps your interest and you don't want to put it down.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Angry Birds Friends is a fun game and keeps me entertained for the short periods in which Ihave time to actually play.
159463176X|3.0|I went back and forth between two stars and three stars.  Finally gave this book three stars basically because Hosseini is such an incredible writer.  However, I found the story to be confusing.  It had a promising beginning and I was eager to read more but after 100 pages or so it just became disjointed.  It was as if he inserted several peripheral characters in the middle so he could begin to tie everything together for the final reunion of Pari and Abdullah.
B008KPDKAE|1.0|I was engaged and wanted to watch a movie with my bridesmaids. I should have picked a different one, because this movie wasn't funny to any of us.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The subway surfer is a good game and is really fast towards moving really fast for example when u get caught by the security it goes by quickly and it doesn't even freezes or anything so yeah this game is good it moves quickly and that is all I need to play a game so it won't get me irritated.
0345529057|1.0|It's a mystery how anyone can compare this author to Tolkien. The tediousness of this series, the complete lack of good vs. evil, the sheer number of characters as well as their wholesale slaughter and the redundancy of events left me bored and frustrated. I even ended up turning to synopsis's and summaries to wade through this muck just to see how this one will die and how that one will die and how their children will die but discovered it's not even worth finding out. The characters that manage to survive all end up having similar personalities and lose any unique voice they originated with. Everyone seems to have a weird loyalty to their family name rather than to their family members and revenge and unchecked violence to seek that revenge are the prime motivator of everything and everyone. No one is spared this general malaise.There are no heroes, no great magic and the outcome of the characters becomes incredibly repetitive with similar bad luck falling upon all in similar fashion. I keep hearing myself saying \\"oh please, not again!\\" I have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings more times than I can remember and will do so again. As for Ice and Fire? I can't even get through it once. George R. Martin is no Tolkien and never will be.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This CD is absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend it to everyone.  The music is soothing and Andrea's voice is so special.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really fun. It is challenging enough to be entertaining but not so difficult you want to throw your device. The solutions, unlike some levels on 100 floors, actually make sense, it is just a matter of time before you get it. Be sure to search each room thoroughly though because one missed number will halt progress.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Definitely worth trying. The game-play is simple enough. There's a money system that allows you to buy interesting upgrades just for playing - not that you really need them to play but they are fun. Beating your own record becomes extremely challenging which I enjoyed thoroughly.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Well, you can play. You just have to keep paying real money. There are constant challenges/quests that require the purchase of game dollars or there is just no way to move forward. Too bad because it wasn't like this before they updated it.
B00846REIS|4.0|I thought Bared to You was sharp and economically written. The writing was very well-executed, much better than most romance novels I've read of late. The complicated histories of the characters and sheer number of interesting minor characters that decorated the world all added very much to the story. I can't wait to read the next part!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I have never been captured by such brilliant writing and acting!  With so much trash TV these days, it's refreshing to have a good, well written, nighttime drama!  The next season cannot come soon enough!
B0060CXAHC|4.0|My only complaint is that they say &#34;Stupidhead&#34; in this movie. I didn't expect my son to watch this, walk up to me, kick me in the shin, and call me a &#34;stupidhead.&#34; If only I could erase the 2 seconds of the movie that included this, I would be so happy. But he has enjoyed the movie at least twice a day for the past 3 weeks.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|\\"World War Z\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: On an ordinary day, Gerry Lane and his family find their quiet drive interrupted by urban gridlock. An ex-United Nations investigator, Lane senses that this is no ordinary traffic jam. As police helicopters buzz the sky and motorcycle cops careen wildly below, the city erupts into chaos. Something is causing hordes of people to viciously attack each other - a lethal virus that is spread through a single bite, turning healthy humans into something unrecognizable, unthinking and feral. Neighbor turns on neighbor; a helpful stranger suddenly becomes a dangerous enemy. The origins of the virus are unknown, and the number of infected grows exponentially larger each day, quickly becoming a global pandemic. As the infected overwhelm the world's armies and rapidly topple its governments, Lane is forced to return to his dangerous former life to insure the safety of his family, leading a desperate worldwide search for the source of the epidemic and a means to stop its relentless spread.<br /><br />The cast led by Brad Pitt (who also produced) (as Gerry Lane) is excellent. The directing by Marc Forster is excellent. The screen story (based on the novel by Max Brooks) by Matthew Michael Carnahan (also wrote the screenplay) & J. Michael Straczynski & the screenplay by Carnahan, Drew Goddard & Damon Lindelof is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Marco Beltrami is excellent. The cinematography by Ben Seresin is excellent. The film editing by Roger Barton & Matt Chesse is excellent. The casting by Kate Dowd is excellent. The production design by Nigel Phelps is excellent. The art direction by Jon Billington, Ben Collins, James Foster, Alan Gilmore & Matthew Gray is excellent. The set decoration by Jennifer Williams, set design by Claudio Campana, set dressings by Tammie Childress is excellent. The costume design by Mayes C. Rubeo is excellent. The make-up effects design by Mark Coulier & character design by John Rosengrant isexcellent. The special effects supervised by Neil Corbould & Gabor Kiszelly, coordinated by Jalila Otky is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Matt Johnson, John Nelson, Simon Stanley-Clamp & Adam Valdez, coordinated by Nicole Duncan, Jane Ellis, Murray Gale, Jack George, Zafar Janjua, Ross Johnson, Abigail Mendoza, Simon Mills, Rebecca Scott & Mark Sum is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Simon Crane & Wade Eastwood is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent, entertaining, and fast-paced action-horror thriller that is interesting and intriguing. This is also a well-made and well-done movie, as well. This is one of the best movies in the zombie genre. Brad Pitt gives a solid performance as Gerry Lane. This is one of the best movies of the summer season.

0345529057|5.0|In book 4, there were about thirty pages in the middle of the book where the pages did not feed properly in the book binding process and so were 1 inch from the top of the rest of the pages with the last paragraph of every page cut off.  Because I read all of the books in order, I did not notice this flaw until AFTER the return cut off date.  Would love a &#34;whole&#34; volume to replace it but can't figure out on Amazon how to inform them of this.<br /><br />Otherwise, the series rocks.
B000007ODY|5.0|I had heard from a music critic that she had been in the audience in New York when the Berlin orchestra played Brahms and she was totally &#34;blown away&#34; with the music and Karajan's interpretation of the music.  The CD matched my expectations.  The quality of the sound is excellent.<br /><br />(Note: question should read, &#34;To whom would you recommend this CD&#34;, not the way it is printed. As my English professor once said, &#34;A preposition is a bad word to end a sentence with.&#34;)<br />I would recommend this CD to anyone who is serious about the quality of music.

B00CBQOEA8|3.0|OK, I am listening to this album right now, and have heard it countless times before.  The Emancipation of Mimi definitely deserves praise.  Its Mariah's freshest album in awhile, and she hasn't really been able to duplicate the success or greatness of this album since.  That being said, when compared to Music Box, Daydream, Butterfly, or any of her 90s work bar Rainbow, well there is no comparison really because her 90s work was a lot better.  That doesn't stop it from being a great album.  It has great contemporary ballads, hip hop/R&B numbers, and Mariah definitely covers many different musical territories with this album.  Its something she doesn't always do, and she ends up being stagnant on many of her albums, so its nice to hear her sound so diverse on The Emancipation of Mimi.  Another cool thing is she keeps the rappers to a minimum, and the tracks that do contain rappers are very melodic, similar to how she incorporated hip hop unto her Butterfly album really.  If Carey manages to create another album as fresh and diverse as this again, it would be excellent.  I don't see her going back to her 90s greatness, although that would be a dream come true.  I'll settle for an album as good as TEOM.

1607066017|5.0|Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples do an amazing job fleshing out an enthralling new world. The characters were amazing, and I cared about all of their story arcs. The art was delightfully weird, and I would keep turning the pages just to see what I would be seeing next. The romance between Alana and Marco is very well done and keeps your interest as you settle into knowing the Saga universe, but by the end, you are invested in all of it and you just want to see more!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I have been meaning to watch this movie for a long time.  What held me back is that most of the people would describe this film as a story about one man's fight with his addiction(s) to alchohol and drugs.  Once I saw the film, I found that for me personally, this movie is far more than that.  It is a story about a man with intelligence and talent.  As successful as he is in his profession, his personal life is in shambles.  He cares about his personal life, his marriage, his wife and child, but it seems that differences and divisions are so deeply seated between all of them that reconciliation of any kind is impossible.  Any human being can identify with the pain of loosing someone we love dearly and not being able to do anything about making things right again.  Everything seems to get in a way: job, family members, cruelties of everyday life itself.  And when pain becomes unbearable, people turn to ways of making that emotional pain more managable.<br /><br />This particular story is a a story about a pilot.  In his job, he is responsible for lives and safety of both his passengers and his crew.  He is deeply aware of it and in  his own mind he finds the best way possible to reconcile his personal failures and shortcomings with self medication by combining alchohol and drugs.  As faith will have it one day acident happens.  This accident is not entirely his fault but the main character (played by Denzel Washington) is \\"found out\\" to be under influence of drugs and alchohol while on duty.  There is too much at stake: financially, legally and ethically.  Can a slick Chicago lawyer (played by Don Cheadle) rescue this pilot and his union and shift the blame on plane manufacturer?  Can this case be won on technicality and what is the price for that?<br /><br />This is where I found film to get its full value.  At the cruicial moment, when all of this can be put side and pilot can walk away free simply by following technicality of the investigative (not even legal) proceedings, his true self comes out.  Behind all addictions and pain there is a decent human being, honest and kind - willing to take a full responsibility for events that took place on himself even though techncially he is not at fault.  He is willing to sacrifice everything and even go to jail in order to preserve dignity and integrity of another human being he cares about.  In spite of all of his weaknesses this man is a hero - because he follows his own convictions and is own moral code.  By the time story comes to its end we learn to respect him and what he stands for.  This is one of the best movies I have seen recently.ceedings, his true self comes out.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Don't be fooled by the cover. Its not as fifty shades as it seems, in fact its downright one of the funniest book i've read in a long time. It's also well written, full of humor and the banters are witty.<br /><br />Its one of those books where, when you start to read it, you cannot just stop. The words draw you in. The sarcasm and wit makes you feel that Drew is actually there talking to you.<br /><br />What a debut book this is! I cant wait wait for her next.

B006UUL5TY|4.0|Recorded in 1980, here comes another entry in the Rockpalast Concert Series. This time around we have the Ian Hunter Band featuring Mick Ronson. This is a full-screen presentation with decent stereo sound. Once again, we have the song titles at the bottom of the screen for the beginning of each song, which is annoying the first couple times, but you get adjusted to it during the concerts running time. The only buyer beware is some video distortion throughout the entire show. This looks like color bands across the screen, and while at first quite annoying, you almost get used to it. I believe this comes from the original television broadcast, and I doubt any sort of remastering processes could fix it. The rarity of the concerts in the Rockpalast Series makes this a worthwhile disc to own though. Let's see the history of Ian Hunter up to the 1980 period of this show.<br /><br />[Wikipedia]<br />Ian Hunter Patterson (born 3 June 1939) is an English singer-songwriter. He was the lead singer of the English rock band Mott the Hoople from its inception in 1969 to its dissolution in 1974, and he again fronted them at the time of their 2009 reunion. Hunter was a musician and songwriter before Mott The Hoople, and he continued in this vein after he left the band. As the leading figure in Mott The Hoople, but facing ill health and disillusioned with commercial success, he embarked on a solo career, often in collaboration with Mott The Hoople's guitarist Mick Ronson, who was well known as David Bowie's sideman and arranger from the Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars period.[1]<br /><br />Mott The Hoople achieved a certain level of commercial success and attracted a small but devoted fan base. As a solo artist, Hunter at times made the charts with lesser-known but more wide-ranging works outside the rock mainstream. Among his best-known solo records are \\"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\\" (later covered by Great White) and \\"Cleveland Rocks,\\" made famous from a cover version on the American TV series The Drew Carey Show.<br /><br />In March 1975 Hunter joined forces with Mick Ronson; during his solo career, Hunter most frequently worked with Ronson until the latter's death in 1993. Hunter's first single from his eponymous solo album was the UK Top 40 hit \\"Once Bitten Twice Shy\\". Hunter and Ronson then parted professionally (reportedly due to Hunter's refusal to have to deal with Ronson's manager at the time, Tony DeFries). Hunter's second solo album, All American Alien Boy, was a more soul-infused work, featuring saxophonist David Sanborn, bassist Jaco Pastorius, and, on one track, Queen (one-time opening act for Mott the Hoople) on backing vocals. With his next album Overnight Angels (produced by Roy Thomas Baker and featuring former Bowie sideman Earl Slick on lead guitar), Hunter opted for a heavier guitar sound. Hunter's record label in America, Columbia Records, refused to release the album in the US. According to Ian Hunter, this was due not so much to dissatisfaction on Columbia's part towards the record, but to issues concerning Hunter's management at the time: \\"Overnight Angels was not released in the US because I fired my manager, Fred Heller, during the English promotional tour - just before it was to be released in America. Columbia said they didn't want to release it until I had new management and that dragged on until it became too late.\\"[14]<br /><br />Mick Ronson returned as producer and guitarist on Hunter's 1979 album You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic, which also featured several members from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band as well as John Cale. Two songs from Schizophrenic became successes for other artists: in late 1979, \\"Ships\\" was covered by Barry Manilow and became a top ten US hit, and in 1997, \\"Cleveland Rocks\\" was covered by the Presidents of the United States of America (whose version was used as the theme song for The Drew Carey Show). \\"Cleveland Rocks\\" is arguably Hunter's most enduring solo song; it is seenas a de facto anthem in Cleveland, Ohio (sometimes used as a victory song for the city's sports teams) and Hunter was given the key to the city by Cleveland mayor Dennis Kucinich on 19 June 1979.[15]<br />[/Wikipedia]<br /><br />here is the tracklisting for this April 19-20 1980 show<br /><br />1.FBI<br />2.Once Bitten, Twice Shy<br />3.Angeline<br />4.Laugh At Me<br />5.Irene Wilde<br />6.I Wish I Was Your Mother<br />7.Just Another Night<br />8.We Gotta Get Out Of Here<br />9.Bastard<br />10.All The Way From Memphis<br />11.Cleveland Rocks<br />12.All The Young Dudes<br />13.Slaughter On 10th Avenue<br /><br />The only bonus feature on the DVD is a trailer for the Ian Hunter Concert.

It is a Tv series about Dc comics green arrow who is known as Oliver Queen. The show starts right after Oliver gets of an uninhabited island named Le'an yu. The show incorperates both the present and the past. It back stories give depth to how much Oliver has changed on that island. They are done well and have an ajecent plot that is well developed and leaves you wanting more. I recommend the show and cant waite for the next season.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The book is a classic and so is this film. The performances of the main actors were all very good, particularly Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe. I have read the book by Victor Hugo at least twice and found it compelling. Then last year I visited France. Having studied 18th century French history at school, it all fitted into place, especially when I saw this rather magnificent production. The history; the politics; the human endeavour by Jean Valjean and his charge and the students; the life dilemma of Javert were admirably portrayed. Through the acting of Russell Crowe,I found myself, in this production, having pity for Javert. What a great story - and there were people like all these characters.
B005LVR6ZA|3.0|Aa a near-charter member of PKD's &#34;cult following,&#34; I never thought I'd give UBIK, which I always considered one of his late masterpieces, anything less that 5 stars.  The problem is that the original version, which I read soon after it came out in 1969, has been extensively revised--I hope by Dick himself.  The result is a more elaborate and probably a structurally superior novel, with more characters and an additional major plot line.  UBIK was one of Dick's novels that the critics at the time saluted as a work of &#34;genius&#34; which, however, was &#34;flawed.&#34;  Also, the revised version may be seen to be closer to Dick's central theme, that we all create our own worlds and no one knows what's really going on until near the end of the story, if then.  However, the more rational plot development loses some of the intensity and plain terror of the more focused treatment given the original antagonist, and therefore the immense relief I remember feeling when his power is finally blunted.  It's as though some of Dick's critics rewrote his book.  Still, it's a good read; and I don't doubt that the added aspects, particularly the new plot line based on &#34;deconstruction&#34; theory, are pure PKD.

0385344333|1.0|I've spent the year reading all the Jack Reacher books. As with all things in a series, some are better than others but I don't think I am making too strong a statement by calling this book the worst Reacher story in the series. This is another book with a terrorist plot (SN:enough on the terrorism already), but the plot is so convoluted it's not really clear who the terrorists are or what is their motivation. Part of the Reacher lure is the need to suspend belief but the story was so ridiculous and the characters so flat, I had to keep referring back to previous pages to remember who was who. I don't know if this was ghost written or just a paycheck book but it was terrible.

I would Highly recommend this app to anyone who has to rely on the weather for anything. I use accuweather to tell when it is advisable to ride my motorcyle and stay dry. In approximately 10 years I have only gotten wet 3 times and hailed on 1 time.
B002RI9UE0|5.0|A man who is &#34;Walking the Talk&#34; - I have read this more than a few times. All youngsters who encounter failures at their initial formative years of career  - shall read this book.  President Obama has lent his wealth of experience and wisdom for people who struggle to find meanings for several unfathomable failures they face in their journey of life. Family values, Code of Ethics for Politicians, high level of integrity in thoughts and actions and assessing the need of the people - these are flowing through his most fertile and incorrupt mind.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was recommended by a friend, but, I was not sure I would like it.  I was WRONG!  Grabbed my attention on the first page and held it to the last work.  Crisp, and to the point...an easy read without all the petty, drawn out descriptions of nothing important.  Arrived in excellent condition and on time.
0871137380|5.0|A Great read. Tells the whole story of one of our worst &#34;peace&#34; worst miltary disasters. It makes one wonder why we have fight wars for others.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I do not remember receiving this disk or viewing the movie, but if it has Tom in it, it has to be good.
B0030A0ZD4|3.0|As a sort of extended music video compilation, this is a great showcase outstanding music and dance sequences. As a film, it's a mixed bag but nevertheless quite entertaining.<br /><br />However, comparing it to the VHS and DVD releases, this UK Blu-ray is slightly censored. About 66 minutes in, Mr. Big striking Katie is missing and soon after his threatening of her with a heroin-filled needle is also missing. These scenes appear to have been removed by the distibutor before submission to the BBFC (the British censor), and at the time of writing I am unaware of any uncensored Blu-ray edition anywhere in the world.<br /><br />Here's hoping the US release will be uncut.
0439023513|5.0|This is a great sequel  I loved the book! It is a quick read, no blah, blah, blah descriptions to drag out the story. Arrived in excellent condition and on time.  I will certainly use this vendor again.
0143118757|5.0|Great read....helps in everyday negotiating and learning how to listen to others needs before attempting to ask for what you're looking for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 16 yr old & I are hooked! Stumped us several times. Very fun game!! Awesome challenge and a  great way to waste time.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Yet another underrated Cruise movie.  This guy should 3 Oscars by now. Reacher had the right amount of action and plot twists.  Robert Duval was a nice surprise and nailed his character.
0439023491|5.0|Loved the book!!  It arrived on time and in excellent condition. Written in the same style as the previous two, crisp, clean and to the point.  Will use this vendor again.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Fun to watch, lots of laughs, lots of action.  Not for the Sherlock Holmes purist.  The first in a (probably) long series.
B000AMJC2K|2.0|hard to adjust  since you have to squeeze the middle section for up and down and it projects to close unless you desk is more than 2 ft deep
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is really good but sometimes on the kindle fire, the bottom buttons are small and take a couple trys to get them to work.
0345529057|5.0|The show got me interested in the books. I'm not much of a reader, but I still loved the books. The plot slows down with book 4, but I'm still looking forward to getting book 5 soon.
0800177177|5.0|Bought this to replace the one we had and cannot find. The price was great and since we never get tired of seeing this movie, it was well worth the effort to get it replaced! It arrived quickly as well!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved Entwined with You. It really gave more depth and substance to Gideon and Eva's relationship than just sex. I am excited to see two more books coming and can't wait to see where their relationship heads!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Somewhat different h.o. game.  I really like the challenge and a couple had me stumped for a bit.  Hurry with updates. ..can hardly wait.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to play  it's very addictive I love this game gets hard after awhile but I love to play it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game to play for all ages.  My kids really enjoyed playing the app.  Unfortunately, there wasn't more levels to play after 10 or so.  I recommend it if you have some downtime and looking for a fun game to play.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Incredible production. Well worth the time. Too bad there wasn't a longer transition between scenes. A great cast & cinematography.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|The Movie came as promised, no problems, no damage, everything worked and my daughter loves it.  Would definitely purchase again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so much fun , I'm glad I found it , it's so fun to play! . I'll tell all my friends about it
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The conflicts among the characters was well played and it was really nice that the actual performers in real life played roles in the movie.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|SOME STORIES ARE BETTER THAN  FICTION<br />THIS IS A POINT BLANK STORY OF THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO GO OFF TO WAR AND THEN BECOME MUCH DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF IT NEVER TO FORGET WHAT CHANGED THEIR LIFE
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Watch the preview to know how to do it. This very fun! Would be a good challenge for preteens instead of regular video games.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Only a quarter of the way through this book and loving it. Dan Brown had done it again. Can't wait to read Inferno.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play with my brother on it we bear up zombies,we make weapons,we also build of course<br />Y'all should buy this awesome app!!!
1892005034|5.0|It has really helped understand better and more efficient ways to communicate.  A fantastic book to help marriages, business and any other relationship.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have had the pleasure to watch in years!  Well written, well directed, beautifully performed.  Believable characters.  Excellent cast.  It exceeded my expectations all around.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keep your eyes peeled and use your wits to conquer these cool games. Don't give up just keep pressing on. Use your mind in every way possible to escape!!!!!
1451648537|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book. Bought it from Amazon when I was only 100 pages from finishing a library's copy. Want to read it again and again. I'm a huge fan of Steve's drive, talent, thinking, Atari, Apple, and Pixar. What an amazing, gifted, and yes flawed human he was.
1611761808|5.0|Absolutely beautiful book.  I loved all three but this one again, has so much heart.  I will love these characters forever.
B00B4804KS|5.0|This is an excellent movie when seen in 2D and it was a big hit when it originally came out. It was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D years after original production and the result is perfect. You wouldn't ever think it wasn't shot in 3D because the 3D depth is perfect. The artificial 3D created by my TV when it converts a movie from 2D to 3D doesn't come close to this Hollywood conversion.
B000P0J024|5.0|Have wanted this cd for some time. Finally bought and like it even more than i thought i would. Great songs, harmonies and  lyrics.
1400052181|5.0|This is a non-fiction book about the HeLa cell and where those cells originated.  It tells the story of the woman behind the cells.  The impact of these cells on modern science, and the glimpse into early-mid 20th Century America had me totally and completely fascinated.  Great book, great information.  I loved every minute of it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a wonderful book. It kept me wanting to know more what was going to happen next. The characters were so real to the time period. I would definitely recommend this book and it would be a good one for a book club to discuss.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|With all of my degrees and years of teaching I still find this to be a pleasant and happy adventure. It's not great literature but may be a bit more fun.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Purchased the 2nd book so decided to read it.  I did not finish it because I was not interested in where the characters were going.  I found the characters to be shallow without substance.
0802130208|5.0|This is my all time favorite book. I have a second edition published by the University his mom took it to to get it published. As someone else said, you will laugh out loud. Read it over and over. I tell everyone to read it.  So happy to see it on this great list.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun distracting game. Like others have said not too easy but not too difficult. Ad supported but not too obtrusive so kudos to the developer.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is a nicely crafted series. Howey does an admirabe job of putting the reader in the post-apolcalyptic silo. Characters are well-written, storyline sequence is masterful.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After reading into the so called story it seemed to repeat the same theme over and over.<br />Very perdictable plot.  No MEAT.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Since my 8-year-old grandson knows where I keep the flashlights, when I need one the batteries are usually dead.  The flashlight app on my Kindle provides me with just about the same amount of light - and with the storms we've had lately, it's been in a lot of use.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Thank God for RHCP.  Even after 30 years, they know how to deliver funky licks and rockin' tunes.<br /><br />Sure, you could argue that their sound has been tweaked for 'mainstream appeal', but, like 'Stadium Arcadium', this is NOT a bad thing.  Also like that grammy-winning double feature, this an album worthy of a full play through.<br /><br />There aren't any A+ tracks here, but there's a few B+'s and nothing below a C+ (arguably a B-).<br /><br />'I'm With You' is RHCP in a cool cruise control and it's how you should listen to it.<br /><br />On a nice sunny day throw on your shades, get in your car, go and find yourself a nice stretch of highway, roll down the windows, and blast this baby.
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|I almost was gonna write this thing off completely, but I changed my mind and am completely satisfied. This is good work. Really, if nothing else,  Ozzys best in a very long time...<br /><br />Eff Bill. Let me get this out of the way first so that I can proceed with this review. Black Sabbath (in hindsight and retrospect) essentially has come to mean over the years 'whatever band Tony Iommi has got going now'  But I think it was during the late nineties that kids like myself started raising a royal hell over the purity of what could actually be classified as a Sabbath album. Dio is acceptable, we guess, but otherwise unless you were 14 at some point during the nineteen eighties, Sabbath without question has to be helmed by Ozzy. And since 2001 the law has been that at least three members of the core four have to be involved, so long as they are alive and can speak in at least a handful of syllables.  This being said, I heard Ozzy scream the phrase 'Bill Ward on drums!' at least fifteen hundred times in the span of three shows between 1999 and 2001. I can live without him, seeing as it was his wish to remain off the new record. What can you do?<br /><br />ANYWAY... Lets get to it! 8 tracks. Lean and mean. Not trying to be a showboat of Sharon style love ballads either. The band jams, gets spacey, gets psychedelic; Ozzy plays Harmonica! Ozzy sings a bit more baritone than we were used to in 1970, just in case you have been in a cave since then, but he has that psycho spark in his voice and he carries it with care (as opposed to the last like six studio albums...) I heard he was secretly on a ton of drugs, but whateves. He took one for the team. Not everything, (if anything) really, truly sounds like it would have way back then, but the spirit is absolutely alive! END OF THE BEGGINING is essential to the GOD IS DEAD? track, creating a solid quarter slice of real FM album style rock. I wiped a small tear from my eye. ZEITGEIST is a slow mellow bit, a bit derivative of  (Planet) Caravan, but thats not necessarilly a bad thing (...its not a bad thing at all). Rick Rubins best attribute as usual I think, is knowing how the fans think. If you didn't think Sab could bring the spark back, check it out as a lean mean eight cut record.t thats not necessarilly a bad thing (...its not a bad thing at all). Rick Rubins best attribute as usual I think, is knowing how the fans think. If you didn't think Sab could bring the spark back, check it out as a lean mean eight cut record.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Very cute game, great detail,  lots of fun creativity. Only hard to collect hearts if no friends gifting, we reached max level before completion. Wish could trade coins for gems to get other items.
B00846REIS|5.0|While there are some similarities to the Fifty Shades series, this first Crossfire book was amazing. The passion and still evolving love between Gideon and Eva keeps you turning the pages and longing for more.
1600595871|5.0|For any book lover who wants to learn how to make and bind their own books, this is the go-to resource. Again, this book was in my local library and I HAD to have it. I've made a number of books before finding this resource, and wish I'd had this book to learn from. I recently completed a photo book using tips from this edition, and the recipient was &#34;blown away&#34; as she put it. Fantastic book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the new colored clothes they have that they can change into. I wish it was possible to go back to the other places that was on the world tour so I could get those characters. All in all, I give this game a 5/5
0307987698|5.0|This is an excellent follow up to the previous Monster at the end of the book.  They are going to love this one also!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game if you like to solve puzzles.  Similar to elevator game.  Really forces you to think &quot;outside of the box&quot;!
B003QTUQGU|4.0|just wanted a movie with no thinking involved and found this to do the trick, so my mind was out of gear to all stress
B008S80P38|5.0|The last time I listened to house was back in Brooklyn Bounce times and The Second Attack, and thought it was a music for younger ppl.<br /><br />But I found this one to be a great album. It's a very mature house music, unlike the most you find at clubs.<br /><br />What one reviewer said here - \\"Unfortunately, only the first 10 songs are good.\\" - really made me laugh. I personally don't remember the last time I loved all tracks on an album, and the last three tracks are just different and not bad at all, chilling you out kind of :)
037582913X|5.0|my grandchildren have LOVED this book for years.  This is the 5th copy we've had and this one is for the gr grandson now!  My grandchildren still enjoy hearing it and most are in their 20's.  Of course sound effects and how much you can sound like Grover helps!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I did not read the books, My best friend who got me hooked did.  Love having him as a side kick to explain the details.  It truly is a roller coaster ride.  SO well done!!! I can understand the story line without having read them.  Extremely suspenseful and just plain fun to watch.  Love that they did not dumb down the sex and violence, and do not feel any of it is ever gratuitous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very captivating I couldn't put it down. I love this game so much, I stayed up all night playing this game

B0042GIRYE|5.0|I was introduced to this band on the radio, and this is the first album I have purchased (I bought the MP3 album).  It was well worth it in my opinion.  I haven't been disappointed by any of the songs.  I love their style and their music.

0321934946|5.0|Just getting into Digital photography in earnest. Long ago used a 35mm SLR. But the digital camera brings more options to the table, MANY more options. I enjoy the humor in the book, and I find the illustrations and helpful hints very helpful. In fact, I got my nephew a copy - he is more interested in film photography, right now, but even so, this has tons of great information about setting up shots, etc. I think this book is the best of three that I bought for helping me move forward with my skills in photography.
0446572985|5.0|Always a good read from a great author.<br />Suspenseful and thought provoking.<br />A masterful story of innocence and deceit.<br />Great summer read!

B008JFUTT0|5.0|I first heard about this documentary when Jeff Probst had the director/producer and Sixto on his show a month or so ago. I had written down the name of the movie, intending to rent it. Then it came on cable tv, so I recorded it, and just watched it this weekend. I was totally blown away. By both the music and by the wonderful story. Sixto is a wonderful human being. I have now purchased the DVD and the two albums. I certainly hope that he is getting the royalties on these album sales! Perhaps, better late than never, he will tour in the US, and I will get a chance to see him in person.
B00ADQOEDU|1.0|This show is excessively violet with nudity and a total disregard for morality. It is not acting or a skilled plot, simply shock value and aggression. A sorry excuse for entertainment.
B00198X0VS|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie and I am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I bought this for my 8.9&#34; HD Kindle Fire in case I wanted to use my tablet to produce a letter, etc. The full version allows me to do more than the basic version. It works wonderfully and I would recommend it.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Worth watching.  Decent acting.  The plot is a bit too predictable though.  Hansel and Gretal survive the witch as per the fairy tale.  Hansel and Gretel grow up to hunt witches in a rather R-rated fashion.  They are very good at what they do but come across a situation involving a whole lot of witches and one very powerful witch that tests their abilities and reveals why they are particularly good at their job,as the plot unfolds.<br /><br />A good story but easily guessed where it goes next.  Zero potential for a second movie.  What witches are, their motivation other than...arrrg, let's harm decent folk who are just minding their own business, is left out.  The reason for the witches gathering is, quite frankly weak.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I am happy with it and I have been taking lots of pics and now can save them from camera. Thanks

B001JRB16U|5.0|Just had to get this on DVD.  Use to watch this all the time as a little girl and wanted to add this as part of my collection.  This was truly a classic for me.  Instead of Cinderella, it was Mary Poppins for me.  It was magical and it taught you morals.  Not this fairy tale where the girl gets her prince from rags to riches.  Yeah I really want my daughter looking up to that.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie and I am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it.
0156027321|5.0|Is it fantasy, experience, hallucination or wishful thinking?  No matter, it is an intriguing, mysterious read, one that I will revisit from time to time.  It is a very charming tale.
0307200477|4.0|This is a classic book and a great way to combine reading and activity with a small child.  I appreciate that it attempts to engage all five senses, but I HATE the smell of the flowers.  It is a very overpowering, fake floral/powder smell that I find very bothersome.  I have left the book open in my garage to hopefully air it out.  Despite my dislike of the smell, this is a simple fun book to share with a little one.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This mix of songs brings a variety I haven't found on other albums.  Loved this show for the story, but especially the music.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Loved this story. One of my favorites in this series. Ms. Singh has become my favorite author.<br />Kaleb is a fascinating character. Could not put the book down that hasn't happened in a while.<br />I am anxiously waiting for the next Arch Angel novel I hope it is close to this good.

B004QZ9PLU|4.0|If you are leary of melodrama, pass this one up.  I will read every book Spark writes.  Just cannot help being touched by his characters.
0670033049|3.0|The book is in decent condition,, but is covered with the usual stamps, stickers, and lamentation that libraries apply to their books.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|Another nice story by Nicholas Sparks. I find them to be somewhat predictable...yet I keep reading!  The characters are always interesting...and I especially liked the characters in this story. It's a fast read.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|Flight is well-acted and provides a great story about doing the right thing, but because of the subject matter, should only be seen by mature audiences.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me guessing which character was the good guy and which was the bad guy. It kept switching back and forth.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|For the price, I run most of my game with very high or high graphic quality, amazing! You need this in your Pc!

B009329ZF2|5.0|Battleship is one of the great science-fiction war movies of our time with sacrifice, valor, and love as its theme!  You'll enjoy watching Battleship over and over!
0375826742|5.0|Its a very good third book of the series. It ends openly so as to leave an interest for the fourth book, but it doesn't really leave open ends that you as a reader would like to see through before the end of the book.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Minecraft is so fun but some things we could all agree we want is minecarts and tracks. Another thing is letting people set off tnt in creative mode. This game is so fun and would be even better with more additions every now and then. The latest update was cool but people were expecting pressure plates and stuff like that. All I ask is that you read this and take it into consideration. Just think about it.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|I really have enjoyed the movie and am glad to have obtained it for my collection. You must own it also

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Charlie is an extremely likable character and I'm assured that nearly everyone who has read or will read the book will find themselves in him. I was happy,sad,inspired, and shocked through the events during the course of the book. I look forward to reading more and this book has sparked a newly-found exploration in me I never knew I had within. Thank you Stephen Chbosky.
B001AQO446|4.0|Incredibly stupid at times, but just such a fun movie, with great music. Can't but enjoy it. Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin are highlights.

1400052181|5.0|This book is an eye opener, and should be read in every school-Summer Reading. I enjoyed it especially<br />since I am a medical professional,yet this book spells out a far reaching story that effects everyone's life.<br />The details are amazing and Skloot has done her homework. What a great book!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Slightly more difficult to win at the Windows version. Pop-ups at the beginnings were a bit annoying, but I didn't have the videos that others reported.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|This movie was clearly low-tech, even compared with some of the earlier ones.  And the movie is all the best for it!  The producers and director needed to then think a clever and humorous plot, and they succeeded.  It is a nice little movie, highly entertaining, with time travel and all.  Pity at the end Jim gets just a kiss in the cheek, forgoing his classic french kissing the girl, LOL!  Then again, this is one of the even numbered Star Treks, meaning it is bound to be good!

B00628RVV0|4.0|The movie is well done, but should not have a PG 13 rating.  Although the atrocities of the Nazi Gerrmans during WWII are not graphically portrayed, there is the feeling of impending horror.  By all means, see it, but after kids and teens are in bed.  Amazon needs to remove it from the kid category search.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is so fun, there is NO other way to explain it. You get gems from friends if your signed in with Facebook and can give them gems and also visit their parks. You raise your dragons and breed them to get special dragons that cost too many gems to buy. For instance, breeding the Crystal Dragon and the lichen Dragon in that order will get you moon, Sun, and other rare dragons, but it may take many tries as it did for me.

0691143692|3.0|My Greek teacher Dr. Robert Ross used to warn me about books \\"with an axe to grind\\", and this is definitely one of them. In writing it, Judith Herrin clearly set out to dispel centuries of pejorative preconceptions and put together a robust apologia for this millennium-long empire that seemed to have died with no direct descendants.<br />While I would take issue with some points, such as the claim that Byzantium essentially \\"saved\\" Western Europe from Islam, she mounts a brilliant defense on the whole. But perhaps because of her objective, this unabashed encomium makes for flat textbook-type reading too often. I found the account generally woodsy and humorless. Herrin is definitely not a storyteller. For example, in the hands of Japanese historian Koichi Inoue, the colorful Empress Zoe of the Macedonian dynasty, who is depicted on the cover of Herrin's book, is the subject of many delicious anecdotes that, veracity aside, provide engrossing insights into her times and pique the reader's interest. Herrin unfortunately omits these, presumably because her history is not people-centered. (Yet she devotes a whole chapter to Anna Komnene, who chronicled the career of her imperial father in the eulogistic \\"Alexiad\\", and it is one of the better chapters in the book.) Here she has much to learn from her compatriot Jason Goodwin, whose \\"Lords of the Horizon\\" portrayal of the Ottoman Empire, which is also organized in terms of topics, is a better read by far. In sum, I was expecting much more from Herrin's Byzantium.<br />One last thing - in her chapter on them, Herrin implies the existence of eunuchs as an institution in Japan, but this is simply not true. Her mention of the \\"great medieval empire of Japan\\" is likewise a gross mischaracterization, seeing that the country didn't even completely control Hokkaido and Okinawa, much less other countries, until the mid-19th century, and was almost never actually ruled by its emperor or the court during its middle ages. Similarly, her nameless reference to a eunuch \\"Japanese naval commander who certainly sailed as far as the East Indies\\" is a mystery to me. Perhaps someone can enlighten me about his identity.<br />- James Koetting, February, 2012

B008K9SG9K|5.0|With the boom of iTunes and Amazon selling one song at a time, I've stopped buying whole CDs because rarely do artists have 13 songs worth listening to.  However, this entire CD is great and the ordering of the CD doesn't leave the listener shutting it off 1/2 way through.  Plus, an added perk is that it's clean.  The artists use actual talent and catchy tunes to get you attached.

B000IY06CK|4.0|This very well recorded disc from 2006 contains one of the finest versions of the concertos plus an unusual selection of other works by Tchaikovsky featuring the violin as soloist. This will make this disc quite distinct from those many alternatives that feature another unrelated concerto for example.<br /><br />Julia Fischer, since recording this disc, has continued to build her reputation as one of the finest of current young soloists, She has an impressive technical command of the instrument plus the ability to have something to say about the music she is playing. Fortunately she is able to create that feeling of communication within a recording studio environment as here. Not all soloists who are outstanding on stage in front of an audience are able to communicate and create that 'live' feeling within a recording studio so Julia Fischer has a relatively rare talent in that respect.<br /><br />She plays the concerto in its full uncut version. Older recordings frequently made a number of cuts in the last movement especially. The performance has a clear forward pulse and that creates its own excitement. The orchestral support is excellent and climaxes are unerringly met. The slow movement has a nice lyrical flow and the final movement is not over-driven and still has a sense of dance about it. This is one of the best performances currently available.<br /><br />The Valse-Scherzo was a pre-runner to the concerto and maybe here the composer was trying out ideas for writing with a solo violin in mind. The Meditation which opens the three Souvenirs was apparently considered as the concerto's original slow movement before being replaced by the Canzonetta. The Serenade is pleasant enough but not a major work. These fill-ups therefore have some interest but do not have the same quality of inspiration to offer as a renowned concerto to match the Tchaikovsky. This fill-up situation will be contentious for many purchasers and there is a case for considering this as a doubtful commercial decision in such a competitive market.<br /><br />In conclusion I would suggest that the concerto deserves to be considered along with the very best but I would also suggest that the choice of couplings, while being imaginative and different, may be less of a commercial or musical attraction for collectors, and especially for those looking for an 'only' version.l commercial decision in such a competitive market.<br /><br />In conclusion I would suggest that the concerto deserves to be considered along with the very best but I would also suggest that the choice of couplings, while being imaginative and different, may be less of a commercial or musical attraction for collectors, and especially for those looking for an 'only' version.

0060987464|2.0|I had marginal interest in his music.  I typically respect any musician to a certain level and if I read their story and how they got to where they are, probably even more so.  I think I have less respect for him now than I did before reading this book.  Yep, rough life, I'll give him that.  But as an adult he is so full of himself.  And yes, I'll agree, I look at him as performance art and not a musician...whereas before I thought he was possibly a serious musician.  He is so far above everyone else with his \\"thinking\\" and \\"meaning\\" behind his songs, band members' names, his lifestyle, etc, that I no longer think I am worthy to even listen to one of his songs.  After about 50% of the way thru, I just skimmed the book as it was just too repetitive.  Meh.<br /><br />Snort another line, Brian, maybe you'll come up with something more interesting. Are you even relevant in the music scene any longer?  Two stars for the effort....that is, if you really took part in writing this.

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|The spooky side of troubled twins is the lynchpin for this book with a mysterious reclusive writer dictating her memoirs to a young woman she chose to be her biographer. The book has touches of Gothic masterpiece as much of the story centers on the crumbling mansion in the English countryside where the central family resides. The troubled writer lives in a different dark rambling home amidst wonderful gardens on the Moors, there are dark secrets, a fire, murders, deaths, and family tragedies at every turn. The young woman writing the memoir is of interest with some parallels in her own sad family life and that of the recluse. The ending is particularly well written.

My heart caught a memory and traveled to a distant land to experience the echoes of past family relationships and the bonds that entwined among them. It was magical, captivating, soulful and at times wrought with the pain of loss. Each chapter was a story within itself but also collectively was a part of the whole tapestry tucked among the pages. To read and become engaged in the betrayal, tragedy and the innermost secrets of families and the effects it carries through the ages and spans the test of times leaves me with the feeling that I witnessed the story and dynamics of many generations. A wonderful masterpiece that spans the heritage and captivates the essence of family bonds and love that never dies.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|A Nice game for anyone to play. As an added bonus the game does not require real money to enjoy unlike some other time management games. Overall fantastic game for anyone who likes horses.

B0031TZ8TU|5.0|I read this when it came out and, with Argo and Zero Dark Thirty so popular, I was moved to read On Wings of Eagles again.  It is a great book about a number of great Texans and still so relevant today.
B00D41H2PS|4.0|I love these types of mysteries.  This one is okay but way too short.  It takes a while to figure out the location for one or two of the key items but even then, you finish in just a few minutes.  I'd love to see more like this.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie and am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love Hunger Games. I have read the series about a hundred times and now I have the ebook of Hunger Games so I can take it anywhere!!!

B00AWJYJVA|5.0|I have read every Le Carre and each time I wonder how he continues to write his typical Le Carre style and adapting from the Cold War to current times. A most enjoyable book with characters perhaps more likeable than others but with a resonating contempt for the bureaucracy. I will look forward to the next Le Carre.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|The characters were well described, it was a good mixture of drama and entertainment. One could relate to the story, and possibly recognise a few of the traits in other people.
B000GBEWHA|3.0|The movie needs more work with its weak plot and confussing theme, music and charaters but the car is great.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I own every season of Castle and have loved them all! I cannot wait for the next season. The only complaint I have is the cost of each season. I am planning on setting up season 6 on my DVR.
B00782O7IY|1.0|The main character is so self centered, no wonder his wife left him! He's arrogant and as shallow as a baby pool. If you're looking to quench your thirst for a good film, go back to the originals, when actors could act and story lines were less predictable!

B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved his previous books, but, I found this  one harder to follow,<br />It jumps around generations and countrys and names.
1432794426|4.0|I have been a huge Michael Lover, since the age of 9 years old (about 25 years)... I knew a lot of what this book referenced to in his past years and was intrigued by the later years of his life... I enjoy hearing about how he was with his children and I appreciated the stories from his security team about his ' girlfriends', which helped shine light on his private sexy side without getting to detailed or intrusive.  Mostly though as I read the book, I felt a bit of repetition that seemed a bit endless. Although I genuinely understood the constant need to repeat how awesome Michael is (was) I felt that the book could have been much shorter, and there was a great deal of build up about the security guards, and it lead me to think there was gong to be more in there about their story, but most of the book was well written and interesting... I did feel a little stunted at the end of this 500+ page book...throughout its many pages, due to the constant reiteration, I felt that more could have been added, but all in all, I appreciate it any time someone has something wonderful to say about such a wonderful man like MJ... I only wish it was written while he was here to see it with his own eyes.... I hope he is able to feel the love... God Bless you Michael!<br /><br />***final review, nut shell... worth the read, educated author, well written, too much repeat repeat, thank you for caring enough to write this book Dr. Moriarty....

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing! I  can't  wait to read the next books in the trilogy. I've seen the movie, but the book is so much better. I'm so glad that Kindle Prime offered it for free. I couldn't put it down!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It has been a really good book every time I have read it I would definitely recommend this book to people 12 and older because of a bit of foul language.Also this is very different from the movie.
