B00004XONN|5.0|This is an amazing record.  Although not as experimental as some may have lead us to believe it would be, it still uses the typical Radiohead textures in a more electronic light.<br />guitar only appears on three tracks here, and Yorke's voice is many times engulfed in electronic effects, but rest assured, they still come off as Radiohead.<br />It's still eerily depressing sounding, like normal, with odd effects, drumbeats, horn sections, harmonic effects, and whatnot in the background.<br />Pick this up.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Anything Greenday does is awesome but this takes it.  Worth the $$.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day promised one of the most diverse albums of any band around, and they delivered. While some more punk rock may have been beneficial to satisfy their long term fans, this album has  the grunt to go all they way to the top. While Songs such as misery and macy's day parade bring Green Day closer to the main stream, other songs such as Castaway and Hold on provide the pure punk grit that made dookie such a smash. Lyrically, this album is far above any before it. I give it 5 stars.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Of any movie I have seen, this movie makes you root for the good guy and hope the bad guy bites it more than any other movie. The dipiction of the Roman Empire at that time is exquisite and nowhere else will you see a combination of action and diologue that fit the bill.
B00004XONN|5.0|I really liked this record.  Radiohead is a great, great band; they're easily the most important rock band out there right now.  That being said, this record is not a straight rock record.  There are elements of techno, trance, even (I come from a jazz background so forgive me) some elements of Miles Davis and John Coltrane.  The keyboard sounds, especially, sound like something off a really phenomonall (spelling?) Miles Davis record from 1969 called &quot;In A Silent Way.&quot;  At any rate, this is a great record.  If you like intelligent, well-thought out, but still agonizingly express music, you'll like it too.
B00004X01U|5.0|&quot;Music&quot; is a terrific song worthy of tons of awards and more noteriety than it has been getting lately. The new Madonna Album deserves Grammys, MTV moonmen and every other possible award. Madonna knows just how to make albums. Not too peppy, not too mellow, but somewhere in the middle. You go girl!
B00004XONN|5.0|Pre-reviews for &quot;Kid A&quot; have made the record sound like an impenetrable fortress of sound, an unwelcoming fortress at that.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  &quot;Kid A&quot; might be a bit different, well a lot different, than modern rock and top forty but it isn't &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;.  No matter what these guys try to do, their songs have an epic, sweeping quality that appeals to those who like a bit of drama.  &quot;Kid A&quot; is a quite natural step from the guitar/piano driven epics of &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; (forget about &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; - it sounds like a batch of demos compared to the later works), and it challenges the listener - not in a defiant way, more like in a gentle, calm manner - to accept these non-pop pop songs.  Overall a gorgeous, if a bit unnerving at times modern classic.
B00004XONN|5.0|Very good bunch of music. The kind you never get sick of.. just try it. One very good example of how electronic music cannot suck so bad all the time.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is the most recent CD i have purchased and I am glad I did. This is a mix of Insomniac and Nimrod. It has so many differences between each song. It is also their longest CD so you get your moey's worth. I reccomend this CD to all!!!
B00000JCEC|4.0|Released at a time in which Ringo's solo work was regarded more as a hobby than a career, \\"Time\\" turned out to be Ringo's most serious and musically consistent album. Though there are multiple producers and writers involved, the songs all seem tied by a theme: cautions about life's hard knocks from someone who's been there.    The sound is professional, and Ringo seems to be trying hard to be a real singer here, not just some pal who likes to belt out tunes. It really raised my opinon of Ringo, and I'm glad I have it in my collection.
B00004XONN|5.0|This CD is a complete masterpiece. Been listening to it for over a month now, and it gets better by the day. Starting with the 'trippy' sounds of everything in its right place and ending with the somber and more 'normal' song motion picture. From start to finish, this cd is great; it evokes such great feelings and emotions and it shows you radiohead's passion on this work. Definitely the CD of the year; whether you like or dislike this cd or its music, you cannot possibly deny the talent of this band, and the great art of work that is Kid A. Buy it, if you want some real music and would like a break from the fake rock (I.E. Limp Bizkit, Korn) and the Generic Music (Nsync, Britney).
B00004WKII|4.0|I am a longtime guitarist and Jimi fan myself, so of course I had to buy this immediately. Over all, I think it's a good addition for us hardcore Jimi fans, but it's not for everyone. There's a reason a lot of this stuff was unreleased: much of it is sub-par, especially the live tracks (except for Monterey). Jimi was an inconsistent player live, and was often plagued with equipment problems, and thats evident on a few tracks. Some of it makes me cringe, and I'm a HUGE Jimi fan. I'm sure Jimi would never have wanted some of this stuff released. Oh well, it's beyond his control.  Bear in mind that a lot of the time, if his playing on a live recording is sloppy, it's because he was playing the guitar behind his back, laying on the floor, or who knows what, doing his &quot;show&quot;. That just doesnt translate well on an audio recording, you don't see the visual, you just hear the sloppy playing. For instance, listening to &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; from the Berkeley performance is nothing like watching it on the film. You are missing half of the &quot;experience&quot;.  In my opinion, there are better live cuts in existence than some of the ones included here. The out of print &quot;Jimi Hendrix Concerts&quot; has some superior performances, especially of &quot;I Dont Live Today&quot;. There are some performances from the Winterland and Albert Hall that are wonderful, that could have been included. The studio cuts are what really make this set worth it, although I do agree with previous reviewers that some are nearly identical to the originals. Like &quot;EZY Rider&quot;, it's an almost identical mix except for the lead solo. But it's great fun to hear Jimi doing the voices from &quot;3rd Stone&quot;, and goofing around in the studio. The packaging is wonderfully done, with lots of great pictures and notes.  All in all, this is a good addition to any hardcore Jimi fans' collection, one just has to wonder how Jimi would feel about some of this stuff being released.
6305903182|1.0|Congrats Wes! If Scream was a TV sitcom this is what it would look like. There's not a original or funny scene in this movie...the blooper reel is more entertaining with Parker Posey playing nimbly off Courtney Cox's tired, overblown charicature. She seems to be the only one who tries to have fun with the material, and even she can't lift it. I've seen Scooby-Doo episodes that are more complex. And Neve honey, go back to TV with your 2 facial expressions, you're fifteen minutes are up.
B00004RFCM|4.0|This is the best series on television right now. Hands down! I would love to see Seinfeld with a DVD collection of its own! Sure, the content can be quite disturbing to some viewers, but I am not one of those. I am a guy in his 20s who loves sex....and the city!<br />My only complaint is the video quality. A friend of mine has teh VHS version and sometimes it produces better images than my dvd copy. And its not my machine, this is a complaint I have heard of  many times before. At times the images are very grainy, and make it difficult to view some objects in the backround. <br />You might be saying who cares!  Well, they shouldn't bother with the DVD version if they can't get the video quality straighted out. Hopefully for the second season HBO will realize this.
B00004U8H4|4.0|First of all, it's virtually impossible to recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't read the book. It's incredibly complicated material and if you're in any way literal minded, or prefer the easy sitcom type entertainment of most commercial film you just won't get it. <br />While I agree with Harron's choice to make the movie more violent than not, I believe she misses the boat quite blatantly by inferring increasingly toward the end of the picture that Bateman is really just cracking up, not a complete homicidal maniac. This is due mostly to the script which plays as rigid satire up to the last third, when Bateman goes from a sterile psychotic rigidness abruptly to a quivering, sobbing mess. It's just not plausible given he shows no signs of losing control to that point. <br />Did he suddenly realize he was a nut case? Not likely. To imply that would imply he had a conscience, and anyone who knows the Bateman of the book knows that's not a possibility.<br />Even though I'm sure it's not, it ultimately playd as something of a cop-out. Still, it's of the best adaptations that could have been performed, given the material. I honestly didn't think it could be pulled off at all...tough balancing act.
B000002IXS|5.0|The Name Mireille Mathieu mostly releases two reactions: total adoration or total ignoration. the latter because she often was regarded as a mere copy of E. Piaf. Despite the fact that she totally refused to sing Piaf songs at the beginning of her career which emphazises her uniquiness. Adoration because Mireille is a living Vulcano full of emotions and talent, which she always  proves when on stage. She doesn't only have total comand over her powerful voice, (as many singers fail to have nowadays), but she also has a fantastic charisma, making her one of the most powerful singers ever ! France and the French song can be proud of  such a cultural ambassador. Anyone who owns at least one CD of Mireille Mathieu will have an outstanding taste and collection.
B00004XONN|5.0|I recently read an article including an interview (gasp!) with Thom Yorke.  It consisted solely of e-mails between Thom and the interviewer and concluded with Thom deconstructing the exact medium in which he was communicating, breaking down the word &quot;personality&quot; into gibberish that, while incoherent in itself, made up a coherency within the symbolic nature of language.  In other words, Mr. Yorke is a structuralist.   The same occurs on Radiohead's newest album &quot;Kid A&quot;.  The music is haunting, lush, and isolating.  The album opens with &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot;, filled with haunting organs that build into a crescendo of dissonance and off-kilter rhythm, with schizophrenic vocals popping up here and there.  It later morphs to an almost traditional rock track (as traditional as Radiohead gets) on the track &quot;Optimistic&quot;.  Images of &quot;OK Computer&quot; are scattered throughout the album.  &quot;Optimistic&quot; breathes nostalgia for &quot;The Bends&quot;.  Yet, Mr. Yorke and family seem to be deconstructing themselves.  They are and are not Radiohead.  This album is not &quot;OK Computer&quot; nor is it &quot;The Bends&quot; nor is it &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.  It is, in a sense, isolated from everything else created.  The forgotten younger child that ran away to join the circus only to find French Existentialism.  As mentioned in the Amazon review, &quot;OK Computer&quot; was confrontational and angsty towards the close of the millennium.  In its technophobia and existential anxiety, &quot;OK Computer&quot; was the perfect exploration of humanity's isolation from itself through technology &quot;Fitter Happier...&quot;  &quot;Kid A&quot; seems to simply exist in this isolation.  The music is discordant at times and harmonious at others.  It's like a busy airport, with the cacophony of noises and electronic bleeps and blips coming over the intercom, yet standing in a completely desolate terminal, with no one andnothing.  All around activity is taking place, yet you are alone and isolated, watching the planes take off and land, observing everything in its right place.  Except, that is, yourself.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Definetly one of Green Day's BEST CD's to date.  I usually buy a CD for one or two songs, but after hearing several songs off this album, I am hooked.  &quot;Minority&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot; are two of the best songs on this CD.  Both kind of have a punk mix and the kind of beat that get's people hooked on the songs.  A must buy for any Green Day fan.<br />Teenagers and younger adults alike can definetly identify with the lyrics to these two songs, and the revelance to today's society really hits home.
6305922756|5.0|This is a great movie. Can hardly believe that McKean did such a good job as a musician; seeing as he has been on  X-files and Dream On.  I mean, what a verstitile (sp) actor!  And who could deny that the charater know as Nigel Tufnel is non other than Jeff Beck! Give it 2 thumbs up!!
B00004XONN|5.0|This album has redefined the way I look at music.  The most original piece of work in years.  Only for the open-minded.  Repeat listenings required to re-train your ears.
B000003BF4|5.0|A simply flawless live performance from the Legends of London!  This Stones CD has always been my favorite Stones' album.  Besides being a legendary CD from a legendary band it's a great party album and will provide loads of pure rock n' roll enjoyment!
B00004XONN|4.0|I have awaited this album for some time. I am extremely happy that this band has seen an increase in popularity here in the US in the last couple of years. This album is truly a marriage of several things I love Thom's voice, ambient type synth sounds, and general oddness. I suggest this album to anyone who loves Radiohead or wants to hear new (good) music! It's not a Pop/Rock album. It's Radiohead moving foward with their music. They are going to the next level as far as experimenting and changing their music. I like all their albums for what they are, but I am so glad they are band that is decidely trying to mature/evolve with their fans. This album is full of beautiful, haunting sounds lush in their execution. Everytime you listen it will become more...
B000000W5N|5.0|What can anyone say about this CD except: BUY IT!  Mick Taylor, perhaps the best guitarist to every play with the Stones, and the rest of the band at their very best.  Whip by Brown Sugar and focus on Mick's Taylor's dazzling lead guitar work throughout the rest of the album.  Simply must have Stones!
B00004XONN|4.0|I have been a fan of Radiohead for years now and I've come to realize that you can never really anticipate what they are gonna give you next.  &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot; were great rock albums with music and lyrics that were somewhat accessible (for Radiohead!) and &quot;OK Computer&quot; branched out from those more traditional rock roots with an experience that transcended any labels like &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;pop.&quot;  &quot;Kid A&quot; is not quite as easy.  The music does not conform to any traditional rock structures and many are sparse or even devoid of lyrical content.  But that just makes the experience of listening to &quot;Kid A&quot; one that you might have to actively participate in.  Understanding and instant gratification aren't likely to come right away but I think that is the whole point of this album.  It is a concept album, no doubt about it...&quot;Kid A&quot; is supposedly a reference to the first human clone which Thom Yorke himself says has probably already happened.  And the album's lack of instant accessibility seems consistent with its theme of lack of participation they are seeing in today's society:  they want you to be actively engaged in listening to this album...it's not going to give up all of its secrets right away.  Despite this fact, there are several tracks which just might hook you from the start:  &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; is hauntingly gorgeous and emotional; &quot;Optimistic&quot; is probably the album's closest resemblance to traditional rock.  In short, this album is a work of art and like most good art, you hear/see something new each time you explore it.
B000003BDJ|5.0|Hot Rocks is definitely a &quot;must have&quot; Stones' collection.  The album tracks their history from their early formative years to the peak of their popularity.  Nothing fancy. Just pure classic rock music.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have been listening to this album for a couple of days, and I am beeing addicted to it. I even got up at night just to listen to &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;. I have become a hardcore Radiohead fan now, I just wished I could have made it to their upcoming concert in Oslo. There is no question wether(is that spelled corectly?) this a five star album, Radiohead is in my opinion the absolute best band for the moment, only Dandy Warhols And Sigur Rs come close
B000003BES|5.0|If you want to hear great songs from one of the best rock bands of all times, this disc is for you!  Every song in this collection is classic Rolling Stones.  If you are a serious Stones' fan, buy this CD for your collection.
B00004XQP4|4.0|What a change. You know the first time I heard manority on the radio, I thought the DJ was drunk and said it was made by Green Day. I was wrong. Green day seems to have taken on a &quot;quieter&quot; and &quot;calmer&quot; tone, but a nice one and kept the same type of touch that greenday has always had with a good touch. Get this cd!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Absolutely electrifying classic rock music!  Jimi at his very best!  If you want anything from Hendrix in your collection, get this disc!
0440236304|5.0|I grew up listening to a friend's dad tell what it was like to be in the 101st Airborne in WWII.  He even showed me the scar on his leg from an 88mm blast that happened on D-Day in Normandy.  &quot;I was diving through the air into a foxhole when I got hit by an 88,&quot; he said--showing me his scar.  &quot;My boot was filled with blood before I hit the ground.&quot;  As I listened to this senior citizen tell me his stories, I wondered what it was like to be a young man and have to fight, get wounded and possibly die for his friends and countrymen.  If by reading Currahee, I only got 10% of what it was like, it is enough to tell me that war is something that should be avoided.  A fantastic book--the second of Burgett's that I've read.  Being originally from Michigan (as well as the author) it was nice hearing him talk about my homestate.  Read this book!
B00004XONN|5.0|As soon as I got out of school today, I headed straight down to the Virgin megastore in Times Square and got this CD. I'd been waiting for october 3rd for weeks, since the first posters were put up on the vacant lot on my corner. Radiohead didn't let me down. The CD is not a regular &quot;rock&quot; CD... the truth is that I can't understand much of what the lead singer is saying, but who cares? The music is great, and that's what really matters.       Much of the music appears to be electronic rather than made by normal instruments, but I cant say for sure. The 8th track, Idioteque, starts out as a modern day techno track with all those artificial sounds but Radiohead can malke somethin as bland as the modern day electronica drum and bass foolishness into something very nice.       It's difficult to say what my favorite track is quite yet, having only listened to the CD once earlier this afternoon and now as I write this review. This CD may not quite be a classic, but it is definitely another knockout performance by Radiohead. In a time of overexposed pop, rap, loud rock, and teen idol meaningless drivel, its nice to know that I can find some beauty and meaning in music of today rather than only listening to the legends of yesterday.
B000002KO1|4.0|This album might be the last great debut album, in straight-ahead rock, formed by musicians who learned more every time they set out to create. Hynde, Chambers, Farndon and Honeyman-Scott only had two albums before the latter two died, and Hynde, reeling from the losses, got back on the motorcycle, assembled a new group with Martin Chambers, and carried on.<br />I feel the musical results have been uneven since Day 1. Whatever I didn't like on this lp, there was a staunch supporter in my face spitting out that song's virtues! Their best was great and their worst can be kicked aside. Although Blondie, Talking Heads, Buzzcocks, Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees and others had begun to unsnarl their anger and mellow their music by the time the Pretenders snapped out this debut album in 1980, that foursome is remembered as being &quot;way back in the day with all them other great dudes&quot; by some of my younger amigos.<br />A certain television channel that mainly broadcasts music videos, commercials &amp; audiovisual-oriented content produced a misnamed &quot;Top 100 Women In Rock&quot; (pardon me if I mis-remember the exact title) for broadcast in 1999. Of the 5 highest ranked women, only Janis Joplin and Chrissie Hynde *rocked*. Chrissie sings, plays, writes, organizes her group, raises her children and still lives, unlike some of her predecessors and co-players. So buy this cd to hear what a LIVING legend loved and hated, loudly and softly, when all of us were that much younger.
B000002UAR|5.0|1966 was a watershed year for pop music. A tremendous sense of invention and inspiration was in the air, and a number of brilliant records, such as the Stones' Aftermath, Dylan's Blonde on Blonde and the Kinks' Something Else showcased major artists at or very near their creative peaks. But the best of the best was certainly Revolver, the Beatles' most diverse and consistent record. This isn't even debatable; it's a fact.  Their unparalleled melodicism and originality reached full flower with songs like For No One; She Said, She Said; Eleanor Rigby; and the psychedelic masterpiece Tomorrow Never Knows, which was unlike anything anyone had heard up to that time.
B000002H2H|4.0|It's like this baby: Metallica helped define thrash metal in the 80s. With Kill 'Em All, they proved that they could play hard, fast, and with reams of energy. However, the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought-out collection of songs. Hetfield's peerless riffing is more refined, and his growling vocals are coming along (he still wasn't too great, though). Hammett's solos are mostly exciting, and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around (in metal). Even Ulrich, whose drumming was always relatively simple, fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge. Metallica has never been too focused on bass, so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he doesn't really get too much attention. He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs, but one thing that's nice about Metallica's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments. (Just a small gripe.)<br />Anyway, this album tells you what Metallica was all about. The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs, &quot;Fade to Black.&quot; It's a great anti-suicide song, that starts with slow, lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy, powerful riffs. It concludes with exhilarating, punchy riffs and a glistening solo. Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide...that's how good it is!<br />&quot;Call of Ktulu&quot;, the big instrumental, is almost symphonic in its interplay (which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&amp;M). &quot;Creeping Death&quot; and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; are heavy, clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs. &quot;Fire Fire with Fire&quot; is mindless thrash with lots of kick. &quot;Trapped under Ice&quot; is tight speed metal.<br />Ride the Lightning isn't as ambitious or complex as Metallica's follow-ups, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. However, most of the songs are great one way or another. Here, Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great, great metal album.s are great one way or another. Here, Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great, great metal album.
B00004XONN|5.0|Simple title because no word can describe this ultimate classic of experimental rock, electronic in its largest sens...<br />Kid A is about 10 times better than Ok Computer which was already one of my fav and one of the best albums of all times i think. The only arguments that could go versus &quot;Ok Computer&quot; brilliance were about the retrospective side of it. Little bit 60's here, little bit 70's there...Never like something already heard in a full tune, but still retro by parts. <br />Of course, if you listened enough you soon discovered that &quot;Ok Computer&quot; was not about nostalgia, but about a really intense &quot;personal vision&quot; of music. Something that innovate as much as revisited the past to turn it inside out...<br />But &quot;Kid A&quot; is more than that! &quot;Kid A&quot; doesn't sound like anything else ever made. You can hear influences like on anything ever made in the history of music (except maybe the Shaggs : crappy/novelty recording of the late 60's), but these are distant sounds like a part of a keyboard line, a part of a string arrangement, etc. <br />Now let's talk about the important parts...&quot;Kid A&quot; push the technology to the point where sounds are always part of a whole, where you can see the difference between a bass and a voice and a rythm and an atonal keyboard line. &quot;Kid A&quot; mess up with &quot;clichés&quot; and always surprise you with a pure sens of creativity that almost feel childish, like a child discovering life and all of his senses. &quot;Kid A&quot; is anti-nostalgia, retrospective, even anti-Ok Computer, yet is able to take the best of it and reinvent it ; like if aliens have listened to &quot;Ok Computer&quot; and came out with their own vision of it... <br />Yet, &quot;Kid A&quot; got that human simplicity where the weirdest parts are catchy on their own terms. It's also structured as a futuristic concept album that follow a very natural progression, a progression that any human can relate to...<br />One of them being Thom Yorke (better than ever on &quot;Kid A&quot;). His lyrics, his emotional status switch through the album. At first, a confuse individual sing in the most intense tracks of the album (&quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot;, &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;National Anthem&quot;). Then, a dreamy indivual show (&quot;I'm not here this isn't happening&quot; sing Thom on &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot;) and even disappear completly on the ambient &quot;TreeFingers&quot;. Back from his fantaisies? &quot;Optimistic&quot; is a very unusual moment for this person, singing &quot;You can try the best you can, you can try the best you can, the best you can is good enough&quot; yet this same track is slowed down and multi-layered guitars, a sound that could, probably express an hesitation in this same statement. &quot;In Limbo&quot; confirm this hesitation with a very dark performance by Thom Yorke, like he just got to a sudden low, his lowest ever, sudden depression after an hesitative positive moment. This track is subdued though. At the end, the leader scream &quot;cry baby!&quot; : maybe like he had enough of his reactions versus confusion and depression, a scream to get to reality? &quot;Idiotheque&quot; is the only uptempo number of &quot;Kid A&quot;, a very ground oriented piece, full of raw emotion and agressive lyrics by the english guy like this reaction to a previous thought : &quot;This is really happening!&quot;. Back to the ground, the underrated genius talk about a very modern problem of real life in &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, saying things like &quot;You can keep the furniture&quot;, &quot;Where did you park the car?&quot; to make references to the problem of divorces and/or the tension related to this same situation (very real life, anti-&quot;Kid A&quot; thematic). It bring us to the final piece where Thom Yorke seem to navigate through elements of every day life yet saying at the very end &quot;i will see you in the nextlife...&quot; making it the perfect end to this amazing emotional trip.<br />&quot;Kid A&quot; is a classic, maybe the best thing i've ever heard...
B00004XONN|5.0|I never really clicked with Radiohead, even when &quot;OK Computer&quot; came around but &quot;Kid A&quot; changed all that. Once this sinks in, you know it is the best album you've heard in a long time. There is so much strangeness, emotion, depth.  Songs like &quot;How to Dissapear Completely&quot;, &quot;Optimistic&quot;, and the longing closing of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; are just so achingly beautiful and soul-touching. Radiohead are definetly trying to tell us something about ourselves here and if you are human, you are bound to be able to relate.
B00004XONN|3.0|I'm not quite sure what Thom york and company had in mind when they took a final listen to Kid A before shipping it off for sale but I can only hope that they felt that they did the best they could. Kid A sounds to me like a whole gaggle of b-sides and studio out takes. The disc seems to lack the power of emotion felt in all previous Radiohead albums. I guess I was hoping to find an emotive stand out in the vain of Paranoid Android or Polyehtylene but what I found was a confusing collection of plod alongs. I hope this is not a case of pompus attitude vs a serious attempt to creat something wonderful but with Radiohead who can tell. As my love for this band pushes me to listen over and over again to this new and confusing record I hope I eventually get the jist but for now I sit with a blank expression on my face wondering where it all went. Ofcouse an oppinion is just that, an oppinion so i'm curious to see how Radiohead fans of the world will warm or recoil from this new musical venture.
B00004XONN|5.0|I believe that &quot;OK Computer&quot; was one of the greatest albums ever.  It took music to new heights and opened up progressive rock to many new faces.  If &quot;OK Computer&quot; was something new and revolutionary, then &quot;Kid A&quot; is the eqivilant of Ralph Nader winning the presidency.  It might take a few listens to really figure out if you bought the right CD or not, but in the end the non-linear beats become more familiar, and the hazy melodies more catching.  I was ready for a break when everyone jumped on the Radiohead bandwagon, but now I can't help but get excited all over again. I wouldn't give a good album five stars.  I would only give a work of significant achievement five stars.  &quot;Kid A&quot; is most definitly that.
B00004XONN|5.0|First, lose all your inhibitions. Second, let yourself go. Third, relax with Kid A. How could you not love this album? With Radioheads latest release, Kid A, they have created an album that is nothing short of spectacular. You have to release yourself however, you cannot look at this album like OK Computer, you have to accept change. Exploding on the scene with &quot;everything in its right place&quot;, and moving on to the melodicly enchanting &quot;National Anthem&quot;, and finally closing the book with &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, Radiohead has concoted a wonderfull album. Looking for somthing other then the average crap, somthing that will catch your attention, and keep you coming back for more, then look no further, BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00004XQP4|4.0|I'm one of the few Green Day fans that liked Nimrod more than Dookie. I bought this album hoping that it would be better that both. I can't say the album follows up to Nimrod, but it is definitely better than Dookie. There are more good songs than not, but I doubt any will be played on the radio any time soon.......
B00004XQP4|4.0|It's good, really good. The only problem is it's such a different style, it's a very likeable style,but the side of me that wants angry ranting is not very happy with this album.
B000001FV1|5.0|I enjoy the music on this CD very much.  It is jazz-influenced rock 'n roll from 1973.  Steve Winwood and the band perform tight but loose extended sets.  Winwood's guitar is prominent and I like that.  Even so, the rest of the band is great.  This CD starts out upbeat with the title cut, slows down a bit with ROLL RIGHT STONES becomes mellow with EVENING BLUE, melancholy with TRAGIC MAGIC, and with UNINSPIRED, nearly approaches the goth-rock of the early eighties.  TRAFFIC makes feeling sad feel good. If you are interested in jazz/rock of the early seventies, this CD will interest you.
B00004XONN|5.0|yeah, its just pretty good. Excellent arrangements although honestly not for everyone and some fans from &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer might be a bit confused on where the band was headed with this album. It isn't as overly rock oriented as the previous albums but when listening to it, you aren't too concerned with that. The guitars are there for those of you that are worried that Thom completely wrote them off, and they are good. &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; is the masterpiece of the album in my opinion as it has great vocals and good guitar work. &quot;Idioteque&quot; and &quot;In Limbo&quot; are two of the other highlights as Yorke's voice works really well to the backdrop of the melodies. Its got a bit of horn playing in &quot;The National Anthem&quot; and some of the other songs appear to have enough electronica influence that they could be re-mixed into dance versions, which would be very interesting to see. They're return is apparent and its awesome. For those of you that know about them, I don't need to say anything else, so i'll just shut-up now and keep listening to the album.
B00004XONN|4.0|This album is the most adventurous popular music CD I've ever heard.  It takes a little getting used to, particularly the long instrumental cuts, but worth the effort in my opinion.  The sound is eerie, atonal and sonically bleak, but it's also engaging.  I particularly like that the use of computerized vocals does not sound overproduced like so much commercial music today.  Also the organ that underpins almost every cut gives the music great depth.  Lead singer Yorke's vocals are actually a bit thin at times (for instance &quot;Idioteque&quot;), and the lyrics are even more obscure, at least to me.  If all you've heard is &quot;Creep&quot; you may not go for this, but if you're on board for the Radiohead ride then just get prepared for a little stranger trip.
B00004XONN|5.0|I've never heard anything like this album.  It's been on continuous play in my CD player for about six hours now and I won't be turning it off any time soon.  Sure, Kid A sounds nothing like OK Computer or the Bends, but it is still undeniably Radiohead, and by definition they can do no wrong.  Still, I don't think anyone expected anything half as mind-blowing as this.  Kid A simply defies descrption.  Get it.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a wonderful book that helps us remember what is truly important. Loes Lowry is a master storyteller who paints a picture of a Utopian world in which everyone is confident and happy but a chosen few. Is this the only way that we can truly be free of our modern problems? The story of the giver is nearly as sad as it is compelling.
B00004XONN|5.0|Flip through the local modern rock stations in your area. It's been a while since music execs have fed the public such tired, uninventive fodder. Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Eminem, the nearly classic rock Nirvana track and the same ridiculous Beastie Boys songs they've been playing for 14 years (at least play something from Ill Communications for crying out loud!) Now turn of your radio and order Kid A. <br />Kid A is difficult, self-indulgant, experimental and most likely disappointing to fans of Radiohead's first hit &quot;Creep.&quot; They've killed the guitars in favor of organs, horns and break-beats. They locked themselves in the studio with Miles Davis and DJ Shadow, and emerged with a sterile, alienating album named after the first cloned child. There are several brilliant tracks -- check out Idioteque, the title track and How to Disappear... for example. Many reviewers will characterize the album as Orwellian space-opera about a cold future. But let the album get under your skin, and there's a feeling that it's a lot more about the present than you think. In fact it might be more about YOU than anything Limp and Em have to say.
B00004XONN|3.0|This is a good album.  Kid A does continue in the direction the previous three releases have laid down, I just think that this one may have been a bit to &quot;Head&quot; and not enough &quot;Radio&quot;.
B00004Z511|5.0|Taking OK Computer to the next extreme Kid A is music for the mind.  It's more like an album with pauses than a collection of songs.  Don't expect any of the rock aspects of the bends just let yourself sit in a room and take it in from beginning to end.
0385484518|4.0|This book was not what I expected. It really moved me. In ways I didn't expect. It reveals compassion, change, acceptance and most important, the need to feel. I would recommend this book to anyone who could use a little nudge when it comes to reality and what is really important. Aside from the core issue, dying, this is about living. It was well written, easy to follow and held my attention for a few nights. This is not just about losing and finding again. It is about life.
B00004XONN|5.0|Take OK Computer, filter out the guitars, bring in a few new freaky keyboards to make an album filled with raw human emotions oozing through your speakers.  Kid A is music for the mind.  It's more like an album with pauses than a collection of songs.  Don't expect any of the rock aspects of the bends, just let yourself sit in a room and take it in from beginning to end.
B000002LIX|5.0|So many bands have tried to rekindle the glory days of Led Zeppelin. All have failed. All, except for one. There was this one band called Jane's addiction that almost made it to the mainstream. They recaptured everything good about Led Zeppelin and put it into their albums. And they did it without trying to sound like them. The power, creativity, and incredible musicianship that made zeppelin so great is what makes jane's addiction so wonderful. Ritual could definitely be in the top 20 of the 1990s, maybe top ten. It is one of my favorite albums of all time.
0140157352|5.0|We often tend to apply the terms communication &amp; negotiation to the business environment.  We often forget that we communicate with our family, peers &amp; relatives as well. But do we really? <br />Had I read this book decades ago, maybe my mother had allowed me to attend the several parties I have missed out during my teen-age years.  Now, I have my daughter &amp; mhy husband to practice on.  &amp; hopefully, the communicating/negotiating skills listed here in this book will enrich my relationship with my family.
1853260444|5.0|I picked this book up in France after not having read an English book for two weeks, because I thought I would be desparate enough to work through it.  Much to my surprise, it has become among my ten or so favorite books (out of--well, out of a lot more than that).  The plot is intricate and well-planned, and the characters much funnier--consider the downfall of the evangelical cousin--and more humanly sympathetic than those of Collins' contemporary Dickens--there are NO Little Nells here, and the book is better for it.
B00004XQP4|3.0|I had waited many a week, anticipated eagerly, and, well, I got &quot;Warning&quot;. Despite reading several relatively mediocre reviews, I couldn't wait to buy this CD, having loved &quot;Dookie&quot; and &quot;Nimrod&quot;. Listening to &quot;Warning&quot;, however, I realized that the above is probably not the reason to go out and get it. Because the feeling I had, upon listening to this CD, was something along the lines of, &quot;Sounds like Billie Joe Armstrong...Sure says 'Green Day' on the  box...but...but who is this?&quot;<br />      Now, let me just clarify that I was far from disappointed. The songs are catchy, and I'm sure that this CD will grow on me, as many do. But it lacks the energy that I associate with Green Day, the stuff that got me jumping around my room, and, I assume, people who can dance, dancing. Everything that I've read has described this as the coming-of-age of Green Day, referrring to the lyrics, in which, to quote Rolling Stone, Billie Joe has &quot;shifted his perspective to the world outside his basement&quot; (pg. 90, 10-12). But somehow that's not what got to me. Call me sentimental, but I miss the good ol' days in which Tré Cool's drums were not banished to the background. If maturity means losing this much of your spirit, I'm not looking forward to my fourteenth birthday.<br />     The only song which, in my first few listenings caught me as trademark Green Day was &quot;Minority&quot;, which I had already heard on the radio, and downloaded (courtesy of Napster). The song &quot;Warning&quot;, while not what I'd call quintessential, is probably going to be stuck in my head for the foreseeable future. And there are several others that I can see growing on me.<br />      So, buy &quot;Warning&quot; out of loyalty to the band, if you want to see what direction they're headed. Buy it if you heard some previews on the radio and fell in love with them. But don't buy it because&quot;Dookie&quot; is your favorite CD. And if you do, likeme, prepare to have your expectations severely messed with.
B00004XONN|5.0|Is this album for everyone? Not really.  But if you are a fan of Radiohead deeply, and emotionally, it is equal to their past masterpieces.  The album flows with various landscapes of sounds, textures, almost ambient.  I am a huge guitar fan,this album is missing that element at most points.  Being the guitar lover I am, Im not dissapointed at all!  Radiohead is special!  This is one of the best follow-up albums of the last 5 years, after Ok Computer.  Kid A is an A+..But friend be open-minded, and you will see what many see. Brilliance!
B00004XONN|5.0|Thank you Radiohead for defying convention, for defying the numbing radio-friendly boy-band pop that has inundated our society, for defying everything your legions of fans thought you were about, and for being the only band that is not afraid to be utterly original.  This record is brilliant and unexpected and completely surprising.  Whatever you may think upon your first exposure to this album, listen again and again and you will be rewarded with the depth and unnerving instability that defines this amazing disc.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This is by far my favorite CD this year.  I put it in my CD player and haven't taken it out in weeks.  ATDI's &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; is powerful, yet it is not overbearing like some hardcore.  Musically I have not seen any comparison to this in a long time. This is a definite must have!

B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning is the 6th Green Day CD I've purchased and they keep getting better and better!  The songs have depth that some previous albums didn't have, both musically and lyrically.  If you even remotely enjoy Green Day, buy this album!  You will not be disappointed.
B00004XONN|4.0|A couple thoughts on the album after 3 listens...<br />Reinvention #1:  Musical Focal Point<br />I'm amazed at how vocally centered Kid A seems to be. Everything seems to serve the vocal's lyric and vision.  This would be in opposition to everything servicing the song, the energy of rock music, or even the existing instrumentation of the band. The paradox is that although it seems vocal driven, the lyrics are some of the most indiscernible and obscured I've heard.<br />Reinvention #2:  Live vs. Studio<br />Judging by the mp3s of live shows, they seem to make a significant delineation between the live performance and the studio recordings of their songs.<br />Reinvention #3:  Discography Consistency<br />I would have never thought of Ok Computer as a transition album but given the changes on Kid A, I'm tempted to think that.  However, everything Radiohead has done has sounded like a transition album because each album is so progressively different.  I think this demonstrates a restlessness I've not heard another musician(s) attain. (If U2 had consistently raised/changed the bar as they did from Joshua Tree to Achtung Baby, they would be a contender)<br />Reinvention #4:  Reviewability<br />It seems like Radiohead has changed the rules on album content so much that reviews should cease to discuss whether it is a good or bad album (or simply how good it is) and (should) move on to an analysis of the ideas of the content.  (Unlike a band like U2 or REM where there is constant discussion as to whether they have lost it, or are no longer relevant).  The reality though is that in rock criticism, we're really only equipped to discuss whether something is cool, rocks, what it references, what it develops, or what have you.  Rock music typically hasn't generated good enough work to a)warrant such analysis or b)give us a chance to practice real criticism, though there are definitely exceptions.<br />Other thoughts...<br />Although I wouldn't wish Radiohead have pursued anything other than what they did in creating this record, I do harbor a secret desire for a few more tangible songs like the ones on OK Computer.  On a similar note, I'd give Sgt. Pepper 4/5 Stars because I don't like &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; or &quot;Within Without You&quot; all that well.<br />Thank you.
B00004XONN|4.0|radiohead's new album is unlike anything released this year.a brilliant headphone journey that charts the birth, life and death of a surreal, but very human character: kid a. from the conception themed &quot;everything in right place&quot;, the birth of kid a at the end of the title track (witness the breathtaking sound effect at 4:24),the adolescent to teenage angst of &quot;national anthem&quot;  (as kid a attempts to find his voice in this world, drowned out by synthesizers, and finally bursting into his own, trumpted by a fanfare of acid jazz horns at the track's close). 20-something depression: how to disappear completely 30's melancholy:treefingers mid-life crisis: the trilogy of &quot;optimistic&quot;, &quot;in limbo&quot;, &quot;idioteque&quot; (in &quot;optimistic&quot; it appears kid a might have a child of their own or a spouse &quot;if you tried the best you can, the best you can, is good enough&quot; he sings over and over. in &quot;idioteque&quot;-innevitable divorce:&quot;go on take the furniture&quot;) by &quot;morning bell&quot; kid a warns of a &quot;ice age coming&quot;, &quot;leave me, leave me&quot; he pleas, and finally a realization of death &quot;this is really happening&quot; which directly conflicts with kid a's earlier beliefs in &quot;how to disappear completely&quot; (&quot;i'm not here,this isn't happening&quot;) the ultimate death of kid a happens in &quot;motion picture soundtrack&quot;, a solemn organ opens the track, with what sounds like a rocking chair creaking somewhere in the distance. here is when we hear the ruminations of a dying man &quot;cheap sex, and sour films- helped me get rid of it all&quot;. the introduction of heavenly harps and kid a's introspective lyrics &quot;it's not like the movies, they fed us on little white lies&quot; helps us to understand his point of view at his passing.<br />his last words: &quot;i will see you in the next life&quot; as harps drift on, perhaps pulling kid a into his final moments....a lapse  of time as our character dies...and then brilliantly at 4:18 we hear what can only be described as sonic ascension....and it's assumed that kid a, through all his hardship and willful abandon has made it to heaven...<br />a great album, a brillaint journey...defintely one of my favorite albums of the year...a must buy!
B00004XONN|5.0|Lovely and appropriately melancholic, Radiohead has really outdone themselves with this disc. <br />Once again they sound like no one else out there, though I'm sure a new round of imitators won't be far behind.<br />It's a pleasure to behold (and to listen to).<br />My other discs will be gathering dust 'til I wear this one out.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is such an amazingly beautiful complex and transcendent work. The rhythms and textures escalate into such a tremendous anti-structure and everything here makes such sense. Haunting, gorgeous and cut like concrete.
B00003CX97|4.0|This is a WWII classic movie.  Very well done.  Excellent story line and character development.  The days of good movies and good actors.  This is one of those movies that we refer to when we say, &quot;they don't make 'em like they used to&quot;.  A worthy movie for anyone's collection.
B00004XONN|5.0|When it comes to Radiohead, you have to keep in mind that they are a band that believes in evolving.  Even if it means alienating some fans and critics alike.  It should be no surprise to anyone that the band has taken an even greater step than it did with the release of OK Computer.  People who like the Radiohead that realesed Pablo Honey will find this album difficult and perhaps even weird.  Those who claim that The Bends is their best album, will be looking for the guitar elements that defined that album, but will come up empty handed.  Those however, who embraced OK Computer for the great risk it took and courage to go against &quot;the buzz&quot; of alternative radio as Thom Yorke calls it, will find something worth listening to.  It is easily conceivable that many people will instantly dislike the album, simply because it does not sound like everything else out there.  Perhaps when the U.S. music world becomes less dominated by corporate promotion and radio play, then this album might find the respect it deserves.  This is not an album meant to change the world, not by any means, but simply an album that stands for the evolution of a band that refuses to be taimed by the record industry.  Anyway, I believe the music speaks for itself.  Listen to it all the way through a couple of times and see for yourself.
B00004XONN|5.0|Where to start?  I just bought this CD today, and it's already another wonderful collection to all of my Radiohead albums.  From start to finish (as that's the only honest way to listen to this musical piece) this album is an experimental winner.  Where Pablo Honey is the root of Radiohead's vocal &quot;anguish through elequence&quot;, The Bends is &quot;maturity through emotion&quot;, and Ok Computer is &quot;wisdom through perfect musical creativity&quot;, Kid A stands as the groups' album of &quot;curiosity and hope through confusion and abandonment&quot;.  Those expecting another Bends or Ok Computer will joy over the continued musicality and emotional brilliance; however, be forewarned that the sound ventures into more  romantic subtlety than blatant passion.  I have been a Radiohead fan for sometime now, and I feel as the band's sound matures and develops into ever-changing physicalities, so will my love and respect for the group.  If you are not quite sure about Radiohead, and are only mildly interested in the group . . . I would suggest going to a record store or friend and listening to it for yourself first to see if you appreciate the budding sound.  If you feel that you are a strong fan, tolerant to musical change with experimentation, I say &quot;grab it fast&quot;.  You WILL NOT regret it.
B000001FS3|5.0|With the release of this album, U2 forever became my favorite rock and roll band of all time.  Nearly 14 years and 11 million copies sold later, each and every song on this album moves me like no other complete album has ever been able.  The sound of this album is one that is truly timeless.  From the quiet, inviting organs that fade in to open Where the Streets Have No Name until the faux-techno synthesizer that fades to silence to close out Mothers of the Disappeared (and the album) over 50 minutes later, each tune grabs the listener and pounds them through a beautiful and exhilerating musical experience.  Bono's voice delivers his lyrics of longing, love, and loss, and even those tunes that advertise U2's political commentary do so with polite and subtle tact.  But just as Bono's lyrics grab you, the edgy guitars and deep wanting bass lines provided by Edge and Adam Clayton stab you, while Larry Mullen's drums get your chest thumping, and your feet stomping.  There is not a throw-away on this album, I promise you.  This is a quintessential musical masterpiece, and a must for any music collection.
6304595247|5.0|I just want to say that I have never cried so much while watching a film, or re-played a theme song from a movie in my mind as much as Wuthering Heights. Juliette Binoche is so amazing. If you are an insensitive block of metal then I do not recommend Wuthering Heights, but how can you resist simply bursting into tears throughout this entire movie. Maybe I am just appreciating this because it provokes my emotions, but isn't that what film is supposed to do, rape your mind?
B00004XONN|5.0|This is a very different album from previous Radiohead releases. But this album was also not a surprise. OK Computer forecasted this release with its experimental sound. OK Computer contained more guitar and conventional instruments that Kid A, which has put some people off of the new LP. There is no way to give a proper review of Kid A as everyone's opinions are definately going to clash. All I will say is that you will have to make your own mind up and don't let others' word stop you from buying this album.<br />Personally I like it, but that shouldn't make any difference to whether you like it or not. Give the album a go.
B00004XONN|2.0|Experimentation is great. But this sounds too much like we've dropped in on a selection of ideas that remain half formed.It's as if Radiohead have put out a work in progress. There are a couple of really good songs, but too many drift by. If any up &amp; coming local band did this you'd think - &quot;lovely! - err.. got any tunes?&quot; Given the build-up? Disappointing. Next?
0684853523|5.0|This book is both entertaining and informative. What else coul you ask for? What are you doing still reading this review? Go buy the book already.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is the kind of records that you must listen to many times to esteem its value, but that everyone know it. I have a theory: If a album don't like you at the first lisentening then there will be a 99% of possibilities that record become a masterpiece. That's the case of OK Computer, in my opinion, the best record of the 90's, and maybe, one of the best records of the history of contemporary music. It's obvious the influence of the seventies' Floyd and King Crimson (i.e.: compare Exit Music vs. In The Court of Crimson King), but Radiohead goes beyond, because the well use of new technologies and the capacity of Radiohead to compose great moments of tension and build dark atmospheres. If you like Pink Floyd, buy it now, and forget about Division Bell and the last PF albums. If you don't like Pink Floyd buy it also.
0783243499|1.0|Utterly horrible movie with no logical plot or progression.  The acting is laughable with Patrick talking in the same tone of voice during the entire movie. The writing is childish with some of the most hilariuosly bad scenes I have ever seen. The ending was the final draw in an already bad movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!
B00004XONN|5.0|First off, this is NOT OK Computer 2. This is the next evolution of Radiohead. &quot;Treefingers&quot; did vaguely remind me of some of the material from the Airbag/How Am I Driving EP, but little else reminded me specifically of anything they've done before. The band has taken yet another huge step away from &quot;contemporary rock,&quot; whatever that may be these days. There are only a few songs that contain sounds immediately recognizable as guitars. Things seem much less clear-cut here than on OK Computer. There's a density to the sound on this album that I've only seen before from Nine Inch Nails. Not that the two bands sound anything alike, it's just that NIN is the only band I can think of that has the same number and diversity of sounds all happening at once. Kid A's sound is also quite a bit darker than OKC's. It's my personal belief that everyone on the planet Earth (and even those who aren't, if you're reading this) should own this album, but realistically, here's my recomendation: If you have more than a passing interest in Radiohead, BUY THIS CD NOW. If you're a big fan, it may hook you on the first listen, for some, though, it may take a few. It is worth it. Your patience will be rewarded. I've only listened once, and based on my past Radiohead experience, I only expect it to get better with repeated listenings.
0811826848|5.0|Just got the &quot;Anthology&quot; yesterday, and let me throw a few words at you:<br />Hefty. Dense. Comprehensive.<br />Pictures?  It's crammed with them.<br />Is it readable?  While most books made up of interview quotes can be frustratingly Helter Skelter, the quotes in &quot;Anthology&quot; are edited so that the book flows in a highly readable narrative style.<br />I feared that this book might be a cheap cashing-in.  Rather, it's a beautifully mammoth effort.
B00004Z511|5.0|Radiohead has always lost fans when they release a new album, but they also gain new fans...those of us who have followed their brilliance since the early days of Pablo Honey and are still around for Kid A know that radiohead will never stay the same...if they do I will stop listening...there are no words to describe this album...the attention to detail is enormous...if you haven't found the little booklet yet you'll be even more amazed after you read it...take a chance and listen to this album...definaltely not for everyone...but astounding nonetheless...
0684853523|5.0|This is one of best books on writing I've read, and I've read most of them. King tells the truth and the story is interesting to read, even if you're not a writer. If you are a writer, he sticks his boot up your but, but, but and picks you up again with advice you can actually use. (Advice about the tools you need, how to get an agent, and how to take your writing seriously.) My favorite quote:  &quot;You must not come lightly to the blank page.&quot;  So, don't waste any more time.  Buy the book, read it and write.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna's new album Music is one of the best CDs I have bought in a long time.  It has a techno sound to it, as most have already heard on the title track &quot;Music&quot; which gets a lot of radio airplay.  This is music that makes me want to get up and dance.  <br />There are also a few ballads on here that are very well-written.  I didn't particularly care for the vocoder usage in &quot;Nobody's Perfect.&quot;  It made a beautiful ballad sound too electronic.<br />&quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is a great song, and it sounds a lot like older Madonna music.  &quot;I Deserve It&quot; is another favorite.  It is a very deep ballad with very moving lyrics.<br />I would definitely recommend buying this CD even if you don't normally buy Madonna's albums.
B00000J2KR|4.0|The great Stanley Kubrick was a bit of a cinematic chameleon.  None of his films looked anything like the next one.  For the most part, they were all of different film genres and generally set a standard for that particular genre.  Barry Lyndon, then, is Stanley Kubrick's take on the historical costume genre.  Over the years, unfortunately, people have come to regard this film as lesser Kubrick, not up to par with 2001 or Dr. Strangelove.<br /> When I first saw Barry Lyndon in college, I must admit I thought the film was a little long and somewhat boring.  But something about the film nevertheless fascinated me.  A year back, I decided, on a whim, to purchase the Barry Lyndon DVD and re-watch this film.  I'm glad I did.<br /> Yes, Barry Lyndon is almost 3 hours long, and Kubrick's deliberate, methodical pacing will dearly try the patience of those of us weaned on fast MTV-style editing.  Yet, the film is glorious to watch.  The cinematography of the film is absolutely breath-taking.  In countless scene after scene, Kubrick has created images that, if paused on your DVD player, could easily pass for a period painting of the era.  The film is *that* beautiful.  And he created a special lens that was able to photograph in natural light and candle light - not a great feat nowadays but an astounding achievement 25 years ago when this film was created.  The film won a well-deserved Oscar for cinematography, as well as for costume design and art direction and musical scoring.  As far as the Academy Awards are concerned, this is probably Kubrick's most decorated film.<br /> The plot follows the rise and fall of one Redmond Barry and how he achieves great wealth and power only to lose it all by the end of the film.  Ryan O'Neil is Redmond Barry, and while some people may scoff at this casting choice, he does a decent job in the role.  Marisa Berenson, regarded in the 1970s as an international beauty, portrayed the Countess Lyndon whom Redmond Barry marries for wealth.<br />There are numerous stand-out scenes in the film, thanks to Kubrick's perfectionist strive.  The gun-duels, especially the last one, are suspenseful and superbly filmed.  The battle scenes, while sterile and blood-less in comparison to recent films like The Patriot or Braveheart, are well-done.  And the romance scenes (in a Kubrick film? But yes!) are sweet or amusing or lustful, depending on Kubrick's intentions.  The great thing about a DVD is that it allows you to watch your favorite scene over and over again, and Barry Lyndon is a film filled with scenes that can be appreciated in such a fashion.<br /> Now...a word about the Warner Brothers DVD.  Warner Brothers has gotten a lot of grief about the haste with which they produced these Kubrick DVDs in the wake of the director's death.  Most are bare-bones and don't have the best transfers, to be polite.  Such is the case with the Barry Lyndon DVD.  The DVD includes only from production notes, a trailer, subtitles, and a list of awards.  That's about it.  And the image quality, while certainly better than VHS, is not as good as it could have been.  In other words, Warner Brothers transfered a decent print but made NO effort to restore it.  The DVD still looks good, but it could have looked a LOT better, too.  The sound is monophonic, as Kubrick usually preferred, so that's what you get on the DVD.  Still, I think Warner Brothers could have put in some effort, like was done with the restoration for Vertigo DVD for example, and produced a really high quality DVD.  Kubrick is one of our greatest directors; he deserved better treatment.<br /> Anyways, so the film is great, but the DVD is so-so.  At least it's a budget DVD.  If you enjoy this film, you may either purchase it cheaply now....or wait indefinitely until Warner Brothers decides to produce a special edition of Barry Lyndon in the inconceivable future.
B00004XQP4|3.0|I thought that I was gonna hear some good stuff from green day now, but I didn't expect to hear this.  There's not punk at all on this album, it's basically folk-alternative.  With the exception of minority and blood, sex, and booze, the album isn't that great.  Don't buy this album expecting the same green day that put out insomniac or dookie.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A-the much anticipated follow up to Radiohead's OK Computer-is a fine and worthy release from this band.  OK Computer was not only a major achievement for the group, but also the best album of the 90's.  So, how do you follow that up?  The group have decided to go against the grain and have released a daring and adventurous album.  Kid A harks back to the days when rock groups made &quot;albums&quot; and not &quot;singles&quot;.  Everything about the record is unconventional.  Kudos to Radiohead, this is refreshing in this commercial driven world.  Kid A is experimental in the best sense, arty, dense, elegant, and endlessly listenable.  No single track stands out, it has been designed to be listened to in a single sitting. In calling this a concept album, the group continues to convey a sense of alienation and dislocation in the world with their songs.  Radiohead have constructed some of the most beautiful soundscapes on KID A.  This is an album you put on, turn out the lights and just lay back and let it wash over you.  I think a lot of people will be surprised by this record.  There are hardly any guitars on it, keyboards, harps, unusual sounds from another galaxy dominate.  In fact, it takes about a few listens to really absorb it all.  Radiohead have again made the case that they are now the finest rock group currently at work.
0140185232|5.0|I first read The Razor's Edge when I was 11, when a great deal of its depth, (not to mention a great deal about Isabel's lust, and Sophie's downfall), must have gone right over my head. I've read it several times since. I suppose it was Larry's search for meaning in life after his war experiences that intrigued me the first time, and stayed with me. But as I go through life I more fully understand the parallels between Larry and the other characters. Each of them has hardship and loss in their lives. They handle it according to their abilities, and carry on. His search through mysticism with its ultimate peace of mind was one way of coping. The others, on completely different paths, also find what they're searching for. None of them are without faults and they do not always behave well, but the beauty in the book is that their behavior is always rational for their circumstances. The author displays enormous compassion and does not pass moral judgment on them or impose fictitious punishment. It's a character-driven story, and it's a story that we all, in one form or another, live.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day's Dookie was a record that has, to this point, never been paralleled by any band.  That is my opinion.  It was a release of pure talent.<br />When Insomniac came out - I was moderately pleased.  Nimrod had only a few tracks I really loved.  I wasn't expecting Warning.<br />Warning is an excellent CD.  The music reflects more of the &quot;Insomniac&quot; sound in my opinion.  In fact, in one of the songs, I thought I had was LISTENING to insomniac.<br />Macy's Day Parade is one of my favourite songs.  It isn't electric, but has a truly absorbing melody.<br />This is a MUST buy for any Green Day fan.  In fact, everyone should buy this CD.<br />Great work Green Day!
B000002UB6|5.0|This album has always recieved much criticism for its 'overproduction' and its deviation from the original plan for it.In my opinion, Phil Spector did a fine job with this album.Considering that the Beatles were at each others throats  and rarely even appeared in the studio toward the end, I think Spector did fine.First and foremost, I'd say that 'The Long and Winding Road' benefited the most from Spectors 'wall of sound' production techniques.To a lesser extent,I feel that 'Across the Universe' also did.The biggest downside of the album for me was that some of the songs are just partial and very short.I still think this is a fine album and a different look at the Beatles from their previous work.
B0000042MY|4.0|Where should I start.  The music is a very beautiful selection that fits the movie perfectly. I agree with many of the othe reviews. It is an awesome movie/soundtrack. If you haven't seen the movie, or read the book, I recommend reading the book, and then watching the movie, becuz the book is so much deeper.  If fact, the movie is only about 1/3 of the book, and the movie portrays the characters differently then what is in the book.  This CD is a wonderful buy, so I hope this helped
0679746048|2.0|I would first like to say that I have not seen the movie that was based on this book, and I am not judging it in relation to the movie.  Girl, Interrupted is a memoir of a young woman who was committed to a mental institution after just one session with a psychologist.  What I did not understand was why, after only one session, she allowed this stranger to shove her into a taxi and commit herself to an institution. It started off well, involving different people who were in the institution and things they did, but further into the book Kaysen started trying to be a psychologist herself.  I did not want a psychology lesson, I wanted more information about what went on in the institution itself. She was in there for quite a while, and yet there isn't much about her life in the hospital. I can see how the movie would be a lot better since the viewers would be spared a tedious psychology lesson.
B00004XQP4|5.0|In a word...WOW!  That was my only thought after hearing this record from start to finish.  Normally a person would pop in their Green Day CD when they're pissed off about something and want someone to be pissed off with, because you always knew lead singer Billie Joe Amrstrong would be much more angry than you.  And during those long-drive sing-alongs, you would begin to understand just how good Green Day is musicly.  Most people can't tell just how good the song-writing, lyrics, and execution of a Green Day song is because it all comes at you so fast.  That's why after hearing a Green Day song over and over, your brain can start to pick it apart and you can then see how good the songs are.  Not with Warning though...   Warning is an absolute showcase of Green Day's talent packaged in very easy-to-swallow tablets, 12 of them actually.  After one listen you too with be left with one thought...WOW!  So buy the CD, take 12 tablets and call me in the morning, you won't be disappointed.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This third studio album continues the progression of the band into more subtle, ambient, electronic experimentation. The mood of the cd moves from low grade paranoia to euphoria to utter indifference. It's definitely something that needs to be experienced, and can't be accurately described. It needs to be listened to in entirety at least 7 times before one can get a handle on the music.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I went out and bought this cd the day of its release. I cannot stop listening to it. It's awesome. I cannot even begin to tell you all how great it is. I love Green Day and I love this album. My favourite songs are &quot;Blood, Sex and Booze&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Minority&quot;, &quot;Deadbeat Holiday&quot; and &quot;Waiting.&quot; ....On second thought, I love them all. BUY IT AND BUY IT NOW. That is all.
052594527X|3.0|Begin with the haunting painting by Vermeer, add to that an imagined tale of how the painting came to be and you have Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier. The story begins with a basic plot line of poor girl who must stoop to a lower station in life, but with rich detail of the times to flesh out the story, the tale unwinds in a fascinating way.  As the reader slips through the first-person narrative, the home where the poor girl lives comes alive with characters who if not unique, are distinctly drawn and easily imagined in the reader's imagination. Although the story bogs down into all too expected developments in the middle of the book, hang on. The end of the story is worth the reader's while to learn how and why the painting might have come to pass. And the multi-faceted meaning of a pearl earring.
0792838785|2.0|Firstly, allow me to say that I love the video game.  That being established, I can go on to write the rest of this review.  Granted, I'm probably not the most qualified person to be writing this as I actually fell asleep in the theatre . . . even with THX.  I actually find histology more engaging than I found this movie, which is pretty amazing considering how damn boring histology is.  The funny thing is that when I woke up, realizing the inappropriatness of drooling in a public place, I hadn't missed a thing.  In a nutshell, James Bond has a buch of gadgets, he blows stuff up, drinks some martinis, has some sex and then saves the day.  Actually, even the sex was bad.  How can anyone do a sex scene without nudity?  I mean without nudity, all you've really got is weird sounds.   If this review helps one person to not watch this movie, I will feel satisfied.  The only reason this movie didn't get one star was because that one star is reserved for THE worst movie ever made - Michael.
0395759242|4.0|King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild is a must-read for anyone who has ever questioned the myth versus the reality of any subject. In the style of a who-dunnit, the intrigue and hypocrisy of King Leopold of Belgium is detailed in a fascinating, page-turning way. From the discovery of who the famous explorer Stanley really was, to what the colony of the Congo was really set up to be, Hochschild spins a tale of (as he so succinctly puts it) &quot;...Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa.&quot;   Anyone who ever thought that globalization was invented in this century would find the book well worth reading, if only to learn how globalized our world has been for centuries. Hochschild has sought out and gathered under one cover historical documents from those who were there, including the usually forgotten Africans who were disenfranchised of their land and all too often, their freedom and lives.  If more history was written in this enthralling manner, reminiscent of Daniel Yergen's monumental opus The Prize (The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power), perhaps there would be more interest in history as a good read, rather than something you study in school.
6305718903|3.0|I was expecting a lot more of this movie. It had the chance to be a movie in line with The Exorcist, Omen, The Seventh Sign, &amp; God's Army, but fails. I'm irritated - It's like having a Royal flush and dont know what to do with it! The suspence is on the same level from beginning to the end, it doesn't get more borring and it doesn't get more exiting and suddenly it's over... The 3 stars is because Gabriel Burne playes fantastic (as allways) and also Arquette is good. The filming, editing, sound and effects are truely great.  I don't understand all you that gives it 5 stars???  Try taking the 6 &amp; 7 stigmata scenes out - what is left? A borring movie with a good point...
B000002UB3|1.0|Rich guys puttering! Who needs it?
B00004XONN|5.0|Unbelievable!  is how I must begin my review since a more correct expression escapes me in describing this album. This review is intended primarily to lovers of classic rock; Pink Floyd, Led Zep, Beatles, etc. who may be deciding whether all the hype about this album, and Radiohead in general, is really warrented. I first bought OK computer because I heard of its similarities to Pink Floyd material (my favorite group). PF and Radiohead make album-long experiences as opposed individual singles, and are flush with emotional lyrics and sounds for mood. If it helps, I feel PF is Jack Nicklaus, and Radiohead Tiger Woods. I'm not willing to say that Radiohead is the best ever, yet, but OKC and Kid A are just about as good as Dark Side of the Moon and Wish you were here, and if they keep this pace they will be the best band EVER. I really think that they are creating the new direction music will take. You dont just hear their music, you feel it. Amazing!  My only regret with buying Kid A is that, seriously, all other music has become almost boring to me, with the exception of the Floyd. But Led Zep, the Doors, Beatles, you name it, sounds generic now. So I've got about $1,000 worth of boring sounding music, thanks to Radiohead's OKC and Kid A. Which one is better? Kid A. Just pure emotion and accompanying sounds to provide a mood that make the listener empathize with Yorkes disturbing voice. I've nothing more to say, I'm still reeling. But regardless of your tastes in music, I don't think that anyone could pick this cd up and deny that it is at least the most inventive compilation of music since Dark Side of the Moon, and so I can give no higher praise.
B00004XONN|4.0|Bravo.  A sharp right turn straight out into the middle of nowhere.  What else is there to do when your last 2 albums are being hailed as 2 of &quot;the top 5 greatest albums of all times&quot; (according to a Virgin Record poll which showed up everywhere from Billboard to CNN)?  Radiohead was at the point where they could have sneezed out the digital leftovers from OK computer and scored 4 1/2 - 5 stars just on the merit that they ARE radiohead.     I'm just curious to see where this goes next: is this the 'pablo honey' of the next set of albums to come out along the same lines?, is this a one shot experimental deal?, what will happen when they get restless with this path as they did with the more straight forward 'rock' path?   Well, I say just let them do whatever they want, because well we may argue over which of their albums is better, few will argue that they are complacent, boring albums resting on the laurels of the ones previous.
0811826848|5.0|I was astonished with the release of Anthology (the CDs). And I really thought that was going to be the last effort of the surviving Beatles together. But here we are now, with this awesome book, with photographs never seen and what is the best, their own words explaining the real stuff (or at least what they remember what it was like). I am a fan of the Beatles, and perhaps I'm not very objective when I talk about Them, but believe me, this is a MUST for people who love music and want to read more about the group that changed the history of modern music. It's simply, the story of The Beatles by The Beatles themselves.
0767802470|5.0|I'm an avid Scuba diver and the summer I dove the wreck of the U853 off of Block Island, Rhode Island (the last German Uboat sunk in American waters), the film DAS BOOT was running in my head as I touched the outer hull of the U853, now in frigid and deep Atlantic waters.<br />I had seen DAS BOOT many years ago on the recommendation of my brother.  We saw its first release (at &quot;the movies&quot;) which was in German with subtitles.  Even so many years ago, it stuck in my head right awawy... it was my first movie with subtitles, but I never remembered even reading them.... I was so caught up in the gripping drama and action of the film.  What a tremendously powerful statement on war this movie makes.  It was profound for me, even as a teen ager.  Many years later, having studied the German language now for over a decade (I wanted to know what those Germans were *really* saying in that film!).  I just LOVE the DVD edition because I can watch it in English OR German, with or without subtitles.  It's fabulous to have fun watching a movie AND improve your German language skills at the same time. At least FIVE of the original German actors were called back to do the English dubbing (the five lead actors)when the film was re-released in English... so their voices are very authentic indeed.  I love submarines and this is the BEST SUBMARINE MOVIE EVER MADE and one of the most profound statements ever made about war in general.  An unforgettable film.
B00003CXE7|5.0|When i first was going to see this movie I thought it would be kind of corny. But when I saw it, it was the best action movie I've ever seen. It's got all the action of Brave Heart and a great plot. Plus some great special Effects
B00004XONN|1.0|UNDER-achieving is back in vogue with this PRETENTIOUS - HYPED mess of an album! It is nothing close to the Bends or OK Computer - The songs (dare I call them that) have no structure. I have seen people say thats the beauty of it - Hogwash! If that were the case then nobody would even know about them, If it wasnt for albums like the Bends and Ok, then they wouldnt be in this self-absorbing position, because no-one would care. The song Optomistic is grand though too bad about the rest.
6304342160|4.0|If you've seen and liked The Matrix, you may want to check out this movie.  It's directed by the Wachowski brothers but it's not sci-fi/action like The Matrix.  This is a pretty average action flick with a major twist - the main characters are lesbians.  The 2 characters, Violet and Corky meet in their apartment's elevator and form an ambiguous lesbian relationship.  As they get to know each other better (wink wink), Violet reveals that she is living with an important Mob member, Caesar Marsoni (sp?).  Violet has had enough of the Mob's wrongdoings and wants to get out but is more or less trapped.  Violet and Corky decide to not only get her away from them but also steal a ton of their money.  Their plan doesn't execute exactly as they planned and...well, the rest you'll have to see.  The only thing I don't like about this movie is Jennifer Tilly.. I think her acting skills are poor and the lines she has given sound like something right out of a cheap harlequin romance novel, not helping her character at all.  It's a good movie overall and I recommend it to action or lesbian fans ;).
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day has been my favorite band since they came out. They are the greatest band ever and this CD proves it WARNING: is a graet comeback and now once again it has people talking(not like i wasn't talking about them b4). Every single person should buy this album and all of their others for that matter because GREEN DAY is the BEST and they are here to stay!!!!!!!

0792841344|4.0|The legend of Phantasm seems to have taken a life of its own.  This first in a series of four movies just never seemed to be the beginning of a such a legend.  Instead, it's one complete story by itself.<br />The story begins with a murder and subsequent funeral.  Mike Pearson, 13, is not invited since several members of his family have recently died, including his mother and father.  Mike,  in response to the deaths in his family, has grown attached to his one remaining brother, Jody.  Mike, against his brother's wishes, attends the funeral and watches from the bushes.  When everyone leaves, he sees the very tall undertaker grab the 500 lb casket and without any help, puts in back into the car.<br />The subsequent events, some which appear illogical, involve Mike breaking into the funeral home (at night!) to investigate what's going on.  Other than doing this, Mike seems to spend his time following his brother.  This becomes increasingly unusual since his brother is moving around in his car.  You begin to wonder, how did Mike catch up to him?<br />At the funeral home, Mike confronts dwarfs, a killer sphere, and the Tall Man.  He manages to escape, with one of the fingers of the Tall Man.  With this very lively finger, he convinces his brother that something is wrong at the funeral home.  His brother enlists the help of ice-cream man, Reggie, to fight the forces of evil.  At the center of  this evil is the Tall Man's plan of stealing dead bodies, shrinking them to dwarfs, and sending them through a dimensional door to serve as slaves in another world.<br />Now for the truth.  Jody, Mike's brother, died in a car accident before the movie even began.  The entire movie, until the end, is a nightmare Mike is having.  This explains some of the illogical occurrences in the movie.  The nightmare is obviously the result of Mike coping with the recent deaths of his family members, the questions of where do we go when we die, and the despair of being alone.  When he wakes upfrom the nightmare, Reggie is there to console him and promises that he will take care of him.<br />Unlike The Sixth Sense, where everyone applauded the surprise ending, most will feel the Phantasm ending is a let down. It just seems like such a wasted effort for the director/writer to have created such a story and have it end up as a dream. Still,  it really is a great story about a young teenager coping with the death of his family.<br />Of course, not wanting it to go to waste, the myth of the Tall Man story was subsequently changed to allow 3 sequels to this movie.  One interesting note, this DVD comes with an audio commentary which includes the director.  At the end, the director makes a reference to &quot;this laserdisc commentary&quot;.
B00004XONN|1.0|Severely disappointed...how can you follow up two great CD's like &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; with this?  I only refer to the new CD as &quot;this&quot; because I don't know what else to call &quot;it&quot;.  Call me old fashioned, but I am still one of those people who like to hear &quot;melody&quot; in a song.  This entire CD is void of it.  The first three songs are so bad, I could only get through the first minute of each of them without skiping ahead to the next &quot;song&quot;. This eventually led me to &quot;Treefingers&quot; which is elevator music at its worst.  Believe me, I waited anxiously for this release, and, like a good fan, bought it the day it came out.  Thom, Johnny, and Co., please don't let your egos get in the way of writing the great songs I know you are capable of.  This really is a waste of our time and yours.  Rumor has it that you are already writing a new album that is due sometime early next year. Perhaps you saw the writing on the wall and knew how your fans would react when they heard this drivel.  I read on your website that you were perplexed as to how you would translate this album into a &quot;live&quot; show...I too am now perplexed!  Will you just have the fans file in (if they even come to see you after hearing this stuff) and plug directly into whatever computer you guys used to create this music-less album?
B000021XS0|5.0|This is by far the best Dream Theater CD ever.  This is the album that first got me listening to progressive rock; and even after buying the rest of DT's albums, along with several other progressive albums, I listen to this more than any of the others combined.  There is just something about this Album that makes you want to listen to it over and over.  It has nearly infinite replayability.  Every time I listen to it, I discover something else in the music that I didn't notice before, and this is what the whole idea behind progressive rock is about.  This album ranks up there with Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall,&quot; and The Who's &quot;Tommy,&quot; and it shows that rock music still has something to look forward to.
B00002MZ12|5.0|Caught this show on tv and have been a fan ever since.  Truly!  Alanis was beautiful, the stage was beautiful and her voice was flawless - not to mention her multi-talented musical abilities. Even when she spoke we were captivated by her genuine warmth.  I don't know who Jaan Uhelszki [above] is; but &quot;shrill thin delivery??&quot; Give me a break!  He must be a Barry White fan.  The only song we could ditch here is King of Pain which I didn't like the first time around by Sting anyway.  All the rest are keepers.  Highlights: Joining You, No Pressure Over Cappuchino, That I Would be Good [did you SEE this performance? The flute, her eyes - what a story there] and, of course,  You Oughta Know still delivers the same chill.  You Oughta Love this CD.
B00004XONN|5.0|After months of anxiously waiting for the new Radiohead album, a few days before its release I began to fear what it might be.  Reports were being posted that this new album was a huge departure from OK Computer and the Bends.  That guitars were largely abandoned and they had gone mostly electronic.  And perhaps the most disheartening was the best statement I could find on its content was it was &quot;challenging&quot;.  I love OK Computer, it's one of my favorite albums period.  And in truth I wasn't willing at first to take the risk that something different could be as good. Kid A didn't take two listens to grow on me.  I loved it immediately.  It is different, but it's definitely Radiohead.  After listening through it multiple times today I've become more and more thrilled that Thom and crew took the route they did on this album.  And maybe by the next release I'll learn to keep my doubt in check when it comes to their music.  If you love Radiohead, snatch this one up now.  It's more than well worth it.
B00003CWL6|5.0|There's a reason why this movie won the Oscar for &quot;Best Picture&quot;.  The broad range of emotions in American Beauty is very seldom seen in the visual medium.
B00004W55E|5.0|I just purchased this CD on two days ago, and I have played it over at least 15 times.  I really enjoy all of the tracks, especially Reflections. Rachelle Ferrell has always been one of my favorite artists, but she really comes into her own on this CD.  Other memorable tracks are &quot;I forgive You&quot; and the title track. There is something on here for everyone.  Rachelle keep up the good work, I will continue to listen.
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A is great.  It's not clear at first - even a real Radiohead fan has to give it a few doubtful listens (the first few songs in particular are a bit to get used to), but we had all been warned that it was experimental, and it is.  And it's good.  Techno-based more so than any other Radiohead cd, with a lot less emphasis on guitars, but after OK Computer, could we have expected anything else?  This is the type of cd that you have to sit in a dark room and concentrate on, (although I admit I haven't done that yet) and you still can't take it all in.  I get the feeling that after a few more listens, I'd give this cd 5 stars instead of 4.
B00004XONN|5.0|the first time i listened to this cd was through my computer and the speakers buzzed when the bass was too high usually when turned up too loud and it made me roll around on my floor. i heard it like that a few times then put it in my discman through headphones and fell asleep. at this point i already knew the album was massive. every time, with every listen, getting more and more pieces, fragments, of this creation that soon became an obsession. when i listen to this album i get visions of ice and people watching other people and realising it was themselves and panic and the ocean and its all very soothing. textural music.
0553208845|5.0|This book is amazing there is nothing that will ever compare to it
B00004XONN|5.0|I really really like this album. Be careful though, cause OK Computer is quite a different beast. If you liked that, you may not like this; it lacks the easiness of that album. OK Computer helped you relax, Kid A builds up a certain amount of unrest in you. The rhythms seem a lot more synthesized, what with that unreal organ music and the bells. It almost sounds like video game music to me, but its good! With Thom Yorke being sort of spooky here and there. Its a little hard to understand him though .... Take a look at the dreamscape pictures in the booklet inside the front cover and they'll give you a good idea of what the music is about. Take a look at the hidden booklet (which if I had come across when I was younger, would've probably given me psychological scars) and it'll give you a good idea of what was going through Thom's head when he came up with this stuff. Or at least as good an idea as you can get when it comes to his detached level of intangible thoughts ... that seem to make enough sense after a litle while.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is the first album of the new millennium.  And no, it's not easy to listen to.  But if you are willing to open up your mind and lose your preconceived notions of what a \\"song\\" is supposed to sound like, you are in for a real treat.  Load it into your player and press play, sit back and enjoy the journey.  It's beautiful and ugly.  Glorious.  Insane and genius.  And there is nothing else like it.    <br />This album isn't a direct successor to OK Computer.  To fill in the three year gap between the two, you should listen to the \\"Airbag/How Am I Driving?\\" EP and see the Grant Gee film \\"Meeting People Is Easy.\\" <br />For more insight into the album, look for David Fricke's brilliant review in Rolling Stone #851.
0140185232|5.0|The razor's edge tells the story of several compelling characters at the begining of the 20th century.  The focus of the book is the development of the mind of a young man, Larry Darrel.  Through, war, heartbreak, hard work, and exotic travel, Larry discovers who he is and what he wants.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for meaning in their life.
B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead is beginning to reek of the sweet smell of art-rock pretension. What kind of band would follow up a smash hit poprock album like ok computer with an album that is essentially 48 minutes of anti-songs? Radiohead, the band with the biggest [guts] in the world.  Im amazed Thom Yorke can even stand with the weight of those massive [guts] holding him down.  So how do you review an cd that really sounds like nothing else out there? First it must be said that this is an album in the fullest sense of the word. All the songs are good, but don't really hold up on their own. Every song needs every other song. So do yourself a favor and listen to the whole thing. Do not just listen to optimistic, say &quot;that was pretty. i like radiohead. cake is good.&quot; and leave the rest of the album alone. Be complicated. Be Arty and pretensious. please like this album. It deserves it so much. If not for the quality of the music, at least buy it so Thom and company can buy carts for their huge [guts].
B00004XONN|5.0|Anyone who dismisses this album is missing the point. This band is continuing to redefine rock music as we know it. If OK Computer was Radiohead's answer to the pre-millenial angst we all felt, then Kid A is it's offspring, asking which direction we are supposed to go in now. This resonates throughout the album. It is dense and dark, but completely accessible if you give it the chance. I hope Radiohead take their no-videos, no-singles approach to this record and sell the hell out of it. They are the best band around, and with this album have let traditional structure and melody take a backseat to the otherwordly soundscapes that are all over this album. <br />Kid A is a brilliant calling from a far-away planet that other bands wish they could visit just once.<br />Radiohead lives there.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day has been my favorite band for a very long time. I've followed them every step of the from the Kerplunk days. This new album has been there most highly anticipated and it is amazing, from that catchy song &quot;Minority&quot; to the different &quot;Misery&quot; this cd is Green Day at they're best. They've matured so much with this one cd, they even produced it by themselves, showing their raw talent. They did nothing wrong on this cd, and it can only be described as amazing!
B00002ZMNV|4.0|This particular DVD seems carefully engineered and edited.  The picture and sound quality are quite good and the included documentary is interesting.  An added bonus includes the multi-audio as well as the performance of No Leaf Clover and Human. S&amp;M is a good addition to any music DVD collection - even if one is not a Metallica fan.  The synergism between symphony and rock is both noteworthy and enjoyable.
0811826848|5.0|This carefully-edited review of electro-mechanical responses in the Yellow Sallow Wren of Manchester is amazingly detailed, and accompanied by beautiful watercolour illustrations by Sir George Smythe of Springfield, Vermont.
B000002IMG|5.0|Despite its disappointingly short length, this is an excellent piece of thrash metal.  It's got fast, heavy riffs, plentiful melody, and solos that are out of this world.  Alex Skolnick is one of the greatest guitarists I've ever heard (anybody know what he's doing these days?  E-mail me if you do).  It's hard to pick a favorite, but I think mine would have to be the title track.  It's a wild roller coaster ride of fast and slow riffs, and unpredictable rhythm changes.  The Aerosmith cover (&quot;Nobody's Fault&quot;) is good, too, but I've never heard the original (I didn't even know it was a cover until I looked in the jacket).  &quot;Musical Death (A Dirge)&quot; is an awesome instrumental, and a great way to end the album.  If you love old Metallica and bands of the sort, you should definitely check this out.  It's a shame Testament never got the recognition that Metallica, Megadeth, or even Slayer did, they undoubtedly deserve it.  They are the unsung heroes of metal.
0380730405|4.0|I read this for the first time in 7th grade, and recently re-read it...I loved it even more this time. Dumaurier is a genius at creating atmosphere and tension with the smallest details-- a dinner menu, a broken figurine, a dress. The characters are multi-layered and believable, and the story builds at a steady pace so that you truly cannot put the book down. The gothic spookiness of Manderly and its inhabitants is only surpassed by the power and uneasiness we feel about a dead woman we never meet. Truly, DuMaurier has woven a masterful tale of suspense.
6302968143|5.0|This movie is packed with fun when 300 year old witches come back from the dead to teach the small town of Salem (Oregon) a lesson. Throughout the whole movie, these witches learn to deal with modern life, from thinking a road was a black river, to asking a young man for his driver permit. Anyone, of any age will love this movie!
0446310786|5.0|This beautifully written story of a southern family is a masterpiece of American literature.  I can only assume that the negative comments written below are the result of deliberate sabotage or ignorance.  It is a heart-wrenching and heartwarming tale that superbly reflects the times, including the very real presence of race and gender discrimination.  An astonishing read that helps us appreciate just how far we've come and how far we've got to go.
B000002KGT|5.0|Arguably the best rock album ever made.  Fleetwood Mac had it all when other, even very great, bands fell slightly short.  Impeccable songwriting; three intense, passionate voices with smooth harmonies; and one of the tightest musical ensembles around.  I say Fleetwood Mac was the greatest rock band ever, and this is their capstone.  A piece of history for your CD player...
B00004XONN|5.0|This is not OK Computer or the Bends.  This is a masterpiece of sound, akin to Brian Eno's works of the 1970s.  Perhaps it is a grand joke, or merely an assertion of artistic freedom.  Or a revolution.  Put on your head phones, turn down the lights, and disappear.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I have been anxously awaiting Warning for some time now. Every album they've done, 39/smooth through Nimrod, has never failed to amaze me, and Warning is no step down. It has fewer songs than Nimrod, but each song has increased about a minute longer than their average time. For those of you who loved songs like &quot;Hitchin'A Ride&quot;, &quot;Walking Alone&quot;, &quot;King For A Day&quot;, and &quot;Good Ridance&quot;, you'll love every minute of Warning. Don't expect any hard rock, but a lighter side of Green Day, not implying that they've become happy and chipper, but there is a lot more acoustic guitar, and some other interesting instruments like the mandalin, accordian, harmonica(which they've used before), and an organ. If you are an open minded, true fan of Green Day(and even if you are new to Green Day), this is definately the album for you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00004XONN|5.0|I listened to it right when i got it and have only listened to it once completely. I stepped away from it confused and excited. And as i was walking the dog I realized something. I'm not supposed to &quot;like&quot; it in the same way i like ok computer and the bends. because it's not really an album, but a portrait. My other realization was that radiohead are, in this release, trying to separate the wheat from the chaff. if you come away from the album thinking, &quot;where are the guitars?&quot;, that's exactly what you're supposed to think. When I listened to ok computer for the first time, it automatically aged the bends. Now that i've listened to KID A, it really aged ok computer. They're another band and are going to lose a lot of fans with this release, it's confusing, frustrating, and disturbing. But it's not flawed, as most people are going to see it as. Radiohead knew exactly what they were doing. It goes without saying that this album is their greatest so far, and if they keep on the right track, and don't snap, they will take us to uncharted territories. if you like it, you're lucky, you get it.
B00004XONN|4.0|As with all of my favorite bands, nothing stays the same.  The guitar tapestry most prevalent on The Bends and partially present on O.K. Computer is painfully missing from this album.  One of the attributes I most admire about their music is the way they inverweave(wove?) so many instrument lines together, each telling their own story with haunting hooks that somehow managed to avoid cliche'.  This sounds more like a one-man project to me.  It makes me lonely.  But alas, that feeling is still there which only comes from Radiohead.  This is an album that will take time to seed in my subconcious, but I do have faith it inevitably will.
B00004XONN|3.0|Radiohead seem to have &quot;overdone&quot; it here.  Although the album is quite creative, it pushes too far in its dreamy, uncharacteristically &quot;weird&quot; state.  Don't buy this if you are expecting an album that rocks.  This CD is completely lacking the guitar and every song takes strange twists making it nearly intolerable in places.  Only &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell&quot; show promise.  Sadly, this is Radiohead's first &quot;miss&quot; in their 10 year career.
B00004U8H4|5.0|A simply outstanding film, but by far, a much better read.  One thing that I would certainly like to get across to people out there who are under the impression that AMERICAN PSYCHO is just a movie about a nutjob: that is totally false and has nothing to truly do with the central plot of the movie or book.  This is a story not about a serial killer but about the materialistic and selfish eighties.  It is about how nobody really cared about each other, they just cared about money and impressing others and having the best things in life.  Once again, a truly outstanding film.  I have to say that in a way I am sort of glad that they didn't do EVERYTHING that the book did as far as the killings go.  While the film may seem incredibly disturbing to you when you first see it, I assure you that you would experience that feeling tenfold upon reading the novel.  For all of those AMERRICAN PSYCHO fans out there who have read the book:  Would anybody like some brie? ;-)
B00004XQP4|4.0|This stuff is great, but a warning to all you hard-core punkrockers, this cd is a little more poppy.  But still, great, a must have for any green day fan.
B00004XONN|5.0|In an age of music ruled by the likes of performers like Third Eye Blind, Creed, Eminem, etc., what a relief it is to have an alternative to the 'fridge buzz' heard these days.  <br />Truly artists, Radiohead continue to progess into different soundscapes as seen on Kid A.  This recording can be eerily disturbing (title track, 'Kid A'), ethereal ('In Limbo' and 'Treefingers') and agressively chaotic ('Idioteque' and 'The National Anthem').  <br />Put it in your shopping cart and buy it.
B00003ZA0T|5.0|how dare anyone compare Slipknot to lame bizkids.... Kittie and these guys should have kidz together so that they can go out and kick your f3kk1n a## if you think that Slipknot could suck that bad....  Slipknot,, you rule.. stay honest.
B00004XONN|5.0|Beautiful, just beautiful.  This is the most gorgeous album I've ever heard.  From the quiet beginning on Everything In Its Right Place, to the harps at the end of Motion Picture Soundtrack, this is the most captivating listen ever.  I loved How to Disappear Completely, the strings really move me.  Radiohead have really out done themselves.  All summer, there's been buzz on the net about the &quot;experimental nature&quot; of the album, and how it's going to freak people out once they hear it.  But I think that's really overcomplicating things, just listen to the album, and see what happens.  And if you have any brains at all, you'll realize that this is a truly brilliant piece of music. It's Radiohead's best, and the best to come out of any band in a long time.<br />P.S.  In case no one's noticed, I'm pretty sure the lyrics to Kid A (the song, not the whole album) are printed in the book behind the jewelcase.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A by Radiohead is one of the most breathe taking albums i have ever listened to!  At first listen KID A might sound strange or might make you think, Is this Radiohead?  But after each listen the album comes alive and takes you into a different world.  It is an album that because of it's 45 minute length makes you want more.  Kid A is definately the best album I have heard probably in the last two years.  I would recommend it to anyone who is not a close minded pop-music lover.

B00004XONN|5.0|I can't thank Radiohead enough for taking a chance and making a cd that doesn't sound like every single other cd that's available. This cd is different and it's magnificent. The first listen may be a little awkward if you're not a dedicated RH fan or if you only like their older work but this cd really gets better with each listen.<br />Even the case is cool. The part that holds the cd isn't dull black, it's reflective :)  I don't want to ruin the fun but the case even has a little surprise in it which is well worth the effort of extracting it.
B00004XONN|5.0|the track listing is for 10 songs.  but there are not 10 tracks on this recording.  the tracks are to be listened to from go to gone in toto.  but this is not an album.  no, Kid A, u can pick it up in ur hands, but u can't hold it.  u can play it on ur stereo, but u cannot listen to it.  because Kid A is not music on a disc.  Kid A is that first letting go into the new millenium that comes after u have climbed the peak of 2000 and had that nervous laugh of relief that u really did make it without the cataclysm u KNEW wasn't coming anyway, and everything really was the same as it was 1999, except u're coming down now, cause radiohead has started the descent and u're coming with them, and u feel it in the pit of your stomach.  Kid A is, in wounded melancholy, trepidatious steps, the first polite interrupting cough of a new millenia world conversation.<br />Kid A is a sonic invitation to an uncertain future, the music filled with strong juxtapositions of sounds, rhythms and moods that attempt to escape the limitations of their creators histories. in so doing radiohead invite u to attempt the essentially impossible too--to attempt to escape the limitations of ur own history and find a little foothold of furture.  but u don't have to do it alone; do it with radiohead; do it with all the listeners of Kid A, who are speaking their inspiration here and everywhere; do it with me.

B00004XQP4|5.0|In a nutshell, with &quot;Warning&quot; Green Day proves that the Beatles invented pop punk...
B00003CX8J|5.0|X-Men is a fine movie directed by a fine directory. I was very surprised at the depth of this movie, it translated the comic so well, and keep faith with the great background it created. Wolverine is the best character, and was kept in the mainstream of the plot,including a small look at the Weapon X story (a wolverine story in the comics, about his orgins). The action wasn't as much in the plot as one might think, but the story was spot on. This is the best comic - film ever, so bring on number 2.
B000001EAQ|3.0|I'll go out on a limb - POP actually contains U2's best music since 'All I Want is You' - namely found in the two songs 'Do You Feel Loved' and 'Gone'. But 'Discotheque' is too much like &quot;let's do Fly all over again so we can make a cool video&quot;. 'Staring at the Sun' is too much like Achtung Baby, (which is too full of uninspired 'sing-along' melodies for my taste). 'Mofo' reminds me of 'Wire' in its all out intensity, but the comparison ends there. 'If God Will Send His Angels' is a lot like the feel of some of the stuff on Passengers and is a pretty decent song musically. The rest of the songs are listenable but not terribly noteworthy. However, my biggest complaint is with the lyrics on this album. It seems Bono can't stop saying 'Jesus' and 'God' and usually the references to the cornerstones of Christianity are less than positive. I used to admire Bono's stand for Christianity and open declaration of scripture and its truths. (Most noteably on the War album). Some of the lyrics on POP can make a lot of Christians flinch, as they are dangerously close to sacrilege. A person who has a 'grudge' toward God might actually feel comfortable with some of the lyrics. That's why I cannot consider POP a 'good' album. POP is not a fun album. In many ways, it is U2's darkest album. It has very few positive vibes. And very little truth. If you're looking for The Answer: listen to War - not POP.
B00004U8H4|4.0|I'll start off by saying that this was a film that no-one should have even attempted.  Having said that, I'll salute Mary Harron for taking on the most impossible print-to-big screen translation in movie history...and for the most part, she got it right.  But here, we never really are absorbed into the character of Patrick Bateman and his cold, empty, sociopathology as we were in the diary-like novel.  This is no fault of Christian Bale, who plays the Wall Street raider by day, bloodlusting serial killer by night to the OTT hilt (the idea of Leonardo DiCaprio filling this role makes me cringe).  But whether you want to accept it or not, the graphic (and admittedly often misogynistic) violence of the novel was an important part of painting the picture of Bateman's loathsome and empty soul.  This necessary element was for the most part omitted here (out of fear on the part of the scriptwriters, I suspect) and as a result, the film provokes far less gut-reaction.  Harron should have pulled out the stops, stuck closer to the detail of the novel (if you felt the tediousness and repetition of Bateman's atrocities as the chapters faded one into another, well, think about that for a moment...), and let the NC-17 rating fall where it may; it wouldn't have discouraged this film's target audience.
B00004XONN|5.0|Finally, after a decade of pop-rock in the commercialized, over-produced, &quot;artist&quot; exploited world of the record industry some one speaks up and plays by thier own rules. &quot;Kid A&quot; puts Radiohead so far out in front of any rock band or popular artist. Kid A is not all that easy to listen to. Guitars are few, and Thom Yorke's lyrics are not in the forefront as they are in past albums. Radiohead have created an album of music in an untraditional sense. Sounds and tones, combined to create the music on this album are not in the usual stylings of rock and roll. Voices looped, combines with weird electronic sounds, but not placed to techno beats. At a time when music is about &quot;the single&quot; and &quot;the look&quot; Radiohead bring an enema to the industry. We can hope this new form of expression and musical and artistic understanding sets a new standard for future music. Radiohead are the most important band since Jane's Addiction, and if they continue at the pace they are going will soon pass Jane's and catch Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and The Beatles.

B000001E7T|5.0|When i heard this album for the first time i was a bit intiminated by it  - especially by the first couple of songs which sound a bit &quot;heavy metally&quot; at first. But after hearing the album secondly i started to see really how good it is - with its simple yet intresting base and beats , and with its raw power and emotion which just flows out of pj's voice. this led me to the conculusion that this album is definately a MUST.
0679879269|5.0|Of the books in the `His Dark Materials' trilogy; the sighs of relief, and gasps of wonder and dismay in the Golden Compass; the cliffhanging apprehension, and the extreme suspense in Subtle Knife... and of the sheer brilliance, and intense power, of The Amber Spyglass, this one tops each of them. This extraordinary once-in-a-lifetime literary work of art is most likely the most magnificent and stunningly vivid of the entire trilogy. From the first page, to the last, Phillip Pullman grips your imagination and your entire being throughout the entire book, never misses a beat, and never lets go... The characters seem more tangible and real then you have ever seen them before, so you laugh when they laugh, cry when they cry, and gasp in unison. Every plot, sub-plot, and every fundamental cliffhanger is resolved in an uncannily skilled way. But this trilogy is not just a story for children... in fact; it's much deeper then what lies in the surface. And even if you see just what's on the surface it's still a great ride, but then you begin to wonder, and that takes you deeper, and deeper until you have a secure understanding on what's really being said in these books. Impressive, awe-inspiring, wondrous, and at many times the most heart-wrenching book I've ever experienced, none of there words can fully characterize, specify, or describe The Amber Spyglass in its purest, and most moving form. Phillip Pullman has created something more entertaining, engaging, fulfilling, and absorbing then anything like it to date... but come to think of it, there is nothing quite like it, and there never will be anything quite like it. These three books are literally one of a kind, and nothing will be quite the same in one's eyes once they have been experienced.

B000002KHY|4.0|his CD is a great collection of some classic songs from a great songwriter. So why did I give this CD only 4 stars? Essentially when  it comes down to it, I just get bored by JT's style at times. He has a very slow and steady 70's type feel, that I just find very boring  at times. However, the vast majority of the time, this is the kind of music that makes me want to sing along to it. I remember riding in  the car with my Mom on the way to the daycare and back home every day and she always had it on the oldies radio station that  would play this type of music. So a lot of this music brings back great memories for me of singing along with my Mom. This CD by the  way is one of the most popular ever released by Warner Brothers, having sold 11 million copies already and more every day.<br />  So what do I think of the tracks on this collection. My favorite song is probably the classic &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot; which Carole King  does a great job with. This is the song you've heard a million times, but I still like it the lyrics are simple and yet so very hopeful. Of  course &quot;Carolina In My Mind&quot; is another great song about a man who wants to be somewhere else badly. I've had this feeling many a  time, and this song seems to relay that feeling better than any other song I can think of. &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; is an elegant lullaby,  originally written to JT's nephew, with some absolutely beautiful lyrics. &quot;Mexico&quot; is a great song that has also been sung by Jimmy  Buffet and JT's version isn't much different, maybe a little slower than the way Buffet sings it.<br />  If you like JT you might want to check out Appalachian Journey. A classical project by Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer, and Mark  O'Connor which combines Appalachian folk music with classical continental stylings. JT sings the classic &quot;Hard Times Come Again  No More&quot; which is very reminiscent of some of the songs on this CD. And of course if you like the great songwriting ability of JT I'd  also recommend anything by Simon and Garfunkel, I'd probably start with their Greatest Hits album as well, I think in many ways  they are more complex and more interesting than James' work.<br />  Overall this is a delightful CD that is sure to bring back memories for anyone who is over the age of 20. I highly recommend that you  check it out.And of course if you like the great songwriting ability of JT I'd      also recommend anything by Simon and Garfunkel, I'd probably start with their Greatest Hits album as well, I think in many ways      they are more complex and more interesting than James' work.<br />     Overall this is a delightful CD that is sure to bring back memories for anyone who is over the age of 20.

B00004X01U|1.0|This one's a loser. It won't satisfy her old fans and is a major disappointment to fans (like me) of her &quot;Ray of Light&quot; effort. The songs with her new French producer are over-processed, uninvolving and passionless (how many of those are real words?).
B00004XONN|5.0|i dare you to like this album.  please do.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This movie just whipes its nose on the pages of history, it was not americans who captured the secret germnan code machine, it was the British,that little point aside the movie had some redeeming qualities but how many times can you set and watch the crew fearfully wait out depth charge barrages,not to mention they leave the germans witha absolutely no human qualities making them into monsters instead of men. You want to see a good submarine movie see the classic. You know the one,and if not I can see why you rented this.
B00004XONN|5.0|Alrighty folks, here's the deal...after listening to it and talking about it with my friends, i came to the following conclusion:  If you are expecting &quot;OK Computer Part II&quot; and really don't have an open mind when it comes to music, you'll probably hate this album.  If you are expecting something a little more mellow and experimental than OK Comp, then you'll probably love this album.  Kid A (the album) has a very eerie and ghost-like feel to it.  Among the things the band experiments with is voice distortion, looping, and a somewhat techno style.  One bit of advice for those who buy this album:  Don't pass judgement on it after your first listen.  I made that mistake with OK Computer and stowed that album away for a few years and only rediscovered it within the last year or so.  Since then I've been hungry for anything Radiohead and Kid A certainly helps feed the hunger.  Kid A will grow on you.  My favorite song off the album at the moment is &quot;How Disappear Completely&quot;
0811826848|5.0|I know that the Beatles' story has been told, and retold, by others endlessly, but it was nice to actually read what was going on in their minds as they experienced the madness. From the opening chapters, where they each explain their families and upbringings, through adolescence, Hamburg, London, the U.S.A, Elvis, drugs, groupies and the end, it's all here in their own words. John's quotes are notated with the year they were actually given. The photos throughout the book are amazing; at least half have never been published before. I have read at least 50 books on the Beatles' history in the last 25 years, and there were revelations from the opening pages of this book. The only thing that would have made it complete is John's quotes having the perspective of the past 20 years like Paul, George and Ringo. This is THE definitive story of a musical phenomenon.
B00004XQP4|4.0|This is a good CD. It is not as good as Green Day's older stuff, such as Kerplunk, 39 Smooth, and Dookie. It is still a great CD. Misery is different from the other stuff, but is probably my favorite song. I would reccomend everyone to buy this CD, mainly because it's Green Day and they Rock!!!
0312243022|4.0|I couldn't put it down, but when it was done, I didn't feel satisfied, like I'd been accelerated toward an unfulfilling (but very unexpected, interesting) finish...
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is musical darwinism at its best. Thom York has been clearly influenced by Brian Eno's ambient and atmospherical tunes as well as by Richard D. Jame's (Aphex Twin) and Fonkstorung's experimental and abstarct sounds. The complete album is a collage of re-samples, synth lines, effects and of course Radio Head's own guitar and bass guruism. <br />Musical evolution is constantly developing through this band's mind. If you want to know what music is all about, make this cd part of your personal collection. Kid A will make you smile, Kid A will give you goose bumps, Kid A will make you release seratonin, Kid A will amaze you, Kid A will reshape you and then and only then you will see what Radio Head is all about.<br />If you enjoyed this review contact me, please!!! icq#2627799 ultrahitek@yahoo.com
B00004XONN|4.0|I'm biased; OK Computer is my flawless, timeless favorite album. The Bends is the close second. I just love Thom Yorke's fresh, inventive lyrics and sounds. It's refreshing in the world of rock dreck today.<br />Anyway, the new album: (I can't believe there's over 300 reviews after only two days of its release) even though I love Radiohead, I must say this album probably won't measure up to their past ones. Because it's even more far out and cryptic. Hopefully it'll grow on me.<br />There is one song I have to give my praise to: &quot;How to disappear completely&quot;. OKAy, this song in one word is: HAUNTING. I cannot get Thom Yorke's yowling voice out of my head. It is such a mysterious, deep, profound song. I think it's the standout track; I'm sure others will disagree. I heard that this song, as well as the album, is about the concept that a KLONE is not a HUMAN, but a product. The first line to this song exemplifies it: 'That there . . . that's not me'.<br />Thom Yorke, I think, may be to cryptic for today's flash-over-substance society. But for fans of art-rock and experimental music, or anyone with just an open mind, Radiohead is the ultimate.
B00004XQP4|5.0|great cd, i liked every track. kind of like nimrod, don't like all of the tracks initially but like them more as you listen to them. once again, great cd.
B00004TRD8|5.0|I read through the reviews here and came across with one that explained on how to key in a code to see the extended special edition, which is 2 minutes and 43 seconds longer. It has an additional scene of T1000 searching around John Conner's room and an alternative ending where you can see old Sarah Connor. Anyway, that particular review stated that to unlock the extended version, you need to key in 82297 at the special edition menu. I was not the same code as mine. Mine is 82997. So, I figure that those of you who got the DVD could also have different codes. Anyway, it's quite easy to figure it out. When you select the special edition, you will see another submenu. On the right side of the sub-menu, you can see some kind of a VCR button symbols. They are actually roman numeric codes. A square and a rectangle is actually a &quot;I&quot;, a triangle pointing down is actually a &quot;V&quot; and 2 small triangle pointing up and down and towards each other is actually an &quot;X&quot;, So, mine was &quot;VIII II IX IX VII&quot;. If you key in correctly, the codes will change to &quot;The Future Is Not Set&quot;. You will then see the the T-800's both eyes glow and the extended special edition movie would start immediately.
B00000DR5W|5.0|A recent Benetton ad shows individuals of mixed racial origin and is captioned &quot;why should any group hold the copyright to beauty?&quot; This is the essence of Sakamoto's work.<br />Drawing from Okinawan influences a la Champloose Kina, Youssor N'Dour from Senegal, fretless bassist Pino Palladino (then with a portfolio of work ranging from Tears for Fears to Paul Young), Sly Dunbar and Arto Lindsay, Sakamoto eclectic blend of world music is a surprisingly cohesive whole. <br />From the brooding &quot;Rose&quot; and &quot;Diabaram&quot;, to a remake of &quot;We Love you&quot; and the odd Okinawan folk song (Asadoya Yunta), this collection will pretty much attempt anything. This is much in contrast to the minimalist &quot;1996&quot; album (which might have resulted as a response to the excesses of this album). It is as though Sakamoto attempts to showcase his eclecticism.<br />The first two tracks (&quot;Tokyo Calling&quot; and &quot;You Do Me&quot;), are reminiscent of his earlier album, &quot;Neo Geo&quot;. The background cast of Okinawan singers (now with the group Nenes), and the seemingly random bluesy vocal inflections from N'Dour is classic Sakamoto in composition: musical pop art. The atmospheric &quot;Rose&quot; is perhaps the best track on the album with Palladino's legato fretless lines holding the piece together, despite Sakamoto's average vocal attempts. &quot;Diabaram&quot; is N'Dour at his emotionally charged best.<br />My only gripe... there is something to be said of someone who titles his album &quot;Beauty&quot; and has an arty picture of himself on the front cover.
B00004XONN|5.0|With all the pablum being spoon fed to the CD-buying public, it's amazing that Radiohead could take such a bold step, and release a new work that truly can be called art. Remember when rock and roll was seriously viewed as artisitc expression. Not boy-band tripe, not misogynistic rap, but music to make you think, feel, respond? Radiohead has succeeded admirably with this release, which bears no resemblence whatsoever to their classic OK Computer, other than the ethereal voice of Thom Yorke. This is clearly a leading candidate for CD of the year...buy it now if you believe that music should pull us out of our everyday existence.
B00004STPT|5.0|I usually don't collect soundtrack, but boy! this is a good one. Simply mesmerizing, touching, and the track 3 'Battle' is good when you need CONFIDENCE! Listen to it and you will know what I mean!
B00004XONN|5.0|The first listen is liable to be disinteresting to anyone but the most devoted.  Subsequent hearings reveal deeper motifs across the songs which in the end make this one long song of an album instead of individual songs.  This is certainly not easy listening.  My first thought was...Sonic Youth mixed with Dead Can Dance.  But this creation is completely new and original and could only have been done now by Radiohead.  This band will be remembered for this album in the years to come.
B000002U9L|5.0|I highly recommend this soundtrack to any Jim Henson lover, to all Labyrinth lovers, and to anyone who has ever tried to wish away their younger brother (or sister).  The music accurately tells the story and reflects movie's fantasy feeling.  It is a CD that belongs in every one's collection. A+
0679441018|5.0|Another brilliant addition to the Vampire Chronicles.  In Memnoch the Devil, Lestat seems to show signs of a conscience and recognition of his own faults and possible vulnerabilities, which helps the reader to care for him. <br />The story is far reaching and challenges readers to open their minds.  Ms. Rice's imagination is awe-inspiring.  Memnoch's feelings about God's relationship to humanity, being indifferent, struck a chord with me as I'm sure it will many other readers.<br />The book was a surprise in that an author would take on this subject matter.  Ms. Rice does so with her usual creative flair and writes a book that will long stay on my bookshelf.  If you are a fan of Ms. Rice's work or have read the other vampire chronicles, you will enjoy this book.
6305358613|5.0|As someone who studied Tudor history at college, this may not be the most historically accurate film ever made but the ones that always are accurate are usually pretty boring and really belong on the History channel. This is basically a thriller set against the backdrop of one of the most dramatic periods in European History. <br />One reviewer mentioned that Stephen Gardiner, the Lord Chancellor and Bishop who rebelled against Elizabeth died 12 years before she came to the throne. Well actually he died 3 years before she came to the throne, but who cares? This was an enjoyable, entertaining film with some superb performances especially from Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush as her close adviser, torturer and Assassin Sir Francis Walsingham.  The film makes some assumptions about her relationship with the Earl of Leicester played by Fiennes but why not? <br />Braveheart is one of the least historically accurate films about British history ever made but it didn't stop it from being enjoyable and exciting. As a historian I think that if any film makes you want to go to your history books after you've seen it then it has definitely been worthwhile.<br />Just one correction from what an earlier reviewer mentioned. The Mary's featured in this film were Queen Mary of England, who went mad killing protestants and died making Elizabeth Queen. The other Mary was Mary of Guise who was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary, Queen of Scots herself was not actually portrayed in this film at all. Too many Mary's!
0393314804|5.0|After seeing the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot; I decided it was time to read the novel that got it all started.  After all, the lead actors in the film even claimed they feel in love with it after thier first reading!  Trainspotting had to be the first Real adult book I read.  Now being 15, at the time I was 14, it was a bit of a chllange.  The hard scottish accents were tough to get around, but once you got through the first two chapters it was fine.  Welsh does however, start his chapter of strangely in the sense that you are never quite sure who is talk until you reach at least the second page.  Over all.  It turned out to be the best book I ever read!  IThe characters caught my attention and they gained my sympathies (even when, at times, they didn't desrve it).  Renton is an amazing voice in the book and it is no wonder that Ewan McGregor turned him into a cult hero in Britain.  This book should definitely be on the top of everyones reading list.  As it is, I have read it three times, not to mention lent it out so often, that I find I will have to buy myself a second copy.  And it's definitely worth it.  Trainspotting is Irvine Welsh's greatest accomplishment!  READ IT!
0811826848|5.0|Do not be deterred by the high price of this book, it is worth every penny. For everyone one of us who ever wondered exactly why did the beatles break up? how bad was John's drug problem? and who were the beatles before they were the &quot;Beatles&quot;? this book finally has all the answers. The stories in this book catalogue both the personal lives and trials of all the members and also the blossoming of thier music careers (and how thier manager tried to shaft them left and right. And as if the stories were not enough, the book is filled with so many photos that don't be surprised if you have a flash back to that Beatlemania you once knew...
0451450523|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read. And that is saying alot for I read 24/7!!! I kinda knew already what would happen because I've seen the cartoon movie years ago. Since that was great and could still remember it I wanted to see if the book is just as great. <br />This is a story of a quest, the search by the unicorn-immortal, infinitely beautiful-for her lost fellows. Early on, she is joined by Schmendrick the Magician. A kind of upside-down Merlin, Schmendrick is looking for something for himself too, his life perhaps. Molly Grue, the third of the travelers, seems simply to embody every womanly trait. After a richl entertaining variety of adventures the search reaches its climax at the castle of evil King Haggard, where the terrifying Red Bull is encountered and where the handsome Prince Lir plays his predestined role. <br />I like the whole book but the ending. It was sad and tears were falling from my eyes. I won't give the ending away but it should have told us what happened to the characters.
B00003CXE7|5.0|A spectacular, brilliant movie, Gladiator is certainly my favorite of the year.  Surprisingly deep for a supposedly action movie, it can easily be put in the drama section as well as the action one.  Russell Crowe puts in a fine performance as a Roman general out for revenge, and Joaquin Phoenix surprisingly brings a complicated and human side to his villain Commodus.  Crowe may have given his role power and heroism, but Phoenix certainly gave his depth and charisma.  Aside from the two leading actors, however, the movie itself was surprisingly close to history.  Though an improbable story, it was certainly a possible one; and it certainly brings back memories of a by-gone movie era.  The epic picture may not yet be gone from the movie industry.  A job well done by Ridley Scott!
B00004XONN|1.0|in fact its unlistenable to, dont buy it!
0780626966|5.0|Simply, a perfect collection of one of the best horror movie series ever !!! Nothing more, nothing less to be said...Can't wait the Freddy Vs Jason one.
B000002MY3|5.0|At first this album sounds like a pissed off femanist, after a a while you start to see what was put in to it. the anger can be felt and the sadness indured if you just lie back with the music full blast on. thie is one of the greatest albums of all time probebly 2nd, after supposed former infatuation junkie!       listen to this, it is flawless!
B00004Z511|5.0|After stunning the world with one masterpiece after the other, it's a sure bet that &quot;Kid A&quot; had a lot to live up to. It does just that with it's simplicity and ability to evoke thought and emotion. From &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; to &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack,&quot; the listener is left contemplating what, or who just happened. <br />Although much more stripped down than the grammy award winning and critically acclaimed &quot;OK Computer,&quot; &quot;Kid A&quot; offers an entire new side to Radiohead. Singer Thom Yorke's vocal melodies segueway to some of the most provocative radiohead music to date.<br />If &quot;OK Computer&quot; was the signature album for radiohead, &quot;Kid A&quot; promises to be the dots on the I's, and the crosses on the T's.
B00000K31V|5.0|Having been been from a class in analyzing film, I have seen eXistenZ and it gave me one hell of a headache that kept me watching it a dozen times till I agreed on some plot for the movie itself. My analysis on eXistenZ is that it goes beyond the limits of what doesn't or does exist, and what is real and not real to confuse the viewer. It's tremendously cerebral! To the viewer from National City Ca., who thinks he's solved the plot, I ask this: &quot;Why didn't david cronenberg choose the title transendenz and not existenze? Could this mean their still in eXistenZ or the whole damn thing is eXistenZ from beginning to end? The acting, to me, in the ending of the movie was just as it was in the beginning, absolutely weird and no sense of concrete place or characters at all. (Hey, If you think you've analyzed this movie try NAKED LUNCH which was an older david cronenberg flick, let me no when you lose track of plot? I did. See you in interzone.)<br />In conclusion, eXistenZ is very thought provoking movie but I'll have to say the matrix and eXistenZ are the same because they both challenge the existence of the characters in the story using two different plots each with different level of technology rather than special effects. If you like the hard plot of matrix you'll like eXistenZ!
B00004XONN|3.0|Listening to 'Kid A' is a lot like eating a lobster!  You may have to sift through some unpleasantries; it can get rather tedious, but there are some delicious bits.  Several tracks ring true with the kind of creativity and attention to detail we've come to expect from Radiohead ('How to Disappear Completely', 'In Limbo') but the electronic-oriented tracks (i.e. 'Idioteque') are disappointingly derivative.  Sorry, guys--the Warp/Rephlex artists have perfected this sound since the early '90s (and are far better at it!).  On a side note, I seem to remember an Oasis track entirely similar to 'National Anthem' that wasn't exactly lauded.  Radiohead cult-members take note:  listen to the Warp/Rephlex/Skam/etc catalogue and Talk Talk's more esoteric work-- you'll hear _innovation_ back when it occurred.
B00004XONN|4.0|i can't believe no one has reviewed this album yet!  i heard it in its entirety on M2 a week before its release.  it's very much a 'moody' album - much more atmospheric than OK Computer, which IMHO is more of a rock album.  But it's got the brilliance of Radiohead and they can do no wrong.... definitely one of the best albums of the year.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B00004XONN|5.0|With every successive release Radiohead attain new levels of mastery and drift further from the rest of the rock world.  We're the luckier for it.  Few dare to try to break new musical ground and fewer still can even find new musical ground to break.  Radiohead have taken their own form of prog-rock and launched into a new sonic landscapes.  Kid A is a natural progression from OK Computer.  On it they move into the realms of electronic music peopled by the likes old Future Sounds of London or even Eno's Music for Film.  But it is still Radiohead.  Rather than relying entirely on samplers they instead lead us on a vast quest.  The CD is epic  ranking up there with the likes of Sparklehorse's &quot;Good Morning Spider&quot; or Flaming Lips &quot;The Soft Bulletin.&quot;  It's ethereal, haunting, and grand filled with lush keyboards and effects laden vocals.  There's not a bad track on the album but if forced I would say that standout tracks include &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack,&quot; &quot;The National Anthem,&quot; &quot;Optimistic,&quot; &amp; &quot;How to Disappear Completely.&quot;  It's not the most radio friendly CD, there isn't a single verse-chorus-verse song on it.  This shouldn't detract anyone for it is pure brilliance.  This is what prog-rock was meant to be.  This is what music is supposed to be.
078322799X|5.0|\\"The Frighteners\\" is one of those movies that has you exasperated at the finish, but smiling from ear to ear! This movie has it all:  Great story, incredible action, awesome special effects, and great characters! Jackson crafts a brilliant story with fun character actors in out there roles. I don't want to give away the movie's plot because watching it unfold is so much fun. You'll get plenty of jumps and laughs along with some genuinely touching moments.  I've shown this movie to many people and every one has liked it. The ending sequences are fantastically shot and edited. Filmed in unbelievable fashion, they leave every moviegoer asking how Jackson and his team pulled the sequences off--once again, can't tell you why; it would ruin the end. What balances the bombast are the performances of Michael J. Fox and Trini Alvarado along with the many richly-drawn supporting characters--tooo many to name here. Each character adds their own magic to the ensemble.<br /><br />For those inquiring about the quality of the disc, let your fears subside. The picture is very clear and natural looking.  The Dolby Digital soundtrack is thunderous and very impressive! Every sound is rendered cleanly with monsterous LFE channel support. It is truly an impressive reproduction of this movie. The disc does contain a few cast/crew bios and some production notes, but they are not the grade of some of New Line's extras. Still, the disc stands out for it's impressive presentation of its feature.<br /><br />I hope everyone discovers this little gem. It makes for great movie fun and will be great addition to any DVD library! Get a hold of this DVD! You will be entertained!
B00004XONN|4.0|Upon the first few listens, &quot;Kid A&quot; is an indecipherable cosmic trip through the minds of Radiohead. But like all great albums, after 6 listens or so, the album begins to separate itself and each song starts to stand alone. I don't know if this album is better than &quot;Ok Computer,&quot; but it's certainly more daring (if you can believe that...).<br />Highlights from &quot;Kid A&quot; are &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; (arguably their best song ever) - &quot;The National Anthem,&quot; and &quot;Optimistic.&quot; I haven't even dissected this album completely, and I know there are some other highlights, but really - this album is overwhelming and hard to decipher without tons of listens.<br />Bottom line: if you didn't like &quot;Ok Computer&quot; there is no way in hell you'll like &quot;Kid A.&quot; This album is not for everyone.
B00000JCOV|5.0|What was going on?  I had no idea when i was listening to this album.  As soon as i heard, &quot; the whole thing i think its sick&quot; i was like this is gonna kick so much a** it is not going to be funny.  Then probally one of the heaviest songs ever SIC comes on and you cannot believe that people in masks can move that fast on their instruments.  These guys can play with the big dogs, SLAYER PANTERA, and METALLICA!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead have once again succeeded in steering ever-further from becoming empty-headed hit-minded musicians.  Their latest disc, Kid A is an alarming primal wasteland, evocative of tribal simplicity and baroque austerity. This latest effort, as well as the previous, bring to mind the world-weary tones of T.S. Eliot's post-modern poetry. This disc will surely confound those fans expecting the arena-style rock of their first release Pablo Honey, and the accessibilty of The Bends.  Comparisons have been made to Brian Eno's work, and the same might be said of this cd and Blur's latest, 13.  Thom Yorke is (as Usual) in fine falsetto form, especially on the track entitled &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;.  Tracks 6 and 7 meld seemlesly together to form the backbone of this disc, a resonant groundswell of indescribable power. This disc is an essential addition to your collection and deserves your full attention-light some incense, turn off the lights, lay on the floor and just give in to it!
B00004Z511|5.0|This album is brilliant. If you like the crap that is played on the majority of radio stations here in the US, don't buy this album. You'll hate it. I love this album. I also liked Pablo Honey,The Bends and Ok Computer, all for different reasons. This is a band that is  evolving. That's what you're supposed to do. Other bands might want to try it. It's nice to listen to.
B00004XQP4|5.0|wow. whats there to say, green day is amazing. This cd is so different yet it seems they've changed none. Confuesed? heh yea me too. well all i can say is that they ROCK. and you should deffinatly check out this cd. totally worth it.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I've been waiting for this CD for such a long time! It's so pleasing to finally be out! This CD is awesome. My fave songs on it are Church On Sunday, and Minority. This CD is just as good as Dookie! Maybe better!
076790382X|2.0|I guess because it is a collection of observations and not as focussed as his other books I lost interest in this one. Without a central theme other than &quot;How strange America is now&quot; Bryson's generally on target wit and observations tend to meander from point to point. Viewing America from the perspective of an American who had been away for years is definitely aimed at a British audience who I hope enjoyed it more than I did.
B00004XONN|4.0|Obviously a popular album, judging by its high rating (#1 on amazons sales ranking as of October 4/2000), this cd contains a mix of emotional melodies that are best observed through a relaxing, casual listen on the sofa.  I won't waste words here - this cd is an exciting exploration of sounds that transcend (and in some ways overshadows) any lyrical presence.  This is the cd's character, and this is why you should buy it.  Don't buy it for purely catchy melodies or singles - buy it because it is an excellant cd from start to finish that provides the listner with both creative, music insight and unparelled dedication (from a popular band) to musical evolution.<br />Naming songs would clearly take away from the emphasis on the whole of this album...<br />A note on the four star rating for this cd:<br />I'm very particulate on what I ultimately recommend.  This is a very exciting cd, so don't assume it is any worse than any of the random 5 star ratings you will get from 'fans' throughout this website.  I would only give five stars to a cd above and beyond mere musical brilliance...<br />I'm not sure I've found that cd yet...
B00003CXCS|5.0|OK I admit it, I love this film period!  1965 baby and went to see it with the extended family - wonderful child memories.  BUT what ever &quot;artistic person&quot; decided to distribut this film in anything other than widescreen sould be forced to watch &quot;The nightmare before christmas - 25 times&quot;  Closely followed by watching PYE (cannot remember how to make the symbol) 5 times.
6305949980|4.0|... Tim Burton is now a favorite of mine. There is also a great making of and the deleted footages are so fun. Many more extra's also such as an art gallery with over 400 stills, and of course the commentary which I never bother to listen to on any DVD. Now the movie itself is brillaint. The animation is superb and the plot is just amazing. My only complaint being that at many points the film is lacking and just moves so slow, hence the missing star. Dont get me wrong, it is an enjoyable film and definitely one I watch over and over, but many scenes have some drab and boring music, that Im not sure of kids will enjoy. But the film is amazing and that is just one flaw. Its a must. This DVD is a MUST...

0375804013|5.0|I teach 3 year olds at a Day Care Center and read this book a few times a week. It is a sure way to get them all to sit still. No matter how many times they hear it and by now know the conclusion they sit enthralled. They even know the words and say them with me. I always ask... &quot;Should I turn the page&quot; and they all yell &quot;YES&quot;. They laugh and giggle and act scared... It's pure joy reading it to them and watching them react!  They have special books that we read over and over and over and this certainly is one of them. My book is getting rather thread bare and I'm buying a new one.
0679777547|5.0|While I enjoy a good mystery, the problem with most of them is that the plot has been done to death.  Man murders wife.  Woman steals diamond.  Cute old lady solves crime.  The characters may be new, but the plots are so . . . familiar.<br />On that basis alone, THE CLUB DUMAS is worthy of high praise.  The plot is unpredictable, for the reason that you've never read a story like it.  It's a breath of fresh air, while still adhering to the basic tenets of the mystery genre.  It has a well-worn hero, a mysterious woman, an evil henchman, and murders upon murders.  It also has (let me get my other list) terrific dialogue about the nature of literature, motives that I've never even considered, and the love of a good conversation.<br />THE CLUB DUMAS begins simply enough, with a detective tracking down a source.  But right from the start, something is just slightly tweaked.  Lucas Corso is a book detective, trying to authenticate a handwritten transcript of THE THREE MUSKETEERS.  It may sound boring, but quite soon, Corso is being stalked, in a tangled web that includes a murderous widow, twin book forgers, devil worship, regret over lost love, and insanity.<br />It reminded me, slightly, of FALLING ANGEL, by William Hjortsberg.  It, too, followed a world-weary detective on a quest into the heart of evil.  But ANGEL, as good as it is, doesn't have CLUB's flair for the unobvious.  Author Arturo Perez-Reverte knows how to construct a plot, but he also has a keen insight into a rarely-viewed segment of our population;  the book collector, in all his or her's eccentricities.<br />THE CLUB DUMAS is a mystery that will keep you guessing, but it's more than that.  It is an essay on the quality of imagination.  It is a mystery for book-lovers, not just mystery-lovers.  It is a remarkably smart book.<br />P.S. - If you've happened to see the movie adaptation of THE CLUB DUMAS, entitled THE NINTH GATE, don't be dissuaded from reading the novel.  THE NINTH GATE drops entire plot lines, and does not detract from the enjoyment of the novel in the slightest.  It also isn't very good.

158234082X|4.0|If you have any thoughts about getting into the restaurant business, read this book.  It will enlighten the reader on the many positives and negatives (mostly negatives) on what this business is really all about.  I have some friends in the restaurant business and much of the book replicates their business and personal lives.  Many messages here, one of which is being willing to totally commit your life to the business or don't even bother to try, because YOU WILL FAIL!  I love to cook<br />and I'm now convinced to do ALL my cooking at home. <br />I wish the book had provided the address of Brassiere Les Halles, because I would like to dine there some day.  I have searched all over the internet and cannot find a street address or e-mail address.  Can anyone help me on this?
B00000DLV1|4.0|First off, for a live album, the recording is outstanding.  It's clear, balanced, and the acoustics are excellent.  Obviously it's not on par with the ultra-produced &quot;Dummy&quot;, but you have no right to expect better from a live performance.<br />Beth Gibbons's voice is much more fragile here.  At the right emotional moments this can aid a song, but at other times you're trying to will her to hold a note she's straining for, such as in &quot;Humming.&quot;  There are, however, songs where she seems to be in her comfort zone, like &quot;All Mine.&quot;  But on the whole, the standard set in the studio albums just isn't reachable.  <br />I was hoping the orchestra would be more prominently featured.  The songs that make use of it definitely benefit, and you'll enjoy the horns in &quot;All Mine&quot; and the strings in &quot;Only You.&quot;  &quot;Strangers&quot; is the track where it really hits you, and I so dearly wish they had cut the electronic sounds from it entirely so I could fully enjoy it.  The more popular songs don't fare as well.  &quot;Sour Times&quot; should be skipped.  It was an experiment, and I understand why they wanted to try it, but they never should have recorded it.  It's barely recognizable in the bad sort of way.<br />The audience... I will never forgive them.  They mostly stay out of it, but what they did to &quot;Roads&quot; was just criminal.  The band had a beautiful set prepared for &quot;Roads,&quot; and these escaped mental patients turned it into a clap-along.  Yes, &quot;Roads,&quot; one of the loneliest songs you can imagine, a clap-along.  To this day my enjoyment of the studio recording is lessened due to the experience.  Those people should have been sterilized immediately.  If the preservation of beauty matters to you, skip that track, always.<br />I am not a fan of live albums, but I would say that Roseland is among the more worthwhile of them.  Some of these songs are really enlarged in this context, and the rest are atleast different enough to make the experience new.  But definitely get the studio albums first.

Many messages here, one of which is being willing to totally commit your life to the business or don't even bother to try, because YOU WILL FAIL!  I love to cook<br />and I'm now convinced to do ALL my cooking at home. <br />I wish the book had provided the address of Brassiere Les Halles, because I would like to dine there some day.  I have searched all over the internet and cannot find a street address or e-mail address.  Can anyone help me on this?
B000001EAQ|4.0|This album is a deep thought on many things: love, sex, death, life, the great beyond, Miami, and especially a song for Bono's own deceased mother (Mofo). I enjoy it very much, I believe it is a great testimony to a band being able to have pop beats, techno, and depth all in one. (Saying this in lieu of - - and this is personal opinion - - Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Britney Spears, etc.) I would listen to U2 and any style they put out any day, as long as they always have the depth they have always had. I'm greatly looking forward to the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, and the return of rock 'n' roll U2.
B00000IAU3|4.0|This is the kind of cd you really have to appreciate. I totally agree with the positive reviews of the DIDO &quot;NO ANGEL&quot;. I too discovered her music early on, and was pleased to see it featured in the talanted but underated show Roswell. Her enchanted tempos, and earthy voice have been compared to the greats of Sinead and Sara M. This is one treasure where you find yourself wanting to tell all your friends, but decide to indulge for yourself.
0811826848|5.0|With the wealth of info already out there on The Beatles, one may ask &quot;Do we need more?&quot;  In some cases, the answer would be... &quot;No.&quot;  In this case, I say &quot;Welcome.&quot;  <br />This book is huge for one thing.  There are a lot of pictures you've seen before, but a lot of personal pics seen for the first time.  Like the video Anthology, we get to see a more personal side to The Beatles in this book.  One drawback is that you'll notice some of the same images from the video as you do in here.  Also, in terms of content you'll often just see written quotes from the video.  Regardless, there is plenty of new material here to make this a &quot;5 star&quot; effort.  Having read almost every Beatle book out there, I would have to say this is a definite buy.  <br />Final Note:  Once again, only drawback is some overlap with the video Anthology which is expected.
B00004XONN|5.0|This band keeps getting better and better. I know when you first listen to this CD, you think hey this is wierd. But intrumentally this album is brillant, it isn't as full of great lyrics as OK Computer and The Bends, but instrumentally this is great follow up, you gotta love 'Idioteque'<br />if you don't own it, get it now.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album exceeds all expectations!  It took a couple of listens to get used to, but it is now one of my favorites.  Radiohead is not afraid of taking chances and have a wonderful and original sound.  This isn't your pre-packaged Backstreet Boy, Britney Spears bull crap.  This is the real thing.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00003CXDG|1.0|Worst acting in years,  worst attempt at a story, can't even compare to the worst Bond movie.  I'll bet this is the first &quot;action movie&quot; that many people dozed off in.
068484267X|5.0|Aside from the dull color of the cover, Angela's Ashes is filled with a gripping color that makes it hard to tear away from the book, that is without feeling a little ashamed of the complaints I harbored as a child.  Frank's childhood shows not only the anguish he faced as a child, but presents a logic that the reader must adapt before finishing the book.  The simple yet imaginative mind of young Francis kept me reading hours on end, and when I finished I had no choice but to find it's successor, 'Tis, in order to continue on his personal journey to find something worth living for.
0767805712|4.0|What a contrast! LIS is a plotless, joyless demo reel of how far we have come with digital special effects. Gattaca is so strong a movie that I cringe when I see it on the sci-fi shelf at the video store. Like &quot;The talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, the movie deals with assuming the identity of another. Odd that in both films those characters are played by Jude Law. Gattaca is sparse with special effects, but where they are needed, they are used effectively. The plot is as compelling as any I've seen in years. Great casting and the director sets the perfect mood. I saw not a single misstep with this rare, fine &quot;sci-fi&quot; film. I will be waiting to buy the DVD special edition when it comes out.
B00004XONN|2.0|First of all, let me start off by saying that O.K. Computer is one of the greatest recordings on the 90's.  Since I fell in love with that cd, my expectations were very high for this album.  I was very let down!  This is supposed to be a rock band.  For a rock band they do not like to use too many &quot;live&quot; instruments.  These songs seem to lack focus, and only two seem to even resemble songs at all!  I am not saying that this album is not inventive, it is boring!  One of the only things I find unhypnotic about this cd is the cover art.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is quite simply the most ambitious musical record. Kid A cements radiohead as the greatest, most imaginative, creative, musical act ever.
B00004XONN|5.0|Haunting keybords come, uninteligible robot-like hummings make you hallucinate and a journey through the odd world that Radiohead created begins. The most creative rock band of our time has made a miracle: a stunningly beautiful PIECE OF MUSIC (not a bunch of songs... some of them can't be even considered songs) with very little melody. But instead of melody, the sound landscapes inmerses the listener into these feelings of fear, breakdown and madness the album irradiates. Thom Yorke's voice is best than ever (not forced, but extremely subtle and most of the times digitally enhanced) and it can be heard in the amazing &quot;How to Dissapear Completely&quot;. This song is a central part of the record, with a line that says all about the feeling the album transmits: &quot;I'm not here, this isn't happening&quot;.  The sounds range from beautifully arranged strings (sometimes dissonant, perfectly dissonant) to maddened horns (the chaos comes at &quot;The National Anthem&quot; the most surprisingly raging moment), great dreamy and echoey sampled voices (at the end of Morning Bell) and even an almost-dance song (the moving and interesting Idioteque). Everything finishes in slow motion, with a track that can be either seen as a masterpiece or as an emotionless and ironic ending: Motion Picture Soundtrack. The fact is that it is a heartbreaking finale, and the &quot;I will see you in the next life&quot; leaves you wanting more Radiohead. <br />More of the best. Because this is their best.
0316777722|5.0|I had requested this book as a birthday gift and received it.  I had heard David on National Public Radio and thought he was fun and funny.  I read the book and this collection of short stories just gave me hours of entertainment.  After I finished reading it I kept telling people about it and the stories.  Just goes to prove everyone has a strange family if you give it some thought.  I found this a great pick-me-up book and would recommend it to anyone who just wants some light and fun reading.
B00004XONN|1.0|I've been reading through these reviews and am struck by the probability that all those 5-star, glowing reviews are from the already converted, while the 1- and 2-star reviews are from new listeners to Radiohead.  Or, like me, old listeners who really aren't in the mood to put up with another onanistic, self-indulgent album from superstars (see REM) who can spend as much time as they want in the studio and don't have anything to lose by putting out this kind of nonsense.  If what you like about Radiohead is the beauty, brilliant lyrics, and wonderful, symphonic song structure of OK Computer (deservedly rated one of the 5 best albums of all time), then do yourself a favor and skip this CD--I hear they have a real album coming out in the next few months.  However, if all you want for your 13 bucks is some mindless noodling, a lot of synthesizer, and distorted vocals buried WAY down in the mix (when there are vocals at all), then be my guest and buy this experiment gone horribly awry.
B00004XONN|5.0|I almost feel embarassed to say that I wasn't taken away with the first listen.  After going through the entire record several times, I realize that Radiohead is one of the few comercially successful bands that actually mean anything.  Music that's new, music that's creative, music that makes you want to make music, music that makes you feel good to be alive.<br />I could go on with some pretentious talk about electronic beats and eerie vocals, but the MS-Word thesaurus isn't working. :)<br />I thought OK Computer couldn't be bested, but it has been...by the farthest stretches imaginable.  Lots of praise...yeah.  Blatant band worship?  Not a bit.  Get it and give it time.
B00004XONN|5.0|As a 16 year old rock fan it depresses me sometimes to realize that I have missed the golden age of rock.  But an album like this restores my fading faith in music.  It is intimate/distant piece of art that I hope many radiohead fans will like, sure it's different from their other work, but isn't that why we like them = they evolve, much like The Deftones who have cited radiohead as influences.  all The tracks are great and it's best heard as a whole, with all of your brain soaking it up.
B000002U8U|5.0|Bob Seger's albums are the definition of &quot;Rock N Roll&quot; and that is that. He has a voice that is open and honest,not a lot of incoherent screaming and jibberish. You can understand where he is coming from and going.If you've had good times and bad,indeed if you've lived life at all, you will identify with most of his songs. And this is another great album in his long line of them. If you don't have it,get it. You'll be amazed.

0312952813|5.0|Since I only recently started reading the Michael Connelly series featuring Harry Bosch, I made sure to start reading them in order.  This 2nd book is just as great as the first book(Black Echo)and the story delves a bit more into Harry's character-something that you will likely find in all of Connelly's books featuring Harry Bosch.  This time around Harry gets involved(without the approval of police brass-surprise)in the murder of fellow detective Calexico Moore, found dead in a rundown hotel room.  As expected, there's more than one plot that intertwines as the story develops.  Harry takes over the cases of a detective he works with in the RHD, a man with a drinking problem who suddenly calls in saying he's taking early retirement.  The first case Harry looks into involves a dead laborer found just outside of a diner frequented by cops.  It so happens that particular case was worked on by none other than the late Det. Cal Moore and bingo! Harry, with a little extra research starts to put two and two together and you're well on your way to a fast moving, mesmerizing story with a really surprise ending.  Very highly recommended, especially for those that enjoy good mystery/suspense stories with unlike detective heroes.
B000009QPG|4.0|Yep, that's the most powerful line on the CD. I love War Ensemble. But that's just the beginning. Slayer has once again made a half thrash/half slow album but enjoyable few songs I like. The fast ones are the ones I listen to because that's Slayer. I'm not really into this so-called &quot;well-rounded,mature business&quot; because that simply means they've changed when I'm happy with their known style;thrash metal. but I'll say this much, the five good songs on there have deadly,powerful lyrics and are enjoyable. WAR SUPPORT, SPORT THE WAR!
B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day's back, and I must admit they're more stuck in my head than they've ever been.<br />&quot;Warning,&quot; the band's sixth album, is trenscedant of all of their previous albums, even &quot;Nimrod.&quot; Gone are the punk tracks with guitars so loud you can barely hear the already only-slightly-audbile Billie Joe Armstrong.  In their place, we get songs rampant with harmonica and vocal harmonies.<br />The lyrics are as good as they've ever been, but it seems as though Billie Joe didn't quite know what to say sometimes, though it's clear he WANTED to. <br />The bad: The songs are EXTREMELY short, the lyrics are at times cryptic, and the steady three-chorus/three-cord format is well in place.<br />The band is good, and so is the album. Die hard fans will be pleased, but it may not sit well with most.

B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A is what music should be: creative, innovative, and just emotionally draining. amazing.  Radiohead has impressed me yet again with this new record, and I eagerly await the following next month.  It's outstanding, my favorites being How to Disappear Completely (and never be found), Everything in it's Right Place, Idioteque, and Motion Picture Soundtrack. The only reason it didn't score a 5 star is because Thom York, being one of the most amzing vocalists (like Ed Kowalczyk of Live) needed to sing more. Highly recommended for the patient people out there. Not for the simple minded.
B00004X01U|3.0|After Madonna revitalized her music career and importance in pop culture with &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, I can't deny I was expecting another brilliant album as its predecessor.  Although &quot;Music&quot; does have its moments of magic, overall, the album falls short.  The title-track is a good opening for the album, but one can sense that nowhere on this record is the exuberance or joy Madonna sang so proudly about on the title track for &quot;Ray of Light.&quot; Most of the tracks on the album remind me a bit of the tracks from 1992's &quot;Erotica&quot; album where we find the potential for powerful songs, but because of the producer's wishes (and as we have learned from interviews, the artist's wishes as well) to keep the tracks at a minimalist level, they never live up to the level great Madonna songs can have.  This can be especially found in such tracks as &quot;I Deserve It&quot; and &quot;Gone.&quot; Luckily, though, &quot;Gone&quot; saves itself with somewhat introspective lyrics and a calmess only a 42 year old Madonna can sing with, but &quot;I Deserve It&quot; fails overall, although the good intentions behind it are evident.  Tracks such as &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; are at times simply ridiculous as Madonna seems a bit out of date singing about such material as being boy-crazy and jealous.  Maybe Christina and Britney can sing about such material, but certainly not Madonna, or can she?  Some tracks do stand-out and one can see where Madonna went right in choosing Mirwais as the main producer of the album. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; with its intensity and urgency does put the listener on a journey which loses us in the moment for a strong three minutes, before bringing us back to Earth. &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; is absolutely beautiful at times with Madonna's voice seeming as if it is about to break down into sobs, despite the computerization of it.  The album ends with a solid progression of strong tracks. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; (an extremely well-produced track about romanticism and Madonna's refusal to let it die), &quot;What It Feels Like for A Girl&quot; (an overrated track, but a good one nonetheless of subtle, female power), and &quot; Paradise (Not for Me)&quot; (picture a woman's internal feelings while being in love, and you'll understand the song).  The sad part, though, is that the entire album doesn't end on such a solid note once you step back and ask yourself what you think of the album.  Less production, more Madonna?  Better production, better Madonna?  &quot;Ray of Light&quot; part 2 maybe?  Well, maybe not the latter...but the album does make you yearn a bit for Madonna/Yoga Diva to appear again.  Ultimately, you have to remember that the entire reason Madonna continues to remain an important force in popular culture is because she changes with the times and refuses to stay in one place.  I guess &quot;Music&quot; is the current place to be at...oh well.
0060168366|4.0|I think that is a better name.  Mr. Johnson has a delightful and sometimes acerbic style that he uses to write history how he sees it.  I have read his \\"Modern Times\\" and \\"A History of Christianity\\" also, and I think all are high quality, well-researched, historically accurate accounts of what happened.  I disagreed with many of his conclusions about the `why' and `how' of an event, but I commend him on his arguments and wealth of knowledge.  He shows keen insight on many points of American history, and if I were Catholic, I think I would have liked him even more. I tried to keep in mind his conservative Christian leanings and not be too critical when he strayed off the objective path he usually started on.   I am somewhat disturbed that such a good historian can be seemingly objective in one area, but yet completely biased in another.  This may be why I am intrigued by him.  Definitely a good read.  <br />If you know of other high quality works that are worth reading, email me, and I will consider putting them on my list to read if I haven't yet read it.  Thanks.
B00004XONN|5.0|When Prince released Around the World in a Day after Purple Rain, everybody thought he was crazy, funny little songs, yes, but strange and in no way the bigger=better thing everybody expected. Radiohead did just the same thing, OK Computer was a strange and fascinating record that by some strange accident became quit popular. But this is no arena band, these are musicians who dare to take the risk to dissapoint those little girls that can't wait to throw teddybears at them.  Thing is: they don't want no bleeping teddybears. This is a great record, it will not be very popular but it will be loved for a long time. If Britney Spears is your thing, don't even try to listen, you only hurt yourself.
B00004R99J|5.0|Ok, so I'm not a big fan of kid's typical cartoon (er, excuse, me, &quot;animated&quot;) movies (er, make that &quot;films&quot;).  I sat through most of this thing, ok, some of it.  Not bad.   But the kids (girls, ages 4 and 9) love the damn thing.   The DVD quality was lacking compared to the other ones they make me watch, but they don't care.   I think they're watching it again right now....man, wish I had boys so we could OD on football....
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A is what music should be: creative, innovative, and just emotionally draining. amazing.

B00004XONN|4.0|With great anticipation of  the new Radiohead Album &quot;Kid A&quot; I felt an unpleasant disappointment coming on.  But I was surprised.  Although this album has very few guitars in it, it's pure Radiohead.  Here is a song by song review<br />01. Everything In It's Right Place<br />Features samples of Thom singing backwards and forwards. Surprisingly enough, the live version comes frighteningly close to the recorded one. <br />02. Kid A<br />Another brand new song which may have been originally built by a computer program. The title of the song, &quot;Kid A&quot;, may have something to do with a project of Carl Steadman's about the work of Jacques Lacan entitled &quot;Kid A in Alphabet Land.&quot; <br />03. The National Anthem<br />&quot;The National Anthem,&quot; is the album's &quot;Exit Music.&quot; Colin's bass line is wildly hypnotic and the pure and utter body of this song forcing attention onto itself and away from Thom's vocals, which are prominently less featured on this album compared to the others. This is not to say that his vocals aren't stunning, but the fact that Yorke's vocals were ProTooled around with (small vocal parts cut and pasted to repeat over and over again), displays the band's interest in concentrating less on the centerpiece of the band and more on the collective entity. The bombarding and escalating brass ensemble on &quot;TNA,&quot; first appear almost cliche in it's perfect disorder -- horns of all kinds coming from everywhere in a very discomforting manner -- the cliche ends once Thom screams and begs out &quot;Turn it off!&quot; with as much conviction as possible. That's when you get the idea. That's when you understand that it's the anti-cliche.<br />04. How to Disappear Completely<br />This epic of a song debuted during the band's North American tour in April 1998. The song was written by Thom in June 1997 while Radiohead were in Toronto, first referring to it as &quot;This is Not Happening&quot;. At this early stage the song isvery lengthy and quite repetitive but is of course up to the expected Radiohead standard.<br />&quot;How to Disappear...&quot; took it's name from a title of a book about how to erase your own identity and assume a new one. Here is the description from the publisher: (thanks to Seth)<br />&quot;How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found is for everyone with a need to not only disappear from their former life, but to start a new one. It tells how to plan a disappearance, document a new identity, find a job, and establish credit, plus coping in the first few days, and more.&quot;<br />The book is now out of print.<br />05. Treefingers<br />&quot;Treefingers&quot; will hands down be one of the biggest surprises on Kid A. It has no real melody and is instrumental. Despite rumors, it is not &quot;Egyptian Song&quot; under a different name.<br />06. Optimistic<br />By far the best song on the album, &quot;Optimistic&quot; is, perfect. This is the song that Radiohead nailed everything right on. From the vocals to the brilliant orchestration which closes the song. This is the song that everyone will love. The studio version is considerably slower than the live one. <br />07. In Limbo<br />The studio version is very close to the live one.<br />08. Idioteque<br />Another song that fans have no clue about, &quot;Idioteque&quot; can be seen in two ways: A blatantly stupid attempt at making a cheesy dance song (hence the name), or genius. What &quot;Idioteque&quot; essentially is, is a dance song, beats, and all. This, of all the songs on the album, is the experimental one that stands out as much as &quot;Electioneering&quot; did on OKC. It will either be your favorite song, or your most hated. However, it can't be ignored.<br />09 Morning Bell <br />This is one of the more catchier songs in the tracklist for Kid A.<br />10. Motion Picture Soundtrack<br />A favorite of Thom's, he expected it to appear on OK Computer, but unfortunately the band decided not to include it. Thesong has been played on a few occasions on the OK Computer tour, often as a powerful encore with just his voice and an acoustic guitar.<br />If the future of funerals has a sound, this is it. In it's organ driven glory, &quot;MPS&quot; is actually one of the more put together songs and optimistic songs on the album (despite the funeral reference). This is actually the song that you hear when you're going up to Heaven and arriving at the Pearly Gates. The cascading harp ending pretty much backs up this theory.
B00004XONN|5.0|I love it , I love it , I love it. I heard this CD a week before it was released, and Radiohead is one my all time favorite bands. This cd is not in the same vein  as previous Radiohead Albums. Also I noticed that after I opened the Cd if you remove the casing of the cd then there is a hidden booklet. (you have to unclip the black part that the cd snaps into.) Beware this CD is different and more experimental So listen to it expecting that. I look forward to  the Spring 2001 tour.
0790749998|3.0|What othe reviews of this movie have failed to mention is it's popularity among people who are not normally martial arts fans. Most of this is due to the plot, there is one.  The othe cause is that acting talents are called upon.  The fact that they are not always delivered is inmaterial.  The movie sets a fairly brisk pace and the fights are well staged and always plot driven. Not since Jackie Chan's First Strike has a martial arts movie been as well received in the US.  I look forward to more of the same from Jet Li.
0800132343|5.0|No doubt the best submarine movie ever made. In fact, the best war movie ever made. In my opinion, this is probably the best movie of any type ever made, surpassing Private Ryan (which I believe is the second best), among many others.  See this one with at least a 35&quot; screen and good stereo.  The depth charge effects through good stereo penetrate your soul. Quad sound allows you to hear sounds from in front and behind you. The actors portray their excitement, stress, fear, and other emotions to the point that you can actually feel how they feel.  I've seen the original, and I've seen it dubbed, and no doubt watching the directors cut with subtitles brings true reality in the German language. For another review of this movie, see the movie section of uboat.net, which explains a little more of the intricate details that went into making this movie....including building a u-boat from original plans.  I typically do not like seeing a movie more than once, and I have seen this 4 times so far, and plan on seeing it at least twice in the next 3 months.  You will be pleased.
B00004XONN|2.0|I was tempted to give this disc more stars just for being different, but then I thought more about it. Its different, but only among bands that are popular. If you want meandering sound-scapes, which make up much of this recore, than there are a dozen lesser known bands that do the job in more interesting, and in the end, more fulfilling ways. With the exception of &quot;How to dissapear completely&quot; (a masterpiece of a song), this disc left me cold. But maybe, in the end, that is the point. If they recorded this to communicate the coldness of this technical world, then, well, great album. But if you want that same message in song form, try &quot;the sophtware slump&quot; from Granddaddy.
B00004W55E|5.0|From the cover to her sweet lyricism, Rachelle has gone through a transformation. Her work has always been captivating, her range astounding. But the title asks, \\"Can I be me\\". Of course you can girl. She looks fabulous with natural hair. She's written or co-written most of the cd-a change from her debut album.  I almost drove off the rode when I heard \\"I Forgive You\\". The song's a testament to purging the complicated, that which you don't understand for a chance at peace and clarity. She dips up and down harmoniously, highly, lowly with \\"It really doesn't matter/what you did anymore/It doesn't really matter/what you did it for/Or who you did it to/I forgive you.\\" If New Mexico can inspire work like this, I'm ready to move.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead have gone and done it.  They've walked up to the front of the cliff of popular music and jumped off.  The band that helped define 90's alt rock with The Bends and OK Computer have gone one step further and completely rewritten the rules.  Bridges and choruses are hard to come by on Kid A.  So are traditional instrumentation and singing.  Songs like &quot;The National Anthem&quot; and &quot;In Limbo&quot; float on propulsive beats and bass lines.  They shimmer with processed guitars and keyboards, and snippets of voice.  What did Thom say?  It doesn't matter.  The record is meant to seep in to your unconscious.  It flows from your speakers to your ears and finds a nice place to curl up and rest.  Instead of resting on their already impressive laurels, Radiohead have created a masterpiece of postmodern music.  Kind of what Samuel Beckett would sound like if his weapon were the guitar and not the pen.  The wait for Godo is over, and he has arrived in the form of Kid A.
B00004XONN|5.0|Fans of Radiohead whose ears are attuned to the oft-unpredictable, structureless sounds of much electronic music are the ones who will most clearly hear and appreciate the talent and effort that went into creating this album, and realize what a logical progession it is. That said, it's a *great* record :) Not sure yet if it beats OK Computer or The Bends, but it certainly holds up on its own. <br />Crucial Thought: Music doesn't need to &quot;rock&quot; to be good.
B00004XONN|5.0|It's in it right place, and will be a classic! you'll see... I love the odd all over the place music Radiohead brings to the table. It left off where ok Computer ended (another classic) in 2 words MUST HAVE!
B00004XONN|5.0|Sigh........ it's so nice to have a new radiohead cd in my player. It just reminds me that there are bands out there that care to make original, interesting, and sonically pleasing music. And who really cares if they don't have a video or single out, I don't. MTV doesn't play videos anymore and radio stations are too scared to play something that's this good. Ok Computer is legendary and Kid A, in my opinion, is as well. It's extremely intoxicating. But I didn't expect anything less.<br /> Bravo!!!  This is what ART is supposed to be.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead has always stood for a certain state of mind that one has difficulty putting into words...so I won't attempt to.  Yet every thing they do, from artwork, to lyrics, to studio effects (ie: the computer voice on OKC), appeals to this state of mind.  The new album does exactly that.  It can be described as...a lot of &quot;Radiohead&quot;.
B00004XONN|5.0|Without a doubt this is the most unique record I have ever listened to.  Radiohead is a musical group who are trying to make music an art again.  Be ready to feel alienated again because this sounds nothing like what we have come to expect.  Hardly any power chords and typical song structure is thrown out the window.  Instead what we get are songs that tap into the walled up feelings in our head and brings them out with sonic guitars and organs and tribal drum beats and Tom Yorke's chanting vocals.  I was actually in fear for what this album was making me feel.  Don't get me wrong this is Radiohead just a different Radiohead.  If you are a fan of Radiohead you will love them for this record.
B00004XONN|5.0|The new Radiohead release &quot;Kid A&quot; comes out today,  October 3rd, at all major music vendors.  This is Radiohead's first major release since their guitar charged and radio friendly &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995) and the beautifully artistic masterpiece &quot;OK Computer&quot;(1997).   Though it has received rave reviews from all music critics,  do not expect the same kind of pop monsters that have thrown Radiohead into the ears of the mainstream population such as Creep,  Karma Police,  High and Dry,  Let Down and You Do It To Yourself.     &quot;Kid A&quot; is richly dark and electronically lush.   A huge departure from such guitar driven gems such as The Bends,  Anyone Can Play Guitar, Electioneering,  My Iron Lung,  Trickster, etc...  another noted departure is the number of album tracks.  on average the usual number of tracks on previous albums was about 13 selections.  &quot;Kid A&quot; only contains 10.  but it is these 10 tracks that will change the way modern rock and roll is viewed and written.  Radiohead is the new musical standard!  If you are a fan of Third Eye Blind,  Blink182,  Alanis Morrissette,  Santana,  311,  Creed,  Days of the New,  Everclear and crap like that,  do not pick up this new release because you do not deserve to listen to it.  It's musical splendor will be wasted on your 3 chord shallow brain!<br /> P.S.   no offense attended,  if you do like the above listed bands.
B00004Z511|5.0|a previous review i read asked if that particular reviewer &quot;was missing something&quot; with respect to this album -- the answer is 'YES'.  radiohead is unwittingly saving rock 'n roll from the superpop depths to which it has recently sunk.  they evolve as other great artists evolve like REM, Paul Simon, Pink Floyd, Morphine, etc.  This album is a departure but only toward what has been occuring in the world of Computer Art music in the last 30 years... the samples of Paul Lansky and Arthur Krieger on 'Idioteque' tell this story...  a beautiful though heady one... this is not a pop album.  i bought it the same day as Stockhausen's Helicopter Quartet...
6304493681|4.0|A fairly interesting story and great animation. The art is supurb, at times you almost forget you are watching an animation. The story in good too and has an interesting ending. It keeps you into whats happening and is never dull, though a bit confusing at times. I would definitly recomend watching this movie!
B000002UDG|4.0|All The Best contains many of Beatle Paul's greatest hits, and is a great album.  However, it is missing many songs worthy of spots (Too Many People, Maybe I'm Amazed, Ballroom Dancing, Big Barn Bed, Venus And Mars/Rock Show, Letting Go, Hi Hi Hi, Helen Wheels, Let Me Roll It).  It is also plagued with many weak songs, that were unfortunately placed on the album (Silly Love Songs, Let 'Em In, Goodnight Tonight, With A Little Luck).  The album contains all of McCartney's obvious classics (Band On The Run, My Love, Live And Let Die, Junior's Farm, Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey, Jet), which is a relief.     In my opinion, the smartest way to compile this collection, would be to make a 2 disc greatest hits set, instead of a 1 disc version.  This way, all of McCartney's fans would be able to enjoy his well-known, and lesser-known classics.     Despite the fact, that many of favorite songs were left off this album, I still recommend to anyone who is a Beatles fan.
B00000AFWZ|4.0|Ok, this is the best collection of one hit wonders of the early garage band and psychedelic era. But where is &quot;Pictures of matchstick men&quot; by Status Quo? &quot;96 tears&quot;? &quot;Western Union&quot;? Also, the fourth cd is made up of mostly terrible stuff that should have been left buried in a grave of obscurity. Still, there is nowhere else to get all of these &quot;almost&quot; hits that are so dear and close to the heart of this listener who was an adolescent in the late sixties. I love this sound - a drum, a bass, a lead guitar, a vocalist, and maybe an organ player. A must for 60's punk rock and psychedelic fans. Is it worth the big price even with the missing elements? Yes!!! Get it and spend several weeks enjoying the 118 songs here that you probably haven't heard in decades!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|At last a &quot;rock&quot; band that dares to do something completely different and succeeds. This should be nothing new for Radiohead fans, though. With songs that put most contemporary music to shame, lyrics that are truly poetic (and can stand on their own), videos that are better than most feature films, a &quot;conceptual&quot; web page, live performances that feel like religious experiences, and their innate ability to move one with sounds and words, they have indeed pushed the boundaries again. Graciously, they did not &quot;dumb it down.&quot; If Mozart makes taking a test easier, then Radiohead makes it easier to understand the world and our situation in it.<br />I expected another OK Computer, and I was upset when I listened to the first few songs. <br />Yet, the songs are as emotionally potent as those on OK Computer. This time, the emotion is different, though. Haunting, echoey vocals and technoesque grooves put forth distress and that feeling you get when you finish a book that you have enjoyed every page of. It is a feeling of loss, but not despair. I can't explain this emotion any better than this, one must listen to feel it.   This album is what the Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Adore&quot; should have been. A mesh of technology and poetry and music.<br />Modrian learned to paint still life portraits before he mastered abstract art. Much like Radiohead mastered normal guitar, bass, drums, and vocals before they made this album. <br />My one complaint: it should have been longer. &quot;Kid B&quot; is in the works perhaps? One can always hope.
0944379095|1.0|I am not a nazi, and Im not a jew,  Im the former of an anti-nazi militia unit. But in order to understand Hitler, you have to read this book, because it will help you understand all the facts of ww2, since the rising of Hitler, to the formation of death and concentration camps and the extermination of more than 6 million jews, by reading this book you will understand that only with the mentality of Hitler, and the discipline of German soldier was it possible to form such things as the Gestapo or the Waffen-SS, only a person with the mentality of Hitler would be able to write all the crimes he would comit in a book, and explain why the Nazi party passed to history as the most dreadful empire.
0811826848|5.0|&quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; doesn't reveal much new history about the band; the Beatles are already perhaps the most exhaustively chronicled and dissected group in history, and there are books that offer day-by-day diaries of the Beatles' lives and their music. (There's even one book, Mark Shipper's &quot;Paperback Writer,&quot; that's a hilarious semi-fictional history, complete with loopy footnotes.) <br />What &quot;Anthology&quot; does do is offer first-person viewpoints from the four men who sat in the eye of the storm called &quot;Beatlemania&quot; and present their often very different memories of the same events. <br />The book's release comes more than 30 years since the group's breakup. During that time, each band member embarked on varyingly successful solo careers, and also endured an unfathomable tragedy -- the 1980 shooting death of Lennon by a deranged fan. Despite the distance that time has provided from their days as the best band on the world, the living members say they will always be Beatles. <br />&quot;It was a one-way love affair,&quot; says Harrison. &quot;People gave us their love and their hysteria, but the Beatles lost their mental health.&quot; <br />Ringo Starr's thoughts are more poignant. It's &quot;impossible to turn the page and say, I'm no longer a Beatle,&quot; he says. &quot;To this day, and for everyone, that's all I am.&quot;
B00004XONN|5.0|This album creates, and is definitely for, a certain mood: a gray mood. It's more instrumental than older Radiohead stuff, but it just creeps into your soul.  Perhaps some people don't like it because it is not as radio-friendly, but the instrumentation, layering, rhythm, and feel is beautfiul, such a mature sound.  <br />The cymbals and horns in &quot;The National Anthem&quot; are intense. Yorke's voice and lyrics on &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; bring tears.  You just have to close your eyes, scrunch your face, rock with the rhythm, and feel the sound.<br />This album is one that if you don't like right away... you'll like it more and more with each play.<br />It will haunt you.
0671034065|4.0|Oh My!  What can I say?  I could NOT put this book down from beginning to end.  Loved Jaime and Sam especially (what's not to love?).  Followed the women from first concept of their kind of man to the end and hated to see it end at all.<br />Could there PLEASE be a sequel to this one with Jaime and Sam?
B00004XQP4|5.0|This cd was really great.  I have listened to it like 3 times in one day.  I love the beat that it gives.  I am already giving away this cd to my friends they all want it.  So you should to.
B00004XONN|1.0|I've been a huge Radiohead fan ever since Pablo Honey and I have loved just about every song they have ever released.....until now. This is honestly one of the worst album I have ever listened to, and what makes it worse is we all know that Radiohead is capable of such greatness. OK Computer was certainly not what any of us expected but it was able to combine experimentation with the rock vibe we except from Radiohead. However, Kid A seems to take experimentation far beyond anything that could be considered rock or alternative or whatever you want to call it. Radiohead has said that commercial success has never been their goal and that is made abundantly clear on this album. They seem to have thrown the guitars out the window and traded them in for keyboards. Even the traditionally outstanding vocals of Thom Yorke are lost in the over experimentation. So unless you are a huge Radiohead fan I suggest that you pass on this one.
068484267X|5.0|hey :)<br />i've just finished reading angela's ashes and all i can say is WOW!! :)  i can't describe how much i enjoyed reading this book, and i can't wait till i read Tis!  i couldn't stop reading this book.  the way he describes his childhood is amazing. it's hard to understand a book like this if you've never had any real struggles in life, but... well, it's just great.  he wrote this book in a way so that mostly anybody could enjoy it and understand it. i mean, it's his life! :)  i didn't know wether to cry or laugh sometimes... this is definately a MUST read book!  i hate writing reviews for books 'cause i'm VERY bad at it, but i just HAD to let everybody know that this is a GREAT book! if you want to know more details about the book you can email me at: rivas_juanita@hotmail.com. later, take care
0811826848|5.0|Tons of photos. The text is all an oral history. If you're a Beatles fan, this is for you.  I am a little disappointed in how many photos we've seen before, and that there are more photos than text. But I still love the book.
B00003CWTI|2.0|Magnolia was the worst movie i had seen in years - maybe the worst of all time. I can see how some people with a propensity to overanalyze this film would pull out something meaningful - but sitting thru 3 hours of stultifying dialogue, poor acting and self indulgent sweeping gestures that PT Andersen is making a habit of .. would bore the pants off anyone else.
B00004XONN|4.0|Although Kid A is not as good as The Bends, in my opinion it surpasses OK Computer. The music on Kid A is alot more accomplished than on OK Computer, with Radiohead exploring new sounds to thrilling effect. One of my qualms, however, is that Thom's voice at times sound altogether too distorted. Nevertheless, that fact doesnt detract too much from the fact that this is a great album. Top songs: Everything In Its Right Place, The National Anthem, How To Disappear Completely, Optimistic and Morning Bell. The only weak track on this album in my opinion is the title track. Musically it is somewhat self-indulgent and Thom's voice is almost unrecognisable. But even that song has its positives. Go forth and purchase your copy!
B00004XONN|5.0|Hurray for Radiohead! Due to the huge success of their last album they will get many people to listen to this album who would not have otherwise. People need to hear music that challenges the ear from time to time -- even if they don't like it. I remember when Talk Talk released their &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; album and most fans were completely puzzled and let down. That album is one of the groundbreaking albums of the 80's and one of my all-time favorites. Like Spirit of Eden, Kid A is a bit of high art, with occasional bursts into more acceptable pop sounds. Many people will not understand or like this album. Good for Radiohead! To paraphrase Igor Stravinsky, it's not what people say about a piece of music that matters, but how much they say about it. By challenging the ears of the unexpecting general public and other bands, this album paves the ground for chartering adventurous new courses in music. The spirit of CAN lives on through Radiohead. Most important, this is a beautiful album.
0780631684|5.0|Final Destination is the best movie of the year.It is an edge of your seat thriller that draws you in from the first of the the movie,until the very end.You feel like you are a part of all the mysterious deaths.This is a great movie for anyone.
B00003CXDG|1.0|for those of you who have not read gene siskels big book of hollywood cliches,read it youll have loads of fun if you watch this movie afterwards, john woo has meticulously gone about taking the most cliched parts of all action movies ever done and assembled it together in mi-2,not satisfied he has done scene to scene reconstruction of the previous mission impossible with slightly diffrent settings like the fall through the shaft and the vehicle chase ending. aircraft interior begining ,insider cheating etc. and the music is there in such a manner that it becomes difficult to concentrate on the screen. and tom cruise hasnt trained half as hard as keanu reeves did  on matrix,so his stunts look concocted and extremely artificial. however the triumph bikes were gorgeous, hence the one star.
B00004Z511|5.0|I've had the MP3's for Kid A fom more than 3 weeks now but I wanted to wait until I had the album to write this review.  I believe this album will provide a little test for every Radiohead fan out there. Those who claim that Radiohead is the best will certainly be tried while listening to this epic.  Not only is Kid A totally different than OK Computer or The Bends, it deviates from music all together.  Never before has a band put out such a brilliant composition (making reference to OK..) and then follow it up with a totally different type of theme.  It was a ballsy and gutsy move on Radiohead's part and it has seemed to pay off. And even if it didn't, Thom Yorke wouldn't care because Kid A means more to him than it does to economics. It's brilliant!
B00004XMVL|5.0|This has to be the best movie that I saw in 1999.  For those who were not satisfied with the movie because of weak characters and plots you must have missed the great special that was on the sci-fi channel.  Also the book goes deeper into the individual characters. (esp. Riddick).  He is not even a &quot;true criminal&quot;, the only people he killed where bad men.  The in the dark special effects had me at the edge of my seat, and I have to say it Riddick was very sexy. Though I wish you could see the creatures better, it was still a great movie. I can't wait till I can get my DVD!
020530902X|5.0|I was surprised when I knew that this book was written 65 years ago, but its fourth revision still ranks as one of Amazon's bestsellers. I think that everyone who wants to improve his own writing should read this book. There are a lot of guidance and tips on how to write better. &quot;Avoid fancy words&quot;, &quot;keep related words together&quot; are just some examples. Some of the tips are simple, but we often forget / not realise them.<br />This book implicitly tells the same writing principle that I got from my writing class: &quot;Reader is the master, reader is always lazy, and writer is the reader's slave. Writer has to work very hard to make the reader EASILY understand what the writer wants to tell&quot;.<br />I am glad to have this book. If this book is useful for native speakers (as indicated from customers' review), this book is also useful for non-native speakers like me.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is not as brilliant as it's predecessor, but it comes close. When you you hear this cd, you understand why 'OK Computer' comparisons go right out the window. This is a far more ambient and moody album. OK Computer was that too, but it wasn't as dark and somber the way this one is. 'The National Anthem' is a rambling cacophony of pounding bass and brass. 'How to Disappear Completely' is morose and minimalistic yet it manages to sweep you away. This song is worth buying this cd for. Honestly, no-one expected another album like OK Computer, but few people want to give this one a chance. Listen to it again.
B00004XONN|4.0|Not entirely certain about this one yet.  It takes a little work, but I give'em high marks for effort and avoiding safe choices and taking new directions etc. Dark and broody - if you're expecting Ok Computer or the Bends or almost anything else yer in for a shock.  I think I like it a lot but I'm not sure it'll stay in my cd player for a year or two like the above mentioned did.  But if yer a 'head head, ya gotta get it.
B00004XONN|4.0|Everything seems like a let down when there is so much anticipation.  With possibly one of the greatest albums ever recorded (OK Computer), the follow up is going to have the world on the line.  Of course when I purchased Kid A yesterday (oct. 3) I expected no less then the glory I heard on Ok Computer. Dissapointed?  At first at least. I kind of expected Kid A to be my dream album.  I love techno (moody techno like Aphex Twin), and Radiohead is my favorite band, so Kid A seemed like the ultimate combination. I listened to it over 3 times yesterday and it wasn't until the 3rd listen that the songs began to have an affect on me. There are songs that I'm already in love with, namely the opening track, &quot;Everything in It's right place&quot;. It flows in coldly, eerily, but hypnotic, like the haunting beauty of a ghost.  Track 8, idioteque is a triumph for radiohead in that they succesfully created a entrancing mesmerizing piece that breaks down the standard rock and pop rules and moves music in general into the future.  At first both How to Disappear Completely and Motion Picture Soundtrack annoyed me because they are both gorgeous rock songs that have been transformed in the studio.  But I always trust what radiohead does, and look for meaning in their presentations.  The slow airy feeling of How to Disappear presents the sense of being lost better than the early live more rock and roll versions I've heard.  I'm still not sure if I like the studio recording of Motion Picture Soundtrack with its extremely loud harp effect drowning out the lyrics, but once again in more and more listens I'm sure I'll find meaning in it, and the song is so gorgeous it could be sung by a rat (how I dunno) and still be stunning.  And that's what is special about this album, I find it growing on me, and I discover something new everytime I listen to it, it's like studying a play or novel.  There are certainly no instantly gratifying tunes on this album. I'm pretty sure in time my four star review will be a more justified 5 star review, but for now, remembering the brilliance of OK computer, I feel a bit dissapointed for a few reasons. One being the album felt anti-climatic. It also didn't really touch me the way ok comp. did with songs like airbag, letdown, etc.  But again, I'm finding the songs more touching as I listen on.  The album feels short, there are only 10 songs.  One song, treefingers, is an ambient piece, which I like alot, but I feel like I'm being gipped because its strictly just mood music and no real melody which is what I look for in radiohead.  Third of all, as of now I hate songs 6 and 7.  So all in all it leaves me with only 7 songs I like, not that much.  On the other hand, even OK COmp. took me a year to truly enjoy and this album is even harder.  There is something special about it, there is something intriguing that makes you want to listen to it again and again and just understand it, maybe because its so different.
B00003CXE7|5.0|If you thought BraveHeart was good, this puts it to shame, Gladiator is an unspoken film, and its been a real long time since I enjoyed myself in the theater. Get it and enjoy the rollercoaster...
B00004Z511|4.0|I'll go ahead and say what everyone else is going to say:  no, this is no OK Computer.  But why should it be?  Radiohead already made that album, people can already listen to it; why should they have to repeat themselves?  What they've done, instead, is veer in an entirely new direction.  Kid A is full of sparse, amorphous songs heavy on keyboards and dislocating effects.  Sometimes, as on the title track, I found myself thinking of Aphex Twin.  (The band cited DJ Shadow as an inspiration for the bass/drum break at the end of &quot;Airbag,&quot; so this is not as big a surprise as it might have been.)  It lacks the sweeping grandeur of OK Computer, sure, but its chilly experimentation is interesting (and, yes, quite moving) in its own right.  As an analogy, I love Bowie's &quot;Changes,&quot; &quot;Life on Mars,&quot; etc., but I also get a big kick out of &quot;Sound and Vision,&quot; and the latter's lack of glam rock stylings or cabaret attitude never really struck me as a defect.  As Bowie himself said, &quot;Sometimes I feel / The need to move on.&quot;  If you want a band to make the same album again and again, you're better off being a ZZ Top fan.  If you're ready for something new and different, check out how dramatically and successfully Radiohead have moved on.

0553579908|5.0|A monster creation of gritty realistic proportions, building on the previous volume with almost majestic qualities. Fantasy styles and novels come and go, but I believe that &quot;The Song of Ice and Fire&quot; will stand the test of time and become a classic very soon.<br />Fantasy elements are kept in restraint at all times, this could almost be a historical novel set in the times of the English Wars of the Roses, but this makes it all the more better, as the whizz-bang of wizards, magic swords and the like are refreshingly missing. I haven't read a Fantasy novel for a long time that gets the sense of large countries and populations across realistically. Normally with an army of a few thousand and a handful of characters, the lead protagonist makes his move. Here armies' number in the hundreds of thousands and Martin has hundreds of well-placed, well thought out characters (with suitable family histories) in more than one location to back this up. Action takes place simultaneously with far distances separating places and people effectively. With literally hundreds of sub-plots, histories and motivations to go with it. Action is often brutal, bloody, dirty and realistic. Again I am reminded of the War of the Roses. The detail and description is heavy and rich without being dense and boring. Events keep you turning the pages and I am looking forward to the next volume. I cannot praise it enough.
B00004VW0W|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums I must say... it has the best love song that has ever been written...the perfect thing to play to a loved one...<br />Now although this album doesn't have many tracks... the first tracks 18 minutes seems to somewhat pay back those other missing tracks. And it does it with style.<br />If I have five different versions on this album (The LP, Tape, Old CD Version and the New Limited Edition Pack version) then surly you aught to have one.

B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is on a path, and there's nothing more exciting in music than to be able to experience that path.  Kid A is the logical next step from OK Computer.  How could anyone have expected anything else?  The album is excellent, and a perfect sonic fulfillment of OK Computer's promise.  Radiohead is only one of two bands I can think of that has evolved so completely from pop to envelope-pushing art in a few short years. The other is Talk Talk.  Although the sound is different, if you enjoy the unstructured musical approach and diverse soundscape, check out their &quot;Laughing Stock,&quot; which EMI (who, coincidentally, publishes Radiohead) refused to publish nearly a decade ago.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is the one movie, with the exception of Dances With Wolves, that has the right to be three hours long. Why? Because there is not a weak moment in the film. Whether you are on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen to Wallace's wife, or analyzing the politcal tactics of Robert the Bruce as you slowly realize how much you are like him, the film never drags and only gets better.<br />Edward &quot;Longshanks&quot; is one of the most deplorable villains you will meet on the screen, and his son one of the most laughable. Sophie Marceau was the ideal choice for France's princess, and she plays the role of Wallace's patron and avenger with an obvious passion.<br />I can't see how someone could dislike this film unless it were out of pure cynicism. This is the kind of movie you buy, not rent. You're alone on a weekend, not doing anything - you can always watch one our day's greatest actors and filmakers portray one of history's greatest heroes.
0811826848|5.0|It's The Beatles! What else is there to say?
B00004XQP4|5.0|This new album is more similar to Nimrod than Dookie or Insomiac, but at times reminds me of my old favorite, Kerplunk.  Billie Joe was quoted as saying a while back that the lyrics were happier, but not Prozac happy.  Well said.  But I knew this album was going to be great.  I saw them at the Warped Tour over the summer and they stole the show by a lot.  Keep 'em coming, Green Day, and next time don't take so long.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. I enjoyed myself very much watching it. However, a few things must be set straight. The writiers of this film paid little attention to history. Commodus ruled for twelve years and began his reign qite ausipiciously, listening to the advisors of his father. The murder of Marcus Aurelius by his son is pure unfounded speculation by people with little historical conscience. Knowing full well the many historical errors of Gladiator, I must once again reiterate that despite these I loved the movie. It is indeed a very Roman movie. The ancient historians had no qualms about changing things up a bit here and there to make a few heros. The imagery of the field and the wheat is taken straight from the spirit of Rome and the pages of Livy, a Roman historian. The Romans themselves would have agreed that the character of Maximus was excellent. Of course, the special effects and the acting were good as well.
B000001E7L|5.0|Definitley the best album of the 1990's.The exquisite and angelic voice of Dolores O' Riordan had me listening again and again and again.<br />'Ode To My Family' has a universal beauty that most of us can relate to and 'The Icicle Melts' is another brilliant masterpiece that makes a hard hitting comment on another blight of modern society There is 'Yeats Grave' which is  great peace of Irish poetry itself and 'Daffodil Lament' another exquisite and poetic masterpiece.I kept going back to Dolores beautiful voice singing 'I have decided to leave you forever...oh ,and the daffodils look lovely today'
0780619951|5.0|Although &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; was intended as some sort of message to people attempting to change the course of human history, I thought it degenerated into a comedy in the mold of the &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot;. It has tragedy(Ash's girlfriend dies in the Evil Dead 2, in the same vain, Dr. Moreau is murdered by his creations, and Moreau's daughter is also killed by her father's creations), comedy(Ash's own hand gives him the finger in the Evil Dead 2, conversely, how can a person not find the little guy who dresses like Moreau hilarious, the scene where Moreau and the little guy are playing Chopin's &quot;Polonaise&quot; is unforgettable!), perhaps the only difference between the two is the setting and budget.<br />Whereas the Evil Dead 2 operated on a low budget, the producers of this movie had an infinite amount of money to work with, which accounts for the prescence of the great Marlon Brando, and the always &quot;cool&quot; Val Kilmer, and of course, the superb special effects. As opposed to being a &quot;sci-fi thriller&quot;, this is a kind of a strange and unusual comedy, nonetheless, I would suggest you purchase this movie(as opposed to renting!) when you recieve the opportunity. Any lover of movies owns the Evil Dead 2, and any lover of movies should own the movie that is the Evil Dead 2's equal, &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;. Furthurmore, Brando gives a superb performance(doesn't he always!), and as for Val Kilmer, I'm at odds trying to think of a description of his performance, I suppose &quot;Awesome&quot; will suffice. In conclusion, the &quot;Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; is a great movie, but not in the way the Godfather or Spartacus was great, more like the way the Evil Dead 2 and the 3 Monty Python films were great.
B00004U8P9|5.0|They really did a top-notch job with this one- the menus alone are awesome with the freaky talking lips making comments.  I haven't even covered everything yet, but from what I've seen it's great.<br />The commentary is a lot of fun- two of the cast members Richard O Brian (guy who plays Riff-Raff also creator of Rocky Horror) and Patricia Quinn team up with lots of informative and fun information on the making of the film and the extremely tight budget.<br />The other commentary boosts a real audience's taunts and insults at the screen- like watching Mystery Science Theater without the fun robots..., but most of the yelling is hard to make out, but when you DO hear it's friggen hilarious, especially during the musical numbers where the audience have some cruel verses of their own.  In another feature you can actually watch the audience dancing in the theater and acting out the scenes with a click of the mousepad.  You'll see- I'm trying to make this clear, but there's too many things to mention!<br />Also have a prompter to cue you if you want to do the audience participation thing.  The documentary is very good- the VH1 interviews are nice and lengthy- I really appreciated the honesty through the cast and how they'll admit that it wasn't THAT pleasant of an experience- a lot of the conditions were barely tolerable.<br />The outtakes stink- pointless and boring- none of them slightly funny- they're just alternate takes they didn't use...oh well, everything else makes up for it.  There's trivia, only 7 or 8 photos, but no big deal.  Theatrial trailers.  Alternate ending with the cut &quot;Superheroes&quot; song...I can see why they cut it, but it's nice to see anyway.  Also another number that &quot;Brad&quot; sings, but it's also pointless and boring.  They were smart to keep this stuff out and smart to put it on the dvd.<br />Spanish subtitles, Anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1) great sound and pic quality- didn't spot any serious or distracting flaws.<br />DVD games too, which I haven't quite figured out yet, some trivia, cast filmograpies/biographies, a guide to audience participation, a nifty little Rocky Horror timeline, web links...hmm- probably forgetting something.  The U.K. and U.S. version of the film are here too with the &quot;Superheroes&quot; number in the U.K. version...I guess that's it- need I say more?  Great buy- I'm stoked!s too, which I haven't quite figured out yet, some trivia, cast filmograpies/biographies, a guide to audience participation, a nifty little Rocky Horror timeline, web links...hmm- probably forgetting something.

B000002572|5.0|This debut Boston CD is arguably one of the greatest Rock N' Roll albums of all-time.  It's a safe bet to say it is in the Top 10 without a doubt.  This album is pretty much anything good Boston ever did--but that's besides the point.  This album is mesmorizing with such epic tracks as &quot;More than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;.  Other tracks such as &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Band&quot;, &quot;Hitch a Ride&quot;, &quot;Something About You&quot;, and &quot;Let me Take You Home Tonight&quot; still have heavy rotation on classic rock stations.  This is a must for any rock fan, classic, or modern.  Certainly a timeless classic that has set the standard for Rock N' Roll for decades to come.
B00004XONN|5.0|I've been a Radiohead fan for a few years.  I got OK Computer shortly after its release, and picked up The Bends not long after that.  Since then, I have been waiting with great excitement for the new album.<br />Now it's here, and it was without any doubt worth the wait.  It's actually good enough, different enough, _evolved_ enough, that comparisons to previous efforts are basically worthless.<br />Kid A is one of the best albums ever made.  Period.  I've made three attempts to explain why, and have erased each one; they were all inadequate.  You can read any professional review of the album, and find out that it is more electronic than their other albums, or that it's more experimental, or that there aren't any &quot;pop&quot; tunes on it.  But what that almost neglects to say is, you don't really miss the swooping guitars and the epic pop-structured tunes.  Their electronic and/or processed replacements take the music to places that the Big Guitar Sound just cannot go.  It takes the drama down a bit, but loses none of the emotion or sincerity of the older albums.  Those beats and beeps put you in the place that Radiohead wants you to be better than even the big guitars ever did.<br />The album is simply amazing.  If you don't own it, you should.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Well, how do they keep doing it. Four albums down the track and Green Day still seem to be able to produce the infectious in-your-face rock that keeps fans coming back for more. Like some of the worlds greatest bands e.g. Matchbox 20, Metallica, Green Day seem to be able to maintain their original sound and style whilst still expanding their performing media. If you buy one album this year buy this one. From the infectious and at times violent chords of the very in your face &quot;Minority&quot; to the laid back acoustic strumming rhythms of &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;, from the almost greek sounding &quot;Misery&quot; to the smooth rock of &quot;Warning&quot; the boys keep their original sound and style going right throughout. Even the impeccable humour is present with lines like &quot; Wake up the house is on fire, and the cat's caught in the dryer&quot; as heard on &quot;Deadbeat Holiday&quot;. It Rocks!
B00004XONN|5.0|Let's talk about Radiohead. Let's talk about how different Pablo Honey (wretched) is compared to The Bends.  Remember how you were blown away by them disovering a voice? Then remember the leap between that and OK Computer.  Remember how everyone hailed them as coming into their own and they seemed to finally find a polished sound?  Now...Remember when you predicted what you thought Kid A would sound like? a more polished version of OKC perhaps? Different yes, but still OKC. Kid A is not, and for all the people that jumped on the bandwagon when OKC came out, I think they will be disappointed.  There's as much of a jump between OKC and Kid A as between any of their other albums.  But it's not sonic bombast rock gods. it's much more....furniture music...BUT THAT'S GOOD! Some might say Radiohead is testing people by changing so much, but I think that isn't it at all.  I think they have much more experimentation to do and this album is just the beginning, just proof that they won't sit still once they've reached commercial success. It's kind of like the move the Smashing Pumpkins made.  How to follow up the monumental Mellon Collie w/ anything but Adore? How to get beyond OKC? make a quiet experimental album. Unfortunately NO ONE liked Adore except me, and the band plummeted in flames.  This won't happen to Radiohead, but I love them for doing just the opposite of what everyone expected.   You may listen to this album and say what is this? is it music? what do you call the actual song &quot;Kid A&quot;? It's music, but in that subtley pretentious yet lovable Radiohead way, MORE than just &quot;popular music.&quot;
B00004XONN|5.0|On &quot;KID A,&quot; Radiohead continues to explore the dark terrains of alienation heard on 1997's seminal &quot;OK COMPUTER&quot;, but this new work sounds as if it were recorded on a spaceship set adrift in some strange, uncharted maelstrom at the end of the world.  The songs slither down long, flourescent corridors and twist through midnight computer-rooms on their way to the human heart.   Thom Yorke's voice is often muffled and distorted as if his throat were stuffed full of cold wires, but it is a tribute to his gifts as a vocalist that nearly every note hits the right  emotional pitch.  Forget Sinatra, we're in hell now and these songs are sung for the dead.   Listen to &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; and try to predict where Yorke will go next.  The song starts as a mournful pulse consisting of Yorke's catatonic, almost-but-not-quite off-key delivery, an acoustic guitar and a gentle drum beat and proceeds to build, with the help of swirling synthesizers, to an conclusion so suffused with loss and loneliness, it makes anything on &quot;OK COMPUTER&quot; sound like Matchbox 20 in a bad mood.   &quot;Idioteque,&quot; by far the band's fullest expression of it's techno tendencies, sounds like an Aphex Twin cut, but with warm, red blood pulsing under the spitting metal of the drum pattern.  &quot;Treefingers&quot; is pure Eno drone and the closer, &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; shines a lantern of hope through it's use of shimmering harps.  It is also one of the only tracks on which Yorke's voice is clean and unfettered.   In a musical world completely sucked dry by the preening vulgarity of MTV and it's flashy, whorish presentation of all that's banal and untalented, Radiohead and &quot;KID A&quot; are a beacon of dark, strange things to come.  Sure, it might be cold, sad and lonely here at the bottom, but it's better than being at the top with Papa Roach.

B00004XONN|5.0|ok. when the popheads stop whining, i will continue. this is amazing. the way that previous radiohead moved was more powerful than just about anybody, and this has that same power to it, if not more. yeah, sure, it's over the heads of the little girls, but does any MUSICIAN care? this is the most original and shaking album i think ive ever heard, and thank god it's not going to be on the pop charts! hold this album close, don't let it get away, and really listen to it worth way more than 20 bucks!!!!!
B00004XONN|1.0|so bad, i can hardly listen.  but i do, because radiohead is a great band with great records, and i hope to find something enjoyable about the record.  very difficult to listen to, especially in the car.  maybe bonghits may help, but for now incredibly disappointed.  the art crowd, i'm sure, loves this record, but why, i'll never know.  you don't have to say you like a record beacuse it pushes the envelope or because you like the band.  remember &quot;wowee zowee&quot;, my friends.
B00004R99J|5.0|Disney deserves a standing ovation for this one- superlative in all its elements, especially in its musical score (Alan Menken, can we ever sing your praises too loudly?) this is one of the most emotionally moving features produced by Disney in its entire history.  The greatest strength in this solid tale of history and fantasy is the hero herself, Pocahontas.  There have been numerous unforgettable Disney heroines: Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Esmerelda, Mulan, etc.  NONE of these, howver, can compare to Pocahontas, so outstandingly is she depicted.  Glen Keane's animation of this landmark toon creation is brilliant, and coupled with a sensitive voice performance courtesy Irene Bedard, Pocahontas becomes an institution all her own.  The remaining characters are sufficiently developed, but are poor shadows in compariosn to this virtuoso peace maker.  The animation is eye-popping and stunning, especially in the sequence &quot;Just Around The River Bend&quot; and the film's closing moments.  Stephen Schwartz's penned love song to nature, &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;, is arguably the greatest Disney ballad of all time.  Judy Kuhn deserves special mention for her resplendent vocals which careen effortlessly over Menken's score and through Schwartz's words.  The film deals exclusively with the notions of white supremacy, manifest destiny, and British sovereignty, though there are more than a handful of good English folk around (only authoritative figures like the King and Ratcliffe are depicted as outright scum- and even that is done in a realistic manner- we are not dealing with an over-the-top Ursula here, delightful as she undoubtedly is).  Parents should be prepared to answer plaintive questions about the historical development of America and the inevitable truth that Native Americans were displaced by white settlers.  It is truly wonderful that Disney has opted to tell a story that questions bigotry and racism (you could even call this an anti-war drama) and for that alone we thank them.
0811826848|5.0|Wow! Where do I begin? This fascinating book contains intimate details on every aspect of The Beatles career - from start to finish. Comments from John, Paul, George and Ringo are frank, engaging and often very funny. The photographs are from the Beatles own private collection and some of them are really amazing...<br />It's worth every cent.
0670824399|5.0|It's odd to consider how black and white letters can entrench the imagination and carry one off to nether realms of all-encompassing possibilty.  That is PRECISELY what happpens when one sits down with Roald Dahl's unforgettable &quot;Matilda&quot;.  It ranks among his very best work, arguably the best story he's constructed for readers of all ages.  This story was first released back when I was in fifth grade- it quickly became my constant companion- on the bus on the way to school, on the bus on the way home- my nose was buried deep among Dahl's magical words.  When I picked up the story again recently (in part due to the euphoria surrounding the Hary Potter phenomenon) I found the story as brilliant as ever- there are few &quot;children's&quot; books which stand the test of time (those of us who have tried reading Ramona into adulthood can attest to this) and Matilda is perhaps the best example of a timeless tale in modern times.  If you are a child, read it every day for a year and I promise it will not grow tiresome.  If you are an adult, read it once, and you will long again to be a child so you could read it every day for a year without wanting to put it away.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you're looking for another &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; or even &quot;The Bends&quot; then get to clicking your browser's back button.  The music on Kid A shows even more of the progession that Radiohead displayed on OK Computer.  This is not just some typical band that finds a formula and uses it until they die.  The band has evolved over time and so has the music.<br />First off, I would descibe this album as a sort of atmospheric electronic wonderland.  It sneaks up on you.  As a matter of fact, the whole album does.  It neither comes in or goes out with a bang, but it leaves a lasting impression.  The opening track, &quot;Everything In Its Right Place,&quot; opens quietly and slowly builds.<br />One standout track is &quot;Optimistic.&quot;  If I were to rate the songs on this album, it would most likely be at the top of my list.  Another song that really caught my ear was &quot;Idioteque,&quot; which is the antithises of what most people think of as a &quot;Radiohead sort of song.&quot;  While it is very minimalist with an artificial beat behind it and no guitars whatsoever, it just sounds right.  The least expected song on the album but also one of the best.<br />My recommendation for anyone would be to buy this disc if you want something besides power pop.  Radiohead is one of the last bands that is in it for the art more than the money and is still successful.<br />If you are looking for a repeat of earlier successes, then you are not looking for this album.  It is for those that want something different, a taste of things to come.
0887306667|5.0|This book was required reading in one of my all-time favorite university classes, entrepreneurship.  That was my first contact with the 22 Laws, and I have never been sorry.  Not only has the knowledge come in useful as I try to market my own small service business, but I can see how other companies have applied (or ignored) the Laws, and what the outcome has been.<br />  THE GOOD: 1) Rather than reading like a textbook, this clever work is more like a small handbook of essential marketing ideas.  Its 132 pages are divided up into 22 very readable chapters of about 4-5 pages each.  It is very easy to take in a chapter at any time and still learn an invaluable lesson about some aspect of catching your prospect's eye.  2) After each chapter I found myself really thinking about the concept, and trying to figure out how I could apply it to my situation.  The chapters have enough great information that they really can be considered little packets of motivation.  And who doesn't want more motivation to go and make his or her product (or service) even better?  3) Scattered throughout the book are some really great and inspiring examples of companies that have used the 22 Laws to their advantage.  The chapter on the Law of Candor explains how Avis effectively played off of its campaign that it was the number 2 rental car company.  The Law of Focus talks about how FedEx succeeded by focusing on small packages and overnight delivery.  The Law of the Mind shows how Apple computers beat out the Altair 8800 in the late 70's.  <br />  THE BAD: I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I can see some areas that other people may not find too attractive.  For example, 1) There are no specifics about how to apply each law to your situation, or even how to go about applying it.  It is left entirely up to you to see how the law fits your situation, and how you are going to apply it.  2) This book is written like a How-to-win-at-Chess book.  It is about the mental dueling that goes on in themarketing world.  If you are not into marketing or how to mentally outwit your competition - then you may not like this book.<br />  If you like marketing, clever and witty ideas or the kind of thrill that comes from playing chess then this book is for you!  Sure to become a business classic, this book is worth every bit of time and energy spent investing in its powerful concepts.
B00004XONN|4.0|I bought this cd the day it came out, I don't know why, I don't even consider myself a Radiohead fan but I just had an urge to get it. I hadn't heard any of the new songs either, but I'm glad I bought it. When I first listened to this cd I thought &quot;what the hell is this?&quot; filled with futuristic buzzes and sudden bass. Then I listened to it as I went to bed, this is the greatest bed time cd I own, its so dreamy. I then realized that to get to that OK COMPUTER sound, you just have to search. There are about 5 songs that I like on this cd (so far)if you plan on buying this cd, give it a chance, dont skip through every song, let the whole thing play straight through. The songs I like the most (as much as songs like Airbag and Paranoid Android are...&quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, &quot;Optimistic&quot;, &quot;Idioteque&quot; (which I think is the best song on the album) and &quot;Morning Bell&quot; all in all this is a great cd, don't let the weird sounds throw you off, give it a chance. Besides, if you don't like it, I'm sure if you listen to it over and over again, you'll eventually get used to it.
B000002UKS|4.0|This Cd is complete! With harder songs like &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; and down to one of the easier song, &quot;Everlong&quot;, you don't get tired of listening. The song that I bought the Cd for, &quot;My Hero&quot;, doesn't get old even with all the play it's gotten lately. This Cd is as complete as anybody could expect. The three songs I mentioned above were all played at their concert that I saw. They are considered some of Foo Fighters bests, which is something huge to say.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have been highly anticipating this release since sometime around April or May, which was the orignal rumored release time.  I have only become a Radiohead fan within the past year but it didn't take long.  After hearing OK Computer and the Bends, I was hooked and realized that Radiohead is one of the most interesting bands around today.  I did wonder if they could follow up the powerful OK Computer with a good album though.  Well, they did it, and they did it so much better than I could have expected.  From the minute I put my headphones on for the first listening, I was mesmerized by the unbelievable sounds that this album brought forth.  Thom Yorke doesn't sing nearly as much in this album, but when he does, it is awe-inspiring.  I think his vocal in &quot;How to Dissapear Completely&quot; is his most impressive to date.  I could go in to depth about each song, but that would take entirely too long.  Overall, the album is very dark, with warnings of an &quot;ice age coming&quot; , but ends in the optimistic &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; where Thom says that &quot;maybe I'll see you in the next life.&quot;  This album must be listened to from start to finish to be completely appreciated.  If you are looking for elements of The Bends here, then look elsewhere, guitars are sparse.  If you are willing to  expect the unexpected, be prepared for an amazing journey through wonderful sounds and concepts.
B00004XONN|5.0|Can Radiohead make a bad album? Answer: Nope!<br />After their last effort (the most revered rock album of the 90s ,OK Computer) they have produced another amazing album.  It isnt the epic sweepy music that filled OK Computer.  It is definitely a more subdued album.  Besides The National Anthem, no one song stands out like OK Computer's Paranoid Android or Karma Police as something that could stand alone from the record.  But what they do acheive in this album is 50 minutes of music that holds together perfectly as a whole.  There is a very unique mood that flows from song to song. Dissidant sounds from the organs and synthesizers match with Greenwood's guitars and Yorke's vocals.  Basically they put &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot;  Definitely the best album I have heard this year.
B00004XONN|5.0|In the last few days I have been listening to this record over and over, compulsively. It is constantly astonishing, each time I find some different facet. They play with production - the beginning is almost claustrophobic, vocals dry and two inches from your face, later there are periods of ambient drift, freeform jazz-horns squalling even grand balladry, though not to the panoramic scale of The Bends or OK Computer. The lyrics are elusive and fragmentary, as are the melodies (in fact it took me a couple of listens before I realised that most of the melodies were there at all). In fact the album is heavy with broken and impossible communication - the word that kept popping into my brain when I heard it was &quot;autistic&quot;. <br />A number of reviewers on the Amazon.co.uk site bemoan the lack of guitars and riffage and Proper Songs, but I don't. This is the third majestic album by the only major band in Britain making records for now (rather than the sixties or seventies - the mythical Golden Age that everyone else is genuflecting to). <br />The album it reminds me most of is Scott Walker's masterpiece Tilt, if only for the way that it divided people between those who thought it was a total waste of plastic and those who thought it one of the best. <br />On many &quot;Greatest Albums Ever&quot; lists recently, both of Radiohead's last two albums regularly appear near the top. This album will not be joining them, although it deserves to.<br />Superb. Astounding. The real McCoy.<br />Look out for the hidden booklet.
B00004W50Z|3.0|Richard Manuel does NOT sing &quot;Stage Fright&quot; on this cd. It is sung by the inimitable Rick Danko (may they both rest in peace).
6305657939|5.0|Plot: great. Mystery: fantastic. Characters: sexy. Score: lush.<br />One of the smartest, funny movies I've seen in a long time. I've watched this one three times and haven't tired of it. If you haven't rented it, do so, tonight!
B00004XONN|5.0|&quot;Kid A&quot; is an absolutely beautiful work of art. In fact, if it weren't for Radiohead's previous album &quot;OK Computer&quot;, this would be my favorite &quot;rock&quot; album of the last decade.<br />I'm not a sucker for Radiohead, be warned. A lot of their earlier work was a bit too morose for my tastes. So now you know you're hearing not from some Radiohead &quot;fan boy&quot;, but a real music fan with a broad taste in music.<br />So, what does the album sound like? Just as Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; incorporated elements of techno into her music so does Radiohead swallow up electronic music with &quot;Kid A&quot;, although in a manner not as blatant and tacky as Madonna's effort.  Kid A sounds like a brilliant rock album that has been dipped into a rich vat of sweet-sounding digital filters and distortions. What we are left with is an extremely listenable (immediately so), major work of modern pop music. Thom Yorke's pained and delicate voice guide is like an old friend guiding us through a new and fantastic sound.<br />This song easily meets my &quot;Rule of 3&quot;. That is, it has 3 great songs on it which make it worth purchasing. In fact, it has more than just 3 but some of the highlights are &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; (my vote for song of the year), &quot;Treefingers&quot; (headphone material here, folks), and the satisfying &quot;Optimistic&quot;, a track that you can play in your car to your friends and you'll have them singing along to it before the song is over.<br />This album is most certainly worth your [money] even if you're not a huge Radiohead fan. This is the best rock album in the past several years.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you've been waiting for the next phase of Radiohead then here it is. Allot more electronic, less guitar work, and pushing the envelope once more. When I listened to OKC(okay computer) it took about a month and a cold rainy day before I could enjoy it. Well I'm not sure if \\"Kid A\\" can live up to \\"OKC\\". You don't think of Radiohead when you think of ambient music nor do you connect them with a hard backbeat. Don't get me wrong I like this CD but if you can't make the strech then maybe you should rethink this purchase. If you're hooked on \\"The Bends\\" and you were disappointed with OKC, then you are definitely not ready for this installment of the evolution of the band.<br />Now if your ready for the ride, you're in for a treat. Psychedelic electronic jazz rock fusion which Frank Zappa would be proud to call his own. I gave this 4 stars but this could be a three or a five depending on how high on life I am.<br />Take the challenge and listen.
0425156842|5.0|I cannot say enough about the incredible presentation of history and philosophy that Gaarder has given us through Sophie's World. The plot is weak and lacks depth, but that simply does not matter. It's enough to keep you reading page after page of enthraling insight into figures in history who changed their world and impacted ours. I reccomend this book to anyone with a love for history or philosophy. Sophie's World will shed light on the unknown and make you quesiton it. A must read for the curious.
6305807043|5.0|Being John Malkovich.<br />This film starts off quite ordinarily, nothing really mad or weird happens.  Its just the story of an unemployed puppeteer (a very good one too, the stuff he does is amazing! - played by John Cusack), who has to get a job in a filing company, filing files.  His office is on floor 7½ of a building, has low ceilings, and tiny doors.  Now the comedy begins.<br />Next he discovers a small door leading into what looks like a cave, he crawls in, and suddenly, he IS John Malkovich.  Fifteen minutes later, hesuddenly get thrown onto a turnpike outside of town! Now it does begin to get mad and weird, but in a good and even convincing way.  His wife - Cameron Diaz - is a dowdy frizzy haired animal lover, who wants to try it.  She loves it so much she decides that she has discovered the inner man in her, and wants to have corrective surgery!  (She wants to discuss the procedure with her doctor, an allergist!)   Malkovich begins to suspect, and.....well, I'd better not give away too much, but plenty of fairly strange and funny stuff happens.  Often you'll laugh out loud, other times you'll simply be amazed with an unexpected turn of events, but always you'll be sitting up and paying attention!<br />The plot of this film is unusual, to say the least, but it really pays off if you can suspend your disbelief so that you can into the film.  OK, so portals into other people's heads don't really exist, but if they did......  The acting is superb, John Cusack is very good, but Cameron Diaz is just incredible as his dowdy wife (even though I knew she was in the film, it was some time before I realised that the wife was her, so looked so different).  Also, John Malkovich playing John Malkovich is really something to see - you get to see him doing all sorts of humdrum things as himself (ordering stuff from a catalogue, eating breakfast,  having a shower....) and he discusses his problems with other showbiz people who play themselves as well.  The ending is good, with a little twist that surprises right at the end.<br />Overall, this is a really funny and surreal, but very accessible film.  Definitely one of the best of the year, it really stands out from the usual offerings of action, love and sci-fi that turn up regularly nowadays.  My advice:  get this film.
630157401X|5.0|Again, a wonderful movie, along with this one the jokes, action, and wild last-second ideas.  I loved it!   It's my favorite out of all three Indiana Jones movies.  The part about his youth is hilarious as well!
158234082X|1.0|This book came to my attention as a review from Amazon, probably because I buy a lot of cook books. <br />About 1/3 of the way through, and one typo to many I realised it needed an editor. 2/3 of the way through I realised it needed a writer too. Pages of patois curses and their meanings. Of what relevance is this to restaurants really? Dated anecdotes of trivial New York decadence. Ethnic stereotyping. Sexism. Some very odd anachronisms.  A few good pages here and ther on food and cooking. Not enough to warrant the price or time spent reading it.<br />Ersatz gonzo journalism is both obsolete and out of date. Shame Amazon! For a few dollars you lauded this woefully inadequate book and  now I can't ever trust your reviews again. <br />00000
B00004XONN|5.0|With the traditional sense of album-making behind them, Radiohead takes in a new direction with Kid A.  Thom Yorke's vocals are scattered throughout the album, and there isn't one traditional song on this album.  Instead, there is a continuous harmony that flows beginning to end, making the record seem like one long musical piece.  Somewhat like an opera.  The instruments take the forefront on this album and the voice of Yorke is more of a highlighting element.  If this were a movie, the instrumental music would be the visual element and Yorke's vocals would be the score.       Through multiple listenings, this album takes on a life of its own and is unrelated in every way to the bands other 3 albums.  Nothing is radio-friendly here, there are no potential singles, just one experience that comes from listening to the record as a whole.
B00004X01U|4.0|Well, I have been a Madonna fan since she first hit the scene.  Over the years she has put out many good tunes, but her albums (along with her voice) became more sophisticated as she matured. This album, although it has a few redeeming tunes, is a step backward for the material girl.  The repetitive lyrics are empty and leave a lot to be desired.  With her new found &quot;enlightenment&quot; I had hoped for a little more substance and not just a bunch of techno mumble jumble.  Of course, I give this 4 stars because even the worst of Madonna is better than most.
0811826848|5.0|I've just received this book and I am absolutely mesmerized with it. Awesome photos, most of them previously unseen; a fantastic graphic project, which illustrates very properly each phase of Beatles career. Beautiful package for one of the most incredible stories in the entertainment world. A must read for everyone who is interested in the life and the times of the Fabs. Someone could complain about the lack of new and/or &quot;spicy&quot; information, but I think that it's not so important. This is the &quot;official&quot; version, so, don't expect some of &quot;Giuliano&quot;s kind of thing. Its pure fun and entertainment!
B00004XONN|5.0|A few words come to mind when thinking of this album: stark, beautiful, stunning, amazing.  Radiohead have progressed over the years and few albums in the past 5 years can come close to this one.  Just buy this and be amazed.  Buy this, close your eyes and listen.
B00004XQP4|3.0|This is the only review that you will read from an actual green day fan.  If you are a green day fan I don't really recommend this cd.  It's good but not half as good as their older cd's.  My main problem w/ the cd, other than it being too different than earlier green day cd's, was that mike dirnt doesn't play bass as crazy as in all of the other albums.  He plays almost exactly the same riff as billie joe on half the tracks..  If you never liked Green day before you'll probably love this album, but a green day fan (a real green day fan) may be dissapointed.
B00004XONN|4.0|Well, my friends.  Here it is.  A handy checklist to see if you qualify for the &quot;Kid A&quot; experience.<br />1: Do you attend Radiohead concerts and request the song, &quot;Creep&quot; at the top of your lungs? 2: Do you still call your local radio station and request &quot;anything off the bends&quot;? 3: Do you/Have you ever just &quot;hung out&quot; at the mall, because you &quot;enjoy the atmosphere&quot;? 4: Do you think every film made before 1990 is &quot;cheesy&quot;? 5: Have you ever considered athletics as a profession? 6: Do you own anything from Ambercrombie? 7: Have you ever jammed on the air guitar to a Ratt record?<br />If you answered &quot;Yes&quot; to any of the above questions... DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!  This is not... I REPEAT... NOT... &quot;The Bends&quot;.  This is off the wall, confusing, cold, intense, mind-numbing music.  And, quite possibly, this is the most frustrating album of the year.<br />HAVING SAID THAT:  If you adore quality, intelligent, thought-provoking, interesting, surprising, often-brilliant music... feel free to place this one in your shopping cart, because you will enjoy it.  This is, undoubtedly, one of the best albums ever created, but it is not a normal Radiohead album.  It is almost completely devoid of guitar.  Instead, organs and drum machines permiate the minimalistic soundscapes.  Thom Yorke's trademarked, edge-of-an-emotional-breakdown vocals have been stripped of their human qualities and replicated with robot precision.  And Phil, the wonderful drummer, must be very confused when he tries to figure out where he actually plays on this album.<br />Highlights Include:  &quot;Idioteque&quot; with its Aphex Twin heartbeat rhythm and amazing melody.  The way &quot;Morning Bell&quot; morphs from a bedroom demo to a full out, chaotic musical masterpiece.  How &quot;Everything in it's right place&quot; twists those little shivers down your spine with its sampled, wordless vocals.  And, how &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; takes you to another planet, where heartbreak breathes the same as oxygen.<br />I love this album, but it took me several listens to fully enjoy it.  I had to give in, and accept that this is indeed a Radiohead album.  That this is indeed music for the modern era.  It's both inviting and dangerous.  Beautiful and Abrasive.  The only reason it doesn't receive five stars is the lull in the middle, where the atmospheric, instrumental &quot;Treefingers&quot; and going-nowhere &quot;In Limbo&quot; made me lose interest momentarily.  Other than that... Buy it.  Sit Back.  And Enjoy with the headphones.<br />And, oh.  See you at the mall.
0767903854|5.0|Bryson has done again. Yet, another enjoyable comical/historical essay writen by a travel liturature genious. In this book bryson talkes about Australia from top to bottom. From land to sea and back again. He doesnt leave out a thing, he even hits upon the tender subjects revolving around the horrible treatment the aborigines have recieved over the years, and still ocassionally recieve yet today.And even while talking of such a serious subject as racism he still manages to make this an extremly funny and enlightening romp threw a sunburned country. In short I highly recomend this book.<br />P.S. I am not a historian, nor am I a human rights activist I just simply enjoyed this book verry much.
B00004XQP4|4.0|This is their best album yet!  I was surprised when I heard the accordian and other instruments which, in the past, were not in their music.  Their sound is quite different compared to their last albums.  If it were not for Billy Joe singing, you would not even know it was Green Day by the sound of the music.  It's just awesome!  I guess you could say it's still punk, but with a twist mabe?  And since they have seemed to clean up their language quite a bit (at least on this album), it's even better.  If you wanna know what I mean by punk with a twist, you should get the album :-)
B00000253N|5.0|Musically and lyricaly it reaks of honesty, which is what makes Dylan a great artist. The songs featured on this landmark album are smooth and earpleasing. If you've never liked Dylan and you haven't had the privalege to listen to this paticular masterpeice, give it a listen. You'll find yourself singing the praises of this man's great talent.
B000001GRE|5.0|A musician once said, &quot;there are no great conductors, only great orchestras.&quot;  Since the recording industry has quite forgotten the Bamberg Symphony altogether, we've all been fortunate enough to still be bestowed with marvelous orchestral playing such as Cleveland's on this disc. What color! What richness! What virtuosity! This isn't the emotional trauma of Solti's, or the banality of Ozawa's. This is playing that equals the Chicago perf with Abbado's, the Frankfurt perf with Inbal as well as CBSO's with Rattle. I haven't heard the SanFrancisco disc yet, but if you buy this one first before you hear the work live, you won't be disappointed. Excellent!!!

B00004XONN|5.0|Three years is a long time to wait for a follow-up to one of the best albums of all time.  Radiohead has succeeded again with the mellow, dramatic &quot;Kid A.&quot;  Less rock oriented than &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; or even &quot;OK Computer,&quot;  this album is reminiscent of a very early, very experimental, Pink Floyd.  The songs are melodic and mysterious, and gently lead the listener on a journey into a lesser explored genre of avant garde music.  In a world of predictability and the boredom that arises as a result, this album is a refreshing reminder that great music still exists, and that true artists are never afraid of taking risks...
0684830485|5.0|Hemingway's magnificent novel has something for everyone:  an action tale, an anti-war protest, a love story, subtle ironies, a magnificent short story within the novel, political criticism of communism and fascism, a philosophy of life, and beautiful descriptions of life that leave you gasping.  You will learn a lot about yourself by considering which elements you notice most strongly.  Reading For Whom the Bell Tolls is like holding up a mirror to your soul.<br />On the surface this is a book about 3 days and nights of war.  But with the action packed into that time and extensive use of flashbacks, it becomes a tapestry of all humankind.  After you start to notice the individual threads in the tapestry, be sure to step back and see the whole.  For the remarkably balanced and connected artistry of the themes and directions in the story is what makes this book great.<br />If you are disturbed by descriptions of violence, brutality, and inhumanity, you will not enjoy this book.<br />Robert Jordan is an American who has joined the republican side of the Spanish civil war.  In normal life, he teaches Spanish.  Now, he is transformed into a demolitions expert who can blow up trains and bridges.  With an offensive coming, he moves behind the fascist lines to join a guerilla group to blow a key bridge during an offensive that begins in 3 days.  The rest of the story covers the action of preparing for and attacking the bridge.  Along the way, you will become acquainted with the characters in the guerilla band as well as Jordan.  Jordan will find himself moved in many ways to become more alive and fully connected than he has ever been before.  He will experience the full range of human emotion and life within these 3 days.<br />If you don't know about the Spanish Civil War, you should be aware that it was the main warm-up for World War II.  The fascists under Franco were supported by Hitler and Mussolini.  Hitler wanted to try out his new weapons and fine-tune tactical theory before attacking the rest of Europe.  Communists from around the world flocked to the republic, as did pro-democracy volunteers.  The republican forces had great popular support but had little war materiel and fought a losing campaign that created great anguish in the international community.<br />Civil wars are one of the worst forms of human conflict.  Because the people are so much alike, they tend to behave with greater savagery towards one another.  With modern weapons of mass destruction, the effects can be awful beginning with the American Civil War.  Hemingway does a great job of showing the essential sameness of the forces on both sides in human terms, and takes away the meaning of their causes to show the greater importance of their humanity.  The book reminds me in this aspect very much of All Quiet on the Western Front, the great ant-iwar novel about trench warfare in World War I.<br />As is usual with Hemingway, the writing is spare, effective, and graceful.  Stylists will be delighted!<br />Why should you read this book today?  You will probably not fight in a civil war.  Or will you?  For in fact, humans are as divided in their competitions as ever.  They just normally don't involve bloodshed.  There is great glory in the conflict, but even greater potential in their cooperation.  Ask yourself about where you compete now and what could be accomplished if you focused on constructive cooperation instead.  Think about this concerning your family, your love, your work, your hobbies, and your volunteer activities.  Like the quote above, wherever there is one of us the other is present.  If you start to represent each other's interests and connect with one another, the sum of mankind is greater and so is each person.

0811826848|5.0|Make room on your bookshelf beside &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; and &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot; for The Beatles Anthology. If you're a rock 'n roller, you'll want to buy this book immediately--and possibly order one for a friend. No kidding--it's that good. You say there's nothing &quot;whot&quot; hasn't been writ about the Fab Four? Posh! This book is full of spicy trivia, from John Lennon's first ride around the block on his red tricyle when he was five, to Ringo's first experience using brushes. Did you know that it wasnt' until Rubber Soul that Ringo realized he was right-handed? It's true! This book is terrific.<br />Just skip the bits about Yoko and Julian's [sic] career.
B000006TRV|5.0|I'm not sure.  But I can say this, Pink Floyd The Wall is not Pink Floyd's best album.  Then why five stars you ask?  Because even mediocre Floyd is light years better than anything else out there.  The Wall is a sad album because it represents (for all intensive purposes) the end of Pink Floyd.  Sure they would release 1981's The Final Cut under the moniker Pink Floyd, but essentially it was Roger Water's first solo album.  The Wall has some mesmerizing moments such as the overlooked One of my Turns or the haunting beauty of Nobody Home.  The Wall combines a nice mixture of Gilmour's guitar work and Waters paranoid delusions concerning the government and society in general.  This is not light listening and I would not recommend it to the clinically depressed.  On another level, The Wall works better than most other double albums released with the exception of the Beatles White Album.  Most of the tracks are strong but overall The Wall is a little too grim for me to listen to on a regular basis.  There is little debate that The Wall is a rock masterpiece, I just don't think its Pink Floyd's.  P.S.  Check out the More soundtrack that just might be the best of the best.
0671027344|4.0|I found The Perks of Being a Wallflower when searching on Amazon for books similiar to The Catcher in the Rye.  I'm not going to tell you a lot of what the book is about.  Because you can just read the blurb if you want to find out.  But I'll just say that it answered a lot of questions for me.  And if you're at that point of your life (teenage years) where you feel like you're searching for something.  This book may be very insightful.  I closely related to the main character Charlie.  He's very innocent and brilliant.  And if you really enjoy those books/movies that don't really &quot;spell it out&quot; for you and make you have to dig a little, as I do, then you will enjoy this book.  I think that is mainly because it's written in letter form.  And because the person who's writing the letters doesn't presume to know everything about life, it takes you on his journey of knowledge.  And it will definetly make you look at life from a different angle.  So, yeah, I would certainly recommend it.
B00004XONN|3.0|There was lots of hype surrounding this album. Lots of people felt it was gonna be amazing, 'the event of the year'. Well, in my view, Radiohead have fallen short a little but this album is still well worth a listen. Yorke does things that he has never done before, his lyrics are all chopped up and moved around. I don't think any of the instruments here are actually acoustic, all of it sounds very techno based. Radiohead are experimenting with computer technology and the overall result is very good but nothing spectactualr. Out of the ten tracks plus the hidden 50 second instrumental, I only really enjoy five. They are Tracks 1,3,6,7, and 8. 6 and 8 especially, I feel these will go down as classic Radiohead songs. The others aren't awful, I just feel they consist of lots of great sounds with no real lyrical content which was what made 'OK Computer' so amazing. This album is still radiohead in many ways, Yorke's voice will still freak you out at times but on the whole he seems to have stopped being really creepy with his vocals. A solid record, not as good as 'OK Computer' or perhaps even 'the Bends', but still very much, Radiohead. A preview of what their music has become perhaps, check it out!
B00004XONN|3.0|OK Computer, the best CD of the 90's, and one of the best ever, is a though act to follow. I understand then why Radiohead wanted to use another approach. Like OK Computer, Kid A is groundbreaking and experimental. Unlike OK Computer, Kid A doesn't have any airplay-friendly pop qualities.<br />This is a CD for fans. Unfortunately. I hope their next work remains as smart as this, yet mainstream appealing as the others.<br />(One word to fans: The more expensive Book Edition of Kid A is NOT worth the price).
6305662371|5.0|The Exorcist is more then just a movie, it is an event, transcedent, powerful, but more importantly scary -- a film that is not afraid to touch upon images of true terror. <br />William Friedkin, a masterful filmmaker, takes horror filmmaking to a new level. With its deliberate pacing, solid performances, and startling visuals, the Exorcist remains a powerful film some 25 years after its original theatrical release.<br />This truly is the greatest horror movie of all time, bar none! <br />So turn off the lights, turn up the sound, and shudder at the only horror film worth watching -- The Exorcist!
B00004XQP4|4.0|If you like the Green Day vibe, your gonna dig this. The CD gets a little punk-a-billy once in a while, but it's pure GD. <br />It's got all the same ingredients from their previous CDs. Tight drums,Billy hitting those same 3 cords, and pounding smooth bass. I'm thinking Minority will be a huge hit. I'll keep it my CD player for a while, and even hit a couple songs to my Rio. All in all, the same GD nonsense, simple and catchy, but worth the ride.-Digitalshaw
B00004XONN|4.0|i'm still not quite sure if kid a is as good as ok computer.  but it took me awhile to appreciate ok computer as much as i do.  maybe it'll be the same with kid a.
079073804X|4.0|I truly, truly wish that I were around to see this movie when it first came out.<br />When it came out in the 1970's, much of the subject matter was taboo.  Unfortunately, when I saw the movie with a few friends of mine, we weren't scared at all.  The possessed scenes of poor Linda Blair cursing and making lewd comments that made people cringe back then do nothing now.  Society has changed so that nowadays, we hear that kind of language all the time, so a lot of the impact is lost.  So, throughtout the movie, I kept in mind that back then, this kind of thing was very rare to witness, and it helped a little.<br />Some parts DID make us jump, though, so it hasn't lost ALL of it's appeal.  Linda Blair does a wonderful job playing the poor girl that degrades from a innocent girl to the Devil himself, and the special effects are the best thing next to computer animation, so I give it four stars because it has good special effects, good acting...and hey, it's a classic!  So go on and try it out.  After all, some adults from the 1970's STILL haven't watched it!  In fact, once The Exorcist is re-released into theaters this fall, I'm going to drag my mom down to watch it for the first time!
B000001FI7|5.0|If you like &quot;film noir&quot;, movies of shadow and fog, smoke-filled bars, the poetry of the beats, a gig at Pandora's Box, jazz and the psychedelic 60's, then this is the album for you.  Moving and emotional, &quot;the band from Portishead&quot; have created the definitive moody album.  My wife found her anthem in &quot;Glory Box&quot; and turned me on to this sound.  The &quot;Bristol Beat&quot; is adequately dubbed &quot;Trip Hop&quot; and why it hasn't caught on more feverishly in the United States is beyond me, but Portishead are not for everybody.  They are truely &quot;art&quot; in music, expressionistic and existential.  &quot;Dummy&quot; holds one small gem after another, each taking you to another dark corner of Beth Gibbon's psyche and Geoff Barrow's synchopated dominions.  Like Van Gogh, Portishead are passionate about their music.  They take their time spinning the art, and their creativity unfolds in multiple layers of moving sound and lyrics.  Adrian Utley, the bands guitarist, can cry tears on his strings like Floyd's David Gilmour or Stevie Ray Vaughan, or he can evoke the heart-pounding drumming of a Peter Gunn/James Bond riff, the haunting wail of Sergio Leonne's spaghetti westerns, or the smooth jazz versatility of Miles Davis and Dave Brubeck. Add to the mix Hip-Hop sampling of lost items like War and Johnny Ray, some discreet scratching and pops, and for good measure, make the sound emanate from a grainy old victrola with digital clarity.  You have a new art form in music, and it is Portishead.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I had heard that this album would be different than previous Green Day albums, so I went into the buying process knowing this already.  This album does not disappoint, not in the least.  If you are a hardcore punk fan, and only like Green Day for this, then don't buy this album.  If you are a true Green Day fan and liked Nimrod, or if you just appreciate good music, this is a must.
B00004XONN|5.0|With each successive album that Radiohead creates, the genius of their work shows through more and more.  From the moment I put this cd into the player, I was in a new, unexplored world of rock and roll.  More than being just 10 individual tracks on a cd, this album is an experience that lets you feel what Thom Yorke does as he sings.  With each additional listening, I love the album even more.  Since I received it, it has not left my cd player.  I especially love the songs &quot;Everything in it's Right Place,&quot; the beautiful &quot;How to Disappear Completely,&quot; and the electronica-esque &quot;Idioteque,&quot; though all of them deserve honorable mention, and even more so when the album is listened to straight through.  Radiohead are the only true rock stars in the music industry today, and I look forward to further releases. If you are into albums that you enjoy fully at first listen, and then slowly begin to like less and less, then don't buy this album, but if you want a great musical experience that will grow on you more every time you hear it, then please, buy it and enjoy.
B00003CX97|5.0|I found this movie to be excellent produced and the charaters played by the actors came to live on the screen.  This was a movie about tradgic times and places.  The senior man in the prisoner of war camp was given the opportunity to work with his capturers and make it possible to give his men a means of surviving the war with dignity and purpose.
B00004XONN|5.0|Like Bowie singing of Dylan, &quot;You stood behind a million pair of eyes and told them how they saw&quot;, so too radiohead...this album peers from our blurry and dazed eyes and lays a soundtrack for our confusion and loneliness. Thom Yorke sings &quot;It's not like a movie&quot; but if life were, radiohead would be writing it's soundtrack. Is it an easy album? Not by a long shot. Does it scare me? Yes, it scares me with it's movements across a spectrum of sounds, broken melodies, organic and computer beats, weeping strings, unenuciated lyrics and every concievable distortion of sound. Do I love it? Oh God yes. I'm tired of critics proclaiming radiohead as the saviors of rock. This is an album that pushes the boundaries of what a pop album can sound like but  also yearns to know if rock and, ultimately, the listener is worth  saving. I won't tell you about these songs. I won't try and describe some of the most brillant transitions from song to song I've ever heard or the haunting quality of near tears vocals that an almost indecipherable Yorke is able to achieve. The brillant bass lines or the chilling choral arrangement behind the too much harps on Motion Picture Soundtrack...the frantic horn blasts that rise up like a monstrous jazz band at the end of National Anthem leading into the delicate building want of How to Disappear Completely. If this review sounds confused it's because I am confused by this record. Confused and in love and sad and laughing with joy. That is what I want art to do and that is the power that radiohead has. Buy this record.

If there's a knot you seek, you'll find it here: plain knots and fancy knots, practical knots and magical knots, beautiful and ornamental knots---they're all here. Mr.Ashley's hand drawings make these knots easy to follow. There are hundreds of beautiful pen-and-ink drawings that depict the maritime life as well:from people to places to things. Clifford Ashley's love and mastery of his subject is evident on every page. For my money, this is the best book you will ever find about the subject of knots.
B000002J03|3.0|I used to like Led Zeppelin, but they've soured on me because it seems that many of their songs are &quot;borrowed&quot; or &quot;adapted&quot; from old blues songs.Imagine my disappointment.They really weren't that original at all.This album still has some good songs, but I can't really recommend any other albums to new listeners, except maybe Physical Graffitti.

B000021Y77|5.0|When I heard about this movie, I was skeptical because I'm not into foreign flicks and am not too crazy about reading subtitles either.  When I started watching it, I was so into it!  It took so many turns with the 3 different scenarios going on in this one situation.  I recommend this to just about anyone who likes unpredictable movies!
0553062182|5.0|This is a landmark book, a breakthrough book. It is truly original and much-needed. Only once before have I heard myself so accurately described, or felt so validated. And that was the Myers-briggs test. Many professionals who want to categorize us and label us neurotic and shy should read this book and Dr. Aron's revolutionary research. And of course, if you're an HSP,  you will benefit immensely. All of a sudden, everything makes sense, and you don't feel so alone in the world. You also recognize your gifts, and see the critics of the world in their true, rather limited garb. Or should I say vision? Thank you, Dr. Aron.
0060930187|5.0|I picked up this book on a lark and could not put it down. The dipiction of ester's decent and how she rose again kept me entralled to the very core. to read how she struggle and to dee how her life was touched me. Ester forced her readers to look inside themselves and made it clear that you are not to be afriad or look down on the characters in this book. Everyone of them had a reason and a purpose to complete and I would defnitly recoment that if you are looking for a good pice to read that Slyvia Platt is the way to go.
B00004Z511|5.0|This is by far the best Radiohead yet. If you need an album full of pop music this ain't it. If you need music that challenges the way you listen to music, evokes emotions, and makes you think this is one of the greatest cds out. On first listening you keep waiting for that one radio friendly song that never shows up but this disc gets better every time. There's somthing new around every corner of music each time you listen to it. It sends you to a deep part of your mind and turns you inside out. Simply put, beautiful. If you don't like this disc go listen to Britany Spears.
0811826848|5.0|This is THE book that all fans of The Beatles have been waiting for! To hear The Beatles themselves telling their story, from their perspective, is long overdue. This book is the only book that anyone needs to read about Beatles history. Who could tell it better? The photos are FABulous too! I feel like it is 1964 again!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|I...uh...hmmm.<br />This has to be the first album to leave me totally baffled.  Yet I give it five stars, for not only that reason, but also because Radiohead have managed to figure out how to get past the intensity of OK Computer.  They achieve this by way of not just taking the next logical step in progressive rock--the concept album--but in fact skewering it.  While OK Computer dove into the murky stories of dystopia, KID A (the title is supposedly what the first genetically cloned human would be named) seems to have been living there for quite some time.  There is in fact NO concept here, aside from aurally injecting us with what dystopia feels like, not just showing it.<br />I've heard OK Computer compared to the Beatles' white album.  If this is so, Kid A is the second disc, the darker, progressively-growing-stranger half.  Songs such as Everything In Its Right Place and The National Anthem achieve more as songs by their ability to fall apart on purpose, while the title cut, with its unintelligible lyrics, show the surreal sadness without actually needing to say anything.  How To Disappear Completely, my personal pick on this release, echoes Thom Yorke's exercise in bleakness with UNKLE, Rabbit In Your Headlights.  You almost want to believe he really doesn't exist.<br />Overall, this album takes some time getting used to.  Take the first listen lightly but with an open mind to progressive musical experimentation.  It took me until the third try to realize this is really a brilliant album.  This is certainly heady stuff, but nonetheless it's an album worth investigating.
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A is simply a great album. I was never a huge diehard Radiohead fan, I liked a lot (if not most) of their songs but never bought any of their previous albums but when I heard this album I just had to buy it. Listen to it youself and see what you think, but it has my vote.
B00004XONN|5.0|After stunning the world by changing from the sensitive rockers of The Bends into apocalyptic visionaries with OK Computer, Radiohead's 4th lp is yet another transformation and foray into new music territory.<br />Whether Kid A will have any resonance with the public is up for grabs. As a creation, however, I feel it is near perfect. The influences range from Can to Autechre to Godspeed You Black Emperor! and combine to create a sort of detached, ethereal background for Thom Yorke's searing lyrics. While OK Computer's terrain was marked with various guitar effects, this album uses loops, distorted vocal effects and otherworldly organs to create a sort of gauzy musical whirlpool, which contrasts sharply with the breaking-glass maelstrom of the previous LP.<br />While OKC stood as a testiment to an individual raging against dehumanizing technology, this seems to be technology's transformation in human hands. It now reflects our own mistakes. As Yorke sings in Optimistic, the ode to the shiny-eyed globalized and Darwinistic business world &quot;The big fish eat the little ones/not my problem give me some&quot; to thick swells of guitar, bass, drum and organ.<br />The album is lush yet strangely alien, creating an image of the person caught in the whirlpool of modern society and being dragged slowly towards the center but yelling warning to the rest of us. All we can do is listen and watch carefully ourselves.
6302439566|5.0|Screw Siskel &amp; Ebert and their thumbs(down). This movie is PERFECT because it has my two of my favorite people,star John Travolta and supporter Laraine Newman. Newman,Jamie Lee Curtis and Marilu Henner are three beautiful women who show their PERFECT bodies in this film. However,many say that this film is the worst of Travolta's career. Carly Simon didn't have to throw her bloody Mary in Travolta's face. This film is a must for Rolling Stone subscribers,health club members and of course,John Travolta fans.
B00004XONN|3.0|A definite progression (they make some nice/interesting music without guitars) for the band, but that doesn't deride the fact that the SONGS for the most part, aren't quite up to snuff.<br />There is NO denying that this is a bit of a let down following Bends and OK Computer.<br />Still good though.
B00004X01U|3.0|To say that i was disappointed upon first listening to this album would be an understatement.  Impressive Instant was boring and non-involving, and the slow songs were agony to get through.  Madonna!!!!  Give us good lyrics, for the love of God!!!!  or for the love of Vishnu, I guess.<br />Upon listening to it every morning (while showering :)), I found little hooks in most every song.  Impressive instant became a good song to listen to when she would sing the lyrics, &quot;...singie singie singie...like a bird on a wingie wingie wingie...&quot;  And I grew to LOVE Don't Tell Me (best song) and Runaway Lover.  I don't know why, but the album started sounding better and better.<br />Now, don't get me wrong....songs like Gone and Amazing (blah!!!) should be laid to rest.  And my goodness...for someone who seems to be inventive, she surely could have done better than imitate Cher with her voice-transmoglifier (I just made that word up).<br />If you like Madonna, you will eventually grow to &quot;appreciate&quot; this album.  Her best one...in my humble opinion...will always be Erotica, though.
B00004UEDQ|1.0|First off I'd like to say that I'm a very big fan of Sandra Bullock.  Her quirky nature and cute antics usually brings life into a movie.  HOWEVER, 28 Days was absolutely terrible.  It's a shame that Sandra couldn't turn this movie around, but it's not her fault.  The plot is lacking, and full of holes, and the characters in the film have absolutely no depth.  The movie had very few comical scenes, and the dramatic sequences were drawn out.  This movie is very predictable, a 5 year old can figure this out.  If you don't believe me, go rent the movie, and when you try to figure out why you wasted 2 hours of your life on this lackadaisical film, you can e-mail me and tell me that I was right.  1 star for this movie, and if there was no Sandra Bullock, this movie wouldn't even get 1/2 a star.
6301562941|5.0|I saw this movie just a coulple of weeks ago and really liked it. This weekend I'm buying both the origanal and the specil edition! RENT IT!
B00004XQP4|5.0|All of Green Day's albums are just awesome.  I really loved this one and I think everyone should buy this CD. I can not stop listening to track 6 though. Misery is their best song ever because it holds an excellent tune plus has a good story line. Other then that I think all the songs are great as well and thats why I give it 5 stars.
6305903182|2.0|That should have been the title.  The only thing that kept me watching to the end was waiting for Jay and Silent Bob to come back to kick evil's...you know.  &quot;Hey look Silent Bob, it's Connie Chung (Gail Weathers)!&quot;  They are the only reason that I even gave this movie any stars at all ( 1 1/2 for their appearance, plus 1/2 for assuring us that this series ends with this one ).<br />Rent it to see Jay and Silent Bob.  The only reason I would buy it would be to add their cameo to my View Askew collection.

B00004XONN|4.0|As I poped in the CD and played the first song,  I was like whoe...this is ahead of the times!  Much like the way OK computer was like.  All the songs have a mellow futuristic feel.  It's almost hard to describe this music, I want to say mellow, but it almost keeps you up beat.  I guarantee you'll like this CD, I love it and I'm not a big Radiohead fanantic.

0811826848|5.0|The sheer size of this book is amazing. It's gonna take me years of Bathroom reading to get through this one. But what I have read so far is great because the beatles themselves wrote it so you know it's true! Anybody, even if they don't like the beatles's music should enjoy this book, simply for the fact that it shows how much four lives changed and developed over just ten years. Alot of great insight into the music industry of the sixties too!
B00004XONN|5.0|OK Computer created such a buzz when it first came out that I thought Radiohead's next album would be a letdown simply by default, but I was wrong.  This album is so hard to appreciate, but if you open your ears and your arms to it, the experience is close to spiritual.  This album sounds nothing OK Computer or The Bends, proving that Radiohead are one of the view original and innovative bands out there these crazy days.  Give it a listen, I say.
0684853523|5.0|Many authors have tried to explain how their life stories are connected to their works, but Stephen King's take on this question is far more successful than any other effort I have seen. The connections he draws between his own experiences and his writing actually make sense, as they are not buried in layers of psychological or literary theory: certain characters are drawn from life, and he tells us which incidents in his life inspired his plots.<br />The self-conscious &quot;writing tutorial&quot; elements of the book are a little drier, if only because King's engaging personality is a little more distant. But they would be impressive, standing on their own: they pale only when placed next to the memoir.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm not going to tell anyone to buy this album. If you wanted it, you'd have already bought it by now and listened to it. This is a note to you people. Am i the only one who, after just listening to the full album, realizes it's a classic? The sounds off this album give me a great feeling. Lying outside watching the wind blow the leaves down to the ground like rain, i listened to Kid A and couldn't help drifting into a strange, hypnotic feeling. Maybe this sounds like bull and is &quot;overdramatizing&quot; it, but it's how it makes me feel.  For those of you who don't understand how these are beautiful songs or are wondering what happened to all the melody...well i guess you bought the wrong CD.
B00004XONN|4.0|As someone who declared in 1994 that Radiohead would be the U2 of the 1990s, I've always been amazed by the talent of this British group. They're very literate, write songs that are full of intricacies, and are well-written. Each album seems to be better than the last. But then comes this album.  Everything you've read about it's experimental sound is certainly true.  The problem is, it is not often a very melodic album. So if you're in the mood to hear what Thom Yorke and Co. are doing to explore the possibilities of music, you will enjoy this album. If you're looking for anything you'll start humming along to, you're not going to find it here.  This album will probably become a classic, though, like many of Sinatra's &quot;dark&quot; albums of the 1950s, you've really got to be in the mood to enjoy it to its fullest potential.
B00004XONN|5.0|Way, way better than OK Computer.  Kid A has a unique sound that no one can ever mimic.  Radiohead is truly one of the last original bands out there.
B00004XQP4|1.0|will the last Green Day fan please turn off the light on your way out.  thank you.
B000002UAU|5.0|I enjoy the production quality on this CD.  This is a crowning achievement for George Martin, especially, considering he was working with only four-track tape machines and four of the most arrogant pop singers around.  When I compare this album with other albums from 1967, I am even more astounded. The popular music from the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; includes the DOORS and JEFFERSON AIRPLANE's SURREALISTIC PILLOW, neither of which hold a candle to what Martin accomplished.  The deservedly, legendary Jimi Hendrix introduced himself with ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? -- a truly historic album, groundbreaking in what he did with an electric guitar, however, the production of PEPPER is still superior. Even more impressive, George Martin writes in the notes that the &quot;recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band spanned 129 days, perhaps, the most creative 129 days in the history of rock music.&quot;  I would agree whole-heartedly.  The first segue way is seamless.  &quot;SPLHCB&quot;, clapping, cheering, organ drone, &quot;Billie Shears&quot;, electric guitar w/ clapping, Ringo.  A very interesting 10 seconds.  GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING is another masterpiece. At 2'00&quot; the rooster crows, again, a bird twitters from far right to centre, a backward cat sounds becomes right way round, a dog barks, horse whinneys... and we are out on the street as a carriage passes.  A DAY IN THE LIFE also contains a beautiful segue way at 2'00&quot; when the song shifts from John to Paul.  Amazing.  In less than 4 months and 2 weeks, George Martin created a production masterpiece which elevated the existing standard to an entirely new level. As Mick Jagger once said, &quot;Sgt. Pepper was an 'album', SATANIC MAJESTY's was just a bunch of songs.&quot;  It was Pepper which made the distinction between albums and collections.  The popular world was now a different place.   Martin completes the album with a bit of whimsey, &quot;then, as the coup de grace, there is a few seconds of nonsense Beatle chatter, taped, cut into several pieces and stuck back together at random so that, as George Martin says, purchasers of the vinyl album who did not have an auto return on their record player would say 'What the hell's that?' and find the curious noise going on and on ad infinitum in the concentric run-out groove.  Bravo!  If you are interested in the &quot;most important revealing compact disc release there can ever be&quot; according to the notes, or in a landmark production, this CD will be interesting to you.
B00004X01U|2.0|I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPEND. I REALLY HATE TO COMPARE THIS ALBUM TO RAY OF LIGHT BUT IT IS REALLY HARD NOT TO.  ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT MADONNAS FOLLOW-UP TO THAT MASTERPIECE WOULD BE SUCH A SHALLOW, EMPY, AND EMOTIONLESS ALBUM.  I'M REALLY DOUBT THAT MADONNA HAD MUCH INPUT INTO THE PRODUCTION AND WRITING OF THIS ALBUM. IT DOSENT SEEM PERSONAL AT ALL.  I'M SUPRISED THAT SHE HAS LET HER ART SLIP LIKE THIS.  ITS REALLY A SLAP IN THE FACE OF HER REAL FANS.  I REALLY EXPECTED MORE. I THINK THAT THE ALBUM WILL SELL WELL, BUT HONESTLY I DONT THINK THAT ITS VERY GOOD. I'VE GIVEN 2 STARS ONLY BECAUSE ITS A MADONNA ALBUM AND I LOVE HER PREVIOUS WORK. IF THIS ALBUM WAS FROM ANY OTHER ARTIST IT WOULD GET 1 STAR. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.
B000000W5P|4.0|I enjoy the songs on this CD.  I consider this one of the more respectable offerings from the Rolling Stones.  It reminds me of the songs from the BEGGAR's BANQUET to EXILES ON MAIN STREET era, a time when Mick and Keith lived up to their reputations as the &quot;world's greatest rock and roll band.&quot;  Mick Jaggar even succeeds in developing some controversy with the title cut.  Yes, the lyric is misogynic.  Even so, it isn't anything that would make Lil' Kim blush.  I would much rather be kept up all night by Mick Jagger than be cut &quot;half in two&quot; by the 32-20 of Robert Johnson. This is just to say that if sexist lyrics offend, this CD is not for you.  I appreciate the variety of styles: country (FAR AWAY EYES); soul (JUST MY IMAGINATION); soft rock (MISS YOU, BEAST OF BURDEN); rap (SHATTERED), with the remainder falling into the hard rock category.  I enjoy this line from RESPECTABLE, &quot;We don't worry about the things we used to do&quot;, and at the begining of BEFORE THEY MAKE ME RUN, Keith Richard quotes from ALL DOWN THE LINE and then HONKY TONK WOMAN.  If you are interested in the Rolling Stones of the late sixties and early seventies, or in good rock 'n roll, this CD will be interesting to you.
6304078102|1.0|Vicious stereotyping by a film that didn't seem to think it was yanking the heartstrings enough, they had to make his kid deaf as well. What a sick, pathetic oscar ploy from a washed up actor way past his prime.  If you like schlock, or are into gimmicky, syrup-ridden tripe, then you will love Mr. Holland's Opus.
B000000XB9|5.0|If only all greatest-hits CDs were as complete and thoroughly satisfying as &quot;Chronicle.&quot;  This disc captures nearly all of Creedence's hits, and is a must for any fan.  &quot;Chronicle II&quot; has its share of gems as well, but if you want a quick crash course in CCR, it just doesn't get any better than this.<br />They're all here: &quot;Bad Moon Rising,&quot; &quot;Lodi,&quot; &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain,&quot; &quot;Down on the Corner,&quot; &quot;Looking Out My Back Door,&quot; the list is endless.  Such a generous offering almost seems criminal.  You simply can't ask for more.
020530902X|5.0|... of this book, which cost 95 cents.  The video generation will appreciate how short the book is, and New Agers will groove on its Zen-ish conciseness.  Over the years, I've noticed that the more Strunkandwhitian principles a piece of writing violates, the more irritating it is.  Some of their examples may sound outmoded, but their simple rules will still work wonders with what J.R.R. Tolkien called &quot;today's slack and frivolous idiom.&quot;
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's albums have all continued along a trend of leaving the norm for a rock album.  Slowly they have become one of the most unique bands out there, and Kid A is one of the mose unique albums to date.  Most people hearing this album will hate it, it really doesnt have any melodies and the words are hard to hear so you can never really sing along.  But what radiohead does in this album that makes it great is to create a mood that appeals to the soul.  I for one think that with a little more refining radiohead could change the sound of modern rock into something similar to Kid A.  To listen to this album is to hear the future, it is incredible.
B00004XONN|5.0|The question that everybody was afraid to ask was, &quot;how can radiohead possible follow 'Ok computer'?&quot;  Radiohead refuses to answer the question and instead releases &quot;Kid A.&quot;  This album in no way tries to top &quot;ok computer.&quot;  It instead is a masterpiece in it's own right that should not, and cannot, be compared with the previous album.        'Kid A' is a very moody, ambient and etherial work that is best listened to as a whole.  The album is fill with keyboards and electronics of all sorts and what is noticably sparce are guitars and rock drums.  Radiohead bring a new hope to music by successfully creating music outside of the typical rock and roll formula.      This album may upset a lot of people.  As with each album, their sound has evolved considerable.  The incredible production is still there, but this album has an overall different kind of feeling of misery and despair.  This album is still too new in my brain to go into any deeper thoughts on it.  The only thought I have currently is what can radiohead possible do next?
B00003CXB4|5.0|Ok, so I haven't seen the DVD, as it hasn't been released, but are Disney mad?  The Lion King was one of, if not, the most popular Disney animation of all time.  If Disney are willing to release TLK: 2 on DVD why not release the first, and in my opinion much better, rendition.  I loved this film when it was released 5 years ago, and I always wanted it.  As its not available in the UK anymore, I and I'm sure many others, would welcome a DVD release.
B00004XONN|4.0|With this album Radiohead continue to reinvent themselves yet again, proving that they are the most innovative, intelligent and talented band on the planet. While at times wishing for more of the aching beauty of &quot;OK, Computer&quot;, overall this record does not disappoint. &quot;Kid A&quot; may be accessible only for the open minded, but if you had a closed mind you wouldn't be on this page would you?
B00004XONN|4.0|Given that Radiohead had the unenviable task of matching the expectations of their last magnum opus, OK Computer, they've done a fine job of creating an album that stands up in its own right with Kid A.  This is not The Return of the Bends or OK Computer II, it's something decidedly different and is unlikely to be as popular as their previous albums.  If you were intrigued by some of the sounds that they were developing on their last album then you should be in for some aural treats on Kid A, if however you only think of Radiohead as their big stadium rock operas like Creep or Paranoid Android, than be prepared to be let down (and hanging around?)<br />Kid A is at times unsettling, abrasive and disquieting.  Many of the songs have a sublime beauty that really creeps up on you, this is certainly an album that warrants many listenings, don't be too hasty to dismiss them as 'going all weird on us', at the end of the day this is still a rock album, its just rock is going through a bit of an identity crisis at the moment.  One gets the feeling that with this album, Radiohead are still refining their sound, the album is not a definitive statement, it's quite open ended and seems to point to things ahead.  Let's hope that we don't have to wait too long for the sequel.
0553106635|5.0|Martin's third instalment in the \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series runs to about 924 pages, which makes it some 200 pages longer than its predecessor, \\"A Clash of Kings\\".<br />But never once does the pace let up: \\"Swords\\" is every bit as ferocious and grim as the earlier volumes. In fact, at one especially nasty and unexpected turn, I had to stop reading for a minute just to catch my breath (something that hadn't happened whilst reading either of the two earlier books).<br />I'll not say all too much about the story (or rather stories, as again each chapter focuses on a different main character). But I could mention that, at the end of \\"Swords\\", almost half of the main contenders for the Iron Throne are dead. That ought to give you some idea.<br />Also, Jaime Lannister has become a major character, and the way in which he is portrayed may surprise you. And more scenes take place at and North of The Wall, which means more of Jon Snow and - hurrah! - the charmingly cowardly Samwell Tarly (better known as Ser Piggy).<br />All in all, \\"Swords\\" is at least as good as the earlier two volumes, and as a result, \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" has become the very best fantasy series now in progress. I would recommend it very highly to just about everyone (that is, everyone who doesn't mind explicit violence and brief but sometimes coarse renditions of sex). <br />Having said this, there is still one element ostensibly missing, both in this book and in the series as a whole: a central narrative drive, or plot, if you will. As yet, Martin has given us what is basically one long progression of wars, shifting alliances, betrayals, and the like. Those that have pointed out that the series will therefore ultimately become, if not boring, at least unsatisfactory, may still prove to be right. I doubt it, though: the mysterious Others are conspicuous in this book and, by now, not just The Night Watch is taking notice. And besides, the series is probably not called \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" fornothing (instead of, for example, \\"A Myriad of Murders\\").
B00001NFCY|5.0|I bought &quot;Human Clay&quot; because of &quot;Higher&quot;, realizing that it was a great song, and also knowing that the band was going somewhere. But what I didn't expect is that this CD is as good as it is. There are several great songs, including &quot;Are you Ready&quot;, &quot;What if&quot;, and &quot;Never Die&quot;. The rest of the album is pretty good too, making this album stand out above many others. (I was also surprised to see that it's ranked #6 on the Billboard Top 50 after so long. That proves that it's good.) And coming from a Metallica fan, this is a compliment. Is this CD as good as Metallica's greatest album, &quot;The Black Album&quot;? I can't say, but the fact that they are so close in comparison should already persuade you to buy it.<br />There are plenty of good rock songs, good enough that make you say, &quot;Whoa, this is great!&quot; I mean, how many CD's are there that actually impress you fifteen seconds into the first track? I can't think of any, including Metallica. The lyrics are, at times, hard to understand with the guitars and the drums slamming in the background, but this just adds to it, making your adrenaline rise very quickly, almost instantly.<br />I've seen reviews from people saying, &quot;This CD is just the work of a Christian Rock Band, and is overall, very poor.&quot; Hey, if Christian rock is like this, I should be listening to it more often! And honestly, I could care less if they're a religious band. If they can sing good, and got rockin' songs, and can still sing about good things in life, other than killing people and doing drugs like other bands I won't mention, then let them do it. I mean, who wants to listen to depressing music like that? If you do, that's your own business, but don't decide not to purchase this album just because of good lyrics. It's a good CD with plenty of good songs, and if you decide not to purchase it just because their lyrcis are decent, then you got some problems.<br />So if you've considered buying this CD, do it now, because the longer you don't have it, the longer you'll go without good, quality music. &quot;But you don't have to take my word for it,&quot; That annoying guy from Reading Rainbow. (Don't ask me why I thought of that: Actually, my friend told me to write that. Last time I trust him!)<br />Hope this review was helpful.............
0812589041|4.0|Mark Twain said of classics that they are books that people praise but do not read. Ender's Game is different because people read it in their droves.<br />This is a wonderful book for readers who are young in years or young in heart, and appeals in the same way as the White Mountains Trilogy or Harry Potter appeals. The issues surrounding bullying and life in a highly competitive school environment are relevant to all school age kids. The way the kids are manipulated by adults right to the end also strikes a chord.<br />But to be a classic a book has to appeal to the adult reader. Despite some thorny issues surrounding the use of children to fight war, this is undoubtedly a book with a wide base of appeal amongst adult readers.  The success of Ender's game is reflected in the number of sequels that have appeared.<br />This is a great book, and a really enjoyable and well told story. What I do believe is that we will see many characters like Demosthenes and Locke blossom on the internet discussion groups, as the net becomes a more coherent medium.  To a certain extent Enders Game might represent a view of our own future!
B00004X01U|4.0|Even though Music is a little reminiscent of Ray of Light (of which I'm not the biggest fan), I'm very pleased with Music. The Mirwais-produced songs such as the title track and Impressive Instant are clearly the highlights, with bouncy dancefloor-ready beats. The French producer filters Madonna's voice through everything but a Cuisinart. The William Orbit-produced tracks sound like Ray of Light leftovers. Though not on par with Like a Prayer or Erotica, Music is a fine effort from a living legend.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The best of the cd is absolutly &quot;pARANOID ANDROID&quot; &quot;KARMA POLICE&quot; and &quot;NO SURPRISES&quot; and the rest is SO cool too!!!! GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B00004U8H4|1.0|American Phsyco was totally horrible.  A bunch of people tell me that it is just great, so I go and rent it and bore my self to death for two hours. The plot is okay, but the movie just goes nowhere and gets very boring. I would not reccomend this movie to anyone.
B00004X01U|4.0|I don't know why some ppl don't like this album. It's so COOL!  Here's my track run-down.<br />Music-Great song, great video (I loved Ali G in it-Boyakasha! )<br />Impressive Instant-I love it!  If only for the way the line 'I like to singy singy singy, like a bird on the wingy wingy wingy' actually sounds really, really good!  Great to dance to!<br />Runaway Lover-A good track, although I find myself skipping it...<br />I Deserve It-I love it!  Written about Guy Ritchie?  Sounds like it!  This is a real Get-Together-Around-A-Campfire-With-Your-Guitar-Song. If you are feeling a bit emotional, this song will probably make you cry! <br />Amazing-It's a grrrrrrrrrrrrreat song!  The start is really good!  It has this amazing (no pun intended) retro feel, without being too much like Beautiful Stranger (which I absolutely ADORE, full stop) <br />Nobody's Perfect-I feel that, despite what everyone says, the vocoder suits this song perfectly (no pun intended). Cher uses the vocoder in a cheesy way, with cheesy producing, so her songs sound CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEESY!  But Madonna is just class, so her songs just sound like, completely classy!<br />Don't Tell Me-This song is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllllll!  It's got such a catchy chorus, and it reminds me of me!  I hate being told to learn anything!  I love the guitar in the background!  This just makes country completely cool! <br />What It Feels Like For A Girl-God. The best song on the album. Indescribable. It's like, the perfect song.The lyrics just make so much sense, it's changed my opinion on the two genders(!).It's just, like trancey, because it's so soothing. Oh, and even the speakey bit is completely brilliant, and speakey bits usually make me ill! <br />Paradise(Not For Me)- Uuuuugggghhh. A whole speakey song. Completely, mind-blowingly nauseating. And when she sings French!  For God's sake, spare me!  The only good bits are when she actually sings.<br />Gone-Great song, about inner strength. A really hippy/folky hands-in-the-air number.<br />American Pie-Good song, but ruined by the fact that I now know that Rupert Everett was doing backing vocals!  Now I get distracted by that!<br />Well done Madonna!  You have found a new fan in me!
B00004YC2F|4.0|Let me be clear about this.  Even though this is a concerto and Volodos plays very well, the BPO is just super.  First to the playing.  I thought Volodos played very well and seems to be the real deal, although his lack of soft play (piano and pianissimo was not always there--maybe the recording...more to that in a moment) was disapointing.  There are tons of piano markings in the score and he does not always follow them.<br />The BPO is beyond first rate, they play to their standard which is higher than any other orchestra in the world, and Levine has great touch and phrasing in his conducting.  When you have any orchestra this good you want to hear them.<br />This does not always happen however, and I blame this on the recording and the Sony team.  The piano is just microphoned to closely. It does not sound natural, I know that is not the balance that would be heard in a concert hall and I doubt the balance you hear on this cd between the Berlin Philharmonic and Volodos is what the listeners heard in Berlin.  I do not understand why at times record companies over mic soloists.  It is not needed, I want to hear a natural sound picture and this is not the case.  A pity when the orchestra sounds so good and many of the small details and naunces could have been made audible (and they are not) without lose to the solo piano.  The recording is a big disappointment.  Sony and James Levine should know and can do better than this.<br />5 Stars for the Berlin Philharmonic.  4 Stars for Volodos and Levine (Levine gets 4 starts for leting this false balance between Piano and Orchestra pass).  2 Stars to Sony recording team for gross errors in balance between the piano and orchestra. 4 stars overall.  I recommend this concerto, but have strong problems with the recording balance.  Record companies can and should do better....I want to hear the entire score, not just the solo piano part or soloist.
B000000OY9|1.0|Boy this is a bad album.  It's really not even worth listening to after you've heard it once.  There are a couple of good melodies in a couple of the songs, but nothing on here is completely a good song.  My guess is that Mr. Young really wanted this album NOT to sell, so Geffen wouldn't make a lot of money off of it.
B00004XONN|5.0|I've read many a review on this record and it's apparent that you will either love it or hate it, there's no middle ground(that I can gather from the previous reviews anyways). This is certainly a record that cannot be ignored. It's not spoon-fed pop, it's much scarier....much more beautiful. It is honest. This record doesn't lie to you, it's a record Radiohead made for fans of music, not the top twenty countdowns and hit parades. People looking for 'Creep part II' need not apply. No two songs sound anything alike. From the disjointed electronic beats and enthralling, pleading words that drip from Thom Yorkes mouth on 'Idioteque' to the somber intermission of 'Treefingers'. From the driving bass line and cacaphony of acid jazz horns in 'The National Anthem', to the sparse, lush, haunting 'How to Disappear Completely'. It's arranged like a motion picture, telling the story of 'Kid A', complete with aforementioned intermission. I'll be ruffling some feathers here, but in regards to the progression of Radiohead as a band, this would have to be their 'Sgt. Pepper' where OK Computer was their 'Revolver'(Sorry to all the OK fans!!). Guitars in some parts sound eerily like whales mating(or babies crying, if you will), and on 'Everything in it's Right Place', some of Thoms vocal samples are even recorded backwards(frightening!!). It's sheer post-modern chaos. Certainly the most creative record in the last 30+ years, but don't take my word for it. Buy the record and listen to it. REALLY listen to it. And then listen to it again. And again. And again after that. I thought this was a mess when I listened to it the first time, but somewhere along in the third spin everything fell into place and I got it. 'Kid A' grows on you. I appreciate the utter brilliance conveyed on it now. It invokes thought and taps into emotions you never knew you had. Well, that's my two cents. I see the future of rock(or whatever you want to call it) with an 'Optimistic' eye now thanks to the juggernaut of Radiohead.ut of Radiohead.
B0000046W9|5.0|This is a 4 CD Box set of Stan Getz Samba Jazz.  It has an amazing live version of the Girl from Ipanema.  However, there are too many songs to list all the great ones.  I honestly have listened to all 4 CD's back to back a number of times.  If you love Stan Getz or Samba this is a must have, and will bring you endless enjoyment.  If you are looking for a start to the Jazz Bossa Nova movement Stan Getz, and this set is a great place to start.  Desafindo was (and is) a very popular song, and even hit the pop charts in it's original release.  This is my favorite Stan Getz period.
B00000JGEN|2.0|Arnold has made a lot of 3 or 4 star outa 5 star movies in my opinion &amp; he had to make this one.  What for?  This one has no good story and just isnt a very good sci fi film.  The action was fairly poor I thought!   Once the game starts,everything is way downhill from there.  Normally in arnold movies, the plot isnt the best, but it still entertains you, which this one seizes to do.  It seizes to entertain you.
B000002GXX|5.0|Not quite on the level of Hotel California but what is? Not a single week song on this one. The song writing is great, and the hard driving guitar playing of Don Felder helps make this one classic. A little of everything here. The R and B flavored title track, the countryish Lyin Eyes and Hollywood Waltz, and great ballads with Take It To The Limit, Journey of The Sorcerer, and I Wish You Peace. There's the bluesy After The Thrill is Gone and the pure, unadulterated rock and roll of Too Many Hands. All in all, this album is a lot of fun to listen to.
6300248178|4.0|Yea this is one of arnolds good 1s!  Not his best but good &amp; it stays interesting unlike some of his films.  My favorite 1 of his is still True Lies, but this is one of his good ones!  I can see why a lota people enjoy it.
0140282033|5.0|I was seduced by Harris and her tasty novel.  Like the real thing it was an indulgance that the reader could savor.  I fell in love with this novel and it's incredible writer immediately.  You should see my copy-it's falling apart from reading it a couple of times and loaning it out to anyone I could find.  Definitely a story to share with others.  This book has a rainbow of characters whom capture your heart.  Harris's main character Vianne with her sweet young Anouk, weaves a colorful web of strangers that she gives you feelings of empathy for.  There is the eccentric Armande, gentle Guiallme, the surly Roux, and the timid yet defiant Josephine.  Even Reynaud, the pensive and obsessive priest made me laugh out loud now and then.<br />I especially appreciated the author's sensitivity toward other religions, as a wiccan it is a relief to not be bombarded with whimsy fantasy that witches are often associated with.  Read Harris's dedication and you will see why.  Harris use of herbalism, tarot, scrying,and magic is honest and sticks to tradition.<br />Read this book! But buyer beware: a movie is in the works and it's coming soon.  Don't forget the many wonderful books that have been picked apart at the hands of Hollywood-I've read the premises.  It's like Hersheys trying to making belgian chocolate.  Read this book before it's too late!;-)
B00003CXE7|4.0|For a complex film, &quot;Gladiator&quot; can still be taken for a simple heroic story. Russell Crowe manages to dominate the screen so well that I spent much of my first viewing anticipating his next appearance in the script. It is the sort of film that needs to be seen at least twice  to understand most of the sub-plots. To an extent, this is a flaw on the part of director Ridley Scott. It should have been possible to focus the narrative a little more clearly than he did.<br /><br />The main theme of the film concerns General Maximus Decimus Meridius. The opening scenes show him as a competent, charismatic military leader during a battle where his legions brutally decimate the Germanic hordes. As fine a General as he may be, he is a deliberately poor politician. And so it is no surprise when the prodigal political creature, Cesar's son Commodus, played well be Joaquin Phoenix, takes the throne with the aid of a little poison and immediately sets about to secure his position. Maximus is quietly sent away, to be executed, and orders for his wife and children are on their way before he is out of sight.<br /><br />Not only is Maximus a proficient General but he is also skilled at personal combat. These talents help him to escape his immediate fate but not without some serious wounds. Wounds that slow him enough to prevent any  rescue of his family. And so, we have a classic revenge scenario. The newly crowned Cesar, Commodus, is cast as the villain and Maximus is the hero, bent on revenge. This sort of plot can become laughably predictable but thanks to a decent script and Crowe's outstanding performance, we are forced into the cauldron of hate along with Maximus.<br /><br />His revenge takes a less direct route than Maximus would have liked, since he is quickly scooped up by slave traders and, due to his imposing physique, snapped up by Proximo, a provincial games promoter. Killing for sport suites Maximus well, even if he would prefer a different face on his opponent. It is not long before Proximo realises that he may have something special. Despite the tempering influence of other fighters, specifically the Numidian Juba, (played with subtle appeal by Djimon Hounsou), Maximus is too efficient. He kills without any lingering flourishes, spoiling the crowd's fun.<br /><br />All this changes when Proximo gives Maximus a glimpse of hope. The new  Emperor is reopening the games in Rome and needs Gladiators. Proximo tries to tempt Maximus with the freedom of the wooden sword, a symbol of the freedom awarded for truly spectacular performances in the arena. But freedom is not what fires the General's imagination. It is the fact that the Emperor himself presents the award in person, a clear avenue to consummation of his vengeful goals.<br /><br />Once again the simple linear approach is not taken. Events turn murky as Maximus becomes, at first, a crowd pleaser and then a political power as he successfully and repeatedly defeats the Emperor's chosen on the hot sands of Rome. As his fame spreads, he draws the powerful to him; the Emperor's sister, (and Maximus' former lover), Lucilla, various Senators, and even the Emperor's heir. But in the end it comes down to two, Maximus and Commodus.<br /><br />A lot of people have praised the special effects and cinematography of Gladiator. Personally, I was less than impressed with many of the scenes, as they seemed muddled and confused. Even the computer-generated work forgot the first rule, reality is imperfect. Everything seemed too newly minted; flawless in its grandeur and therefore slightly suspect. However, the action in the coliseum was breathtaking and some of the solo fights were particularly effective cinema. But at bottom, Gladiator is not a special effects movie. It rests squarely on Crowe's shoulders and he successfully carries it beyond the realms of mediocrity, raising it up to become a modern classic.not long before Proximo realises that he may have something special.

B00000DFSK|5.0|I'd love to tell you something about my experience with those recordings, from the view of a normal person, which used not to be interested in U2, or even rock music.<br />I bought their greatest hits 6 months ago, and it was just because of track n.3 - &quot;With or without you&quot; - which I heared on the radio. After listening to the whole album, I realized that I paid for a kind of music I will probably never like, and wanted to go to the shop and return it back. But after another listening, I found out that I like some songs.  After a few days, I totally changed my mind. This is not the type of music you hear once on a radio, you like it, buy it, listen to it for 20 times and then throw it away, forever. The tracks which seem dumb and uninteresting suddenly start to grow into amazing and wonderful sort of rock you never forget to sing everywhere you go. The longer my antipaties to a song lasted, the better I found it in the end.  After two weeks, I started to love this album, the band and also rock music. I was totally drown in it. I couldn't have resisted playing it again and again. U2 became my favourite band, and now I own another four albums.<br />I hope now you all get what I wanna say. After buying this, even for only one track, (I really wasn't U2 fan that time so I cannot blame them for not-100-percent-perfect choosing of tracks) I will never regret.  U2 is a legend. U2 is a band with lots of ideas, marvellous sounds and unforgettable music, which leaves you pinned to the floor with unexplainably wonderful feelings.<br />I hope that if you hesitated before buyng this CD, now you don't. Because this is the best thing you can get for your money.
B00003CX8J|5.0|In any group there can be found extremists and throughout history the most common type is the &quot;kill the strangers&quot; brand of fanatic. In the X-Men, we are introduced to a new group of humanity, mutants. These people are born with gifts and curses that set them apart from their neighbours. It is no surprise to learn that the rest of humanity is rumbling  and in the best tradition of politics, one Senator stands up to be counted. Senator Robert Jefferson Kelly has made it his mission to track and control the dangerous and secretive mutants. If you replace the word &quot;mutants&quot; in his speeches with &quot;Jews&quot;, you would get a clear Nazi feel for it all.<br /><br />The scriptwriters clearly borrowed a lot from Nazi Germany, not the least of which was the opening scene. A crowd of Jews is being herded into a concentration camp, complete with ominous smokestacks in the background. In the crowd, a young boy is separated from his parents as the gates close, the quota being filled. The boy is distraught and struggles to reach his parents. What is surprising is how successful he is, dragging two soldiers along the muddy road. Then we realise that the wire fence is bending towards him, being twisted as if by a giant hand. This miracle abruptly ends as yet another soldier slams the but of his rifle into the boy's face.<br /><br />Powerful images abound in the film. But at no stage is it heavy handed. This is one of those great stories where things are not always clear. We feel sympathy for the most violent and aggressive character in the film, Magneto. He may want to kill or transform the greater bulk of homo-sapiens but all the  time, we know he is that little boy who survived the holocaust. Even the bigoted and opportunistic Senator gets our sympathy when he is imprisoned and subjected to experimentation by Magneto. What's even scarier is that some of the good Senator's speeches actually made some sense. &quot;These mutant children have powers more dangerous than hand guns. We don't allow guns in schools, do we?&quot;<br /><br />Not all mutants want to dominate humanity. There is a group in Westchester being led by a wheelchair bound Professor named Charles Xavier. A mind reading mutant himself, he runs a school for the gifted that also doubles as a base for the X-Men. What do his students do when they graduate? Why, they use their talents for good, fighting crime and injustice. Luckily they have avoided the spandex accessories in their super hero careers, opting instead for form hugging black leather. Where do I sign up?<br /><br />The film has a large cast of important characters. Given the scope of the comic series, on which it is based, that is unavoidable. As the franchise develops, this will only become more of an issue. However, the story focuses mainly on one mutant, Wolverine, and we are encouraged to see most things  through his eyes. Otherwise known as Logan, he is a great character and his main gift seems to be a long-burning anger at the world. If you're angry all the time, it comes in handy to have six spring-loaded blades that can sprout from between your knuckles. Just the potential for damage forces us to carefully watch his every move. I was quite pleased when Hugh Jackman got this role. He's a talented Aussie actor and for those that aren't aware, he has a good singing voice as well.<br /><br />There's little point is describing all the characters in the film, although I would like to single out Anna Paquin for special praise. There are many powerful roles and they are all interesting. All except Dr Jean Grey, Famke Janssen, who doesn't do a whole lot of important things during the film. Since, in the comics, the good doctor developed into, Pheonix, one of the most powerful mutants, I look forward to seeing her spread her wings in the future. In fact, there is so much that needs exploring, after watching this enthralling film, that I hope they make another ten.rous than hand guns.

B00004YA66|5.0|An interesting thriller, with its basis of &quot;time travel&quot; in current String theory.  I saw this movie several times and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The audience applauded at the end of  each showing.  A nice feel good movie.
B00001ZUGJ|1.0|Nice try. I liked this film better the first time when it was called TRON. Stupid philosophical schmaltz passed off as the real thing. Is the idea of illusionary reality a new thing? For fans of the Matrix it may be. Go read some books and find out how watered down this movie really is. I hated it all the more due to its tedious marketing and hub-bub. Tron had Jeff Bridges, the Matrix has dumb-face. Tron had GOOD computer special effects that were unlike anything seen before. Matrix has off the shelf effects that we've seen before in about a thousand video games. Is this a film or a video game intro? A bunch of worhtless garbage. Go buy it and tell your friends how great it looks and sounds on your Sony.
B00004XONN|1.0|Can we all agree not to use 'Everything in it's Right Place' or 'Kid' puns in the review titles anymore? It wasn't clever the first time, and 400+ reviews later it's getting intolerable!
B00004XONN|1.0|How do I hate thee &quot;Kid A&quot;? Let me count the ways...on a calculator!
0671004107|5.0|I am currently reading this book for the fifth time.  It is one of the greatest books I have ever read.  The characters are vivid, the ideas explored are profound.  It is a positive book; it gives one hope for the future of this little planet.  I would recommend it to absolutely everyone.
0811826848|5.0|Imagine (as John would say) if all the great artists of our time or any time had been able to tell their story themselves. Imagine if Callas had written about her first night at the Met. Or if Elvis put down into words how the Sun Sessions felt or the crackle of his first live performances. Or if Dusty Springfield had written about just how she was able to get that aching soulfulness into &quot;Son of a Preacher Man.&quot; Okay, some of our greatest artists have had the chance and blew it (Aretha, the most revealing singer of all time is the least revealing teller of her own story). Within these pages Paul, Ringo, George and a bit of Yoko give us a big picture window into the life of the greatest pop band of all time. This book is a wonder and a joy. And it made me miss the genius, humor and intellect that was and will ever be John Lennon all over again. Bravo, boys. You've done a splendid job.
0767817710|5.0|Very very good! Especially for a Western of the modern era. And because I am not a big fan of newer westerns. Sharon Stone played an excellent role for playing a strong female role. Gene Hackman was an excellent bad guy!!! The scenery was very accurate.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Yes!  I was nine years old when I first saw Forbidden Planet in 1956.  It was at the Oakhills drive-in (long since removed) here in Salt Lake City, Utah.  I still have memories of how frightening it was.  Nightmares abound for years after.  As I grew older, it appeared on television and always rekindled those same scary feelings inside me.  Now I have my own VHS copy and am buying the DVD version.  I watch it every year, usually around halloween.  It was way ahead of it's time and still is.  Nothing before or after, including Starwars and trek compares.  We all have our &quot;ids&quot; and monsters inside us to control.  This movie reminds us of that.
B00004XONN|4.0|When I bought this album, I had read reviews saying things like Kid A was an &quot;experimental&quot; album, and &quot;a new direction&quot; for Radiohead.  But Kid A is not some wayward experiment, Radiohead has taken deliberate steps to break down musical landscapes.  In Kid A, Radiohead does indeed take some daring strides in music, sometimes overreaching, but the result is still worthwhile.  Radiohead has shown (just like previous albums) their ability to evolve, and keep getting better.<br />On Kid A, Radiohead seems to completely abandon their sound for a diverse array of instruments, mumbled vocals, and eerie soundscapes.  But the album is still a compelling listen, and several tracks stand out on this album.  Tracks such as Everything in its right place (#1), Optimistic (#6) or my favorite In Limbo (#7)just seem to get stuck in your head.  The other tracks are also diverse, such as the pseudo-techno of Idioteque (#8), or The National Anthem (#3) replete with brass instrumentation.  <br />Kid A remains another compelling work in the Radiohead library.  It would be hard to top such a masterpiece as OK Computer, but then again, Radiohead isn't trying to do better.  The album is a deepening of their sound, and like their other albums, another evolution, another worthy selection in the library of a great band.
0811826848|5.0|10 stars to say the least!  First of all, I ordered this book through Amazon and received it VERY quickly - thanks Jeff Bezos!<br />Getting back to the Beatles Anthology, what a job they have done and thanks to George Martin and the late-great Derek Taylor.  This book is big and heavy because the Beatles were/are big and a heavy part of our culture.  The story is finally told the right way and not to put anyone down like the late Nick Schaffner, Lewisohn, Hunter Davis or others who have written great books.  If it weren't for them, we wouldn't know so much in the first place.  <br />But this book HAD to be happen.  John, Paul, George &amp; Ringo - thanks for everything!  One little thing missing - I wanted to know more on the modern day, Anthology video, CD and book get togetherness.  Who called who?  How was it decided?  And, yes, more from Yoko's modern day participation.  <br />Thanks for the Love and Music!  Can't wait for Beatles One CD!

B00004XONN|5.0|everything in it's right place burbles first and then lurches, an intense display of repetition that leads into slight lyrical hooks and then returns to the title mantra.  waves of sound effects arrive and depart, mostly vocal protool stuff on thom's voice.  the culture shock here i suppose being how the song breaks down rather than take off when it sounds like it's about to.<br />the title track is the biggest departure from their previous work.  thom recorded speaking the lyrics into a mic, and jonny playing them back as melodies, using probably some kind of software package.  title actually refers to computer programme of children's voices named kid a.  impressive stop start drumming, that kind of remains ever present by phil counting in the next beat by tapping his sticks together, really well done.  <br />complex string arrangement elevates how to disappear to new heights.  inventive vocal work by thom, singing different melodies over the same repetitive (that word again) chord progression.<br />national anthem melds punishing drumming (that kind of subtley speeds up towards the end) with a wild brass section and a doomy ever present bassline that doesn't change throughout.  the horns comprising of a jazz octet are conducted by jonny, manage to lift the  track out of potential dirge territory, in a similar way the strings do on the previous track.<br />treefingers is lovely...and mysterious, would be perfect for the opening credits of one of the alien films.  impossible to pin down, shifting chords are complimented by ambient effects. (possibly supplied by guitars, shock horror!)  the timing is kind of ever shifting which keeps things interesting till its conclusion.<br />optimistic is the only song that is structured like songs from previous albums.  a lovely swooping melody leads into the verse that contains primal lyrics (&quot;big fish eat the little ones&quot;) complimented by a furious tom tom assault.  excellent chorus, and when the swooping melody fromthe intro returns at the end, with raging guitars and phil's rapid drum fills, you can't fail to be uplifted.<br />in limbo returns to similar territory to previous tracks, with yorke trying different melodies over an unchanging chord progression.  completely guitar based this time though.<br />idioteque has beats and samples for the first time in their recording history, (the samples culled from two records i can honestly say i've never heard of).  lovely chorus, but the song kind of fails to go anywhere after the second one, and when yorke's vocals return at the close, they are kind of frustratingly muffled.  <br />there's definetly more to morning bell, a beautiful melody that recalls rabbit in your headlights, and some actual lead guitar work makes an appearance in parts.  interesting lyrics too - &quot;where'd you park the car&quot;, &quot;you can keep the furniture&quot;, &quot;cut the kids/keys in half&quot;.  along with some of the more memorable lyrics you can actually make out on the title track, this one features some great evocations from yorke, who i think is probably improving as a lyricist all the time, when you think of the embarassing angst ridden efforts on pablo honey.<br />motion picture soundtrack, an old track, throws harps in the mix.  which actually make the choir thrown in sound less heavy handed than on tracks like lucky and exit music, which is a considerable achievement.<br />as is the album. new territory is staked out all over the place, that for the most part works.  the ascension into heaven bit at the end is lovely too.  the only big band in the world worth bothering with really, it'll be very interesting to see where they go next.
0553374842|4.0|This book really showcases the beautiful artwork of Ralph McQuarrie, who helped establish the look of the Star Wars films way back at the dawn of the story as we know it.  In this book we see fascinating early visual drafts of things that we would later see in the movies.  Most of it was impossibly fantastic to ever get filmed at the time but maybe we'll see some of it in the next two movies.<br />The chapters on Alderan and Bespin are particular fascinating and beautiful.
B00004XONN|4.0|After hearing the clips on Amazon I didn't think I would like this album. I was convinced Radiohead was trying to accomplish the same feats as an Andy Warhol movie. That being to completely annoy the audience and challenge their conception of what deserves to be seen/listened to. I hate Andy Warhol movies. After listening to Kid A I am proud to say it isn't an Andy Warhol movie. It is very minimal compared to other Radiohead albums...even Ok Computer, but it all falls together so nicely that you hardly notice. Where Ok Computer is a post-modern masterpiece, Kid A is a totally new art form lamenting the staticity of 21st Century life and generally trying very hard not to care about anything. Kid A is just there...it doesn't really go anywhere, it merely exists. You listen to it and then wonder if you actually did after its over. While artistically pleasing Kid A is missing some of that token Radiohead rock goodness that I've come to love. For this reason only do I not give it 5 but 4 stars. This isn't a good album for anyone new to Radiohead, get The Bends or Ok Computer first and give them a few listens. Only then can you appreciate what is really going on in Kid A.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead certainly are not afraid to try something a little different in each successive CD.  Their first CD &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; sounds so completely different from this latest release &quot;Kid A&quot; that there's no way you'd think it was the same band.  The success of &quot;Pablo&quot; was made entirely by &quot;Creep&quot;.  Otherwise, it was just another run-of-the-mill release from another new english band and could have been forgotten about rather quickly.  The 2nd CD &quot;The Bends&quot; is more mature and catchy and though it didn't have a huge hit like &quot;Creep&quot; it was widely praised by critics.  That lead to the follow up &quot;OK Computer&quot; which took &quot;The Bends&quot; a step farther with darker, much more complex rhythms and production which conjure up thoughts of Pink Floyd and YES.  They certainly proved here thay they were not run-of-the-mill.  It was (and is) their masterpiece and to top it on their follow up would certainly seem improbable.  I couldn't wait to pick up &quot;Kid A&quot; at the record store.  Man, this baby is so far out there.  If Radiohead didn't make something better, then at least they tried to make something even more creative and groundbreaking.  Take &quot;OK Computer&quot; and throw in elements of ambient, electronica and phychadelic.<br />The CD starts out with &quot;Everything in it's right place&quot;, which sets the tone for the CD.  Thom Yorkes vocals are simple and catchy as hell at the same time.  There's no noticable rhthym and more ambient sounding.  It's pure ear candy.  Listen with headphones and hear the multiple sound blips going on in the left and right sides throughout.  What a great opener.<br />&quot;Kid A&quot; is possibly the most experiental track on the CD.  It's basically in instrumental with Yorkes voice distorted throughout.<br />&quot;The National Anthem&quot; is one of the best tracks here.  It sounds a bit like 60's psychdelica with mostly bass, drums, and loops of horns.  Youdon't hear Yorke's voice until 1:30 into the song!  And it's loud!  Now we get into more structured songs:<br />&quot;How to Disapear Completely&quot; probably reminds me of OK Computer more than any other track (such as &quot;Music-For a Film).  It's got a very strange, dark and intense orchestral track throughout.  It's probably my favorite song on the CD.<br />&quot;Treefingers&quot; is an instrumental and is basically a nice transistion to the next track..<br />&quot;Optimistic&quot; is another OK Computer-like track.  It's a slow-medium temp song and could be the most &quot;single&quot; or radio friendly song.  I like the guitar-syth interplay section in-between each verse<br />&quot;In Limbo&quot; is possibly one of the weaker, less interesting songs on the CD.<br />&quot;Idioteque&quot; is a simple song and dominated by an electronic drum beat and is basically the only instrument played here other than the vocals.<br />&quot;Morning Bell&quot; is another favorite of mine.  It's got trademark Thom Yorke, high-pitched vocals.  It's another possible radio-song but certainly unlike any typical song these days.<br />&quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; is a nice coda on Kid A.  Another ambient-like atmosphere with vocals and orchestral background.  There's also a hidden track.<br />Oh, and if you have the non-limited release version, take off the black CD-holder (the piece that the CD snaps to and is snapped onto the back CD case-cover).  You'll find an interesting surprise inside.<br />Overall, if you like all the previous Radiohead CDs, then certainly buy Kid A.  Like OKC, you'll like it more and more each time you listen to it.  I love Radiohead because they are not afraid to try new ideas and push themselves to make the most creative music of anybody else around.  They are certainly this generation's Pink Floyd but without the commercial success.  Hopefully that changes soon and they get the recognition they deserve.

6305358567|5.0|I am somewhat amused at the enraged remarks made by some of the previous reviewers.  If you are looking for factual history, read a book; there are scores of exceptional ones on Elizabeth and her reign. This is a MOVIE, not a historical rendering of Elizabeth's ascension to the throne. And as such, it was made for its entertainment, not factual, value.   Not being a member of MENSA, I was still able to follow the &quot;plotline&quot; of the film at my first &quot;partial&quot; viewing. I missed the opening sequences, and caught bits and pieces of it on cable before seeing the film in full. After doing so, I was delighted to have found another film I could watch repeatedly. First, the casting was brilliant: I agree with the previous reviewer who felt Cate Blanchett was &quot;robbed&quot; of her Oscar. Joseph Fiennes's &quot;Dudley&quot; was able to gain my sympathy despite his treachery and Geoffrey Rush was superb as always.  The film's additional casting, direction, costuming, editing and intricate story captivated me. I was not looking for flaws in these areas, or to catch some &quot;historical mistake.&quot; I was utterly entertained, and was afraid to leave the room in fear that I would miss one &quot;essential&quot; line, as the characters were multi-dimensional. If I want to learn, I go to books; I own thousands. When I want to be entertained, or escape reality, I watch a movie.  And that is why &quot;Elizabeth&quot; worked for me.  It took me out of my living room into another world, no matter how &quot;factually flawed&quot; others found that world to be.  And is it not the purpose of movies to entertain?  I don't think anyone EVER attempted to advertise this film as an accurate, factual portrayal of Elizabeth's reign. But it was good enough to make me want to know those facts, and I think that is the value of movies as entertainment. So I'm heading to the nearest bookstore to get the very best historical and factual accounting of Elizabeth's reign, in all its complex splendour.

B00004U8P9|5.0|This is a must buy for all fans of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It has every extra you can think of including a track of the audience yelling all of their rants at the screen. (&quot;Janet I love the way you beat the other girls [audience: with whips and chains]).  The DVD really does all it can to recreate the actual movie going experience.  If you already know the movie and enjoy it, stop reading and buy the thing.  If you have never seen it or are curious to know what all the fuss is about, then buy or rent RHPS. This DVD is an excellent introduction to the whole RHPS phenomenon.  I love this movie and have seen it live twice and listened to the old participation album dozens of times.  The songs are great and catchy and the performances are excellent all around.  Thank goodness this movie bombed in 1975 or it probably would have been forgotten, now it won't go away.  Overall, a great DVD double set with more than enough extras to satisfy DVD phreaks.
0811826848|5.0|As a long-time avid Beatle person, I thought nothing else could be written that would be new or informative...Wrong!! This book takes us on an insightful and thought-provoking journey back to a really magical time. After reading book after book by &quot;outsiders&quot;, it's really wonderful to be able to finally hear George, Paul, Ringo and John's take on Beatle life. The book is large, with beautiful photo's, some never before published. With Christmas just around the corner, this is a great gift, for yourself or someone you know who loves the Fabs
B00004XONN|4.0|With their fourth studio LP, Radiohead solidifies themselves as one of rock's best and most creative bands of the past 20 years. Kid A is by no means an ordinary rock album, however. The songs have little, if any, structure to them. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the band is able to fully exercise their creative muscle without the restraints of any pop-music trappings. However, I personally think that Radiohead's more commercially successful songs (High and Dry, Creep, Fake Plastic Trees) are true pieces of musical artistry, reminiscient of late-eighties, early-nineties U2. <br />Despite the lack of a true radio-song, The Kid A has some truly worthwhile tunes, among my favorites are Everything in Its Right Place, Optimistic, and Motion Picture Soundtrack. A moody and eclectic album, it definitely deserves a lot of listens. I have a feeling the meaning behind this album will become more and more clear to the listener each time they hear it.
B00004XONN|1.0|What happened with this album? What i want to know is how a talented group of musicians such as Radiohead can come out with masterpieces like &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; and then come out with this.  When i bought this CD i thought I'd hear at least something similar to the sound of Radiohead, but this is trach..techno trash..They have always been alittle techno..but they have just gone over the edge.  The are hardly any lyrics and the ones that they do have are hardly Thom Yorke-esque.  There is hardly any guitar..maybe one song..and way too much electronics..this has really made me think twice about the talent and individuality of this band.  A very sad day for music.
068484267X|4.0|This book is so depressing its funny. Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is a memoir full of thought and detail with descriptions that draw you in and have you turning pages. Frank McCourt makes it clear that with out pain and suffering there would not be joy and happiness.             One of the best qualities in the book is the character. The characters in the book are so real and defined that it is easy to feel that you know and can relate to someone you've never even met. They are full of life and have you laughing and crying. One problem with the book is that although the humor was hidden amongst the hardship was that it is to depressing. The sadness that often made the memoir moving sometimes gets really depressing and will fall in to ruts that make you want to stop reading. This doesn't happen often but when it does the book becomes fairly uninteresting.              It is hard to not read a book that is written with words that flow off the page and are almost as beautiful as the joy and happiness sprinkled within this book. The Irish dialect in the memoir really is a part of what makes this book great.                   This memoir was a great account of childhood and it is amazing the way the author can remember and describe everything in his early life. I would definitely recommend this book to reader who was looking for humor within tragedy.
0440234743|3.0|The very beginning of this book starts out great and then goes downhill pretty quickly.  The aspect of travel to South America keeps the book afloat, but the characters are nothing special.  I read the hardcover version and on the inside flap it said something to the fact that 'Nate O'Riley's latest release from rehab was going to be &quot;murder&quot;'. Considering there is no murder at all in this story, I found this to be misleading and dissapointing.
B000001DTM|5.0|I am a true music lover, form the Beatles, to Pink Floyd, Radiohead, to Rap &amp; Jazz.  This album will take you to places never seen before.  Forget the hits that youve heard on the radio, this albums non &quot;radio plays&quot; are the true gems.  This is the best rock album Ive ever heard.  I cant believe its been almoast 10 years, and my thoughts havent changed. Fav song- End of The World
B00004XONN|3.0|It seems as though everyone loves this album, but I'm not sure why.   Having eagerly awaited this new work by Radiohead, I find myself disappointed.  This album does not capture the moodiness and beauty of any of their previous work.  While it is artistic and musically creative, it is quite sterile.  It sounds like an album that was never finished.  The writing seems lazy (though the production does not).  Songs ('movements' may be a more fitting term) begin, then meander somewhat aimlessly for a few minutes, then end, as do Thom Yorke's vocals.  For someone with such a talent for singing, these talents are oddly ignored this time out.  There is little in the way of structure.  Not to insinuate that structure is essential, but something is definitely missing here.  The music borders on pretentious and boring.  The thread of genius so tastefully spun throughout 'OK Computer' is missing from this album.  I miss Radiohead doing what they do best.  Tearing at the soul through sound.  It just does not touch me emotionally.  And so what else is left?  One other reviewer said 'this is not a rock album'.  They were right.  And there is no need for it to be.  But if it does not rock and it doesn't touch me emotionally, then what is its use?<br />However, I give it 3 stars because, comparatively speaking, it is daring and inventive in its own right.  It deserves merit for it is rare to find a guitar based band put so much effort into creating the sonic textures found on the album.  I simply wish that the textures didn't sound so sterile.  (odd that the 'computer' album is full of soul yet the 'kid' album is not...)  However, if I had wanted an album of experimental music of this type, I would turn toward someone like John Zorn and Tzaddik records, not Radiohead.  Everything does have its right place, and I think Radiohead is not in it at the moment .
0811826848|5.0|This is the ultimate Beatle book for all beatle fans. Written by the Beatles, it gives a accurate description of the days of beatlemania. This book will clear up all misunderstanding anybody had from other unauthorized books about the beatles.it tells the real story from the eyes of the people that created  this amazing time in musical history. THE BEATLES!! Definitely worth the money!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|In reading other reviews of &quot;Kid A,&quot; I've seen words like &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;masterpiece&quot; thrown around.  I'm not sure if this record has been in our heads long enough to attain that status--though I have to say that I really haven't been able to stop listening to it since its release.  What I am sure of is that Radiohead is one of the few rock bands that continues to be important.  Much of that importance, I think, comes from the band's continually evolving complexity.  I can't tell you how refreshing and reassuring that is in the face of the current popular music scene in the US--which, while not without some value, so often just leaves us titillated rather than satisfied.
B00004STPT|5.0|i really like the soundtrack, specially the song earth...
B00003CXB6|4.0|Many critics are thrown off by the dark tones of the film.  However, I find The Lost World to be an excellent contribution to the Jurassic Park series.  It does not follow the formula of the first film, and therefor, Spielberg is to be commended.  The Lost World takes us to a second island.  The mysterious island where the basis of the genetic testing and research had been done.  It's a darker place, out of the eyes of the public, and is not the happy Disneyworld island that was represented in the first film.  The effects are amazing.  It's great to see Goldblum back as the most interesting character of the series.  Vaughn, Postlewaite, Moore, and Howard are more convincing and interesting characters than those in Jurassic Park.  But yes, I too have a few groans about the film.<br />Ian's daughter has no purpose to the story.  I felt she was just thrown into the film to appease the younger audience.  And I can't escape the contridictory dialogue Julian Moore's character had throughout the film. <br />Other than those two main gripes, the film is a great rollar coaster ride from the best film maker of our time.  Cheers.
0553106635|5.0|Not many folks seem to realize that you can order the TRADE PAPERBACK from amazon.co.uk and have this book in a week for less than the US hardcover price.  I did.  It took me an absorbed week of reading to finish this heavyweight (even in softcover it's heavy!), and now I'm longing for more.<br />I really enjoyed this book, mostly because of the tight plotting and deft characterisations.  Even the unlikable characters become somehow understandable.  Like in real life, sometimes the bad guys do good things, and sometimes the good guys mess up.  Martin knows how to make his world believable and richly colored, with just enough description, and carefully chosen vignettes that move the plot along.<br />As for interesting plot highlights -- the terrifing prospect of the walking dead is explored as they move south towards the wall.  Even the wall itself becomes a character of sorts, figuring heavily in the plot as the wildings try to move south to escape the wights.  (Somehow I failed to notice earlier that the whole wall is made of ice, not just ice bound.  This book made it clear.)  Daenarys continues to work with her dragons, and grows as they do.  Jon Snow wrestles with his honor and his place with the Black Watch.  But don't worry.  Bad things happen, but it all seems so right in the end.<br />Well, if you're reading these reviews, it's probably because you are already a fan and hoping for and against spoilers at the same time.  Just order the darn thing already and write off a week of free time!
B00000IQC8|4.0|I got this DVD from an online auction site for 15 bucks. Otherwise I wouldn't have purchased it.<br />The DVD is okay, there's a couple of extras, but I would have liked more. If you're seriously considering paying 40 dollars for it just buy the VHS, or try to get the DVD somewhere else.<br />Otherwise, though, the flick is great. A classic, one of my favorite movies, featuring Jeff Anderson in one of the greatest comedic supporting actor performances ever (aside from Jason Lee's plethora of great supporting actor performances.)<br />Only complaints are the female leads - their voices are so annoying (not as annoying as Joey Lauren Adams', but at least she's a good actress.)
B00004X01U|1.0|I have been a huge Madonna fan since I first heard &quot;Lucky Star&quot; when I was 6 years old back in 1983. That being said, I think that &quot;Music&quot; is her worst album to date. The first 2 songs are great, but it's all downhill from there. After &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; I can't tell the difference between the tracks. The lyrics are cliched and boring. She's at her most unisnpired here. Madonna says she's the happiest she's ever been, and I am glad for that. But if her happiness is going to be reflected in dull, droning music like this; maybe it's time she hands over her crown to someone else and stop making &quot;Music.&quot;
0811826848|5.0|The Beatles Anthology- don't let the title fool you, but this new autobiographical release by the four beatles is not simply the book adaptation of the three anthologies that were released on television in 1995. This book is the culmination of years work of a first hand perspective of the best rock and roll group of all time, and shares none of the boredom that put viewers to sleep 5 years ago while the blue glow of tv sets were tuned to abc.      While it is true that the transcipt of the tv anthologies are present in the book, it's presence doesn't really exceed that. The Beatles Anthology is a rich tapestry of the fab four constructed by beatles soundbites and interviews from the past 40 years. It is the simplistic beauty of the first hand accounts from the Beatles themselves that gives this book a sort of feeling like you were right there. Plus, the lush photography doesn't overpower the copy, but rather accentuates it, much like George Martin's producer work.      If you think, however, that everything that everything has been said and done about the beatles, get back, my friend. Revelations are prolific throughout this book. For example, did you know George Harrison lost his virginity while his three bandmates were in the same room? As well, did you know they appluaded when he was finished? Unless you were the girl he shagged, I think not.     However, I must concede that the book is so good because it is so easily re-readable. There's always something new to be found in this rich volume. While this is a must have for any beatles fan, it's a must have for anyone who wants to understand music today or why pop culture is the way it is presently. I really got the sense after this book of how bands today are shaped in the molds the Beatle's created- but moreover, I got the impression of how massive the Beatle's body of work was; a career from 1964(after Ed Sullivan)-1970 in the public eye created more singles or albums that any band today could produce in 4 years,and is amazingly recounted in 360 plus pages. All you need is love, but more over, all you need is this book.

Now imagine if you knew what you know now about music...and you could go back and hear them for the first time...in the same setting you were in long ago.    Kid A is a romantic and confusing whirl wind of sounds.  If you want a true musical experience...buy the new Radiohead album. It is the first album I have heard in a long time that is one continuous rock-opera song. They are my generations' Pink Floyd.

B00004XONN|5.0|This CD is sooooooo different and it's the kind of sound that you have to let grow on you.  When you frist hear this cd i can almost guarentee that you will not like it.  But after listening to it a few times you'll appreciate it more.  At least that was the case for me.  And plus, if you were a radiohead fan before this cd, as i was myself, i think that will help in many ways.  cuz if you truly believe in Radiohead as a group you will learn to love this cd.  but if you are just looking for the regular rock band Radiohead isn't for you.  <br />I'd have to say that the first couple songs off the cd aren't very good but i'm giving them five stars because they have a lot of guts to be so expeirmental.  they could have just made the same old music that they have in the past, but they decided to go down a differnt path and created a truly amazing and almost haunting album.  i think a couple years from now we will be hearing more of this type of music then the stuff playing today on the radio.  <br />this cd rocks out!
0671042858|5.0|As a parent, I spend considerable time trying to educate my children how to protect themselves from strangers, be aware of their surroundings when they are at the mall, be alert to the potential of dangerous situations, and, ad nauseum, what to do should this or that occur and you find yourself lost and on your own.<br />As a parent, no amount of information is enough to keep them safe in our minds.  We stand at the edge of paranoia, always geared to protecting our young. As a family, ourselves, we take our time off and go camping, hiking and exploring in the Sierras.  Ever attempting to pass on knowledge, my wild life biologist husband delivers education and passes on nuggets of survival tricks.<br /> I was impressed with the story line Stephen King delivers in this book. One child actually payed attention to the nuggets of wildlife facts her mother served up on their outings in the Maine woods. Interpreted as boring by the older brother, he oftentimes uses the occassion to protest verbally to his mother everything he hates about his life and what the divorce has done to destroy it.<br /> How fortunate that this chirpy 9 year old girl, Trisha, always eager to please and make peace anyway she can, listened to these seemingly useless tips.  In the end, these morsels of information added up and saved her life when she became lost while on a hike with her brother and Mother.<br />Trish was only trying to find a secret spot where no one could see her to pee.  Trying to pee like her mom showed her, she gets turned around and as Mr. King puts it, began making some very unfortunate decisions. Having left the main trail, it turns into a guessing game as to where and how to get back to it.  Trish loses and gets lost.<br />Her tale is one of shear guts and determination, helplessness and physical and mental stress beyond the coping mechanisms of a 9 year old.  She does however, recover the nuggets of information imparted to her by her mom, and struggles day after day to help herself.<br />One of her saviours is the love for baseball and one player in particular, Tom Gordon.  Carefully, she tries to allot herself only so much time to listen to her walkman before the batteries die and she is left without her human link and bond in a  box.  As she tries to conserve the batteries, her imagination and stress induced hallucinations bring Tom Gordon to her.  As she  challenges herself with the struggle of just getting enough water and a few berries to eat a day, she senses an ominous presence that has been following her day after day, night after night.<br />A griping novel, one that makes you love and cry for this young, lost girl, it is full of drama, intensity and mystery.elp herself.<br />One of her saviours is the love for baseball and one player in particular, Tom Gordon.

0811826848|4.0|One of the fine things about this book is that it was actually written by the Beatles. It is a very large book and packed full of photographs, many of which are very interesting if for no other reason than they are well-documented photo shoots with variations (such as a few selections of the group crossing Abbey Road). Many of the photos are a bit small, and this detracts somewhat from the book, but overall it is a very interesting, fine book. The sad part is, that after reading this book, one gets the idea that one will never have to read another Beatles book. A definite must for all Beatles fans.
6302968143|5.0|A word of warning:  Parents of children under 7 please heed the PG rating if you wish to avoid the inevitable nightmares this movie will cause!<br />I first caught Hocus Pocus during a Disney Channel free preview, and was, to say the least, reluctant in watching it.  But about halfway through (and through the visual stimuli of Vinessa Shaw) I found myself actually enjoying the movie.  The next time it was on I watched again.  Thus, a Halloween tradition was born.  Watching for the eventual appearance of this movie on Disney proved somewhat tedious and so I made the purchase. Now it's a staple Halloween viewing at my house that the entire family enjoys.  It did used to scare the pants off my sister (there are some pretty heavy elements to this film, such as the death of a sibling and the witches desire to eat children) but now that she's older she enjoys it as much, if not more, than I do.  For the guys there are two lovely ladies in the cast that make this worth viewing, Sarah Jessica Parker and Vinessa Shaw.  For the kiddies (the target audience) there's trick or treating, witches, a talking cat, ghosts, and fun for all!  If you have kids or ever were one yourself, or if you just love Halloween, take Hocus Pocus for a spin.  It'll put a spell on you!!
B00000ADG2|4.0|I read angry reviews from presumably white people who hate to see a black woman do so well. If you assume Lauryn Hill is a racist (she's not--I read it in a friggin' magazine that it was a lie and she says it is herself)--I'll assume that if you hold such rage against Ms. Hill it's because you're angry that she's black and successful. REALLY. If she was white, would you be so contemptuous of her? I think not.<br />It's sad to see what racists are out there. Lauryn is not one of them. Want proof? Rosie O'Donnell hosted the grammys when Lauryn won album of the year, and told the audience and millions of viewers that &quot;miseducation . . . &quot; was her favorite album of the decade. HAs Lauryn done anything bad in response to it? No. Cuz she's not racist. <br />Now, the music. This album is artistic, beautiful, gritty, powerful, and introspective. It's all about art and emotion; no frills here. I'm not a big fan of hip-hop and I totally love this album and relate to it. &quot;To Zion&quot; is profound, &quot;Ex-Factor&quot; is a great breakup song, and &quot;Lost Ones&quot; is awesome. Her two extra covers at the end of the album are wonderful. <br />I really enjoyed this album, and so have millions of people of all races the world wide. So quit your bellyaching, all you whiny people out there. Let us enjoy it.
B00004XONN|4.0|KID A is sober, somber, stark, serious stuff.  I haven't a clue what the &quot;narrative&quot; of this brilliant record is, but it is clearly woven together throughout (I think they used to call these &quot;concept albums&quot;).  Early on, the speaker/narrator denies his own reality (&quot;this isn't happening&quot;). But by &quot;Idioteque&quot; he has awakened to a nightmare reality that is infinitely more tragic and frightening; &quot;This is really happening,&quot; Thom Yorke sings, his voice sounding as startled as Mia Farrow's in ROSEMARY's BABY as she realizes through her drug-dream-fog that she is, in fact, about to copulate with the Devil.<br />Yes, lads; indeed it is hard to feel optimistic about our world, which seems to be turning more and more into one big money grab, a cash cow planet, the last pork chop.  The technocratic late capitalist vision of KID A is a logical extension of OK COMPUTER. The former lacks most of the latter's pop catchiness, but what sense is there in singing pretty songs if the ship is sinking?  Then again, much of KID A sticks in the head as firmly as &quot;Lucky&quot; does, even if the melodies (as such) might make one feel grim about the mouth.  A few of the tracks are as static as death (and this might be the point); others are overflowing with something much closer to beauty.       <br />I have loads of respect for Radiohead.  They will get older and maybe less serious and, maybe, heaven forbid, less idealistic.  But now, they are a band that we--those of us who care--can latch on to and treasure.  Since The Clash has been out of business (and how!) for almost twenty years, perhaps we can resurrect the dead phrase, &quot;The only band that matters&quot; in this case.
B000002I2G|5.0|This album is very special in it's own unique way. Sounding quite different from earlier efforts it contains tracks that work perfectly with it's orchestral backing and ultimately creates a sound that's spine chillingly nostalgic today.. Wild Child is thumping acid rock,while Wishful Sinful is one of the most captivating ballads ever performed by any artist.<BR>The title track The Soft Parade is a funky masterpiece that has certainly stood the test of time.<BR>If you haven't heard the The Soft Parade, you haven't heard The Doors.
0800132335|5.0|The earlier war movies (up to 1970) always show unrealistic bravery. I guess they were made to promote national superiority. But lately we start seeing the meaning of war and its side effects. Das Boot is the only movie that clearly shows people like you and me fighting in a war we don't understand. The only movie that comes close to this one is U-571.
0811826848|5.0|I've just begun to enjoy reading and paging through the new Beatle's Anthology book.  It's hard to believe it's been over 35 years that they came into our lives!  This book helps bring back the old memories yet make them fresh at the same time.<br />It's intriguing how a quote here and a quote there made over time by John Lennon are woven chronologically into his memories of the evolution of this phenomonal musical powerhouse.<br />Enjoy the quotes, the pictures, the stories...then relive the music!
B00000AFFI|4.0|If i would have to sum up this album in one word it would be &quot;interesting&quot; - theres alomst not a dull moment in the cd - with each song sounding different from the other. There are quiet moody songs like &quot;catherine&quot; along with disquieting powerful songs such as &quot;joy&quot;.  All in all it is a very good cd, but if comparing to the other pj harvey cd I have - To bring you my love - i would say this lacks the raw emotion in that cd, maybe because it seems as if pj is just singing other peoples  feelings and not her own,  and maybe a bit too much experimental. BUT none the less - recommended!
B000002UAR|5.0|It's so hard to write reviews of albums like this...it's undeniably a classic, and you really can't tell anybody anything about them that they don't already know.  But what the hey, I'm gonna try anyway...!<br />Revolver is, in my opinion, the Beatles' crowning achievement...the one where they took all their varied and diverse influences and ran them through their genius filter. It's more advanced than Help and Rubber Soul, and more focused than Sgt. Pepper and the White Album. It's smooth and professional, but not slick like Abbey Road...I believe it was the first time that their ability as players and arrangers (as well as the invaluable assistance of George Martin) matched up with the ideas they had going on in their head. They were all truly on the same page this time.<br />One could (and I will...watch out, here we go!) go song by song and point out examples of this...George's &quot;Taxman&quot; with its dour humor, signature riff and killer guitar solo; the elegant &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, featuring another great string arrangement by Martin and some of Paul's best lyrics ever; &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;, John's ode to sloth, with the imaginative touches that seemed to just flow from him back then like the backwards-masked guitar licks and nice bass from Paul; George's sitar exercise &quot;Love You To&quot; with its infamous &quot;make love singing songs&quot; lyric (that sounds hard to do...), groundbreaking at the time; &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; in which Paul and buds tip their cap to Brian Wilson and the Boys; &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; an inventive and charming kiddie song for grownups; &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, in which John relates an acid-soaked conversation with a stinging guitar lick; &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;, which sounds like Paul might have been listening to the Kinks or some sort of vaudevillian music hall stuff and is effortlesly happy go lucky, in contrast to the sad &quot;For No One&quot; which may or may not have been an account of Paul's breakup with Jane Asher...sandwiched in between is one of my all time favorite Beatletunes, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot;, which John may have dismissed much later, but has always hooked me with its Byrdsy dual guitar riff and great harmony vocals; &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; also is clever and witty (John wrote it, of course...) with another outstanding riff at its base and more great BV's; &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot; is George's attempt to do Motown, but it turns out to be the only weak link here-contrast it to Paul's &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot; which challenges Berry Gordy and Co. to a grudge match and holds its own admirably...Paul said many years later it was about marijuana (!); and finally, the piece-de-resistance psychedelic masterpiece &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; which features more wit, imagination, and creativity in its 2 plus minutes than some musicians have shown in their entire lifetime.<br />Whew!<br />Look, you can't go wrong with any Beatles album, and I love them all, but not all equally. You ask me where to start, and I say here. You'll thank me later.
B000000W6X|5.0|call it trip hop , call it techno , call it hip hop or alternative music, whatever i dont care! The only thing i do know is that i like it. Original and intensely intelligent stuff. The  cd includes rap tunes such as &quot;karmacoma&quot; and &quot;eurochild&quot; which  just beg to get addicted to , jazzy piano tunes such as &quot;weather storm&quot; and &quot;heat miser&quot;, funky songs with a jamaican flare to it such as &quot; spying glass&quot; and the remix to the doors' &quot;light my fire&quot; and thats just the half of it.<br />I think I've said enough.
B000001E3L|3.0|You've got to hand it to a man who can sing a song about a metaphysical stairway and make it sound sexy.  I never understood what Van was doing with &quot;Vanlose&quot; on BEAUTIFUL VISION. He sang it  like he was passing kidney stones. Here, you still can't understand anything he is saying, but you can sure feel it.  And the sax and guitar lines really do something.  &quot;Send me some lovin' / send me some kissin' / You know it's you I'm missin'&quot;, Yeah!

B00004XONN|4.0|I can't understand why people keep saying that Bends fans or Pablo Honey fans won't like this album.  I haven't met too many people in the last couple years who still talk about &quot;Creep&quot; or &quot;High &amp; Dry,&quot; have you?  Most of them are more into the OK Computer side of Radiohead, and were eagerly awaiting to hear the group's latest sonic oddyssey.  And here it is.  When it's all said and done, this is a stopgap album.  The band has claimed that much themselves; this would explain why they're assuring everyone that another, more &quot;traditional&quot; album will be out within a year's time.  But what a stopgap album it is.  Kid A is like a remixed pop album, like Radiohead sent a bunch of guitar &amp; bass songs to some avante garde techno remixer and got this back from him.  But the cool thing is, this is Radiohead themselves.  It's their &quot;Metal Machine Music,&quot; I guess.  But it does have some great songs, three in particular: &quot;Idioteque,&quot; which is fascinating because it sounds nothing like the Radiohead we know and love.  It sounds like Thom Yorke sitting in the studio with Autechre, and that's a good thing.  That part about 2 minutes into the song where Yorke starts singing against the dissonant backbeats, that's rock &amp; roll, my friends.  &quot;How to Disapear Completely&quot; is one haunting, incredible song, and sounds just as much like something that could've been on OK Computer as the other great song on Kid A, &quot;Optimistic.&quot;  The only problems I have with the album are &quot;Treefingers,&quot; which is too much Eno and too little anything else, and meanders along into nothingness.  The other problem I have is with the song &quot;Kid A&quot; itself.  Radiohead took what could've been a great song and ruined it with unintelligible, processed vocals that were screwed around with for no other reason than to make the song sound &quot;weird.&quot;  It's like the voice from OK Computer's &quot;Fitter, Happier&quot; singing the song, and it just doesn't work.  This song live, however, is really great, sounding for all the world like a mid-'80s Prince song, and that's why I'm a little upset that they've made it so unaccessible on the album itself.  But other than that, I'd say this is a great album, especially if you're more into the electronica set.  Radiohead have tried their best to make an experimental album with something for everyone, and like the song says, the best you can is good enough. In this day and age of Korn and Matchbox whoever, it's great to see a group who keeps alive the spirit of the '60s: honestly trying to evolve their music with each album.  I just wish they'd finally get around to releasing &quot;True Love Waits,&quot; hopefully on the next album.  Those of you who have heard this song in concert or on bootlegs know what I'm talking about.  Those who haven't...well, you're in for a treat.singing the song, and it just doesn't work.

0440234743|2.0|Another story from Mr Grisham about the volunteers fighting for the idea and about the lawyers willing to give up their millions for this idea and I will never buy his book anymore. Great beginning with the old millionaire creating his intrigue, but then... big disappointment - there is no intrigue at all (exactly like in the &quot;Street lawyer&quot;). No idea how to develop the plot. Looks like Mr Grisham has just fallen in love with the Brazilian forests and wanted to write something about that. I was reading it and waiting for something to happen and suddenly... I got to the end. Where is the plot, intrigue and suspense from the &quot;Pelican Brief&quot; or &quot;Partner&quot;?

630575067X|5.0|Okay, let me say something to all of you who don't like &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; for whatever silly reason or another. First of all, don't expect one movie to completely change your life, people. Episode I is only the beginning of the saga, and there are two more to finish the trilogy. The complete story is not told in Episode I, just as it wasn't told in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;. What Episode I focuses on is the beautiful times of the Galaxy before the rise of the empire, which will be explored in the next two movies. If you don't understand that, then leave your negative comments to yourself. The only movie last year better than Episode I was &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  I thought &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; had a great storyline. If you didn't read the opening credits that explained the story, then that is why you got lost during the movie. All props to George Lucas for continuing to write the magnificent story of Star Wars.
0671034065|5.0|This was my first Linda Howard book and it won't be my last!  I bought it on a whim in hardcover, which is something I usually don't do, but this book was worth it!<br />Jaine Bright and her 3 friends meet after work on Friday night and create a list of what the perfect man would be.  Soon after, that the List gets public attention and almost overnight makes the women stars.  One by one the women start to get murdered and Jaine soon realizes she's next.<br />In the midst of all the suspense and mystery, Jaine starts a hot and heavy romance with her hunky neighbor, Sam who happens to be a detective.  Together they try to discover who the killer is before it's too late.<br />This book is the perfect mix of mystery, romance, and humor.  Jaine is probably the best fictional character I've read in awhile.  She's tough as nails with a sense of humor to match!  You can't help but laugh out loud reading some of the dialog between Jaine and Sam.  I wish that Ms. Howard would make a series out of these characters because I sure would enjoy reading about them again!
0679460063|2.0|I am a big Cornwell fan; however, this is the first time I purchased an audio version of her book to enjoy on a long car ride.  The book is ruined by this particular reader, Kate Reading.  I cannot finish listening to it so I plan on getting a printed version to finish it.  I am not against audio versions and have enjoyed many other authors in the past.  The publisher/author need to do a better job finding an appropriate reader to interpret the text.
0446677450|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a co-worker and I am so glad that I picked it up!  Robert Kiyosaki writes on a level you can understand easily.  It is his story of success and how that financial freedom is achievable for all of us.  I have just ordered 'Cash Flow Quadrants', and I will eagerly await its arrival in my mailbox.  I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to 'get out of the rat race' or simply begin building a nest egg for retirement.  The most important lesson in this book is learning the difference between an asset and a liability.  Robert Kiyosaki explains the benefits of knowing how the tax laws work, and shows you how to manipulate them in your favor.
0811826848|5.0|Just what you'd expect from the Beatles -- an extremely high-quality product created for the purpose of delighting their fans.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable book, loaded with wonderful photographs and drawings, as well as the stories and recollections of each of the Beatles.  The story of their enormous popularity and creativity is unique in the history of popular culture and this book brings it all to life in a very entertaining way.
6304078145|2.0|Lawrence Benders' surreal comedy is split into four sequences, linked by bell boy, Tim Roth as he goes through each room, dealing with off the wall customers. Its all a bit of a hit and miss affair. Ambitious and seemingly desperate to plumb new depths, it often fails with many scenees falling flat. This is all the more surprising when it has such an impressive and talented cast which includes Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Quentin Tarentino, David Proval and Amanda De Cadanet. The whole thing holds a few laughs along the way but on the whole its only very moderatley enjoyable. See it only if curiosity gets the better of you.
B0000035GN|5.0|Once again, I am amazed by reviewers who trash a band that moves away from its perspective musical style and tries something new. Sebadhoh's Bakesale is quite different than anything they have ever done before, but that is cool as hell!! First off, &quot;Not a Friend&quot; is one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful songs I have ever heard. &quot;Careful&quot; is powerful, especially the line, &quot; And God only knows, I need a balance&quot;. The album is perfection from the first line Lou sings in &quot;Liscense to Confuse&quot;, where he expresses, &quot;I'm not attractive today, I'm not a sight for sore eyes&quot;. Lou Barlow is our generation's Lou Reed. Love him, respect him, and buy this amazing Lo-Fi Pop masterpiece!

Not as good as i'd expected with the casting of the capable Michelle Pfieffer in the leading role but is defintley worth a look and at best can be described as entertaining, with a few interesting sub plots along the way. Its not really origanal with its typical fantasy, feel good factor about the tough being tamed, but boasts some good performances and some scenes are genuinley moving. Purley judged on its own merits, its good and worth a look. Recommended.

6300271439|1.0|As much as i love Madonna, this dreadful comedy, which has the wafer thin plot of a lawyer finding it difficult to cope with his client (Madonna), recently released from jail, is one of the worst films i've ever seen. Its not as bad as SHANGHAI SURPRISE but the whole thing screams along at a hectic pace, holding very few laughs and has no depth what so ever for you to even begin to like the characters. Forget it!
B000002H97|4.0|This is by no means their best--Master of Puppets will always hold that distinction, but it is good.  They are still metal here.  They changed, yes.  That's what most bands do, after all, after several years in the business.  If you don't like it, fine, don't buy it, but don't go and scream sellout becuase they changed.  If you want to try to show that, look at the whole Napster mess, not thier music. Oh, and &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot; is an awesome song, best on the CD.

Excellent cast here with Harrison Ford in the title role, who gives the character the realism and depth needed to pull a challenging film like this off. Also in the cast is Tommy Lee Jones who is equally excellent as the ruthless cop on the trail of Ford and also Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano and Julianne Moore.<br />Keith Barish and Arnold Ropelson pull off this thriller triumphantly. Its a real winner! A classic masterpiece which earnt Tommy Lee Jones an oscar for Best Actor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
B00004XONN|2.0|have anyone heard of an album called passengers OS1?which is released by U2 5 years ago,and its even better then this one, i'm a big big radiohead fan from the bend,and they always bring suprise to me,but this time,i'm totally disappointed,coz they did something which has aready been done by someone else. and lets not talk about the &quot;alternative&quot;thing.this one sounds basically annoying,and makes me keep going to next track and ask myself &quot;if there something better await there?&quot;maybe they were searching something new during this album,maybe they will find what they will be,but to me,if the next album is something like this one.i won't listen to them anymore.purely disappointed.
6301208773|5.0|A powerful, action movie which keeps you in suspense throughout! Bruce Willis plays a cop who battles with terroists who have taken over the building where his wife and children are. The visual effects are stunning, dialogue fast and very sharp and as always a great, beleavable performance from Bruce Willis. Amongst the rest of the cast include bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alan Rickman and Paul Gleason. One of the best action movies i've seen. A definite classic! Highly recommended!!!!!
0684853523|4.0|This quirky memoir is as much fun as a Saturday matinee with a double feature from American International Pictures on the bill ... <br />However, it is autobiography much more than instruction. That's not a criticism, just a friendly warning to people who might think &quot;On Writing&quot; is a how-to book. There are plenty of those out there (maybe too many). There's only one Stephen King and as the (very) old song says, &quot;he's an education in himself.&quot;
6303212379|5.0|Indiana Jones type adventure, directed by ever capable Steven Speilberg. <br />A group of kids discover a pirate map which leads them on a fantasy treasure hunt. Lots of fun to be had here where the gang encounter boobie traps along the way, as well as watershoots and also have to avoid some evil crooks hot on their trail which features an exceptionally funny performance from Anne Ramsey (THROW MAMA FROM THE TRAIN). The ending has a pleasant, sentimental twist to it even though a little on the predictable side. The cast includes a very young looking Sean Astin as well as Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton and Ke Huy Kwan.<br />Excellent fun, games and adventures which kids will lap up. A classic. Highly recommended.

B000002H97|5.0|WOW! I used to listen to some of Master of Puppets when I was in grade school, but kinda grew out of metal. I have matured and realize that I miss Metallica's sound. Pick this album up if you haven't! It is a must for any music fan.  Track for track, I believe this is Metallica's best album, as sales have shown, many people agree with me. Black or Metallica's self titled album is their biggest selling album yet.  Their diversity makes this album hard on some tracks and mellow on others. Sit back and enjoy this masterpiece.
0684853523|3.0|What can I say? Not King's sort of book, but then again, he's all over the place: can't contain him, can you? Some of his ideas and suggestions are interesting, but all in all, I prefer him when he stays within the boundaries of his B-novel nightmarish stories.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Metallica has done it again. Only they could pull off an album combining a world famous symphony and metal/hard rock. Every Metallica fan should own this one! I was very nervous about buying this CD and to be honest thought that Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra sounded lame, BOY, was I wrong. I haven't stop listening since I bought this album They orchestra is excellent and they compliment Metallica in all the right places. Enjoy this musical experiment because it works very well and sounds great.
B00004XONN|5.0|The first time I heard tracks from the new, brilliant CD Kid A was at the concert in Nijmegen on Sept 16, I was blown away and very anxious to get the new CD. Although I bought the faulty version (the tracks have been botched up in manufacturing, I believe only Western Europe has this problem except for UK) I was pushed into listening to this gem in one take. My expectations were met to say the least.  The first time I listened to it I had to get used to it, but now after 2 days my discman doesn't want to let it go. I have to listen to it on and on.<br />People have been saying that this album is very different from their other work, and I agree. The mood on this album is so incredibly haunting that it made me cringe listening to Thom Yorke's voice on How To Disappear Completely.  The use of Drum computers on several tracks told me that this is really the band I thought they were. These guys are willing to take desperate measures to achieve what they set out to do. Amaze people and tell people what their vision is of music. Not all this R&amp;B and Britney bull we have on TV all day. I am glad to hear that they will probably NOT release any singles from this album, thank god, 'cause this is not music meant for the masses, this is music for people who know music. Taste is one thing, ART is a whole nother ballgame.<br />The other thing I thought when I first heard these songs at the gig in Nijmegen was how they made me think of U2. Now, people don't get mad, I mean to say that U2 is a band of people who are often fed up with what they are doing and in the last 20 years they have been changing their sound continuously. This is very much the same here with Radiohead. I love them for it.<br />With every time I play this record it keeps on getting better and better. Where Fitter Happier and Electioneering were 2 tracks on OKC that did not belong in the equation to my taste, they have been able to make a complete work of art of Kid A from A to Z.<br />I'll stop rambling now. If you have something to say about this review, please mail or ICQ 5748922<br />Can't wait for the next (geeze the album has been out 3 days!!!)
0393317552|4.0|The basic premise of this book is that the global dominance of Western societies can be traced to geographic advantages at its roots, rather than to biological or social superiority. Jared Diamond presents a well documented, coherent case that Western civilization was predisposed to success by an abundance of food crops, domesticatable animals, and a geography that facilitated migration of these skills and people. He presents those points well, and if you have not encountered discussion of the effect of geography and natural biology on the growth and development of civilizations, this book will present the basic ideas to you in a clear, if a bit rambling, style.<br />Unfortunately, the author overplays his hand in several ways. This book explicitly aims to repudiate western civilization's claim to superiority. Much of the discussion is subordinated to this political aim, and as a result turns into a polemic against cultural arrogance, rather than attempting a balanced discussion of possible and likely effects. In the service of equalizing moral stature among all civilizations, we are told that western domination is only the result of incidental geographic circumstances. Western civilization is winning because the deck was stacked in its favor from the start, the author argues cogently - and therefore any superiority of its cultural institutions and traditions is only a &quot;proximate cause&quot; of success, and thus to be disregarded as secondary and unimportant. That last jump does not compute.<br />Still, this is a good book, and an enjoyable read. Jared Diamond may be ignoring half of the story of civilization - cultural institutions, religion, the role of doctrine and tradition - but he presents his half well, if a bit over-zealously. Try to take the facts without the political payload, and you will benefit as well enjoy yourself.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|To say &quot;When the pawn...&quot; is a good album is as big an understatement as saying The Titanic didn't like icebergs. No one word can explain the rollercoaster of intensity this album takes you through. From the hatred of &quot;Limp&quot; to the hurt of &quot;Paper Bag&quot; this is a whirlwind of emotions that after listening to I felt liberated. Fiona Apple has inspired me in every aspect of my life with her profound lyrics and harmonic melodies. The woman is a musical genius.

B000001F3C|5.0|This U2 cut is definitely amongst the best and it pains me, why people havent heard about it. And when I heard U2's new cut, goes back to their old sound, I just wish its like WAR.<br />To me, to understand U2, you have to hear WAR. This is an album, which even if they didnt have their music talent could sail into one of the best lyrical album. Just love the &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;.<br />If you are a serious U2 fan or aspiring, I strongly recommend this master peice. I am super U2 crazy, so much so that I own WAR on MD, CD, LP and Cassette.<br />BUY THIS :)
B000000H42|5.0|Mercyful Fate has been around for nearly 20 years, and to date, they have not disappointed me, but in the end, their second album, &quot;Don't Break The Oath&quot;, released back in '85, is still the very best that the group has offered.  The original release was a brutal assault on the senses, which made it an instant favorite, and delivered nine of the most blistering heavy metal tracks I have ever heard.  Do you every wonder what the follow up to this album would have been, had MF not broken up?  <br />Fortunately, King Diamond had a loyal following, and when MF disolved, he continued to supply his fans with 'state of the art' heavy metal, releasing &quot;Fatal Portrait&quot;, and even then fortune conspired to reunite Mercyful Fate, and today we have an array of music bearing one name or the other, and even a compilation entitled &quot;A Dangerous Meeting&quot;, which bears the name of both.  Regardless of which name appears on the cover, you are garanteed a sonic experience that leaves the listener wondering what the Hell just happened.  The only bad thing I can say about this artist, is that his albums don't seem to last long enough, but thanks to optical technology, you can press the repeat button on the player, and the sound never degrades (Unless you render your speakers into piles of rubble).<br />This remastered version includes an early demo, &quot;Death Kiss&quot;, which lent it's musical structure to &quot;A Dangerous Meeting&quot;, which is argued to be the earliest Mercyful Fate song commercially available.  This album is a MUST HAVE.  It deserves six stars.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead are proving themselves to be positively Beatlesque in the sheer progression and evolution of their sound from album to album, and KID A is as much an artistic and stylistic leap from OK COMPUTER as REVOLVER was from RUBBER SOUL.  Trust me, the lofty comparison is apt -- we are in the midst of something wonderful, folks....
B0000399WI|5.0|One of the best phrases in the movie.  Of course here it is edited.  I have noticed some downgrading this movie for the language.  I really didn't notice any excessive foul language.  If there was none you would have to wonder if this is a pre-scool or a prison.  If you are going to a 'R' rated movie set in a prison.....grab a clue.<br />This was just a phenominal film.  Excellent story line,  exceptional acting and one of the best endings in history.  I read the book when it first came out and this is one of those few where you can't say &quot;the book was better&quot;.
0553106635|5.0|&quot;Storm of Swords&quot; is the third installment in George R.R. Martin's rousing &quot;Song of Fire and Ice&quot; story cycle.  Quite simply, this is the finest fantasy series since Tolkein, bar none.  And though it may be hard to believe, each installment gets better and more riveting than the last.  The writing is outstanding, the characters are alive, the political machinations as facinating as Washington DC...or Belgrade.  My only regret is that after waiting more than a year for the book, I read it straight through, day and night.  Hurry George, publish the next volume!    MC

B00000G3PA|1.0|If I stuck 50,000 chimpanzees in a room with 50,000 typewriters and let them randomly punch away at the keys for 3 days straight, they'd still come up writing something exponentionally better than the screenplay for Armageddon. This film is mind-bogglingly horrible. To think that sentient beings actually congregated and wrote this abomination is a mystery for the Ages. The fact that this piece of crap was so successful is further proof that mankind is regressing in its cognitive evolution.<br />   If I was given a choice between being sentenced 5 years in a Turkish prison and having to sit through this film (in its entirety) again, I'd hop on the next jumbo jet to Istanbul! <br />1 star is 1 too many. Anyone who gave it more than that should really take a long, hard look in the mirror.
0694520470|5.0|This book should be read by anyone who wants to start their own business or who works in marketing.  Even if you don't agree with all of the authors' positions, it definitely gets you to think.  It is very easy to read (there is even some humor thrown in) and can be read in one sitting.  I highly recommend it.
B00004XONN|2.0|Dear Radiohead and Radioheaders<br />Whatever you were trying to express with this new CD if you expressed it as you wished, three cheers to you, but I must say that Kid A was a big disapointment to me.  I think you would find it wise to your music your fans that love your music and yourselves to put away your computers your turntables and your London Symphony Orchestra and go back to your roots of being a Guitar Bass Drum Band, that was much more moving music, you don't need all the digital FX to get it all out...Creep Acoustic and Creep reg. was beautiful it makes me so emotional when i hear it but i'm not sure what Kid A makes me do except ask for my money back, sorry to sound dickish, but thats me.<br />If I wanted Techno I would have bought Techno, i want Street Spirit Radiohead. Bring it back.<br />Mikes
B00004X01U|5.0|Anyone who buys a new Madonna release expecting it to resemble any of her past work is missing the point! Madonna is the ultimate chameleon - moving and changing with the times - and her Music is no exception. This album is fantastic - and a reflection of Madonna's growth as an artist and vocalist. She has nothing left to prove - and if you get this then you'll get Music.
0811826848|5.0|Excellent book, many unknown facts about the Beatles, plus its very interesting to hear some stories straight from the people who experienced them. Must have for any Beatles or music fan, the definitive Beatles book.
B00004XONN|5.0|While it does lack in number of songs, Kid A makes up for it in length and quality. An odd, yet interesting rock/techno album with the same classic goodness of Radiohead. This CD has tunes from slow and strange techno, to fast and catchy jazz elements. Plus, with unreleased songs such as Egyptian Song, and Dollars and Cents, I can't wait for a fifth album sometime soon. If you liked Ok Computer, then you'll definitely want to pick this one up as soon as you can.
B00004X01U|1.0|What can I say...not much at the moment 'cause I 'm truly disappointed I bought the CD! Ray of Light was a brilliantly produced CD, but this one is nothing more than a good marketing hype for Madonna's European fans who are obviously more in-tune to the current techno-electronica music. If you really like music, The Immaculate Collection is still the best ever CD from Madonna. That's my 2 cents worth...
B00004XONN|5.0|I support anything Radiohead do. I just want to tell everyone to pull the black CD mounting out of the jewel case for a big surprise....
B000003N89|5.0|Love Nat King Cole, and I love Diana Krall.   She really makes these tunes timeless.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Just got my Green Day cd in the mail today and I am very pleased with it.  Sort of a cross between Kerplunk and Dookie, but not nearly as old school punk as 1,039.  All in all it sounds great and I'm glad that I bought it.
0525945636|4.0|Ken Follett makes a return to the Cold War in this tightly-paced thriller. Set over less than 48 hours in 1958, it follows the story of a man with no memory. Waking up in a train-station toilet, Follett's hero has no idea who is is or why he's there. Was it a drinking binge, or are there more sinister forces at work? Naturally, it's the latter. In this case sinister equates to CIA, where a rogue Agent has targetted our man for removal. Needing to establish his identity, and find out why he's important enough to have that identity rubbed out, Follett's hero follows an ingenious series of logical steps. Discovering that he's named Luke is the easy part, discovering why he's in all this trouble will take the brains of a rocket scientist. Which means it's fortunate that he is one. But who is trying to remove him from the US's fledgling space program? How does it tie in to his days at Harvard? And why is a government agent involved?  Follett's plot has more precision than a NASA engine, despite being at times a little politically simple. As usual we're treated to flashes of humour, sex, and character insight, though never enough to slow the inexorable pace of Luke's race against time to find himself and save the space program. That pace is what we read Follett for, and in this neat and clever thriller, he delivers in spades.
B00004XONN|5.0|This was one of the most difficult first listens I've ever undertaken. Kid A is quite simply a difficult record. Gone are the melody and structure that rang out through the first 3 records. The majority of Kid A is a bunch of tinkering, tinkering that unless in the context of the entire album, tends to fall flat at times. The song Optomistic seems to buck that trend, standing out as about the only single-esque song on Kid A. But this is a fine thing, the rest are worthy enough indeed. There are times when Kid A wails and moans in a very moving fashion, other times it becomes a bit annoying. But after a few listens I got the idea, and liked what I heard.  Is this as good as OK Computer? Well its quite hard to compare the two, but NO, not even close in my opinion. Is it as good as The Bends? Well its quite hard to compare the two, but NO, not even close in my opinion. (It is better than Pablo Honey) I believe that this was a album that Radiohead needed to make, just to get going into something they obviously feel passionate about. I just hope it yields something more close to home in the near future.  KID A is a grand experiment and a wonderous place they have decided to take (and drag) us to, just watch out for the bears.
B0000024JA|5.0|This CD is bangin!   The lyrics are tight as hell, especially on track 6. (Meth vs Chef)  The beats are raw, hella WU-TANG!  This CD is a classic debut, same category as Illmatic, Ready to Die, and Reasonable Doubt.  Pick it up fa sho!
B00004U8H4|5.0|I saw American Psycho at the movies but nothing captures the spirit of the film as watching it at home on your DVD player.   I can't believe that the one scene they deleted to get a R vs. NR-17 rating was considered that graphic.   Nevertheless, if you liked the movie, you'll love the DVD home version.
B00004T8RK|2.0|I was a fan ever since Mother Love Bone came out and the next two albums by pearl jam per se (addition of eddie) ARE the ultimate in grunge music. I know eddie hasn't lost his passion and voice but the songs on Binaural just doesn't have the punch as in earlier albums.. except maybe couple of songs. The albums has a great start but fizzles out a little too early just when you are jamming up and are at that high that you are so used to if you like the songs such as 'rearview mirror'....<br />I'm seeing them live in couple of weeks in mountain view and I just hope they play more of their older songs... jeremy spoke in spoke in ~ ~ jeremy spoke in classss todayyy
B000002AH1|5.0|This disc is down right nasty. Some of Miles' electric albums will drive you insane with the same groove over and over (Pangea, Agartha, Big Fun....still good cd's) -not this cd. This disc is more varied and it all works. Miles, Mclaughlin, DeJohnette &amp; company smoke the live stuff, while the studio tracks are airy and cool. A great disc.
0679879269|3.0|Phillip Pullman got our hopes up with the magnificently written The Golden Compass. The Subtle Knife was almost as good. The Amber Spyglass was a disapointment. I waited two agonizing years, mired in suspense awaiting this book's arrival. Pullman's writing is just as good as his first two books, but his message is unclear and confusing. Pullman goes a little overboard with the good and evil/hero villan message. Pullman also shys away from the imaginitive writing that made his first two books so good. There are few new innovative characters and creatures and more repetitive religious quests and implications. Pullman's writing about the journey to the land of the dead is long and drawn out, almost boring. It is totally unlike Pullman's usually vibrant and creative style of writing. The dialouge in this book is also atypical of Pullman's conversational writing. The dialougue doesn't flow like it did in past Pullman stories. However there are some bright spots in this story. The chapters about the Meufala and their society are brillantly crafted and very interesting. The ever-twisting plot did keep me on the edge of my seat for a good part of the story. I think it will be interesting to hear what  kind of reviews Pullman gets for this book. Buy this book and see what you think.
0780631684|4.0|The ending was way too obvious, but I liked the premise.

0767821769|5.0|This is a 5, to me.  Sure, I'm a dad, and not a mom, and sure, this does seem like a bit of a &quot;chick flick&quot;... but it's not.<br />It's something much more powerful.<br />Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, and Ed Harris make this movie believable and there's so many scenes where the feelings are so strong, either happy or sad, that you can't help but shed a tear.<br />The reality of being &quot;the evil step-mom&quot;, of children rejecting new loves, of the hateful/hurtful games that angry parents can play...  This movie portrays the best and worst that love can bring out...<br />The movie finishes up by bringing it all home, with a powerful message that loving is better than hating, that there is so much hate, sometimes you have to stop being selfish, and you have to take a while and learn to love one another.<br />You can't get much better than this one.  Get it.  Watch it with your significant other, your mother, whoever...  be prepared to feel deep down in your soul... it will happen.
B00004U8PA|5.0|The 25th Anniversary VHS release of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; is almost everything any fan could hope for, and certainly the best representation of the film ever delivered to the mass market.  This video was released to coincide with &quot;Rocky&quot;'s appearance on DVD, and the upgrade in quality is brilliant.  First, the video transfer is stunningly gorgeous.  The vibrantly-colored sets, costumes and makeup fairly leap off the screen.  This is certainly the best I have ever seen &quot;Rocky&quot; look, even in the theater, which makes it all the more frustrating that Fox did not see fit to release a widescreen VHS version.  This is, no doubt, a tactic to induce more fans to buy the DVD, as is the absence of even one of the &quot;extras&quot; delivered in abundance on the disc.  Come on, Fox, you could at least have stuck a trailer on there or something - or how about the mini-documentary from the original 1990 release, for those who STILL don't know what it's all about?<br />But no matter - the real excitement here is the music.  Fox was wisely gone back to the original master tapes and re-mixed the entire soundtrack from scratch, in glorious THX stereo.  I hope I will not be accused of exaggeration when I state that &quot;Rocky&quot; has never sounded as good as it does now.  Not even the CD sounds this wonderful.  &quot;Frankenstein Place&quot; is ghostly and majestic, &quot;Time Warp&quot; is stunningly loud, and &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot; has re-gained the sleazy honky-tonk piano lost in the original stereo conversion.  But wait, there's more - the guitar parts have been mixed forward, giving a wonderfully crunchy texture to &quot;Hot Patootie&quot; and &quot;Floor Show.&quot;  Even the much-neglected &quot;Planet Hot Dog&quot; reveals funky organ riffs previously lost in the mix.  And, wonder of wonders, the little-seen &quot;Superheroes&quot; number has been re-instated at the end.<br />On the whole, the picture and sound quality of this new &quot;RockyHorror&quot; video puts the previous releases, even the widescreen edition, to shame.  As a fan this is the version I would want a casual viewer to experience.  Highly recommended!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I liked the film because it gave a particular viewpoint of the book.   I also very much enjoyed the book and most of the time, I don't enjoy the movie version of books I enjoy.   This was the exception.   Good Job.
0684853523|5.0|This book is terrific! If you're a fan of King's, you'll be fascinated by his stories of his life and its effect on his writing. If you are a writer, or want to be, BUY THIS BOOK. It's like taking a private class with a master writer. Incredible! I'm a published writer and felt like I learned many useful tricks and tools. This book made me want to go back and read all of King's books with a fresh eye for language and writing style. Highly recommended!
080018789X|5.0|Cuba Gooding, Jr, and Tom Cruise are incredible actors.  It's unfortunate that they're only a small part of the power this movie has to offer.<br />I actually bought the video without seeing it because I had purchased some audio books on leadership... one of them had been done by the gentleman this story was based on.  Hearing him speak of his trials and final triumph, his ethics and morals overpowering his need for dollars...  truly inspiring movie.<br />Once I had seen the movie, I was overjoyed that I had bought it.<br />A message here, for all.  Children and adults can benefit from the lessons offered within these celluloid walls.<br />A definite 5, and another must buy for your collection of movies that have actual meaning and substance.  I love this movie.
0553573403|1.0|This is a remarkably boring book I found unable to finish although I plowed through 405 pages.  Far too many characters ignore what is obvious to everyone around them.  Far too many people wander off in an obviously dangerous place to, gasp, get caught! Far too many adults are simply stupid. Zero stars for one of 3 books I could not bear to read any more.

0783242808|4.0|There's a ton of movies out there about guys and gals losing their virginity (ala Porkies, Losin' It, etc...).  They're a little funny, but pretty much just raunchy.<br />This movie, on the other hand, actually shows you that part of male sexuality that most other movies don't deal with...<br />I mean, the opening scene is a teen getting caught by his parents while watching scrambled porn (desperate, eh?) and in the middle of, well, you know...  the naivete of his mother, being nearly convinced it's a 'Nature Show', and his father catching on... &quot;Well... what are you hiding under there?&quot;  Hmmm...  he's in deep doody, fer sure...  well, okay, so it was a sock, but still...  And what's with the pie?<br />The awkwardness about male parental units discussing sexuality with the male children units, well, it's hysterical.<br />Slums of Beverly Hills kinda humor, but funny, entertaining, and worth watching a second time.<br />Whether you've got gals or guys as children, if you watch this with them, be prepped to explain a bunch...<br />Lots of quotables in here...  &quot;This one time, at band camp...&quot;  Well, it's one I hear over and over and whenever the kids say it, it makes me laugh.<br />Actually worth owning.  Worth the price.  Get it.
0440180295|1.0|I would describe this as the worst book of Vonnegut's career.<br />Want a coherent plot?  this is not the book for you. Characters whose actions make a degree of sense?  Nope. Excellent examples of Vonnegut's biting wit?  Not really.<br />Seeing a trend?<br />Slaughterhouse 5, while almost univerally hailed as Vonnegut's best work, is utterly bad.  I do not know if Vonnegut was attempting to be an absurdist (if so, he didn't succeed) or whether it was merely a cathartic exercise for taking away his pain from the horrific events he witnessed in the Second World War.  Whatever the excuse, it was not ever and is not now a good book.<br />When I first read this book, I stopped reading Vonnegut for well over a year.  I could hardly believe that the man who created such well crafted short fiction as &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; and such witty novels as Slapstick could do something this incredibly without redeeming value.  Its protagonist is an anti-hero of the first rate, yet the reader is expected to sympathize with him.  If Billy Pilgrim was intended as another alter-ego of Vonnegut himself, I do not think I would ever want to meet the writer in person, as he would be a let down to his own other works.
0380730367|5.0|I read this book by Dennis Lehane first.  After reading it I immediately when to Amazon and ordered all the others at once.  Dennis Lehane has created characters that are so believable and stories that are so engrossing that I read each book in a day.  My husband couldn't stand my talking about Patrick Angie and Bubba as though they were friends, even Bubba is sometimes a pussycat,(I have never done this with characters before) so he began to read these books and became as engrossed as I was.  We hope Dennis has another book out soon the  man is a wonderful writer.  We love these characters and hope he can keep thinking up more stories involving them.
0811826848|5.0|If you grew up alongside the Mersey while these four great kids from Liverpool were setting new standards in the art of music you won't want to miss the chance to get their perspective on those magical years.

B00004R99M|4.0|Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are totally awesome.  The singing is great...  You and your kids will be humming the tunes for ages and the kids will definitely want to see this one over and over.<br />Absolutely worth owning.
B000007NYS|5.0|Is it country?  Is it blues?  Is it folk, or maybe rock?  No, y'all, it's lucinda williams, perhaps one of the most innovative artist that modern music has to offer.  Considered her &quot;masterpiece&quot; (of course, &quot;car wheels. . .&quot; is equally good), this album captures everything that ms. williams may have to offer and throws it in your face.  though many label her as country, she has appeal for all genres.  her voice, neither opera nor church choir material, is perhaps one of the most convincing musical instruments anyone has ever produced.  each song, written by her, is sung perfectly. in &quot;crescent city&quot; (one of my favorites) you feel her longingness, but then her happiness to here her recount her past.  <br />all these songs are great.  i can't guarantee that the customer will like the last five or so songs, however, i definitely find it hard to believe anyone disliking the first eleven or so (which made up the original album).  so please, for your own sake, buy this album.
B00004X01U|5.0|All right, maybe that's an exaggeration, but the industry in the last twenty years wouldn't be as good without Madonna.  Once again she sheds off the past and moves forward with her 'Music'.  She does manage to keep Willy Orbit around for two tracks, but she implemets the use of little known French producer, Mirwais. I admit, there are some things lacking 'Music' from 'Ray of Light', but then there are songs on Music that could beat out half the ROL album.  I'm glad she didn't make a ROL part 2 album.  Here's my review of the standout songs:<br />MUSIC- short, simple, fun, it puts &quot;Vogue&quot; to shame.  The synthesizers and vocoded robot are cheezy but works wonders in this party anthem.  Madonna has a fun time singing this little ditty, she feels the rhythm of the music as she sings.  And let's face it, she's the only one who can pull off lines like:  &quot;Do you like to boogie-woogie&quot;.   - 9.5/10<br />IMPRESSIVE INSTANT- another short, but rather complicated dance track.  Madonna's vocals are intentionally distorted by the production.  For a few moments she sings normally, then the next she sings like that Europop group &quot;Aqua&quot;.  This is a very weird track that you want to listen to it more and more.   - 9/10<br />RUNAWAY LOVER-  Reminds me of Cher's &quot;Strong Enough&quot;, but not as cheezy.  This is another good club track where Madonna actually sings pretty well.  Lotsa heavy bass on here.   - 9/10<br />AMAZING- This Orbit track takes the sessions of &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; even further.  Losta heavy guitar and drums, and Madonna sounds better on here than she did on Beautiful Stranger.    - 9/10<br />I DESERVE IT-  Madonna intentionally uses the vocoder (or whatever it's called)  throughout the folk electronica track.  While Cher used it &quot;Believe&quot;, Madonna takes it much further.  Otherwise, this is a beautifully cold, emotional ballad.   - 9/10<br />DON'T TELL ME-  Makes a great second single.  It encompasses folk, electronica, pop, and R&amp;B.  It's a really fun dance song.  The best parts are when Madonna sings without the music, she really puts her soul into this track.    - 9/10<br />WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL-  Lyrically the best on the album.  The production is more mid-tempo, the best thing about it is the song itself.  Words from a woman who's been through it all, and lives to tell about it.          - 8.5/10<br />GONE-  Madonna goes Sheryl Crow, almost.  Wonderfully short (maybe too short) ending to this album.  The only things present are a guitar, light drums, and little production work done by Orbit and Stent.  Madonna's voice is dry and cold again, but truthful in her meaning.      - 9.5/10
B00004XONN|5.0|If this is too intellectual for you, you just missed the whole point. One customer said &quot;Aren't we tired of angst-art rock yet?&quot;, where my question would be, aren't you tired of the same old slop? Sure there aren't any radio songs, but if that's what you're looking for, wouldn't you have been better off listening to aerosmith in the first place? It seems quite ambitious to me for radiohead to release this album, but definitely a good move. I will be interested to see how many of their fans follow them down this road. As for me, I was not a HUGE fan of OK Computer, and anything earlier than that to me is not all that standout... but this album blew me away from the first listen, and has done so even more in subsequent listens. &quot;the national anthem&quot;, &quot;treefingers&quot;, &quot;idioteque&quot;... hell, they're all great. I don't know what else to say, except this is a wonderful, if mysterious, artistic statement.
079213690X|5.0|Bads:  I've seen my share of documentaries, for sure...<br />This seems more of a dramatization of the legend of William Wallace than a documentary which is actually a good thing...  but still, it's a bit long for some people to watch without a real intermission, which loses the cadence just a bit.<br />Greats:  The music, the lands, the atmosphere, just totally incredible.  Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Catherine McCormack, Patrick McGoohan.  All totally awesome and talented individuals.  The portrayals in this story of the betrayal, the death, the life, the hope, the loves... of this legendary Scottish man are incredible.<br />The funeral scene where the little girl gives the little William a thistle can move some to tears...  but when Wallace produces it many years later to show to his one true love how he feels...  it makes you dream of a love such as this.<br />The love of his life, taken from him, his vengeance, and his falling in love again and his being loved...  incredibly moving.<br />His loyalty, faith and trust in another man, and the betrayal that ultimately leads to his downfall.  For one man to wish to serve another (or his country or his fellow man) so is inspiring in this age of corporate turnovers.<br />Truly powerful.  Even if it's not totally based on truth, I just don't care.  It's worth owning and watching again and again.<br />The victors really do write the history.  Maybe it's not so much of a legend after all.<br />There's a little too much gore for some younger viewers, but overall not bad.<br />A date movie, a prize to own.  Get it.
0441003257|5.0|You're a sap if you don't love this book.  ;-)  It's the only comedy that I've had to stop reading so I could recover from the extreme fits of laughter I incurred.  Mr. Gaiman and Mr. Pratchett are both gifted writers, and I'm glad that they got together to create this little treasure.  Get one for yourself and several more for all your friends and family!
0375703764|5.0|Incredibly scary! I was sceptical about how scary the subject would be, but I was proven wrong. My whole office has passed this book around and it has been a great source of entertainment. I enjoy the many stories being told at once. The feeling that you get when you read about the demensions of the house it is just incredibly unsettling. It almost makes you want to go over and measure your own closets and such. The author brings you into the story, and you begin to question if the the book was written to you.
6305949980|5.0|This is the best movie ofd be  all time, what more could be said!
B00003CXCS|5.0|Words cannot do justice to this movie.  I have watched it on VHS, but the DVD is so much superior.  We also enjoyed the 2nd disk with the background info about the actors, actresses, production, etc.  This DVD is easily worth every penny.  You'll be glad you own it.
6305558167|4.0|This film has some flaws. Its too short. It should have been a trilogy. Some of the lines are cheesy and not all of the actors were chosen well. It works best for those who know the legend. On the other hand the  music is great,visuals are sumptuous and fortunately  its not watered down for the Disney-loving kiddies.
0553213105|5.0|It is a common tragedy that many high-schoolers and even adults do not read old books because they believe the books are not relevant. My words for them: human nature has not changed one bit since Jane Austen crafted her magic. Many people begin their reviews with &quot;Once you get past . . .&quot; but if any element were left out of this book (victorian society, language, high formality) it would diminish the book. Austen has shown through her characters the importance of valuing a person for who they truly are while 1) making fun of prudish victorian standards 2) showing gossip for the destructor it is, and 3) being one of the first writers to promote free thinking women as opposed to silly girls. Pride and Prejudice is called a classic for a reason: it will always remain a literary treasure.
0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner is a true scifi classic. Having recently seen it on DVD, I was suprised to see that the visuals easily live up to the standard that we have today.  A very moody film. Well written. If you want non-stop action, you should pass this one though. Its kinda slow moving .Note, that the rating is for the film, not the DVD. A film like this deserves lots of extras with it,but by the looks of it, the publisher just wanted to make a big buck. They didnt even bother to put a proper picture  in the menu screen!
B00002Z88D|3.0|Whoaw, when I first heard this album I was very surprised of the great performance of Metallica and the Symphony! I heard the whole album over and over, but now after some months, I feel dissapointed.  Sure, the arrangement of the classics Nothing Else Matters and especially Call Of Ktulu are great, so is Master of Puppets the new song No Leaf Clover and the awesome For Whom The Bell Tolls (shame the lack of the Bells themselves), and One is now more freightning in the beginning, coz of those scary strings, that also makes the song more sad than it already was. <br />But all the other songs aren't as good as the ones I just named. Okay, Battery and Enter Sandman can be accepted in a Classic\Live album, but that's it with great arrangement and good Metallica songs. I mean, that second new song Minus Human is just above average, and then it's over with the classic songs from Metallica.  Most of the other songs are picked from the Load and Reload albums , albums that most of the Metallica-before-Load fans don't like.<br />And why didn't they put instead of those songs others Classics like: the Unforgiven (I really can't understand why they did forgot that song, It's my favourite song!) or the second one!!, Orion and To Live Is To Die (those are long songs yes, but will ,according to me, sound terrific with the Orchestra), Harvester of Sorrow, ...And Justice for All, Fade To Black, Welcome Home Sanitarium (another song that is mysteriously forgotten).  The reason I give this album 3 stars is because it's a good album, it only could be all that better. Even if there are some nice touches in the songs of this album: the RIP riff in the end of The Thing That Should Not Be and the Sportcars sound in the next song: Fuel, and of course that war sphere in One.<br />What Metallica now can do to make things right is making an in studio-recording 'Acoustic album'. That can be beatifull Classic sounding with an orchestra (ever heard Nothing Else Matters with the London Symphony?)<br />If you are like me dissapointed and really would like to have a really Classic sound of the Metallica songs, then I recommend you buying the two Apocalyptica albums. After hearring those  you'd wish that Michael Kamen would arrange as good as Apocalyptica does.  And Michael can do that, remember him playin' together with Queen playing the song Who Wants to Live Forever?   <br />Remember: the songs of this album all are good, most of them, though, is not Metallica music anymore. So buy it if you're a Rock fan, but mind it if you're a Metal(lica) fan.
0345350499|5.0|My sister recomended this book to me, and  being a great fan of fantasy, I gave it a  try. it was an enchanting experience. You can see that its  made for women though, but the sometimes sappy content was forgotten thanks  to the suprisingly realistic characters and  interesting drama. I was lost in its deep embrace for days. It made me see Gwenhwyfar in a different light too ( a disgusting woman).
0679746048|5.0|I related deeply to all the characters in the movie, which I saw several times before reading the book. Like most people interested in this material, I have (and still do) feel &quot;crazy&quot; and ostracized from &quot;normal&quot; society. I read the book in one afternoon and was struck by Susanna Kaysen's penetrating and brutally honest descriptions of both her own mind and those of the lonely, damaged girls she shared 2 years with. Susanna was in some sense lucky to have come from a well-monied family. Many people much like her suffer doing battle with invisible dragons in obscurity, unknown and forgotten, unable to contribute to the healing of our society in any meaningful way, and in many cases only because of their lesser economic status. Then again, money might have nothing to do with whether or not a damaged person can emerge from his or her own personal hell to aid others in overcoming their own. (???)<br />The book is non-linear and switches between chapters describing Susanna's  day to day existence and relationships at McLean Hospital in Belmont, MA. and more reflective, analytical chapters like the one in which she explictly elaborates for the reader two &quot;modes&quot; of &quot;insanity&quot;, the lethargic/catatonic and the manic, the distictions between the two being invisible to the uninitiated observer (i.e. the staff at McLean). Ms. Kaysen has a very engaging writing style and I plan to read her other books as well.
B00004X01U|2.0|I was really looking forward to a new M cd.. Especially since it was supposed to be a return to her &quot;dance&quot; roots, etc. Unfortunately the album really lacks after about the 2nd to 3rd track. And although you can really hear W.Orbit's contribution (a good thing), M's vocals are waaay to high in the mix. I really liked Ray of Light (4.75 of 5) [and erotica] and was hoping that this cd would musically be in that direction again. It totally fails. I kept hearing that this would be a return to her dance roots, etc. I simply didn't hear it.<br />In summary: Save your money; sadly, the CD is a total letdown.
B00000AFDW|5.0|kiss has always been the mainstay of my cd collection. when i see a new kiss album, i go thru hell or high water to get it. kiss has influenced many of today's HARD ROCKERS(alternaivetive and boy bands can kiss my rear) and it is a shame to see that they are saying good bye to the hard rock arena. this album is a landmark for them.
B00004XONN|5.0|Nothing to do with Creep or The Bends... nothing to do with OK Computer... nothing to do with anything... Admittedly, I felt a bit shocked when I listened to this album the first time, but then I realized Radiohead is a band with no fear of creating new things or setting people amazed. This is not exception. It's very good to feel shocked by this!!! Kid A is quietly, calm (&quot;Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream...&quot;), challenging, astounding, but, most important of all, it's more than a bunch of songs, it's SONIC ART (in capital letters, it's really true!!!)<br />Don't be bothered by the lack of choruses, riffs or other things to ease song identification, just sit down and listen to all the musical landscapes they crafted. Listen to the weird arrangements in &quot;Kid A&quot; or &quot;Treefingers&quot;, the sheer beautifulness of &quot;How To Dissapear Completely&quot; or &quot;Optimistic&quot;, the almost-techno sound of &quot;Idioteque&quot;, the orchestral parts in &quot;National Anthem&quot; or &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;... this album has so much to offer...<br />These five guys did it again, sure, Kid A is the first trend-setting and groundbreaking album of the century, and you can consider Radiohead one on the best bands of all time.<br />They did it again, so get Kid A right NOW!!!
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is a masterful transfer of a classic piece of musical cinema.  The songs sound wonderful including the never released Once in Awhile.  The film looks fabulous and it certainly doesn't look 25 years old.  Just an exceptional film turned into a truly remarkable DVD with loads and loads of extras.  Get it this is something you need to own.
B000023X9W|5.0|Try to imagine yourself as a youngster growing up in a small town in Ontario. At the age of 5, or thereabouts, you develop polio. At the age of 13, or thereabouts, your father leaves your mom for another woman, and the full pursuit of his career. Your older brother goes off with his dad and you stay with your mom. Your forced to move into a smaller place with the memories your dad left behind. Your new high school doesn't inspire you. All you care about is your music, and at the young age of 19 you decide you can't have your cake and eat it to where you are, so it's time to really begin thinking seriously about moving on. You have to leave to live out your lifes true passion to the fullest. &quot;Sugar mountain&quot; reflects the past, as well as the future, and you move on. You experience the NYC thing of the sixties and realize your possibilities. You meet up with an artist who shares a similar passion. You realize his commitment is equal to your own. So you hop in your hearst (long may she run); that makes you happy. Suddenly, by chance, your recording with this individual, (and two other significant artists) and signing major recording contracts in LA. Your famous! Shortly thereafter, you develop epilepsy. Eventually, you marry, have a son striken with a rare dissability. It happens again to you in your third marraige, to your second son. Your wife develops a brain tumor, is hospitalized, and recovers. Your mom (Rassy) passes.(She bought you your first guitar)   You endure it all somehow, and every note you write reflects your feelings. Now, you live for your children; for your wife, and helping others(THE BRIDGE SCHOOL). Still trying to make sense of it all, but knowing that what really matters it what we leave behind. This is the passion of Neil Young. The passion behind Silver and Gold. All I can say after growing up with this guy for thirty years is, Man, can he play that thing; and their's no one that can hit that acoustic guitar like Neiler. Thank you Neil. You are my inspiration. There is no one that plays that thing from the heart like you do.
B000000WA4|5.0|I could go on and on and on and write a book about this album, but since we only have 1,000 wordz here.... This album is for anyone and everyone...the quintessential album that is just timeless.  I'm a new Pumpkins fan (unfortunately they are breaking up soon) and this is the centerpiece of what drew me in.  I remember 5 years ago when the lead singer uttered &quot;The world is a vampire&quot; (from the awesome BULLET WITH BUTTERFLY WINGS track), and life has never been the same again...that song sends chills down my spine and it is the centerpiece of this album.  All the tracks have a great flow to their story, and all the tracks are so varied that one can listen to any part of this depending on their mood.  To this very day I am still finding new stuff that I like about this album; there are songs that didn't excite me at first, but as I grew into the album, I've picked up on the tracks to now be able to say that there is not a bad track on here...no filler at all.  Everything is quintessential to what makes the album so great.  The Smashing Pumpkins should moniker this album as &quot;The Smashing Success&quot;!  If you don't own it now, grab it now!  You won't regret the purchase.
B00004XONN|3.0|Radiohead is by far my favorite band.  I say this based on The Bends, OK Computer, and to a lesser extent Pablo Honey.  However, unlike other people who claim alligence to a certain band, I refuse to lie about the newest album when it isn't up to par.  If Kid A were the first album by Radiohead, and the classic pillars mentioned above didn't exist, you would give this album about 10 minutes and then flip it into the trash.<br />Maybe I feel this way because I was SO excited for Kid A's release.  I built it up in my mind a lot, but I expected Radiohead to surpass my expectations again.  They didn't.  I don't know what is going on with this album.  There are a few good parts, and the recording is impeccable.  This album might be good for audiophiles who have fifty thousand dollar stereos.<br />The thing that most scares me is that I heard Radiohead started another album concurrently with this one.  My friend and I were joking that we hope they aren't going to front-load Kid A with all the good stuff and leave the crap for the newer one.  &quot;Perish the thought!  Radiohead wouldn't do that!&quot;  It's ironic when I think about that conversation in the context of Kid A.  If the good stuff is on there, what could they possibly put on the other one?  An hour of the band snoring?<br />Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe after listening to this album multiple  times (which I will, because they are Radiohead) I will learn to like it.  For those reasons I give Kid A three stars.
B00000AFWW|4.0|Celebrity Skin is more subdued, less raw than Live Through This. A different album, a different sound. Courtney screaming is not the centerpiece of the album, but this albums reflects a new maturity in songwriting which most fans will recognize, and if not appreciate at least respect. I enjoyed this album and its more melodic qualities. \\"Celebrity Skin\\", \\"Awful\\", \\"Hit So Hard\\", \\"Malibu\\", \\"Reasons to be Beautiful\\", \\"Northern Star\\" and \\"Heaven Tonight\\" are my favourites. Yeah, I know, it is a bit excessive to have such a long list of favourites, but this is how Holes albums are for me. Full of great songs. Hard to choose among the powerful and crisp songs for a favourite. I am sure if you give this album a chance you will feel similarly.
0811826848|5.0|As a long-time Beatle book collector, I can honestly report that this book is gorgeous &amp; the concept fairly well-executed.  Some of the photos were so amazingly personal &amp; unusual-- since purchasing The Beatles Anthology, I have repeatedly enjoyed looking at the interesting candids from the Beatles' own private collections.  As far as personal revelations from the group, there were not many surprises (especially if you have already viewed the Anthology video).  Also, in my opinion, there was not enough emphasis on the actual recording &amp; songwriting.<br />However, there were plenty of fun anecdotes about their early years on the road (complete with stories of Beatle drug experimentation) &amp; how everything changed for them with the onset of enormous fame.  It was expecially touching to read about the respect &amp; affection the group felt for each other in the early years.<br />Overall, the stories were nice, but buy this one for the photos!  It should make a fine addition to your own Beatle book collection and/or your coffee table.
B000002H8F|4.0|A friend gave me this stunning album as a Christmas gift... from the opening instrumental track to the very end, I was riveted by this album. Already a fan of the Pixies, the brilliance of this album was no big surprise... as usual there are some strong guitar parts, some wacky lyrics (wacky but so lovable and original), and the vocals, once more, of Black Francis... Although this is one of those albums best heard as a whole, there are some outstanding songs here, which include \\"Velouria\\" (\\"Hold my head, well trampoline...\\"), \\"Is She Weird?\\", the melodic track six, and \\"Dig for Fire\\". This is the last album made with Kim Deal's involvement (before she left to pursue the Breeders full time), and her contribution is sorely missed in the next album, although it too is a treat.
B00004XONN|5.0|I was very curious as to what turn Radiohead would take after the pinnacle of their musical journey that was (or is) O.K. Computer. It appears they have added another interesting pattern to their musical mosaic of albums. The world &quot;brilliant&quot; is often a hackneyed term when it comes to popular music, but I feel the term can be aptly applied to Radiohead.        With that being said, this album only capitalizes on the statement. And although it is brilliant, don't expect too many comparisons between this album and O.K. Computer. Radiohead seems to be delving a bit more into the electronica genre, with trip hop &quot;beats&quot; and tr-303 fuzziness. Guitars and the typical rock band format are used sparsely. This seems to be an unlikely yet perfect progression as Radiohead's newest addition to their category of albums.
B000001E7T|4.0|Starts with darkness, ends with urgency. Another stellar effort from PJ Harvey. I did not immediately fall in love with this album as I had with previous PJ albums, but upon listening to it and involving myself in new sounds here... I did eventually come to love everything on this record. <br />&quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; is a slow, lamenting sort of song... followed by a harder &quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot; (&quot;Big, black monsoon, take me with you...&quot;), with some more traditional sounding songs like &quot;C´mon Billy&quot;, &quot;Send His Love to Me&quot; and &quot;The Dancer&quot;... and the infinitely listenable &quot;Down by the Water&quot;. <br />Definitely worth your time and money...
B000002J0G|3.0|Ha,ha, Does Anyone Know That Urotsukidoji is A Japanese Animated Film filled with violence and other naughty stuff? I just happened to noticed this song and get this album. The Song Even has a scene from the movie at the beginning in the background. (plus japanese  voices in the background) A Decent album I guess.
B0000087QO|4.0|I received this album (on vinyl) along with Blondie's Autoamerican for my fifth birthday. Apparently at my request. I don't remember asking for Blondie records, but it is perfectly possible that I did. So I was reared on this musical diet, and I think my musical taste is better for it. I also think my mother was incredibly wise to let me listen to whatever music my young whim demanded. Many years later, I am still in love with these Blondie albums, although I have replaced them on CD (I don't have a turntable anymore, unfortunately!) For the time, Blondie was something new, sexy, and cutting edge. I still cannot help falling in love with it over again when I hear it.  Deborah Harry's sexy and convincing vocals were quite the attraction, and songs like the very sweet \\"Sunday Girl\\" and \\"Picture This\\" were always lovely. The songs on Parallel Lines are all wonderful songs, while some of them are among Blondies most famous, like \\"Heart of Glass\\" which was a huge hit. When I was younger I did not know the difference between hit and non-hit, so I always listened to this album all the way through, and I have never regretted that because every song here is original and fresh. No chronicle of the late 70s and early 80s is complete without having some of this good stuff on it.
B00004XQP4|5.0|After the greatness that was &quot;Nimrod&quot;, I was really worried about &quot;Warning&quot;.  With 3 years worth of rumors that the band had ditched its punk roots for more of a pop melody, it really made me sweat. Well, after standing in a line of over 350 people at a local cd shop on the night of release, my worries turned to sighs of relief. &quot;Warning&quot; is the perfect follow up to &quot;Nimrod&quot;, taking what they started on that album, and going the extra step further.  I call it &quot;changing without changing&quot;, while slowing the pace down a bit with great songs like &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot;, and keeping the punk flair with tracks like &quot;Blood, Sex and Booze&quot; a song about a dominatrix, and &quot;Minority&quot;.  This album is more lyrically positive, which is what I see as the biggest change.  The last track of the album &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;, the ballad and great closing to a great disc, has a great melody and lyrics that make you think.  Id say Billie Joe and the guys pulled off another great one, but I really dont know how they can top this one.....
B000002H72|5.0|If the late 1980s had some really contrived, horrendous garbage some people called music, there were certainly the alternatives who displayed scorching guitars, interesting and unexpected arrangements, clever lyrics, and great albums. One band who exemplified this alternative was the Pixies, disbanding in the early 90s creating their own side projects, but not before creating a few brilliant records, Doolittle being the most brilliant of them all. The vocals of Black Francis coupled with the softer and distinctive voice of Kim Deal was purely delightful, with some truly exceptional and memorable songs like \\"Debaser\\", \\"Wave of Mutilation\\", \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" (which is quite melodic!), \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven\\" and several other remarkable songs. This is a solid, superb album which any serious music lover must have. It is a little unconventional and might take some getting used to, but it is infinitely worth it.
B000001EAQ|4.0|One day, U2 will write a bad song. However after listening to this, and their newer stuff (The Ground Beneath Her Feet &amp; Beautiful Day) I am convinced that day is a long long way away.<br />Anyways, this might be a &quot;safer&quot; album than Zooropa, but by no means is it less enjoyable. Bono's voice in some of these ballads (in particular Please) moves me as much as any Radiohead vocals. Discotheque is just plain cool, and Staring At The Sun is a rock classic!!!!!!! <br />U2 are a very special rock band
B000001DYD|5.0|Throughout this volcanic production you will hear moments of near-silence, while Polly Jean whispers so innocently, and suddenly, you will be subjected to a blast of ferocious, angry sound the likes of which you may have never heard... and despite this unbalanced sort of sound, it is absolutely necessary and is the sharp edge of Polly Jean's creative sword. Need I say that this album takes the  sheerly beautiful elements of the debut album Dry, pastes them into this patchwork of noise, frightful lyrics and imagery... and comes up with this work of art. <br />I somehow always forget how much I love PJ Harvey and respect the musicianship and the ability and willingness to take musical risks. Every song here is worthy of discussion, but I can say my favourites here are relatively disturbing: &quot;Rid of Me&quot;, &quot;Missed&quot;, &quot;Legs&quot;, the cruel and unusual &quot;Rub Til It Bleeds&quot;, the different versions of &quot;Man Size&quot;, and &quot;Dry&quot;. <br />Sometimes this album verges on the psychotic. But you won't mind.
0811826848|5.0|Imagine having lived through the most intense decade in recent history, being witness to the major cultural and political changes of that time. The Beatles have published their scrapbook of these times, the 1960's. <br />This book is big. Literally. Almost 400 pages long, thick, my first impresssion was how well the text (mostly transcripts from the Anthology series and from Lennon's interviews) and the photos flow together to create a true journal of the Fab Four.  The book's design captures the dyamicism of  The Beatles.  Don't expect a stuffy, art gallery volume of tastfully placed photos; this book gives you the feel of the events and phases of The Beatle's career .<br />This is not a book for fact freaks. Don't expect lists, charts, trivia questions or day to day events.  This is a personal tale. Unlike most other Beatles books, it does not list every city they toured, how many times they recorded a song, or even what percentage of what song John or Paul wrote. That's not needed nor missed in this book.<br />There are the juicy parts, especially when they talk about Hamburg's red light district, but its treater more matter of fact than  anything else.  I've read most of the Beatles bios but Anthology, unblemished by a writer's interpretation, makes a lot of the history seem fresh.<br />Most of the photographs, it seems, have never been published; and there are some striking image collages. One to is the Shea Stadium concert  images, some of which seemed to have been pulled from the concert's movie film frames.<br />When you tell the story of the greatest band ever, your job is not easy, but clear: let them tell it in their own words and pictures. This book is The Beatles. Their charm and freshness were as much a reason they took over the world as was their music. Beatles fan? Yes, get this book. Get it anyway. Like many of what the Beatles touched, it's already the gold standard for its field. Highly recommended.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana's last album was at once loud, noisy, uncompromising, and beautiful. I was never a huge fan of Nirvana. Sure I had their albums, sure Id seen them live in the early days before Nevermind came out. I think most people in Seattle had (well, any who had interest in music). They had a clever approach, a new voice and solid songs. From In Utero it is clear that their music and songwriting abilities were maturing, and this album was a stellar achievement. It is never clear if a band will live up to the promise of their \\"breakthrough\\" album. Nirvana surpassed it. \\"Serve the Servants\\" is an incredible song, \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" (released as a single) is full of gorgeous imagery (Kurt Cobain seemed to fine tune his lyrics and imagery in this record), \\"Rape Me\\" is full of contradictions, \\"Rape me, rape me, my friend; Rape me, rape me...again\\"... My favourite song on the album is \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", which has a slightly cautionary and sad tone to it (for me). \\"All Apologies\\" is also a favourite again with some exceptionally stunning imagery and beautiful construction. (Sinad O'Connor does a lovely remake of the song on her Universal Mother album). Overall this album is constructed well, and I, despite not liking the noisiest incarnations of Nirvana, do not skip any songs here. It was a truly, I feel, groundbreaking album, surpassing Nevermind with its genius, despite not reaching the frenzied sales and hitting a nerve with the public in the same fashion. It is, as most people agree, a shame that this is the last album from Nirvana, but it is more of a reason to cherish it.
B00004XONN|5.0|The magic of this album comes out after a couple of spins, so don't be put off at first.  Like OK Computer, and less like The Bends (their best album) and Pablo Honey, they've done their best to avoid any radio single-type pop.  It's more of a &quot;concept&quot; album.  <br />&quot;Optimistic&quot; is the one exception, a fast, groovy tune that has you tapping your feet.  Lots of good ambience on this album, put it in your car as you nudge your way through traffic.
B000001FI7|5.0|Atmospheric, mysterious... heavy bass, soaring, melancholy vocals. A gorgeous production of a most downcast nature. I fell in love with this album at once after a friend recorded it for me. I immediately went out to buy the CD. Not a single song here that is ill-advised or otherwise misplaced. Gorgeous, lush, and the vocals are to die for. Track one is sheer pleasure; track two picks up the pace a bit with the at least modestly well known \\"Sour Times\\" and its familiar refrain, \\"Nobody loves me... its true... not like you do.\\" Track five is another of my favourites. Track six \\"Its a Fire\\" is my favourite track on the entire album... very well placed and also rather melancholy song, \\"This life is a farce. I cant breathe through this mask. Like a fool. So breathe on, little sister, breathe on...\\" Other not-to-be missed tracks include tracks seven, eight, and especially eleven. The vocals are lush, seductive, and absolutely chilling.
B00001R3GC|5.0|Sticky Fingers was the first release on the band's own Rolling Stone label and what a release it was.  &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; was the first number one song about interracial romance and sounds like it could have been released by Stax/Volt.  &quot;Sway&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; slow things down after the roaring start and then next up is one of their most overlooked songs &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot;.  Starting off with a strong guitar riff, the song eventually dissolves into a searing sax solo that ends the song.  &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; is a twisted country song while &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; is a haunting tale of drug addiction. The granduer of &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; closes out the album.  The album is not only notible for its great music, but for its Andy Warhol designed cover.  The original album had an actual zipper and as an extra treat, this limited edition copy also contains the controversial pants part.
B000002MY3|4.0|This album is not inherently bad. It captured the public's attention at the right time, and as they say timing is everything. I personally do not enjoy Morissette's vocal style; some of her observations are clever, witty, and timely. They might even provoke thought. It seems a bit too contrived, reaching for soem depth. It doesn't help my perception that this album (particularly the raw &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;) has been overplayed... and overplayed again. I am not hateful and spiteful about this. I simply wanted some respite. <br />However, this was not to be. Friends caught onto this Alanis-fever and fell in love with this feminist anthem (the aforementioned &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;) and tried to drag me into it with them. I will admit that the song (and album) are both very catchy. Lyrics are cleverly crafted...and almost every person alive can relate to these lyrics. Despite Alanis taking herself a bit too seriously, I was eventually impressed by the ferocity of this album... contemplative at the same time as angry. (Reminding me of a poem by Robert Lowell which ends &quot;Fear made wise by anger...&quot; for some reason...) This record can be downright inspiring to the jealous or the jilted, the fragile and the hurt... and Alanis has put all those feelings into the right words at the right time. And even know, years after the phenomenon ended... I am still struck by the avenging urge whenever I hear &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;. And I am not really a fan.  Whatever the case, I think this was a landmark album for its timing... it came along at the perfect time and voiced what everyone else was feeling.
B00001R3GI|5.0|Exile On Main St. is a murky, muddy, brilliant album.  It sounds like it was recorded at four a.m. after spending a night curled up with a bottle of Jack Daniels or Jim Beam.  The band at the time was spiraling down into a pit of drug addiction and complete decadence and the album takes us into that world.  The way the album was recorded and produced give us the feeling of despair and dirtiness. The vocals are all down in the mix and it sounds like Mick &amp; Keith are singing underwater at times and other than the horns, the instruments are layered on top of one another with no distinction between them.  This doesn't take away from the performances, it only enhances them. The Stones have always been fascinated by and included elements from the music of the American Deep South.  Those influences show up all over the album.  From the gospel sound of what very well may be their greatest single &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, the Memphis horns on &quot;Rocks Off&quot; &amp; &quot;Happy&quot;, the Mississippi Delta blues of &quot;Torn &amp; Frayed&quot;, &quot;Turd On The Run&quot; &amp; &quot;Venilator Blues&quot;, the Alabama dirges of &quot;Loving Cup&quot;, &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, &amp; &quot;Shine A Light&quot; to the electric boogie of &quot;Rip This Joint&quot; &amp; &quot;All Down The Line&quot;, the band takes us on a musical tour-de-force.  This album is least commercial of any Stones release, but it may well be their best.
B00000AFFI|3.0|I expected so much more from PJ Harvey after the breathtaking offerings produced thus far, but this album seems myred in the same sort of groove as the last album. It was original and spectacular in the last album. Here it is just repetition. This album has no catchy songs, nothing that holds my interest or attention. Sad.
B000003BEM|5.0|Beggars Banquet was the last album released by the original Stones lineup, although Brian Jones is reported to have barely played on it.  It was a strong comeback by the band, who in trying to compete with the Beatles and fit in with the Psychadelic scene, had released the terribly misguided Their Satantic Majesties Request.  Beggars strips away all the musically gimmickry and provides the listener with bare-bones rock.  &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; has taken on a life of its own and has become the band's manifesto.  &quot;No Expectations&quot;, &quot;Dear Doctor&quot;, &quot;Prodical Son&quot; &amp; &quot;Factory Girl&quot; find the band exploring country music themes for the first time.  With their sexual themes, &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; &amp; &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; put the band in familiar territory.  The album closes with their anthem for the little man, the earnest &quot;Salt Of The Earth&quot;.  Beggars Banquet closes one era of the band while opening up a new one.  They say goodbye to Brian Jones and start a music path that would produce some of the greatest albums ever recorded in musical history.
B000003TSP|3.0|Another stunning Portishead album... the opening track is glorious, as is the second track. Overall Portishead knows how to put together a satisfying album which reaches the listener, entertaining and touching. There is an overall effect the album in its entirety creates, setting a mood. I do not love this album the way I loved the previous album, but I am particularly fond of \\"Mourning Air\\".
B000003BF4|5.0|The Rolling Stones tour of America in 1969 has become one of the most infamous and legendary of all time.  It of course concluded with the Altamont concert and was documented in the film Gimme Shelter.  Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out provides us with a live document of the tour from a Madison Square Garden show.  What makes this such a great live record is that is does what so few live albums do, it makes us we feel as if we're actually at the show.  From the opening introduction of the &quot;Greatest Band Of All Time&quot; to the closing chords of the militant &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, we get the vibe of what it must have been like to have been there.  While the performances, from a technical point of view, may not be the best of their career, that's beside the point.  The Stones have always been more about emotion than anything else and the performances of &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot;, &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;, &quot;Love In Vain&quot; &amp; &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; perfectly capture and convey all their raw emotion and intensity.  The Stones have made it a practice to release a live album after all their tours, but none are even close to this one.
B00004XONN|4.0|Much is being said of this 'new and innovative' music. Don't get me wrong - I think it's great. But its not that different to what Steven Wilson (in his various personas of Porcupine Tree, No-Man and Bass Communion) and other independent label British musicians have been producing for years.
0811826848|5.0|At this very moment, they have an album on the charts, a bestselling rental, and now a book written by them. . . 26 years after their breakup and 20 years after John's death.  Only the Beatles could pull off such a magnificent feat as all this. <br />Their new book The Beatles Anthology is nothing less than a work of art. A Sgt. Pepper for the printed world.  Who could expect less from the greatest band of all time? The imagery is stunning and it is incredible to think about the fact that you are reading the words of the Beatles themselves. For any devoted, maybe even a little obsessed, fan such as myself, this is the epitome of any collection. Maybe I should not even say that because they never cease to amaze me and just when you think they can do nothing else. . . the impossible comes true. <br />Maniac, fan, or just plain interested, you should read this book and I hope you cherish it as much as i will.
B00004XONN|5.0|OK Computer is, I believe, the greatest album since &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; Kid A is no OK Computer, but it is still absolutely brilliant. It is a bizarre album from a band which boasts 3 guitars, since there are very few guitars at all. Radiohead, as perhaps the most critically admired band in existence, has created an album which broadcasts their love of numerous &quot;underground&quot; artists- Aphex Twin, DJ Shadow, Autechre. This album is self-indulgent, but I appreciate that. I would rather people listen to Radiohead and move on to DJ Shadow than people listen to Korn and move on to Papa Roach. Politics aside, this is a gorgeous album which reinvents the parameters of &quot;rock,&quot; from the ecstatically elliptical opener &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; to the wailing free jazz of &quot;The National Anthem&quot; to the brilliant &quot;Idioteque,&quot; which proves that Thom Yorke is a musical genius as he takes a genre in which RH has never dabbled and makes a landmark song. Please buy this album.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm very appreciative of artists that take chances with their  music even though it may not be popular with the public who believe a recording must be good if it's played on the radio alot, or they have a flashy video.<br />I like this style of music.<br />This in my humble opinion is another excellent offering by Radiohead.  I have a subscription to RealNetworks GoldPass, and got a free sampling of the entire CD.  I've played it at least 5 times.<br />Kid A, I recommend it! I love it!  I'll buy it! ...from Amazon ofcourse.
B00004WKII|5.0|I have been a Hendrix Fan for a long time. And i have waited a long time for this BOX SET...I have to tell you..this BOX SET is simply unbelievable...Every song is very well recorded and all songs are just fantastic..I must say that &quot;Little Wing&quot; on Disc 3 is the best song in this BOX SET..It's magical..it's simply extraodinary..If i were you, i would buy the BOX SET just because of &quot;Little Wing&quot;...Other Songs that were great are &quot;Red House&quot; and &quot;Bold as Love&quot;...But overall, this BOX SET is a great masterpiece...It shows us what JIMi Hendrix was all about...he is the best Artist of the 20th century...so BUY THIS BOX SET..
B000001DYA|5.0|These guys had everything I wanted. The longest hair, the loudest guitars, Marshalls, a silver album cover and had fun making their music. This is raw unpretensious rock &amp; roll being played for the sheer joy of it. As I approach my half century mark I return to music like this to get back to where I belong. This is a piece that must be listened to at max loadness. Just like ZS&amp;TSFM. This one hurts real good.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Not since earlier classics like, Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf... have I seen a performance like that of Annette Benning in American Beauty.  Her neuroticism throughout the film is unparalled by any contemporary actor/actress.  The biggest suprise of the 1999 Academy Awards was that Benning did not win the best actress nod. Every aspect of this film carries the quality, visual impact, and emotional excellence of nearly every classic ever idolized by film gurus over the ages.  Kevin Spacey's performance was not only the apex of perfect... it was inspiring.  I am not allowed enough words to detail just how well Spacey made Lester Burnham incredibly believable.  &quot;I RULE!&quot; pretty sums up the film.
0811826848|5.0|All I can say is, Wow... I've been a Beatles fan for a long time, even though I'm only sixteen, and I'm very impressed with their new book!  I've been waiting for it to come out and I am certainly pleased!  I mean, who wouldn't be?  They talk about personal stories, either funny or embarrassing, and who could forget George's story about how he lost his virginity?  LoL.  Great book.  &quot;Fab&quot; as they would say! :)  All Beatle fans should get it -- no question.  I haven't finished reading it all (368 pages!!) so I'm going to do that now... Great book!!!
0140187537|4.0|This book reads like a howl of pain from a man who did not like where he saw his country headed.  Sadly, no one was listening.<br />Ethan Allen Hawley is a Harvard educated descendent of New England shipping captains.  In years  past, his family was one of the most important in town.  But now times have changed &amp; after his  father lost most of the family fortune &amp; Ethan himself lost the family store, he is reduced to being a  grocery clerk in the employ of an immigrant, Mr. Marullo.<br />Ethan's wife, Mary, and his two children, Ellen and Allen, push him to better the family's lot. Mary,  for instance, wants him to invest the $6000 she inherited upon her brother's death.<br />The town vixen, Margie Young-Hunt, provides a powerful pull to kick over the traces &amp; run a bit  wild.  She sends a representative from a food wholesaler to Ethan &amp; he is offered a kickback if he'll  buy from them.<br />Meanwhile, Danny Taylor, his childhood friend &amp; now the town drunk, holds a piece of property that  developers are desparate to get ahold of for their planned airport.  The local banker approaches Ethan  for help in getting the property away from Danny.<br />In short order Ethan is narcing on neighbors, betraying Danny, taking bribes &amp; planning to rob the  bank.<br />The ease with which the morally upright Ethan slips into a life of scheming and crime is not  particularly believable.  And I'll leave it to others to question the likelihood of a college graduate  turned grocery clerk (lawyer/technicians shouldn't throw stones.)<br />However, Steinbeck had clearly perceived the general decline in morality that was occuring and  accelerating as the nation entered the 1960's.  As Ethan considers his schemes, he says, &quot;A crime is  something someone else commits&quot;.  Here's his description of the year 1960: it was &quot;a year when secret  fears come into the open, when discontent stops being dormant and changes gradually to anger.  The  whole world stirred with restlessness and uneasiness as discontent moved to anger and anger tried to  find outlet in action, any action so long as it is violent.&quot;<br />Steinbeck manages to paint an extremely bleak portrait of America &amp; where it was headed, but it's  hard to argue that he was wrong.  He offers only two rays of hope.  At one point, Ethan recalls the  words of his grandfather, &quot;Only in a single man alone--only in one man alone.  There's the only  power--one man alone.  Can't depend on anything else.&quot;  This nearly biblical incantation offers the way out of the predicament that Steinbeck has forecast.  Each man must take responsibility for his  own actions.<br />Then when Ethan has reached the end of his rope &amp; considers suicide, a simple action by his daughter  draws him back from the edge &amp; he determines that he must try to help her, &quot;else another light go  out.&quot;  I found this to be somewhat too little too late, especially as his daughter has already gotten up  to no good.<br />I did find one thing remarkable about the book.  Steinbeck may well have been the last of the  significant traditional novelists.  It is such a pleasure to read a straightforward story that doesn't resort  to magical realism or interior monologue or other modernistic artifice.  At one point, Ethan says, &quot;A  man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading, for a story has as many  versions as it has readers.  Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his  measure.  Some pick out parts and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of  predjudice, some paint it with their own delight.  A story must have some points of contact with the  reader to make him feel at home in it.  Only then can he accept wonders.&quot;  Compare this to The Way  of All Flesh, where Samuel Butler stated that he didn't care if anyone ever read his books or to James  Joyce's completely inaccessible works.<br />It seems to me that this novel may stand as the demarcation of the end of a moral and a stylistic era.<br />GRADE:  Bems to me that this novel may stand as the demarcation of the end of a moral and a stylistic era.<br />GRADE:  B

0385486804|3.0|In April 1992, a young Emory University graduate named Chris McCandless, who had just given  $25K to Oxfam and changed his name to Alex Supertramp, walked into the Alaskan wilderness with a  couple books, a bag of rice and a .22 rifle.  He starved to death about 113 days later.  I'm not sure  there's any way to say this without sounding harsh, so I won't try, it is hard to believe that the human  gene pool wasn't strengthened by his death.<br />Jon Krakauer seems to have set himself a formidable career task--to explain to the average Joe why  people venture out into nature and do profoundly idiotic things.  I fear the task may be more than he,  or anyone else, can accomplish.  He goes to great lengths to try to render Chris McCandless sensible to  us, dismissing the notion that he was insane out of hand, comparing his own youth to Chris's  adventure, contrasting Chris to early explorers who met similar deaths, but in the end, he seems to be  arguing a losing case.  It seems likely from his behavior that Chris McCandless did have some kind of  mental illness or else he was so profoundly disrespectful of the might of the wild, that in some sense,  he deserved to die.<br />As I write this, in June of 1999, there's a young fella I work with who is heading off to Alaska with  several friends for a six week hike across a patch of wilderness that no humans may have ever  previously walked across.  He's a nice enough kid, bright (graduated from Bates &amp; when he gets back  he starts a Doctoral program at Dartmouth), sociable (he's going with friends), stable (he seems likely  to get married in August) and, most of all, realistic.  He and his friends have made thorough and  complicated preparations for this trip: they are taking everything from bear spray to antibiotics; they  are being resupplied by air in mid trip; they'll have survival beacons, etc..  In short, they recognize  that this is a hazardous venture and have taken sensible precautions to minimize the dangers.  I still  want him to make my kids the beneficiaries of his insurance policy, but I don't think he's acting out  some kind of death wish.<br />Chris McCandless' expedition stands in such stark contrast to this model, that, if he was sane, then I  for one feel he did little more than commit suicide.<br />Grade: CI still  want him to make my kids the beneficiaries of his insurance policy, but I don't think he's acting out  some kind of death wish.<br />Chris McCandless' expedition stands in such stark contrast to this model, that, if he was sane, then I  for one feel he did little more than commit suicide.<br />Grade: C

I'm sure even Mowgli the Jungle Boy must have heard this story once a year growing up in the  jungle.  But with all the TV and movie and cartoon and Muppet iterations (the best of which remains  the 1951 Alastair Sim movie version), when's the last time you went back and actually read the  original book?<br />Dickens is, of course, a wonderful author and earlier generations read everything that he wrote.  Today, however, you read an obligatory novel or two in High School, breath a sigh of relief that's  over and then blithely ignore him along with the rest of the ancients.  But, as a reacquaintance with A  Christmas Carol will remind you, he remains pretty accessible and his novels are often quite fun.  What's more, there's even a Reading Version (available online) of the story  that Dickens condensed himself for his numerous public readings of the tale.  It's perfect for reading  aloud to the family.<br />Here's just a sample of the prose to entice you:<br />On Scrooge before:  Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge. a squeezing, wrenching, grasping,  scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever  struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him  froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his  eyes  red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head,  and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with  him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.<br />and Scrooge after:  Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not  die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as  the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some  people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he  was  wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did  not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway,  he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less  attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.<br />  He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever  afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man  alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim  observed, God bless Us, Every One!<br />We, all of us, have a tendency to let the classics become so encrusted that we take them for granted  and forget how good they really are; if this has happened for you with A Christmas Carol, do yourself  a favor and dig out a copy and reread it this Holiday Season.

0515127485|5.0|Were it not for the uniformly glowing reviews that each of his books has gotten in every major media  outlet, you might well be able to convince me that I've overrated the thrillers of Robert Harris because  of the conservative themes of his books.  He's at it  again in Archangel, the premise of which is that Stalin may have left behind a secret notebook when  he died in March, 1953.<br />Once promising British historian of Soviet affairs, &quot;Fluke&quot; Kelso, is in post-Gorbachev Moscow for a  symposium on the status of the old archives of the Soviet Union.  After his speech he's approached by  an elderly Russian man who, over many drinks, tells him an amazing story.  The man, Papu Rapava,  was a very young bodyguard for Lavrenty Beria, the brutal head of the NKVD, Stalin's state security  agency.  He was on duty the night that Stalin had his fatal stroke and drove Beria to the scene, then  witnessed Beria hiding a notebook which he retrieved from Stalin's safe in the Kremlin.  Stalin was  notorious for not putting anything on paper, so when rivals toppled Beria from power, both he and  Rapava were tortured, but neither revealed the whereabouts of their find.<br />Kelso sees the notebook as a final chance to redeem his disappointing career, but his fellow historians  at the symposium think he's desperately grabbing at straws.  Soon though he's got the Russian secret  service and the shadowy remnants of the Communist Party on his tail and Rapava is murdered before  they can recover the notebook.  With the help of an American TV newsman and Rapava's daughter  Kelso sets out on a dangerous journey that will take them to the frigid woods of Archangel and to a  confrontation with Stalin's most dangerous legacy.<br />Like his other books, Harris uses the materials of actual history as a springboard for an exciting  adventure with insidious political overtones.  At one point the characters are discussing Russia's future  and suggest that it will be bleak until the nation honestly reckons with the monstrous crimes of Stalin  and Lenin.  As they point out, in present day Russia, which never had a Nuremberg Trials or a South  African-style Truth Commission, the Communist Party still receives a huge percentage of the vote in  national elections and a startling 24% of the populace considers Stalin to be the greatest leader in the  country's history.  Harris lays out the case against these butchers and, once again, the discomforting  subtext is that this is the regime that we cooperated with in WWII and then coexisted with for the next  half century.<br />During the Cold War, novelists like John Le Carre created a really unfortunate literature of moral  equivalency, which suggested that there was little or no difference between the West and the  Communist East.  That they and other  intellectuals of the Left were successful is evidenced by the morally bankrupt policy of d&eacute;tente, which  essentially represented our capitulation and an acceptance of the legitimacy of the Communists  abhorrent system of totalitarian rule. Today there's at least one author whose books demand that we  reconsider that whole period and our delusions about the Soviet Union, particularly in comparison to  Nazi Germany.  If you're looking for thrillers that, while action packed, will also make you think, you  owe it to yourself to read the books of Robert Harris.<br />GRADE : A-ion honestly reckons with the monstrous crimes of Stalin  and Lenin.

0385470819|4.0|The book was an re-awaking about the racial differences that went on through out our country a few years back. John Grisham knows how to make a person think about what goes on in his book even after you put it down. He's style of writing is very information throughout the beginning of the book, but by the end the information is what makes the ending so good. I, personally, didn't want to put the book down when i was getting close to the end of the book. The book, also, makes you think about how we can be fooled by persuasion from a good talker. This book is a action packed and is full of suspence.
B00004XONN|5.0|i was initially concerned with the tracklisting for kid a, as great songs like true love waits and nude weren't there. also, the album really did take me ages to get into, but when it does it turns out to be very special.  &quot;how to disappear&quot;, &quot;idioteque&quot; and &quot;national anthem&quot; are standout tracks, but the other tracks fit in really smoothly. the whole album is almost like a journey through musical styles, but my greatest advice is not to buy this and expect it to change your life or something.  critics aren't treating it like a piece of music. just chill out and listen to it.
B000002G23|5.0|PLEASE patch it up and do a reunion tour. This box is a must have for all the Police junkies who loved the rock/raggae masters and have one wish before they die. That the Police will get back together.<br />I was slightly surprised that they only had four CDs. Considering the how huge they were in the 80's it seemed like The Police would have had more material to offer. Of course I was only a pup back then. Even though there is not a lot here, as always, The Police have made up for quantity by using quality.<br />This stuff is timeless. As is probably the case with most who have this, I like the last two discs the best. Ghost in the Machine and Synchronicity are two of the best albums in existence. However, tracks like &quot;Can't Stand Losing You&quot;, &quot;So Lonely&quot;, and &quot;Driven to Tears&quot;, amongst others, make the first two discs worthy of listening.<br />The booklet included in the set has a &quot;Reader's Digest Version&quot; story of the band from small time beginning to distressing ending. The whole story could probably make a good book. Fifteen years is a long time to hold a grudge guys. Besides, if Men at Work can get back together, there must be some hope for The Police.
B00003CXE7|3.0|Well photographed and engrossing, but fundamentally unbelievable.  &quot;Gladiator&quot; has the Emperor of Rome fighting in the colosseum.  Yeah, right.  Don't watch the movie for historical accuracy, or (come to think of it) believable storyline.  Just enjoy the first toga romp for many a year.  Then hire &quot;Spartacus&quot;, which did it all better, but wasn't able to do some of the effects.
B000002JQ6|5.0|If there were two AC/DC CD's you had to buy, this would be one of them.  , To me this is almost a greatest hit album. The other great CD is &quot;High Way to Hell&quot;.  Both just great albums.  ThunderStruck is so awesome live on this CD and ShootToThrill is one of the best.  Brian Johnson's unique voice and Anugus's awesome guitar makes this a must buy album!
0553573403|5.0|This book and it's follow-on (Clash Of Kings) is a must-read for fans of fantasy.  In the tradition of The Once and Future King here is a tale of knights and ladies, kings and dwarfs, evil and good which will entrance you from the first chapter on.  Martin plots the story (and each chapter is written) from the point of view of many of the important protagonists of the story giving you insight into each of them and a more human view of characters whose actions might seem horrible without understanding their motivations.  And you will understand and feel for many of the characters.  Before the end of the first half of the book, I guarantee you will be so bound up in the fate of the Starks and the Lannisters that you will rush out to get the second book and eagerly await the third (which is due soon).  Get it; you won't regret it.
B000002HJD|4.0|This is a CD that asks for your attention.  It isn't for a Sunday Drive.  I think one should be amazed at the sheer quality of Morrison's voice that was fortunately preserved in a studio setting.  The music is good although The Doors do a theme that tends to get old in a few of the cuts.  The imagery is fantastic especially in the cut &quot;The Movie&quot;. This music does not sound like Tommy James and the Shondales.  You can find that at your local Goodwill store in the nickle bins unless a previous reviewer was there before you.
B000001A3H|5.0|The beginning of the End!!!!!!

B00004XQP4|5.0|First, I must say that this album, Warning, has the highest quality of production I have heard on any Green Day album to date.  All tracks sound very well produced.  Speaking of sound, Green Day's sound has definately matured.  There are no &quot;punk&quot; tracks on this album.  There is almost no explicit language to be found here either.  &quot;Minority&quot; is the only track containing any explicit language, the word &quot;f**k&quot;.  A definate departure from their past, where every other word on every other song was &quot;f**k&quot;.<br />On Warning, you will experience a broader sound.  Their thrashy guitars of the past have been replaced with well-tuned acoustics and electrics.  Drum beats are more simplistic, no more complicated &quot;Basket Case&quot; tempos.  Billie Joe's vocals sound better than ever.  Many of the tracks you will find are layered with keyboards, vocal effects, and other electronics.  Not to worry, the electronics are subtle and have no &quot;pop&quot; effect on the rock sound.  For instance &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;, a song about soul searching, and perhaps the best Green Day song ever, has a gentle keyboard in it's background providing a rich texture in harmony.  <br />Check out track 6, &quot;Misery&quot;.  This is the first Green Day track to ever exceed 5 minutes.  Not only is &quot;Misery&quot; the longest track on the album, it is also the most experimental.  The opening electronics, acoustic guitar, horn section, and clever lyrics tell a folky tale.  It's contageously heavy bass line will have you bobbing your head.  Most of the tracks on Warning exceed 3 minutes, unlike their 2 minute formulas of the past.<br />Green Day have abandoned their &quot;punk&quot; style for a more &quot;alternative&quot; sound, and if it weren't for Billie Joe's distinctive voice, you may not recognize this as a Green Day album at first listen.  Despite the changes, it is their best work to date.  Hardcore Green Day fans may snicker at the new, mature production, while the rest of the world will congratulate these 3 boys from the Bay Area for finally turning into men.
B00001MXWX|5.0|This is a great entry in the series! The mixture of comedy, romance, action, and sci-fi make it the best TREK film featuring the crew from THE NEXT GENERATION. The visual effects are more impressive in this film than they were in STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT. The bad guys were more badder than they have been (except for the Borg, Khan, and Chang). An exceptional STAR TREK film. Very well made. Frakes should try directing more films OTHER than STAR TREK. Grade: A+
B00004XONN|4.0|&quot;Where'd you park the car?&quot; Thom Yorke asks in &quot;Morning Bell,&quot; and if that isn't a slogan for our times I don't know what is. Coming from a band whose &quot;concert film&quot; looks like it was shot on department-store surveillance cameras, it's just another example of Radiohead's feel for the times. I was decidely underwhelmed when I first listened to this thing -- it struck me as perversely, intentionally homely. But after a few more listens, the incredible beauty of this music is dawning on me -- to the point that I don't want to hear anything else. Not unlike their last, 'OK Computer,' which I listened to exclusively for two months (first time since I was 12-year-old that an album had that sort of impact on me). Do the right thing and adopt 'Kid A.' This is music created without maps, without nets.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I can not think of one song on this album that i do not love or have lyrics that do not qualify as great poetry on their own! Ironically the weakest song of the bunch is &quot;Wild World&quot; which most people associate Cat with. &quot;Father and Son&quot; is a song that cannot be equaled, &quot;Longer Boats&quot; is another great example, &quot;On the Road to Find Out&quot; and &quot;Miles from nowhere&quot; reflect Cats spiritual quest....&quot;Where Do the Childern Play&quot; and &quot;Tea For The Tillerman&quot; are a great look at childhood innocence.....an over all great work of art.....
0440219078|4.0|I just finished reading The Giver.  It is definitely an interesting book.  I agree with some of the previous comments mentioned before on the subject of weither or not this story should be told to younger children.  It is in strong detail that may be somewhat traumatizing to younger readers, if they understand it at all.  However, definitely this book is for an age group of 12 and up.  Under that is questionable.   To give you a basic idea about the book without ruining anything: The name of the main character is Jonas.  And he lives in somewhat of a futuristic setting.  Everything in his life is perfect and colorless.  Yes, literally.  His day consists of waking up, getting ready for school, eating breakfast with his &quot;family unit&quot; and going to school.  Upon his arrival back home, he does his homework and then eats dinner with his family and shares and dreams that they had the night before.    Rules are many, and there is no emotion and basically empty.  However, no one knows of better life.    When you turn 12 you are assigned a job and start your training.  Jonas is chosen to be The Giver...  He then receives a new set of rules and his life is changed forever.  For better or worse?   This story is very dramatic and will capture your attention immediately.  Definitely a classic!
0811826848|5.0|Judging from the title, I expected this to read more like an exhaustive history of the Beatles--something that is always welcome, especially to me, but not necessarily new. Instead, what I found was a series of observations and reminiscences by the members, many of them brand new to me, and almost all of them engaging in a way that most writing on the Beatles isn't. For anyone truly interested in the group and its members, this book is required reading.
B00004XONN|4.0|Face it. Almost all the music you hear today has a similarity to another. Backstreet Boys &amp; NSTINQ are basically cloned from New Kids On The Block. And when you hear any rap-metal band you can't help it but to compare them to KoRn. The roots are the same but the way they blossom are slightly different. But with Kid A it seems as though there are no roots. It is very hard to categorize Kid A. When a album has catchy lyrics and familiar beats, the album gets old really fast. Kid A on the other hand, is the exact opposite of that. The first time you listen to it, it will not do anything for you. But the more you listen to it, the more you will FEEL the music. It will take alot of patience to understand Kid A. You have to dig deeeep to really feel Kid A. And then you will realize that everything is in it's right place.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album preoduces sounds no one has ever heared before. It is comperable to discovering a completely new color.  It's difficult to grasp on first listen; there's just too much.  This is the future of music; it is the most original and fresh piece of artwork aorund today.
0671047043|3.0|In Angela's Ashes Frank McCourt told of his fascinatingly difficult path from moving from Brooklyn to Ireland, seeing terrible poverty and death and his road of learning both in school and out.  Angela's Ashes was a compelling story of a difficult child hood in Ireland.    One of the weakest aspects of the story, though, was the length.  If it bothers you than I don't recommend this book.  But, if you don't mind then take up the challenge.  It flows very well though some parts I can admit to skipping a couple of paragraphs.  I think that though sometimes slightly tedious the not so significant times make the good times better.  At times you want to quit but if you keep coming back even when the family hits a rough patch you will end up with a beautiful, moving story of growing up.   If you stick through the book you will learn all about the McCourt family.  But mostly you learn about Francis McCourt.  He is the oldest of many siblings and always has to stay responsible.  You learn of his trails and triumphs, his decisions both good and bad, and the harshness of his school, church, and family.  You could really feel the \\"voice\\" of the story.  You could tell when the \\"voice\\" matured. It remained the same tone throughout.  Throughout the whole story you get closer and closer to Francis McCourt as he lost his childhood innocence and moved on to new things.    There are certainly themes in this book including alcoholism, Catholicism, and learning in a permanently harsh schooling system.  The McCourts were always, always looking for food and money.  But sadly Mr. McCourt was usually losing the jobs he gained and spending his wages on pints of Guinness. It was a difficult read at times, I will not deny that. But I promise your heart will find a place for the McCourt family as you read on.  You will learn of Francis' lost siblings, the angel on the seventh step, and his strange, mean Irish grandmother.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed Angela's Ashes and recommend it highly.
6304602979|3.0|This is pretty messed up.  There are a few scenes that were so violent I curled up into a ball and cried for hours before unpausing the movie.  Overall, it's a good piece of cinema (if you can stand Christian Slater's constant Jack Nicholson impression) from Quentin Tarantino (he wrote it, but didn't direct).  Some dialogue that would later pop up in PULP FICTION, but that's ok.
B000002JAX|5.0|When i heard &quot;i'm going to sit right down and write you a letter&quot; i started singing.. can't stop. madeline is great, she needs to do some of her own work and she's certainly in the same class as Diana Krall.. buy it you won't be let down, i wasn't
B000002UAU|1.0|The idea of this being the greatest album of all time!  It's a joke! Before heaving yourself onto the &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; bandwagon, consider investigating some other, substantial music.  If it's art you're searching for, consider Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; a brilliant, more popular album that is light-years ahead of this corny, pompous horse dung. If you're in search of &quot;rock as art,&quot; consider Led Zeppelin, a band whose best albums make this seem like the stuff of a middle school talent show. So please, before polluting my monitor with phrases like &quot;the best album ever&quot; and &quot;the finest rock in history,&quot; find out what's out there.  You just might be blown away.
B00001R3GI|1.0|this album probABLY is the bomb for people whom like draggy &quot;blues&quot; masterpieces. while this album may fuse different styles and the guitar work is skillful....it's just a complete waste of time as 80% of the album sounds the same,a part from rocks off and the overrated tumbling dice, the album just rambles on and on. the songs are paced at a drone and really....it's not exactly fantastic or what the stones are really capable of. this is when the stones lost whatever flash they had and became *sigh* a &quot;blues&quot; band. it's exactly what the black album is for metallica,manic rock and roll geniuses slowing the pace down...just like metallica, they would never produce anything great after this monotonous low.
0800179501|5.0|I'm really upset with the people that made the one and only KARATE KID in regular format.  You know what I think.  They offered it in regular version first so that y'all will buy it thinking there will never be widescreen...THEN they'll spring the widescreen on you when you already own the regular edition.  How sneaky they are!  Don't buy it just yet...wait till next year they'll have it!  They HAVE TO...I'm hoping.  All in all I love this movie and its a classic that I enjoy watching over and over.  You will too if you haven't seen karate kid...which shouldn't be the case if your a movie lover.  Enjoy!
B00004XONN|5.0|This record defies categorization. Reference points for those who rely on them include: Autechre, Eno's ambient period, King Crimson, a little Nick Drake folksiness, John Coltrane, DJ Shadow, even a little Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.  For those whose ears are offended by this record's musical sensibilities, which steadfastly lie outside the 1990s alt-rock paradigm, don't bother with this record, for it will only confound and bewilder you. Repeated listenings to this record will only prove futile and it'd be like banging your head against the wall trying to gain an ounce of comprehension of this record.  With this record Radiohead have finally emerged upon a major epiphany of discovery:  There are no boundaries, there are no genres, there are no divisions. Radiohead make records like Kubrick made movies: every detail within the work was put there for a purpose; every nuance is planned. Kubrick wasn't a genre director, he didn't make 'war movies' or 'romantic comedies' or 'suspense movies'; He made MOVIES. Radiohead in the same respect create MUSIC.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Legends of the Fall is a very moving and emotional film about family, and how a family that was once together becomes broken apart by the miseries of war.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves those tearjerkers, and of course a great film!
0684853523|5.0|One reviewer had the nerve to say S. King doesn't detail what C.V. stands for in the memoir section of his book.  He does tell.  I won't spoil it for you by telling.  What Mr. King doesn't tell is whether the teeth were real or dentures.  That is what I wanted to know.<br />This book is hugely entertaining to read.  Even if you never plan to write; read this book.  I enjoyed learning more about Mr. King's early life and his battles with alcohol and the famous accident.  He gives his fans details about his life which made him the person he is today.  I would liked to have heard more about it all.<br />The sections on writing give interesting tidbits without going into huge amounts of detail.  Mr King said for once he was going to be brief and he certainly was that.  I would liked to have learned more about where story ideas came from and what went into some of his books.  I was very interested to know how much writing he did as a child, teen and adult before &quot;Carrie&quot; ever happened.  The amount of time and energy he put into writing things which never saw print should give any hopeful aspiring writer courage to continue on.<br />I also liked hearing Mr King say that being a writer takes time every day before anything happens.  And he is totally disenchanted by people who say they want to write but don't have time to read.  I am like Mr King in this.  I do not understand people who don't read.  That is so far my being that I am actually fascinated by people who never read.  Mr King's advise of read read read and write every day was very good advise.   I liked his closed-door analogy also.<br />In short, this is a book for every S. King fan, even those who are not deeply interested in becoming writers themselves.
044022165X|4.0|One of Grisham's better books. Great story and great characters. A rookie lawyer up against a multi-million dollar insurance company and their well-paid lawyer team.
6300216047|5.0|Most people who see this film have entirely missed the point. Many think this is a betrayal of the values of feminisim.. On the contrary... This film is a reaction to the sexist &quot;boy's club&quot; that was the space program in the 1960s. It was believed that females were incompatible with space missions because their sexuality would distract the men on board and screw up the quest for knowledge. This movie makes fun, to an extreme, of that ridiculous notion.  By using her sexuality overtly, Barbarella means not to objectify herself but to boldly thumb her nose at the sexism inherent in the space program (as well as many other industries) of the 1960s.<br />With that in mind it is both a hilarious and meaningful film, however silly it may be.
B00003CXFV|1.0|Ok, so maybe I just don't get it.  I guess that I'm in the extreme minority here -- but I didn't much care for the movie &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;.  I didn't find Brockovich to be an admirable person, much less a hero, and I have grave disappointments concerning the fidelity of the movie to actual events.<br />Item:  Repeatedly throughout the movie, Ms. Brockovich is portrayed as &quot;doing this for her children&quot; or some similar line.  Yet her home life was chaotic at best, her relationship with her kids was awful, and her relationship with her boyfriend (who actually DID seem to care for the kids) was also unimpressive.   (She has since dumped him.)<br />Item:  The movie played fast and loose with the actual facts of the matter.  In the months since the movie's release, numerous syndicated columnists have demonstrated scientific inaccuracies, fiscal irregularities as far as payments to &quot;victims&quot;, exorbident attorney's fees, etc.  <br />Item:  The heroic attorney figure has, in real life, not tended toward the highest examples of the ethics of his profession.  He was a religious cult lawyer, an attorney FOR polluters, and was a convicted felon.<br />Item:  In real life, many residents of Hinckly are terribly bitter toward Brockovich.<br />It's politically correct, nowadays, to bash large corporations as intrinsically evil.  For that matter, it's also politically correct to promote &quot;single mother makes good&quot; themes.  But the real facts of the story show that the movie heros aren't at all what they seem.<br />But once again, Hollywood wins.  The REAL victim is the truth.
B00003CXE7|4.0|This film is a magnificent performance by one of the most intense actors on the screen today.  Russell Crowe easily solidifies his name as one of the top actors of the day.  The film is grand and Ridley Scott has definitely created a masterpiece in the same vein as Braveheart, El Cid, or Ben-Hur.  Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and shows a strong range of acting ability.  Russell Crowe's character who is seeking only peace, must walk through a fire of life in order to gain it.  Crowe portrays a Roman Soldier and gladiator with a sense of honor that one would find in a Marine.  Crowe never loses faith in his purpose to do what he must do, and he honors his word, his family, and the former emperor Marcus Aurelius (Oliver Reed)in the film.  Dijon Honshu (Amistad) plays a good friend and confidant to Maximus.  It is truly a marvelous movie, and a masterpiece of a film.  It is a great story from an incredible and epic time.
0811826848|5.0|Although many Beatles fans might already be familiar with Beatles history, this autobiographical account finally gives us the story from the inside out.  I must agree that the one drawback of the book, is that some of it is directly taken from the interviews done in the Anthology videos, however, the narrartive does flow very well and one could tell that great pains were taken to preserve the chronological order of the story.  It's also interesting to see how all four of them remember some of the same events differently. This becomes evident early on when one reads John's account of how he asked Paul to join the Quarry Men on the very first day, and Paul recalls being asked by one of the other Quarry Men the day after having met John.  All of the accounts, though many of them conflict, are told with poignant honesty and there's a lot that one can come away with by witnessing the events from four different perspectives.  Having read other books about the Beatles, it's refreshing to read the stories from the Beatles themselves even when reading through events that have been dissected exhaustively in the past.  Much like listening to their musical legacy, the book has the affect of giving one the feeling that one is experiencing the story for the very first time.  Many previously unreleased pictures and hand written lyrics are also prominently featured throughout the book.  Indeed, one could spend entire day just looking at the pictures before reading the narrative. This is also a huge book.  367 pages may not seem like a lot, but there's a lot of information packed into those pages and for the most part, it's very thorough.  I'm sure some other Beatles fans will probably find something to complain about or say that it left out such and such a detail, but considering the vast amount of information chronicled on the Beatles, this book does a pretty fair job of compiling all the major details and some little known facts.  There are day by day accounts on the Beatles written by people who either barely knew them or didn't know them at all and the quality of those books vary a great deal, but if one is so inclined to know every single last detail about the Beatles I'm sure that there is no shortage of material out there for one to look through.  This book, however, does what it was meant to do, which is capture the major events and some little known details from the perspective of those 4 musicians that history will never forget.
B00004XONN|3.0|Yes folks, the similarities with Floyd persist - even though you want them to stop.  Radiohead have obviously got to the &quot;je suis un artiste&quot; point in their lives and produced an interesting background soundtrack, but this is not what made them famous.  They are famous for their great sounding popsongs - how many times do you have to skip past the tedious computer-voice bit in OK Computer ?  Why don't they just come to grips with the fact that they do great rock music and keep doing that ? Watch the album sales fall if the next one is like this.  A disappointment after this long wait.
0811826848|5.0|Wow.  What an amazing book.  I'm still recovering from flipping through it.  Gorgeous visuals, pictures, collages.  Intriguing quotes, stories, text.  Completely perfect and fascinating history of the Beatles, told in their own words.  A must-have!!!  UNBELIEVABLE!
0811826848|5.0|Okay, I'll be quick  - - - a great book in the great Beatle style - - you get your money's worth.  The design of the book is what they call &quot;fantastic!&quot; where I come from - - - humorous, serious, Beatle-deep, poignant, and SATISFYING. I think that it's obvious who will truly like the book and who will not.   If the Beatles are a life-affirming laughing get up and sing-something inspiration to you, than this book delivers!!! (It reminds me of Rubber Soul and Revolver.)   I've studied, read, looked, listened to it all, and this is the only Beatle book that imparts that ineffable Beatle emotion - - it doesn't PROMISE to do that -  it just stands up and does it.  Which again, is a great Beatle &quot;quality&quot; - -        Of course, the curiosity for &quot;The Beatles&quot; is inexhaustible, and the idea of a definitive book that captures everything is impossible to carry out.   But this stands as best as anything could have.  If there is a Beatle-spirited person in your life somewhere, than pass this book along - - he/she (hishi?) will be singing any moment now.
0141301120|1.0|I've read the positive reviews for this book, and I just can't understand them.  It's fairly obvious to me what happened -- in 1972, with the success of the movie version (1971) of the first book, the author probably answered the call for a sequel to the 1964 classic.  Too bad.  While the original is a timeless and charming (with a thoughtful message), this book is choppy, disjointed, and poorly written.  Worse, there's just no point to it at all.  Pages and pages are devoted to a rather silly saga of the elevator in space, which perhaps would have been marginally interesting in 1972, but badly dated at this point.  That's the first half of the book.  The rest of the book is wasted on the grandparents getting younger, then older, then younger again, by means of Mr. Wonka's concoctions.  That really is all that it is about.  Does that sound interesting to you?  Again, no point at all.  It just rambles on page after page as if Mr. Dahl's advance were based on the page count.  Mercifully, the book ends.  Nothing about the factory.  Nothing about Charlie growing up.  Nothing about Mr. Wonka teaching Charlie anything.  I suggest you avoid it.
B000009RC2|5.0|I just got this CD a few months ago, and it's been in or near my CD player ever since! John McLaughlin is one of the top 5 greatest guitarists of ALL time, way up there, and this CD is very good proof. This debut CD by the band was, in a simple word, electrifying. The whole album is just filled with an intense amount of energy that is so incredible that you wouldn't believe that this CD isn't as famous as it should be. This was THE jazz band of the early 70's, they were at the top, and deservedly so. Not only is John a virtuoso at what he does,  all of these guys are (well, maybe not the bass guitarist, but pretty good though). Billy Cobham just pounds and crashes like crazy here, and Jerry Goodman is strong as well. I wasn't as moved by Jan Hammer here as the others, which is kinda sad, considering the great playing he did on some of Jeff Beck and Al Di Meola's albums. There's just so much variety, so much intensity: &quot;Meeting of the Spirits&quot; is like Jimi Hendrix on steroids, John was and is much more skilled and versatile than Hendrix. The most important thing I have to say is: if you've heard of these guys but never listened to them for some reason, don't wait any longer!! If you love hard rock, progressive rock, then this CD will definetly satisfy. Buy it today!
B00003CWOL|5.0|Forget about any controvery, this movie is a laugh a minute. Being Catholic I was wary of this film, knowing the church was not too pleased with it. Having watched it once, I then bought the DVD.<br />Granted, Smith takes some artistic license here. I doubt that there was a 13th apostle and I doubt that Jesus had brothers and sisters that we never heard about, but he uses his &quot;theories&quot; with amazing comedic effect. He also mixes in some poignant generaliztions about the faith that ring somewhat true (i.e. Salma Hayek &quot;Catholics don't celbrate their faith , they suffer it)<br />The cast in this flick is great. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are a couple of fallen angels looking for a loophole that will get them back into heaven. Damon is surprisingly relaxed and funny in his portrayal as the angel of death Loki. The only people that can stop them are Linda Florentino (the last zion), Rufus the unknown 13th black apostle, and Jay and Silent Bob (the prophets?). Chris Rock is hillarious as Rufus and Jay and Silent Bob are......well if you have ever seen a Kevin Smith movie you know they are good for some laughs.<br />Other supporting cast include Salma Hayek (serendipity - wow, dont miss her dance scene!) and George Carlin(priceless as the cardinal). Overall the cast is fantastic although Linda Florentino was a little off on her timing.<br />Watch this film with an open mind and you'll watch it again. If you are easily offended, don't even bother....let the rest of us enjoy it.
B0000025US|5.0|I have to just say, I love this album! These three guys were at their prime as a group, and you can definetly tell. On their first CD, it was all live, and it had it share of faults and everything, and plus the guys weren't as telepathic as most groups are. Well, they'd been together a few years here, and the result is incredible. I'd say that this is the fastest guitar music i've ever heard in my life, these guys were shredding amazingly fast, and a year or two before Yngwie was in the main stream! The only problem I have with this CD is that it's too short! I'd bet that this album is barely 30 minutes long, if even that. Al himself said in an interview once that it was defintely too short, and that if they'd do something like that these days, they'd go to hell! It's a great CD though, if you love great acoustic music, then definetly get this. They really do play with passion, grace, and fire....intensity and emotion.
B000002UAR|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the finest, if not THE finest, musical statements ever made in rock/pop. It's certainly the Beatles finest work. McCartney and Lennon were at their creative peaks then, and were working together to form some of the most memorable pop/rock songs of all time.<br />The mark of a great recording is how bad the worst songs are. Well, in this case, they're &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; &quot;I Want To Tell You,&quot; and &quot;Love You To,&quot; each good songs in their own right. However, when they're juxtaposed to out and out mind-blowers like &quot;Elanor Rigby,&quot; &quot;Taxman,&quot; &quot;For No One,&quot; &quot;Dr. Robert,&quot; &quot;She Said, She Said,&quot; &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life,&quot; and the ultimate trip song, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,&quot; they seem ordinary. On any other record, they'd stand out. Shows you just how strong a collection Revolver was, and still is.
B00004XONN|1.0|The nicest praise that can be levelled at this album is that it is different. Everything is in it's Right Place is almost unlistenable, with its splinters of Thom Yorke's vocals flickering in sporadically. The soft, keyboard atmospherics wear thin extremely quickly and are repetitive. After 10 listens, this album still doesn't hit, and there is not one song that I am going to put on my Best of Radiohead Mini-Disc. People who have been enjoying the album, answer this question: Do you truly like the album for its music and that alone, or is it only because it is a Radiohead release that you are prepared to accept it? In taking away the hype, forgetting which band released Kid A and concentrating upon the music alone, you are left with a very poor album indeed.
055321263X|5.0|The Woman in White is probably the best known of all the Wilkie Collins novels.  It contains all the ingregients he is famous for, romance, mystery, drama and of course suspense.  Being a very experiemental author of Victorian times Wilkie Collins wrote the Woman in White with more than one voice.  The story is first told from the view point of a drawing teacher, but throughout the novel different voices are added, even the fascinating villan of the piece gets to voice his side of the story.  As always Wilkie Collins creates a set of three dimensional characters for readers to love or hate.  The Woman in White is not just a novel, but an experience.
0345308239|4.0|I would have liked to to have said great, but like others I feel this work does not quite meet the standard set by The Guns of August and her study of Stillwell.  Still, Tuckman's storytelling ability comes through and I enjoyed every section. <br />Her piece on Viet Nam may upset some readers.  As a resident in Japan,@ham contantly encountering historicle revisionism from the locals concerning their aggerssion and folly in World War Two and I fear that some Americans wish do the same with our great mistake in Viet Nam.  Tuckman provides one of the best analyses to date about this great tragedy.

But it also focuses on the lives of ronin, travelling warriors called                                         samurai with no masters, and their struggles for survival and dignity.<br />                                        One of Akira Kurosawa's finest films was directed based on the                                         'westerns' genre created in the US, but ironicly became an inspiration for                                         almost every western made after it. Its influences can be seen in movies                                         like 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'The Wild Bunch'.<br />                                        Topping a cast in which every role seemed perfectly acted are                                         Takahashi Shimura, playing the wise and crafty leader of the samurai,                                         and the late Toshiro Mifune playing the drunk swordsman who turns out                                         to be the most noble of all.<br />                                        This movie is a glorious and tragic look at the life of the farmer and the                                         mercenary, and even the bandit.<br />                                        Ultimately, this film ranks as one of the greatest ever created..
068484267X|4.0|Innocence.  Growing up in Ireland Frank MCcourt was deprived of his childhood innocence.  He was forced to grow up fast and pass over what could have been a world full of fun and exciting childhood memories.  His life was hungry for more than just food.  He was hungry for childhood.   Innocence in childhood simply skipped.<br /> One quality that this book possesses is that you really feel as though as though you are growing up again with Frank MCcourt. You travel through his experiences by his side through the streets of Limerick.  You almost feel troubled with his difficult events. You almost want to help him.  So buckle up in for an emotion roller coaster.<br /> Another quality of this book is the incredibly vivid detail and description.  You as a reader are able to visualize the scenery.  You are able to feel the emotions of the family in a small degree.  You get the hunger for life reading the book.<br /> A quality that I didn't like was the tendency to drag on a topic.  I felt that even after the thought had been rung out and dried up they were continued a bit to long.  This quality made it difficult to read because it was a challenge to stay involved in the story.  The plot was drawn out and quite over used.  Angela's ashes was a remarkable story about a young boy becoming a man.  A boy supporting his family at the age of thirteen.  It is sad yet beautiful the way his heart is true.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is perfect. Quite simply, it resonates the verve of life and the freakish nastiness of art. This is art and music in perfect harmony. Buy it.
B00004XONN|1.0|&quot;Kid A&quot; might be the worst travesty promoted to a gullible public since Lou Reed's &quot;Metal Machine Music.&quot;  Then again, that might be giving Radiohead too much credit, since Lou Reed knew that he was just making noise.  Sure, there are a couple of listenable tracks (&quot;The National Anthem&quot; and the downright beautiful &quot;Optimistic&quot;) but most of it sounds like ambient refuse.<BR> This is the kind of album that you put in with the &quot;real&quot; album as a bonus.  I hear that Radiohead have another more traditional album coming out soon.  They would have done their fans a great service by packaging this for free with that album rather than releasing it first and charging full price.  By the time the next album comes out, I doubt they will have as many fans willing to buy it.  (Since I wrote this I looked at the reviews, and realized that most of you thing this pretentious garbage is good for some reason...so unfortunately I'm probably wrong on that last sentence.)<BR> At the end of the last track there is the requisite long lapse of silence, hinting at a bonus track.  I was half expecting to hear the boys apologizing for the joke they've played on all of us...but instead it ends with another very brief deluge into ambient nonsense.<BR> To be fair, I've never been a huge Radiohead fan, though I think they're much better than most of the alternacrap out there.  I enjoyed &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and loved &quot;The Bends.&quot;  I thought &quot;OK Computer&quot; was passable but overrated.<BR> I'm all for bands experimenting, but this is ridiculous.  From now on guys, leave the minimalist compositions to Glass, Reich, and Adams.  And how many of you that gave this album a five-star review own an album by any of those guys?<BR> I hear Radiohead snickering again...
B000050FEN|5.0|A thriller with meaning and style.Good directing from David Fincher.Unlike his other fellow-MTV-music-directors he shows allot of promise.We will forgive him for ALIEN 3, but with his other films since like,THE GAME and FIGHT CLUB(as with this one) he proves he can show us something truely dark and still have the respect to tell us a good story along the way.Seven is good only because everyone involved from Morgan Freeman to Brad Pitt gives out standout performes.It's dark and takes it time, but don't look away because you'll be rewarded with one of the best films from the 90's.
B000050FEN|5.0|It's about time this fine film gets a New Line Platinum Series release.  Definitely the best film from director David Fincher.  Incredible performances from Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey.  Now I've read the screenplay for &quot;Se7en&quot; and the film really stays with the screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker.  The differences from the screenplay to film is the entire beginning, a much longer/slightly different ending and very small character details.  These should all be included on this 2 discs DVD release and much more.  It's great to know that the director and the entire cast fought the studio to have the ending as close to the screenplay as possible.  Of course the studio wanted the ending to be more censored.  But let me tell you &quot;Se7en&quot; has one of the very best endings to a film.  It really completes the film to make it a great film.  A Top 10 of all time type movie.  Needless to say anything I write about the plot will somehow spoil it for those who know nothing about the movie.  The contrast between Detectives Mills and Somerset is incredible yet in the end they stand for the same ideals.  Well it's about a killer named John Doe who uses the seven deadly sins against the sinners themselves.  Detective Mills is the younger of the 2 detectives; he's just full of life and energy.  He really loves his job.  Detective Somerset the older, more patient is on the verge of retirement.  He won't miss the big city and all the crime too much when he retires. They must work together to try and stop the series of seven.  Honestly, just buy this Platinum Series DVD as soon as it is available or right now.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|Wow! This album is remarkble, in more than one way...The energy throughout is fantastic...A lot of the songs really get your blood pumping, get you dancing around the room like a maniac. The two or so songs that I sometimes skip are &quot;She's Got Issues&quot; and &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job?&quot;, because they're not up-tempo enough for me right then, not because they aren't great...The lyrics of literally *every* song are intelligent, intricate, sometimes biting and sarcastic, but always thought-provoking and never trite. The music itself can be equally sarcastic (such as the tune &quot;Walla Walla&quot;), but is always well-crafted. The best thing I can say about this album is that it provokes you to move, think, express yourself, and release yourself all at once, without the music ever getting boring.
B00003CXE7|5.0|WOW! GLADIATOR is a MUST SEE film. It is the BEST movie ever made. It is full of adrenalin pumping action, heart grasping drama, bold emotions, and maginficent picture. Ancient Rome has never looked so good on a screen before. I have seen GLADIATOR 11 times and it only gets better........ well, that's kind of impossible since nothing can really get better than GLADIATOR, but you know what I mean. Russell Crowe is one AMAZING actor, he portrayed Maximus with perfection. Every actor and actress in this movie is AMAZING! I don't want to go on about EVERY SINGLE GREAT aspect of GLADIATOR, so I will say this one last time. GLADIATOR IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!
B000002UAX|1.0|The Beatles were probably the best white pop band of the sixties and there are great songs here, but there is just way too much crap.  Lennon is responsible for most of the useless songs here.  This could have been a great single album.
0790729636|4.0|Like Armageddon, Godzilla, and Independence Day this is one of those summertime films with an embarrassingly bad screenplay but great special effects.   Some of the things that are just plain stupid about this file are: The actors are shown within a few feet of a tornado  yet there hair is barely moving around and their truck sits motionless.   The wind is able to blow a house across the road or lift up a semi-truck yet they seem unaffected. The whole premise of the film is that, currently, people only get a 10-minute warning before a tornado is going to strike an area - but the main characters seem to know where the tornadoes are going to be hours ahead of time.   Then there is the evil meteorologist (in his fleet of black vans) that  \\" is only it for the money.\\"  (I didn't know that there were bad meteorologists and good ones.)  Lighted neon signs fly through the air (where are they getting power from??) I could go on and on and on, but you get the idea.  <br />What saves this movie and makes it fun to watch are the special visual effects and sound effects.  This is a great movie to watch when you want to turn your brain off after a hard day's work and just have some fun.  The chemistry between Hunt and Paxton is pretty good and both actors seem to be trying their best despite the poor quality of the script.  I have to give the screenwriters credit for making the Gertz character (the other woman) a likeable person that just gets caught in the middle.  The predictable thing to do would have been to make her a.... I won't use the \\"B\\" word or Amazon won't print this review.  <br />The quality of the DVD - sound and picture - is very good. <br />I have probably watched this movie a dozen times and enjoy it each time.  Sure it's mindless, but it's fun.  Turn on the TV. Turn down the lights. Turn up the volume and enjoy it.
0783117388|5.0|Even though I've seen every episode since the show began airing, I had to buy a copy of the first season.  The show's approach to sex is so witty and blunt at the same time, you can't help but smile at the thing's its character's do.<br />Miranda, Carrie, Charlotte, and Samantha make every independent woman proud of who they are.  The diversity of the show's characters, from their careers to their beaus to their level of sexual activity leaves everyone someone to identify with.  And yes, we've all had a Mr. Big in our lives.  I can't say enough good things about the show, and this box-set, so you'll just have to watch it for yourself.
B000006OAM|5.0|This cd has reached me like none other.  I've bought hundreds of Amazon books and music cd's, read thousands of reviews, and this cd prompted me to write my first review.  A friend told me her ex husband is a druggie on the street, an outcast of society; now obsessed with Sarah M; his savior.  I understand the bond.  Natalie in this cd, like Sarah in her 2 latest studio cd's, reach you at the core.  They rescue you from the mediocre behavior of humanity that Ayn Rand found so despicable and prevalent in her novels.  They save us from our disgust with glory seeking musicians.  When I listened for the first few times, I clicked next track often.  Now after hundreds of listens, the music continues to blossom in my soul.  Tracks 5, 10, and 11 all lift me like Clapton's passion for Layla.  Three Layla-caliber tracks in one cd.  Track 11 is Natalie's Layla, in fact.  The elaborate cover, showing Natalie in costumes casting her in the characters of the songs undercut the artistic purity of the cd.  I want to think the producers made her do it.   I have most of 10,000 Maniac's and Natalie's cd's.  This one stands above them all by an order of magnitude.  It is like she achieved a soul bond/buzz with the band, particulary the harmonizing with Karen Peris, like Fleetwood Mac did with Rumours.  Sanguine types will find this cd boring I reckon, but deeper, purity hungry brethren will find introspective salvation.
6305949638|5.0|The Cider House Rules was a wonderful film, full of happy and terrifying moments.  I have to admit my favorite character was Fuzzy (the little blond boy who plays Dewy on Malcolm in the Middle).  Beside his physical image of innocence, his life is so full of wonder and awe that you just want to hold him in your lap everytime he's on screen.<br />This is definantly and adult movie, and I was especially engaged by the openness with which the film dealt with abortion and incest.  It was truly heart-wrenching and beautiful, all at once.  It was a wonderful movie to watch.
B00004XONN|5.0|I wish I could say that I've been a Radiohead fan from the start.  I wish I could say that I discovered them before anyone else.  But truthfully I didn't even hear about them until OK Computer.  I bought the cd because I heard it was good and Karma Police sounded awesome.  I got the cd and found out that the learning curve was very steep, at least for me.  It took me a while, but eventually I actually felt the need to listen through the album quite often.  To this day OK Computer is probably my favorite album.  Since then I've picked up The Bends, and finally picked up Pablo Honey just recently.  From listening to the other albums I knew that there was not much to prepare for.  Radiohead is wonderful about switching stuff around just when you prepare for it.  Anyway, I watched the premiere of Kid A on MTV2 several weeks ago.  It didn't grab me at first.  In fact, it frightened me because I thought I might dislike the album.  But, because MTV2 has the habit of playing the same thing over and over again, and because I'm in college and the tv in my dorm room is almost invariably tuned to one music channel or another I ended hearing the portions of the album several times over the next few weeks.  The result: I found myself humming portions of songs I couldn't remember hearing before.  I wondered if I'd actually heard those tunes before or if I was starting to hum musical phrases that I'd made up myself.  After buying the album on Tuesday and listening to it for the second time I realized where the music was coming from.  Although I'd only actually focused on the album once before, and other than that only heard bits and pieces of it drifting around the rooms and halls, it was already in my mind.  Which is, I believe, the best way to describe this album.  You can't pick much out of this album at first, but instantly your subconscience begans recording, remixing, and replaying tracks from the album.  Although this album doesn't have the radio/air quality as OK Computer Ithink that in the long run Kid A will be regarded as the more superior, if not at least more exploratory.  What makes this album, whether you realize it or not, is that Radiohead ditched everything that had worked for them before, the vocals, guitars, ... anything and everything, and started from scratch.  Noone else does the same thing.  At least not purposely and consistently.
630516889X|5.0|Schwarzenegger was born to star in this movie.  He may have gained more fame for the Terminator flicks, but this is his finest hour, an absolute gem.  There are more memorable one-liners in Predator than in any Eastwood or Bogart movie.  The DVD is a decent transfer as well, though not anamorphic.  All in all, just about perfect.
0684853523|5.0|ON WRITING provides a glimpse into the mind and motivations of Stephen King, as well as blunt, straightforward advice about writing as a profession.  You get the impression that the contemporary master of popular horror is a pretty down-to-earth, likeable guy, with working-class values and lot of humility to compliment his considerable talents (which he downplays more than he needs to).  Excellent advice on the skill--the craft--of writing, which King states (as have many before him) is something that must be developed and then maintained through constant use--like a muscle.  Well worth reading: it goes on my reference shelf along with ELEMENTS OF STYLE and WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY.  When you need a boost in your own writing, a little extra motivation, this book will do the trick.  Good job, Steve, and thanks.
B000005S37|1.0|How anyone can blather on about MMM being &quot;art&quot; or &quot;musical&quot; is borderline perverse. Lou wasn't even in the room when the thing was recorded ! I wonder what else is considered worthy of 5 stars ...The Shaggs ? The Chipmunks ?
0385484518|5.0|Life's Greatest Lessons In a Nutshell<br />\\"The last class of Morrie's life took place once a week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves.\\" Tuesdays with Morrie, by Mitch Albom, is a compelling story, about an old man, a young man, and life's greatest lessons.  One of the best qualities of this book is the characters. Mitch Albom describes himself as a man that has grown up too fast, and is basically a workaholic. But Morrie wanted to change that. Morrie helped mold Mitch into the man that he is today. A man that treasures life for all that it is worth. Mitch said of himself that before he reconnected with Morrie that \\"he buried himself in accomplishments, because with accomplishments, he believed he could control things, he could squeeze in every last piece of happiness before he got sick and died.\\"  Another great quality of Tuesdays with Morrie is the humor. At appearance this does not look like a funny book. But there were moments I found myself laughing out loud at little things that Morrie said or did.  Tuesdays with Morrie was very inspiring. It made me want to spend more time with my elders and have the \\"life's greatest lessons\\" from their points of view. It gave me a better understanding of life. It made me want to go out in the world and be a better person.  The one thing that wasn't terrific about the book is its predictability. There were no big surprises in the book, but I guess that was kind of necessary and that it helped make the story.  Tuesdays with Morrie, is truthfully one of the best books that I've ever read. It was an inspiring story that made you feel complete, just by reading it. \\"Have you ever really had a teacher? One who saw you as a raw but precious thing, a jewel that, with wisdom, could be polished to a proud shine? If you are lucky enough to find your way to such teachers, you will always find your way back.\\"
B00004XONN|5.0|This is not an album to listen to a little bit at a time; you will almost certainly be disappointed with it.  Sit down in a comfortable chair and listen from start to finish.  Do it again.  Allow yourself to listen to it once without concentrating on anything else.  The primary beauty in this album is the complexity of the layers of sound and tone that form one, often simple piece of music.<br />If you like radio-friendly, melodic music that you can dance to, well, this might not be for you.  It isn't for everybody.  But it is an outstanding piece of work, and one that I would heartily recommend to anyone who enjoys a flowing, alter-orchestral composition.
B00000J7JO|4.0|My knowledge of RHCP is somewhat restricted: I know &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; (a classic) and &quot;Give it away now&quot; (merely because it was used in the Simpsons!). But I do know that this is a great album. The band seems to have taken a less aggressive approach to their music, music that is an amazing synthesis of rock and hip-hop. This has thus spawned gems like Otherside, Californication (check out the video), Scar Tissue and Around the World. With the bass line pumping rhythmically through all these songs, it becomes very hard not to hum these songs to yourself all day long. This album is more accessible than their previous works, so it would fit in well to most decent CD collections. PURCHASE NOW!
0195067142|5.0|Author Eugene Sledge served as a mortarman with the 1st Marine Division during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa.  His devasting account of the horrors he witnessed are a must read for anyone interested in WWII.  This could be the best personal memoir of combat ever written.  If you want a full appreciation of what the generation of Americans who endured WWII combat went through, buy this book now.<br />Sledge takes the reader with him as he joins the Marine Corp, goes through boot camp, and ends up with the grizzled combat veterans of the 1st Marine Division.  He takes us through his initiation of combat on Peleliu, a coral island which had some of the worst fighting, up to that point, in the Pacific.  Today, there is a general belief that the battle for Peleliu was unnecessary, owing to the advancement of the schedule for the invasion of the Philippines.  If this was an unneeded battle, Sledge shows in full detail the horrible sacrifice young Americans suffered.<br />His account of the battle of Okinawa is even more devasting.  Where Peleliu was a dry, parched hell, Okinawa is a hell of rain, mud, muck and decay.  Sledge is unstinting in exposing the horror and ever-present danger facing those in the frontlines.  He shows the casual brutality of combat, and does not turn away from showing the hatred most Marines had for the Japanese. He shows the close bonds that develop between the members of a combat unit, the terror of shell-shocked soldiers, dodging bullets &amp; shells on stretcher bearer duty, the stench of fighting in the middle of human decay, and the loss that is felt when friends die.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is mandatory reading for anyone interested in WWII.
0393312836|5.0|If you've seen any of my other reviews, youve noticed that I'm always discussing symbolism or political allegories.  That's right, this is such a book.  Even if all the symbolism and hype was removed from this book and it's name, it would still be an excellent book.  It moves with action and makes you sympathize with the anti-hero.  I can't think of any other book where I found myself rooting for the salvation of a rumbling, raping, vicious thug.  On a deeper level,(uh-oh, here comes the philosophy), this book represents a myriad of things.  In example, the tendency of human nature to be violent and unruly until age makes it's effect and gives knowledge and understanding; or an overall mellowing out.  Furthermore, the book is representative of cold war tactics used by both superpowers.  This book makes it onto my list as one of my highest recommended books
B00004XQP4|3.0|Am I the only one that doesn't want my favorite bands to grow up and explore other styles?  Like U2, REM and the Cure, Greenday is exploring their innerselves, forgetting that it was their very talented selves that brought them here.  &quot;I will follow&quot; to &quot;Zooropia&quot;,  &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; to &quot;Airportman&quot;,  &quot;Boys don't cry&quot; to &quot;Where the birds always sing&quot;, &quot;Basketcase&quot; to &quot;Misery&quot;.  My hope is Greenday always remembers what defined them.<br />Cue up the previous Greenday discs and you're rocking for 30 minutes.  Greenday is a rocking, guitar driven band.  Throw them in a garage with a beer and let's do some business.<br />Greenday Warning is a warning to all you aspiring rockers that more time in the studio, doesn't always equal better music. I guess they didn't like the &quot;punk&quot; label.<br />&quot;Minority, Church on Sunday, and Deadbeat Holiday&quot; are good, Greenday songs and &quot;Hold on&quot; and &quot;Waiting&quot; are very Beatlesesque, which I found neat.  Chicks dig the slow song, so, of course, you have to throw in &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;.<br />With Minority as the first single, no doubt this is going to make money and certainly the disc is unmistakenly Greenday, albeit Greenday-lite.  <br />If you're buying this to superglue into your multi-disc player expecting a guitar-punk rocker, you'll be disappointed.
068484267X|4.0|\\"When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: The happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\"   Experiencing this life of Frank McCourt through the novel Angela's Ashes was fascinating. McCourt's perception of events and people was amusing and clever. It was especially interesting seeing what the world and its actions appeared to be to Frank McCourt.   In a memoir, like any piece of writing, it's important to have an opening sentence that intrigues the reader and is interesting. Frank McCourt definitely accomplished that. He begins the book with the sentence: \\"My mother and father should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born.\\" This leaves the reader with the question, why. Why should they have stayed in New York? What was it about where they moved that was so bad? Where did they move? In order to receive answers for these questions, you have to read on. By the time you receive answers, you are hooked on the book and most definitely will continue reading.   It's also important to establish a clear setting so the reader can picture where the action is happening. I had a remarkably clear image in my mind of his many houses. I could also almost feel what it might have been like to be in the house, what the mood was. This is as important as being able to clearly see the setting.   The one thing Frank McCourt lacked when he wrote this novel was knowing how to end his story. There were a lot of extra stories that he told towards the end of the book that made it go on just a little to long. The actual ending, the last thing that happened, was quite good, however.   Angela's Ashes was an entertaining telling of McCourt's difficult childhood. Although it was a miserable Irish Catholic childhood, McCourt did survive it and retold it with wit and sincerity.
6305949980|5.0|&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; is, of course, a fine film (though in my opinion, some of the Elfman songs get a bit overly operatic) but this presentation is just amazing.  It's essentially everything that was included in the Laserdisc Deluxe Boxed set from a few years back, plus a &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; trailer.<br />The biggest bonus on the disc is the addition of Burton's two short films, &quot;Vincent&quot; and &quot;Frankenweenie.&quot;  &quot;Vincent&quot; is even closer than &quot;Nightmare&quot; at being the ideal film materialization of an Edward Gorey poem, and it's rarely been seen anywhere else. Not to mention the storyboards, commentary track, behind-the-scenes footage, trailers, deleted scenes (which are few in number, as animation is kept to a necesary minimum)...  And this from Disney, a company usually known for gouging DVD buyers with barebones &quot;features.&quot;  Keep it up, Dis.
0811826848|3.0|This is a somewhat disturbing book.  It tends to glorify the Beatles, in a way that has not been done since the 1960's.  I am not sure John would be a big fan for this reason.  He distanced himself from this kind of thing years before his death.  In fact, one might argue that this is the kind of thing that attracts people to the band.  Overall though I did like it quite a bit and would recommend it to those who know little or nothing about the greatest rock band in the history of western civilization.

B00004XQP4|5.0|In my opinion, the best Greenday CD yet.  They sound very similar to both Nirvana and They Might Be Giants, oddly.  Still, a great CD.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I found Fight Club to be an excellent movie, as the title of my review suggests. Although ultraviolent, this movie is also well crafted with spot on direction. It's also a visually stunning movie with cleverly interweaved effects. This aspect of the movie is too often ignored. I should say however that I was a little disturbed by the overall message. I happen to like Ikea furniture with its always fashionable Scandinavian design.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Great CD, although it's not punk it shows the band has evolved musically and sentimentally. Some catchy tunes, some punk, some pop make this album a good one, but not as good as dookie. It might even sound like the beatles sometimes. Well i liked it a lot and i hope you'll like it too! Definitely buy it!
B00004SCX6|2.0|She croons the album title, &quot;Oops I did it again&quot; with a fake sincerity.  I should say this of the whole album.  <br />There is missing a sincerity and intelligence that was definitely audible on her first album.  Before her lyrics had force and what gave it that was its ambiguity, its unwillingness to tow the line.  The old Brittany would never have given into corporate pressure or public opinion.  So no she did not do it again.<br />She seems to be more selfish than ever with words that refer always to herself.  That's usually okay, but she has lost some picture of who she really is.  Who is the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;I did it again&quot;?  Clearly it's not the &quot;me&quot; in &quot;Baby, hit me one more time.&quot;<br />I was disppointed with this album, though I believe in her.  I believe that she can see what she has become and learn that she has lost that wiseful innocence and become privy to something less.  Though I must admit there were a couple songs that made me cry.
0811826848|5.0|I had my reservations at first, but upon further reflection this the definitive Beatles book.  If you don't know anything about the Beatles (or even if you do) this is the one book you should have. My prior reservations were way off.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This was an idea that should never have worked. How do you combine a heavy-metal band (despite the transition, Metallica is still first and foremost a metal band) with a symphony? They are totally different. Yet it works. The San Francisco symphony is not there to compete with Metallica, they are there to complete Metallica. There are just things you can do, melodies and counter-melodies that you can develop with a 100 piece symphony that cannot be physically done by four people.<br />I am not a long-time fan. I was still in diapers when Kill 'Em All came out. I was 5 when Master did. S&amp;M was my first real exposure to Metallica. I am now beginning my attempts to get all their albums (starting with master, of course).<br />This was an insane idea, to mix two totally different mssical groups. That Metallica's work could be &quot;symphonized&quot; speaks volumes about the musical quality of their work. You will never see Korn do a performance like this because their work lacks musical merit (not knocking Korn, but from a pure musical standpoint they're just not that good). The only way this could work is if Metallica understands not just how the instruments are played, but what music theory is. As a pianist for seven years and a trombonist for six, I know what music theory is, and I can recognize it when others understand it. Metallica understands music. They understand chord progression, development of melody, melodic contrast, musical forms. The only reason this CD works is because Metallica makes true music, not just noise. This is a group that understands what music truly is, just in a different from from Mozart or Beethoven.<br />This album shows that while music can take many forms, the fundamentals of music apply as much to a symphony as they do to a heavy metal band, and the two can even unite with wondrous results.
B00004U2A1|4.0|This review refers to the Limited Edition, the version that comes in the overlarge collector's tin that is too big to fit in any normal DVD case.<br />Anyone considering purchasing the LE ought to know what they are getting into.<br />Evil Dead 2: DBD is a wonderful send-up of the slasher/moster horror genre.  The film's virtues could take up all 1000 words of the review, so suffice to say that Raimi and Campbell made a wonderful piece of work here, especially considering how it was shot and the budget on which it was created.<br />Now, for the dirt on the LE DVD.<br />The metal tin, although cool, is huge.  About three inches taller than a normal DVD case, and about two inches thick, it won't fit in a holder, and will look really out of place next to your other discs.  The cover art is awesome (it was used for the British version of the movie poster, which is re-created on a mini-poster inside, a &quot;poster&quot; roughly the size of a postcard).  The movie and sound transfers are not great, but considering what they had to work with, I think they did the best they could.  The final complaint about the packaging is that the disc itself is in a cheap jewel-case you place in a little niche in the tin.  Sorry, but they could have found a more aesthetically pleasing way to package such an expensive disc.<br />The &quot;Gore the Merrier&quot; feature will appeal mainly to fans interested in how the many creature and blood effects were made.  It runs about a half-hour, and is educational, but more of a &quot;sneak-preview showcase&quot; of making monsters than an actual &quot;how-to class.&quot;<br />The video game preview is a joke; it doesn't show anything you can't download off the web anyway, and the quality is so bad, you feel the urge to squint because it is so fuzzy at times.  Thankfully, game previews usually look nothing like the final products, so there is some hope for this (groovy-looking) Alone-In-The-Dark, Resident Evil clone.<br />The gem of this DVD is the commentary track.  Raimi and Campbell have never disappointed in their commentary on other discs, and they follow up nicely here as well.  I wonder why there wasn't two tracks, as there was on the Army of Darkness LE and the Evil Dead Special Edition, but I'm not going to complain too loudly, as the commentary here is almost worth what they are charging for this disc. (Everything's alright now!)<br />All in all, casual fans might want to stick with the regular edition.  The Limited Edition is pretty much only for collectors.  If you want a copy of this DVD, though, better act quickly, because once they are gone, the price-gougers on eBay will start their work.he commentary track.

B000021Y77|3.0|I think that the music kept this movie moving. I see the picture as an accompaniment to the soundtrack. They enchanche each other. I see this movie as a reeeally long music video. Don't get the dubbed version get the one with the subtitles. Hear the actors voices even if you dont know what they are saying. THis is not to say that the movie does not have other virtues. It probably does.
0553213105|5.0|First of all, let me start out by saying, I love this book! I'm 17 years old and Pride and Prejudice has been my favorite book for years. It was the first work of Jane Austen's that I had ever read and it prompted me to read her others. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice and Emma are her two very best. Her characters are so well-developed that you feel like you actually know them. Elizabeth in P&amp;P is an amazing and intelligent young woman. She has so much spirit that it's admirable.  Darcy is intelligent as well and he has a self-confidence that makes him very attractive.  The plot is always moving, always interesting. I've read P&amp;P so many times and I never get bored. Everyone should have this book.
B00004XMVH|5.0|I watch movies because I want to see some great acting, a solid plot, and fine-tuned action, not to learn about history. U-571 delivers on all three and is probably the best submarine flick since Das Boot. Watch it for the movie itself, not because of how it falsifies history.
B00004XONN|1.0|Give me a break.  This is not heady, atmospheric brilliance.  This is trite, meaningless mmuuuzzzzzaaccc.  Years from now this will be remembered as...... oh, that's right, it won't be remembered at all.
B0000057C5|4.0|Rammstein sounds very agressive, and that's probably what gave them popularity...Personnaly, I don't understand german a lot...So rare are the things I understand in their music...Some people told me it was very violent and disgusting, and others told me it was plain stupid...well I don't know who I should believe, so I only judge their music. The guitars sound like heavy weaponry...that's what I like the most in Rammstein...then, the singer has a strong voice, and that's cool too...and then comes the pretty cheap techno aspect, which could be better...the techno arrangements are so simple it's bad...but overall, their music sounds good and would put a the nicest hippie in a violent mood...that's their goal, probably...The best songs now...It starts with Sehnsucht, which is a good but repetitive song...then the beautiful Engel, with a very nice woman's voice...after that, there's also Du Hast, which is the heaviest one on the album, and Buck Dich, which is also very heavy...then there's Eifersucht, and the hidden track Stripped...Rammstein sounds German, but what I disliked is that it sounds American German, if you know what I mean...the little USA touch is a wound in their music, and that's sad...Overall, a very good album, for people who like agressive music but maybe you should look out for Herzeleid, their other CD...
B000002ORM|5.0|I love this soundtrack! We play it for our feild show, and it is the best! The movie is alright, but the music is great.
B00004XONN|4.0|Brilliant arrangements.  Mediocre songs (well, who can tell?).  They could have called this one 'Successful Experiments' - what they tried worked.  I like it because I like Radiohead, and they've got that electronic music thing *down*.  But people who really like obvious music would only give this album 3 stars.  My biggest concern is that the band stay together for another album, because there's a good chance the next one is going to take what's on this album into the realms of pure pop beauty.  In the meantime, this Radiohead fan is really happy with this.
B00004XQP4|5.0|As a fan of Green Day since the beginning in 1990 when they took out there punk rock album &quot;1039/smoothed put slappy hours&quot; I  got to knew every stuff they took out in real time.  The CD is a perfect demonstration of how this West Coast &quot;punks&quot; matured with time, and how they also changed there style, and best of all, how they continue being so GREAT.  About Warning, it is a complete CD including songs from the excellent single Melodic-punk:Minority , to the &quot;time of your life-ish&quot; ballad MACYS DAY PARADE. As Billie Joe (leader)said  before &quot;WE have a lot of The Beatles&quot; and this album shows this a lot. My advice, If you are a fan you must buy and if you never heard of this band or just thought they were a bunch of punks kids, well this is your time to buy the album.
B00004YM0D|3.0|I just got home from the movie and there were some songs I heard that I was really hoping would be on the soundtrack.  But no.  It was a great movie, and it IS a great soundtrack but it is such a let down when these movie people include songs in the movie but not the soundtrack.  So 3 is my final choice.
B00000JFV9|5.0|I guess the only thing to argue is whether Superfly or Shaft was the better album soundtrack from the era of blaxploitation films.   Either way, this is a great piece of music.  Curtis Mayfield had a musical career which spanned decades, and moved from the gospel roots of the Impressions to the soundtrack of a movie which glorified drug dealing.  Social sensibilities aside, it is hard to say anything bad about this music.  Curtis' voice was sweet and plaintive in songs like \\"Eddie, you Should've Known Better\\", and \\"Little Child, Running Wild\\".  Of course, he is like a one man Greek Chorus, as his songs tell of the strife which the movie characters face with their life's choices.  Songs like \\"Superfly\\" and of course Freddie's Dead let us know via the radio what was happening on the screen.  This album is still as fresh today as it was 25 years ago.
0800132343|5.0|This is not a blockbuster action film, nor an action packed war movie. It is a REAL WAR movie. When the crew is scared, your scared. When the crew is bored, you are bored. When the crew gets out of a bad situation, you cheer with them. This is the greatest war movie ever made. Everything feels and sounds real. Watch this movie, especially the ending, and you'll never want to join a war. Ever.
B00004TFK3|4.0|I was really excited about getting this DVD, but once I got it I wasn't AS much impressed. Don't get me wrong, its a great movie, but some of the features it promised really are not that great. The best part of the DVD besides the movie is being able to see Tommy and Barry MST3k style for visual commentary. Other interesting items is a video about Men in Black and some trailers. Great movie, but not quite too much stuff, even though it comes on 2 discs :).
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is definatly the best, and most entertaining movie EVER Tim is so  hot!!!!!
B000002HAJ|5.0|...but I've heard it many times since and it's still pretty damn good.<br />Not because the songs were played on the radio a lot...Or because some idiot who writes for Rolling Stone liked it.  <br />&quot;High&quot; is the only song that I can think of that is both happy and sad at the same time.<br />&quot;Doing the Unstuck&quot; might be the best song never played on the radio.  There's a lot going on there.<br />&quot;A Letter to Elise&quot; reminds me of college chicks.<br />But why the hell do you care what I think about it?  You don't know me from anybody...what do I know?<br />Listen and decide for yourself.
1573225517|4.0|High Fidelity has one of the best opening chapters I've read. Rob Fleming is recently single and making a list: The Top Five women (in chronological order) who've broken his heart. It's an incredible way to begin a novel and Mr. Hornby has you instantly hooked. And as you are drawn deeper and deeper into the main character's life, the lists abound: 'Top 5 Side One Tracks of All Time' (does Beethoven's 5th symphony count?), 'Top 5 80's Movies with Molly Ringwald' (did Molly Ringwald even make 5 movies in the 80's?), and on ... And the entire time, the reader is slowly let in on the secret: Rob Fleming is thirtysomething, owns a record store, and has no life.<br />Make no mistake about it - though this is an intensely amusing and very well written (not to mention very British) novel, you will not necessarily like the main character. Hopefully, you'll also not be able to relate to him in too many ways. You will, however, be intrigued. You will laugh, question, and wonder. And then, you'll finish, take a step back and think &quot;This better not happen to me...&quot;
B000031WBV|5.0|Let's talk about what a real artist can do with great, sublime music. It should be an effortless rendering that the heart hears now and the mind contemplates later.

6302426499|5.0|Andrei Rublev is not only one of the most difficult films to describe, it is also one of the most beautiful films ever made.  It flows like a long Russian novel, with interworking subplots and interwoven themes.  The rich fiction created by Konchalovsky and Tarkovsky, based on the late medieval Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev, raises many important questions concerning life, the soul, and art.  Above all, there is something elegantly and radiantly lyrical about the film, scene by scene.  The film itself is divided into vignettes, or what I like to refer to as chapters, recounting different periods in Rublev's life; each one could be its own film, namely the last section about the bell and the young bellmaker.  However, the most poetic scenes involve the Holy Fool, or Durochka, played by Tarkovsky's wife Irma Raush.  Her character adds a touchingly humorous, yet tender aspect to the film; her relationship with Rublev is so sweet and almost childlike, it brings a true smile to your face. Throughout the film, Tarkovsky is able to catch the incredibly earth-shattering expressions on the character's faces, symbolzing oppression from war and Tatar raids, poverty and inequality.  One simple look of an eye speaks a thousand words in this film.  The vignette entitled The Jester displays some of the most wonderful examples of the human condition ever in film; the beating rain on the primitive hut combined with the tired, worn out, wretched faces of the peasants (including children, men, women, and elderly), is so realistic you can taste it.  Tarkovsky is indeed a modern master, and Andrei Rublev is quite possibly his masterpiece.  Tarkovsky's work ranks with so many of the great modern artists, not filmmakers, but painters and photographers:  Cartier-Bresson, Freud, Picasso, Matisse, O'Keefe, Stieglitz, etc. Anchoress, a film obviously influenced by Andrei Rublev, particularly in cinematography, is recommended also for anyone who enjoys intellectually and visually impressive cinema.

B00000IL29|5.0|Herbie Hancock reaffirmed his importance in modern Jazz history with this stunning album.  Hancock always is a pioneer of Jazz music, and this album takes him to another level of Piano brilliance.  Using outstanding musicians as backup compliments this album.  With Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and Saxophonist George Colman, Hancock explores each and every song on here with different rythmic spacing, and musical influences from Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman and even Art Blakey.  Hancock isn't afraid to go for a new sound and we are all gratefull to this Jazz pioneer.  From &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; to &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; each and every song on this album (CD) is a delight to listen too.  Blue Note recordings did an excellent job of letting Hancock explore and the Jazz world is gratefull for it.  Highly recommended!
B00004U2HK|5.0|The breathtaking Alps, lakes and grassy slopes welcome you into the charming land of Austria. The wide open spaces give an instant sense of freedom. The scenes are set in Salzburg, Austria in the 30's.  Suddenly you will see a grassy slope and Maria (Julie Andrews) bursts onto the screen with her childlike joy and sweet innocent nature. Her soul lives to be free, her arms stretch out (as in the cover picture) as she swirls around singing as only a person who is a child at heart can. Suddenly she realizes she has wandered far, far away from the Abbey.  The nun's know Maria all too well and start a discussion about why they love her so much. \\"She's always late for everything except for every meal.\\"  Maria seems to be fighting her innermost desire to be free and it is very apparent she is not well suited for the calling. Her Mother Superior sets her free to follow her heart by helping her to see the need to accept a position of Governess to \\"seven\\" children.<br /><br />\\"You have to live the life you were born to live.\\" --Mother Superior<br /><br />Soon the children have learned to sing, frolic with life and completely exasperate their father who discourages any sign of fun. Once he leaves for a visit in Vienna, the children get to go on picnics, bike rides, train rides and other fun adventures. Laughter is in every scene and singing is the focus.<br /><br />When their father, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a lonely widower tries to introduce a haughty Baroness to them, they are not at all impressed. So the stage is set for humor, love, happiness, sadness, fear, jealousy, deceit, romance and adventure. The chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reaches its height in a beautiful Austrian folk dance. The tension mounts and the Baroness appears.  She has truly evil intentions for Maria and the children, who she would just as well send off to boarding school.<br /><br />In the first half of the movie, life is pleasant and follows an upbeat theme. In the second half, you will have trouble not crying all the way to the end. Happiness can sometimes make you cry as well. You can literally feel the invincible human spirit rising in you as you celebrate the family's daring flight from Nazi rule. Only a true story could be this inspirational. I truly cannot watch this movie without wanting to sing along with at least half the songs. Julie Andrews voice is magical. If you appreciate impeccable acting, breathtaking scenery, and a feeling of true romance....call me sentimental, but you will love this movie. The only thing which saddens me is that some people are truly too jaded to appreciate the beauty in this movie. I guess I still have the child in me that wants to believe in a fairy tale, yet this was based on a true story, and perhaps real life is the best story of all.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewwill have trouble not crying all the way to the end.

B00004SCX6|4.0|It took me a while to finally get hooked on this cd.  This cd is really good.  It's not the best cd in the world, but it's a lot of fun.  It's got some really good pop songs (What You See, Lucky, Oops) and some good ballads (Dear Diary &amp; Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know).  The only thing it really needs is Britney to stop being so nasally.  Her voice would sound so much better if she didn't sound as whiny in her songs.  If you love fun pop songs, then this cd is definitely for you.
B00004RFFM|1.0|I spent most of this film in a state of total disbelief, feeling I had blundered into an old set for the Poseidon Adventure .        What on earth were the Aquatica sharks made of? They gleamed like lovingly polished Ferraris in a car show room, and on occasion moved as if the controls had seized and stuck on fast forward. The cer-unch ce-runch of the manequins being eaten...the shot of the shark in the last reel...;  seriously bad.    \\"Jaws\\" doesn't have a thing to worry about.<br />      Best line: \\"You ate mah bird\\".
B00000JCB2|5.0|wow i was amazed by how much fred durst had changed from huge rage to normal standards of rage. this cd is awesome once again wes borland has shown us he is the king at guitar playing like in the song just like this i was amazed, and fred durst has changed a little but that hasn't bothered their music. the songs i like on this cd r just like this, nookie, break stuff, n 2 gether now, trust, and show me what you got so check those out. the songs on this cd r so addictive i mean sometimes i would put it in my cd player and repeat some of the songs over and over again its amazing how a band can make 2 awesome cds in a row. once again if u like awesome guitar playing, rap hard rock and great lyrics significant other is the cd to buy. trust me this one is another great rap hard rock cd.
B000002C1V|5.0|Most people believe that Final Cut`` is simply an a solo of Roger Waters(wrong!). Final Cut have the power on the solo guitar by the god David Gilmour and the bango jim (Nick Mason). The songs: Fletcher Memorial Home, Final Cut, Not Now John! and even Two Suns In The Sunset is the combination of sounds and compositios at their best!.
B000001Y42|5.0|this cd is awesome it has awesome guitar playing done by wes borland(who in my opinion is the best guitar player right now) and the way fred durst expresses his rage in some of his songs r just plain awesome. my favorite songs on this cd r pollution, counterfeit, faith, and leech. u should check those songs out. this cd puts together awesome guitar playing and great lyrics to me if u like rap,hard/rock type of music u should defintely buy this cd u wont be dissapointed.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Allright, so Eddie, Stone, Jeff, Mike and Matt are no John, Paul, George and Ringo.. This album is a big dissapointment after listening to something as strong and sound-filled as &quot;Yield&quot;.  This reminds me of listening to No Code after having enjoyed &quot;Vitalogy&quot; as much as I did. Light Years and Insignificance are strong original PJ tunes, but the rest is fruitless.. I'd rate this album slightly higher than No Code, but not much.  Too bad I bought PJ Tour tickets before I got a chance to listen to Binaural.. I'd be doing something else on Halloween otherwise.
B000009ED0|4.0|this cd is a great head banger cd bawittiba, cowboy, i am the bullgod, devil without a cause, f**k off r my favorite songs. in f**k off that song is strange because its not really rock but is addictive and bawittiba very good song cowboy adiictive i am the bullgod is a cool song devil without a cause and entertaining song. this cd u have to have it i mean hard rock wouldn't be complete without kid rock and hes been around a long time if like rap rock this is a must have for head bangers out there.
B00004XONN|2.0|All right... enough about Kid A being the greatest album by Radiohead. This doesn't even compare to the Bends or OKC. I've been amazed in reading all the reviews that almost everyone is in love with this album. I think right now people like it because they are supposed to. Kinda like the Messiah at Christmas. Everyone likes it, but it is two hours of the same song over and over. It's Radiohead, it's different, I have to like it. let's be pragmatic. gone is what Radiohead does best. Create a mood of melancholy through haunting guitars, piano, vocals. In are the newly synthesized sounds that any knowledgeable person could make if they had the time and money to invest while in a studio. And no, this is not the logical direction stemming out of OKC. It's the sound of we need an album to get more money and we know the fans will buy it. Hopefully a real album will be coming out soon. And, if you're searching for a mood album/concept album that you have to listen to in its entirety, get Spiritualized's &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen....&quot; Much better, richer, and fuller. All I can say is that I hope that this is not the future of Radiohead. You can't run from your past like this, and the past of Radiohead is pure and haunting great rock.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|this cd has some good songs but it really isn't hard rock and rap like i expected it to be the only real rap and rock song is guerrila radio it has great lyrics and good background music but overall it isn't that bad its just not that addictive but if u like rap and rock that is not really that hard u should get this cd.
B00004XONN|2.0|All right... enough about Kid A being the greatest album by Radiohead. This doesn't even compare to the Bends or OKC. I've been amazed in reading all the reviews that almost everyone is in love with this album. I think right now people like it because they are supposed to. Kinda like the Messiah at Christmas. Everyone likes it, but it is two hours of the same song over and over. It's Radiohead, it's different, I have to like it. let's be pragmatic. gone is what Radiohead does best.

B00004SCX6|1.0|Britney is the worst singer! This cd shows that she cannot sing. Her TALENTLESS singing vocals TRY to improve by letting her background singers sing louder than her. Her voice is also drowned away by the musical instruments, as if they are trying to cover up her bad vocals. The background music is louder than her voice, which tricks the audience into thinking that she can sing. After listening thru 12 tracks of this cd, her voice got soooooo annoying! She sounds like ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS. She has a nasally, baby voice.She sounds like a little girl and she's only 18!  When she sings the song Stronger, her voice DOESNT get any stronger..it stays weak the whole time, while her background music is the one that gets stronger! Her voice doesnt sound mature.You can obviously tell that that the studio-recording made her voice HIGHER than her real, natural singing voice because when she does actually sing in live concerts (that is, when she isn't lip-sync), her voice is actually LOW. YES, the music has catchy-fun dance beats to it, but most of the songs sound the SAME. The song OOps..! sounds like What You See is What You Get and compare her songs CRAZY, BABY1MORETIME,OOPS IDIDITAGAIN,STRonger &lt;--all these songs sound like each other, same beat, same instruments,same arrangement of music, there's  NOTHING new in britney's music, even her lyrics..check out Stronger..the lyrics say &quot;my loneliness ain't killing me no more.&quot; Some ppl are already fed up with listening to Baby1MoreTime's &quot;my loneliness is killing me&quot;...B1MT got old, so why is she bringing it back in the song Stronger!Can she please be creative!If you take out the background music, her dancing, her looks, all you have left is her voice...TRY to imagine her singing an ACCAPELLA ballad ...SHE CAN'T DO IT!Imagine her 10yrs from now, she still cant sing.A diva is one that doesn't need to dance,look &quot;pretty&quot; or wear sexy clothes..all a diva needs is a powerful voice and thats why theyare truly called DIVA singers. Britney is opposite of a diva, she wears sexy clothes and dances to DISTRACT the audience into not focusing on her vocals...instead you would focus on her appearance.I know some people that can sing more powerful than brit but aren't even famous. Her music sounds like the 80's and this is the 90s/2000s! Her music will get very old and outdated. Her lyrics need to change..I can see why little kids like brit..listen to the lyrics &quot;This is a story of a girl named lucky; Dear Diary&quot;. She needs to take voice lessons cuz She sounds like she can only sing 3notes higher not an octave, all this cd is a bunch of brit groaning and sounds like she's hiccuping at the end of each note. Because she can't sing she usually lip-sincs in concerts and dances..but even if the dances are good, thats all she does is dance and lip-sinc.She's probly afraid of using her natural voice that's why she lip-syncs all the time.Why then, is she a singer if all she does is dance and lip-sinc!Brit, why do you call yourself a singer if all you do is dance!You're NOT a DANCER, you consider yourself a SINGER not vice versa. But Yes, this cd is better than her first. ~This is my opinion~.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is great. The band has a lot of good albums, but this is their best. It's got a couple of good songs, but the ones that I like best are #3, #6 and #10. Song #6 and #11 are so great that they make you want to do something. All the songs sound different in a different way. Some of the songs sound the same, but they're not exactly the same. Song #2 is the best song because it's the best song. I mean better then song #11, but not quite as good as song #5. I like this album because it's the kind of album that's likable in a different sort of way. If you like good music, then you've got to get this good album.
B00004W221|5.0|What a great movie. In movies today there are not to many wholesome family shows. This movie breaks the mold. It displays all the qualities i would want my child to learn. Qualities like endurance, self esteem, passion for the future and to never deture from your dreams. I would like to hear from any redblooded american who did not like Rudy!
B00000IAU3|5.0|This album means a lot to me since my grandmother died of cancer of the bowels. She went to doctor about a year ago, and the doctor said that she only had about six months to live. The songs remind me of the time that my husband walked out and left me with three kids, two dogs, and no car. I mean, how could anyone do such a terrible thing? Sure I got married when I was 17 because I was pregnant with my oldest son, Teevon, but I was in love just like these love songs.
0679746048|5.0|to give it a star-kind-rating feels out of place - certainly susanna kaysen is excellent at describing her period of mental illness, but what is more important are her insights or inspired guesses at the nature of the phenomenon - I decided not to go to the movie because I did not wish to destroy the feeling it left, of being earnest and of hilarious laughter the way it is described in books of zen-teachers.
0754053709|5.0|Of course, Irons played Charles Ryder in the now-classic 1982 television miniseries of &quot;Brideshead.&quot;  If you admired that, you must hear his performance of Waugh's unabridged text on this recording.  I listen to it every fall when the leaves are changing, just to revel in the language, appreciate a great acting performance, and to have my faith renewed.  When you listen to this, you will feel the &quot;twitch upon the thread.&quot;
B000002HJR|5.0|This is one of the truly great &quot;supergroup&quot; albums of all time.  While these projects usually pale in comparison to the individual bands that the members hail from, &quot;NOLA&quot; is in many ways greater than the sum of it's individual parts.  Comprised of Phil Anselmo (Pantera, superjoint ritual, christ inversion, etc..), Pepper Keenan (C.O.C.), Todd Strange (Crowbar), Kirk Windstein (Crowbar) and Jimmy Bower (Crowbar, Eye Hate God), NOLA is better than anything that these bands have ever put out.  In fact, NOLA may be the greatest &quot;heavy music&quot; album of all time.  The fact that it (in my humble opinion) eclipses all of the Pantera, C.O.C. and Crowbar CDs is saying something, as I love 'em all.  However, NOLA is so good it's scary.  Starting off with the immense &quot;temptation's wings&quot; through the finale of &quot;Bury me in smoke,&quot; NOLA burns with an intensity and conviction that makes most albums sound puny and contrived by comparison.  Phil's vocals and lyrics have never been better (...Good lord where are you found? Carry judgement on underground.  I hear you laughing out loud.  Should have changed my ways by now... from Swan Song is an example), and the southern death ride crunch of Keenan, Strange and Windstein is something that I think will never be repeated on record.  On top of all this Jimmy Bower's drumming is just awesome, hard and heavy, but unpolished, which would be a great way to describe this CD.  Mere Words do not suffice here, go out and buy NOLA today and become a &quot;Lifer&quot; with &quot;Eyes of the South&quot;.  Pray for locust, pray for locust.<br />Paul M.
B00000612P|5.0|Yes, Rod Stewart has been coasting for 20 years now.  But if you have never heard this album (inconceivable!) you're in for a shock.  Stewart combines toughness and tenderness in a way that illuminates most every young guy's experience.  The title track is a bit of autobiography that will send shivers down your spine; the protagonist is whipped from pillar to post and finally finds love, and is able to look back and laugh.  That's what we all want, and rarely has that universal experience been so elequently expressed (and it's splendid hard rock, too.)  Plus, the greatest version of Tim Hardin's &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; ever recorded.  And &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot; conveys an emotion that is almost impossible to find in yesterday's or today's rock: humility.  You *must* have this album.
B000002LLC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Madonna's - always have been, always will be.  But that doesn't mean that I'm not critical of her music or that I like everything she does.  But 'I'm Breathless' is one of her most whimsical, charming albums ever, and I think it shows what a lot of us know - but many don't - that Madonna is a talented singer/song writer who has a pretty wide range of capabilities.<br />As songs 'from' and 'inspired by' Dick Tracy, this album is full of music from another era, one that happily suits Madonna's voice and sense of humor.  Some of the music is plain silly, some is sexy, but it's all good, and among the slower numbers are a bunch of real toe-tappers - not typical Madonna dance music (although Vogue is on the CD), mind you.  Steven Sondheim wrote several of the songs, including the marvelous 'Sooner or Later,' and his music blends in well with Madonna's, making it really cohesive despite the normally very different styles of the songwriters.<br />All in all, this is a terribly fun CD, and one that's full of good, catchy songs.  Who would have thought that the Material Girl, who epitomized the '80s and '90s, could transport you back to the '40s?  This album is really for anyone - for people who love Madonna, for people who love this type of music or for people who just want a fun, different kind of album to that will entertain them.  Buy it!
B00003CWNR|5.0|Michael Caine portrays Dr. Larch who runs an orphanage.  He performs deliveries or abortions, depending on the wishes of his patients.  He arranges for adoptions and cares for those orphans who are not adopted.  One of the children, Homer Wells, becomes like a son to him and he trains him to succeed him at the orphanage.  Homer disapproves of the abortion end of Larch's business and decides to go out into the world to see new things.  He admits to his companions that he has never seen the ocean, nor has he seen a lobster, although he has spent his entire life in Maine.  Homer falls in love and learns about the good and evil side of the people with whom he comes in contact.  This is a wonderful movie with brilliant acting and a very moving story--the best I've seen in quite sometime.
0671578855|5.0|I have read all the Vorkosigan books and have loved each and every one (excepting Ethan of Athos). I LOVE Miles!! This one was a bit different from the others and to me the most fun to read. It was just plain enjoyable. I can't wait until Ms. Bujold releases the next one. My husband and I are both addicted and it is one of the few books we obtain in hard cover and as soon as it reaches the shelves.  Thank you Ms. Bujold for writing this book as well as all the others.
6300268993|4.0|This film gets 4 stars from me based on its extended version and not on the pathetic theatrical cut!  A lot of footage was cut from this film but did make it onto various extended versions that were screened across the world.  The theatrical cut of this film is a poor reflection on what director Richard Donner intended the world to see.  After his sacking by the Salkinds, Richard Lester was dragged in to complete the film and refilm perfectly filmed scenes which Donner filmed in 1977.  This decision cost everyone a great movie.<br />In 1984 fans finally got a well edited film when a lot of Donner's footage was re-inserted into TV broadcasts of the movie.  The longest version having accumalated some 24 mins of additional footage.  This version has only been screened in Europe and Australia and contains 7 mins more footage than the 1984 ABC telecast.  Most notable extended scenes are of Lex and Eve exploring the exterior of the fortress.  Miss T to Les, &quot;...It is funny that there is no front door...&quot;.  Also present is Superman's &quot;Blast off!&quot; line after Lex and the villains are taken away by the Arctic police.  These crucial scenes were cut from the theatrical and ABC extended broadcasts. <br />In saying that still, the film will get 5 stars when I see all director Richard Donner's footage restored into the film.<br />Anyone thinking that the theatrical is a good film is much mistaken.  Any of the extended TV broadcast are a MAJOR improvement over an average film!
B00004XQP4|5.0|On Warning, Green Day continues to evolve artisticly while maintaining the intensity that typifyed their first five albums. The standard three cord composition remains but like a good piece of minalamist art simplicity notes the removal of extranious noise. Accordions, mandolins and harmonicas are seemelesly intigrated for a sound that is both popy and complex.   I do not think many punk rockers will buy this album but I believe that bucking convention and formula and continuing to take chances after five succsesful albums shows that the band has yet to &quot;sell out&quot; to dumbed down pop tastes. I do miss the masturbation refrences and raging guitar of the earlier albums but I suppose my tastes are evolving and I don't need constent overstimulation to enjoy a record. This is perhaps the most compelling part of the album, it is brutally simple yet amazingly complex. Bille Joe on songs like Macy's Day Parade almost starts to sound like Sting. Unlike so many bands that tire out and release lifeless corprate rock after a promising start, Green Day continues to inovate and rock.
B00004XQP4|5.0|If you like Green Day then you have to buy this cd. Warning is there best cd ever.
B00004XONN|5.0|The album is an unprecedented work of brilliance the likes of which the mainstream music world has not seen since Dark Side of the Moon. Kid A is a bold and daring departure from all things conventional. Thom Yorke is clearly a man who understands that rock music as a genre has gone as far as it can without becoming redundant, which is why 99% of the rock out there today (ie. Creed, Matchbox 20, Three Doors Down) is uninspired [junk]. In Kid A, the last great rock band pushes the envelope of Rock n' Roll, and indeed music in general. The result is tranqulizing and awe inspiring. This album is every bit as good as OKC, if not better...If you are tired of the lack of artistic vision in today's music, then this album will be a breath of fresh air. If you like or respect ANY of the bands listed above, you WILL hate this album, so don't buy it....Mozart would have loved this!

B00001NFCY|1.0|Creed is the epitome of all that is wrong with music.  They are playing the same music that Alice in Chains was doing 10 years ago.  Their lyrics are mindless and uninspired,  and their taste in apparel ridiculous.  If you love these guys as much as they so obviously love themselves, I pity you...for you cannot be that into music.
0684853523|5.0|I can honestly say this is the first how-to book on writing I've ever read that tells it exactly like it is in no uncertain terms.  This is a book that's going to make a LOT of beginning writers very, very angry.  This is a book that's also going to make a lot of selling writers who aren't as famous as King very, very angry.  But this is also a book that's absolutely true, and that's the rarest and most precious thing of all in the world of writing.<br />This book is an open wound from beginning to end, and that's its strength.  It is NOT a book about writing horror, it's a book about what it takes to be a good writer in any genre, including the literary genre.  This is the ONLY how-to book I've ever read that doesn't make nice with the reader, that doesn't tell fairy stories to the wanna-be writer, that doesn't tell the midlist writer it's a matter of luck, or a matter of finding the right audience.  <br />A God Almighty lot of readers (Those who wish to be writers) are going to HATE this book with a passion, and after finishing it these same readers will go right back to not selling, to not writing enough, to not reading enough, to believing it's all luck, to believing they just haven't gotten the &quot;break&quot; they need, to believing that editors don't know good fiction when they see it, to believing all sorts of foolishness.<br />But for those who'll LISTEN, who'll forget their own ego, who'll swallow hard and do what this book says do, this book might very well let them walk with seven league boots and step into the world of a selling writer.<br />It sure as anything made me mad, made me feel about two inches tall, and made me seriously doubt my right to call myself a writer.  But it also made me want to write, want to tell the honest truth in my writing, made me see what good writing is, more than all the other books and articles I've read put together, and then multiplied by a factor of ten.<br />If you want to be a good writer, a selling writer, then youMUST read this book, and you MUST do as it says do.
B00004XONN|4.0|the best review i ever read on radiohead is -- 'you might not like/know radiohead, but your kids will.'<br />listen to it on headphones.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album certainly has achieved to a point of a supreme artwork, where it really has created a world out of itself. When listening to Kid A, the music has totally dragged me out from the real world, where my soul and the music become one. As a piece of art, this is perfect. And as an album, it has the introduction, the pitch and finally the end - it is like a journey, an experience. Kid A is a whole, it is not ten seperated tracks - and do not try to seperate them. Only ten different scenes have together created a beautiful and unique world of sound.  Do not hurry when listening to this album, Kid A will never be good, unless you have truly put yourself in the music.

B00003CXAA|5.0|&quot;The Godfather&quot; is the ultimate film experience.  Francis Ford Coppola gives us a rich story of honor, family, hard lessons and offers you can't refuse.  Beyond the intricate plotting which I think probably every mafia film requires, this film ultimately reveals itself as a stirring family drama.<br />Al Pacino stars as Michael Corleone, a sort of prodigal son of the family business.  He returns from World War II as a hero on his sister's wedding day and finds his family nearly embroiled in a no holds barred Mafia War.  The &quot;family&quot; patriarc; Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando), is a man who believes in family and loyalty.  He is one mafia don you want on your side as the infamous beheaded horse scene tells us.<br />The film finds it's stride once Michael assumes control of the family business, not for greed, money or power but for survival.  It is here where Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo present Michael in situations which tear at his soul.  Does he stand by his opinion of non-involvment of the family business as he states to his long suffering sweetheart Kaye (Diane Keaton) or does he embrace the ways of his father and save the Corleone family?<br />I find &quot;The Godfather&quot; closely related to another epic film released just a few years after; &quot;Star Wars&quot;.  The story arc of the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot; is very similar to what happens in just the first Godfather film.  Should Michael turn to the &quot;dark side&quot; and save his &quot;family/father&quot; from the inside?  I find it an interesting premise in both films knowing that Coppola and George Lucas have had a working experience before both films on &quot;American Graffti&quot;<br />&quot;The Godfather&quot; is expertly written, gloriously casted, and the acting is legendary as is the film.  For a richly rewarding viewing experience I highly recomend &quot;The Godfather&quot;, it's certainly a hard offer to refuse.
0780020685|5.0|I've seen nearly all of the Akira Kurosawa films such as Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress,Rashoman, Ran etc., but this one is far the best and that's saying a lot. There are several outstanding characters from the sage-like Kanbei to the brash Kikuchiyo. The fight scenes are realistic, not the normal hack and slash, but well planned out strategic events. It almost like they are choreagraphed dances than armed combat. Like the editoral reviewers stated earlier you have to watch the long version of this movie to fully appreciate it. If you want to own only one Kurosawa film, own this one.
B000002U6E|5.0|First of all you must listen &quot;Return To Innocence&quot;.It's an amazing single.It includes relaxing lyrics and tune. Also the &quot;Matrix&quot; theme (The Eyes Of Truth) is a powerful single.Now i understood why they use the eyes of truth in matrix trailer:-) I think the first Enigma cd (MCMXC a.D) is more relaxing and symphonic.But in this cd (The Cross Of Changes) lyrics are much more powerful. If you buy this cd you will like it!!!!!
0811826848|5.0|This long awaited brand new Beatles history contains 368 pages and more than 1,300 photos, many never seen before by the public.  It's loaded with personal stories from how the Beatles came to be, the early rough days, their rise to fame, the social changes they caused and how they finally broke up.  It's written as an autobiography, not a tabloid account of their lives we're so used to seeing.  This autobiography provides insight into their lives unlike many of the other accounts published.  Their tales are filled with humor and they mince no words about their lives and what they stood for.  Many of the photos and documents included are from their personal archives and have never been seen before by the public.  The Beatles make it clear that they would say what they really thought about the issues of their time and hoped others would be truthful and do likewise.  Their philosophy was &quot;everything that happens to you is good, as long as you learn something from the experience.&quot;  This is a MUST HAVE library volume for Beatles fans and something you'll enjoy, keep and refer to for a long time.  A great addition to the vast Beatles literature.
B00004W5UA|5.0|GENIUS! .... if it were even remotely possibly to capture the artistic brilliance of this cinematic masterpiece in a word (as feeble an attempt it may be), it would have to be CLEVER. One can not even begin to describe this film without failing to do it well-deserved justice.     Unjustly promoted as a typical Hollywood sell-out action flick, starring Brad Pitt, I never had any intention of seeing Fight Club. The only potential element of redemption I foresaw in it at all, was my appreciation for Edward Norton's extraordinary talent. Fearful of losing respect for Norton as an actor, I braved the potential cinematic disappointment after receiving a positive review from a respected movie buff friend of mine. Skeptically, I entered the theatre, unaware of what would prove to be significantly different from what I was led to expect. What instead unfolded before me was a divine delivery of unusually witty dialogue, biting dark humor, exceptional acting (surprisingly, even from Brad Pitt), hilariously insightful narration, a remarkably original script, phenomenal directing, ingenious filming and inventive imagery, as well as a wonderfully complimentary soundtrack, collectively juxtaposed in rare harmonic perfection. Cleverly shocking, Fight Club unravels as a brilliant satire of modern civilization as well as a disturbing poke at the mundaneness of a consumerist existence. Iconoclastic in it's portrayal of our cultural conventions and values, the philosophy entertained in this movie challenges our most basic beliefs and assumptions about reality. The bland and insignificant Jack, personifies repression and dissatisfaction with existence, while the irreverant and radically anarchistic enigma, Tyler Durden, personifies reckless freedom and intensity of experience. These dangerous extremes, on both personal and social levels (capitalism vs. fascism), are shown in a critical light. The riveting and refreshingly unpredictable plot leave intelligent viewers both amazed and bewildered, intensely satisfied with the quality of cinema displayed. As for the author, Jack Palahniuk, how is that working out for you, being clever?
0930289234|5.0|Comic books superheroes are basically fascist vigilantes, with Superman and his dedication to truth, justice and the American way being the exception that proves the rule.  Both &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns,&quot; the two greatest examples of graphic storytelling, deal explicitly with the underlying fear the ordinary citizenry have of the demi-gods they worship.  The one inherent advantage that &quot;Watchman&quot; has over Frank Miller's classic tale is that it requires no knowledge of the existing mythos of its characters because Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, the Comedian and the rest of the former members of the Crimebusters.<br />The brainchild of writer Alan Moore (&quot;Swamp Thing,&quot; &quot;V for Vendetta,&quot; &quot;From Hell&quot;) and artist Dave Gibbons (&quot;Rogue Trooper,&quot; &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; &quot;Green Lantern&quot;), &quot;Watchmen&quot; was originally published by DC Comics in twelve issues in 1986-87.  Moore and Gibbons won the Best Writer/Artist combination award at the 1987 Jack Kirby Comics Industry Awards ceremony.  The central story in &quot;Watchmen&quot; is quite simple: apparently someone is killing off or discrediting the former Crimebusters.  The remaining members end up coming together to discover the who and the why behind it all, and the payoff to the mystery is most satisfactory.  But what makes &quot;Watchmen&quot; so special is the breadth and depth of both the characters and their respective subplots: Dr. Manhattan dealing with his responsibility to humanity given his god-like powers; Nite Owl having trouble leaving his secret identity behind; Rorschach being examined by a psychiatrist.  Each chapter offers a specific focus on one of the characters, yet advances the overall narrative.<br />Beyond that the intricate narrative, Moore and Gibbons offer two additional levels to the story.  First, each chapter is followed by a &quot;non-comic&quot; section that develops more of the backstories, such as numerous excerpts from Hollis Mason's autobiography &quot;Under the Hood&quot; or Professor Mitlon Glass' &quot;Dr. Manhattan: Super-Powers and the Superpowers,&quot; an interview with Adrian Veidt, or reports from the police files of Walter Joseph Kovacs.  Second, almost every issue has scenes from &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter,&quot; a comic-book being read by a kid near a newsstand, which offers an allegorical perspective on the main plot line.<br />&quot;Watchmen&quot; certainly nudged the comics industry in the right direction towards greater sophistication and intelligence, although a full appreciation of its significance is always going to be lost on the bean counters.  The Book Club Edition of &quot;Watchmen&quot; offers the teaser: &quot;He's America's ultimate weapon . . . and he's about to desert to Mars.&quot;  As a representation of the work as a whole that description is simply stupid, especially since it is followed by a glowing recommendation by Harlan Ellison that concludes &quot;anyone who misses this milestone event in the genre of the fantastic is a myopic dope.&quot;  If you ever spent time reading and enjoying any superhero comic book, you will appreciate what you find in &quot;Watchmen.&quot;lops more of the backstories, such as numerous excerpts from Hollis Mason's autobiography &quot;Under the Hood&quot; or Professor Mitlon Glass' &quot;Dr. Manhattan: Super-Powers and the Superpowers,&quot; an interview with Adrian Veidt, or reports from the police files of Walter Joseph Kovacs.

B00004X01U|4.0|&quot;Music&quot; is a schizophrenic record, just like all Madonna albums: It brings together seemingly polar opposites and shows what they have in common.  Madonna's previous attempts at uniting antagonists have typically been thematic rather than sonic--for example, the saint/whore of &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; the sensual ice queen of &quot;Erotica,&quot; the savvy fool of &quot;Beautiful Stranger.&quot;  On her new album, though, Madonna shoves together two radically different musical genres--electronic dance and folk music--and explores their similarities--namely, simple, repetitive melodies; yearning, encouraging lyrics; and unabashed optimism laced with a dark side.  (Bjork fans will recall how she similarly blended techno and classical music on her 1997 album &quot;Homogenic.&quot;)<br />The most obvious example of this &quot;electronic folk dance music&quot; is &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; which starts with a series of rollicking acoustic guitar licks that get strangely clipped off before the end of the phrase, then segues into a squeaky, drum-laden track with the guitar passages inserted as accompaniment to the electronic backbone of the song.  In other words, Madonna uses the guitar refrain not as the main structure of the song, as in a traditional folk tune, but instead samples the refrain, cutting it off and fitting it neatly like a puzzle piece into the rest of the synthesizer-driven song, where it makes sense and sounds perfectly appropriate.<br />Not that this technique of squashing together folk and electronica always works so well on &quot;Music.&quot;  The ballads &quot;I Deserve It&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot; are simple, enjoyable enough folk tunes on their own; but Madonna laces them with bizarre, ear-shattering synthesizer blasts that have nothing to do with the songs, apparently in an attempt to make them sound avant-garde.<br />But that doesn't mean Madonna should have scrapped the electronica and stuck with her acoustic guitar.  Madonna is no folkie at heart--dance music is still her forte--and the best songs on &quot;Music&quot; are the dizzying, racing, pure dance numbers--&quot;Music,&quot; &quot;Impressive Instant,&quot; &quot;Runaway Lover,&quot; and &quot;Amazing.&quot;  The laid-back tunes--&quot;I Deserve It,&quot; &quot;Nobody's Perfect,&quot; &quot;Gone&quot;--are catchy enough, but often saddled with babyishly simple lyrics (sample from &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;: &quot;I feel so bad/What I did wasn't right/I feel so sad/And I must say to you/Sorry, but/Nobody's perfect.&quot;)<br />Despite the limitations of &quot;Music&quot;'s folkier tunes, it's nice to see Madonna experimenting as always, rather than repeating herself.  This album is no Madonna classic--it's no &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; or &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; for example.  It's an &quot;Impressive Instant,&quot; and I'll look forward to something a little more &quot;Amazing.&quot;
B0000033TE|5.0|It's not as much about being the best ELP album than being the most perfect realization they did still with the fire of their golden age. Later albums have lots of matured ideas, maybe more than here, but the lacerating sound was being changed into a truly epic nobility, another moment of ELP's history. I can't think another album in rock history more related to the idea of art rock and conceptual album than this. H. R. Giger's artwork is ELP's music in image - one of those happy coincidences when artists interact. There's metal, bones, flesh and eternity in vision as in the refining agressive music.<br />&quot;Jerusalem&quot; was rejected as single, probably because of conservative reasons. One may think it's contradictory such a sharp-pointed rendition of a Hymn. What you hear sounds more ELP than Parry/Blake, but there's no disrespect, only succeeded appropriating. Ginastera's &quot;Toccata&quot; is an example of the greatest honor a musical arrangement can get: the admiration of the composer. The immortally respected argentinean composer Alberto Ginastera (1916-1983) once said &quot;Keith Emerson has beautifully caught the mood of my piece&quot;. It's possible to understand better the original version of Ginastera's fourth movement of the first piano concerto after hearing BSS. &quot;Still.... You Turn Me On&quot; is from &quot;Lucky man&quot; lineage, as &quot;Benny the Bouncer&quot; from &quot;The Sheriff&quot;. &quot;Still....&quot; is one of Lake's most beautiful compositions, perhaps the only really serene moment of the entire album, few seconds after the &quot;Toccata&quot; nightmare. &quot;Benny&quot;, on the other hand, is the humored scene of BSS, the rest of it has an eventually subtle sarcasm, in a most of time heavy atmosphere. After this song, you have less than four seconds to tight your belt, the next song is \\"Karn Evil 9\\"(the name comes for carnival). No matter how good are the first four pieces of the album, still, you got the feeling that the real message of BSS is inside &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;. This is the best ELP contribuition, not better than Emerson's Concerto or \\"Pirates\\", but more \\"Elpian\\".<br />The first impression of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" is a long tense increasing in its first part, violent hammond sounds, syncopated rhythms and a very wise impressing appearance of new motifs almost without notice - a skilful dealing with larger forms, culminating in a plain and somehow lighter guitar solo, but the tensions increase again and the plain turns into climax. The following second part is what usually ELP played onstage after the 1973-4 tour, it's a pitty they hadn't played \\"Karn Evil 9\\" entirely more times. It's a kind of stabilized version of the of first part' second half, within a more rock format. On the vinyl, one had to turn to B side to hear the first impression' second part, with a fade out on the end of A side and a fade in at the beginning of B side. The first release on CD (Atlantic) kept this effect, though it may have some point for collectors, its terrible keeping this limitation musically speaking. Nowaday's CD versions present first and second parts of first impression perfectly continuous, a dream for ELP fans.<br />The second impression has probably the most daring musical textures in ELP, a jazz fusion feature, and a sensuous caribbean accent sometimes, the lips of the cover. Basically, you find this rock band changing into a powerful jazz piano trio.<br />The third impression is the most melodic part of the piece, with a folk-song like theme, but paradoxically with very provocating lyrics (with Pete's Sinfield contribution) and technology decry. But again the edged rhythms, sounds and harmonies come and you realize that it was just a typical break of ELP's world, inside their own world. So those breaks are their very style.<br />It is almost comical to know that critics once criticized ELP because of technology abuse and at same time an elephantine dealing with classical tradition. Although this is the first band to play alive with synthesizers in history, mostly they never substituted acoustical instruments with synth replicas - they used synths for original sounds, not for imitating. They never used sequencers for playing faster, only for special effects (like the end of Karn Evil 9). On the other hand, their classical and jazz influence never had arguments with their rock side, and that's probably the great accomplishment of Progressive Rock.<br />It's very interesting to know through the bonus track \\"The making of BBS\\" that Emerson knew \\"Tocatta\\" because of brazilian pianist João Carlos Martins, still in The Nice era. Palmer's thoughts about Giger tell a lot about their artistic relation: \\"it's a pitty he doesn't play instrument, he could be in the band\\" Also, Lake's vision about studio albums defines ELP: studio albums should be a promise of what the band can do alive. Good point, as ELP is even better onstage....
B00004U9MS|5.0|That's what I keep thinking over and over whenever I listen to this album, which has been pretty much constantly since I got it 4 weeks ago.  I listen to it so much, in fact, I'm worried that I'm going to actually wear out the disc.  It's crazy.  And I'm not the only one with this problem.  Everyone I've spoken with has been doing the same thing.  As my friend, Stacey, put it, &quot;They put an addictive chemical in this cd that makes me crave it nightly!&quot;<br />The vocalist sings with such sincerity, you think he wrote a song for you.  Well, in fact he did - 10 of them complete with a nice and smooth echo laden guitar base, not too unlike Joshua Tree era U2, and solid rhythm undertones to keep you firmly planted.  This is my new Bus CD and I had to start taking the bus again just to listen to it more.  I'll be interested to hear what else they can put out.
0385486804|4.0|I recommend this book for anyone who has ever had even a touch of wanderlust. The author traces the journey of a misunderstood youth and takes the reader along each exhilirating, tragic step of the way. The story is sad and profound and hopeful all at once. A rare feat of writing! Also recommended by Jane Goodall which is how I came upon it.
B00004X01U|5.0|As a total Madonna Music fan, I must say that this CD is great.  Although I prefer the music on her Ray of Light CD (which by far is her greatest achievement to date), the Music CD has much to offer.  The song MUSIC is a throwback to her underground danceteria era, which is so refreshing to hear after more than 10 years.  I love the song Impressive Instant.  Very new sound that can easily break new ground in the music realm.  Runaway Lover and I Deserve It (penned for her lover Guy Ritche) are good songs as well.  Amazing sounds very similar to her previous hit Beautiful Stranger...very techno and 70s beat.  Don't Tell Me is planned as her second single release from the album and was co-written by her brother-in-law.  What It Feels Like For A girl is easily another chart-topping single just waiting to happen.  Very good sound and beat, and catchy tune.  Paradise Not For Me and Gone leave a little bit more to be said.  In comparison to her Ray Of Light Cd, Music is not as personally based and their is definitley more 'Music' than 'Personal Experience' on this one.  Still, Madonna delivers...PERIOD!
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A is a fine Kid A is a fine release by Radiohead, albeit one that you would not have expected if you hadn't already heard the buzz about the album before it was released.  If you are expecting an extension of OK Computer, you might be disappointed.  And there really isn't any tracks on Kid A that capture the loud, power riffs that can be found on Pablo Honey and The Bends.  If you're buying this because you like Radiohead's previous sounds, you might want to try to listen to the album first or at least download a few MP3's.  But if you open your mind and give the album a chance, I think it is likely that you'll walk away pleasantly surprised.  I honestly can't say I was too impressed the first time I heard it; I was expecting a few songs that could dominate radio waves.  And I'm not sure if this album has those songs (even if it does, Radiohead isn't going to release any singles).  Instead of being dominated by singles, Kid A continues in the tradition of OK Computer of being much, much greater as a whole than its individual parts are.  I can't imagine putting in Kid A to listen to track 2, skip to 6, and then listen to 9 before taking out the disc.  Kid A is meant to be listened to in its entirety.  That isn't to say that Kid A doesn't have its highlights.  \\"The National Anthem\\" stands out, as does \\"Morning Bell\\", and \\"How to Disappear Completely\\".  \\"Optimistic\\", \\"In Limbo\\", and \\"Ideoteque\\" flow into what is almost one greater song - and it works very, very well.<br /> I've given the album four starts, because I'm perhaps biased by being a fan of Radiohead.  And I'm also trying to discount the fact that the expectations of OK Computer may have led to hopes of a bit better album.  If this is produced by anybody else but Radiohead, Kid A likely gets five starts.  As it is, it is an essential part of any Radiohead fan's collection.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|Whatever price you will be paying for this CD, every cent will be worth it! It's been 7 looooong years since their last album &quot;Memorial Beach&quot;, which didn't have such memorable sales figures and hits. When I found out that A-ha had released a new album, I was flabbergasted! When I heard the title track, I was in awe! Listening to the rest of the 12 tracks simply left me speechless! My heroes are back...and I certainly do hope they are here to stay! A-ha's sound is simply unique! They are equally capable of writing slow, dark, moody, haunting songs like &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;, &quot;Little Black Heart&quot; and &quot;To Let You Win&quot;, melodic acoustic tracks like &quot;The Sun Never Shone That Day&quot;, &quot;You'll Never Get Over Me&quot; (my personal favourite!) and &quot;Mary Ellen Makes the Moment Count&quot; or sweet soft ballads like &quot;Velvet&quot;! You simple cannot box A-ha up in one particular sound! The songs here are so diverse, you get a little bit of everything you could ever ask or hope for in a pop-rock CD! 41-year-old Morten Harket's vocals are still top-notch and they range from low and bassy (&quot;To Let You Win&quot;) to an all-time high (&quot;Summer Moved On&quot;)! Wow! This is a musical masterpiece! Much better than all the stuff the boy bands out there like A-1 (have you heard their cover of A-ha's &quot;Take on Me&quot;? A disgrace!) are putting out! Get this CD! After listening to it, I guarantee you will be persuaded to (as Morten howls in &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;), &quot;Stay, don't just walk away&quot;! :)
B000002UB3|5.0|This final Beatles album is the most moving of all, since you can clearly feel that the Fab Four have already confronted and accepted their inevitable split. They're already halfway into their solo careers: John's songs are raw and basic, Paul's are exquisitely produced little noodlings, and George's are prime examples of the brief period when he looked like the band's emerging hero. Grief, division, and bitterness lie just below the high polish of George Martin's lush production; even Ringo's childlike \\"Octopus' Garden\\" is really about wanting to hide from all the bad feeling (he admitted later). What's moving about it is that despite all this, they managed to Come Together one last time to make the magic happen... their playing together at the end of the album says more about their love for each other than 30 subsequent years of interviews.
B00003CWOL|1.0|Looks like someone's let their ambiton get the best of him.  This film is so F-ing boring and so F-ing unintersting that it just makes me wanna F-ing puke.  Usually I like witty comentary on biblical subjects but for the love of god, I like HUMOROUS witty comentary, not comentary so long a drawn out that you forget what the hell they were talking about in the first place.  <br />Let's get one thing straight, movies are a forum for communicating ideas.  Not giving an actor/actress three pages of dialog and saying &quot;read this to the camera, cause this is what I think&quot;.  That's what writers are for.  I don't go to a movie to be told flat out what some jackass thinks about christianity.  I go to be pursuaded and think, &quot;oh, maybe he's got a point there.&quot;<br />Kevin Smith is a direct product of the Hollywood mindframe.  Apparently he believes that making previous movies of moderate  fame gives him the right to make an opus of unintelligent hawgwash.  Man, the ego on this guy.   <br />Kevin, if you're listening, go back to the low brow comedy of the past, and leave thought producing movies to real directors such as PT Anderson, or Joel/Ethan Coen. <br />Definantly the worst thing to come out of 1999. <br />Ciao<br />Dave<br />P.S.  All those people that found this movie &quot;entertaining&quot;, and &quot;utterly delightfull&quot; need to cut the BS, don't pretend like you get it just so you look somewhat witty and intelligent. I'm on to you.
0767834976|1.0|I'm not in favor of book or movie burning but if I could destroy every copy of this movie I would. If there is a more stupid movie than this one I hope I never see it. This one is without doubt the worst movie of all times, so my advise to you is: Don't waste your money buying a copy of this movie, buy Spaceballs or even Pewee's Big Adventure instead. Coud you imagine it was said that this &quot;movie&quot; would beat Jurassic Park at the box office when they where both released in 1993 ?
B00003CWTH|5.0|What a movie! What a magnificant masterpiece!  No I'm not refering to 'Half Baked', I'm refering to none other than MAGNOLIA.  This film became a sort of obsession of mine.  I'll admit that upon first viewing I did not grasp the entire meaning. So I was a wee bit disapointed (either in the movie or in my apparent lack of intelect).  So I saw it again.  My heart sank,  it was as if I'd seen it for the first time.  So much emotion ran through me I couldn't contain myself, yet dispite all this emotion building up in me I still came out of the movie speechless.  After that, insanity took it's toll.  I proceeded to see the film another 6 times in theaters.  Each time as fresh as the last.  <br />It is so refreshing to see a film willing to tackle human emotion especially in this era of mind numbing entertainment.  P.T. knew that the length would scare a lot of people away, I belive that he did this on purpose.  Anybody that considers viewing length before seeing a film is probably not the kind of person you want to see your film.  If you've got other things to do, do them.  <br />So, in closing, I urge everyone to partake in 3 hours of astounding cinematics, excellent acting performances, and a refreshing screenplay.  Magnolia is definantly the best thing to come out of hollywood in a long time. <br />Ciao<br />Dave
B00004XONN|4.0|Being a Brit myself I can't not like this band. I have been a strong follower of this group for many years, and find thom Yorke's voice spine chilling and full of emotion. &quot;Kid A&quot; certainly stand up to the reputation the last three albums have set. The first four tracks of the new album start off where 'OK Computer' finished, with depressing sounds that make you feel cold all over, as though you where at the bottom of the ocean. Things start to go slightly down hill from there 'Treefingers' disappointed me as I was expecting a bolder version of fake plastic trees, but the song is lost without the words falling from Thom Yorke. 'Optomistic' is in the class of its own. Just buy it and listen to it for youself I think you will be happy of the purchase, as I know you won't be able to see them live because I tried my hardest standing in line late Sept '00 for tickets which sold out in less than two minutes. So go home and play this full volume and imagine you are at their concert. The art work finishes it off for me which I didn't think could get any better than the cover of OK Computer, but it certainly fits the style of haunting music.
B000002KHF|5.0|I have to say, I was a bit disappointed in 'Astral Weeks', perhaps I expected too much from it.  But, all the things it lacked were picked up nicely on 'Moondance'.  A much more mature outing than the pretentious Astral Weeks. <br />He'd soon hit his artistic pinocle with the album 'HIS BAND AND THE STREET CHOIR', my personal fav, which I also recommend. <br />Definantly a must have.<br />Ciao<br />Dave
B0000041LL|5.0|I just finished listening to Opus 59 No. 1 and had to write. This is one of the greatest recordings of the one of the greatest quartets played by one of the greatest quartets I have ever heard. Perhaps the greatest. The Quartetto Italiano had the perfect intonation, phrasing, tone, and dynamics that one expects from a modern quartet (they performed from 1945 to 1981), but their musical intelligence, their sense of line, and their intense and continuous concentration was extraordinary. I listened to the great third movement with tears running down my cheeks., I don't remember that happening since a performance by the Tokyo at Caramoor many years ago.  The recording is technically perfect, clean and clear with appropriate channel separation. It sounds like four mikes with the mix done by a musical and technical expert. The original recordings were made in Switzerland between 1967 and 1975 and may have been remixed for these CDs. Whoever worked on this Phillips release deserves the thanks of all chamber music fans.
B000002KAT|4.0|This is definantly an album worth having, don't get me wrong, I just don't think it's THE album to have. Personally, I think it's a tad overrated. I've seen it on many top 100 album lists, usually in the top five, ahead of even Beatles albums.  Van's got better stuff out there, but this is a good place to start. Just don't expect to be blown off your seat right away like I was with The White album.  <br />All in all, a very good album.  A refreshing departure from other blues-jazz albums of the time, but it does lack a sense of strength.<br />Ciao <br />Dave
B00000634J|3.0|While the songs on this album are obviously great, hence, a greatest hits album, i think that one would be better off buying an album which was actually artistically aranged by John Lennon. A good album to start out on would be &quot;Imagine,&quot; or &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;. These albums actually allow you to experience the music the way that it was originally intended to be heard, not just a somewhat random compilation of hits. In my case, I bought this album first, became obsessed w/ John Lennon, and than I bought other Lennon albums, making this purchase  totally worthless. My only warning is, for Lennon beginners, dont purchase something like &quot;Two Virgins,&quot; The wedding album,&quot; or &quot;Life with the Lions.&quot; If you purchase a &quot;sound collage&quot; album first, your odds of liking John Lennon are about as good as the chances of Marilyn Manson opening a day care.
B000002I27|4.0|I love the atmosphere of this album.  The use of keyboards (sometimes harpsischord, sometimes organ, sometimes what sounds like an electronically altered piano) to flesh out the guitar and bass harmonies, combined with not-overdone reverb effects, give the Doors a beautiful, full sound that epitomizes (for me, at least) the word &quot;psychedelic.&quot;  Besides that, the songs are quite good.  Except for the boring 11-minute finale (yes, heresy, I know), there really isn't a bad track here.  &quot;People Are Strange&quot; and &quot;You're Lost Little Girl&quot; are especially powerful.
6305327041|3.0|Hrmm.  Many people will find this movie to be boring and pointless.  However, I watch it time and time again and laugh every time.  Unlike most comedies this movie has actors that can act without being stupid.  A good change in pace from any other movie you have ever seen. It's just whacked, I love it.
6305499365|3.0|I think that anyone who works, or has ever worked in a boring, meaningless job or just any kind of 9 to 5 job (i.e., just about every one) can relate to this movie in one way or another.  You can't help but compare the characters to people you work with.<br />There's the smarmy, fake boss who expects you to bleed for him, the people who constantly tell you stuff you don't need to know  and the bastards who would rather ruin your life than lose one company dollar.<br />Poor little Milton, one of the employees, just sits in the corner, trying to stand up for himself, but everyone knows he's a pushover.  I try my best NOT to be like him!<br />I watched this movie on a Sunday night, which gave me an even bigger dose of Monday-itis than I usually get.  Best to watch this after you've won Tatts, so you can say, &quot;Hey, I don't have to live THAT life any more!&quot;  Amusing comedy with a difference.
6302054982|5.0|Wow!  First off, this movie has a great cast.  Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta work excellent together.  With their combined acting skills and the intense storyline, this movie is bound to reel you in.  I don't remember how many nights my friends and I watched it, but I know that it will never be enough.  Funny, intense, and sad; it draws you in, then spits you out.  You'll have mixed feelings about this movie, and won't want to return it.
0446677450|5.0|Mr.Kiyosaki has done a wonderful job in trying to distibute the wealth evenly to us all. This book was more than I expected. There were detailed explanations of how to make money work for you rather than working for it. Although I am 23 I wish I had read this book six years ago, it has opened my eyes to the reality of financial freedom, a reality which so many people learn when it is too late.  I also appreciate the fact that someone who is &quot;rich&quot; took the time to explain processes which would help others to achieve financial independence. It demonstrates generousity and concern for the well being of others. A must read for anyone who wants to be wealthy.
079213690X|5.0|First of all, watching this movie on a television does not do it justice.  The wide screen vistas and fight scenes are intense in the theater.  Although they are also spectacular in a smaller format, it just isn't the same.  With that aside, this movie has the most intense and realistic battle scenes ever before shown.  Braveheart has many dimensions, the plot is exciting and suspenseful, the characters are well defined and portrayed, and there is an unparalleled scenery and musical accompaniment.  A movie complete with everything it needs to make it memorable and special.
0451167716|4.0|Certainly a good book, The Godfather is one of those commercial bestsellers that stay popular, thanks to the quality of its main features: the plot is intriguing and gripping; the characters are well developed, and the world of the mafia is always fascinating. But the most important characteristic of this book is that it inaugurated a sub-genre that romanticizes the world of the mob. The bosses are no longer vulgar thugs in the streets. They are refined people, with wonderful houses, good manners, who listen opera and conduct business in a sophisticated fashion. And yet, they remain extremely violent people, capable of cruel atrocities and treasons.  The Godfather is a book that slips easily through your hands, because there is not much to reflect upon: it is a truly good action book. Things happen one right after the other, establishing a chain of violent events that lead to the transformation of the New York mob amid violent fighting.  It makes you want to be a mafiosi (though not one of the dead ones). Of course, the films derived from this book are excellent, true classics of cinema.
B000006TZ8|5.0|There's a place in your collection for this CD if you like the Beatles.    Paul Weller was able to capture the magic of shimmering guitars and vocals that beckens you to a mod place and time in England.  The songs on this album capture the vibe and mood of: There's a Place by the Beatles.    This is the Jam's finest work, and if Paul Weller could have continued with this kind of output, without a doubt they would have been the next Beatles!

B00004XONN|5.0|I only bought this cd yesterday, and can say it is stunning. I am impressed, not many bands can follow an all time classic with another great album. <br />Well done Radiohead, it will take more time before I can say if it is as good as OK computer but after hearing the cd only twice I can only say it is amazing.
6305910324|5.0|One of the most enjoyable movies ever. As a parent of two young children, it touched my heart deeply. Everything about this movie is superior. The acting, music, themes, lighting, script, etc., is first rate.The subject is  chess, but the theme is about parental love and wanting and giving to your children what you never had or could have.
B0000399WI|5.0|If you've seen the Green Mile, this movie has that kind of feel to it, except without the supernatural stuff. A very good movie, Morgan freeman was great.not quite as long as Green Mile so you don't have to have 3 1/2 hours to watch it. Good emotionally driven movie.
B000007OY0|5.0|Growing up, did you ever get accused of something you didn't do?  What if you went to prison for it?  How would you feel?<br />How would you feel, stuck inside a prison with many other folks, most of which could be classified as psychopaths?  How would you feel if death and rape and truly evil people were the penalty for a crime you didn't commit?<br />Kind of like the star of this movie...<br />This movie covers a mans journey into hell, the cruel treatment at the hands of his jailers and his fellow prisoners, the friendship between him and his one true friend, and final redemption from the worst that true institutionalization and cruelty can bring.<br />There's so much wonderful feelings in this movie.  Lots of reasons to own this one.<br />Get it.
6304415346|5.0|The curse of star trek movies that even numbered movies are good while odd numbered are bad (exception star trek III) continues in this great movie. The first movie to concentrate 100% on the next gen crew, it features a borg invasion of the alpha quadrant and an attempt to travel to earth's past to assimlate the human race. The battle sequence at the beginning of the movie was quite well done and the borg queen was a brilliant addition to the whole star trek universe. All in all a great movie.
0684853523|5.0|I pre-ordered &quot;On Writing&quot; by about three days and received it in my mailbox at one in the afternoon, yesterday.  At one in the morning - after an entire day of no television or computers - I had soaked up every one of the nearly 300 pages.  I was so inspired by what I read that, instead of going to bed when I completed the book at one a.m., I sat up for another two hours and wrote in my own.<br />Mr. King offers insight and direct instruction in this book and I couldn't recommend it more to an aspiring writer.  My first thought when I heard the book was coming out was: Far out! Stephen King wrote a book JUST FOR ME!  And that's what he did.  He managed to make me laugh out loud, smile, think, mist up and most importantly ... sit down and write.  If you write - or want to write - you will feel like Stephen King's &quot;telepathic&quot; tome was penned just for you.<br />Of course, you'll be wrong.  I'm just sure he did it for me.   ;)

B00004XQP4|4.0|After, i think, the greatest album ever, dookie, and two absolutely fantastic ones, insomniac and nimrod, this was always going to be a success.Disappointingly its not as good as those three, but it is still a good buy. It is more of a pop album, as there is only one real punk song on it (minority). There are no bad songs however, and this is a great asset. There are a few standouts - misery, which is funky with an egyptian feel, - fashion victim, blood sex and booze, and jackass. I did notice a similarity between some of the melodies on here and those on nimrod and insomniac but Billie joe armstrong is still writing great lyrics, and these songs are still pure green day. They will definitely appeal to a wider audience (although some pure fans may be disgusted). If you dont own any of the three i mentioned at the start, buy them before you buy this.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is the movie that first brought the Great acting of Kevin Spacey to my Attention. This movie is a good &quot;Thinker&quot; movie that keeps you guessing. Kevin is great in this movie, and I have to say this is a must see.
B000002IQW|5.0|This album has some of the most powerful vocals and guitar riffs of any commercial metal album.  This is commercial metal at it's best.  If you like any late 80's early 90's commercial metal, then this is the album to get because it beats any other commercial metal albums.  ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0790749556|4.0|Fred Astaire is known, of course, as a dancer, but he was sadly underestimated for his skills as a singer and a musician.  In Roberta, one of the highlights of the film is that we get to see Fred Astaire playing the &quot;feelthy piano&quot; -- Ginger's words, not mine.  Actually, it's a jazzy rendition of &quot;I Won't Dance&quot;.  I love watching Fred Astaire dance, and I really love watching him play the piano!  If I remember correctly, Roberta was the first picture we saw that really showcased the piano-playing of Fred Astaire, others that followed are Follow the Fleet, Broadway Melody of 1940, and Let's Dance.  So go and buy this movie.  Treat yourself to one of the finer things in life!
B00000J6AG|5.0|The simple title, PLAY, reveals the humble man and group MOBY. Playful in conception, this CD can't be classified in just one category of techno, or rock, or blues; it's a unique collection of all. The varied instruments, synthesizer and strings... produce beautiful, neat musical sounds that pulse through my body. Vocals with minimalist lyrics (in most songs) throb in my mind. The women's supernatural voices are perfectly matched with the songs. I love this CD and Moby Songs and Moby Moby. These are the songs I'll associate the new millenium. Play is all I do...everything is play...so naturally I love this one.
B00004XONN|5.0|...in and already it's great.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This stuff is pure garbage.  A chimp could write better music then this.  Are these guys the offspring of the Tele-Tubbies?Absolutely mindless!  Whatever happened to melody in music?
B00004LN16|4.0|AC/DC has finally released a album worth buying;after Razors Edge AC/DC seemed to fade away from the spotlight.Isnt kinda weird they release a incredible album and after that they come out with sorry ones but 10 years later they release yet another great album?Every song on here is pure gold and nice to jam to all the way from Stiff Upper Lip to Give It Up.But I do agree with some people when they say Brian Johnson has lost his screaming voice.But as always,my favorite guitarist Angus,never lets you down.From the beginning to the end his solos and riffs are unbelievable but if you are looking for his best work check out Highway to Hell.
B00004XONN|5.0|So here it finally was.  I put it on, and made everybody go away.  I needed this.<br />And everything really was okay.  It was more than okay.  If The Bends was Thom's &quot;lover's quarrel with the world&quot;, and OKC had all the force and fury of a rocket-blast through the atmosphere, then &quot;Kid A&quot; is the orbit afterward.  You can almost see the thin blue skin of air.  It's exquisite.  Delicate.  Laced through with the genius of their musicianship and the tentative, almost whispered throb of Thom's voice.  <br />You'll need good earphones.  Kid A doesn't give itself away easily...either through the lyrics, or the &quot;tunes&quot;.  And you'll need time.  Afterward, you won't want to join a cause or beat the air with your fists, or weep.  But you'll want to think.  And listen again.  And I promise you everything will be alright.  Buy this.
0811826848|5.0|Worth the wait, worth the price.  A HUGE, picture packed history of the greatest band of all time.  I especially loved the way they sprinkled Johns wit and wisdom throughout the book in such a way that it felt as if he was being interviewed today for the project.  Not an easy task for the editors, I'm sure.  It sometimes brings a tear to ones eye when he talks about the future.  This is a book that takes days to get through and absord, and then you want to read it again.  The coffee table book for all time.  The Beatles themselves are honest and fair in their accounts of the trials and triumphs, and it is clear that through it all, their was a great deal of love between these four guys.  Now every would-be Beatle historian can put down his pen.  It has been written, and it was written by the four who lived it.  The best for last!
B00004XONN|5.0|I got couple of songs from the album early on via the usual Internet channels, and at first I couldn't believe I was listening to Radiohead - guitars were (mostly) gone, Thom's voice was unrecognizable, etc....I almost dismissed them as one of the MP3 spoofs running rampant on the net lately. Then the album came out and I got it the first day - and I haven't stopped listening to it ever since.  As I said in the title - you need to listen to the whole CD in order to truly appreciate it, because the songs play as one continuous 50-minute movement. If you are able, go visit Radiohead's official web site and explore it - it is well worth it. I guess what amazes me the most about Thom and Radiohead as a whole is how they can communicate their ideas without much fuss - everyhting they wanted to say is in the music itself.  I haven't experienced this flawless transfer of raw emotion through music since NIN's 'Downward Spiral'. Kid A favorites - I have none. This is not a singles collection - we'll leave that to N'Sync and such. All in all, truly amazing piece of work which will surely be remembered as one of the finest albums of its era.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This cd is great. I like all the songs on it, i started listening to enigma when they came out with the second album, and then the third with the songs from the movie &quot;Sliver&quot;. Allthough i liked most of the songs on each album there were some that i did not really care for. This fourth album however is great, i love all of the songs on it. The music is very calming and the words speak of truth. The beats keep you in beat with the whole scheme of each song. I listen to this in the car when i am driving home from work to unwind.  i recommend it highly.

B00004XONN|5.0|Well I think it's safe to say that this is the &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;(Miles Davis) of rock albums.  You hear so much praise of their &quot;OK Computer&quot; album but I think this one blows &quot;OK Computer&quot; out of the water.  This cd is fresh from cut one to the very last track with it's best piece being song #3, &quot;The National Anthem&quot;. If I could give more than 5 stars I would, this is easily 10 stars.
B000002H97|4.0|This CD sounds great in my car with the volume pumped up. But on my high-end and expensive stereo at home it shows how poor the recording is.  Still, this is a must-have CD.
0783113943|5.0|From the movies I have seen, Angelina steals the screen in every single scene she's in. Gia is no different and really gives her a chance to shine. She has a quality to her acting that you just have to watch. The physical resemblace to Gia is startling and the whole movie captures something of the model that might otherwise be forgotton. Instead of just a rich, supermodel junkie, Angelina plays Gia as a lost soul. The rest of the cast are all awesome too.
B00004X01U|3.0|My first listening of &quot;Music&quot; left me asking myself why I expected it to be another &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; especially when Madonna has always prided herself on being the grand chameleon of pop. Look back at her past few albums and you see her trying to delve into new genres and experiment a bit, usually successfully, as &quot;Ray of Light&quot; beautifully illustrated. But given that I am a die-hard fan of &quot;classic&quot; Madonna, and of her dance/house club leanings, I was definitely disappointed by &quot;Music.&quot; It lacks the vibrancy of &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; the sensuality and rawness of &quot;Erotica,&quot; and though it takes some chances with its French-techno leanings, I found it lacking *Madonna* herself. Not a bad album by any means, just amazingly unremarkable.
B00000K0E5|5.0|After much time, and a few rough movies, Goldeneye brings James Bond back to his roots, as the Cold War-rior that he has so oft portrayed.  Pierce Brosnan as Bond is magnificent.  I won't waste your time relaying the plot and storyline here, you've all seen Bond films before.  By the end of the film, Bond has foiled the master plan of some devious miscreant, and gets the girl.  This DVD release features some very cool bonuses as well.  There's a running audio commentary, and two rather entertaining documentaries.  So sit back and allow your escapist fantasies to run wild as you enjoy this film.
078322608X|4.0|12 monkeys is one of my favourite movies the theme music is the best. The story is filled with surprises and although its darker than the type of movies I usually watch, it's mood is very important to the story. *spolier alert* - I'm surprised that some people who have seen the movie never realize that the lady at the end of the movie in the plane who says \\"I'm in insurance\\" is the same one we see interrogating Bruce Willis earlier in the movie.
B000002NFM|5.0|I Alwayz Thought That TEKNo Sucked and everything listening To mainly industrial and Punk,Then Somebody let Me Borrow A Copy of This Cd,and I must say its AweSome,The Beats And Everything Fit Right Together.Though i know This Isnt Straight up TeKNO,Its Still Got me iNto Tekno,And IM into Aphex TWin,Portishead And Alot of that Ambient Drum n BAss Trip hop Stuff.But This Band Mixes It With Other Styles Wich is very original and Interesting.the Best TraX Are Breathe,ClimbiTIZe,Fuel my Fire And FireStarter.Another Interesting BAnd To Check out Is MINDleSS SELF INDULGENCE.
B00000IIXH|5.0|Bruce's backside is on fire in this one!  PUT IT OUT!  PUT IT OUT!  A lovely stumble through the authentic Springsteen experience... I found it especially enlightening to finally hear the BOSS admit that he is half ape,  I had long suspected some of his relatives lived in trees (e.g. cover of Human Touch)...  Thanks Bruce, for the low-down in &quot;Half-Man Half-Monkey.  Put this hot little number in your shopping cart and you won't regret it, unless your Credit Card is maxed out.<br />I hope this helped you. I love you.
B000001FFR|4.0|Sprading the Disease,is the best Anthrax Thrash Metal album i've heard.This is pure adrenaline pumping thrash metal.Ripping lead guitars,fast rythymic chops and Charlie Benante, one of the most technical and skilled drummers i've ever heard.Great inspirational lyrics can be found in many of the powerful and thrashing trakcs.Yet,many lyrics create weird situations of paranoia and fear,and how to overcome them.Any,self-respecting Metal fan should get this.It rocks!
0316286443|5.0|This is the second time I have purchased a book by Kevyn Aucoin.  I also purchased (and reviewed &quot;Making Faces&quot; which I loved) and I absolutely LOVE him.  He is without a doubt the most talented make-up artist in the world.  He is amazingly talented and takes make-up to a higher level.  It is true art that this man creates.  I am astonished and awed every time I see his work.  There is so many wonderful and creative ideas that are certainly within the reach of the average woman.  BUT, there is also that wonderful element of Fantasy that &quot;Face Forward&quot; brings to the table.  He is brilliant and I just love his work.  It's a wonderful resource and a fabulous coffee-table book.  I really think you'll love it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Big time movie makers take note: If ever you are interested in doing a High Fantasy movie like a Tolkien, Hobb, Feist, or a Jordan for example, you can do no wrong with the style in which Gladiator was made. Awe inspiring grandeur, Saving Private Ryan style cruelty, and a main character with the magnetism of a Clooney or a Newman.
B00000DCHI|1.0|Boy oh boy.  Am I drunk or are they?  The 'enhanced' addition?  What in God's greeen earth is that supposed to mean?  It's got no new songs, and if they were doctored up in some new extra clear way, I cannot discern the difference...  Maybe Billy and his entourage who beleived that I would pay extra for a copy of this CD, when I can buy the identical original copy for $7 at my freindly neighborhood pawn shop, where hitting the highballs early that day...  But it's obvious they are taking us snobbish Billy Joel enthusiasts for a ride. Save your money and take your kids to McDonalds or buy yourself a new pair of jeans at Sears...  Billy will again find his way to the bargain bin...
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is a Powerful and violent album.A dark and twisted trip through rusted shards of aggresion and hate.A unrelenting Battle cry of uncontained Rage and Frustration.9 individuals that take hold of the jugular and savagely rip the brittle arteries apart. An album that penetrates the mind,with lethal doses of venom.That rips and grinds the limbs with furious percussion(1 drummer and 2 percussionists),crushing guitars(2 guitarist and 1 bassist),caustic noise(a sampler),dark techno(a dj)and passionate,tormented vocals(vocalist).A violent symphony of blistering speed and precision.
B0000027I6|5.0|Amused to death is a wonderful album. Arguably rogers best work ever. If one was to compare it to a floyd album it is most like the final cut. An amusing point is that Jeff Beck plays guitar on many tracks and well he was the prefered replacement for Syd Barrett but the band was too in awe of him to ask him. Jeff Beck has a unique style and has done amazing work on the album. The album number one strengh is in thr lyrics. I would recomend this album to anyone that enjoyed the wall and the final cut. Post Waters pink floyd fans may find it too different but still a great album....
B0000214F0|4.0|I got to warn you...  this is nothing like the BBC's I, Claudius.  Oh my no!  Tons of nakedness and sexy sexiness.<br />Not for children, kid's got no business watching this sort of hanky-panky!  I think it should be against the damn law!<br />Oh goodness.  Also, the sea of freaks-sex show part in Tiberous magic cave almost put me over the edge.  Wowzers!  Is this stuff true?  I never heard of some of the stuff going on in the background of that bad news bear.<br />Also, Ben Hur was not in this movie at all, not even played by another actor.  And if I remember what our adult Sunday school teacher (the pastor's wife) told us correctly, I think that he and Caligula were friends.<br />I don't know what to beleive anymore.<br />I hoped this helped you... I love you.
B00004XONN|5.0|Its just that, art. If you have read reviews that said there was a lack of gutiars, well thats not entirly true. I would say its more of a lack of drums. &quot;Kid A&quot; needs to be listened to when you have free time and are in tune with the music, or I should say art. This is alot different from &quot;Ok computer&quot;, which you acourse probly already know. There both 5 star albums, but they could have done something better with &quot;Kid A&quot;. They could have made it a 2 cd album. Using these 10 tracks in between rock and roll songs, and there usaly uplifiting and energetic songs like &quot;Uptight&quot; and &quot;Let down&quot;. But I guess they just wanted to shock every one. Possibly the band was very stoned on this album. Obviously they dont care about selling albums. Because they dident make 1 radio song on the album. There are no videos or singles like on &quot;ok computer&quot;. There is 15 second promitnal videos shown on M2 and mtv. On the skits there hipnotic bears walking around. Also if you open the black part on the album, theres an extra booklet. I was all excited when I found it cause I thought it was the lryics; it wasent. It was a bunch of sayings and sentences that have meanings that the normal person can never firgue out. The art work on the album, is almost as important as the music. The 1st booklet has some great artwork, though could have had more bears, and so does the second. I havent listened to &quot;Everything in its right place&quot; or &quot;Kid A&quot; all the way through yet. But I listened to the rest of the songs twice. &quot;The national anthem&quot; was farmiliar to me cause I saw the comercial for this track. Its a dark, but good song with plenty of trumpets. That is the last thing you would expect on this song. I mean traditional radiohead would blast away with bazaar gutair solo's. &quot;How to disappear completely&quot; is the closest to normal Radiohead on the album. Acoustic gutairs over Thom's voice. Which makes merember another strange thing. Radiohead isent practically present in this album. I mean Thom is more of a intrument with his voice because its not always present. Well anyway &quot;How to dissipear completly&quot; has some very good vocals at the end. &quot;Treefingers&quot; is preety pointless. Radiohead leave the trace music to moby. &quot;Optomistic&quot; is the next track, and its a very good song. &quot;In limbo&quot; I dont remeber to much. Now the strangest song on the album &quot;Idioteque&quot;. This song is great. Very intesense voice over a techno beat. Its kinda of hard to explain it, just go buy the album. &quot;Morning bell&quot; and &quot;Motion picture soundtrack&quot; are both great songs&quot;. &quot;Mps&quot; is the only light on the entire album. Well anyways, it will keep me very busy for a long time. If you like Radiohead, then give this one a chance, once this album klicks you will be amazed.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Lets do the math here folks: 2 crappy guitarists + a mediocre drummer + 2 crappy percussionists + a crappy bassist + plus 2 queers on sampling and turntables + an annoying singer = one of the worst albums ever.   ITs not bad enough that they have no talent, but at the same time they have to have no originality, they borrow from past bands but dont add anything to the mix themselves, to add that they bad mouth their forefathers, korn, and act like they're a bunch o tuff guys and how everyone else is posers, but they dont realize they're the biggest posers themselves.
0780622650|1.0|I can't get over how bad Lost in Space is.  It's so pitifully dumb one has to wonder if the script was written as the movie was being filmed.  This is MTS3K material and everybody involved should be ashamed.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is a great cd. Yes, I believe that it is better than 'Dookie'. The song writing on this album is incredible. There is also a variety on this album, where on 'Dookie' all the songs were electric rockers. &quot;Macy Day Parade&quot;, a slow, acoustic song is one of the best on 'Warning'. Billy Joe's vocals are excellent, and he is a great lyricist. If Green Day puts out another album this good, they'll be one of the greats. Keep it up, Green Day!
B00004XQP4|4.0|Hey there Green Day Fans. If you are expecting a punk record like in the past on such albums as Dookie or Kerplunk think again. These pop-punkers have traded in their Distortion sound for a mellow blend of pop. The results...A Killer album!!! But any Green Day fan knows that Billie Joe is a fine song writer and can pull off just about anything when it comes to music. One standout tune is Macy Day Parade...a fine ballad of the paths Billie has traveled along the way to being where he is today. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS CLASSIC ALBUM FROM GREEN DAY.
0811826848|5.0|There is some material in the text, and photos, that we've seen elsewhere. But there are a lot of new interview quotes and photos and documents that are only to be found in this book. It's really a delicious Beatles feast to go through this book. I love it. And there are some new facts I never knew before (did you know George Harrison lost his virginity with John, Paul and Pete Best IN THE ROOM WITH HIM? See p. 54). <br />This is a must-have for any Beatles fan. Buy it. Or ask Santa Claus to give it to you. I hear he's a Beatles fan, too!
0385495323|5.0|Singh's book is great. It is easy to read (I finished it in just two sittings). Singh has a wonderful writing style which makes the book hard to put down. He has a good coverage of material, but leaves out some of the more interesting applications of cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs, digital cash, certification authorities, etc (for a more complete coverage of these topics read Bruce Schneier's book &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot;). He also has no mention of AES and puts too much faith in PGP (after stating that no encryption scheme is entirely safe). I'm being a bit picky, the book is excellent and well worth the read.
0811826848|5.0|First of all, I would like to thank Amazon.com for shipping this book in the most timliest of manners, it was greatly appreciated.<br />Now, although I have been waiting for The Beatles Anthology book to be released for quite some time now, I must admit that it has far exceeded my expectations.  Well-written, insightful and bold at times, we now have at last the answers we have been waiting for; whether we like them or not.  An obvious must-read for Beatles' fans of all ages, and an veritable textbook for us all, this book is well worth the price.  Be ready for some heavy lifting though, and remember to use your legs not your back when you pick it up, lol :-)  I hope that anyone who reads this book will enjoy it as much as I am enjoying it...happy reading!
630512762X|4.0|short but sweet review- This movie had great acting, an interesting and somewhat original plot and great action scenes.  Definately Woo's best American work.
B000002UJQ|5.0|three years it has been since i bought this cd and for those 3 years it hasn't left my stereo.i'm 32, and i've heard all kinds of music from many eras, but this......this i can't describe, it's so good , it's beyond my comprehension. sometimes, it just makes me cry from happiness, it's unexplainable. can't wait until the 17th, i'm going to see them in concert...one of the lucky few.
B000006NXP|5.0|This is my favourite reading of Brahms' fourth symphonie.  Kleiber is extremely focused all the way through.  The strings are bright and present an energetic and disciplined performance.  The notes by Bernard Jacobson are very instructive.  Regarding the first movement, I learned that &quot;Brahms here breaks with the custom, followed in his three earlier symphonic first movements, of repeating the exposition...Brahms keeps the development section proceeding on lines that exactly match those of the exposition.&quot;  Only at the sounding of the third horn, supported by the clarinets, roughly 1'30&quot;, is the first exposition complete.  The Allegro giocoso sounds epic, and I feel it should accompany an action-adventure-sci-fi movie.  The fourth movement is very impressive to me.  It moves forward with a great deal of force, and it is one of the places where I feel that Kleiber shines.  Jacobson notes, &quot;the finale is cast in the form of a passacaglia, or set of variations on a regularly repeated ground bass; and through the thirty variations that lead to its inexorably tragic coda, the shape of the bass is preserved with remarkable fidelity.&quot;  If you are interested in music from one of the most important composers of the late 19th century, or if you are interested in a uniquely superb reading of this popular symphonie, this CD will interest you.
0060987464|5.0|I am not that much of a reader, but being as how i am a big marilyn manson fan, i picked up this book. i was instantly hooked when i started reading it, it is graphic, thought-provoking, and an intense look into the struggles and tribulations of one of the worlds most notorious shock-rock stars.  Very reccomended, even if you absolutely hate manson, or have never heard of him.  The parts that stuck with me were his 3 lists (How to tell if you are gay, How to tell if you are a drug-addict, and how to tell if you are cheating on your girlfreind, all very strange).  10 out of 10!
1574531298|5.0|I am a clinical therapist and started exploring this subject after reading Brian Weiss's &quot;Many Lives, Many Masters.&quot; I have since had my own past life regressions, and now I am trained by Dr. Weiss to do regressions myself.  The information in this book is not made up by Newton. I can tell you that his clients provided him with the information because I know personally the experience of regression and of regressing others. Each individual has a fascinating story to tell about past lives. I couldn't possibly come up with the tales I hear, nor could the clients. They are not inventing these experiences. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore what happens after death.
6305903182|4.0|Usually, by the time you get to part 3 in a series, it is not very good, but not in this case.  This movie is very well-thought out and well-written.  It has some unexpected twists that will almost guarentee that you will be guessing who the killer is throughout the whole movie.  The acting is good, but not great, and it is still kinda scary!  A worthy way to end a trilogy. Good job Wes! 8 out of 10. Reccomended!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops I Did It Again is a great CD. I have it playing all the time. All of the songs are great, not 1, not some, but ALL.
0783211856|5.0|I saw this movie first in 7th grade for social studies class years ago, and ever since, i have loved this movie!  It was the first to have a real dramatic impact on me.  The acting is unreal, the script is amazing, the camera, direction, and effect on your heart and soul are all phenomenal!  This film is no joke, it is graphic and surreal and should be viewed by everyone to see the effects hatred can have on the world.  One requirement for this movie is that you must be able to take alot of violence and carnage(especially in the part when they liquidate the jewish ghetto).  This film is not ment to exploit, but to teach. Watch it, but be prepared, especially for thr overwhelming tear-jerking conclusion. A milestone for movies! 20 out of 10!
0792846443|5.0|It's been too long since I've seen a thriller like this one.  By this, I mean this is truly a gem that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to the very end.  Rent this one, you won't regret it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is my favorite marilyn manson cd.  It is jam-packed with hard-hitting, intense metal/shock rock.  The fest songs are: &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, &quot;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&quot;, &quot;Mr. Superstar&quot;, &quot;Angel with the scabbed wings&quot;, &quot;1996&quot;, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, and &quot;The Reflecting God&quot;.  The Best out of them all is by far &quot;The Reflecting God&quot;.  It the most powerful song ever created.  UNBELIEVEABLE CD BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!
B00004TLMC|2.0|The film struck me as though I were watching it after having had as much champagne as Nicole Kidman had at the party at the outset. A slow, miserably trying movie which wants to be something more than it actually is. It did not intrigue me at all, and I felt it that it was something Stanley Kubrick had shot if he were smoking hashish in astonishing quantities. The New York locations were artificially unconvincing, Tom Cruise's performance was adequately lukewarm-like most of his prioir performances, in this viewer's opinion. The story was at best, uninteresting, and, as you can surmise, I felt that this was an instantly forgettable film unworthy of even a second viewing because I found it to be inordinately boring. The only highlight for me was seeing Nicole Kidman's tantalizingly luscious nipples.
6304711875|5.0|This is by far the best in the series!  It is like Wes Craven put more into it, because everything in it is better, the only thing that is not as good about this one than the other 2 is that in this one, it was easier to guess the killers, but still not too easy.  This one also has more of a comedic touch to it, which i liked.  The big first kill is much better than that of parts 2 and 3.  And the violence factor in this one is much higher than the sequels.  I highly reccomend to watch the whole series to get the full effect, but watch them in order, it will make it SOO much less confusing for you in soo many ways. reccomended. 9.5 out of 10!
B00004XONN|2.0|Most of the qualities that made The Bends and OK Computer great, such as great songwriting and musicianship are absent on this CD. Its almost like they tried so hard to be different from every other band that they forgot to write good songs along the way. Don't get me wrong. Its still better than most of the other CDs that are coming out lately. However, its really frustrating to listen to this boring, lifeless music, when you know they are capable of so much more. I hope they saved the best songs for their new one coming out in the spring.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This has got to be one of the best groups out there today!  The music is hard, without being mindless and repetative, the lyrics are so deep and thought-provoking that they can make you think for hours, and Corey's speediness in letting loose his aggression that it is unreal!  If you can, find the original with &quot;frail limb nursery&quot; and &quot;purity&quot;(not made anymore) but you can find it used in some places.  This particular one without those 2 tracks, however is still amazing!  The best track is &quot;No Life&quot;, It is so brutal and fast that it will make your head spin! Buy it now even if you don't like this kind of music, it is completely original and fresh and, i promise you won't be dissappointed!
B000005ITX|5.0|For over 20 years this has been my link to a time that affected me greatly but which I did not participate.  One often wonders how the Woodstock Generation really felt.  Was it really 'Groovie', mellow and just a stoned out trip.  This album lets you know the experience was a lot more complex then a simple Dylan lyric or a Hendrix guitar hook. The music is as complex as an ex-teeny bopper singles writer Brian Wilson put to wax on Pet Sounds, even entering the area of the Lovin' Spoonfull's 'Hums of the Lovin' Spoonfull and the Byrd's Sweetheart of the Rodeo' on 'Bummer in the Summer'.  Much of the album has the subtlety of Rennaissance era Kinks.  Forever Changes doesn't seem to have a direct link to any other album of the period lyrically.  The occassional comparison could be made to Dylan, but socially I'd compare it more to 'Beggar's Banquet'.  Oh yeah, the horns are really cool too.<br />I don't claim to know a bloody thing about other Love Albums.  Yes, I've heard them, and forgot them almost as quickly.  This is truly lightning in a bottle, much like Rod Stewart's 'Every Picture Tells A Story' or even better 'Moby Grape'.  Occasionally the gods of music just show up in a studio and possess the bodies therein.<br />I feel there might be 100 albums made that are must owns.  If I had that list in my hand this cd would be in my shopping cart on the first trip to the store.
B00000GJ2B|5.0|After i viewed this movie, i sat still for about 30 minutes recalling the utter masterpiece that i had just witnessed.  I have NEVER in my life seen acting like what was in this fine movie.  Don't be fooled by what you see on the cover, this is not just some normal boxing movie.  This movie is intense, hard to watch, painful, very graphic, very obscene(especially in lunguage), very surreal, and very violent. It has the most violent and gory boxing scenes ever captured in cinema, and is absolutely stunning for a boxing movie. Ranks up with Rocky.  One of my favorites! Highly Reccomended!!!
0783226063|5.0|This movie was panned by audiences and critics alike when its highly-anticipated release occurred in 1984, and since then it has become one of the legendary &quot;bad films&quot; of Hollywood (think &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; or &quot;Ishtar&quot;).  But the fact remains, DUNE simply doesn't deserve this treatment, as evidenced by its steadily growing popularity over the years.  Misunderstood in 1984, DUNE is more and more being appreciated for the magnificent film that it is.  It was ahead of its time, but its time has come.<br />Why was this movie so despised?  I believe that it's because it tried to be all things to all people.  This movie disappointed the &quot;typical&quot; moviegoer who expected to see &quot;Star Wars&quot; but instead got a gothic, Shakespearian epic tale of political intrigue and messianic destiny.  Hard-core fans of Herbert's fabulous novels were disappointed by the relatively underdeveloped characters and key omitted sequences, not to mention the un-Herbertian presence of David Lynch's stylistic elements (for example, the &quot;heart plugs&quot;).  Hence, no one was pleased...and the movie bombed.<br />But DUNE bombed undeservedly.  Any objective eye in either of the camps mentioned above will realize that DUNE does a yeoman's job of compressing a far-reaching epic into two and a half hours (try filming War and Peace in under three hours), providing a taste for the epic tale.  The medium of film simply does not provide good translations of great books in most cases (with a few exception), so DUNE the movie needs to be appreciated for its own sake.  As to those who found this movie too complex, well, don't be offended, but maybe this kind of thing is above your head intellectually.<br />This is the version to see (in my opinion the &quot;Smithee&quot; version(s) are so poorly edited that they aren't worth watching (although the added scenes are fascinating, especially as they relate to Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Halleck and the Fremen sequences).  Hopefully, Mr. Lynch will realize what a great work he created with DUNE and return to produce a real expanded Director's Cut.  Until then, though, this is your best bet...and by the way, consider investigating the books, both Frank Herbert's original six volumes and the new Brian Herbert-Anderson &quot;prequel&quot; series.  All excellent.
0060926317|5.0|I read this book a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it.  I recomended it to many friends, most of who enjoyed it also.  Don't touch this book though a) if you are you are a skeptic (stick to something more scientific and tangible and languish there where you feel comfortable), b) are offended by simple truths, c) are more deeply concerned whether the book is fiction or non-fiction than the message within d)if you can't get your head round the fact that despite outward appearances all humans belong to one race.  For readers with an open mind, you may or may not enjoy the book, but there is a message within for everyone if you care to look.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Sure, Oliver Stone is a typical Hollywood left-wing liberal and he wants you to think that anyone who would take part in the wonderful REAL world of true capitalism is evil. But, maybe he should realize that he is grossly rich. Why is that ok? And not making a career out of being a Wall Street entrepreneur? I enjoyed the movie for what I thought of it, not for what Stone was trying to say. Yes, there are those of us out here who enjoy getting rich investing other people's money! So stop pointing the finger and realize that it's what makes our country great! RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM and the true spirit of capitalism. AND FOR ONCE STOP TAKING SHOTS AT ONE OF THE GREATEST PRESIDENTS THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN!RONALD REAGAN
B00004U8P9|5.0|Finally, 20th Century Fox has done a great job of putting The Rocky Horror Picture Show onto video with this amazing DVD.  I don't want to repeat all of the things that everyone else has said in the other reviews, so here is what I liked about this DVD.  This is the first time that the original film audio track has ever been on a video of this movie in the U.S.  It is selectable by choosing 'ENGLISH MONO'.  The 'ENGLISH DOLBY 5.1' audio selection is a brand new stereo digital audio mix, with none of the lazy mistakes that you can hear on the earlier VHS releases.  Of course, because most of the songs on the stereo track have been re-recorded from the soundtrack album (which is a little different in some places), the 'Transylvanians' (during the TIME WARP) sound more like a choir(on the stereo track) than 'munchkins' (on the mono track) like they are supposed to.  But it sounds great.  The only bad thing that I noticed was when you select the U.S. version to watch; Instead of actually using a U.S. print of the film, they just took the U.K. version of the video and cut out the song 'Superheroes'.  In the U.S. Theater release, the music was remixed so that you couldn't tell that anything was missing, but on this video, you can actually hear the start of the 'Superheroes' music and then a drastic change in the audio where it has been removed.  It is okay though, because the actual U.S. Ending with the properly mixed music is on the Second DVD in the menu under 'Alternate Endings'.     The second DVD in the set contains most (if not all) of the bonus material that (I Believe) has only previously been available at the end of the U.K. Widescreen video of the movie.<br />This DVD is the only video version of the movie that truly captures the film the way it was originally made and should be part of every Rocky Horror fan's video collection.
630575067X|1.0|I first saw this movie on my tv. My first reaction was : what ?, why so much fuss about nothing ? The special-effects are very weak, you can see tranparencies on the screen ! The best actor in the movie is Jar-Jar, he could earn an oscar. There is no plot, the movie is dull and i fall asleep 30 minutes after the beginning. The movie looks like very old.
B00000JMOJ|4.0|(minus one star for the sound)I have seen this movie several times, mostly on television, and I have always found it to be a very exciting and watchable movie. Like other reviewers, my biggest problem with the movie is that it is the same scene over and over. But even so, when you throw in Arnold (i still cant spell his last name), you are guaranteed to taken for the ride of your life. while not an actor with much dramatic range, he still seems to be the only actor who can appear in a movie like this and make it seem like it was the role he was born to play. Dawson is terrific as the almost-likable villian Killian, and the girl in this goes perfectly with arnolds character. If you like action, blood, excitment, and more blood, then check this one out. It may not be the most intellegent movies to come out of the 80's, but it is one the most fun and exciting. Now, whay isn't there a dolby digital track on this disc? I thought the main point of owning dvds is the picture AND the sound. pro logic may cut on vhs, but not on dvd. I'm waiting to see if they'll rerelease it with dts or dd. good movie, cheap disc.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I also agree this is by far the most beautifully arranged collection of Christmas songs, and it's timeless.  It saddens and upsets me so much that this incredible lady, with a voice from heaven, died so young.  You see, I grew up listening to the The Carpenters, and not just at Christmas time like most stations tend to only do.  I know all of their songs and arrangements by heart, and feel fortunate to have been around when they were consistently rotated on every radio station.  I can't think of any other contemporary singer that has the depth, and a vocal presence that practically &quot;jumps out of, and projects from my stereo speakers as Karen's&quot;.  She didn't use any of those vocal &quot;scat&quot; gimmicks that a lot of singers are copying from each other lately.  Karen just sang the song, and allowed her soul to come through, naturally.  Listen to &quot;I need to be in love&quot;, and I think you'll agree.  By the way, I heard an excellent cover version of this song combined with Irving Berlins &quot;They Say That Falling In Love Is Wonderful&quot; by a singer/songwiter named Michael Poss.  I got it from this guys official site, and it's on his new CD called &quot;Silver Screen Serenades&quot;.  It definitely comes very close interpreting the same melancholy feel that naturally came across with Karen's voice.  I also bought the Holiday CD single, called &quot;Christmas in Chicago&quot; from Michael Poss' site, and it's the perfect lover's response to Karen's 'Darling' mentioned in the song &quot;Merry Christmas, Darling&quot;.  I wish Richard Carpenter had tons and tons of demos to release, so that all of us could listen, too.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I give it 5 stars because I do like the film. And Russel Crowe is a good actor, but is he really the star everyone is gushing over.  Really look at it objectively, Crowe dosen't really have that much dialogue. Just a bunch of well acted fighting, and in the end it's over for him as well as Commodus.  Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand has tons of drama.  Some powerfull scenes with his &quot;father&quot;, good long scenes with his &quot;sister&quot;, really show what a coward Commodus was.  I thought this was great acting, even though Crowe is the listed star, In my opinion, it's Phoenix's character that really draws out some fine drama, and powerfull acting.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album means so much to me. When i first heard it i couldn't believe that this was the clash. Who's ever heard such a variety of music? I know i never have. It wasn't only variety its quality was amazing, just every aspect to it. They absolutely blew the sex pistols away with every album they made, this one just decimated the pistols.If johnny rotten ever says the clash weren't talented then we all know he was just jealous. Bollocks to you Mr.Rotten.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is very strong and deserves the attention it is getting.  I can't imagine why someone would seriously run down this disc.  There is a feeling of there old style here and of course their old style was great.  The highlights are The Wicker Man, A Brave New World, Fallen Angel and Thin Line Between love and Hate.  Bruce is back and all is right in the world of heavy metal again.  I actually loved the disc upon my first listening but now I am addicted to it and take it everywhere I go.  I would also recommend Bruce's solo cds he did during his absence from Maiden.   &lt;&gt;&lt;
1572522232|5.0|This is real hardcore horror. The film has a presence and atmosphere so unique and terrifying it will astound and shock you in equal measure. Right from the start, with the Goblins creepy if a little nauseating soundtrack, you know youre in for one hell of a ride. The first murder seqeunce is one of the most imaginitive, terrifying and intense scenes ever created this side of Wes Craven. The execution of the setpieces are very sophisticated technically (strange for a 70's horror flick) and the sound and cinematography could teach even the most skilled horror directors a thing or two. The plot is a little thin but Argento really makes it come alive. The way this man visualises pure terror is disturbing in itself. The acting is a little poor but then most horror films from the 70's (despite the inferior The Excorsist) are'nt exactly oscar worthy on those levels. It's the type of horror film that makes you feel like a young child; vunerable, unaware of the hysteria thats about to take place and unable to cope with the horror your'e confronted with, as well as making you feel like you've never seen anything like it before (which you have'nt) or will ever see again.
6303407188|5.0|Its a shame, really, that tim burton's gratest film did so poorly in theaters (its one of disney's top bottom money makers). the video is out of stock (luckly i have my copy) and sadly there are no plans whatsoever on releasing this film on dvd.<br />this is a great film. its also johnny depp's best performance ever (in the title role). martin landau won an oscar for his performance as bela logousi, he even bet samuel l. jackson in pulp fiction.<br />i'm only writing this review hoping someone will hear me out and release this film on dvd, a criterion collection edition would be great!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I was reading a review of this video saying it had bad sound clarity.  1. Buy a dvd player  2. It sounds great  3. Only thing they could do to make it sound better is use dts. I work at a A/V store and have a nifty system in my home. The bass sounds great and you wouldn't believe what the sub channel has. When the band is not playing you can hear the string bass and all kinds of great stuff. All i want is people to review when they have the right equipment to even have an idea of whats really going on.
6304398395|4.0|This is a very good movie about the life and work of the greatest genius in film history. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Charlie! He captures Charlie's mannerisms, his wit and his sadness.  Watch as Geraldine Chaplin plays the role of her real grandmother.
0312962118|5.0|This book is simply excellent. It is gripping, full of action, intriguing, surprising and shocking. The description of the events, the characters and the expressions are very well detailed. I think is Meade's best book so far, followed by Sands of the Sakkara (which was very enjoyable also). Anyway, it made my commuting more enjoyable.
B00000JLXG|1.0|I don't understand the appeal of this movie, I honestly don't.  The plot of the movie (if there is one, I have yet to ascertain if one actually exists) is weak, the acting is OK at best, and it was so boring that I actually fell asleep watching it!  The F/X are good, but not on the level of Independence Day or Twister.  Some things that happened to the Titanic herself before she sank (including a severe coal fire and nearly colliding with a ship before she even left Belfast harbor) were left out entirely, and would have made for some nifty special effects sequences.  The dark, forboding &quot;feeling&quot; of Aliens and the Terminator movies were absent from Titanic, yet it still managed to be depressing.  One of the few highlights of the movie was Jack teaching Rose how to spit, and Kate Winslet's overall performance impressed me.  But Leo himself...well, we won't go there.  I much preferred James Cameron's previous epics, and I don't know what possessed him to make such a drastic change in his movie-making style.
0812550706|5.0|One day, my friend recommeded me this book. I followed his advice, and it was worth it. Ender's Game shows how the underdogs can win and how tough military school is. All he characters did very good jobs of being themselves, espeicially Ender and Valentine. I am looking forward to reading Speaker of the Dead, the sequal. You have no reason not to read this book....
6305263248|4.0|That is Robert DeNiro starring in an action movie, though to kids not farmilar with his performances in Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, it's not suprising to see him compromising his art.  That's not to say Ronin's a bad film, in fact it's pretty good, but in retrospect it marked the beginning of a long slide for DeNiro that has yet to end.  While churning out money-makers at a record pace he has yet to return to form and hasn't given a truly phenomenal performance since Cape Fear.  This time he stars as an ex-CIA operative whose left out in the cold after the Cold War has ended.  This leads to more than a few car chases and coming from the director of The French Connection, they don't disappoint.  Natasha McElphone turns in another steller performance coming off of two of my favorite movies - The Truman Show and The Devil's Own.  The locations are some of the best in film for a long time, reminsant of the days when that actually meant something.  Buckle in because this is one wild ride and while not much else you're sure to be satisfied with the results.
B000006OS2|1.0|The movie is a classic John and Maureen.  The problem is that the transfer appears to have been done in a theatre, with a video camera using a very old print that has been run hundreds of times.  This gives you images with what appear to be tears, burns and other image reducing faults.  I went back to my old VHS copy to see what the real image was supposed to look like. All in all, one of the worst transfers I have ever seen.
B00004U8H4|5.0|American Psycho is more than the best serial killer in recent memory (oops, did I forget Silence of the Lambs? No!), it's also a savagely funny satire on consumer culture and the general gluttony that is our country.  Christian Bale gives a knockout, powerhouse, I only wish there were enough glowing agitives to describe, performance as Patick Bateman, a yuppie VP whose 'nightly bloodlust starts to slip into his days.'  That's not to say it's a particularly deep or profound performance, in fact it's that lack of depth that makes him such a marvel to watch.  You see Bateman's both an everyman and a nobody - a nameless, faceless drone steering his way through an ocean of disinterest.  Probably the most frightening aspect is the fact that he fits in so well.  The reason being that nobody really listens to what one another has to say, they're all just waiting for their turn to talk.  Fans of the novel, and I must confess I am one, in seek of graphic violence might want to look elsewhere becuase it's not the bloodshed that makes this movie so good.  It's the way it holds a mirror to us and forces some self-examination - something alot of us are very resistant to.  In the end it's a totally refreshing expierence, a movie that's actually not afraid to be original.  And it's nice to see, especially given the poor Seven-ripoffs we've seen over the past five years.  Fans of the film should check out the director's cut DVD which offers a minute or so of additional footage, the best of which comes during that infamously hysterical three-way.
0671027344|5.0|This was a truly touching book. It is written in diary form, which made it even beter. It is a comin-of-age novel about a boy named Charlie. It tells of his trials and tribulations in and out of his freshman year of high school. His friend Michael just recently committed suicide. He makes new friends who are seniors that he would never forget. This makes a truly interesting story that's a real page-turner.
6305922756|5.0|While maybe not the funniest film ever made, though you can make a case for it, Spinal Tap is surely the most inventive.  Spawning a slew of ripoffs and inspiring some pretty well stylized movies, Bob Roberts and Boogie Nights to name a few, the mockumentary format in the hands of directors less capable than Rob Reiner has been ridden into the ground.  From start to finish the fab four manage to make constant (ugh...) jerks! of themselves.  Co-written by the cast I image it was as much fun for them to make as it is for us to watch.  Christopher Guest (Jamie Lee Curtis' husband if you're interested) and Michael McKean have the most prominant roles as a pair of guitarists (that's right, two lead guitarists) playing in a down-on-their-luck band called, you guested it - Spinal Tap.  They wale out some of the most side-splittingly funny songs ever captured on tape and during one performance find themselves playing amdist midgets and an eighteen inch model of Stone Hinge, you've gotta see it to realize how funny it actually is.  Maybe the best part of this DVD is the commentary track by the band, playing it in character and equally funny now as they were sixteen years ago.  You won't see me give many comedies a five star review but I can't help but when a movie can keep me laughing like this one did.
B00004XQP4|5.0|5 stars in punk style. FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY GREEN DAY ISN'T MY FAV BAND..BUT I REALLY LIKE SOME OF THEIR SONGS SUCH AS &quot;WHEN I COME AROUND&quot;,&quot;BASKET CASE&quot; AND CHRISTIE ROAD..... so...after insomniac,i think it is thei worst cd..,it was the time of nimrod...not bad but they could do much more.. well...how is warning? it sounds like dookie and there are two or three tracks that could be taken from nimrod..such as misery or warning. it's a very good work both for lirycs and sounds.. there are some eccellent songs like macy's day parade,deadbeat ,minority and also hold on.. it's punk and listening to it i was felling the same i was feeling when they were at the top... i say it's their best cd cause ,after two &quot;medium quality&quot;cds, they've come back with more power and more attitude,if it's possible.so...it's green day at their old style..and it works..believe me. buy it! the only track i can consider worse is warning..but i don't care.

B00004XONN|5.0|If i were to be stuck on a desert island and had the chose of 5 albums it would be (in no particular order) Radiohead: Kid A, Pink Floyd: Dark Side of the Moon, Beatles: Magical Mystery Tour, Genesis: The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, and Mr. Bungle: California.  Kid A is definetely the best album out this year.... in fact i'd have to say its the best album out in a LONG time .... as in the past few decades (with the exception of a few)..... its also the most original thing i've heard in a long time... plus it grows on you the more you listen to it.
B000002HPV|5.0|If I could only bring two things to a desert island, I'd definately bring this album and a cd player (I know about batteries and crap, don't be so technical).  Honestly, this album has saved my life more than once.  This album is more of a self help course than a music cd.  This album, being self written and produced, shows that she has come a long way from The Sugarcubes.  Songs such as &quot;Joga&quot; and &quot;Bachelorette&quot; really tug at those heart strings.  Taking a vacation from normalcy, Bjork ventures into more of an acid dance vibe with &quot;Pluto&quot; but keeps her composure.  Tracks like &quot;All Is Full Of Love&quot; should be ample proof of her unique yet superior vocal talents.  &quot;Alarm Call&quot; has also become a personal anthem to me.  Undoubtedly, Bjork is the greatest singer/songwriter since Joni Mitchell.  My only regret is that I didn't discover her talents earlier.<br />&quot;My headphones saved my life...&quot;
B000000OQF|5.0|This record consist of 12 songs and they are all great, every song reflect the groups relationship with Los Angeles and the tough life that they had to live until they got spotted by Geffen records. I still shiver and get goose bumps when I hear the intro to welcome to the jungle My favourite song on this record are the following: Welcome to the jungle, Rocketqueen( a quite odd song about relationship), Mr brownstone( a song about hasch addiction), Anything goes, so easy, night train,<br />think about you, just to mention a few.... I prefer the 3 first records(live like a suicide, Apettite for destruction and GN'R LIES) I would also like to mention that Axl has released a new song for the motion picture &quot;End of days&quot; with the BIG Austrian Guy ARNOLD ALEXANDER FANNI
B00004XONN|5.0|While I have admired Radiohead for a long time, this is the first album of theirs I've bought.  Not like it's a bad thing to backtrack.  It immediately caught my attention with &quot;Idioteque&quot;, being a Funkstorung and Aphex Twin fan.  This album more or less proves that Thom Yorke is the backbone of alternative music.  The dreary and twisted vocals on &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; pulls you down to the murky depths of your soul.  Then you get tossed around your own skull in the flowing ambience of &quot;Kid A&quot;.  Thankful to some, Radiohead still demonstrates some of their old flare and style on tracks like &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, &quot;Optimistic&quot;, and &quot;In Limbo&quot;.  Yet they take themselves to a brand new level with some electronic influences.  &quot;Treefingers&quot; is a completely instrumental track that sets that represents the overall tone of the incredible artwork therein.  Thom's voice pierces through the bass and static of &quot;Idioteque&quot; and demonstrates almost a rave quality.  &quot;Morning Bell&quot; pulls you away from the grit and grim and leaves you floating into the abyss, only to be picked up on last time with &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;.  The greatest feature this album has to offer is not the music itself, but the booklet hidden behind the case.<br />Buy it and see what I mean.
0790729628|2.0|3 things bothered me. 1. Bad sound. This is a movie, like &quot;Star Wars&quot; in which the soundtrack plays a huge role, and my normally booming DVD player suddenly sounded like an AM radio. 2. The whole film seemed very jumpy. You'll notice this in the opening credits, which are fuzzy and occasionally bump up and down. Is this a film that needs to be restored? If so, somebody please do it.  3.  Extra features - where were they? For all its faults, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is a work of art, and deserves DVD extras at least as impressive as those of &quot;Fight Club&quot;, perhaps even the full &quot;Brazil&quot; treatment. Where are the storyboards, the making-of, the director's commentary? My dream is that Criterion or somebody gets their hands on this beautiful film and gives it the DVD it deserves.
0780631684|4.0|This movie was awesome! Awesome. Do I dare say more beside the word awesome!
B00004Z4SD|1.0|Well, I'd heard good things about this film and seen some very interesting advertising ... The potential for this film seemed good.<br />It's already available on DVD here in the UK, so I hired it, and was only too pleased to be able to give it back. How anybody can rave about a film that spends two hours showing a bloke on a lawnmower, with NO comedy sub-plots, very little humour and a REALLY irritating tune that plays through the entire film, well, I guess I can understand why the mental health institutions are still well stocked.<br />I also made the mistake of inviting my family round to watch the film (my father had expressed an interest) ... Needless to say they've declined every offer since ...<br />Save your money, sanity and two hours of your lives and watch paint dry instead ... I only gave this film one star because Amazon don't allow negative values.
B00004XONN|5.0|Listen, it's this simple: If you have an open mind, aren't scared of a band breaking from a bass, guitar, drums formula, and really, really, really LIKE music, then this album is for you.  Some people will not get this album.  Radiohead is going to get such a severe backlash for this, comparable to the Smashing Pumpkins' &quot;Adore&quot;.  They are both albums that took risks and almost completely alienated their fan base.  However, where &quot;Adore&quot; was a pretentious load of digital fluff, &quot;KID A&quot; is one of the most original, thought provoking pieces of art I have ever seen, or heard.  By &quot;seen&quot; I mean all the wonderful art on the inside.  It's one of those rare cases where the art created for the album actually looks like how the album sounds.  I found myself listening to &quot;KID A&quot; and making strange scenarios in my head.  While drifting off to sleep after work one day, I turned on &quot;KID A&quot; and slipped my headphones on.  What fantastic imagery if you are in the right mood!  This is not an album that you'll be in the mood for all the time, but when you feel like listening to it, it's the most wonderful music.
B00004TRD8|1.0|this movie is VERY preditcable just like the first one. you KNOW what's going to happen next BEFORE you see what happens! i have found a site and read the script to this movie and let me tell you one thing AFTER reading the script to this movie and then watching it. the movie itself makes NO SENSE! even when you read the script it still doesn't make ANY sense either one of these movies. they just don't make any sense and the effects get old after awhile. the movie itself is VERY over-rated and how MANY times do you have watch  director's cuts of the SAME movie? this dvd has about 3+ to be exact and it gets rather boring and pointless after the first few mintues. sure he and that patrick guy are robots in the movie,but they act so retared playing it! this movie might be a clut classic and all,but the movie and ALL the differnet verisons of dvds and vhs make it a clut classic. this sci-fi makes no sense i have seen other sci-fi movies about robots(i.e. borgs-star trek)that have made MORE sense! avoid this movie it will just make you sick!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater.  It was great then and even better now that I've seen it again on DVD.  If you don't like to think during your movies, this isn't for you...its one of the most thought provoking I've ever seen.  Lots of interesting self-analysis that goes on during the movie.
B00000I8UE|4.0|As I grow older and demand something more interesting and innovative to listen to ,yet produce a rewarding result,I am constantly prepared to persevere with something conceptual and unusual.This tribute to Miles Dewey Davis, and a showcase to the talent and ambition of Ms Wilson,is just such a recording. From the outset this is an adult work,at times not quite hitting the mark,but bursting with genuine emotion and interpretative understanding that Miles would have surely approved.<br />I would recommend that this CD be listened to at least four or five times before passing any form of judgement..in fact it is playing as I type this review.It is a multi layered and complicated and yet at times jazzy and delicate, being a showcase for Ms Wilson's at times,*whiskey and cigarette* voice and at other times husky and melancholy delivery.At all times her vocals are interesting,and I note a pleasing duet with another great voice,Angelique Kidjo,on the final cut,Voodoo Reprise.Ms Wilson 's range is substantial and hynotic on this CD.I will, with relish, listen to her previous recordings of jazz standards and blues influenced material,for a further fix.<br />The CD opens with one of the stronger tracks,Run The Voodoo Down,and closes with a Reprise.The music of Miles Davis is complimented by the lyrics of Ms Wilson perfectly and  this is an interpretive funky fusion of Afro beats and deep earthy vocals which set a pace that is continued throughout the CD.In fact praise should be given to the musicians on this CD,especially to the percussion and base credits of Lonnie Plaxico on acoustic base on most tracks and Jeffrey Haynes on percussion.It is pleasing to see a jazz artist stretch the boundaries and include mandolin,greek bazouki,harmonica,and an assortment of guitar variations.The result is not always consistent and lends to the listener overcoming a wave of acoustic string and jazz rock fusion sounds played at frantic pace on some tracks and then a slowing of the pace to a more melancholy jazz or blues feel.<br />My overall assessment is that this CD is a worthy addition to your collection.I recommend to you the beautiful interpretation of the Cyndi Lauper written,*Time After Time*with its soft emotional and melancholy delivery.I believe that this version ranks with the excellent interpretation of Eva Cassidy,and makes this song one of the truely great vehicles for interpretive singing in the last 20 years.There are the interpretations of Tutu and Blue in Green,Resurrection Blues and Sky and Sea,which are innovative and ambitious deliveries,worthy of contunal plays. The soft and sensual jazz delivery of the former gives way to a more acoustic interpretation of the later.I would also recommend Piper as a pleasing track. The Afro almost middle east feel that permeates through the later half of the CD,coupled with Ms Wilson's jazz influenced voice makes listening to this a rewarding experience.Whether listened to alone or with another,give yourself time to appreciate this music and you will find it growing on you.If you love percussion based music this is equally a delight.<br />This does require your undivided attention for the initial listenings and is something savoured.It is not easy listening,but it is different, adult and rewarding,and after the final track has played you must remember that it was dedicated to a true innovator of modern music whose music required you to earn the joy it provided. I give this 4 stars which will probably rise to 5 as I appreciate it more.Call it a workout for your senses...get fit!!!!!more melancholy jazz or blues feel.<br />My overall assessment is that this CD is a worthy addition to your collection.I recommend to you the beautiful interpretation of the Cyndi Lauper written,*Time After Time*with its soft emotional and melancholy delivery.I believe that this version ranks with the excellent interpretation of Eva Cassidy,and makes this song one of the truely great vehicles for interpretive singing in the last 20 years.There are the interpretations of Tutu and Blue in Green,Resurrection Blues and Sky and Sea,which are innovative and ambitious deliveries,worthy of contunal plays.

0875847706|4.0|This is an inspiring read for my personal life, and certain examples touched my heart deeply. Downside - I don't have much context for the authors' examples, though it's thought there is application of this to the corporate world. Was looking for a &quot;thumping good read&quot; to boost me on the job, and it more boosts me outside work world. Would a book more geared toward work maybe written by the authors+ a businessperson be a good next move?  Hard to say. Still, as a former Landmark Education Graduate of many, many adult education classes, it was enchanting to see Landmark's concepts of creating possibility and vision embodied in the book. It's also exciting to consider those concepts being read about by many folks everywhere via Amazon.com
0811826848|5.0|This is a piece of history made by the history makers themselves.  It has some childhood pictures that you've never seen before. The book also provides extensive background information about the band's nonstop club dates and the struggles they had to endure before they finally landed a record deal.  Some of the quotes or pictures are from the Anthology but there is much more here which makes this book worth buying. There are photos on just about every single page and some great candid shots taken by the Beatles themselves.  This book should keep any Beatles fan entertained and informed.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This looks like pretty much a good TV episode, basically. A two hour, incredibly expensive, special effects laden, with basically good acting TV show. A movie, I believe, should never expect a sequel, even if it is absolutely certain that a sequel is coming. Starship Troopers did it, and that was incredibly annoying: though that wasn't the only problem with Starship Troopers. The only movie that's ever done it successfully was Empire Strikes Back, which could have been the last movie in the series. The Rebels, for all we knew, could have jumped out into hyperspace and never come back to the galaxy. Phantom Menace did it horribly, though; even the same director can't pull it off more than once. This one BEGS for the next episode. Which would be great if this was a television program, but it ain't. If they could punch one of these out every year, or every six months, I wouldn't mind so much. But there should have been some kind of concrete ending, not &quot;I'm going off, everythings unfinished&quot;. Still, a great, great showing. And INCREDIBLY faithful to the comic. And the Rogue-Wolverine relationship was great. I loved it, and I mean loved it. Though I was dissapointed that she wasn't as much of a babe as in the comics, but then you can't have everything. Well, good DVD, good movie, etc. Hugh Jackman should go on to great things from this, because I saw some great potential beyond pure action.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This DVD comes from elite entertainment, the makers of the best DVD special editions of movies like these.  First off, this movie is hilarious and gory.  The plot is extremely stupid, which I like, and the special effects are way over the top.  The DVD has more extras than you can wave a stick at, so it's well worth your money. I highly reccomend this one.
B000002P5R|1.0|I can't fault the music, but I can the selection. This is yet another bogus, money-wringing con job on the part of the Hendrix family. If you want the definitive final album from Jimi Hendrix, seek out the deleted (by the family, of course) &quot;Voodoo Soup&quot;. That disc was produced and compiled by Alan Douglas, the true caretaker of the Hendrix recorded legacy. &quot;Voodoo Soup&quot; is as close to what Jimi would likely have released as we'll ever get again. Ignore this and all Experience  Hendrix crap and seek out the Alan Douglas releases, ESPECIALLY &quot;Voodoo Soup&quot;.
B00004SST6|4.0|Its been years since I've bought a George Benson album. Having been a fan of his guitar virtuosity from the days of White Rabbit and Good King Bad, I was dismayed by his seemingly permanent move to the world of disco and soft jazz/soul. The teaser for Absolute Benson promised a taste of the old days once again so I was lured into buying the album. Well, it took a few listens to appreciate what George was doing here. It is not like the days of long ago, but neither is Absolute Benson like the disco pop atrocities of the late 70s-80s. That veteran producer Tommy LiPuma is here is a plus, so is the presence of keyboard master Joe Sample. As it turns out, Absolute Benson is an enjoyable mixture of jazz and blues with just enough guitar heroics to evoke the days of old, but also enough understatement to let you know that this is a new day. The album is smooth enough to play at the office, yet generates enough musical energy to make it perfect background for a party. My favorite cuts are the last two, the bluesy Come Back Baby and the George Benson-Joe Sample composition Medicine Man. If you are an old time fan who has been ambivalent about the musical path Benson has taken, its time to shake it off because he proves here that he's still cookin'.
B00004XONN|5.0|I recieved Kid A in the mail yesterday, and listened to it in it's entirety for the first time, and the second, and the third. I'm listening to it at this moment. I can't tear myself away from it. It is the most amazing album I've heard in years. I would put it above its predecessor OK Computer. The only album in the past ten years that I think could be better is Pearl Jam's Ten. I was skeptical about Kid A before I got it. I thought a Radiohead without a strong presence of guitars and without a strong presence of Thom Yorke's amazing voice would be lacking. As soon as I heard &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot;, I knew Radiohead could still amaze with a different style. In the past 30 hours that Kid A has been in my possession, I have come to think that it is possibly the Sgt. Peppers of our time. It is revolutionary. I only hope that it will prove equally influential.
0792151712|2.0|This is a great effort and has good special f/x and design, although the price to make the movie could feed the world for a few centuries.  The plot is, well, let's just say down-right watered-down.  The movie tries to be an emotion filled drama but to me, came out only as a corny attempt to make me cry.  The director is awesome, but the storyline is the only problem.  The storyline is the reason why I deducted three stars.  I saw this movie in theaters.  While 20% of the people were crying, mostly insecure teenage girls that were just dumped.  I on the other hand, feel asleep after two hours and woke up when the ship was sinking and laughed.  A good use of a pool and make-up, poor use of money, a slightly worse than poor plot.
B000005ILF|5.0|most of the customer reviews i've read here seem disenchanted effort but i think its one of the better and most creative albums from any major &quot;pop&quot; star in the last decade.  sting is a master at taking incredibly complicated musical structures an time signatures (you'll see 5/4, 7/8 and even 9/8 in this album) and wrapping sweet melodies around them to make them seem natural.  odd time signatures are extremely unnatural, and its a testimony to his genius that most people listen to the songs without realizing there's something funny going on.  as i've said, i'm not sure what the critics don't like; i've seen comments ranging from &quot;the album doesn't have a distinct story arc&quot; (this matters??) to &quot;its not punk enough&quot;.  this is a smooth and sophisticated effort, unlike some of his earlier post police work which can become difficult to listen to, and you'll continue to notice new things about the music for quite a while (what are the first and last sung words in the album?  mercury falling).
B00003CWTI|5.0|This film is a true classic. It has meanings on many levels which allows it to appeal to many people, but with a bum numbbing running time of over three hours, many people may have chosen to give this film a miss. And miss they certainly did.<br />Unbelievable performances from a huge cast, delivering emotionally potent performances in the most difficult of circumstances, allows Magnolia to win through rewarding the viewer with one of those rare movies which can touch the soul. <br />This DVD also rewards the viewer with a myriad of quality special features. A diary of the making of Magnolia at 1 hour 15 minutes long, theatrical teaser / trailer, TV spots (which aren't great in truth) and TJ Mackey deleted scenes. Another feature which is hidden from the user is outtakes which I found very funny. To see them, click on the TV lines option and sit there for about 20 seconds and the outtakes will begin.<br />Again, I can't emphasise enough how much I enjoyed this DVD and the features contained within. Buy now and you won't be disappointed!
630575070X|1.0|When I first encountered the first, or Im sorry the prequel or whatever it was, some twenty years ago I was enchanted by the somewhat radically unradical notion of the film's premise, simply two men having a conversation over dinner. It was a thoroughly delightful film which stimulated me. But now, I mean I really dont get the spaceships or poorly designed aliens. Louis Malle what were you thinking. I didn't even see Wallace Shawn throughout the entire film.
B00000JCOV|5.0|The 14 track cd opens up with a repeating phrase &quot;the whole thing I think its sick&quot; without rhythm or any other meaning than to tell you the mayhem that will burst open on this disc. The first track (Sic) is a percussion driven song with very good metal riffs and with Corey screaming out the lyrics the song can be no less than perfection. High points on the album are tattered and torn, eyeless, liberate. But song number 7 releases you into the mind of Slipknot. Over eerie sounding guitars, and a scream that sounds helpless but you could be scared of it, Slipknot shows you that they are absolutely crazy. But the hidden track you do not want to even know about. Listen to it, but it is one of the sickest things ive heard. If you like Metal, be sure to pick up this cd. I was not into hardcore, but once I listened to this I couldnt get enough. Be sure to pick this one up, its a great album.
B000003NA4|5.0|Diana Krall has done for modern vocal jazz what no other artist could do. She is the only artist I have heard that can come even close to matching the great sounds of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Bessie Smith. Her CDs are full of vibrant emotion that truly digs at your heart strings. This CD is a particularly great example of her ability to appeal to your sense of love and emotion. I bought this CD because I had previously bought, When I Look In Your Eyes which I think is probably slightly better than this album but just because this album is very one-tracked at times. (I'll get a review up of that album one of these days.)<br />Diana's soft sultry voice starts out with one of my favorite songs of all time, &quot;All Or Nothing At All&quot; and manages to do this great swing song more justice than just about anyone else I have heard. Choosing a favorite track is hard but I would probably have to choose this first track. &quot;Peel Me A Grape&quot; has a great very invigorating sound to it. Some of her best efforts on the album though are actually on some of the slower numbers like &quot;Garden In The Rain&quot; where her vocal control and the lovely sound of her voice truly comes out. She of course does a Berlin classic, &quot;How Deep Is The Ocean (How High Is The Sky)&quot;, where she also shows off her keyboard skills and a Gershwin classic, &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me&quot; which she does with all the independence and strength she can muster. This CD is very slow and quiet especially on number like &quot;I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You&quot; where she almost sounds like a ghost herself, but it is not going to put you to sleep. Every single sound is filled with her raw erotic emotion that makes you feel like every song is sung for you individually.<br />It is also very important to stress that Diana is backed up on this album by the wonderful bassist, Christina McBride, and the guitarist, Russell Malone. Whose sounds add a great backup to Diana's wonderful voice. The instruments are used sparingly but do a great job of accentuating the already wonderful sounds produced by Diana's vocal chords.<br />If you like this CD which if you have a taste for music I am sure you will then I highly recommend you check out Diana's other albums especially When I Look In Your Eyes. To find anything else similar to this sound I think you have to go back in time. The three artists mentioned above, Ella, Bessie, and Billie are other good artists to check out.<br />I highly recommend this album to anyone who really likes soft powerful vocal jazz and blues. This album is especially great to put on when you're sitting down with your loved one for a quiet night alone.kup to Diana's wonderful voice.

B00004T37H|5.0|Princess Mononoke is the final, full-length animation from master  Hayao Miyazaki, and I believe it is his best work.  Drawing you into its fabulous plot, full of excitement and mystery, the strong emotions evoked are balanced out with its outstanding music.  You can watch Princess Mononoke over and over again, and discover new depth each time.... whether it be in the story itself, or the amount of work that has gone into it.  A story that will stay with you forever!

B00004YM0D|5.0|I would recomend this cd to anyone. It still brings tears to my eyes. Rember the titans was such a realistic movie about comming together and putting racial differences aside and beecoming friends and becoming &quot;perfect&quot; in every way as a team.
B00004U8PA|5.0|Whether you like the movie or not, the songs are addictive.  My ultimate best pal HATES the movie with every fiber of his being, but is completely in love with the musical numbers.<br />Writing a review of the film would be a waste.  Just see it, sing along, and shout at your tv.
B000002ITK|3.0|As I right this review (October, 2000) I am nodding my head and stopping my foot. Dee Snider was way ahead of this time. The singing (SCREAMING) may put some folks off but I find some of the lyrics quite motivational. Of course other lyrics are offensive to just about anybody. Sometimes, when you really wanna rock, you have take the good with the bad. Between the soothing vocals of Dee and the thumping, head bobbing rythyms of Tony Petri, Twisted Sister still moves me and makes me jealous of rockstars who can feel good about caking on the make up and keeping their hair in shape with a perm. Rock on Dee and never forget how good the early eighties were to everyone.
6305127638|5.0|The Next Generation cast has had one really good movie so far, and this is it. Captain Picard squares off against his old enemies the Borg as they try to assimilate Earth of the past.<br />The concept is well though out, and there are some great ideas going through the story as well. Misplaced hero worship. The ironic twist of Picard as Captain Queeg (since that was to be his next role following this).<br />But as usual, the movie falls apart when they try to do comic bits. Star Trek excels when the humor comes from the character interaction, not from jokes about &quot;taking a leak.&quot;<br />Patrick Stewart leads the familiar cast, adding Alice Krige to the mix as the heretofore unknown Borg Queen.<br />Great concepts.... adequate execution.
0515125024|5.0|This is a fantastic book!  If you are looking for a fast, action packed thriller this is the one for you. Jack Reacher is the perfect hero and more you read the more you love him. The plot twists and turns leading to a heart stopping climax. Lee Child has constructed a complexe, explosive thriller which will take you off the edge of your seat. A MUST READ!!!
B00004WGC4|5.0|then you may be dead. Or, maybe you've stayed at a bed and breakfast like The Fawlty Towers. John Cleese (Monty Python) plays Basil Fawlty, who along with his wife runs The Fawlty Towers. Basically, the entire series is an excuse to let Cleese do his patented slow-boil, get caught in compromising positions, and be mean to bellhop Manuel.<br />This is mean-spirited British humor at it's best. Cleese has rarely been better. And the supporting cast, lead by Connie Booth, is great. Stop in and see why this is one of the great comedies of all time.
B00003CX95|5.0|What can I say about this movie? I can barely guess how many times I've seen it... once in the theater, 20-something times on regular VHS and now, finally, on dvd. This is one of a handful of movies I feel can ONLY be viewed in widescreen. If you enjoy the battle scenes -you need the extra meat on the sides. That's all that mattered to me. Of course the \\"making of...\\" is sweet, and who will say no to some free trailers? But the commentary by Mel was lackluster at best, and even depressed me when he talked of cutting scenes that sounded cool, like a wicked night battle -I wouldn't have complained if the movie were a half hour longer!<br />Braveheart truly stands peerless in it's genre, having been so lovingly crafted in every aspect... costumes, acting, camera work, music, scenery, humor, villainy, betrayal, love, and unmatched spirit. High on my list of favorites.
B0000025BL|5.0|It's been nearly a quarter century since this album was released, and still I can listen to it for hours without tiring of it. The early criticism was that it didn't fit with the music of the day. I think that's why it stands today as such a great album. The Meatloaf/Jim Steinman collaboration is one borne of the love that each had for theatrics. This album is best when it soars to new heights that few have dared climb. Almost operatic in nature, yet very sexual in context, &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; combined genres with ease. There is not a bad track on this album. Best are the title track and &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light.&quot;
6300181464|5.0|I still wonder if Universal got the idea for Earth 2 from this film? All kidding aside. Silent Running is a classic science fiction adventure that has a strong, if not serious message to it. It depicts what our future might be like in the 8th year of the 21st Century, 2008 AD, and how the human race could easily cause a worldwide outbreak of pollution. It asks the the question of what would you do if you were in astronaut Lowell's (Bruce Dern)position. I like everything about this movie. From the special effects, to costumes, to set designs, to the plot, etc. Bruce Dern plays the character of Lowell extremely well. A conflicted man who sadly goes to extremes to save the last of Earth's forests from being destroyed. And the drones Huey, Dewey, and Louie were really cool. Obviously the model for R2-D2 in The Star Wars saga, the drones had a unique personality of their own. The other characters played by Cliff Potts, Ron Rifkin, and Jesse Vint truly represent the implicit cynicism that is in our world today. People who don't care about anything anymore. Only caring about the Almighty Dollar. Douglas Trumbull did an extraordianry job directing the film. His experience as a special effects technician in both 2001 and The Andromeda Strain really shows and pays off in this wonderful film. A film that has a personality of its own. If you enjoy good science fiction, you'll enjoy this cult-classic.<br />Interesting trivia note-stock footage of this film was used in another science ficion cult-classic. Battlestar Galactica.
B00000IQW0|4.0|... .<br />The last Battlestar, Galactica, leads a ragtag fugitive fleet away from the tyranny of the robotic Cylons in search of a lost tribe that has settled on a mythical planet known as Earth. While it was labeled as a rip-off, the fact is it was an excellent series that is only now getting the respect it deserves.<br />The widescreen treatment is courtesy of the fact that Universal marketed a different edit in theaters overseas. All in all, a great disc for the science fiction fan in your house.
0783110928|5.0|&quot;Gia&quot; was an awesome movie.  Since I bought it, I've watched it soooooo many times!
6305609721|5.0|Everyone else seems to love this movie. For me, it was alright. The classic fish-out-of-water tale gets the Star Trek treatment as the intrepid crew heads to 20th century San Francisco so that they can look silly. Director Leonard Nimoy, who also helped develop the story, spares no one in his none-to-subtle &quot;save the whales&quot; movie.<br />Star Trek has always been great when they take social issues of today and transform them into a science fiction realm. This one translates the science fiction into the social issue of today, with mixed results. Everyone is given something to do, unfortunately, that helps to point up the lack of ability many of the original crew possess acting wise.<br />A good movie, witty but not subtle.
B00004XONN|5.0|At first listen I was very leary...strange music...a lot of filler...but after several listens and a little maryjane I was entranced...please listen to this cd with headphones for the whole effect.
B00003CX7L|5.0|This was an even funnier and clever movie than the first Toy Story.  I was totally amazed at how it kept everyone laughing and each time you watch it there is something else that you notice.  The plot was great and easy to understand for children and yet interesting to adults as well.  I would recommend this to everyone who wants to laugh or smile. ;)
6305232660|3.0|Except for some dramatic scenes featuring Robert Duvall this film gets bogged down in an overlong story about the fate of a TV reporter and pays too little attention to the fate of everyone else. But when they finally get to the real action it is worth the wait. Unlike ARMAGEDDON, which showed truck-sized asteroids hitting the Earth with the force of furniture falling off a skyscraper, DEEP IMPACT manages some very realistic effects. However, the notion that a large comet could be neutralized by an atomic explosion just hours before impact with Earth is without basis in science. Even deflecting a comet would require an explosion several months in advance of impact.
B000001EPB|5.0|This cd is AWESOME!  my best friend Kristin is an Irish step dancer and one night while I was at her house we watched it. We must have played the video 10 times well then she ordered the cd from amazon and now when I'm at her house we dress yp in dance costumes and dance around to the soundtrack!   :)  If you haven't bought it yet, BUY IT!  You know you wanna
B00004XONN|5.0|This highly anticipated release is completely different from all of RH's previous albums. Alot of people expected them to create another 'OK Computer' but they did quite the opposite. 'Kid A' is brilliant, however, those expecting a rock or pop album are in for a rude awakening. The band has taken on new horizons, mostly offering composotions rather than conventional songs. 'The National Anthem' is my favourite track on the album, which concludes with a John Zorn-eque frenzy of saxophone and guitars. All of the tracks on this CD are classics, a fine example of a band that isn't afraid to push limits and create their own boundaries.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|You should see &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; before getting this to get the full context of where these songs are coming from.  Bjork is amazing in this film and proves that her talents reach beyond the incredible music she writes. I am also very thankful for the presence of Thom Yorke on &quot;I've Seen it All&quot; because the actor who does the vocals in the film (I'm sorry I've forgotten your name but you were in Fargo) has a terrible singing voice.
B00004U8JV|2.0|for the public at large and especially the fans of these two films.Fans,who in large part,helped make both films blockbusters.I purchased an all in one dvd/surround sound reciever with DD5.1 and DTS capability.I agree that DTS is the superior sound standard.It's more powerful,clearer,and the sound channels are seperated more effectively(no aspect of the audio dominates at any one time).It's a sound standard that Spielberg helped to invent ,and it was first utilized in the theatrical version of Jurassic Park.He's a huge advocate of this format,and that's why i would like to know why fans of DTS and The JP films,like me, are being treated like an unwanted stepchild.Get DD5.1 and you get extras,purchase the DTS version and you get zilch.Oh wait you get a documentary.A documentary that's been televised numerous times before,around the time each film was released,it's nothing new.Storyboards.Please stop.Storyboards leave me board.Please throw me another bone mr SS.I don't want to hear that because DTS isn't compressed that they couldn't fit the extras.Didn't they ever hear of a Two-Disc Set?I'm officially protesting these Dvd's until they start showing some respect for the consumer and give the fans what they want.Plus,you know there's probably a &quot;definitive version&quot;waiting to be released after the all the first generation dvd's are sold.Just like boogie nights and evil dead and countless others.SS has become way too arrogant and self important that's he's forgotten who made him who he is,the moviegoing public and his fans.I'm not a fan of his but i do like JP and the Lost World.PS:with the purchase of the 83.00 box set i think you get a coupon for a rampaging rhino lollipop,compliments of ILM and Mr berg himself.There such swell guys.
B00000IPAX|5.0|After 3 amazing cds, Blink 182 returns with their first taste of real popularity. Most people I talk to now say that Blink sold out. Well I don't see how that is possible. They're doing just what they did before, only now they're being recognised for it. I dont think that makes them sellouts at all. Plus, this album is really great. Believe it or not, one of my top songs on the album is Wendy Clear, which I havent found anoyone who agrees with me on. But as you know, Adam's Song is amazing, All The Small Things was good, but radio play killed it. Basically every song here is great. So what are you waiting for, click &quot;Add To Cart&quot; now, and while your at it, go reserve their new live album, &quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show&quot;
B00003CWPR|4.0|&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was the last visually rich and complex vision given to us by Stanley Kubrick before his death. I have always much preferred Kubrick's films for the look and composition more than the ideas, from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; to &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; it's more the style than story. But here he was actually saying something. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; explores the dark corners of a relationship, principally of marriage. It exposes the worries lovers have when they deal with trust and faithfulness. Kubrick brilliantly paints an effective and disturbing picture here. The character in the beginning who tries to seduce the Nicole Kidman character at a party reeks with evil poison and Kubrick just shows us the idea, he knows we're smart enough to figure it out. The performances are also superb. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are excellent, which is an achievement because as a married couple, this must have been a difficult movie at times because of the feelings and emotions it raises. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a fitting finale for Kubrick. The orgy sequence is brilliant because it is not meant to turn you on, it's creepy, darkly atmospheric and Dantenean. I only wish a better ending had been filmed. It just resolves too quickly and simply with a little naughty word. Still, this is a good movie, dark, but sharp and intelligent and very complex. I was surprised because Kubrick, as I said, is more about style. He usually doesn't present philosophical genius mingled with brilliant visuales like Oliver Stone. But here there is something that speaks into the hearts of relationships. It shows why Kubrick is one of the lasting giants of filmmaking.
0380804557|5.0|With some warped fairy tale conventions, Stardust is a wonderfully escapist story that effortlessly dances into your heart. The cast of peripheral characters and scheming villains are all funny, colorful, nasty, or unusual, in that trademark Neil Gaiman way. This is a quest story; Tristan Durst undertakes one to win the love of a village maid. Quests are supposed to be difficult, of course, but Tristan's single-minded determination in the complex plot makes for some very funny situations. It's a cheerful story, with just enough darkness around the edges to keep it interesting. Perhaps because Gaiman did such a great job of creating characters and side plots, I felt something was lacking in places where we don't learn more about them. Over-all, it has a familiar enough feel to make for comfy fantasy reading, but with ingenious differences that keep you from getting too sure about what's coming next.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|If you like action movies where reality is suspended then this is one for you. Lots of shooting, big and colourful explosions, bad guys doing the dirty and being shot, and so on. If you get frustrated by movies where the good guys shoot five for every one that the bad guys shoot, then save your money - or buy 'Das Boot'. The 5:1 rule seems to apply whether it's hand guns, naval guns or torpedoes. The unreality extends to the ships taking part, the accuracy of gunfire, the damage that results, and the physical impossibility of some of the disasters that strike, and the heroic actions that recover from them. As if that wasn't enough, the script is apalling, although the actors make a 'heroic' attempt to make it work. I can't believe anyone would think this is reality, and nobody should be getting upset that it doesn't do justice to the sailors who did the real work. It's simply using a couple of tidbits from history to create a typical Hollywood crash-and-bang action movie.
0316286443|5.0|I saw Kevyn on the Oprah show!  How beautiful the women were after Kevyn's talented artistry.  The book is a must have.  It shows the techniques that even we can use.  Explained so even we can actually understand.  This will be a great christmas gift for my girlfriends with the &quot;six essential items&quot; he recommends attached to the gift box! (so martha.....I know).....
B000050AMA|4.0|I've always loved the music on this album but until now have only been able to listen to the live versions on the Great Deceiver box set.  The sound of the standard cd was horrible!  So I decided to take a chance on this new remastering.  Believe me when I say that this is NOT an attempt to re-issue back catalog for the purpose of making more money.  Not only was this version remastered with new 24-bit technology, but, it is also HDCD encoded! If you've never heard HDCD discs, you don't know what you're missing!  The original cd of Lark's Tongues sounded like the music was recorded with pillows over the mics!  This new remastering removes the pillows, and I'm hearing things I've never heard before (vocals in Lark's Tongues Part 1!).  I rated this at 4 stars only because the original recording is not the best, but this is by far the best sounding Lark's Tongues yet!
B00000DGUG|4.0|Anything that Alanis would have released after &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; would have been a disappointment - for fans and herself. So it was no surprise that sales fell short of &quot;Pill&quot; and the critics who were on the edge of their seats, waiting for such an event to happen, were forced to re-evaluate their feelings for Alanis as an artist and as a person. Commercially, this CD is too long. Dumping 6 songs and adding &quot;Uninvited&quot; would have spurred this CD on a more commercial path. Second, Alanis should have used a bit more restraint in her songwriting. There are just too many lyrics to digest in most of the songs. Ultimately, the CD comes off as being too wordy. Lastly, there were some major league bad decisions made as to what singles were released. After &quot;Thank U&quot;, the fabulous &quot;Joining You&quot; should have been an obvious choice for radio. Deciding to go with the diary-like &quot;Unsent&quot; was a poor choice. Waiting to go with the equally fabulous &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; for the live album was another poor choice. On a more positive note, Alanis should be commended for taking on such a creative challenge. There are &quot;Pill&quot;-like songs on here but most are conceived with much more maturity and strength than ever before. &quot;Front Row&quot; is a good lead-off. &quot;Are You Still Mad&quot; reminds one of &quot;Uninvited&quot;. &quot;UR&quot; is a simple song that makes you feel good after listening to it. &quot;One&quot;'s shuffling beat is addictive. &quot;Would Not Come&quot; is just plain unusual - a good thing. The centerpiece of this album though is &quot;Joining You&quot; - a thoughtful, melodic song exuding strength in the lyrics and music. This CD is by no means a disappointment. It is a mature addition to the catalogue of an artist who is growing with every release.
0451191153|5.0|Immediately I opened &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; I was captured.  Rand cuts through society's subterfuge, and amongst the detritus uncovers courage and romance.<br />Roark is obviously the star; but for me, the mixed up Dominique Francon with her passion for Roark, but linkages with the forces that oppose him, sets the high water mark on sexy, powerful female characterization.
B00000DC4A|4.0|I have never been a Bryan Adams fan. His music (and songwriting) has always seemed so childish and immature. His foray into AC ballad land didn't help the situation. However, something happened to change my opinion on this CD. Quite simply, it's the songwriting. His collaborations with Phil Thornalley and, most importantly, Gretchen Peters has raised the level of quality of his music. Unfortuantely, not a whole lot of people got to hear this in the U.S. with the problems over the A+M/Polygram/Universal merger. The Bryan Adams on the title track may have been a bit too much of a shock for them. It's acoustic-rock sound a la Brit Rock was a good departure. The meaty part of this CD is found in the middle with a succession of good songs - &quot;Fearless&quot; sounds great; as does &quot;I'm A Liar&quot;. The studio version of &quot;Cloud Number Nine&quot; is infinitely better than the danced-up single release. And &quot;When You're Gone&quot; is just fun to listen to. A good collection from an artist who seems to be very directionless these days - 2 live albums and 2 greatest hits albums in the space of 5 years?? Come on...
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead can never be accused of being in a mold. Kid A transcends any expectations about these guys; it is a very ambitious release. The album is an excersize in subtlety from the first track to the last. It may seem that the influences of previous releases are missing but they exist underneath. That is Radiohead's talent; keeping the underlying sameness while trying on different masks. The first listen is intresting. Where are Phil Selway's drums? Where are the guitars? Where is Radiohead? They all are here! Subsequent playbacks reveal more and more layers and textures that make Kid A appealing. If you want angst, Pablo Honey is for you. If you want straight forward rock, pull out The Bends. Any Radiohead fan who doesn't like Kid A is afraid of change. Don't be!
B000002C4J|1.0|STEP ONE: Open garbage can lid. STEP TWO: Deposit this CD into can. STEP THREE: Walk away with a satisfied smile on your face, knowing you've done the right thing. <BR>Appealing to the Kathie-Lee, Martha Stewart, rich country-club wife audience...yet again, this stingingly, mind-numbing, same-as-the-past-six-albums CD is a fitting example of how clingy and desperate Dion is to stay on top of the pop charts. With this release, Dion has now successfully brainwashed her audience into continuing to buy her albums even though there is not one ounce of originality in this. Critics alike have put this woman up on a pedastal just because she sells millions of units. Sorry, but millions of dollars in sales does not a good recording make. In fact, the histrionics are worse and there is about as much substance here as there is in a vat of cotton candy. There are hundreds, thousands of better singers out there, with more soul, restraint and sincerity. Dion has only made it to the top because of her appeal to the lowest common denominator - the definitive definition of the word sell-out.<BR>No stars (unfortunately Amazon doesn't have this option) for this rehash of so many other power ballads done over so many other times by Dion, repackaged as \\"new\\". Give me a break.
B00000IPAX|4.0|this cd is cool it has a cool cover and cool songs. this cd isn't that bad it has good songs funny lyrics. i enjoyed this cd i would say give this cd a try its a cool cd
B000000WF0|5.0|5 stars!  Is that all!  Ok...This is just one of the discs that I would want to take with me to my grave should the world explode. No other album I have ever listened to has the appeal this one has. A sonic lover's dream come true. All of the tracks here are layered and textured with such care with so many 'things' going on, that even 4 dozen listens later, I am still discovering new things hidden in the many sounds of this CD. All tracks deserve a listen. Though many people bought this CD on the strength of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, the other treasures found following that song are just as great or greater. &quot;Sonnet&quot; weeps. I cannot listen to &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot; anymore - it's just too depressing, but it's sooooo good. The next six songs are perhaps the greatest collection of songs put together - &quot;Catching The Butterfly&quot; makes you feel you're up in the air with them; &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; brings you back down to earth; &quot;Space And Time&quot; starts with an acoustic guitar, moving quickly to a rock based beat; &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; has some fabulous lyrics to compliment its super sound...&quot;the world don't stop there ain't no time for cracking up believe me friend&quot;. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is, I think, the best song on the CD. It is an anthem to end all anthems. It's acoustic beginning, ending in a stirring crescendo of violins is empowering to say the least. &quot;One Day&quot; delivers a sad sound but a great lyric - &quot;tie yourself to the mast my friend and the storm will end&quot;. The common thread holding these songs together is the music. It's the strongest element at work here. Sonically, it's the best CD with the most unique sounds. More importantly, they work with the lyrics and vocals, not against them. The orchestral sounds give the CD a more visceral strength. Richard Ashcroft is a great wordsmith - his lyrics are potent, socially aware and real. His vocals are sorrowful, sad, inspiring and right on target. This was a fitting end to The Verve, a great display for Richard Ashcroft's talents - now surfacing again with a solo career. Satisfying to the last chord.
B000023VR6|5.0|this is one of those better rap cds u should get it u wont be dissapointed.
0684853523|4.0|We glimpse the teacher King used to be, when he tries to explain how he does, what he does so well. Those students were lucky to have a teacher with passion. You will learn a lot about the writer and some about the man. One gets the feeling the autobiographic material was reduced by more than the suggested 10% in this second draft. The story of how he faced his demons could still be out there, but the privacy he desires is evident. You will be rewarded, whether you write or love to read. I discovered I was almost a character in Green Mile. Good job.
B0000019PA|3.0|I don't get the hype over this album.  I'll agree, there is some really great stuff on here.  &quot;Oh Comely&quot; is very moving, for example.  &quot;The King of Carrot Flowers&quot; has a great absurdist appeal, &quot;In The Aeroplane Over The Sea&quot; is quite enjoyable, &quot;  &quot; is pretty interesting, etc. etc.  There isn't really a bad track here.  Sure, Mangum has a fascinating voice and really knows how to use it (although some of the high notes in &quot;Two-Headed Boy&quot; make me wince a little); sure, these people are a far cry above most 90s pop; sure, the lyrics are fascinating; sure, the best songs are fantastic; sure, Neutral Milk Hotel can be seen as successors to the Incredible String Band.  However, this is not the greatest music ever written!  It's good, competent, interesting avant-garde songwriting, performed in such a way as to make the album a solid, if overlong, listening experience.  But &quot;sonic orgasm&quot;, as one reviewer said, this is not.
B00004XONN|2.0|what happened?  where are the songs?  i just finished listening for the second time, and it seems quite boring.  they may have gotten alittle too full of themselves.  almost 500 reviews and i do not understand any rating above two stars.
0811826848|5.0|This is the book we have all waited for. For almost 30 years we have waited; and MAN!!! Was it ever worth the wait. This book is at first glance; one of the most beautiful books I've ever held in my hands. The paper used is thick, heavy, and smooth as silk. It's a rather large book, which gives the photographs an impact  few books have offered before. Even the shots I've seen before are striking. This is by far the most comprehensive document ever published on the &quot;Fab Four&quot;. So many surprises, so many &quot;little&quot; details that only the boys could know. Everything about the &quot;Anthology&quot; project has been done with such loving care, and this book is no exception. The beatles have given the world so much over the past four decades; and now, with this rich impressive chronicle, they give us their own personal recollections of a time when the world was just beginning to learn how to ROCK!!! Thank you, John, Paul, George, Ringo, George Martin, Neil Aspinall, Mal Evans, Derek Taylor, Klas Voorman, and Yoko Ono. This is without doubt; the &quot;Ultimate&quot; book on &quot;The Beatles&quot;. Still the most influential band in the history of Rock n' Roll.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Turned on by the Roswell opening track, I purchased this CD. I did not know the rest of the CD would be as good- or better.  It is.  I bought a few of these to give friends.  Great sounds.  Etherial, melodic. High Recommendation.
B000002A3T|1.0|gilmour and team floyd (which includes the semi-useful wright and useless mason, as well as a team of outside song writers, and daves wife) managed to put together an album that sounds like a pink floyd cover band trying to write their own songs, but failing miserably. and before all you gilmour-philes go off thinking im blinded by some odd pro roger stance, im not, i think pros and cons is decent (better than anything &quot;floyd&quot; put out after he left) yet not great and radio kaos,  well i prefer to forget that album exists (amused to death however, is one the greatest albums ive ever heard, but moving on...) this album simply lacks the feeling of an original floyd album, and truely doesnt deserve to have the name pink floyd on it. i can get together 10 song writer and my girlfriend to write songs for me too,  does that mean i get to call my self pink floyd? a cold and boring album from start to finish, i was left wondering why i bothered to buy it, esspecially after hearing the even more dismal and not floydian momentary lapse... album. i guess i was just hoping that &quot;pink floyd&quot; could not dissapoint two times in a row.
0131103628|5.0|I learnt C with this book. Although C now evolves into the ISO standard, you still can learn a lot from this book. I believe any novices in C will also understand the content, as it is clear, concise and illustrative.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I would not recommend this CD to children under the age of 10 or so. This music is awesome and I love listening to his CD's but it does have a lot of bad words on there that u might now want your kids to hear. But if you like rap and stuff like that this is the CD for you!. Eminem has new and improved songs on the album which I like a lot better then the old album the best song on the Eminem CD I think would be \\"kim\\"!. the songs are good and so is the CD cover I recommend this CD for all you people over the age of 10.!

B00004X01U|2.0|Wow, I am scared.  Madonna's &quot;Music&quot; simply shows her arrogance even more then it has been seen before.  She thinks that she can pull of French disco beats.  Well, I'm really sorry Madonna, but you can't!  This CD is so weird, it's scary.  Madonna is a complete psycho, who should realize that she is too out of it to keep up with today's music world.  Next we'll be seeing her getting her groove on with Nelly or something.  Everyone always likes to talk about Madonna &quot;reinventing herself in such a unique way&quot;, but when you think about it, all she does is go along with a certain bizarre trend that has caught on at the moment, all the while thinking she is the coolest thing since sliced bread.  Get over yourself Madonna, because you bite.  I give you two stars for throwing yourself to the dogs with this new, hideous representation of what we are to call music. MADONNA IS DISGUSTING.
B00003CXGP|5.0|This is of the rare cases where the movie is better than the book.  Actually, the movie is pretty much a literal interpretation of the book (lines and all) sans the over-the-top violence (which wouldn't have made it past the censors anyway).  Thanks to a magnificent performance by Christian Bale, the movie actually improves on the dark humor in the book (a parody of the 80s) by making Bateman a parody of a serial killer. Having said this, the book definitely helps one better understand some of the more obscure aspects of the movie (like the interchangability of all the 'vice presidents' working for Pierce &amp; Pierce).  The most perfect '80s moment' of the movie was Bateman's confrontation with the real estate agent selling Paul Allen's condo.  She must have known he was connected to the bodies found in the condo, but chose to ask him to leave instead of exposing him (as the latter course would ruin the resale value of the property).  Makes you wonder which of those two had the stronger killer instinct.
0792846443|5.0|What can I say?  This is a masterpiece.  I read the book first and I loved the book, but when I saw the movie, I was taken away by it.  Being from a family that doesn't really like even a little violence (this movie only has a bit of violence) I was really the only one who liked it.  This movie is absolutely amazing.    I can only say that Kathy Bates definitely deserved her academy award for the role as the psychotic/friendly/depressed/#1 fan Annie Wilkes.  Her different words that she used to describe added a little humor, some of them being: &quot;You dirty bird!&quot; and &quot;Ooogy!&quot;.      On the topic of humor, Richard Farnsworth was really funny as the town's sherrif (among other jobs).  He was perfect for the role and I do not think that someone else could have filled his shoes.      As for the main character, Paul Sheldon, James Caan also did a fantastic job portraying a man in a blizzard amount of pain from his car accident.  The way that he humored Annie Wilkes in the movie was in a way funny also.  In some scenes when Paul's legs kept getting hurt, it was almost hurtful to watch his expressions because James Caan really made you believe that he was in a lot of pain.  I'm a bit surprised that James Caan did not also win an oscar for this role because he really did give a wonderful performance as Paul Sheldon.    So in other words, you really should see this movie and of course read the book.  There are some scenes that are just fantastic.  I think that if you read the book first before the movie, you will understand the movie better.  I sure did.  I would also recommend seeing the Stephen King movies: The Tommyknockers, and The Shining.  Both are exceptional movies.
B000000HU1|5.0|Gong end their trilogy (Flying Teapot,Angel's Egg are the others) with this beatiful masterpiece. It's a raving sampler of psychedelic dreams, delicate fairytales, superb musicianships and great sounds (it's still amazing how good was the recording and the mixing of this album, considering it was 1974). David Allen, Gilli Smyth and the others will fly you to a sideral dimension where you will meet strange creatures (the Pothead Pixies, who are the core of Gong's mythology), you will enjoy every possible kind of sound, the final result being you hooked forever to Gong music, spending a lot of money buying all their CDs!:-)) If you can, see them live if you're so lucky to get them around....it's been a strange, strange experience....
B000001ES9|2.0|Unless you're a Rush completist you can safely avoid this album.  The songwriting is unremarkable and the lyrics are painfully bad (though the pseudointellectual nonsense of later albums is absent).  &quot;In the Mood&quot; may be the most ridiculously goofy thing they ever recorded.  The attempt to clone Zeppelin is pretty obvious and results in a bluesy sound on some tunes.  Other than &quot;Finding My Way&quot; and &quot;Working Man&quot; (where they demonstrate their developing instrumental prowess), this one is mostly forgettable.
0684853523|5.0|I read the autobiographical part of this magnificent book with my heart in my throat, and resolved to read the rest over and over again.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Stephen King.  My writing will never be the same.
B00004W50T|5.0|Before I bought this CD I had only heard The Weight and it was the main reason I bought this CD.  To put it simply I was blown away by it.  This album is the reason Eric Clapton disbanded cream and it is easy to see why.  Every aspect of this album is beautiful and every song is great, not one stands out above the rest.  I have since compiled a large collection of The Band, but this one will always be my favorite.  The blending of the three voices is heard most on this album, with Richard Manuels standing out the most.  In my opinion his voice is one of the most beautiful ever, and one listen of I shall be released should convince anyone of this.  The album is a drastic departure from anything being recorded around the same time.  It starts of with a slow song, Tears of Rage, very uncommon for the day.  The songs all have a very old feel to them, and there is a lot of gospel flavor incoporated into them.  It is basically the perfect album.  Every band member was equally important to every song and each is one of the best at their respective instrument.  In my opinion this is one of the best albums ever and this new remastered version is even better.  The bonus tracks are pretty interesting especially if you don't already own the basement tapes.  If you are looking to get into The Band start with this album and work your way through their catalog. It is the kind of album that gets better each time you listen to it and no music fan should be without it.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Don't think that you have to have seen the movie &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; to enjoy this CD. Although the music in the film is in itself a supporting character,the soundtrack stands on its own. Tracks like&quot;I've Seen It All&quot; &amp; &quot;Cvalda&quot; have the same kind of emotion that was found on Homogenic. The CD is just about a half hour long, it's worth having not just because it is a truly beautiful score for an Oscar worthy film but because it will move you. You can feel how dear this project was to Bjork.

The blending of the three voices is heard most on this album, with Richard Manuels standing out the most.  In my opinion his voice is one of the most beautiful ever, and one listen of I shall be released should convince anyone of this.  The album is a drastic departure from anything being recorded around the same time.  It starts of with a slow song, Tears of Rage, very uncommon for the day.  The songs all have a very old feel to them, and there is a lot of gospel flavor incoporated into them.  It is basically the perfect album.  Every band member was equally important to every song and each is one of the best at their respective instrument.  In my opinion this is one of the best albums ever and this new remastered version is even better.  The bonus tracks are pretty interesting especially if you don't already own the basement tapes.  If you are looking to get into The Band start with this album and work your way through their catalog. It is the kind of album that gets better each time you listen to it and no music fan should be without it.
B00004XONN|5.0|Once the opening of &quot;everything in its right place&quot; started I knew that Thom Yorke had gone completely mad. Not that him going mad is a bad thing. This is one of the most experimental albums I've heard in a long long time. <br />The vocals are few but when he actually does sing on &quot;how to disappear competely&quot;, it's fantastic! The disillusionment of OK Computer evolved into something of disaffected disdain.<br />In short, this is an incredible album. But only for the open minded listener. It rewards with time and most would probably only appreciate it after the 5th or so listen. Hey, I took a year to fully appreciate OK Computer...Whatever the case, the future of music for the next 10 years or so has RADIOHEAD stamped all over it
0679736646|5.0|Although &quot;Ubik&quot; wasn't the first Philip K. Dick novel I read (having read just about all of them now, it's hard to remember which was first, but I think it was &quot;Martian Time-Slip&quot;), I would recommend it as the best starting point for someone trying to decide if PKD is your cup of tea.  &quot;Ubik&quot; has all of the major elements of the typical PKD novel (to the extent there is any typicality): (1) questioning of the meaning of reality; (2) an almost pathetic sense of humor in the face of the unraveling of reality; (3) an everyman protagonist; and (4) extreme readability despite a somewhat pedestrian writing style.<br />The plot can be summed up like this: some humans have psychic powers, but rather than being seen as heroes (as is the case in most sci-fi), they're possible sources of invasions of your privacy.  Never fear, however, because some humans have developed anti-psychic powers -- they block the powers of the others.  A bunch of anti-psychics go on a mission, but something goes wrong and they barely get away with their lives.  Almost immediately, they notice that something is not right.  Phone directories are out of date, coffee is disgustingly stale, and so on.  Time, it seems, is flowing backwards!<br />For readers who aren't aware, PKD was one of the most influential sci-fi writers, with his reality-warping stories.  His interest in this topic can be traced, no doubt, to his youthful experimentation with narcotics -- an experience recounted largely in &quot;A Scanner Darkly.&quot;<br />PKD was an incredibly prolific writer; he wrote something like 16 novels in a five year stretch in the late-1960s, including &quot;Ubik.&quot;  Many of his best novels were written during that stretch.  If you like &quot;Ubik,&quot; I would suggest in no particular order: &quot;The Gameplayers of Titan,&quot; &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (made into the movie &quot;Bladerunner&quot;), &quot;Dr. Bloodmoney,&quot; and &quot;The Man in the High Castle.&quot;  By the 1970's, PKD stopped writing as many novels, and they became more thematically complex, with increasing emphasis on religious spirituality.
0446677450|4.0|This book has changed the way I look at money.  I am not happy where I work and this book gives me a lot of ideas for becoming financially independent.  <br />I would recommend you read this easy read, and hope you use the knowledge that you gain from it.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day is the best alternative rock band on the face of the  earth!  While still retaining that same in your face, &quot;I don't need your authority&quot; style, they have expanded their horizons with great leaps and bounds. It sounds impossible, but they pulled it off. This is definintley their best album out of their other five albums. If you listen to one song off of every album up to Warning, you can hear their style maturing and expanding. This cd has nothing but good, catchy songs with great lyrics and awesome guitar riffs. Green Day has fine tuned their songwriting abilities so that no song is bad. From the haunting rhythm of &quot;Warning&quot;, to the hard rock of &quot;Blood, Sex, and Booze&quot;&amp;&quot;Castaway&quot;. There's even &quot;Misery&quot;, which has a Russian/Spanish beat, &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;, an acoustic ballad, or the single &quot;Minority&quot;, which has really funny lyrics if you listen. Green Day has come a long way from 1039 Slappy Hours, and they are still the best alternative band ever! If you're a green day fan, get this cd, if you like alternative music, get this cd. You won't regret it!
B00004XONN|5.0|It's said that a fine wine needs time to breathe, allowing each subsequent sip to grow and change.  And as time, temperature, and exposure affect change, the wine reveals itself for that which it truly is. Until at last the bottle is dry.  Mysteriously, no matter how precisely you attempt to replicate the circumstances under which you experience the wine, any subsequent tasting will offer a different dynamic.  So it is with Kid A.  On first listen, I strained to catch every last meaning and found myself at times perplexed.  On the second listen, I closed my eyes and allowed the melodic nature of this album to wash over me and through me.  On the third listen I got it right.  Kid A is by far Radiohead's most clandestine effort, to the point that it boarders on an inside joke.  Anachronistic at times, or at least given to private allusions, the album is best experienced without preconception.  Like some strange amalgam of themselves, Mercury Rev, William James, and Miles Davis the music is infused with sonic subtlety, poignant fatalism, and just enough pragmatism to let us know that it's all going to be as okay as it's going to be.  Perhaps an antidote for OK Computer and perhaps a further evolved version of the same, Kid A is no less impressive or significant.  And like wine, it drowns reason.
0790736942|5.0|I recently had seen The Exorcist in its newly rereleased theatrical form with additional footage not seen in the 1973 version.I was glued to the screen.I wouldn't dare move from the seat I was sitting on.Just to watch this classic on the big screen was a special treat for me.I love horror films so watching this film,I knew that I would enjoy it.
B000006SQ0|5.0|This is the Barclay James Harvest album that introdused me to Barclay James Harvest. It caputured me, I played it again and again. Later I baught all the other albums.  <br />The classic songs from Child of Univers, Poor Mans Moody blues, Mocingbird, Taking me Higher, Suicide and Hymn are given a new dimension from the original soundtracks.  The songs have a stronger dynamical and emotional feeling that goes straight to your heart.  Guitarist John Lees, bassplayer Les Holroy and keaybordist Wooly Wolstenholme all gives their distinct voices to some incredible good harmonies.  Together with drummer Mel Pritchard they are one of the most underrated bands of the 70's.  It's not to late to discover them, try this album first!<br />My favourite song?  All of them
B00000JWVO|5.0|Wow! More than just a Sunday afternoon musical. With frenetic energy and unending choreographic magic, the actors in this adaptation of T.S. Elliott's poems about Jellicle cats, bring a feline feel to the stage.  You can't help but be intrigued by the makeup while you enjoy the voices of this wonderful cast. In a world in which you sometimes wonder what you can let the kids watch, Andrew Lloyd Webber comes through once more. But don't imagine for a moment that these children's poems give rise to a movie only for the wee ones -- you'll sit enthralled as you try to figure out what in the world these cats mean as they each tell their stories in hopes of gaining the Heavyside Layer. You'll want to watch this video more than once to squeeze every bit of enjoyment out of it that you can. This is a &quot;must have&quot; addition to anyone's musical collection.
0811826848|5.0|It's The Beatles... Buy it.
B00004X01U|1.0|Madonna's latest does not stand up against her previous releases.  Music is by far the best song on the entire CD.  Some critics state this album is similar to her &quot;Erotica&quot; days; however, I don't see it.
B00004XQP4|5.0|The first impression when listening to the CD is that it doesn't seem the Green Day's music, it is very acoustic and very slow, but when continuing listening you realize that the letters are fantastic and the songs are all incredible, you will be singing them down the street all the time because they are great.<br />  My favorite Green Day albums are the Kerplunk and 1039, I love their oldest songs, Dookie is excellent too and I believe that with Warning they have taken a great step in its musical style, creating an album that MUST be in the collection of everyone who likes the good music. (sorry about my english, It's not very good ;))
6301562143|5.0|Director Tim Burton and Michael Keaton team up to create THE Batman. Every bit of this movie is entertaining. Keaton plays his dual roles perfectly. His Batman is one that nobody will forget. The plot flows smoothly. Jack Nicholson stars as the Joker. Nicholson is so perfect with this part that I think he should've played it again! The music is top notch and provides the necessary mood- which is dark. The whole atmosphere in this movie is great. It's one you want to watch over and over!!
0671042858|2.0|I believe this book would be interesting for baseball fans . Unless you're familiar with the game it wouldnlt work for you as it didn't for me.<br />  It's an ordinary King's,containing some of his recurring motives ,and doesn't really innovate much. The main title is the inclusion of the game in the story ,as a main character . I didn't find it appealing, but as I adressed earlier, others can .<br />  I did not find the overall concept gripping, I actually browsed the book at some parts - for the first time in a King's novel. Maybe that says it all.This work isn't one of his finest, and it seems to me that he wrote it for self entertainment reasons ,since his love of the game is definite.<br />  One more point I would like to bring up is the distinct feeling of a minor reading . The entire story deals with the little kid and her thoughts, most of which don't seem to capture my attention. King hasn't done it for me this time. For instance, in &quot;Insomnia&quot; he touched my feelings ,when he ,so delicately,  described the lives of old folks ,their problems and emotions, but this time it wasn't that successful. I was dissapionted.<br />You might or might not ,but consider carefully before spending your money.

B00004XONN|1.0|I wasn't expecting &quot;OK Computer, Part II&quot; or anything...but I did expect a more coherent, even, but provocative album.  Unfortunately, the only thing provocative about &quot;Kid-A&quot; is its sheer noisiness. I've already read critical reviews hailing &quot;Kid A&quot; as a &quot;rock opera&quot; as a &quot;redefinition of rock&quot;.  Puh-leeeeeze!!!  By no means is this &quot;rock&quot;.  You insult the likes of all the greats that came before, i.e. the Beatles, Stones, and Zeppelin by showering this paltry album with such underserved lofty praise.<br />I've no doubt that Yorke and Co. are brilliant.  The excellence of &quot;OK, Computer&quot; is a testament to that.  But with &quot;Kid A&quot; it's as though the band were all too aware and conscious of the phenomenal success of &quot;OK, Computer&quot; and in trying to top that success, that they altogether didn't even try to and instead went in a completely opposite direction in trying to be &quot;different&quot;.  Unfortunately, &quot;Kid-A&quot; is the direct result of that misguided sojourn.<br />I am immensely disappointed with &quot;Kid-A&quot;.  I'm all for redefining a genre of music, which I suppose, &quot;Kid-A&quot; is trying to do with rock.  But if the redefinition of rock sounds this bad, then BRING BACK ZEPPELIN, STONES, AND THE BEATLES!
B00004TJK2|5.0|Man was the dream of the Dolphin...
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This movie is a perfect example of Hollywood's love of special effects, and disregard of realism.  Everything in this movie explodes in a blinding flash of gasoline.  The sinking of the German destroyer is arguably the greatest departure from realism.  <br />The plot is weak and far too predictable, what passes for foreshadowing is so simplistic, a six-year-old recognizes it.  In addition, there are far too many unexplained incidents, the worst of which occurs early in the movie when the U-571 is disabled by depth charges from the British Navy, and the sub has no choice but to surface.  And guess what?  Suddenly, the British Navy is nowhere to be seen! Of course, if realism were a concern, the sub would surface and be blown out of the water by the destroyer and the movie would be over. <br />Don't buy this movie.  If you have to see it, go rent it...one viewing will be sufficient.
0793927501|4.0|There should be more survivor movies like this! Its very good! Charles Morse(Anthongy Hopkins) is a billionaire who accompanies his much younger wife, Mickey(Elle MacPherson) on a photo shoot in Alaska. After being there for a day or two Charles is convinced to go for a plane ride with Bob(Alec Baldwin), Mickey's camera man and his assistant Stephen. But the plane crashes and they land in the middle of nowhere. The three are forced to find there way home through the knowledge of Charles. There is also a subplot of Charles suspecting Bob of having an affair with Mickey. Which is nicely added in. Among other things that I like about this movie like the scenery, the plot, and the bear, I really like Hopkins' character. He is so inventive and smart. See this movie, its a guarrenteed thriller! Rated R for violence and language.
B000002UB3|5.0|Hard to believe mine is the first review to be recorded here.  I remember the night I first heard this album in 1969.  There's a reason this ended up the Beatles best-selling album...The Music.  Powerful,sweet, melodic, silly, masterful, incomparable.  No band ever had a more monumental and lasting swan song.  Listen and appreciate the genius that four of them together (with George Martin's wonderful assistance) created.
0790733226|1.0|Bad script, lame acting and over the top directing do not a good movie make. Where did they go wrong? 1. You never really experience the suspention of disbelief which is so critical for the genre. 2. The entire flick takes itself too seriously. 3. The film has a bad &quot;government coverup&quot; angle that looks lifted from an X Files episode. 4. You have noreason to have sympathy for any of the characters.<br />Do yourself a big favor and see Kubrick's 2001, a classic that blows the socks off of this little flick. Even &quot;Close Encounters of Third Kind&quot; while nor being a favorite of mine has more humor and tells a much better story. Back to film school for the cast and crew of &quot;Contact&quot;! They could learn a few things about the genre by watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone, which had some good writing and drama...
6300271145|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Wish I could get it on DVD for my collection. If you've seen it once, you will watch it again and again.
6305205620|5.0|This is almost as good as being at the concert.  The DVD has an excellent picture and sound quality.  Forget about the S&amp;M DVD with the symphony. This is the one to get.
B000001Y5D|2.0|Really... I have to be honest... &quot;What's Up&quot; is really the only good song on here.  Sorry.  The last song was ok I guess... although I can't remember it too well.  I'm looking for things to impress me but I'm just not finding it.
B000001GRZ|5.0|Mr. McLellan's brief review for Amazon is dead on!  Pierre Fournier's by now classic recording of the Bach Suites remains unchallenged, and the joy of the Kapellmeister is its everlasting motive!  There simply is no rival to this rendition of these spiritual classics.  The only other claimant on the horizon would be the version by Janos Starker; yet for all of Starker's understanding of Bach's invigorated masterpieces, I don't believe his conception is as cultured or his over-arching execution as fine as that of Fournier.  The great assuredness of the Prelude of the first Suite is sweetened by Fournier's rich thought, and his handling of the Prelude of the sixth Suite, with its climbing 1-3-1-5-1-8 pattern, is so humanly drawn- like an illuminated letter in a Book of Hours!  -well, as the French say, comparison is no comparison!  The fifth Suite with its famous Sarabande hangs like a late afternoon in Sainte-Chapelle!  This is art ineffacable and indispensable.  Forget Ma's interpretation- he plays it like a schoolboy; Rostropovich is inconstant; Casals ends by offering more Casals than Bach; Heinrich Schiff goes deep but cannot be said to have wagered with Time itself in essaying these Suites - there is impatience in his probing version.  Maisky, whose playing is always informed and beautiful, often keeps himself from the very joy that wings from Fournier's body and bow!  Fournier doesn't perform, he holds court; and an audience with his Sebastian Bach is more rewarding by leagues than mere regal favor.  Listen and be ennobled; here is art beholden to the gods.
B000002HPT|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this CD does have its high points.  But none of this is new to me. And I feel it important to recognize what this CD could have been.  I feel the long songs didn't have to be so long, and the bad songs didn't have to be there at all. I feel this score should have been a five, but the inspiring moments were tainted by an annoying kind of blandness.  And I really wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't listened to the album over again. This is one of those CDs that just loses its sparkle the more you listen to it, and I was afraid to listen to it anymore just to maintain the 7 score.  Somehow, I feel it should've been an 8.
B000000OEI|5.0|It is a wonder why this score did not win an academy award.  However, it did succeed in winning a Grammy, a whole flock of new score fans, and many Hans Zimmer fans.  It is a great score to listen to on its own, but not only that, it makes Crimson Tide one of the best movies around.  From the onset of &quot;Mutiny&quot;, with its soft guitaral element to the final track, &quot;Roll Tide&quot; and the &quot;Eternal Father Strong To Save Hymn&quot; at the end, the score will captivate and amaze you.  The first time I heard the theme from this score, was on a trailer for &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which was a very anticipated movie indeed (as is &quot;Pearl Harbour&quot;, which uses the theme to &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, and also brought my attention to that score!)  Hans Zimmer has outdone himself here.  The only setback is the length of the two tracks, &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;1SQ&quot;.  Although, once I started listening to &quot;Alabama&quot;, I couldn't stop!  That is how amazing this score is.  One other thing...One of Hans Zimmer's biggest fans is Steven Spielberg, because of listening to this Perfect Score.  Is it any wonder why Hans Zimmer now scores for Dreamworks?
0448060191|5.0|I had to read this book for a high school English project. I thought the book was very informative. Im a very picky reader and I can not read a book with boring spots, but i can assure you this book was good. I found no boring spots. I didn't wanna put the book down, event after event, it kept on coming. I encourage you to read this book whether your 14 years old or 60 years old. It teaches good moral values.
0684853523|5.0|This is a must read for aspiring and experienced writers. The first part of the book is a memoir which provides a funny, sweet, recollection of King's life growing up, and then the struggles he faced to get published...Carrie, his first published novel was actually the fourth novel he wrote. (The first three were eventually published).<br />The second part of the book provides a writer's &quot;Toolbox&quot; and clear, challenging advice to writers to strive to be their best no matter where they are in talent or process. King's advice will inspire every writer to work harder and smarter.
0553573403|5.0|This book is awesome!  When you read it, you have to have that whole day free, because once you pick it up, you're not going to put it back down.  Each chapter is from the point of view of a different character, so you're always left hanging when a chapter ends.  It has less magic in it than most fantasy books, but all that means is that a character can't just wave his hands and win a war.  With so many different points of view, the two (or more) characters you end up rooting for might even be each others' enemies!
B00003CXDU|1.0|I givita one. I went to this movie with some friends over stuart Little, and I wish I woulda went to stuart little instead! This movie was NOT worth it, unless u like those kinda movies like My favorite martian and inspector gadget. I was in total boredom, I wasn't even barely paying attention to the movie after a while.
B00004XONN|5.0|I had been awaiting this album for so long. OK Computer and The Bends are two of my favorite albums, and I really wanted some new material. Although Kid A isn't as good as OK Computer or maybe even The Bends, it is still excellent. Kid A is Radiohead's darkest and most experimental album to date. Tracks such as &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; rely only on a keyboard beat and samples and strings and organs respectivly. &quot;The National Anthem&quot; evokes feelings of complete confusion and chaos while &quot;Treefingers&quot; is a very intriguing instrumental. &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; is a very beautiful and haunting song. It is one of the best Radiohead songs I've heard to date. Thom's voice really shines on this track. &quot;Optomistic&quot; is another favorite of mine; I love how it switches to the jazzy beat in the end. The only track I wasn't feeling too much was the title track which is a little to experimental for its own good. Overall, Kid A may take some time to get used to, but it shows that Radiohead is always taking their music and new directions while still remaining to be one of the best bands out there.
6300214753|5.0|This movie is way good! youull pry luv Mathew Broderick after seeing this movie, I know I do! It's got some pretty funny parts, Its about a high school senior, Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick) who plays sick to get out of school on a perfect day. his best buddy is for real home sick and ferris pryes him out of the bed and they go hang out and bail a girl outta school, and they all go hang out and spend a day off. It's awsome!
B00000J7JO|5.0|Its official and its known that the Red hot chili peppers are the best thing that happened to rock ever. They have continuallly experimented and churned out albums of magnificent musical quality. They are the embodiment and soul of funk rock and are invincible. Their recent adventure -Californication is a milestone ion their career even people who hated them in the begining now love their wholesome user friendly music on californication. It is truly a masterpiece. The best songs on this album are californication, This velvet glove and Emit Remmus.<br />Each song stands for something wholesome and very soulful. These songs are the type that i listen to thru the whole night. They make me so happy and they really warp my mind. The feeling i get is just too good to be true and is indescribable.<br />This album is definitely not for fans of pop. Though some people classify this album as pop (I dont know why its pure unadulterated rock.).<br />The album is complete in all elements. And it is highly reccomended. I also reccomend One hot minute as well as blood sugar sex magik. The pppers are great guys. In fact i suggest a little research into the band before delving into thier work. They are the most interesting people on earth.<br />Please try the albu listen to it at a friends place or something and dont be critical let their music and lyrics seep into u. then u will realize theyre worth. Just give it a try U will love it. but make sure u have the lyrics as reference . They are excellent.<br />Hope i have proved helpful please dont be too critical try and see for urself<br />Ciao
B00004XQP4|5.0|This CD is just so cool.  All of the songs just have so much substance.  It's so fantastic.  I love the lyrics and the tune of the songs.  I love how they did different things on this album.  The way that they put so many different instruments in is totally cool.  I agree that each song could stand as its own album.  It's just the best album that I have heard in a long time.  I suggest you buy this immediately.
6304244304|1.0|I must have been naive in my younger days, because there was I time I was anxious to watch this film.  It looked intriguing, with a lot of potential to be a classic sci-fi thriller.  Ha, not even a director of such talent as John Frankenheimer could save this mess.  Considering the fact it stars the lifeless Val Kilmer and the overacting of Marlon Brando, acting isn't much in this film.  As a matter of fact, David Thewlis and Fairuza Balk deliver far better performances.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is so awesome! I am so happy that I bought it because now I have the best Metallica CD ever made. If I had to choose between any of the Metallica CD's, I would definetely choose this one as my first choice. OK well bye everybody I hope my review helped you make your choice!
B00004YM0D|4.0|Not only was this movie the best I've seen this season, the soundtrack is just as exhilarting. The movie actually gave me chills, thinking of how things were then, and the struggle the men had to go through. The soundtrack was created perfectly to add to the excitement.  The songs fit perfectly with each new scene. I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre and get it!!!
B00004U2A1|5.0|This completely blows the first release of the Evil Dead II on DVD! If you are a fan you will never get over the quality that goes into the THX mastered version in video and audio (obviously)!! I would never point a Evil dead fan in the wrong direction. This will be a treasured addition with out a doubt. Get it now and forever be entertained!!!!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Even the opening credits capture you the moment you see them with the haunted music of a dying empire as the title appears and the opening scene of Russel Crowe as the long suffering contemplative general, every nuance of his face describes his stricken life full of the hard gruesome days fighting barbarians for the last 12 years. So starts one of the greatest films I have seen, with these scences you are caught up immediately in the tale of a great man. Strangely enough the supremely beautiful scene where Maximus the general watches a bird alight on a branch is never mentioned by reviewers, considering its eloquence and almost zen-like aside as life continues in the most horror filled times. The battle scenes are incredible with the full might of the supremely trained and confident Roman army unleashing hell as Crowe put it in the film, such terror the barbarians must have felt being crushed under foot by the superior technological ability of the Romans. The film does not dwell on this but rather fully encapsulates the viewer within the fight scenes as man battles man. Maximus's decline as general in the political battles taking place for Emperorship fling him into slavery and to fight as a gladiator, at every moment Maximus remains human never becoming too much of a hero but staying vulnerable and yet noble and loyal with great strength of character, the sort of man other men would love and follow into battle or anywhere else for that matter. The death of Maximus at the end allows real tears to be shed for a great man indeed. An incredible experience, more than a film. Only &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; has done this better.
0783243499|1.0|Here is the plot in a nutshell: Bateman kills a lot of people. The End (Really).<br />Maybe I just don't get it, but I TRULY thought this movie was bad. No, not just bad.....appallingly dreadful really. It's supposed to be a satire, but I just can't see the humor in watching a naked man chase a prostitute with a chainsaw. The scenes of gratuitous sex and violence are kind of extreme, and the message is trite: Bateman lives a life of material excess and thus is numb to ordinary pleasures, forcing him to find his only source of fulfillment in murder. You watch the film, hoping, praying even that there is actually a point here, but sadly, the ending just leaves you even more confused.  I feel like such an idiot for watching this movie; I want my money back.......
B00004XONN|4.0|I must admit after my very first listen of Kid A, I was kind of disappointed. But, I decided to at least give it a couple more listens before making any final judgements on it. I am SO glad that I did because this album has grown on me in a major way! It is a little difficult for the ears at first, song structures that are the bedrock of almost all rock tunes (verse, chorus, bridge etc.) are tossed by the wayside. What Radiohead does give us is an eerie yet incredibly beautiful WHOLE ALBUM (the last time that happened with anyone in mainstream music was OK Computer)! <br />So why only four stars? I've only been listening to the album for four days, and even though it hasn't left my disk changer in that time I still cannot call it a classic just yet. But I still would encourage anyone who wants a break from the mindless and repeatitive stuff on radio and MTV right now to check out Kid A!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Ohhhhhhh My god what kind of a film is that.It is wonderful It takes the viewer inside it.I watched this film 3 times in theater  it is good as American Pie.When I first watched this movie I was shocked cause I have not watched a comedy film like this.Everybody should own one.Strictly Recommended.
B00004YM0D|5.0|This soundtrack brings the best part of Remember the Titans to life.  The duirng the whole movie I was singing in a low pitch to all of the fimiliar songs I know. Though the soundtrack does not include every popular song used in the movie (i.g. James Taylor's passion-filled Fire and Rain), it has plenty of soul to accompany the well-thought out movie.  Five stars and two large thumbs up to this soundtrack. Excellent choice.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This film is wonderful.I liked it very much Its story is well written and its screenplay is well designed.Everybody should own one.Strictly Recommended.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Special effects will always amaze me. Especially when they are as unobtrusive as in Gladiator. Love, hate, action and torment will keep you in the story. All this while enjoying ancient architecture. You do not watch this movie, you are in it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I can not bleive that.This film is wonderful.It contains everyhing It has fun,romance,honour and violance.The best movie of the century.Everybody should own one especially the dvd version.Strictly Recommended.
B00004ZEQX|4.0|After a fantastic start which has definite echos of 'The Shining', this film ups the gore content leaving you feel quite sick by the end.  As ever, Fulci treats us to a multitude of strong gore scenes, inculding the most ridiculous bat attack ever filmed!  Not as good as 'Zombie' but better than 'The Black Cat' or 'The Beyond' (which I don't particularly like), House has soem great performances, some cheesy, but hey, what where you expecting? If you are ven slightly interested in the 'golden era' of Fulci horror then you wil want to check this movie out, i doubt that you will be disappointed.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Firstly I should say that this film is well made.Its so wonderful.The colouring of the movie is excellent it has a gothic mood.The music is good , the pictures sre good eveything in this film are well designed.Collectors should own one.Strictly Recommended.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|The metal gods are back with a brand new album, Brave New World.  The tracks The Wicker Man, Brave New World, Out of the Silent Planet, and The Thin Line Between Love And Hate are the ones that stand out for me, yet all the songs are great.  They're got a little sailor thing going on with tis album, and what can I say, it works!  May many more albums come from these great gods of metal!
0767832248|5.0|This movie is probably one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  Who'd of thought that Robin Williams and Robert De Niro could make as good a duo as this.  The emotion let out in this film is like none I've ever seen before.  Robert De Niro is amazing as the patient in the hospital.  You wont hear a lot out of him in the first quarter but once he starts, you'll wonder is he's the one acting or not. The dramatic power int this movie is just amazing.  So for those of you who like to be touched inside, grab a box of kleenex and prepare to shed some tears, this movie's for you.
B000002HH2|3.0|I enjoy the music on this CD.  Bjrk does some amazing and outrageous things with her voice, once again.  IT's OH SO QUIET, a 1940's tune by Hanslang-Reisfeld, is a roller coaster of big band sound -- at once quiet then explosive.  Bjrk displays interesting and unique perspective in her lyrics.  HYPER-BALLAD is a complex statement of relationships.  We live on a mountain / right at the top / there's a beautiful view / from the top of the mountain / every morning I walk towards the edge / and throw little things off / like / car-parts, bottles and cutlery / or whatever I find lying around / it's become a habit / a way / to start the day / I go through all this / before you wake up / so I can feel happier / to be safe up here with you /   Not your standard girl-meets-boy pop sentiment.  THE MODERN THINGS contains a perceptive insight on the role of gadgets.  I am intriqued and challenged by the music on this CD.  If you are interested in songs sung well which are extremely unique, this CD will interest you.
B00004X01U|5.0|This album is really Madonna's best. I have to say that the coolest songs from the album are: Music, Runaway Lover, I Deserve It, Nobody's Perfect, Don't Tell Me, What It Feels Like For A Girl, and Gone.  You must have this album, and if you're not a Madonna fan I promise you'll be a Madonna fan after hearing this AMAZING CD!!
B00000J2PH|5.0|I enjoy the music on this CD very much.  Many, many other people apparently feel the same way because, in the early 70's, TAPESTRY was on the Billboard Pick 100 for more than 250 weeks -- a record at the time.  Sometimes, when I listen to this music, it strikes me as maudlin and whiney.  Other times, it seems to express exactly what I am feeling.   When I feel lonely, I often hear Carole King sing, &quot;So far away / Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more? &quot;  If you are interested in beautiful music with insightful and sensitive lyrics, or you are interested in folk music of the early seventies, this CD will be interesting to you.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie was absolutely awesome. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole movie, trying to figure it out, and  at the end I fell off of my seat. Brad Pitt plays a great villain, and Edward Norton does a great job as Mr. Rational...
B00003CXDF|1.0|I have to admit, I am not an 'action movie' person, but I HAD quite enjoyed 'Mission Impossible 1', and thought the sequal might be vaguely entertaining.<br />It wasn't.<br />The plot involved secret potions, killer viruses, test tubes and these 'mask' things which people would sport to look like OTHER people, fooling them completely even whilst KISSING!<br />In short - this movie was absurd.  The 'fight scenes' went on FOREVER (no, really - for EVER!), and it was all just very silly and rather pointless. <br />The best thing I can say about this movie is that the soundtrack had a pretty cooking bass line...and that Tom Cruise has REALLY good hair in it!<br />Sorry, Amazon - but I've got to tell it like it is: Mission Impossible 2 is total rubbish (but I'd LOVE to know what sort of conditioner that Cruise guy is using!)
B0000296SI|5.0|i admit it. i have not been the most obsessed Blink 182 fan out there, but they rule!!!! i love Adam's Song. All the small things rocks! i totally disagree with anyone who thinks they're immature. i am so buying their new cd when it comes out! all my buds luv their music, so keep the Blink spirit alive!
B00003CX6P|5.0|Patricia Highsmith's classic novel has been filmed once before as &quot;Plein Soleil&quot; but this has to be the definitive version.  It engages the viewer from the opening seconds as Matt Damon's title character impersonates a friend with an injured hand to the closing seconds when he...well you'd better see for yourself; I don't want to give away the plot like the otherwise excellent documentary on this DVD does.<br />The colours are warm and vibrant and beautifully evoke post war Italy, although it is more &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; than &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;.  The film is populated by beautiful people into which the talented Mr. Ripley appears and tries to join but when that proves to be out of his reach his actions take a darker turn. The style of direction is observational and a viewer may need to see the film more than once to get all the nuances in the plot; but there are few better reasons to buy a DVD than for repeated viewings.<br />I particularly liked the attention to detail especially the red glasses they drink out of while on the yacht; my parents bought  identical ones when they went on holiday in Italy in the early 1960's and I still have two of them.  But this attention is not fussy as in Merchant/Ivory productions and draws the viewer in to the film rather than distracts from it.<br />All the perfomances are superb but special credit is due to Jack Davenport as Peter; quite a change from the homophobic Miles he plaved in television's &quot;This Life&quot;.<br />This is a great film in a feature packed DVD that belongs in any serious film lovers collection.
B000002VMH|5.0|When I first bought this album, I have to admit that I hated it and even tried to take it back to the store. But, I decided to listen to it again. After a few times, I absolutely LOVED it. I am usually not one that looks deep into music to get an interpretation of anything, but 'Diva' allowed me to do that with ease. Even if you don't care about the &quot;deeper&quot; meaning of songs, I URGE you to buy this album just to hear Annie's haunting, soulful, and rich voice. A far as I am concerned, she has the most beautiful voice of all time. Another wonderful fact about this album is that Annie wrote all of the songs herself. All of her songs are a testament to her brilliance. BUY THIS ALBUM! You will be very glad you did.
B00004T9VY|5.0|The first music that stirred my adolescent soul. Haunting, Beautiful- A masterpiece! Listening to it now reminds me of how much Cat Stevens meant to me, and to millions of others. Essential!!
B00001NFCY|5.0|this is my favorite cd by far! i think that every song on it is written very well and it really potrays the thoughts well. my favorite song on it is never die or what if, so if u havent heard those songs go listen to them they are wonderful! well thats about it, so go buy this cd!!!!
6301971558|5.0|If Clark Gable had not been a star before Mogambo, he would have been afterward.  This is the kind of stuff that creates action heroes.  You name it, it's got it ... adventure, romance, and intrigue.  Sadly, it's the kind of picture which could never get made today.  The characters in this story are the real thing ... the plot doesn't have to develop their personalities.  It's a bigger-than-life scenario with ole big ears as the great white hunter, and the future Princess as the impressionable wife of an anthropologist.  The only twist is that before the dashing couple arrives, another flame ignities our hero's fire.  When they throw the whole gang into an ill-timed safari, all you-know-what breaks loose.  The action doesn't interfere with the plot, and vice versa.  Just about the time you think it might becoming a love story, it's action time.  The movie keeps you interested from the first shot to the happy ending.  What would you expect from a Gable and Grace movie?
B00000IQCF|5.0|This movie has one of the most astounding openings, grabs your attention and keeps it from when the main character is born.      I have been watching more foreign films for something a little different. This is from Madrid, Spain with nice yellow subtitles. I didn't have any trouble following the story, even if you don't read every word. It also has some beautiful Spanish music.      After being sent to prison because of a woman, Victor decides to become the greatest lover in the world. There are many plot twists which I would not want to spoil for you. The actors and actresses are great, makes it all believable. It is such a twisted tale of 2 policement and 1 Victor. It also deals with abuse. I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it and many times afterwards. &quot;We are two teardrops in a song!&quot;
0671027344|5.0|The cool part about this book is that it is easy to read, yet it isn't a book with no depth.  When I read this book, I found myself relating to Charlie.  I don't want to give the suprise away so I'll end with saying that this is a good book you should read.
B000003ER4|5.0|As another reviewer notes, this 1975 RCA recording, with deluxe cast under Leinsdorf is lush. (The Amazon listing seems to start the cast off alphabetically, so the reader may not guess that it stars Neblett, Kollo, Prey and Luxon.) As such, it draws Die tote Stadt nearer to &quot;big&quot; Strauss operas (Die Frau ohne Schatten, Danae, Helena...) than to early Schoenberg or Zemlinsky. The world premiere recording, it is something of a monument, a reference recording, and deserves 5 stars. However, another recording exists, a live Naxos set from the Swedish Royal opera, less lush but perhaps more dramatic, that those fond of the harmonies and orchestration of the Gurrelieder or Zemlinsky will appreciate. As will those on a tight budget - the Naxos set is almost half the price of the RCA/Leinsdorf box.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Britney sounds the same on every song. The fact that all the songs sound alike doesn't help either. This cd is only meant for people who like different words to the same Oops music with the tiniest tweek in it.
0060976624|5.0|......they will disappoint you after this gem.  This is not only a fabulous mystery, it is sinister and hilarious.  I've read all the Chris Buckley I can find, but none match up to this masterpiece.  As I read it, I marvelled that I could not tell if the author was sympathetic to the soulless characters.  Buy two books, because you'll finish this one quickly.
B000002LEE|4.0|Jane's Addiction's energy, as displayed in their live album which preceded this one, is best captured live. This album is hard and melodic at once... the songs are inspired and truly a revelation... as though you can see the pages of one musical era to the next changing. But this album is not quite the same caliber as its predecessor (the live album). It is endowed with brilliant songs (&quot;Ocean Size&quot;, &quot;Mountain Song&quot;, and the classic &quot;Jane Says&quot;), and overall is an ambitious and overreaching effort of continuity which showcases great talent. The essence of Jane's Addiction, though, is to be found on the live album.
6300274195|5.0|Despite all its merits, the fine plot, cute characters and beautiful animation, Dumbo has always been regarded as the quintessential &quot;baby movie&quot;. Kids start regecting it at around the age of seven, saying &quot;I'm too old for THAT.&quot; But the very beauty of the film is its enduring quality. The way you can come back to it after so many years and realize, hey, this is good stuff. It's a nice secure movie, with none of the scary undertones that colored its predecessors Pinnochio and Snow White. The songs, including &quot;Baby Mine&quot; and &quot;When I See an Elephant Fly&quot; are just timeless. It is eloquent, innocent,and truly a masterpice. Everyone, from the most insecure child, to the boldest adult can gain somthing from this sweet little film. It is classic, untarnished Disney.
B00003CX5A|1.0|Terrible. Just terrible. Screenwriters must take some liberties in adaptations, but Irving's story was raped. Not only was the storyline impossible to follow, the special effects (which I assume were added in such abundance to try and blanket the terrible plot) did nothing to add to the film. <br />The excessive gore was simply distracting and gratuitous. It's as if the goal was to put as many disturbing scenes as possible into the hour-and-a-half flick. Burton is okay in that mild gothic humor he likes to do, but this quasi-serious attempt fell flat. If excessive gore and gray skies can keep your attention for any length of time, you may enjoy this. Otherwise, do not waste time or money on this film. <br />Really. It's that bad. Really.
B00004XONN|1.0|Sorry to say .. but this album is terrible.  I bought it as it was released, since I awaited it as eagerly as any other fan did.  And I am hugely disappointed.  Radiohead is capable of greatness, and this is not it.  Over-whelmed by expectations after OK Computer, I suspect that Radiohead became scared and copped out, pointedly trying to evade failure by doing something so very different .. and worthless.  So now everyone can boldly claim: &quot;Hey, it's not Ok Computer, what did you expect?&quot;<br />The reviewers here claiming it is one of the best albums ever, and that 5 stars aren't enough .. are deceiving themselves.  I can not find any redeeming thing in this album to like and will get rid of it as soon as a shop opens on Monday morning that buys used CDs.  I did allow myself a few days to try and see if it will settle in, but I don't want this crud in my collection.  I feel embarrassed at having been conned out of my money for this trash.  It even pains me to give it a single star.
B00003W8NM|2.0|A preacher once prayed, \\"Lord, please give me a good sermon to go with this joke.\\" Likewise, I can imagine Fight Club's writer praying for a good movie to go with his plot twist. But if this was his prayer, it went unanswered. <br />Meet \\"The Narrator,\\" played masterfully by Ed Norton, who is a deeply troubled young man working for a major auto manufacturer assessing whether recalls on defective auto parts will exceed the cost of all the lawsuits that could result. The Narrator initially has two problems, an insatiable materialism and insomnia, the latter of which he eases by going to various self-help groups for afflictions he doesn't actually have, ranging from testicular cancer to brain parasites. Once he allows himself to cry at a meeting, he can finally sleep again. But trouble rises further when The Narrator meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), another fraud in the support group racket. The Narrator is unable to focus at the groups in her presence, being reminded of his own lie. Marla, looking like a rejected kewpie doll, agrees to attend on different nights so as not to disturb him. The tone of sexual confusion is obvious even this far into the movie, from characters such as Bob (Meat Loaf Aday), who has lost his testicles and since developed breasts. If it sounds like I'm describing a new Woody Allen movie, just read on.<br />Enter soap salesman Tyler Durden, portrayed by a rougher tougher Brad Pitt doing his 12-Monkeys schtick. The two meet on an airplane and it becomes immediately apparent what is brewing: Tyler is everything The Narrator isn't. He's rugged, handsome, and very bold with his words, spouting off the post-modernist nihilism that this movie aspires to. After a very brief and witty exchange, Tyler leaves The Narrator with only a business card.<br />It's not long before these two friends are reunited. The Narrator returns to his apartment to find that it has exploded in his absence, and homeless, he calls Tyler and they go out for a beer.Their night out ends in the parking lot with Tyler telling The Narrator, \\"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\\" And thus is born the Fight Club. It begins with only The Narrator and Tyler, but quickly it expands to include hundreds of men in many franchises across the country. Their motive? Simple: To beat the piss out of each other in order to experience a realness they can't get anywhere else. Apparently it's only in pain that we are truly aware of ourselves. <br />Things quickly turn south, however. Tyler starts a lecherous relationship with Marla, troubling The Narrator deeply. And then the Fight Club itself gets skewed when the men who were once only adrenaline-filled over-grown boys fighting it out turn militant, joining Tyler's ultra-secret \\"Project Mayhem\\" team. They all live in Tyler's dilapidated house and perform various assignments from destroying corporate art and franchise coffee bars, to urinating in restaurant-goer's soup and inserting porn clips into children's movies at the theatre, with Tyler continuously spewing his anti-capitalistic philosophy all over the audience's lap. The members of Project Mayhem feel as though they are at last real individuals, although they are engaging in mindless cult-like activities. <br />Circumstances begin to spin out of control, and just when you think the plot couldn't be any more derailed, enter The Gratuitous Plot Twist, that staple of recent flicks, to shock (trick) the audience into thinking this is a deep and enigmatic movie.     <br />Deep? Enigmatic? I'm not buying it, friends. What director David Fincher (Seven, The Game) and writer Chuck Palahnuik have created is in my opinion art for the sake of being artistic. While some critics would hail this as genius, don't be taken in. It is much more difficult to write a real story with real characters. It is much more difficult to tell a story that is supposed to be believable rather than one that is almost entirely symbolic. Films such as Fight Club take theeasy way out by exploring surreal themes - if it's uncharted and undefined, then how can they do it wrong? They can rest assured that it will appeal to at least one underground coterie. The real challenge would have been for Fincher and Palahnuik to delve into the topics of masculinity and nihilism from a more traditional story format. If an avant-garde movie such as Fight Club is to be given credence, it needs to be superbly beyond superb.<br />And, alas, Fight Club, while containing some good one-liners and excellent acting, never gets off the ground despite taking a giant leap. The average movie-goer will wonder what this film is supposed to be. A commentary on manhood? Mr. Mom did a better job. Is it a comedy as Palahnuik himself suggests? I'm not laughing. Is it a moral critique? I hope not - \\"capitalism is bad, but urinating in soup and putting porn in Cinderella is good,\\"?<br />I don't want to take everything away from the film - there were certainly some clever aspects. For one, Tyler's home-made soap is fashioned from human fat, which he sells to high-end department stores. What we have then is people reveling (washing) in their own refuse (fat), Tyler's main message throughout the movie. And the acting is not to be questioned, but would we expect otherwise from Norton and Pitt? <br />Unfortunately, though, Fight Club seems to fall on the very grounds on which it tries to stand - what it attempts to say is undermined by what it actually is. It is nothing more than a product of the very attitudes it aspires to spurn in the film. Overdone visual effects, gratuitous violence, unabashed sex scenes - does this sound like the movie of a true reformer or a good ol' boy looking for fun on a Saturday night? It's very hard to take the movie's message seriously, especially when it makes the trendy accusation against materialistic values, but only offers fascist ideals in their stead. I don't think Fight Club is going to produce any proselytes to its counterfeit grown-up suggestions, since one would almost have to already be a cemented nihilist to sit through it. But it should be enough to trick a few intellectuals into thinking that they alone bear the burden of \\"getting it.\\" I fear Fight Club is destined to become nothing more than a scar on Fincher's otherwise excellent resume.
B000006TRV|1.0|From the moment i heard the horrible song &quot;Mother&quot; i didn't want to hear any more of this band.But,unfortunatly my friend was listening to this cd and as i thought,this cd was really bad.I don't really know why people like Pink Floyd.All of the songs are slow,boring,and i couldn't find the &quot;message&quot; that people say it has.After my listening experience of a half hour of PinkFloyd i don't want to hear it again.
B00004XONN|2.0|I'm very disturbed by this album. I'm even more disturbed at the embrace it's received by its listeners. Did I get the same album in the mail as they did?<br />Radiohead is and for most of their career has been a cutting-edge band. They have always managed to do something completely different than what is \\"out there,\\" and yet produce masterpieces of real music.<br />This is not real music. In fact, there is not one coherent song on this CD. It's a cacophony: a lifeless, experimental collection of unrelated noises. You will hear very few discernible melodies. It's the Fight Club of music - art for the sake of art.<br />Radiohead went too far, in my opinion. As in the past, they succeeded in doing what nobody else is doing in music, but this time they produced an unlistenable product in the process. <br />I wish could say that I'm one of those few who alone bear the burden of \\"getting it\\" but I can't. Every song sounds like a three-minute introduction to some other song, and just when you think you're going to hear an actual beat, they mix it up and throw in another off-beat to confuse you. <br />They use every digital trick in existence in a desperate effort to give us something we've never heard before. On previous albums, they managed to give us what we'd never heard before in the form of good music. On Kid A they accomplish this task by giving us noise - noise that nobody else *would* put on an album.<br />I'd like to complain about the length of the album, but the short running time of under 50 minutes may have been an act of mercy by the producer. I truly hope Radiohead will come back to what makes them great - haunting melodies (which are present albeit scarce on Kid A) and great music, combined with cutting-edge production. <br />Maybe they misunderstood what people love about them, or maybe they didn't care. While this is laudable, it doesn't bring back my thirteen bucks.<br />I know I'm in the minority of reviewers here, but probably not in the minority of the countless others who don't take the time to write reviews for mediocre products. I would ask that you don't give me an \\"unhelpful\\" vote simply because you disagree with me. An unhelpful review is one that tells you nothing, not one you disagree with.
B00004XONN|5.0|Let me just put it out there.... this album is amazing, that's really all that needs to be said.
B00004XONN|1.0|Bottom line: This is an experimental album with no actual &quot;songs&quot; in the traditional sense. There are very few melodies (when there are even vocals), mostly just out-of-key muttering. The &quot;horn-section&quot; of which people are writing is maybe 20 brass/woodwind instruments droning in different keys and time-signatures for about three minutes. So why do people like it? My guess is below.<br />The reviews must be very confusing to someone who has not heard this album. For the most part it is either a five star rating or a one star - &quot;Unbelievable!&quot; or &quot;The Worst Album Ever.&quot; <br />I think this is easily sorted out. On several of the positive reviews you will read things like, &quot;I've always been a Radiohead fan - forever. I still don't know what to think of Kid A, but I gave it five stars anyway...&quot; Translation: &quot;Having always been a Radiohead fan, I'm too embarrassed/scared to go along with my common sense and agree that this album is absolute drivel.&quot;<br />You might also read, &quot;It's not like anything else out there!&quot; Granted. But that doesn't make it good or even listenable. 49 minutes of a cat screeching is unlike anything out there, but I wouldn't pay 13 bucks for it (again). <br />Lastly, you will read, &quot;If you jumped on the bandwagon with Ok Computer, don't even go near this one...&quot; Translation: &quot;You just wouldn't 'get it' like us real fans would. We're alternative, nobody understands us, etc., etc., etc. We haven't even taken the trouble or the time to decide if we actually like it, we just assumed we would and gave it five stars. Meanwhile, we'll just smile condescendingly and wink at each other as we watch the neophytes struggle with it.&quot;<br />Let's be honest - if an unknown band released this album you would think it was a joke -literally, a joke. But Radiohead does it and it's considered genius. It's one of those albums.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|The first CD was OK... not the best... but I think they've really grown up since making their first CD. This one's really heartfelt. Even so, I wouldn't reccomend listening to your best friend play &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; for hours on end... it gets boring after approx. 5 hours... and I'm being serious, too.<br />*paganhappyhugs* ~Margarethe n'ha Lia
0345350499|5.0|As you can see by all the reviews, this book has impressed a great many people!<br />This book explores the King Arthur story from a woman's point of view, specifically that of his half-sister Morgaine (AKA Morgan Le Fay). Each character is richly developed. There are the great, the wonderful, the evil, the tragic, the doomed characters ...<br />This book is full of magic and wonder. Fantasy lovers, if you are looking for dragons, look elsewear.  There is mention of one mythical dragon being slayed by one of the heroes of the story, but it is mentioned after the fact, which was just fine for me.<br /><br />This book has just the right blend of magic and wonder, without the incredible -- dragons, faeries and the like.  There is an alternate place, called Avalon, which can only be visited with the help of magic.  It is veiled from the world, but still looks much like the real world. Though such a place could qualify for some as incredible, could never really be, Ms. Bradley wrote about it so well, that you don't think it's so incredible after all, that such a place could really exist.<br />When you finish this book, you could almost believe that it is all true, you could almost believe that all of it could have really happned. You don't have that, wow, what a great fantasy, but that could never really happen feeling.<br />This was the first fantasy book I ever read and now I'm hooked! I have a keeper copy on my shelf and know that I'll be reading it again and again in the future.  Once you get your hands on a copy, you won't part with it either!
6302814359|4.0|It's nice to have a serious zombie film(which usually doesn't happen with most of the past efforts 'cause they are too extreme and tend to become funny), but it's fun to take a break from that a watch something like RTLD 2. It doesn't live up to the first -it's a hoot, though. Why anyone would not like this movie, I don't know.Too bad we don't see Linnea Quigley jumping around nekkid in this one. Check it out !
0553106635|5.0|The cliche would be to say that words can't express how great this book is, but that, of course, is false.  For words DO express how great it is - George R. R. Martin's words, though, not mine.<br />A Storm of Swords is the third, and the best (so far), of the Epic Fantasy series A Song of Ice anf Fire.  In a time when half the world is writing Epic Fantasy, George R. R. Martin is the only one who is doing it as it should be done.<br />A Storm of Swords' pace is like that of a snowball, it start small and slow, and accelerates.  The book's beginning is a masterful art of wieving threads together, and about a third way into is you start to shadder because you're in the most incredible rollar costar imaginable, and it won't let you off until the very ending, and you'll be left suffering until a Dance with Dragons will be out in 2002 - but that's true for all of us Martin fans.<br />A Storm of Swords shows Martin's loathing of happy endings and black/white characters - Martin's world is so realistic it hurts.  The morality gets much more complicated, as we get indights into a character we thought was a villain, and see his actions completely differently.<br />The twists are very logical, but completely surprising.  For each development predicted by the fans, three weren't.  Some questions are answered, but more are asked, and through the entire story, the Stark words can be heard: &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;<br />After A Clash of Kings, I thought Martin wrote a story that was practically impossible to top.  But he has, and now all I can do is to count the days until A DANCE WITH DRAGONS
0780631684|1.0|Final Destination goes nowhere but down.  The acting is horrible, except for Ali Larter, although that doesn't save this movie from catastrophe.  Like most teen-slasher movies, the plot is VERY predictable, although half the deaths in this movie are literally impossible.(Computer screens don't explode!  Busses don't go fast enough while turning a corner, to kill someone!  Neon signs can't turn sideways!  The scene with the eletrical wire defied every law of Physics.  You catch my drift...)  Honestly, this movie is not worth seeing, and if you want to see a good scary movie, the Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs, and even the Blair Witch Project are more satisfying than this!  Steer clear, watching this movie is worse than being subject to any of the deaths in this movie, 100 times.
B00001IVOR|3.0|the visuals are most certainly there. the actual rhyming is also. infact, the rhyming, technically is much better than Enter. I guess it's just music. too bad. it can be enjoyable, but it isn't good at all. if you are a fan, i guess you should get it, but it doesn't matter either way.  if you aren't a fan, don't bother.
B0000039LE|5.0|Recently I was at a the movies when a preview came up starting with &quot;The scariest movie of all time....&quot; and I was trying to guess what is was, and I said &quot;Halloween?&quot; instantly. Of course as you might know that movie ended up being The Exocist, another great movie, but I think Halloween is by far the greatest horror film ever.  It has all the elements and then some more that are quite original; what I really like about Halloween and all the Halloween series is the concpet of pure evil.  Michael has no reason for being the way he is; there is no tortured child sceanario.  Just pure evil; that in itself is a frightening concept, and in this movie it is brought to the screen ingeniously. I think the addition of the plain white mask has such a great effect; it's almost an example of what is inside Michael's soul; nothing. The mask to me has a really, really creepy affect. Then of course, as no one reviewing this movie can leave out, there is the music. The theme song for this movie is PRICELESS. Have you ever heard a more ingenious score for a scary movie? It's literaltey fear in audio form.  You have the fast paced melody in the forfront, that almost could stop like the beating of your heart and your pulse racing when you are afraid. Then you have the low, slow notes in the back, that just totally illustrate the psycho coming slowly to get you and the impending doom to come. And then on top of all this, you have this fast clock sound in the background, just making you think of how much time you have until it's over. The song is just unbelievable genious.  I have to say that one of my favorite scenes in this movie is when Jaime Lee Curtis sees Michael through her window and between her drying sheets. *shiver*, it is so creepy. And this movie pulls it off so well without having a massive amount of blood and gore. It really gets to the root of human fear &amp; evil. Nothing beats it.
B000000OUJ|5.0|one of the reasons I love rap is for the visuals that some rhymes put in my mind.. more rappers can't than can give me good visuals.. GZA is one of the best at doing that for me and he is just a great rapper.  It's dark and scary sounding while at the same time pure hip hop. And everybody who guested on the album gives great visuals as well.  This album has such an incredible vibe to it.. Plus, RZA did some of his best work on this album. the beats go with the rapping perfectly. if you like Wu-Tang clan, you need to get this/
6302787564|4.0|falling down's script and direction are both laking, but i loved it anyway. to me its a story of what would happen if i had no self control. i recomed it to anyone who wants to break out and kick some booty.

0767830520|5.0|this movie is directed and acted so well that the first time i saw it i was supprized that it did'nt win more oscars. i watched this movie with another guy and two girls, the guys both liked it but the girls did not. the movie deals with many controversial subjects like prostution and violence. it is amazing and i recomed it to anyone and everyone.
B000002WPI|5.0|this is just one of the best rap albums EVER and if you claim you like rap, you need to have this and that really is that.  I still carry it around with me, and I think I always will. <br />This is one of the few rap albums that every rap fan is supposed to have. So get with it!
B000002KCI|5.0|Cortez was the first song I heard of Neil Young. I was blown away. I got the next day. Although there are many other good songs on this album, like Stupid Girl and Drive Back Cortez eclipses them all. Get this song.
B00004XQP4|1.0|OK Anybody remember the days when Green Day was a punk band?  Well now they do country dance music.
B000001E8S|5.0|Pop, okay, Zooropa, pretty good, Passengers, masterpiece. I don't know much about Eno besides what he has done with u2 but this has to the greatest u2 album. this album is so fresh, it has the feeling of a first album. I don't think I could pick a favorite song between 2,3,4,5 and 6 they are all great songs.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I MYSELF HAVE BEEN AN AVID COMIC BOOK COLLECTOR SINCE 1961. SO TO SAY I HAVE A LOT OF PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE X-MEN COMIC WOULD BE PUTTING IT MILDLY! AS FOR THE MOVIE IS WAS MARVELOUSLY WRITTEN AND THE ACTING WAS SUPER AWESOME! IT FOLLOWED THE BOOK AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CONSIDERING THE DEPTH IT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED CONSIDERING THE LONGEVITY OF THE BOOK! THE X-MEN ALONG WITH MANY OTHER MARVEL BOOKS JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME. YOU HAVE PROVEN TO THE MOVIE INDUSTRY WHAT QUALITY REALLY MEANS IN YOUR MOVIE! ME AND A FRIEND WENT TWO SEPARATE TIMES TO SEE IT AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED AND WAS GLUED TO THE SCREEN LIKE KIDS AGAIN! THANK YOU FOR BRINGING EXCITEMENT BACK TO THE BIG SCREEN!
B00003CX59|5.0|This film was an absolute fantastic success story for Tim Burton.  It's a wonderful mix of horror, drama, suspense, and romance (a little bit, but NOT a click-flick.)  It is majorly differnt from the original Washinton Irving legend, but I think for comming up with a brand new story line, they did a fantastic job.  The first time i watched it, I really enjoyed it for all the spooky action and dramatic storylines, but the more I watched it, the more I really began to understand the in-depth story line and I began to enjoy it more and more.  So if you're one of those people that are bad at following a story line, you can still really enjoy the movie and take it for what it's worth. To sum it up...it's an awesome movie and a fantastic legacy.  Dont listen to those &quot;I watched the first 20 minutes and hated it&quot; sob-stories.  You really got to watch the whole thing (the ending parts are fantastic.) So click &quot;add-to-cart&quot; and enjoy!!
B00004XONN|5.0|Many have said this continues radiohead's evolution.  But you can't really know.  The next album may have more of those wild but rare guitar riffs on the previous two albums.  Anyways, for me, this album is like all of their other ones.  The first time through i was thinking, &quot;pretty good, but a little odd.&quot;  The second time, &quot;now it the odd makes sense, and fits.&quot;  The third time, &quot;this is totally badass.&quot;  I ordered it before release, and ever since i got it delivered its been in my cd player.  If i hasd to pick a favorite song, it would probably be the national anthem.  Maybe because it has a that OK computer dark sound that i love.  maybe because i play trombone.  But don't get me wrong, i like all the tunes on Kid A just as much.<br />All in all, its as good as the bends and ok computer, but even less rock n' roll.  For huge rock fans like me, that takes a little getting used to.  Only thing bad is that i may have to wait another 3 or so years for another album this good.
0684853523|5.0|...and the truth is, there's no big secret to the work of writing.  Stephen King's autobiographical handbook on the craft is both entertaining and informative, especially to those of us who aspire to be novelists.  I'm probably one of the very few people on the planet who until yesterday had *never* read a Stephen King book, and I polished this one off in a single day.  Now I might have to go back and read some of his fiction just to see his writing patterns in action.  King's familiar tone here sounds a lot like a column his buddy Dave Barry would write, and why shouldn't it?  He can even talk about the 1999 car accident in a reflective manner.<br />The most helpful tips about writing and editing I picked up from this book are: (a) avoid using adverbs at all costs, and (b) let a finished book manuscript sit in a drawer for 6 weeks before going back to edit it.  I'll keep both ideas in mind as I finish writing my own novel.  Thanks for the guidance, Stephen.  If you'll notice, I used only two adverbs in this review -- &quot;especially&quot; and &quot;probably.&quot;  I believe they're necessary; if you feel otherwise, could you let me know?  :-)
0780631684|4.0|Final Destination is an amazing curiosity-- a Teenage Death Movie with an original premise, intelligent characters, and honest-to-goodness respect for its audience.  It's like a slasher movie without the slasher, where literally anything can be lethal and the only limit is the writers' imaginations; that alone would be enough to set it apart from the rest of the '90s horror movies, but there's so much more to like about this movie because it's so well thought out and executed.  The plane crash at the beginning is one of the most believable disaster sequences ever caught on film, at least on the same level as the crash in Alive, and the rest of the movie holds up extremely well.  Surprisingly well-written dialogue on the nature of fate and mortality combines with meticulously arranged domino-effect deaths; despite the annoyingly perfect-looking teen leads, this is as far away from I Still Know What You Did The Summer Before Last and all those movies as you can get.  Still, Final Destination isn't perfect.  The funeral scene after the plane crash drags on too long, the explanations of death and &quot;the design&quot; are a bit shaky, the  FBI agents contribute nothing at all to the movie, and the ending leaves a bit to be desired (there is a more serious alternate ending on the DVD, though it still wouldn't have closed the film very well).  But if you like well-made, scary, exciting movies, FD is well worth the money.  In my opinion, it's the best horror movie of the year so far, and a must-see for any scary movie fan.
B000002IST|5.0|This CD was one of the first CD's I bought, I think I was about 12, and it really was very inspirational to me at such a young age.  Going back and listening to this album brings back classic memories, it's smooth feel is still present.  I really enjoy listening to it every now and then, it's still definitely a great emotional album.
0790733226|5.0|I saw this film in the theater back to back with Men In Black (what a contrast!).  I found Contact to have multiple levels of philosophy mixed in with the wonderful special effects.  The balance is excellent.  You can &quot;take it at face value&quot; or dig deeper into the meaning of Jodi Foster's journey.  Jodi is a fantastic actor, very convincing in her portrayal of steadfast belief in science before and her internal struggle after her trip.  The supporting cast was excellent.  <br />Was it all a hoax or was it real??  If you let it, it will spark some introspection!
B00003CXFG|3.0|The characters in this movie, especially Vin Diesel (Boiler Room, Shout), set the stage for a great story.  The character developement and interactions are very realistic, adding a little bit of credibility to an otherwise cheesy plot.  Following the characters as they unravel the rogue planet's mystery adds much needed suspense that is often missed by other similar genre movies (i.e. Supernova, Mission To Mars(uggh)). Past the 30-45 minute mark into the movie it's all climax.  The character developement comes to an screeching halt as the action sequences start.  These very dynamic characters start to take on the stereotypical roles as the movie starts to wrap up.  The ending does somewhat redeem the latter part of the movie by throwing in one last character twist, but in my opinion it is too little too late.  The main reason I recommend this movie to everyone is Vin Diesel who plays an escaped convict with exceptional(and very convenient) abilities named Riddick.  His character is very well developed and extremely dynamic.  His role alone makes me beg for more.  Any good chef will tell you that if you serve food in small portions and the person is still hungry when they are done their mouths will water.  That is exactly what Twohy does with Pitch Black.  I'm going to add this movie to my collection, but unless your the kind of guy who watches Starship Troopers at least once a week, I'd probably recommend this as a rental.  I personally hope to see Vin Diesel in a sequel that goes into more detail of this very elaborate life and universe Riddick is a part of.  Final summary, great background and characters, poor story and follow through.
