B0056BJAL8|5|I recently joined the Red Hatters Ladies group here in Yuma, Arizona and I needed a red hat as that is a requirement.  I do not look good in hats, so I thought this beret would be perfect as I can wear it on the side of my head.  This I do and it looks just great.  Have gotten a lot of compliments on it and I am very pleased with my purchase.
B004ARNUBU|5|These were great. Based on the reviews, I thought they might be a little big, but she can still wear them now and has some room to grow. I bought the small size for my 2 year old and they are great so far.
B000PHOGSA|4|He's says they work... that's about all the review I can muster from him. They wash well and so far the seems are holding up.
B009YQ5QGO|1|For years these were incredible thigh-highs.  I had some pairs that lasted so long the silicon gave out or the heels wore through before the stockings developed a run. But something's changed in the manufacturing process and these are now completely worthless. I've had a couple that have started running before I've gotten them on past the knee. I've actually stopped purchasing them (and frankly, anything else by Hanes) because when comparing cost-to-quality, it's literally insulting that Hanes would charge more than $0.50 (yes, fifty cents) a pair for this garbage.
B00G04UWL2|4|Really fits the bill---fold!!!
B004CO8ETE|5|My son is 11 years old and has a kidney disease which over the 8 1/2 yrs has caused swelling in the abdomen area as well as weight gain from steroids. I have not been able to find these particular style of underwear for a long time. I am so glad to have found them on Amazon and glad this company still had some in stock. Now my son can be comfortable! Thank you!!
B007Q290EW|1|It had zero for padding. If you want your laptop to have a little bit of padding don't get this. If you want no padding what so ever get it and you will be happy.
B008EYDBAK|3|The clasp doesn't hold closed.
B00UW07QGO|3|Quality as expected besides size
B00S5B97XC|4|I really love this shirt ... the color is great. I'm glad I read the reviews because it does fit small, I ordered a size bigger.  It came very fast, which was great!
B004D6BVKA|5|Ok... i love it. it fit on me very good, please check the measures before purchase, be an intelligent customer, don't be and, you know.<br /><br />Ok about the product, it works very very good, will make you sweat a loooot. I can definitely say that it helped me with my cellulite. BUT i am using 4 different things. 1. I reduced the carbohydrates in my meals almost at all 2. i work out, i run 2-3 miles (run/walk fast with my capris) and do yoga. 3. I took 3 pills per day of something to help to drain the water of your body and help with the cellulite 4. I use a cream (sold by amazon) it came in 2 bottles 1 for the morning 1 for the night, and i do some massage in my legs.<br /><br />i definitely wont say that any of it is miracle but it worked for me, i ran for months and my cellulite did ran from me. The change in my meals helped a lot to lose cellulite before start with the capri the pills and the creams. BUT the most important is do some exercise. them, move your pretty a... and go run for what you want.<br /><br />sorry if my grammar is a little weird.
B006NZPZ8I|5|These metal collar stays are perfect! I was so sick of losing or bending those cheap plastic stays that come with most my shirts. Every grown man should invest in metal collar stays, no excuses.
B000BPRUHK|5|These sox fit perfectly, feel great and prevent leg and feet swelling and fatigue during travel!  They look great, too!
B00JMBE82Y|5|good
B002YMN1A8|5|MI SOBRINA QUEDO FASCINADA Y SUS AMIGAS IGUAL UN EXITO TOTAL LA GORRA, EL TIEMPO DE ENTREGA FUE RAPIDO .
B0002XSVLA|5|love the roc pants
B00N503M7A|4|Bought them for granddaughter who struggles with eczema and she says they are very comfortable.<br />She is 7 years old, average size and these fit very well.
B007XSXYX2|5|I read reviews that this product was too big and too long, but it was perfect in both of those areas to me. It's not too shiny either, which was a concern, and the pockets are very deep.
B0016OO4RE|5|I had a crazy hat theme party and this was perfect.  Well made with vibrant colors.  Would definitely recommend for a fun time. Great price too.
B004A7YLPY|3|When I looked at the Wallet online I saw nine card slots one bill pocket and I thought there was one ID window WRONG!  The ID window is very small and none of my IDs fit.  I'm not sure what you can put in that window because it is very small.
B00HJO8K3Y|5|I am so pleased with the length of this skirt!!!!  I was shocked that it fit perfectly, the skirt was a nice length-no bottom muffins peaking out, and in the water it fit exactly the same.  The arm holes are small, but my arms aren't exactly tiny at 250lbs, 5'6&#34;, sz 22!  It feels like they will be tight, but that is not the case.  I am a large B cup, or small C, and don't come close to filling up the top, yet it fits.  Brilliantly made.  Very beautiful material, and, most shocking, when the skirt lifts up, the material underneath is the exact same!
B008BVDM64|4|Its a tad bit large on me, but I like it anyway.  Its great with a pair of jeans or leggings and a tank top underneath.
B00BIZUO8O|2|not the same quality as buying in the department stores.<br />maybe non genuine, or manufactured under licence.<br />they are ok, but dont expect anywhere near the quality of genuine Hugo boxers
B00IF3LAIA|5|I purchased this shirt for my father-in-law for Father's Day.  I thought the shirt was a very nice color and seemed to be well made enough but I did not unfold and inspect it closely.<br /><br />I sent it along to the recipient and got a glowing report.  He loved the color, the fact that it had pockets and snaps and was an overall nice shirt.
B00826JLIQ|5|Though I'm an avid Amazon shopper and have never been disappointed with their products or service, due to my hectic schedule I refrain from writing reviews. When I opened the package and saw the quality of this raincoat, I was blown away and felt compelled to give it a &#34;thumbs up&#34;. I was delighted to find that It has a soft inner lining. The colors are as vibrant as the picture, and overall the quality was A+. When my three year old grandson saw it, his face lit up, he immediately put the coat on.......and he strut around ever so proud of his Thomas the Train rain jacket. So cute that he thought the hood was so &#34;cool&#34;. I would have expected to pay much more for such an outstanding rain coat as it's protective, attractive, and made well to last. I would recommend this item to any one whose child or grandchild loves Thomas the Train.
B00HIVSMKY|5|Muy bonita
B00M8EW45U|5|Fit perfect as always!
B00KVME39G|3|Liked it more at first...top snap just broke...now to fix that.
B00816O60K|5|Great panty.  Smooth and comfortable, there are no panty lines and they don't ride up or slide down.  I am very satisfied.
B00U2BMI5W|2|The cups fit like a B not C.
B001AAV4WC|5|I Love these pants there very unique cant wait 2 get them. kimora lee simons has  good taste. 1 for kimora
B008JRTHQ4|4|I'm happy I found this on a Lightening Deal, but believe that it is a good buy at Amazon's regular price.  I jumped at the chance to order this when I noted that it was available in \\"SHORT\\" sizes.  I am 5' 5\\", 135 lbs, 40 inch chest, 31\\" waist.  Because I can at times go 150 lbs, I ordered a 42 short.  The fit is good.  If anything, I would categorize the fit as \\"generous\\".  I am certain a 40 would fit over top of a suit coat with no problem for me.<br /><br />The sleeve length is still a little long for me and there is no way to adjust the cuff.  Therefore the sleeve hangs further down my hand than I like.  I believe that the short coat is designed for guys 5' 8\\".  Still, if you are short like me, you will be happy that at least it comes close.  I would though prefer a Velcro adjustment for the cuff.  As for the rest of the design of the coat, I think it is about perfect.<br /><br />As far as warmth goes, I would say that it is good down to about 40 F.  I also purchased and reviewed this [[ASIN:B008JRTHLY London Fog Men's Chester Parka]] and like it too.
B00IWBKIUQ|5|It's cool and it fits well.  I thought it would be see through, but the white wasn't see through.
B001GG3DVA|5|Very soft good quality leather, keeps my hands very warm. Had an XL purchased and fit my larger hand and longer fingers very well thanks!
B00DYD07DU|3|Love the color; fits tight over hips.Nice weight for summer in SouCal.
B004MVKTGI|1|I just received my lovely Lace Bolero, it is really beautiful.  it is a 3X,  and I wear 1X to 2X -  this fits me like it is a standard Large.  -Please be aware that this is not proper sizing and runs very, very small.<br /><br />Thank you
B007P3SAUW|5|I love these scrubs. I have only worn them four times and have washed them twice( I bought 5 pair) and  so far they have held up
B004A6MFRG|5|I bought this tie for my boyfriend. It's exactly what I was looking for. It's a pink tie but the blue tones it down. It's his new favorite, he been wearing it to work for months now. I highly recommend it!
B006333J88|3|Even though I order M it feels a little loose
B004DBQQF0|4|Most attractive fabric--so soft to the touch even though only 15% cashmere. However, when compared with a Ralph Lauren suit of supposedly the same size I bought recently, it was 2-3 inches longer, sleeves also longer, and much broader from shoulder to shoulder. I was sad that it therefore did not fit me, and it is difficult to imagine a person of my size (I am 6'1&#34;) wearing a 44S or even (to get the shoulders closer) a 42S, which seems what might work given the problems listed with a 44R.
B00N8MAUOS|5|Love each and every one of these headbands. Perfectly made and the colors are amazing.
B004XY6RL0|4|very nice great value
B00AOJHMSU|5|I got this for my husband, and he loved this polo shirt. Fabric is very summer light (we live in a 120^ F summer season) , fit is relaxed and print is better than in the picture. I only wish they came with pocket (s) (sunglasses, pen etc etc)
B003AXW9EY|5|Very comfortable.
B009FV8N6I|5|great product for the price.
B00N9MM180|3|Came much quicker than I thought. Size says M... I would say its more like a 4/6 size once you get it. It is a big looser on me [I needed prob a small or 2/4], but there are little snaps to make it about 1&#34; tighter which is nice. I was actually hoping for the smaller fit than the 'size m' since it is in overseas sizing. The hood and the fur on the hood are both detachable. Quality is fair... you are paying for what you get and I was on a hunt for a creme puff vest with fur at a decent cost. The product isn't completely finished... I had to cut a lot of thread strings, but for the cost I do like the vest.
B0091IBDOE|4|Very happy with costume. Be sure and wear high heels, it is longer in the back. I liked the fact that it bustled in the back.
B00P59YEV2|5|Adorable!!
B004M59FXC|5|Love, love, loves this stadium reveversable rain coat. Is a perfect fit. I ordered the small petite in bronze/ black. Colors are as expected.
B008YWF8MQ|4|But very comfortable.
B0037TVRSK|5|Perfect for the 60's party
B00EOIF4MI|5|love the material and the clothes fit perfect
B00M2HQ5OO|3|The high waisted bottoms for perfect so I will definitely be pairing those with other swimsuits I have however the top seemed to be too smal for my bust.
B00FALKNP6|3|It was cute, but totally see through. I don't want to have to wear a camisole underneath it, so I returned it. It looks like it may wrinkle a lot, but that's just based on the packaging. When ironed, it might stay that way.
B00AM1MJ8I|5|The bag is exactly as described and as seen on the picture. The color is vivid.<br />I love it and hope to use it for years!
B00KJXP81Y|5|Super cute cut.  Very flattering and stylish!!
B0036RA7NY|5|As advertised and rapid delivery!
B00ONL2YGU|5|received as a sample for an honest review. realistic pattern, good stitching, sister says it's cute.
B002YC2XJS|5|great pith helmet, very easy to wear, protect very well your head from the sun.  Wearing this helmet you get a super look...
B00BGM2GMG|3|Not as nice as I thought it would be for the price, but it's cute.
B004BFIUY8|5|I love these shoes.  I'm a 6.5 and I ordered a 6.5 and they fit pretty much like a sock.  I've been wearing them around the house to break them in but even still, my feet don't hurt to do it.
B00ED7I9M2|4|Lovely
B000HTKOHI|5|love it really fit me well i'm do delighted that i just got one more my only beef is variety i need more colors -amazon/levis get to work!!!
B0084KXAGO|4|I was hesitant to buy the medium because of the reviews saying it ran big, but I did not want it skin tight and I am glad that I went with the medium.  It still hugs my curves but does look sleazy tight.  Was a good length also.
B00DBD4ZA4|2|I loved the colors of this dress but when I wore and washed it the first time all of the stitching came out of the top. I was disappointed. For the small amount I paid I didn't feel it was worth sending back. I'm going to try and use the fabric and make it into something else
B001GCUVSM|5|After reading the reviews on this bra, I took a chance and ordered it!  I've never bought a bra without an underwire before and was skeptical.  This bra is well made and gives me the support I need without sacrificing comfort!  I would love to buy another one in a different color!!  I am a large breasted woman and usually have to try on 8 - 10 bras before finding the right fit!
B008ARIS86|5|I got this as a valentines day gift. I love it it is a great hat is pretty water proof so I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00CXRLBPQ|5|I have no idea whether it works (I would have to see someone try to scan my purse) but so far the product has been easy to use, attractive and well made.  It gives me peace of mind when I am in large crowds.
B00LC0IMRA|4|It fits a bit small, but cute belt and dress!!
B007KFZFO4|5|I purchased my size 36G, it fit great. The on-wire support is very good. There is no bouncing around. I put this bra on, and forget I'm wearing it. Thus far I've ordered the bra for my sister, mom, daughter, sister in law and a friend.
B00X35QAQW|5|These are exactly like the photo! I am very happy!
B0017KWL1I|4|This is a very comfortable  hoodie. The picture is what you get.  I am not good at describing things so i say it is comfortable and soft.  If you want a superman hoodie with the classic design you can not beat this.  I am not a comic book guy just a guy who's name starts with an S, so most likely i will never wear this out.
B00E9H4HQ8|5|looks great, though word to the wise if your a size 32 or whatever, buy it a bit bigger so that its not super tight around you.duh.
B00F1C0PP2|5|It's a very comfortable jacket. Not too heavy and not too light to where it doesn't warm you up. It is a little large, but not extremely baggy or in the way of tasks. Durable and worth the purchase.
B00FYF6E38|4|Good fit
B00A8DL7PG|4|I purchased 4 shirts of different colors for my two teen boys to wear this summer.  They usually wear a MENS Large size but I went up one size when ordering because they do not like a &#34;compression&#34; fit on their shirts.  The quality seems good for the price, we will have to see how they hold up to the wear and tear of the pool and other activities.  The print on the front is small and general enough to work without being annoying.  So far we have no complaints and I would probably order the shirts again.
B004GFYOWK|3|Worked well.  Comb was not the best quality (tines were very close together with some extra plastic from manufacturer) but made it work and my daughter looked beautiful.  Needed bobby pins to stay in place
B000YAIGRU|5|I love these booties, and they have withstood my son's attempts at kicking them off (like all of his other socks).  They work well with or without socks underneath, and have kept him cozy.
B00422M6FY|5|This is a nice looking wallet, made well, Ladies if you are looking for a gift for your man and don't know what to get him, then this would make a nice gift he would like. Also it is real leather.
B00MO6F37S|5|Even more beautiful in person than I expected.  It was perfect for a Christmas party.
B002HJ3COS|3|Didn't come up quite high enough on my calf. These fit me like ankle socks, and not like the photo depicts.
B005CSNWAK|4|I'm usually somewhere between an xs and an s in most brands, but I bought the xs because I like workout pants to be tight.  These are fitted, but they are nowhere near compression. Otherwise, they are soft and comfortable and stay in place. They are a little long, but that's only because I have really short legs. They are very good for the price.
B005FQNLB4|4|Size is a tad tight across the belly but overall, very good fit and the length is just right.
B00NEEM73W|5|This wallet looks and feels expensive. I love this so muchi want a few more
B000WLXCT8|5|I ordered this for Christmas for my son.  It was everything described.  More importantly, it arrived without any issues!  This is the first time I have used online purchasing.  It made my entire Christmas easier and more enjoyable.  I will be doing this every year from now on!  I just clicked and the packages arrived.  Awesome!
B000B8UH0E|5|Well I just got my pants today on July 5 2013 an tried them on fit really nice an they have no reinforced knee pads so that was a plus for me I recommended these pants to any one I will be ordering another pair in woodland an two for black ..
B00UECBN8W|5|Very nice
B00A2POV1M|4|Versatile, warm, water resistant, lots of pockets, good zippers. Seems to have it all.  Pockets could perhaps be a little deeper but really a good winter coat.
B003TU7PQ0|5|This shirt is made of quality cotton.  The pi stencil is not cheap plastic.  It washes and wears very well.
B00ARLLLRS|3|This outfit is not that bad. I'm petite so I expected it to be a little big on me. It came un-laced which I did not like. Too time consuming and confusing if you are putting it on by yourself. The holes to lace it were too small. I got frustrated with it and it ended up crooked. It left you with a lot of extra ribbon at the bottom and no place to tuck or hide it. The buttons to snap around your neck are cheap and I was afraid of ripping it. The back part was somewhat baggy. It looked sexy but you don't feel confident in it.
B008G51XA2|5|I love this dress and it was a great fit!
B00HUGM1O0|5|Bought for my grand daughter looks cute on her.
B00192WU42|5|Great quality.  Typically purchased Jockey over the years but I'm finding they are not lasting as long as they have in the past so I thought this time around try another brand. Always loved Hanes and so far they fit and feel great.
B008KH5DVG|5|This coat was superb quality but at a reasonable price.  It looked smart and sophisticated and was well made.  My secret agent looks and feels like James Bond in it.
B0041FIC28|2|muy peque&ntilde;a pense que era ,mas grande como se ve en la imagen
B00MAVN0R2|5|The product is of very good quality
B0018OR118|2|It used to be Levi 501s could be trusted for their quality, but Levi 501s sold today vary in where they are made, in how they are cut, and in the material used. In limited sampling, it seems the ones made in Mexico are truest to the original Levi 501 cut and denim. (I'm concerned only with the medium stonewashed style here). The jeans made in Egypt and Haiti differ in the material and sometimes in the cut--the cut can be quite bad--big in the seat or high on the waist. The original Original 501s were fantastic and relatively uniform in cut with nice soft denim. Today, the Mexican-made 501s are nearly as good as the original Original but even subtle differences appear here, such as one leg being slightly longer than the other. The Egyptian and Haitian are simply not good--the material is not soft and the cut is typically off the mark. And buying over the Internet, it's a crapshoot as to which ones you'll receive. Your best bet is to buy in a brick-and-mortar store, where you can look (and try on) before buying.
B002IAM80K|5|This is a great jacket.  I wondered a bit if it would be a little flimsy with nylon fabric, but it's a substantial jacket with some heft to it.  And it looks great.  I wrote that it may run a little large, but if it does the size isn't off by much - I initially ordered a large because I have fairly long arms for my torso size, but ended up needing a medium instead.  I  think the sizing is actually done correctly and that I've just been used to imported stuff that's made too small and mis-ordered because of that.<br />This is a well made, good looking jacket with what look to be good rugged zippers.
B00CPKEHWK|5|Love wearing leggings.  These corduroy dress them up.  I wear them to the office with boots and a sweater.  Very easy to wash.
B004ABFJHO|5|I have been admiring the newsboy type caps for a long time, and searched online for hours to find what I wanted, and this cap is it.  It is not too bulky or overwhelming (I am an older lady), and quite comfortable.  I'm glad I made the purchase.  I got it through Amazon.com.
B000BTIFOI|4|Nice soft denim. Fitted. Not too long. I like it.
B00M965616|5|Excellent!
B00KG0J0NW|5|I ordered a size up and was glad I did. It fit my daughter just right. We're going to use this as a Halloween costume. She really likes the pajamas, though, so we'll probably continue to use it after Halloween.
B0027S4K1S|5|Very comfortable and obvious good quality. Other brands quickly lose elasticity, but these hold up well wash after wash.
B00ANKP2Y6|4|i like this item and its was just what i order just wish the other item was the right ones i am not sure about ordering and more jeans
B00CBAG0OM|5|I wear this after getting a spray tan. Doesn't mess up the tan.
B005M032TE|1|I've owned a few Calvin Klein v-necks in the past. I really like the fit and colors of the brand.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this sweater is complete junk. Aside from the cheap stitching that was mentioned in another review, the Merino wool actually SHRANK two sizes after one dry-cleaning. My tailor was abosolutely stumped! He measured it against another CK vneck that hadn't been dry cleaned yet. The size difference was mind-boggling. How inferior does the wool have to be to shrink?
B00XWNR0MS|5|Nice comfortable dress
B006JRZ41I|5|Very pretty and I really liked the light weight fabric. Have gotten a lot of compliments on it. I ordered a small and it fit just right, but if you like things a bit looser I would recommend that you order the next size up. It wouldn't look too big unless you are very petite. Size seems to be true to what's on the tag.
B00RY7DVMG|5|Great
B00G950FDM|4|I was a bit skeptical at first about the sizing, but the coat fit beautifully
B00EVM01JS|4|Overall nice shorts slightly big . Comfortable  and will most likely buy another pair
B00Q4ILZS8|1|Bad material
B003ZW8D2W|2|The waistband stitching started unraveling within the month.
B005GYGFZY|5|Love these! I can never find workout pants that look good on and are comfortable. perfect fit, I'm 5'6 and length is great!
B00L3HKVM6|5|Love this hoodies fits as expected!
B00BAL2DOY|5|daughter loves them, she wears them to school often and the other kids love them as well. great buy very popular
B000CD1ILK|5|Back in 1994 my mother bought me this coat.  It kept be warm and safe through many blizzards, floods and camping trips.  I continually used the coat till 2002 when my ex threw it away while I was deployed with the military.  I currently live in Hawaii, but in a few weeks will be heading up to Alaska for a mission.  I know it's going to be freezing and I know the coat that's going to keep me warm; the Carhart Arctic.
B00ST8R22Y|3|the color is not the same. dont feel so good about it.
B00GM3I4VQ|3|you get what you pay for. while it works it isnt the same as the actual loom and the patterns dont match up...cheap plastic also. BUT it does technically do what it says
B00GXKN24C|4|hat is as pictured, military green, plain, no design. i wear 7 3/4 hat size and this fits, may not fit if you are larger than that. adjustable.
B00LO60HGG|4|My hubby bought me this dress, it fits well. Love it
B00I5D6Y9K|5|Very soft and comfortable.
B00AZ7ONF6|4|I bought this as a birthday gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. She says it has tight control and enough to help you with your posture while sitting. She claims to have lost weight from having pressure on her tummy during the whole day. Also if you need more minimal wear try cutestrings.com
B000U84Y6S|5|My hubby is a big man, 6'2 and 300 lbs.. and the 3xl fit really well.. and with this material, keeps him dry.. as we know our bigger guys create a lot of heat, and this shirt is perfect for that..
B00YWHD310|5|I love it.  It's very stretchy and on me higs every bump and bulge.  Best as a layering piece.  That's what I bought it for so it works for me.
B00A6BUO72|5|I bought this costume for cosplaying Misaki Ayuzawa from Kaichou wa Maid Sama! I love how the design is accurate to the character and it came with the head band, neck piece, and everything shown in the pictures. The apron is adjustable with the strings but the vest/corset is not (it's attached to the dress). I was definitely turning heads and got my picture taken from people. Also the best thing about this was that I ordered this on the month of the convention and wanted it by the end of the month; however, it was going to take about a week or more over the convention date to get shipped to my house. The seller was incredibly kind and patient with me to try and get it to me on time. I even offered to pay more in order to get a faster method of payment, but they did it all for me for free. It came about a week before the convention day and I was extremely happy and grateful. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
B00OMHDORS|5|so far so good, is considering to buy another one!
B00LMR114E|4|I thought this was a really beautiful dress especially for the price! It's a little costumey, but not too much. I am wearing to a semi-costume/formal type of event, so it is a perfect choice for that. However, I wanted something I could use again, and this dress is definitely able to be used for other formal functions, although I couldn't say what exactly at the moment. The fit is good. For me, a little tight in the hip area, but a little large in the waist. The quality is good, and the fabric is pretty nice, although I did notice a little fraying at the top by the collar, and by the seams, but it was small and easily removable. I haven't used it yet, so I'm not sure how many uses it will stand, but it is very pretty, and I'm excited to wear it! I would definitely recommend consulting your measuring tape before purchasing, as I did this, and therefore believe I got the closest match size-wise. I would definitely order again!
B00OCAEJJ2|1|Do not but these! The suck
B005UVTRFS|4|Nice top but you need a shell underneath because there is no material on the sides. I had to war a specific shell underneath because the back is out.
B006VWJT26|4|The jacket fits relatively big for a medium, for my taste, but it seems to be of decent quality. Everything considered, I would recommend it, but I would personally buy a small next time around.
B001KFWZ34|5|As advertised.
B009GERPJA|5|I bought 3!
B00IA7T92A|3|The fabric is beautiful but the flowers around the neckline in front are falling apart after one washing.  The manufacturer should have done more than used pinking shears on the flowers.  It would have added more quality to this otherwise &#34;fancy&#34; dress.  I liked the<br />sparkly button on the back.
B0097DKRRW|5|beautiful scarf!
B00NPKG25Y|5|Very cool pants.
B00QN8M6FK|1|Terrible fit
B00L0SAJ3E|4|It's nice.  The wife got it for me.  Thought I'd throw a review up.  I'm not a usual sweater wearer. But I've worn this a few times.  It's warm, feels high quality.
B00H3VYOTM|4|thanks
B00M4MFVVA|5|My grandson loves the hat and mittens.
B00BYN0NTK|2|I had to send it back. It hit me mid calf. I am 6'0&#34;
B00EAPCMG6|5|Good shirt right fit
B00H6BVLMW|4|Idk what to say because this bra is a bit different than others that I used to wear.
B00KAISNYM|5|great item and my son is going to love it
B004PEI4F0|3|The shorts are cute but they roll at the bottom.  I expect more from the brand and the price.
B00MULOLGG|5|I lobe TB shirts and this was a great deal.
B009TB1HIA|2|Too tight. Not slouchy at all. Wish I could return it but tossed paper already. Not much else to say about it. Would be cute if it was bigger.
B0056EV608|3|I was hoping for a thicker material - but these are pretty thin.  Also, the front pockets are very shallow; as someone who actually uses their pockets, these are almost unusable.  They are about 3 1/4&#34; deep, and probably wouldn't secure most people's remote entry key fobs.  I am keeping them, but they are definitely not what I prefer.
B006KFLLMA|5|A basic bra ... nice fit, vibrant color, awesome price.  I especially like the shimmery color.  Not much more to say about this.  Bought this in a 34B and the fit is perfect.
B00IP0J7YM|4|The blouse is really pretty looks just like the picture but it runs a bit small i got a XXL based on the reviews from others and it fit a bit snug im a 38DD and it fit great from the bust area but snug from everywhere else
B000A3I3O2|5|It is the perfect denim jacket.  The length in the sleeves and the arms are just what I have been looking for and it is very comfortable.  I am just a little disappointed in the fact that they did not finish sewing up the inside pockets, so I had to do that so nothing falls out.  But other than that the jacket is just what I wanted,
B00M9KQEFE|2|I wish this ring could be resized. The website did not establish what size it was, its too small for my finger. but its cute, which sucks.
B00CBXDLHS|5|Fits very snugly and hard to wear over sweaters or suit jackets, but it is a very classy coat.  We've received several compliments on it.
B007PHKS62|4|I do like it but the shirt is a little too wide other than that, I love it. The color is pretty decent as well.
B002QCC0B2|4|my son likes it
B0028PP5QY|2|One pairi was defective.  The far corner of one front pocket was caught  in the seam river.  The pocket is unusable without cutting it loose and sewing up the hole. Otherwise great pants.  But were unlikely to buy th via Axon. Com.
B00HHOXUMW|5|Reading the reviews, there were so many controversies based on the size.  I am 5'6\\" and around 133 lbs. My size at banana republic for winter coats is a small but for this I decided to get a medium and it fits perfect! If I got a small, the sleeves would have been too short.  The hood is amazing with its enormous coverage that will definitely protect my face from rain and snow.  I got a black one and it looks nice and seems to go well with any outfit.
B00IUNDXTO|5|its shorter then the photo, but its still nice
B0058NH45I|5|Great fit
B008OQKP0M|4|Purchased this for my grandson, the Nipper. He requested a hoodie with a front emblem and no wording on the front. This hoodie is well sewn. I am very impressed by the vivid color and fabric quality of the emblem. The ribbed cuffs and waste are constructed well. The only fault it has is that it is short wasted. Fits my short Nipper but on a taller child this hoodie will ride up to high. Recommend not for the tall kid.
B000ALKJUA|5|These cami bras are wonderful.  Just enough support without being binding and not too hot in warm weather.  I will never go back to a short bra again, but I am not young enough anymore that I need to show off my attributes. I am all about comfort, but still take pride in how I look. I just wish they were less expensive so I could have more.
B005UY2DX8|5|I am very pleased with this sweatshirt.  It seems to be well made, and super cozy.  My son loves it.
B005S1NHL0|3|I rate this four stars because the material used in the design (the logo etc...) seems like it will be peeling off the t shirt after a good use or many times in the washing machine. Other than that it's fine. I like it so far. I ordered it medium and fits just as expected. Although I don't think this is worth that they are asking for... If you have the money and don't care, go ahead and buy it because it's fine.
B007XD7R3A|5|I love this little jacket. It's perfect for the occasional cool summer morning in Chicago, and I know we'll get a ton of wear out of it when fall comes. It feels really well made of a soft, thick knit and it's washed great so far with no fading. The print is absolutely adorable. It's cute without being saccharine. I would buy this as a gift in a heartbeat!
B00JGNHCPI|1|Way too small! Definitely NOT a US sizing as indicated. Costs more in postage to return to sender than it cost. Buyer beware, I guess.
B002YEYTDY|5|I think everyone searches for a good strapless bra but few have found one.  This is it! It fits true to size and doesn't fall down.  Honestly it is as good as a regular one.  I actually liked the black one so well, I bought a nude one too.<br />Thanks to others who wrote a review.  I'm not sure I would have bought this if I hadn't read them.  I strongly recommend the purchase of this strapless bra.
B005J1U9E2|5|I love my new Faux Leather leggings. Very thick but durable and VERY cool. So so happy with this purchase. I use leggings allot and I know quality when I see it.  Reasonable prized for very trendy leggings.  They go nicely with short dress and platform shoes.
B00QUDP484|5|I Love this scarf! It's so soft and really keeps the heat in when I'm walking around campus in the freezing cold weather!!
B002DCNWZ8|4|worked well for the application I needed (Santa Clause)
B00FPB6VYI|5|This was super fast shipping and was exactly like described.  Beautiful scarf...vibrant colors...thank you!
B00H26HBXO|1|The lining & stitching is all falling apart. Not worth the money.
B00DDXI32I|5|❤❤❤
B007VLS8YG|2|These are not the 559 relaxed straight jeans you remember.  They run considerably smaller and the denim weight is lighter.
B00FQTANES|5|My grandson loved it and wears it all the time.  Good Xmas gift.
B00PK8P8YK|5|Not exactly what I expected. I thought it was a little overpriced. I wish it was a little bigger.<br /><br />BUT, NOW THAT I'VE USED IT FOR A FEW WEEKS ........ I LOVE IT!
B00RDN436E|2|Runs really small - I ordered a size large b/c that's what I usually wear (even though their size chart said I would fit into a medium), and even the large is extremely tight! The seams are also very poor quality - mine came with a few small holes along some of the seams (specifically, where the fingers meet the palm of the hand) and now, after only two times wearing them those holes are pretty big. One of them is even as big as my finger nail (see picture). Now these gloves will be used for nothing more than gardening (hence the dirt in the photo)... Overall, you get the quality you pay for with these gloves. You might luck out and get a pair where the seams were very well made and the finger not stiff at all, but you're taking your chances.<br /><br />P.S. I cut the fur balls off of my pair for aesthetics (I didn't like the look of the fur), and it was very simple to do. They are only held on to the leather by two strings, so if you're thinking of doing the same it will not damage the top of the glove at all if you take the fur balls off. I cannot speak to if the fur balls are easy to break off on their own since I took mine off, but given that they are only held on by a few threads I cannot imagine that they are very sturdy.
B00CJU5TLY|4|Pretty much looks like the advertised picture...nicely detailed...i think I'm going to order Venom to complete the set  Also to the people complaining about the rubber smell...i noticed this as well.  I left a fan blowing air into it for a few days after i got it...helped get rid of that somewhat.
B00H7MNKDS|5|First an foremost, I should describe what the &#34;Dual Tone&#34; means.<br />The inside of this underwear is actually the color of the the waistband.  Since the fabric is ribbed, the inside fabric color will show through the outside as the underwear is stretched over your body.  It creates a nice blend of color that is visually appealing.<br />The fabric is soft, comfortable, and stretchy.  Allowing for plenty of flexibility to move without constriction.  The ribbed fabric design is thicker than non-ribbed; I don't see this as a negative and it actually provides a warmer option for the colder winter months.<br />The waistband is smooth, comfortable, and durable.  This waistband does not roll over.<br />The legs are not constricting, yet stay in place.  I usually experience leg ride up when cotton is the majority material in the fabric, but this blend, combined with the ribbing, works really well.  I experienced no leg ride up.<br />The pouch offers plenty of room and stretch.  It could be a little tighter for the more support on active days, but it works for this underwear and is comfortable<br />It should be noted that there is a seam running down the backside of this underwear.  I did not experience any irritation or wedgies from this seam (which cannot be said of other brands with this type of seam)<br /><br />-In Short-<br />Pros:<br />Comfortable, quality, flexible, and durable fabric<br />No (to minimal) leg ride up<br />Comfortable and durable waistband<br />Dual tone color blend is a nice change of pace<br /><br />Cons:<br />I don't see these as an issue for this underwear, but it should be noted.  Pouch could be more supportive and people may have issue with the seam down the middle of the backside.<br /><br />*Please click &#34;Yes&#34; if you found this review helpful. It would be appreciated. Thank you.
B00PG8DRKG|5|Love the skirt!  Got lots of compliments when I wore it today for tennis practice. :)
B007NIBWLI|5|the bag is constructed well.  aesthetically, it's also impressive.  inside cabin could benefit with dividers.  adjustable strap with D-rings work great.
B0086L1K4K|5|This is an unbelievable price for this quality of jeans; simply perfect.
B00L3T682Q|4|This is a little tight around the armpits for me. I bought a larger size than normal because I read the reviews about how clothes out of this area can be small.  It fit almost perfect.  It is still wearable for me and it is beautiful. This is a little shear.  Doesn't bother me if I put a dark bra underneath it is fine since it is navy blue.
B0017SMMDC|5|I love this brand. This product is my 6th from the Marena range. although its for post-surgery however I have been using it even after my surgeon told me i can stop wearing it. Its like a second skin, odorless and anti-bacterial. Even if you sweat in it, no odor is emitted. Will definitely keep on buying them.
B0018QTUSS|3|I agree with several of the posts that said these pants are cut large.  Despite the fact they are labeled &#34;regular&#34; fit they seem more akin to a &#34;relaxed&#34; fit.  They are very roomy in the waist and thighs.  In addition they are very long (and I am tall, often troubled with pants that are too short).  I was going to return them, but I decided to wash them and see if they would shrink.  They didn't.
B00495YTZE|2|I'll start by saying that I LOVE Nation LTD shirts--the fabric and fit of every shirt I've ordered has been great, and this shirt was no exception. The problem is that my shirt arrived with some very obvious fade/bleach marks across the chest and side. I did get the shirt when it was listed at a price significantly below retail, but if there's no mention of a defect in the description then I expect to get first-quality merchandise...I don't consider it a \\"deal\\" if the shirt I'm getting is damaged. For the price I paid I couldn't justify sending the shirt back, so I'm keeping it sleep in. It's a shame, because this really is a beautiful tee.
B00BZF3WRC|5|My best friend is David Miller of Fort Mc Coy Fl. Two years ago Dave had a stroke that left him Paralyzed. David is a true War Hero Combat wounded in Viet Nam . His wounds had an impact on his life and finally his body seemed to be able to take no more. Confined to a wheelchair without being able to speak write or walk, Its hard for me to find any items that might make his life easier. Dave is 100% and that lets his Wife able to take care of him and she said that the pants fit well and seem to be very comfortable to Dave. I am waiting to see if she thinks I should perhaps buy him several more pair. She knows I am low on funds myself and may not be telling me. In any case if you know any proud Marines I am sure they will appreciate this apparel.
B00I00JJV8|5|This is a beautiful summer blouse.<br />One can dress it up or down.<br />I intend to make good use of this blouse
B00T7EKWA8|5|Such an adorable looking outfit. I must say it looks a lot more expensive than what I actually paid.
B00A7TK0J0|3|They fit nice but really who puts seams at the knee line.  They rub my knees all day and hurt.
B00SIP8RPO|5|I was pleasantly surprised by this set! I wear a 4/27 in pants, and have a 34A bust. I ordered the small set and it all fit really well! Shorts are definitely looser thank expected, but still adorable - the top tightened up just fine with the adjustable straps. I received rave reviews when I wore this which just added to the value :)
B008X9ZDLG|5|sexy ;) love this thing.
B00J34RSNG|1|Item arrived damaged - - returned it.
B00DN1EBVC|4|Ordered medium, received pants with xs tags, but packages labeled medium.  To my surprise, they fit!
B00KQXOL3I|1|These cardigan does not fit like it shows in the picture, It curls under the shoulder and does not even come close to closing in the front
B002N83JXW|4|Just what I expected! Very simple and easy to put on!
B0040YZ7YG|1|Garment not wearable, would be embarrassed to wear in public. Does not look pretty in real life. Material is cheap and scratchy. Very disappointed in this seller - purchased three blouses, all 3 of which are unwearable. I purchased a blouse that looked like the photo from Syms - it is really lovely, feels wonderful.  Purchased a lovely ruffled blouse from Metrostyle.  I think that the advertising is false - do not believe that these blouses sell for $45 in a store. Amazon ought not to be selling such poor quality merchandise. Garment also arrived 2 days late. Ordered it Dec. 26, was supposed to arrive Dec. 30-Jan. 5 - arrived Jan. 7.
B00C6U4KAS|5|Awesome costume, good quality and it won us first prize as Beauty and the Beast.
B00MW8EYWS|4|This is very cute!! I'm normally a small, so I ordered a small and it seems a bit snug but it's fine and absolutely adorable.
B00IRE61Z4|5|They do run a little big but that is perfect for us as there's room to grow. Nice quality too
B00MY5UEZK|5|Great!
B0053HIWIC|5|Shipped on time and badge is what I expected.  Good quality and same exact badge you'll find at the PX.
B00ENZ63O0|1|Originally I praised this binder because I thought it was great for such a low price. However I recently found out, thanks to my sister, that this brand of binder is very bad to wear! Here is the website I was shown, http://for-transmen.tumblr.com/post/95885023260/if-youve-been-looking-to-bind-whether-youre, I didn't read through all of it but I'm pretty sure it mentions binders that are ok to wear. Please do not wear this binder, it is very bad for your health and can cause a lot of damage to your body!
B00H7W8U8S|3|I cannot get the size right in Jones New York pants - have ordered several before always have to have altered<br />too big - would be helpful if you could have corresponding sizing for corresponding brands
B00R5E21IS|5|It came earlier th at stated which is great, and the thing is huge! It could actually be a small thing blanket for a small toddler.
B002S0N0RU|5|With another Final Fantasy came comes the onslaught of themed merchandise from Square-Enix.  Remember FF8's jewelry? Well, here is one of FF XIII's first items...it's a keychain. A leather keychain emblazoned with main character Lightning's initial weapon, Blaze Edge, a Gun Blade type weapon used by only the \\"most skilled soldiers\\". In the game, Blaze Edge carries the inscription, \\"White Flash. Call upon my name\\". On this white leather key chain, you can pretend to be able to read the inscription on the metallic iconic weapon.<br /><br />The leather is high quality, not cheap stuff.  You will probably see knock offs of this just like all of the other Final Fantasy themed merchandise crafted with scrap metal and vinyl, at the upside of it costing much less. I suggest you avoid the impostors and get the real deal.  Pricey?  A bit, but Final Fantasy comes along every few years and the merchandise that goes with it is limited.  Think of it like concert memorabilia.  Overpriced, but you can't get it any other way and you will likely never get the chance again.
B00KRELIAA|4|The price is great for the quality. Wish I had ordered one size smaller
B00M24HN3Y|5|Love these socks for everyday wear - thin, comfortable, cute stripes and colors.
B000GZBFYY|4|Classic Kangol look.  Well made summer hat.  Fits just like chart says it should.  This is a flatter hat than the 509.
B00K8LZL4G|5|I really liked it. Thank you!! Great seller.
B00JKV0S66|1|It Looks nice in the picture on the website so I got it as a present for my husband for Christmas and I am EXTREMELY disappointed, it is very small, isn't shiny in the least, and looks like costume jewelry, not worth your money folks.
B00C5GN0T0|5|loved this dress
B00AKBFHBQ|4|Super soft, warm, and lightweight - gave it 4 because there were a few loose threads that made it look a little cheap when it arrived - snipped them and they haven't returned. Would give it a 4.5 if I could.
B00JLAJIBM|5|Looks really good on. It is beautiful.
B00O8XP60E|5|Love it!
B00B9I3OX2|5|Good quality and looks wonderfull
B003ADYWL2|5|I have gotten these for my daughter on a number of occasions. Good fit, wash well. Recommend.
B0061ITBNC|4|Loved it!!
B004LULO96|5|I've now purchased 4 of these nursing tanks - for me, these are the best!  I love the coverage that a nursing tank provides (not feeling like I'm spending the day with my now-flabby stomach hanging out), but also found that nursing tanks don't give me enough bra-like support.  These shirts are the perfect compromise, and hook onto my nursing bras with little rubber clasps.  They do run a little long, but I also have found that I appreciate the extra length.
B00UZ71GCE|1|The breast area was waaaay too small. If you have anything more than a b cup I would buy with caution. Really cute but needs to be returned.
B001P06TL8|5|This is the most amazing bra I have ever had. It is gorgeous, well-made, very comfortable & it fits perfectly.
B00FW8OVKA|5|My daughter just loved this onesie for my grandson!It has significant importance because my husband is an avid Fisherman,and especially enjoys it when he sees his grandson wearing it!!!!Just the cutest thing!
B00449SPEG|4|pros:  1- it can handle big bills.  2- soft leather.  3- it has 6 card pockets and 2 hidden card pockets and 2 bills pockets.    cons:  1- no pocket for coins.  2- it doesn't fold perfectly.
B005UJLVAO|5|Fit great , Material is a great weight. I got these for my husband to wear under his sweat shirts this winter , He like these better than Thermals.
B00XPBA82G|5|This dress is just perfect, fits as expected. Thank you.
B00JFF541G|3|Soft but a bit larger than expected.  Doesn't absorb as well as another robe I have, but am hoping that will improve with washing.
B0045H0L1W|1|I can't say that I have tested all 40 of the lights, but I've tested 5 and none of them worked. Two wouldn't light up at all. Three would light up only if you pushed the batteries together in the back. The are very cheaply made, which one would expect given the price, but one would also expect something you are paying money for to WORK, at least the first time you use it. I purchased these to put in party favor bags at my son's fifth birthday. Now I don't think I'll include them because I'm sure most would be either incredibly frustrating or a total disappointment. I do not recommend purchasing these products. (Update: 12 out of 40 were total rubbish.)
B00K326K8Q|3|Love the idea but I bought several different pairs of these Blue Q socks for gifts and it's a real problem that the phrase isn't on the outside of both socks.  You can read the right sock but the left sock is printed on the same side so it's on the inseam side of the sock.  This reads as a mistake or someone being cheap about the manufacturing. Too bad, because the designs are great!
B0085TIE74|5|Look good fit well
B00FG8ETQM|1|The hood is way too small, doesn't keep the rain off.
B00IUOV08Y|5|This tank is great and I got it just in time for July 4th! Watch out for the sizing though! I'm normally a medium shirt size so I ordered a medium and it was HUGE on me. I returned the product and ordered a small. Even though the small fits better it still is a bit big. (Or maybe I am losing weight which is also good) All and all this is a great product and it is made of good quality jersey mesh. Add this to your 'merica wardrobe.
B0002DG810|5|Very attractive and I find them them comfortable winter and summer.  I am pleased with the fabric.  I do not like cotton or flannelette, but it seems that the manufacturers use these day and gowns like the ones I bought fit the bill for meL
B00RKJI4YS|1|I am not sure why I got these instead of Hanes this time, but never again. The second time I wore one pair a seam in the back, right side just opened up, rendering the shorts useless. I hope the others hold up.
B00Q0OMLMU|5|my grandson loves these socks but they were a different color than pictured, but I don't think he cares.
B005SZFBQ0|4|The size is perfect, if you're a 30, order a 30, it fits just right. The cargo pockets are very convenient and I absolutely love them. The only complaint would be that it's difficult to get a belt on them.
B001ACKZ34|4|Nice
B00T6HDLSG|5|LOVE this top! It was the perfect fit for me. I carry my weight in my stomach so I love that it was loose fitting. Very flattering and I have received a ton of compliments. The top comes with a strap but there is a ton of support so its not really needed. A++++
B00I03RGZG|5|Got so many compliments on this dress! It fits normally, so don't order a size larger. The seller is very accommodating if there are any issues. Definitely recommend.
B00I4CMWCA|3|The top of swimsuit was too large.  Hard to keep breasts covered
B00NDPH7H8|5|Love the color
B00485BE9Y|1|Was looking for something comparable to the older maiden form control it panties. This was a total disappointment. The fabric is flimsy and keeps rolling down and the hooks provided underneath are downright uncomfortable.
B00C10F7AK|4|Comfortable material and a good fit. What more could a girl ask for? Something with a sense of humor is what! I got these for my girlfriend because we watch the show together religiously. She absolutely loves them and wished I have bought seven pair so she would have one for everyday of the week.
B00BP16NUO|5|I'm going through chemo and this hat is soooooo comfortable and light weight. I think it will perfect for the summer months and I will be ordering another color.
B00CX0LAE0|4|Levis husky size is a whole lot bigger than I thought. The levi husky in size 14H has a waist of 33 inches compared to the lee 14H which has a waist of 28. For a waist of 28 you need to order the levi regular relaxed fit in a 14.
B000A38CY8|5|The real thing, I just love it.
B00CDTZMWC|5|I am as excited about this product as I have been any other. I dislike shopping for bras. I'm understating my disdain to keep this review professional. I found a brand I love for work and dress, but they are very expensive and I have been looking for a good comfortable moderately priced bra to wear when I'm working from home, gardening, doing yoga, walking or running to the store. Did not want a sports bra because they smash in and give the appearance of a unibosom. I saw an ad for Coobie bras in a little magazine, was intrigued, looked up reviews on Amazon which were mostly positive, took the plunge and ordered some. I have it on right now and love it. Could easily sleep in it. This one is my absolute favorite of the different styles I ordered. I don't know why other reviewers thought the shape looked odd because on me it's as natural look as I had as a perky younger woman, sans bra. There may be a slight teardrop shape to it but not noticeable at all under clothes, and I think that's a natural look anyway. I am very average weight to height, ordered a small and normally wear 32-34D, depending on brand, size 2-4 clothes. I highly recommend this bra.
B00ADX7Z4I|5|This cap is awesome! The color & pattern is great with just about everything and very comfy. The tiny golden flecks add a nice touch, making it great for dressing up or down.
B003TMLP14|4|Nice
B00DW4NC2E|2|I went up a size and it was a good move. I was disappointed when I received the shirt and the letters were folded over on themselves and stuck together. When I pulled it apart it peeled. Fortunately that was only on one small section. I am obviously not going to be able to put it in the dryer. The shirt is still wearable but probably only once. Disposable clothing now?
B00OPZIAN0|4|I'm about 5'5 and I'm a thin person and this fitted a bit tight but it's great! The quality is good too
B004YARPLO|5|Love it.<br />C;
B008UDUJSC|4|It was a bit larger than expected, but the colors are beautiful and the fabric is lightweight. In spite of it being a little big, it's a great addition to my summer wardrobe.
B0060OQJL4|2|Cute out fit.. Pants shrink and  shirt frayed within a wash. Just not worth the price. Don't recommend. Although arrived on time
B00UU6XYPC|4|Really nice colors and they are exactly as shown.  There are tags on the back of each one which was irritating and removed them.  Like the other reviews,  ordered a larger size.  I normally wear a size 7, but ordered an XL and it was snug.  One of them has a small tear only after wearing it once, thus the minus one star.  Really cute, just wish that they were a little more durable, but it is all lacy and dainty.
B00LTP5CJE|5|Large size shrank to the size I wanted in one washing. An earlier reviewer reported that and I can agree with his finding. I'm well pleased with the shirt.
B007I0RAJY|5|My husband is 6'9&#34;, so it's tough finding shorts that are long enough for him. These fit great and were very long! They also don't wrinkle bad and clean nicely. Will definitely buy these again in the future!
B007SX8N4M|5|Super cute!! Worth the money. My daughter spent 2 days in it when we first got it. Very soft and cuddly
B00UL6TQ3K|5|ok
B00OQSCKCI|4|I love her brand and have other pajamas that fit good.
B007VU0DAO|5|My daughter loves this robe. It is beautiful and fits nicely. This robe is just what she was looking for.
B0079071U6|5|great
B0018ONQ58|5|Excellent pants just what i needed for occasion. Great product
B006JN9N5U|1|arrived broken..had to return it.looks cheap!
B009MI6NFW|5|Great underwear. Not sure it's worth $30 but if not, it's pretty darn close.
B00E3HQ3GG|5|Purchased for Grandson, he likes it a lot, he's wearing it- so that's a good sign.
B007WQYF2O|4|It fits me well. Not like most sport swimming suit, there are embedded cups for this one. I like this part very much.
B00R4008II|1|These weren't anything near a &#34;wide leg flare&#34; fit.
B00HRFBNG6|5|Fits great :-)
B00OHDZ1UA|1|So not the size they say!!!
B00UC96M56|1|This blouse is flimsy and clingy. The tassels got tangled and one fell off the first time I washed the blouse (cold water, gentle cycle). NOT AT ALL worth the money.
B00QUEHCOW|5|I love the color and it was exactly what I expected. Love having it connect with other users as well as spreading the fun on being a shark eating everything in sight.
B00DQO3NHO|5|Warm and comfortable for the chill winds of Wyoming.  Well-made, long enough for a 6'4\\" frame and I like it.
B006Z5TU8M|5|My daughter loves her shirts.  We got all three as pictured, however, I guess other people had different experiences.<br /><br />Tagless, comfortable, and has a great retro look.  Very impressed for the price.  Hopefully they make more with other super heroes, she really wants Iron Man and Ant Man.
B007L6IDSC|5|Amazing product, couldn't have asked for a great fit! My wife loves them and wants more! Thank you for a great product!
B00FJ5LI3O|4|Just what I expected!
B00U3MTX8U|3|BEAUTIFUL! But I didn't realize they were from China and I notice that everything from there needs to be ordered a size or two bigger.  Great customer service on the return end as well.
B00VJQLO68|5|My son discovered Blaze and he loves this backpack. I love that it is full size and comes with a lunch tote.
B00O2YL7KC|5|Purchased several of these scarves over the holiday season. Love the size, as they're big enough to wear a multitude of ways, plus use as a small throw on a plane. Great quality for the price.
B008HO6EVA|5|Tried to win one at Michigan Adventure, but I made the boy quit at $6.  Spent $15 and bought 2 so we wouldn't get a pink one...we got 2 red ones.  Perfect item.  Came quicker than expected. I kinda hoped for a pink one for me, but red is great!  We love it, and his face was priceless!
B006AN5U24|4|These have no stretch which is fine but fit a little snug in thighs then seem really loose on my waist.
B00M1U5U2A|5|As always, GREAT stuff.
B000MXQ2PM|4|Let's start with the obvious, I like these pants.  I'm a bit of big guy at 6'4\\" 280 lbs, so shopping for pants can be a bit of chore.  These pants fit almost as I expected.  They are a little narrow in the thigh, but it's not uncomfortable.  I bought one pair to try out and then after several tries I purchased 3 more pairs.  The material is lightweight and comfortable, but not so thin that your legs get cold.<br /><br />I'd recommend these pants.
B00M70EQL0|1|Sizes  run very small
B001EWBWR8|5|positivo 100%
B008EGOKCQ|5|Fantastic wallet! Lasts a long time, super cool! Bought for myself and as a gift for my brother!  Would buy again.
B00MZEZX7Y|5|They were very comfortable and they fit very well
B00HRROL7W|5|Very nice fabric that drapes and moves with your body. There are slits on each side that come up just above the knee on average height people, and the hem falls at ankle for average height people when the dress is worn at the waist. I find it very refreshing to have a maxi skirt that fits at waist instead of at the hip, and the waist band is much better than roll waist for those of us with a 12-inch or larger difference between hip and waist.<br /><br />As a bonus this skirt is easy to launder!
B000OSME7U|3|This is a nice basic hat to decorate. The dark gray is much darker than in the pic.
B00IO51URA|2|its not what I expected,to me it like a cheap t shirt,with spray paint batman on it.
B000HAYQDU|5|While my son didn't want to wear the hat too much, the rest of the costume fit great.  He was about 15 months and already into 18m clothes, but the 12m size we got fit perfectly with some room to spare.  We didn't end up using the Lily pad at all, so that was just extra, but still cute if we would have wanted it.  The material is also thicker so it was a little warmer for going out halloween evening.
B007IRM29U|3|These are quite comfortable, the tags don't bother me a bit, nice material, etc.<br /><br />However, on me, they seem to bunch up in front and actually pull themselves down while I'm walking.  If I'm very conscious of how I adjust them in the morning, I can usually avoid it.  But that's too much thought about how my shorts are positioned, to me.
B00V2KLV2S|5|I love nice model.....
B005N28700|1|Looks cool and original in the photo,but this is definitely an imposta,in more ways than one.I was very disappointed in the quality of the tam and the fake locks.This product is very cheaply made,and also is very itchy against the skin. minus 1star.
B005QZCK5M|5|When you take one look at them, you will think they will never fit; but they do. They are a classier version of fingerless gloves. They fit feel so soft and snuggly that you feel they are worth every penny.
B000TGPTRO|5|I ordered a small for a snug fit, and they're perfect, I love them so much!! They can lose their softness after a few washes, and they can shrink so I recommend washing them on a gentle setting with cold water, but honestly I love this and I expect to buy many many more!!
B008CSKK98|5|I freaking love Mushroomhead omfg one of the most awesome bands that my boyfriend showed me. I love him and as soon as I heard one song from them BOOM I became obsessed. I downloaded all their songs and I even bought this hoodie, which is even more awesome and comfortable to wear. It's like guys have the best hoodies and shirts it's not fair ;-;
B006FDFJDO|2|It was great at first. The bag seemed roomy and had enough pockets. it shipped rather quickly, everything seemed fine. But the straps easily broke and could not hold the little weight i put in it.
B003V4ALFG|1|My husband like this belt for the 2 months it lasted;  The fact that it is a reversible black/brown belt makes it so one needs to rotate the buckle itself around each time you want to switch colors.  And upon one switching, it broke.  Because it was past the return policy, Amazon was reluctant (but did so satisfactorily) replace the belt.  BUT, the new belt (that arrived immediately after the complaint) broke on the FIRST TWIST.  So Amazon refunded it (I insisted.)<br />I would state the above is good enough reason not to risk buying this belt (though affordable.)  In addition, it was just mediocre, as far as style goes.  To look truly professional, I would suggest go with a separate black and brown belts, of course, more of an investment.
B00CN47HS4|3|Nice and loose.  Not sloppy.
B00FX6O926|4|The fit is the right circumference, but not the right shape for my head.  The hat sits much more round then my head so it sat very snugly on the back and fore of my head.
B00KCR8QJS|5|too stretchy after a few wearings.  Order down a size in women's Plus Size.<br />Very Comfortable.  My Laundry should take care of the shrinking so its all good.
B00KU3IT32|3|the swim top was way too small may fits for B-SMALL C UP . the color is close to being neon orange
B007GB5W0O|5|My 17month old baby loves it. Her Mom loves it too so great purchase
B009LBZWJI|3|Well made, fabric quality not as nice as other blended alpaca I have purchased. Perfect to give as a gift.
B008626OE0|5|Very stylish coat, love it!  It was a little longer in the sleeves than I needed it, so I tacked the cuffs under.
B008LU4BK6|5|My husband and I love these!!! Simple, comfy, soft, excellent quality and definitely for my baby. My husband loves them and he is the very picky one when it comes to quality.
B00G5L7WKY|5|Good pick!
B009PN8JMO|5|excellent
B00O9DX9GQ|5|Many many compliments at work on those ties. I'm going to get more of them, different kind.
B001FOR4AO|5|I have used the dockers belts off and on over the years.  I like to way you can adjust in small increments.
B00OQCYMCA|4|Good belt for the price. Exactly as pictured.
B00FLLM9MK|4|A little on the thin side but still long and pretty, that is the only reason why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars. I ordered about 12 different kinds and they got here a lot sooner than I thought they would. I was very pleased with that since they are gifts for my family and friends. I wish I just bought them for myself but I hope everyone enjoys them. Will be buying more soon.
B00N4GFBSS|3|I really like this other than i wish it had some sort of bra support. The part that i didn't like is that when i received the lingerie it smelled super musty almost like mold. It was cheap so ive tried hanging it to air out and airing out in the dryer...no luck. Im going to have to was the sensitive fabric.
B00A74Z6KS|1|The only good thing I can say is that the original ship date was Jan. 29 and it arrived today (12/29). But everything about this is a MAJOR disappointment. The description describes this as a \\"sweater\\" which implies a knit of some kind. Also \\"coat\\"?? This is NOT a sweater coat (although I could tell from the pic. that it was a sweatshirt, it should have been described as a sweatshirt). It's a cheap fabric, cheaply made, lightweight sweatshirt. The design is some kind of plastic material,  not very comfortable. And the sizing is very small. My daughter is 5'1\\" and maybe 100 pounds. She had very little room to move in this.  It was advertised as a women's petite medium. I don't think so. Maybe a child's size small. Overall - very disappointed, am sending it back ASAP!
B000JVOQLO|5|My husband got this t-shirt for Christmas. The size was ideal, the quality of the shirt good and he really liked the design. Thank you!
B00APUTYWA|4|really cool looking and looks just like the pic. little small and definitely smaller then size advertised but it was for my young daughter and it fit my daughter just fine. Nice and thick without being stiff and so thick its uncomfortable. Not thin and cheap either, very soft.  Getting lots of reactions from it. Plan on ordering the other colors.
B001GMAUN8|5|excellent quality I expected
B003X26SBW|4|very goo product ,size was 100 % ,
B00QGBUCW8|4|For the price vest is fine. Not a heavy vest would wear a bulky turtleneck in the winter, also can be worn cool spring nights. Other reviews say can be worn reversed, you can however the zipper functions only on the solid side not the fur side, so you won't be able to zip close & no pockets on the fur side. Quick ship from seller.
B00HLY1F0C|3|pretty, but if you are bigger than a C cup your going to have overflow, I am a DD
B00BJORNIS|4|A good, moderate quality pajama set - good for the price. As with all clothing sets, I really wish you could order tops and bottoms in different sizes. We had to send the first set back my hubby bought me as a surprise as he bought it for my chest size and not my booty size. Curvy women's drawback. So now the bottoms fit great! but the tops a little on the loose side. Oh well.
B008I1ACI8|1|I don't know exactly what &#34;ripstop&#34; fabric is but it's BS. The shorts ripped right by the back pocket and it ripped for a good 8 inches. I only wore them for 2 weeks, ten days total and rip.  I expected more from Dickies clothes line and I am sorely disappointed. I was going to return them via my phone but hate websites on that thing and no way to print, so I waited and missed the return window. Twenty five bucks ripped and now garbage, thanks.
B0018P88G4|5|It's hard to find long cuts in the store, so this was nice to be able to order on line.  I got a better price on Amazon than in the store.  I'm a happy camper.
B00S9MSK26|1|very cheap fabric, I don't recommened it.
B0002TOZ1O|5|I was looking for something thick to replace my Nike socks. These are so comfortable, and seem like they'll last just as long as those Nike's too. Much cheaper, 6 pairs for 17 bucks. I swore not to buy Hanes since they went into the trash so very often. They're cheap, but that's all they are. These are some good socks, without obnoxious branding all over. It does have the gold toe.
B00I1EBZ9C|5|I love my dress the fit was perfect.
B000E0V532|5|I have spent so much money trying to find a truly comfortable bra: supportive, breathable and doesn't feel like you're wearing armor.  I purchased this bra because the price was reasonable and it even looked kinda pretty...what a nice surprise that it fit perfectly (no tugging or adjusting while wearing) and was so comfortable with it's all-cotton construction.  It felt like it had been made just for me.  Great support and separation.  There is no \\"stretch\\" factor in this bra, again it is all cotton so wash carefully to avoid shrinking. The only negatives would be that straps do not adjust and I don't think it's available in any other color but white. I found the sizing to be true.
B0009GG90U|5|Great fit, great product great price
B013RXCKB8|5|This Wallet is cleverly designed and easy to use. The o'rings fit perfectly in place and firmly keep the two pieces together. The O'rings are replaceable too making the the wallet itself built for life. I have managed to get over half an inch stack inside without any issues and I have used it on nights out with just license and some cash. In both cases I found it to be comfortable to carry and easy to use. The Copper has a lush heavy feel and the look is amazing. It is defiantly the only wallet anyone has ever complemented me on.<br /><br />The lack of branding, the excellent design and the beautiful aesthetic together make for a unique item that stands out from run of the mill wallets. Considering I usually destroy my leather wallets every other year or so I am looking forward to saving money in the future with this item that should last me the rest of my life.
B003TP9MAM|4|I got mine a bright red color and the shirt design is really comfortable.  The &#34;cluck for the buck&#34; on Champion apparel is really outstanding...
B0093ZDQM2|3|This dress looks nice on, but it is not very comfortable.  It definitely runs small on the rib cage and the material is stiff and not what I was expecting.  The lace at the waist tended to fold over when I sat down so I was fiddling with it all night.  I would not buy this again.
B00B6EABVC|3|Im a moderately slim guy with a 30x32 pant size, the slim fit looks nice but is a bit restrictive for work
B003RCYXV0|5|super comfortable, very stylish.  Arrived on time.  Great value with all accessories.  Boyfriend loved it - prob going to buy a separate headpiece though.  The one it comes with is as pictured, kind of wide and masculine.
B00L3XYQZS|5|Super cute, very feminine, well made. The detailed stitching around the neck really add to the richness I just love in this robe.
B0091XDJ82|4|Boas lentes em perfeito estado , realmente novas e com ótimos preços . Porém, a lente espelhada é muito frágil para arranhões.
B00HDA3LBA|5|Good
B00RA484YS|4|thank you for a quality product. thank you HANES.........
B00QW4NGHW|1|I've tried 3 different dresses from Stanzino and all of them wore very weird.  the top was okay but the bottom of the dress was for someone with a MUCH larger booty.  looked ridiculous.
B00H5HXINM|5|I love Calvin Klein and I love cowl necks ... this fabric is awesome. There isn't anything bad I can say about this piece!
B00Q464QY0|5|Absolutely love love all the dresses I have ordered! I got these dresses for my bridal party for my wedding and they love them as much as me, maybe more! Completely satisfied witht the dress, and the great communication with seller!
B00NBWBUIA|4|Nice Blazer...well made.
B00AJPKTDE|5|Got the backpack as a Christmas gift.  The boy that got it loved it.  Wasn't an exceptionally sturdy product, but for  the price I didn't expect it to be.  But it was a good product for the money.
B000XYMZT2|3|It is vary dark.  I took off the feather...I'm not a feather type of Guy. It fits as long as I cut my hair that week.
B004QJH3RY|4|Love it for my wallet.  The fit and the way the pictures etc<br />slide in.  However,  my husband has a tri-fold wallet and<br />does not like it.
B00I8ICHDY|2|I'll be giving this to my daughter.
B008RA77D8|3|For the money.. it is really kind of a rip-off.  but oh well, I bought it.  It says, it is heavy.. it isn't it is actually quite light.  It is VERY long.  And the thing I like least about it.. it has a cheap silver colored zipper.  In the photo it looked like a black zipper.  The zipper is way too prominent.  But lke I said.. I bought it.  It will work find - but isn't anywhere near as classy as I had hoped.  It is probably worth $20.00 not more.
B00KGSNBGG|1|The dress I got isn't Dana Kay it's brand called Le Bos..I'll be returning it
B00NW94JJY|5|Very nice leggings!
B00F2YFIR4|4|I bought this for my friend's 2 month old at the time and we always get a kick out of corny pictures and jokes. They absolutely loved it. The quality is acceptable and durable enough to last the short timeframe that the kid will fit in it. Recommended
B00FBQNPD2|5|the measurements are accurate<br />I reduce 2 sizes<br />makes me look thinner<br />What I did not like is that tightens around the chest
B001QS2DH8|5|This hat was order for my friends to wear at a Red hat party.  I ordered them just for fun and they turned out to be adorable.  Very cute hat and not expensive.
B00KZDHIEI|5|Really looks nice. Am glad I bought it!
B0056HZQY2|5|These bike shorts are great.  I have become better friends with my bike these days.  Gel padding in the buttocks and crotch, no tight elastic around the thigh, and a general great fit.
B007277VP6|5|Great wallet!
B002NPCIP0|5|Great price for these durable basics.  Would buy again.
B00B78VOQ8|5|Looks terrific! Nice and slimming and my daughter received compliments at school. Fits right in for the latest fandom :)!
B00MAVN0R2|1|I had a bi-fold wallet before and was happy with it until it wore out. After reading the reviews and description of of this wallet I thought it would be better than my bi-fold. I have never been more wrong. I could not get all my plastic cards from my bi-fold to fit in this wallet. After using it for a while I learned to hate it. The one card holder is sewed into the wallet making like a hinge that flops open every time you open the wallet, making it cumbersome. They could have made it removable. But even then the card pockets are too small making it hard to get your cards in and out. It is already in my trash can.
B0045UKRIQ|4|I love the wallet.....however, the quality I question..... the snaps look like like they aren't going to last long. It's already falling apart and I haven't even had it for two hours.
B00DVEHY6U|5|I love Seven7 jeans for years now. They just get better with age.  These are well constructed fit well and got them at an unbelievable price.  LOVE EM!!!!!!!!!!!
B00MQ1J714|4|Perfect for newborns, but will probably outgrow quickly don't know if it was worth the money
B008G7ISH6|5|the hat fits , I believe its one size fits all, its fine. I don't see any problems with this fit at all
B00CYPXW3Q|4|the hoodie looks really good at night with the lights turned on and in a dark area. quality of the hoodie itself is good, so far no problems. i'm 5ft 8in and the hoodie fit just fine. if the price of the hoodie was a bit lower i would have giving it 5 stars. the packaging it came in was really good. i was impressed with the packaging. i do recommend this light up hoodie
B007W300TE|5|Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas since he loves wolves, Game of Thrones, and the Starks. Did not expect it to be such high quality! It's very thick and warm, and the sizing is great. Not too loose, not too tight.
B0011FPG0M|5|Bought this jacket as a replacement from a 1991 Wilson's leather biker jacket that finally bit the dust. Paid a quarter of what the Wilson cost all of those years ago, and have to say the quality is exactly the same. The leather is stiff and will soften with wear, or you can beat it up a bit to quicken the pace. Zippers are very nice and work smoothly, snaps and belt are also high quality. I imagine this will last our son for years to come. He was wearing my husbands old jacket and it finally wore through in some spots. You get more than you pay for with these jackets.
B00GSY6TOS|4|Very pretty dress. Maybe a little young for me . giving it to my daughter.
B00CN4RJ6O|4|ok...
B0010KXA4W|5|warm
B004GTN7NS|4|Both my kids (3 and 5) have used Baby Banz products since they were babies.  For some reason these skorts are extremely large around the waist.  I got a size 2 years and a size 4 years for my 3 year old and they were both far too big around the waist.  We have to use a safety pin to keep the skort up.<br />Disappointing as we have never had this issue before.<br />Baby Banz still have great quality clothes and we have never had any issues with sunburn.
B00GY4V3EI|5|My favorite sweater! :)
B00MM1THMC|5|I ordered these for workout and well...to work in the yard too as I have a lot of up and downs planting and digging.  My daughter STOLE  the last pair I ordered and loved them too... So one more for me again!
B00I16J2XQ|4|I received this shirt today and immediately put it on. It fits exactly as I'd expected it would. From the pictures, I thought it would be a little bit longer than it is, but I am totally fine with the length. The front comes down to just above my crotchal area (sorry--what do YOU call it?) and the sides are at the top of my jeans. The front panel is crocheted cotton, and the bottom and sleeves are more of a stretchy lace. The mocha color is exactly as shown in the pics. As other reviewers have noted, this is a sheer lace/crocheted top. Unless you are planning on showing some skin, you should plan on wearing a cami underneath.<br /><br />Oh, and it is a princess fit. It hangs nicely, and doesn't poof out too much, but if you have issues with looking preggo in this style of shirt, you may want to reconsider.<br /><br />I am giving this four stars because it is a tiny bit pricey--or at least it seems like it to me.<br /><br />So far, it seems well made. I'll revise my review in a few weeks if it is not holding up.
B0063OROZ6|5|The &#34;standard&#34; Wellie-type boots are hard for a toddler to walk in, and they give my son blisters.  These, on the other hand, are absolutely perfect.  He is 3, and he can put these on himself, and wear them all day without a problem.  The materials are high quality and don't seem to interfere with his walk/balance!  They're also slightly warmer than plain old wellies.  He has 1 pair at school and one at home.  Love them.
B00RKR9OA8|4|This was such an affordable option for my 2 1/2 year old daughter to wear for the flower girl in her aunt's wedding!
B00JK10XWK|1|The design itself is a rip off of someone else's work.
B00G3JEBLQ|5|I was so excited to find these on here for a reasonable price! They are comfortable, breathable and the little gel grip in the back makes them super functional. I will def be buying these again!
B000R1NS4W|3|This patch was so coo...it took long as hell to get here but I guess it was worth it I intend to buy more
B0094GB1V8|5|Very nice causual pants.
B00G6XWTLS|4|Nice but they run small. XXL fit perfectly when a large is normally worn.
B00CJGBNGI|4|The sellers sent me this and another wallet for review. I did not promise a 'good review' in exchange.<br /><br />For the price, this is not a bad deal, if you don't mind the smell. The 'genuine leather' is thin but you shouldn't expect anything fancy for such a low price. And... getting back to smell, think of pungent 'new car smell', maybe times two. I've kept the wallet out on a table for a few days but I can't say that the smell diminished significantly since. I can still smell the wallets from a couple of feet away.<br /><br />The design is okay, if you have lots of credit cards or other credit-card shaped... cards. There is room for 10 of them. There are also two bills partitions and two more pockets underneath the credit card slots of which one is zippered.<br /><br />The wallets lose one star for the overpowering smell which, hopefully will fade away some day. My 3.5 stars rating, rounded up to 4 is so only correlated with low expectations driven by the 10-dollar price (inexpensive). It would be be lower for a more high end/expensive product.
B007IDMVDQ|4|Good looking shirt that has held up well over the last half year! I really like the fit of it (although I felt it fit a little smaller than I expected, but nothing drastic). I feel like Dexter when I wear this shirt!
B00OTI9G5E|3|It is a pretty jacket but the inside lining looks cheap and the fur color doesn't look like the pic. I ordered a 2X and it was more like a Medium
B0029F26CE|4|I needed to refresh my summer hat wardrobe and wanted a pop of color as well as a large brim. This hat filled the bill in both regards. Well made and a more vibrant red than it seems from the picture online, it is a welcome addition to my wardrobe.  I always like Scala hats and have a straw that is twenty years old that I still receive compliments on when I wear it.
B000N8X2K4|5|Perfect fit, sturdy comfortable pants for my son's new job. Delivered when expected. Very satisfied with purchase.
B00D84043S|5|love this sweater
B0083QLQ10|5|It's really annoying to order a different style bra in the same size as you always get and find that it is too small.  That shouldn't happen, but these extenders fix the problem.  I would like to be able to order them in my own color choices though.
B00KSXR138|5|Very flattering cut - fits well.  Looks good not frumpy
B00CM6BLT4|4|For the price it is a decent belt that gets the job done.  It is a good price for a good product
B00EIN2FMQ|5|My son loves this and it being too large hasn't been a problem -- he's grown into it.  He loves being able to wear a robe around the house like Mommy and Daddy, and it's so warm.  It's very cute, too.
B00FRHBTWO|5|I wear it with pride and remember the times in 'Nam (1969-1970).
B009UVEOTS|4|I strongly recommend it.
B00EMAMB7E|2|I was surprised at the flimsy and cheap materials used on this bra. For a strapless that comes in &#34;plus&#34; sized cups you want to feel securely enclosed. It was foamy, rippable material that didn't hold shape well and looked like it would quickly show wear and not breathe well. I'm talking something like a knockoff Walmart sports bra. I returned it.
B00DNO3K9S|5|The comfort of leggings, the look of skinny, the practicality of jeans (back pockets!)<br /><br />Finally a perfect pair of pants for those of us who don't have a perfect body anymore. These are now my go-to weekend jeans - I can still look shapely and stylish without sacrificing comfort. The waist band hugs nicely, never pinches or digs into flesh. The fit is perfect all in all. The lazy in me loves not having to fuss with any buttons or zippers. You can dress them up or dress them down. Great value!<br /><br />I agree with someone else who notes the pants may look small upon arrival. They'll fit just fine and exceed your expectations. Look no further!<br /><br />I went back and bought two more pairs in other shades. They are that awesome!
B0012M667G|5|It's  usually  very hard to find a good bra that fits for large cup sizes,  this bra  fits  perfectly . It's soft, comfortable with good support.it's a great  t-shirt bra, no patterns to show though my shirts. I love this bra so  much  I purchased 3. also got it  here  on amazon @ 1/2 the price in the  department store.  good service and quick delivery  from  vendor.
B003LPUR2M|5|Love these socks - they actually stay up on our daughters feet where most others fall down and then off.  And they aren't super tight on her legs.  GREAT SOCKS!!!
B00FALMPKW|5|The dress is very comfortable and fits very well.  I am 5'8&#34; and 135 lbs and i ordered a size 7. it fits great and there is a little extra room.  The dress has pleats down the center from the neck to the foot.  It adds a nice detail in the bodice that is very flattering.  It zips in the back and there is a spandex lining in the torso and skirt that hits mid thigh.  The dress is very long.  Mine just brushes the floor, but I am a little tall.<br />I was worried about the pleats in the wash and needing to be groomed and ironed but this washed beautifully and only needed to be hung to dry. it is a GREAT dress and I got ample compliments on it. I would recommend it to lots of body types.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B005W8LPP4|3|Not a 2XL as advertised
B00J9B0VNC|5|I am 5&#34;1 so it was too long and I had to have it cut but otherwise, it fit me perfectly.  I was very happy with it.
B004F0E02A|5|love it
B0083EZDS4|5|This is another great shirt.  Fits perfectly and is comfortable.  The flag is nice and subdued, which gives the shirt a distinct look.
B00MHVNS54|4|It's ok
B00CB3CAVQ|5|I purchased this t-shirt as a gift for my Husband.  He was very pleased with this item.  It fits as advertised.
B004IZ244I|5|Love this sweater!  Did run small though.
B009Q0BKZO|4|bought this pair too.  These definitely fit a bit different than the Suki Flap jeans.  The fabric is a lighter-weight which I actually like, you don't feel so &#34;bound&#34; in them- and will be great for summer when you need jeans on instead of shorts.  These do seem to run just a tad bigger than the other Suki's I have- and the inseam of a 30 seems to definitely be more on the 31&#34;+than a true 30&#34;.  They really don't shrink any either after washing/drying.  Overall though, they are really comfortable. Again, they are not the low-cut, hip riding jeans- inseam is a bit longer but for me at my age- I find comfortable.
B005Y1746S|4|I ordered this for my baby boy's baptism. The knit is soft, and fits my baby as expected: he is wearing 6-9 months most comfortably (6 month, depending on cut).  He is a long and lean baby, if that helps.  The knit is a little bit thinner than I'd expected, although the front is lined - but the back is not.  So, given that this is the worst winter in almost anyone's memory, I will put a white onesie under it... no big deal, but that's why it's not 5 stars.  Also, it is bright white... not creamy/gray as the picture shows.
B007PB89SW|3|Were larger than stated.
B0009I4JA0|1|Do not waste your money. Cup size awful with proportion to width. Used typical bra size and even tried a few on in store. It is very long geared as well. I felt HUG in it. Returned almost immediately
B00PVPUC7U|5|My mom really loves winney poohs and just got news mom going to grandmother
B001A6C0O2|4|I bought this item for my wife and she likes the frabric it's made from. These more more durable than the regular scrubs
B00KGKTSRA|5|Good
B001H0F24G|3|Nice fit, but after I used and washed 5 times the material it's going down, I mean bad quality so, they need to get better
B00BZ7AF8E|5|This was a purchase that was made in quickness after reading TONS of other reviews. It does fit well. It has hook clasps in front and laces in back, classic style corset. I wear size medium top and got the large to make sure it fit properly. Which it did. It's supposed to be tight and binding--that's the whole idea. If you don't want it that tight go up 3 sizes. The fit guide worked for me. Be realistic about your needs/wants though and I think it will be fine. The color is gorgeous and I got rave reviews for my gypsy costume with it on.
B003TJ9EXI|1|Dickies is typically a good brand but they farmed this one out to the wrong company. Imagine the brim pointing to the sky while the rest of the hat has about 6 inches of extra material on top pointing to the sky. Completely unwearable.
B00GIG3W6E|5|This is just beautiful.  Seersucker Capri set for spring and Easter.  Haven't washed it yet but it is really cute on the little lady I bought it for!!!!
B00D87C2ZS|5|I'm very pleased with this coat.  It fits true to size and compliments my curvy frame, and the price was right!  Shipping was fast , too!
B003ULNB3Y|5|My husband can't live without his hats and this one is very nice. He even wore one in the hospital after hip surgery.  Delivery was extremely fast and I'm sure he'll be tickled pink Christmas morning.<br /><br />Would definitely buy from this seller again!
B0009JE77E|5|Good fit. Perfect for wearing by itself on a hot day or under clothes when cool out. My daughter is a somewhat chunky 11month old, she fits these in the 24 month size.
B00K28T5CY|5|Fine product that I will purchase again.
B0038U3DJE|5|I bought this for my husband as a gift. He was surprised and loved it! I love it because it washes and wears like a dream, and looks great on. I will buy more of this brand asap. I know my mother used to buy this van heusen shirt brand for my father, and now I see why. Very nice styling and fabric!
B00NSE3S1S|4|I bought this for a race and it lasted all day long with no issues.  When it initially arrived, it had a funky smell, but after it aired out, it was just fine.
B007HKOKHU|5|Love the colors. My boys fought over who would get this shirt when I ordered it. A hit with the teens.
B00T1BIA6U|2|I need to return this item. Ordering my size yielded a dress whose bust line was misplaced and an inability to zip up also due to the small size. It's very pretty and if it were easy enough to exchange, I might get it in one size up.
B00J96Y7VY|1|Too small didn't cover anything
B005JQ3ANY|5|I needed a new sweatshirt and this one fit the bill perfectly. I have enjoyed snuggling it is on the really cold winter days!
B00HNPK186|5|My son loved this shirt.  It fit exactly as expected.
B001PTMWBA|5|This butterfly patch is well-made.  The embroidery has held up well on an item that gets a lot of wear and tear.
B0002TOTA6|1|These socks starting to pill after only a couple of washings, and the toes have holes in them after a minimal number of wearings.  A waste of money and would not buy again.
B000MXKMF8|5|Overall these are great.  They are impacted pretty strongly by static, but that is easily remedied by rubbing lotion on your legs or rubbing a an unused drier sheet on your legs (two tips from my wife which both work very well).  Other than that I would say they are even more comfortable than my normal Italian Wool pants, and less than half the price.<br /><br />I am going to order more, but given the material I am a little concerned what the khaki color will look like.
B00J0R7OEY|5|South Pole never disappoints.  It washes so well and color stays bright
B00V4PW85U|2|This item was way too small. I ordered  a 3x and it came in as a medium/large. So bigger girls beware of this. But they were very nice and gave me back all my money. Much appreciated.
B00OM5AM2U|5|This shirt was exactly what I expected. It was a birthday present for my daughter and she was thrilled.<br />It was perfect.
B00UF7VUCK|2|I'm very much a Large in tops at the moment, but this was huge on me. I'd have returned it for a smaller size, but it has an even more important flaw: it's almost transparent. It's made of extremely thin cheesecloth and is very see-through. Now this might appeal to a younger generation, who enjoy displaying their lingerie, or lack thereof. But I'm pretty sure nobody wants to see what lies beneath *my* clothing. Except maybe my husband. The other problem with this garment is that it's so thin and fragile that it's patently non-machinewashable. I suspect the colors will also run, but I kind of expect that in this kind of garment.
B00LFJ5DC0|4|Fits beautifully.  Definitely not made to be long-lasting, like a Jantzen or Victoria's Secret bathing suit, but it will definitely make it through the summer.  For the price, I think it's a great deal.
B0006B48V0|5|I had to have this product delivered on time for a ski trip where it was going to be VERY COLD (and the trip was very cold)! <br />SnowShack, the vendor I purchased from, delivered the product earlier than promised and im perfect condition - I will certainly look to them in the future for products they sell. <br />The Hot Chillys product works great, I just wore it under my one-piece jump suit versus the 2 or 3 layers I normally wore and I stayed warm and dry, even in storm conditions. The last day of the trip it warmed up and with a little venting, is was still comfortable. I highly recommend Hot Chillys La Montana. <br /> <br /> <br />
B004EZF08O|4|I have worn this alot and love the fact it has it's own little cover up.  The pattern and style are super and it washes pretty well, there is a slight piling on the jacket but very moderate.  all in all this has been a good purchase for me.
B007SLC7KK|4|Snaps are a bit tough to attach to pantyhose but over all it's a good price and sturdy product, thank you!
B008MKU4TW|5|I feel like I found a gem - have the belt so I can mix and match my wardrobe with ease now. This fits well on 120 lb 5'2&#34;, not too snug and looks great. It is a good navy blue, not almost black which is hard to find. The belt buckle is definitely upscale so you can wear to the office or out - it is antiqued burnished brass which I love and adds a bit of chic to any outfit.
B00FRYCUP2|5|Beautiful wallet for the Benz lover.
B00JYC20H6|5|Everything was great!
B009IUJSZG|3|Very stylish and looks good. Very loose fitting I wouldn't recommend running or biking with it. Also very ventilated not very warm.
B003VYALAQ|5|9 weeks old and counting... zutano caps are the only ones thst didnt get all stretched out. in comparison, gerber sucks, touched by nature sucks. zutano is cutest, most well-made. our go-to caps. expensive but worth it!!
B004SYQ7YM|3|The color and beading on the dress is very different from the picture shown. I'm not satisfied with this purchase
B00CTLVVEC|5|I always wore the old 505 regular fit Levis, but when I wore them all out and started to replace them, I found that the new 505s were more like a loose and/or sort of baggy fit.  I picked up a pair of used straight skinny 514s on line just to see if they fit me any better.  Well, guess what- the 514s fit me like a glove!  They are just like the old 505s used to be (except for a slightly lower rise), so since then I have purchased a bunch of 514s, and they all seem to fit me just fine.  The lower rise isn't low enough so that you'll look like J.B. walking around with his undies flapping in the breeze.  You guys who liked the old 505s should really try the 514s- I'm sure glad I did!
B00FYF33OQ|4|Good buy. Would recommend.
B00F356PPG|1|It would have been the right size (if worn for short periods - cheap binders are cheap binders, after all) but with the lack of straps it falls down CONSTANTLY. The straps it came with broke in about five minutes. Not worth it.
B005C9G8LO|5|I like these undershorts. They are cotton and comfortable.
B000OVEOTS|4|Nice
B00FN0FMNW|5|These socks are very nice although the color of sage is a little off. I purchased these to wear with a sage dress and the colors don't fit. I love the socks. They make the dress very elegant.
B009FV8GWO|4|Good..
B0013F6A32|3|Great bra,but too tight for me. Loved the color.
B00SA646GK|5|Fit was perfect.  My daughter loves it!
B00OULP3IY|2|Flimsy, expensive, shrank wit hjust one cold wash.  Lame
B00A6MZKEI|4|Great top.  Only issue is that the buttons were not reinforced very well and you will want to sew them on better when you receive the item and before you wear it.
B00BURJSK0|5|Products is exactly as stated. The lace adds a nice, feminine touch. This has been perfect for me to wear post mastectomy.
B00EZ71ZBC|5|This is a wonderful top - beautiful crimson red color, roll-tab sleeves that have enough stretch to stay pulled up to elbows if that's the way you want to wear it.  Hangs perfectly; fits very well (Small - I'm 5'2.5&#34;, 34 bust, 124 lbs) - not too tight, not too loose.  I'll order another in a different color.  The lace insets dress it up, but also perfect w/a pair of jeans!
B001ETQGCC|4|This costume is really well made and cute as all get out. The only issue we had was that the hat was a little big and fell down over our toddler's eyes. A quick safety pin adjustment would fix it.
B001FOR0W6|5|First it looks very good. I use it everyday now. And the belt is high quality. I love this belt. The price also is good.
B002HJ3DGA|5|The women I got these for did ask for them but she also called to tell me they were just what she wanted. These are not the nylon type of knee highs and they are not the thicker knee socks you would wear with sneakers or boots. They are a good knee sock to wear with dress shoes, but warm enough for winter wear.
B000ZZHSHI|4|Ok... this was a very nice mask for Halloween.  However it is made of rubber so it makes you sweat like crazy.  I didn't like that aspect.  I was literally HOT!!! the entire night!  However, it goes well with any catwoman get up.  Really liked the realistic look of this mask.
B001A3UECK|5|I got these for my boyfriend for work because he needed a new pair of work shorts. They looked great when we got them and because he &#34;loves pinstripe&#34; he was conflicted about using them for work, so I ended up getting him another pair that he keep looking clean and sharp :)
B000FPU16I|3|I have worn it for two years, good product.
B00S1OB09C|3|I liked the hat, but it wasn't the same as the picture shows it to be
B00U78SQCO|2|To small
B00K6CYCBA|5|Like these pants for work.  Drape well, nice weight, clean cut.
B0050AFX9S|5|Great quality
B000YV3T3K|4|My father loved this item. The jacket fit just right. The price was excellent. I would purchase from this vendor again. I would only ask to have other colrs available. I rate this item very good.
B004Z8OMHA|5|Very comfortable.  Perfect for Dr. Seuss  Day!
B00LTG5798|3|This shirt is awesome and soft.  The only issue is it is way bigger than expected.  The shirt says small, but is drowning me and I usually wear a medium...
B00412FXUA|5|Feet didnt really fit but was worth every penny. Costume was a big hit
B0041D7WX0|5|My husband is 6 feet tall and about 280 and it fits him perfectly.  It's very warm and good for doing outside chores.
B0018OMOU6|4|Ok, I'm 6'3&#34; and a fairly skinny dude. My legs are longer than my torso by a little bit. I have trouble finding jeans that fit me -- my legs are super thin and it seems like the waists I buy are so uneven from company to company. Sometimes a 32&#34; fits, sometimes it's a little big, sometimes it's waaaaay too small (if it's a true 32&#34; -- which doesn't seem to happen much anymore).<br /><br />I bought these because usually a 35&#34; inseam is good for me and these were supposed to shrink by 3&#34;. They didn't. Not even close. I managed to make it work by cuffing them, and it doesn't look bad or anything, but they didn't shrink as advertised. I soaked them twice in hot water, so I did it correctly. Also the waist didn't really shrink much either. That might be a factor of the jeans naturally stretching though, since I have a little stomach that stretches pants out when I sit (like most people do).<br /><br />Anyway -- I think I should have ordered 32&#34; x 36&#34;. Then it might have contoured my body a little better. As it is, they're still pretty big. I have a flat guybutt -- not much going on back there. And these don't do much to help me out. I guess I would just say this -- don't count on the enormout shrinkage that they're promising -- I didn't encounter that at all.
B004BIWO3I|5|Bought this for my son.  He wears a 10/12 so I went with the small and it fits perfect.  Good quality.  He just loves it!
B0052EU8U6|3|I'm 6'2 and 185lbs. I ordered a Large and it was extremely tight, and not nearly long enough for arms. Now maybe I'm just a bit to tall for this, but medium and large generally always fit me. I think an extra large would've fit me a bit better.  The fit notwithstanding, the jacket is a decent jacket with excellent design choices. I think it looks great when fit right. One problem I have is the quality of the material. It's nearly that of a nice button up shirt. I wish it were a little warmer, and I could only see this as an early fall jacket. With the material being so thin, it's hard to justify a price of $112 or even the discounted $56. I'd say it should be around $35. The design is excellent, the jacket looks great, but the materials used are not the best IMO. The fit was off as well and that hurts the star rating.
B008726FRU|4|these wings are beautifully designed the color is outstanding made my parrot cost to pop. yes I would definitely recommend this product
B004DZOCE8|5|I am a 34DD, which is a hard size to find anywhere (internet included) and then when you find a 34DD it might fit weird. This bra fits great and is really comfy and soft on my skin. After the first one I bought, I went ahead and ordered it in every color!<br /><br />The only downside is that the underwire is squeaky. When I move my arms it makes a lot of noise.. Hopefully that will go away after I wash it
B0047N0MYK|5|These Dockers pants are exactly as expected.  Fit very comfortably.  Expandable comfort waist is a plus.  And finally, able to find Dockers pants that are pleated front, and CUFFED.  Excellent  product.
B00D5X6NAA|5|Great gift!
B009I66B5K|5|Lovely and effective to protect the knees when crawling whilst looking cute and girly!<br />Allows for quick and easy pamper change too! :)
B0047BI50K|5|cute
B00BQWWIEC|5|Love Democracy.  Light shirt for hot days.  Only had this for two days before my daughter took it.  Very pleased with quality of top.
B008PDBWBA|5|Love this robe. Wore it in hospital after baby was born and it was perfect. It was great having pockets and the fit was awesome.  I love that the tie is build in so you don't have to worry about the tie coming out of the loops etc.
B002L16PUA|3|This top is very cute.  The back is see thru - no lining under the lace, which I thought made it even better.  The small is very small - so I returned it.
B004A7XXVM|5|These are a great fit.  These do not bunch or ride up your behind.  I have purchased these several times.
B00WQZ1FTC|2|Very very small. Pretty color. I gave it away.
B00DFKM0AU|5|Although I was hesitant ordering a jacket for 100 dollars; the product when opened satisfied me to the fullest. The sleeves felt very smooth along with the body material which was slightly soft. The Ferrari logo on the left side stands out great, which receives a lot of comments whenever I wear it. The fit was nice as well.
B00M94O8QM|3|Design and everything were nice.<br />My problem is that I got a faulty pair with a hole in the fabric on the left side of the groin area.
B00SPP4PBM|5|love my new dress! so comfortable !
B0037XTI8C|4|I bought this one to replace the 40x39&#34; one I had.  the 42x42 may not seem like much of a difference, but it really does.  I actually wouldn't mind one in 50x50 or even ones that were made of a little heavier material for the brutally cold days.
B00EPRMU1Q|4|These slippers are very comfortable, the fit is amazing. The only thing that could be a turn off is they are very thin, I would consider these a minimalist's slipper so if you like are thicker slipper then these are not your choice but overall they are great!
B00QJV4GNQ|5|Gave as a gift to an Army.  She thought it was wonderful.
B00IVD3OC4|5|It is warm but don't make you sweat, like it very much
B00IV3HK3I|4|Satisfied
B00W0DMVO8|5|Exactly what we wanted.
B00HSYXWOM|4|I really like embroidery, so in spite of the fact this was 100% polyester, which I usually avoid at all costs, I gave it a try.  The style is cute, but a little bigger than a standard Miss Me top.  I find the brand to normally run small, and this was true to size, if not a little bigger, but I think that's the style they were going for.  I am keeping it to wear as a cute, slightly oversized cardigan.
B00KC0IRLC|5|LOVE THESE! Exactly what I was looking for. Very comfy and warm. Great to wear even with a crop.
B00J2TQ5OU|5|I had the Levis 512 boot cut jeans and already knew how much I liked the fit, but needed a black pair. I decided to try the straight[legging] style in the same jean and I love them. I have long legs and they fit perfectly. The slimming fit is nice and very comfortable. The waist is a little bit higher than I am used to, but surprisingly not annoying and don't look like maw-maw jeans. The jeans look nice enough to be worn as casual or for a night out!
B00IOUDY5G|5|Good product simple
B00EIMYRYG|4|If you have deep back pockets it wont but if you have small back pockets this will pop out.  I do really like the way it looks but it is longer than I was expecting and juts out.  Sometimes I worry it will easily get plucked out even with the chain so i tend to swap it out with another wallet when wearing pants with shallow back pockets.
B00ZB7ZN68|5|Bought for my daughter. She loves them.
B00IQ7PCV6|5|great for the money
B00MS4RNKG|1|these are a joke. They are not gel lined, nor are they compression. Use your money for a cup of coffee.
B005JD3V0O|5|they fit perfect please do soemthing abt this reveiw making you say more than need to be it will not subit<br />buttons umnless you add more words I like the socks
B00B1UN6S6|5|Excellent suit!  Paul Frederick is a great company.
B00MPEDH18|1|This was suppose to be a birthday outfit good thing I had a back up plan .....it said 2xx in the tag but came in small extra.... Very upset....
B00J1XB0HY|5|I bought the wine red color and it is pretty. These run large though. I bought a large and I'm swimming in it. I'm going to try a medium next.
B001GK0EZY|5|My husband has had three spots removed from his bald head he lives in hates these are nice and reasonable price.
B003HC92LQ|1|These are supposed to keep your feet dry and cool.  They don't seem to do either of those things...  My feet sweat just as much as before, and the material doesn't wick it away.  Plus, since the material is so much thicker than normal socks, my feet are hot constantly...  I tried to take my shoes off the other day to let them cool off, while I was sitting at my desk, and it smelled so bad I had to put them back on...  I had this rating at 2 stars when I started, but after writing it, I bumped it to 1 star...  I had really high hopes, and these failed in every aspect...
B000FK666C|3|Cute but not made for big boobs. I gifted it to a friend instead of returning.
B00LUZX4DY|2|too large,next time i must buy a small
B00AWS9272|4|Whether you're a super stealth camper or \\"high visibility cool guy\\" this is great stuff to have in your pack.<br />As a low visibility camper in the past returning to camp after a night of pillage and plunder can be a challenge making you wondering why Tom Bodett, didn't leave a light on or did some polecat raid your camp!<br /><br />Hang this reflective cord up and a simple light source can get you to camp or keep you from tripping over anchor points and hanging yourself on the ridge line. I carry this paracord with #36 bankline in my pack but this reflective cord has all kinds of uses if your into manly macramé. Use this to wrap things you always wanted a thicker grip or easier to find in the dark like that life saber you're always talking about!<br />Like all reflective material it will diminish with tons of use but the orange color will be there besides you're not buying a BMW here so buy two if you can. Using a little super glue on the ends or before you cut to length (let dry first) will keep it from fraying unless you love the smell of toxic burning cord in the morning!<br />As paracord goes it is a little pricey but think how many \\"Cool Guy\\" points you'll score when you whip out your Neon Orange Reflective cord on the trail.<br />No five stars, it's cordage so unless it comes with GPS, fire starter, water finder, Broom Pilot detector(Witch/Ex-Wife alert)it only gets four stars!<br />Keep walking and stay thirsty my friends!
B00KA3KFGG|3|Had to give this one away also
B00HN53CI2|5|This jacket fits exactly as expected - and very well. It's warmer than I thought it would be, so it might not last all the way through spring. Stylish and snug.
B0060FHT26|1|Cheap Material, Just overall cheap feeling. Not as pretty as in the picture . I must say I was so excited to receive this dress and I ended up sending it back.
B00R7OEQRU|5|I love this dress! Sexy and comfortable. Even better than I expected.
B00KR4WQ5Q|5|Great … Thank you :)
B00AVBFH9M|3|It was okay , it looks good but it feels a little cheap , overall good product and I do not regret my purchase
B00HQQN2TW|3|I like the dress and the fit. The material is thin but ok for tropical climate.<br />My concern is the construction it is poorly done, it is as if no one checked the finish product.<br />On my first try of the dress there is a large opening at one of the sides it is not properly stitched.<br />This seller needs to check the items they are mailing out to customers, we spend our hard earn money to buy their product and need to be assured that we get value for it.
B00UXZMQKY|5|My new favorite blouse. Love the color!
B007PESS5I|4|My son loves them. They are very colorful.<br />I would highly recommend these to any one looking for something like this.
B009F6HRTW|4|Great colors but socks are a bit thin
B000FLD4AC|5|This top really looks good on. Runs a bit small. I am a size 6 & the medium is perfect. I would not call it ribbed, but it feels good on the skin & is soft. The orange is a great color, near a poppy color. The scoop neck is low-scooped just right. The sleeves give you a little room at the end of the sleeves, so it doesn't look tight. The hem/finish all around is nice, not cheap. The length is good in these days of too short shirts. A good buy.
B007C2PYHS|5|These shirts were great for my children.
B00KTDA5A8|5|Best sweatshirt around! Love it!
B000MXLYF0|5|The fabric is light and very wrinkle resistant. Sheds stains well since my work environment tends to get a little bit of oil on them. The elastic sides have ensured a perfect fit for me. Build quality is good as always with Haggar.
B00P0DIEIW|3|I bought these socks for my nieces, 3 and 5. The socks are too big for them reaching up to their knees.
B00KN3Z8T2|5|Very comfortable. They stay up without any marks on skin.
B008JD40QK|1|Very pretty, but huge. Would only fit a 6 month old.
B00F3BMV7Q|3|TOO small
B00JDVH78A|4|I like this shirt a lot.  Good fit, as expected, thin-ish fabric but not so much that you have to wear another top under it.  The seam down the middle is ok, wish it weren't there but honestly it probably helps the fit with having it there.  I got the medium and I am a 10-12 size.  Fits well.
B00A9R2P7A|3|I bought this tie to learn how to tie a bow tie...tie.  I have a pretty thick neck and this worked.
B00Q89SNVA|4|I was very pleased with the dress except that it was quite a bit long. I'm 5'3&#34; and after I had bought some 4 inch pumps the dress was still pretty long. My mother she was able to hem it four more inches to make it a nice length. The jewels, the fabric, and the corset tie in the back are all very beautiful. The top did roll forward a little but not too much to the point it looked bad.
B00YCREW2O|5|Good stuff!
B00E01QZP4|5|Great hat, smooth transaction
B00ESMW2W0|5|Luxuary dress
B00FGQY1V2|5|Love it
B00GNZKHM2|2|I couldn't get these over, um,my assets. So snug had to lie on bed to zip. Not good.. the quality is there though if they had more sizing I would size up..
B0062WA3IE|4|I have a rather large bust so I got this in a bigger size than I thought I really needed- the waist was still a bit big (laced that part up as tight as it would go) and while the top was snug I will have to wear something under it lest I fall out. The corset is pretty good quality and doesn't- initially- have the issues of bowing out. It is a bit longer in the torso then I am- but it covers the flaws nicely (even if it will prove a challenge to sit in). All in all, it is a good corset with solid construction.
B0050AFZ96|1|I am returning this product. The description states that it is generous length, but it is not. The description is incorrect. Fruit of the Loom does make a generous length t-shirt but that is not what I received from Amazon.
B00GXVLLHG|3|I usually wear a 27 and these are very big in the waist but otherwise are flattering pants. Collect a lot of lint unforntately
B00RSETSGI|5|Great shorts!  Fit true to size and very comfortable in and out of the water.  I would definitely recommend you pick up a pair if you are hitting the beach or pool this summer.
B00BPPXTC0|5|Wonderful quality, relaxed and pleasant to wear. Great color combination. Fits true to size. Can be worn as a cover up it a sleeping tunic.
B00N6XREZC|5|Excellent product!
B004DNVP40|5|just got them in the mail and tried them on and they fit perfect, they sit just right above the knee like in the picture. I will buy some more
B003IH8R9S|5|It was exactly what I was expecting on the costume
B005OFLTFG|4|Good quality but the size is too big for XL.. Also the legs are too long. The material is soft but a quite thick. So this boxer is more appropriate for autumn or winter seazons than for warm weather.
B004SE2IPO|5|great fit, great material, great hold-up after 2 washes so far.  these can be good for going out, working out or working.
B00L4A79HW|2|I got the largest size, and still booty shorts.  I normally wear a medium, so if you do get largest size. Not sure why the woman has to be topless in this photo either, seems a bit silly.  The design is adorable, but a bit pricey for cotton shorts.
B00CFG1Z1U|2|I thought it would be a sheer type of feel but its not its rough and the material makes the jacket look like plastic foam. As much as I hate the material I need something for my maid of honor we will see what happens....the only thing that makes it look good and pop is the jewel
B00S0KWPBE|4|The bottoms fit great, but the top is a bit too small. Overall a very cute suit!
B00I00JJCC|5|Who could ask for anything more the quality that velvet is known for At the prices Amazon offers very please
B00U6QX2VW|4|shrunk quite a bit after washed
B0087J7YZK|3|There's no comparison to Spanx. It's fine as a slip but don't expect it to smooth everything out. It's not that powerful. &#34;Firm Control Shaping&#34; is perhaps a bit optimistic. Not that firm but for the price its fine. Its what I expected. I'll try the Medium just for fun.
B001KBSY42|5|I bought this gown for myself as a treat.  I saved wearing it until I was in the postpartum room.  It was wonderful.  The shoulder snaps are angled so it stays on your shoulder even while nursing offering more modesty and warmth.  It is a durable cotton...light but thick enough to be decent.  I at least felt like I was wearing something presentable rather than the thin, over sized, not always pretty hospital gowns.  Pictures turned out great holding my little girl while wearing a fun gown (that really looked like a dress).
B00FVCLTRA|4|Good look and fil!
B00NLMZ2HA|5|So I only have a few days experience with this wallet but it is fantastic. I am in law enforcement so I have an absurd amount of id's, certification cards and other credentials so I could definitely use about 8 more slots but it simplifies my life so much that I don't even care.
B00FRY5ZBS|5|I purchased 2 of these wallets and both my guys (hubby n son) love them. :-)
B00FVXDFBW|5|Love it! Wish it came in more colors! I have the white and the black!
B00HSHR6KK|4|These are great!  But way too big for my almost 3 year old.  I'm guessing another month he might fit in them.  His shoe size is 7 to 7.5. Love the colors.  They are shorter than the ones he normally wears so I still need to see if he likes them.
B006SFRMN4|5|After the first day of wearing these there is a split about i 1/2&#34; long in the seam. Frankly, I am too lazy to send them back and they keep me warm under my jeans. I will definitely buy another pair. I just bought one for my husband as well! Yes they are that good. Even with a hole, I am buying more.
B00KJ2BWHO|5|The mask was so comfortable and light weight that I was able to dance all night wearing it.  Looked great with my costume.  Thank you.
B001IIA87I|4|I bought the 1X, figuring that it would be like an XL, well, it is far too big.  I could fit my entire neighborhood in these with me!  I normally wear a size 14 to 16, or a large or extra large in bottom pieces..  These are really pretty and I want them for wearing with skirts that have a slit.  Regular slips do not work as well with the slits in some skirts and these are the answer.  I ordered the beige and they are more like a yellow-beige but a very pretty color.
B00KA69T88|5|love these...will buy again!!
B00GYX2N20|4|Somewhat comfortable
B0053WZGRC|3|Not very bright.
B0007CKN2G|5|Tried another brand they where to long (even as a 38x29)<br />These fit as they should!
B00L320WXO|4|this is a very cute coat.  Sent it to my granddaughter in Alaska.  She just turned four and I bought a size 5.  She isn't a very big girl and it fit a little but not so big that it doesn't look good.
B002JP1JQ8|5|After tracking down a tee shirt with Jehtro Gibbs on for a birthday gift, I was very pleased with the service I recieved from ordering this item to actually getting it.  The tee-shirt was well made and the transfer of Jethro Gibbs across the front was perfect......  Needless to say it was excellent value for money, fast delivery service from USA which included a 20% gift voucher of my next purchase.....I will recommend this item and others like it.....  And of course the person I gave the t-shirt too for her birthday hasn't stop smiling....... great service.
B0086TTD4Q|3|Cant button.. so I wear it open.  Like the color and fabric tho.
B00MDUKY8S|5|Cute, very innovative design, includes a case for storage in your glove compartment.  I found that it looks better on me if I wear the hat it with the tag side in front as opposed to the back of the head.  very cute
B00KBPS9N4|4|Nice looking shirt and am happy with the fit on my son.
B00CE45LV8|5|The four year old loves it ! Perfect match with his Unionbay Brooks 360 Camo Cargo Pant, purchased at the same time from Amazon.com. Well made, soft and rugged. Was worried about the light color of the lower sleeve, but with a light pre-treat, the crayon and ketchup came right out in the wash.
B00NQE5XY0|3|Cute but I really wish they were maternity shirts... They just don't fit right. It's like wearing my husbands tshirt.
B00P7R9FNY|4|it has some smell
B005C9GLZC|5|I bought a 5-pack to try them out, and about a week later I ordered another 5 pack.<br />The fit is just right  for me. But be advised it is a little on the small side of its range. For example 34-36 is closer to 34 than 36. They are thin but comfortable.<br />They seem well-made. I expect them to last quite a while.<br />I will buy these again.<br />Recommended.
B00KCS2TXG|5|Love this.  I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  So 90's in the best way.  Wish it had pockets.
B00G9YT4HQ|5|wonderful color
B004M6UD46|2|If you REALLY need to haul a lot of cards and cash around and have big pockets, this is a good wallet for you. Otherwise, look for something smaller.<br /><br />With a card in every pocket, this wallet will be thicker than a roll of quarters. When opened flat, it is about 1.5 times the length of a U.S. dollar and about 1.3 times the height. I cannot comfortably sit on this wallet with it in my back pocket.<br /><br />Material and workmanship of the wallet is perfectly fine for something in this price range. I don't expect it to last many years, but I also don't think it will fall apart in one or two.
B00AKL0I2E|5|This mask was totally worth it.  It fit so nice and the look was amazing!
B003917UJG|3|Too large for my newborns. Awkward fit. Would've also preferred Velcro underneath for chin instead of tying in a knot
B00V3D0W42|3|I AM NOT A GREEN FAN. THE NECK AND ARMHOLES ARE EDGED IN GREEN.THERE IS NO GREEN IN THE FABRIC. THIS TOOK AWAY FROM THE OVERALL LOOK. WITH A COORDINATING TRIM THE DRESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DARLING.
B00R7447VA|4|My rhinestone pieces were broken but the teddy fit better than I expected
B00N8L2HK4|1|Material is very cheap! The dress sleeve is very tight for my arm, and I order for size medium which is my size. The dress look nothing like the one in the picture. The length is short, it doesn't touch the floor. I haven't wear it since I got it .
B00JZYJBMU|5|Like very much. I went one size down.usually wear  a 12 but returned and kept the 10.
B005VEN2YG|5|Oh my goodness I love this beanie! It is too adorable! I love love love it
B006VOV288|5|I found these jeans 4 or 5 years ago and I was so surprised to find a pair of jeans that fit me so well. I don't know what I would do if they ever quit making them. It is so hard to find a pair of jeans that fit my hips AND my waist and these do. Great job Levi's.
B006H9S5E6|5|Love this belt.  Easy to adjust so it always is a perfect fit.  I plan on replacing all of my traditional hole style belts with these!
B00LN4O2SI|5|Love them they are awesome.
B001FOO8C6|3|I'm not a big girl around 28 size jeans and I had to drill an extra hole for it to fit but once I did that it fits and is great for the price. Flat shiny studs.
B004CO6UGI|5|Very soft- my sons do not complain about the elastic waistband
B00NTWM0S6|4|Great dress, runs small - order a size up.
B00JQ88R7K|5|yea its good
B00AKSCK3M|5|ive washed them three or four times so far and no noticeable wear.i use them for jogging. nike charges way too much for compression shorts!
B002E3BKCI|5|Very comfortable and the hem around the top will prevent the fraying ,I've had with other brands
B00LV2EZXO|5|Very nice jacket. I thought it is a tan color when I ordered it, though. It's like a dark gray. It runs small. I gave it to a skinner teenager who really likes it.
B0046M8Q2W|3|and slippery material means the tie has to be tight to hold it together.  Otherwise very comfortable (unless you have to reach high to get something...sleeves become tight in the shoulders.  Definitely a good deal for the price though.
B0081KRNPG|5|WAS Very Surprised on How SHEER these are. I bought Sheer before and WOW I love these and So Does my GF AND VERY nice Fitting on Both Sides of it
B00S2AN4XA|5|Love this jacket!  Soft and stretchy as a sweater.  Hubby said it looked a little dressier than the Levi styles I tried on, but still has the traditional jean jacket look, so it suits my 50+ year old style just fine.  Washed before wearing, as instructed on the label, and hung to dry after a quick 15 min spin in the dryer, and no shrinkage whatsoever.  Very happy wih this purchase!
B00AR3OXZ8|1|I am very disappointed with how tiny this shirt is. I ordered an xlarge. It fit like a medium. On top of that, the print was crooked. I am returning this.
B006HT1X18|4|I like this shirt! I bought around five shirts off of Amazon and they seem to be very close in quality and price. The Harrington shirt is as advertised, and I would not hesitate to order another one or two. With that being said, the shirt fits great, washes easily and doesn't wrinkle too badly in the dryer, steams really easy to get rid of the wrinkles and it looks good. Make no mistake, this is not an expensive shirt, but it is a quality shirt for the price. I have worn this around fifteen times and it still looks like new, the threads are tight, it has not shrunk and it just works. For the price this is a great shirt, give it a try if you are on the fence about the purchase. Lastly, the shipping and packaging were very well done.
B00I0LORKK|5|We ordered this for Nana. She lives in the desert and wants something that keeps her covered but not hot and that also keeps away the evening breeze. She says that it does just that and that she can wear it to bed. I have not see it on her but she says its great.
B00BNB36ZG|5|I bought for a gift, I'm sure she will love it. Pretty and lightweight. Very stylish. Was a SUPER deal!
B000JHFX1U|5|Fit great.
B005UT32Q0|5|The product arrived on time and it fits great.  Nice material and they feel comfortable and warm.  Very pleased with the product.
B00RW759DW|5|I love this skirt! Very short and flirty ;)
B00QDB9MJ0|5|Bought this for my son for his culinary class. Shipping was fast, product description met my satisfaction.
B00LIUYJUI|5|I brought this outfit for my granddaughter for christmas, well let's say I brought acouple outfits from here. There all just beautiful! And fit perfect, she can wear this too preschool. She loved her outfits! Will buy many more from this site for sure. I am glad I found this site, there cloths r well made and have style!
B001MOIFH8|5|The size are good if you baby is not so large. My baby is close to 2 yrs and fit perfect buy I Know she is very short. For a normal o biger size baby I recomeded to purchase this for babys from 6 monts to 1 yr.  Quality 100%. Washer y dryer always and don`t have loose of color.
B000YOVVAK|2|The overall looks of this benie are great. The material is very warm. The problem I have with this product is the size. I prefer a beanie that fits snuggly on my head. This is closer to a ski mask size and I don't like to roll them up to fit.
B006OFV90K|5|Use this belt on the Alice frame and you will wonder<br />why you didn't dump the USGI belt years ago.<br />No joke, try it, you'll like it.
B00FJ5LI3O|5|Was a gift and he loves it. Has more room than his old one that popped at the seams because he had so many credit card and ID's to put in the other one
B007S01VP8|4|The costume is very nice and comfortable, it should cover more part of the neck, and the sleeves a bit longer. But I use it with my child and he loves it.
B00IKFWBQS|5|Love these pants! Fit perfect and soooo comfy!!
B004C1BTBM|4|I am a pear-shaped size 14-16 and this dress works beautifully for me. I had to take it in at the armholes but other than that it fits well. I am about 5'8\\" in heels and the dress hits me just above the knees so it is definitely not too short. The fringe is flimsy and be prepared to lose some of it. the dress is see-through in certain light so you may want to wear it with a slip, but overall it is a good halloween costume--comfortable and cute.
B00VQ2ZCJK|3|A little shorter in length than I expected.  Very lightweight fabric.
B009V5GO1E|5|Christmas present for my husband who is a huge fan of Breaking Bad.  Well made T shirt and the fit was true to size. For reference my husband is approx. 6'3&#34; and a muscular 220 lbs.  The XXL fit him well.
B00TK153CA|5|Great price, cute dress
B00PUZBC8E|5|Soft, comfy. Good for a Christmas party, Christmas morning or just general lounging.  I wear W women's medium, but wanted it oversized, so I ordered a L, definitely a men's large! It still worked.
B00BNTM16I|5|I was a skeptic for many reasons...but I was honestly overly impressed with the quality of this corset. It's thick, heavy, durable, yet still comfortable (for a corset). Shipping was only a few days..just follow the sizing chart and you can't go wrong!
B00VWJPGOI|1|My shirt came today and it's says &#34;texas&#34; and &#34;texas&#34; the word 'not' was left off the 'not texas' part.
B00DWN8HM0|5|No seam splitting your sac in two.  Great soft seam.
B00HQ9QHGO|5|My son wears this to social functions while in college and receives many positive comments from his peers
B009SRRB3K|5|I received my HAPPY shirt as a gift and am really pleased with it.  It runs true to size and launders beautifully again and again
B0011BEDJG|5|This little bag is just perfect for travel.  I'm a road warrior and needed something light weight but large enough to hold my stuff when I travel without aggravating a back condition. This has been the perfect solution!  It's attractive, light weight, and roomy inside.
B00KM2A65A|5|Love the dress.
B004ETQ2J6|5|this pair of socks were very good quality and great vibrant color. The shipment came fast and was packaged well
B000P9ECGO|4|...But I really like this bra. To me, a &#34;t shirt bra&#34; sounds like it wouldn't have enough support. But i really like this bra and intend to get more next time a bra shop.
B00GBVTAGM|5|Very nice shirt. It fits nicely and is a good price for a quality shirt. I have no complaints. Would highly recommend.
B00GS90EA8|4|Chemo gift for my cousin.  She loved it! Helped lighten the mood as we had a hat party when her chemo started.
B002HJ3DKG|1|I purchased the m/l which should fit 7-10 and they would not stay on my feet.  my shoe size is a 9 1/2 medium width.  I tried. I really tried. Theses did not fit the toe not heel and slipped right off the moment I inserted my foot in a show.  I'm disappointed as I have always liked HUE products.
B00AYZCTLY|5|Best hose there are, fast shipper, thank you, well packed too!! ;-)
B000XF0XYK|5|Wig fit well, but there was too much white in the wig si I painted more black in it to tone the white down.
B00E48ZVP8|4|Outfit looks just like the photo. My gf loves how she looks in it and so do I! However this is a &#34;spice it up outfit&#34; or for photos. It is not practical to use for restraint or any REAL leash play. If you want something that will hold up for rough play,  you gotta spend some more cash.  But we got what we paid for and I love seeing my girl in this.
B008LENI24|5|High quality.
B002TJNC9Q|5|To be the best, you have to have the best...cufflinks.
B000HCV4ZG|5|These are wonderful shorts!  They're a nice length for doing many types of exercise...not too long, but long enough for adequate coverage.  They are made of a soft material.  I have three pairs of them!
B00E1ALO6E|4|The only thing I didn't love about this dress was the slip underneath. It should be as long as the dress but it's not. It's very short and rode up a lot. Other than that, I and everyone else loved the dress.
B001FOR1JS|2|I bought this belt in December of 2008 and was very happy with it until yesterday, when it fell apart. My usual experience with belts is that they last for years, but the leather on this one disintegrated after only 7 months use. It's a shame, because the belt was nice looking while it lasted.
B000FE98BI|5|Makes me look bigger.
B00H899ZIO|5|&#34;Perfect&#34;
B00MV7C9M2|5|This is an awesome buy! It fits well and looks amazing!  Love it!
B00817ECB2|5|Well instead of a single seven pack I received 2 four packs :) so that was nice
B00BB8V086|1|A very cheap garment and really badly-made, quite big for a 2T size as well.Definitely not an authentic Calvin Klein piece of clothing...very disappointing.
B004QF0TG0|5|These Dri-tech comfort crew socks both look and feel great.there also warm and toasty in the harsh winter weather.I highly recommend buying them.
B008OPAIJG|4|I order this product to surprise my girlfriend. She loves it whenever i wear it. The material is comfortable and fit very well.
B0094VJWWS|3|Very cheaply made and not what i expected but i will make it work! Got less than what i paid for!
B00DTRJIEU|5|It fits me very well.very good stuff·High quality and inexpensive。I hope I can get such a good thing in Amazon later·
B00FN2QMRU|5|Love this workout tank.  The print is very slimming and it makes me look great while working out.  The racerback makes it also comfortable.
B00CKFVNTA|5|I ordered this for my college age daughter and  she absolutely loved it!! I wasn't sure what size to get but she is 5 '9 , I got her the 6 and she said it fits perfect.
B00TQ31B96|4|Nice quality and looks good. Sizing seems very small.
B006NASQ2K|5|These gloves are great for skiing! They are waterproof and provided the warmth needed. I would definitely buy them again.
B00JXX6SSS|5|good
B00OBY81MK|5|Love the quality and print.
B004COFLSQ|2|I just received my Urbane scrub pant in the color steel and noticed a white sticker on the bottom of the right front pant leg.  On closer inspection the sticker was there to mark a white discoloration in the fabric.  The seller did not advertise these as &#34;seconds&#34;.  I normally do not write reviews but I was disappointed upon receiving my order and felt a bit deceived as the pants were not described as possibly having a blemish or &#34;seconds&#34;.  Caution to others who order from Discount Scrubs and Fashions on Amazon Marketplace you may be purchasing unadvertised scrubs with a blemish.
B00LTC1U2K|5|Amazingly good suit at an amazingly great price. This was very high quality and fit just as expected.
B00MYW72GM|5|Fit perfectly. My daughter loved it and has so many compliments when she wears it. Nicely made. Nice quality.
B00CTJW9HW|5|the jacket is looks great and i can't wait for it to get to my house so i can wear it.
B002XZMF80|5|xs adult fit my 10/12 daughter - with a good amount of growing room but it is not baggy.
B0002UCESO|5|Wonderful... wifey loves it!!
B00H40XITY|5|I have always been on the pear shaped side.  I really disliked going to a workout and having my t-shirt ride up and I have to keep pulling it down in back.  You can reach up or down without worrying about it.  Very faltering in my world.  The sizing ran right, and washes beautifully.  I have tried to get one in every color.
B000I2HQGG|1|Really wanted to like this, but the fit was so completely off that i had to return it. ordered a M. I am typically a L but read reviews saying if you want a tighter fit to order size smaller. Well the M i received had armholes that are huge and length of shirt was about double what it should have been. it went half way down my thighs. It's like they took an XL and just reduced the size of tube and none of the length. Weird and useless.
B00HMCEYOC|5|ALL GOOD
B00MUYDKJW|5|warm!
B00B9X4XQO|5|I love the material and it fits good. I plan on buying it in other colors
B000YLUD5C|4|I bought this with another item from this same company.  I was very pleased about this purchase.  I tried them on and they fit great.  I love the pockets on each side.    Ease of movement and I'll be wearing them on the plane for my long trip next month.  In fact they would make great exercise pants too -- better than sweats.   I haven't washed them yet, so that's the reason I only gave a 4 star.  I'll see if they shrink when I wash them.  If they don't shrink,  then I will give them a 5 star.
B00M3HTASQ|5|Good quality and price.
B00JPCX7Y0|5|Really cute.
B004IOXHTU|4|Otherwise you are going to be HOT wearing these.  They are VERY cozy and warm. If the weather outside is frightful, these will be delightful.
B00FC9XCKE|5|WOW!! Awesome fit and, I love love feel of the nylon against my skin, I'm serious thinking about<br />ordering more soon, in other color I couldn't ask for a better fit.
B00CTZ3OZ2|5|Great for little boys ( and their mom's ) who don't know how to tie a tie!  The colors are great and looks real nice w/ his black slacks and blue shirt.
B0051N7XEW|5|I have worn this dress to 2 weddings so far. Great dress true to size, easy to get on and off, wonderful fabric has substance and shape, good design detail in the front. Love the neckline this neckline is hard to find. Wish it came in more colors.
B00KKIJWII|1|Too large
B00DJRMV6M|5|It fit perfect.  It is not thick by any means, it is light weight.  Great quality.  Would order more for light weight wear.
B00D5SEQK4|5|Love this top and it still fits her.  Faded a little but great quality
B002DUCUBM|4|I like these jeans a lot, they could easily become my favorite ones!  The stretch is adequate and accommodates my larger hips!
B00O8DYQXC|5|Very nice outfit my daughter loves it, got it for her birthday and arrived with spare time, thank you
B00891XYGY|5|Perfect black v-neck.  I'm a black v-neck kind of guy and I found these to be much higher quality than the emporio armani ones I purchased previously.  Only thing that annoys me is that they day after I bought them for $32, they went on sale for $24.  Even at full price, this shirt is worth it.
B007ZN52DA|4|Good for price
B00ED7BJLA|4|Great great cardigan.  Very soft, very happy with it.  My only issue with it is the big knit loop snag on everything and there are a few areas that are frayed already.
B00IKMQWFC|5|I am always finding it hard to get the right fit for my scrubs and I must say these are by far the best and most comfortable pants iv bought so far.  Worth every penny!
B003XT6BF8|5|He loved it so much he wore it the day I gave it to him!
B00KE26V3E|3|Delivered on time. Bought this for my sister. The size is a little bit large for her but she still loved the dress.
B000VPG5SA|3|Made of fleece so this was very very hot for my toddler who does a lot of running around.  Did not end up using it for Halloween as he would have passed out in this Texas heat.  He ended up wearing superman pajamas (so one really noticed) with a cape instead.  Would not buy this unless you plan on trick or treating in very cold temperatures. Also, the velcro irritated my son in the back of the neck.
B000PU6YO6|5|Very nice hat. My wife says I look very dapper with it on.
B00CI5FMZI|5|I have lost weight but still have a tummy. I needed shapewear that would help hold my tummy in and this brief does just that!  It is very comfortable and flattering.
B003H1A040|4|I bought these to wear during flare-ups of overactive bladder. They fit as desired, without being overly loose and yet without being snug around the waist. I would not win a style contest in them.
B008SGEKVI|3|I definitely look much slimmer in this suite but as other reviewers stated the under wire in the suite fits lower then is should and the support for a larger bust isn't what it could be.  I feel there should be more layers of fabric or some thin padding in the bust area.  If you are concerned about modesty try another style because this suite had allot of nipple show through that I felt uncomfortable with. It delivers as promised a slimmer appearance but I expected more from a suit at that price point.
B00A9LU514|5|I found a top at a local resale shop and needed a bottom. Grey's Anatomy scrubs are hard to find in brown and tend to be a little pricey. I was glad to find these! They were a great price and arrived quickly. I'll definitely buy again!
B004WPHY1C|5|The costume is absolutely great! It's so darn cute and is SURE to make any person say &#34;awwwww&#34;! It also fit perfectly! It's super warm and pretty much the most perfect costume for a baby/small toddler! My son loved it too and so did anyone that seen him! :D
B00PGLBADE|5|Thank you for he great scarf, price,  and speedy delivery!
B00JFSQ30Y|3|The top fit but the skirt is huge falls right off
B00ANR1OJQ|5|Great sharp graphic runs true to size. My son loves it. Very speedy delivery. Bright vivid colors on shirt so this one's a winner.
B00DAU405I|3|My daughter is short. It does fit nice length wise but arm and leg and hand openings are small and hard to get her hands and feet threw.
B005IU9SDC|5|This is a great motley crue shout at the devil buckle, special for jeans because its a very big buckle
B009DNWH2O|5|The most comfortable, warm, stay in place leggings i have ever had.  They are soft and wash well - highly recommend them.
B00B58H3CE|5|I purchased these pants for my son.  He says the fit is very comfortable, as well as the weight and feel of the fabric. They have been washed twice so far and the color (black) has stayed very dark, with no fading at all. I prefer these to the Lee Custom Fit Collection because the fabric is a bit sturdier. They are also truly no-iron pants. I simply remove them from the dryer at the damp dry signal and hang them to finish drying and they are good to go.
B00D8ST052|2|Ordered these as a gift. When the person opened the packaging the gloves are poorly made and the space between the thumbs on both gloves were unraveling with holes. For the amount of money I paid these gloves should have been better constructed!
B000J3TVPI|3|The picture showed this in red.  The fine print says black.  It's still nice (on my wife) but they should update the picture.  I saw after that they have both black and red, but the picture for both is red.
B00PSWXYSA|5|Beautiful colors...exactly as advertised...perfect fit.
B00GV05RKG|5|These are clearly in Asian women's sizes, but the waist is stretchy and they fit fine.  I normally wear size 0-2 in American brands but I buy size M-L when I am in Asia.  I ordered size L according to the size suggestions, and I am very happy with my purchase.  Putting these in the dryer might be a bad idea though…that could shrink the waistband~
B008GYXQI0|5|This PJ sleeper is absolutely adorable and is well-made.  Footies have rubber marks to help prevent falls.  Would definitely recommend this sleeper to any parent.
B00CC2KIRO|5|a stocking stuffer that was a big hit with the family.  Quality pencils that the boys and my wife love to write with already.
B00ABAKXH4|5|I absolutely adore these. I wanted good thick, warm boot socks, and that's exactly what these are. I tend to have sensitive skin and EVERYTHING makes me itchy, but for some reason these don't bother me at all. They're sooooo warm. My apartment gets pretty warm, and if I accidentally leave them on, my feet will be sweating within an hour. But they're perfect to keep my feet warm at my mom's house, where she keeps it like 62 degrees. ..<br />So, in summary, these are perfect boot socks and slipper socks. I may have to buy more.
B000YQMWMO|5|I have 4 of these bras.  A must-have...so much better than the bras available at Motherhood Maternity.  You could use these for everyday, and at night (I sleep in them sometimes).  They are more supportive than the pretty much useless sleep bras at Motherhood.
B00ANBU0GK|3|I like the fabric design.  overall, I was rather disappointed because I was expecting it to be made of caftan instead of 100% polyester.
B000JHFTUK|4|These fit short.  The width seems to be fine, but the length was shorter than carhartt's I already owned which is strange.  Once I found the right size these are great!
B00D4OKP1I|5|This dress is just fun. Unusual cut, great sparkle, really eye catching.  It is flattering on my body type, I generally wear a 4 or 6 and I am average build, somewhat curvy.  I love the way the 'waist' sits at my hips and how the skirt hangs. The scoop back is sexy too.<br /><br />As for the materials, the entire garment is sequined and the beadwork at the neck, waist, and back are very well done. All sequin/bead work is tightly sewn and consistent  The dress is heavier than I expected because of the embellishments but it still feels great.<br /><br />I couldn't stop grinning after I tried it on, I felt sexy. I went with a 4 I probably could bump to a 6 and the top and skirt would be a bit looser but the 4 worked just fine.
B001WPBA10|5|Bought this for 12 year old daughter. Ordered a medium, but should have gotten small. She can still wear it as an oversized shirt, so it still gets 5 stars. The design is adorable. A monkey playing soccer was just perfect. Decent thickness. Great quality.
B00DBS1NKY|4|nice classic fit. Nothing special about it but fits just right.
B005GPSYLQ|5|This is a pretty nice cardigan for the price.  It is lightweight and goes with a variety of outfits.  It was a little large but I should have know better since Romans is specifically plus size clothing. The quality isn't super but is still good for the price.
B00AA91T5Q|1|Been 30 days since I bought it and it says my delivery should be in another 2 weeks...I was expecting its estimate to be more accurate.... jan 2 has long since passed.
B007UXSXZO|4|These fit well I hope they don't strech out like others do . To the point I fall out of the baskit.
B00DGM5T4Q|3|This jacket is super cozy and super warm. On my short frame, it comes to my knees, so beware if you're short. It tends toward a larger fit, too, so keep that in mind. My main complaint is that when it arrived, the elastic bands holding the buttons of the faux fur collar snapped IMMEDIATELY. As in, I fiddled with them, and they broke. I hadn't even worn it yet. The fur collar wasn't a big enough deal for me to send it back, and I needed a warm coat asap, so I went without the collar. I'll make buttonholes or put in new elastic someday, but if you're not someone who wants to deal with that, then I suggest not buying this coat. It seemed like the elastic was really old, so maybe this coat has been sitting around in a warehouse for quite some time. (It also smelled really funny for a while at first.)
B0006VN9EW|5|I bought this dress in white to use as my informal dress for our evening reception. It is perfect the sizing was right on and it was made so well. Over the next few weeks I will be buying five more for my bridesmaids. The product is great and the price is a bargain.
B004YCUVBS|5|Love them they helps my legs real good
B00ALZ24Y4|5|Exactly what I expected.
B007D4ISH8|5|A little tight on the calves but not too bad.
B00JBW59Q8|4|GOOD QUALITY CLOTHING
B00CJ965IG|5|I bought this for my niece and almost kept it for myself because it's so pretty and soft! It looks exactly as it does on the monitor. Arrived well-packaged and on time.
B00M23CX6C|5|Exactly what we needed, color, fit, style all spot on.
B005TGLE64|5|Lil sebastian shirt &#62; other horse shirts.
B004BFY9K2|4|I am 5'4\\" and 120# and ordered the small. It looks pretty roomy on me, but I started wearing it over my plain light-weight jackets to add flare, and it worked great. The material is nice, the toggle hooks compliment the look, and it added just enough weight to make it warmer.
B00BNEW532|5|I love my new dress from you guys, the fabric is so soft and fit me really well.<br />I bought a size 8 which is my preferred size and was a perfect fit.<br />It is the perfect choice for my sisters wedding in June.
B00GNNWBAU|3|It large as per size info
B004OAHCWQ|5|This dress was exactly what I had expected. I wore this as a bridesmaids dress for my mother's wedding and everyone loved it. The fit is great and it is very comfortable! It has some elastic In the chest part so it is sure to fit anyone nicely. This dress is great because you can wear it for so many different occasions.
B004P2JWVM|4|Sturdy belt,the buckle was a bit stiff to begin with but the more I use it the better and easier it is to use.
B00D5SC9VW|5|great..I like this product, so very god and pretty, comeback shopping again, I recommend at everybody… this indent at photo…
B00FHKKSE6|5|This shirt is awesome! It looks so cute on. Can be worn as a shirt with tight jeans or leggings or as a cute dress. The quality of the material is very high end! Co-workers have asked me to order them one as well. So will be ordering more :)<br />The shipping says it could take quite awhile to receive so I was prepared for a wait and was surprised when it arrived after a week.
B0084AWR2W|5|I am a huge fan of these fleece jackets from Columbia, as I own this very same jacket in several different colors. They always fit just right, they are very warm and comfortable, and I have never had any problems with quality. Now this is just my opinion, but I find these to be every bit as good, if not better, than a comparable product from North Face. I just don't see any reason in spending the extra money on North Face when these jackets that Columbia makes are basically the same. Highly recommend!
B00DPMMB34|5|This is the most comfy costume, EVER!!!  I dressed as a pig for Halloween, and now this will become my lounge-jammies.  I wouldnt want to sleep in it, but its super comfy and roomy for laying around on cold nights.  I am 5'6, 125 lbs and this is baggy on me but not so large I cant wear it.<br /><br />Good quality, fun product.
B002GYW6DM|1|I cannot wear it it does not work, so i would not recommend it to anyone i dont know if i can return it , let me know thanks
B00DNO29PO|5|Great bra. I have this model in the black, cream, and purple shades. The purple is by far my favorite. It's also shiny-but it doesn't shine through your shirts. The design is fairly flat under thin material-but a pattern will mask any bumps that may arise. Nothing spills out and, as a fairly large chested woman, I highly recommend these bras. Top notch. Never had a problem with them. I hand wash them and so far, no under wire issues (the purple is newest, the cream is oldest and still holding up well). I keep giving this 5 stars and buying more. Happy Hunting!
B008MAZIFC|5|I purchased this for my daughter-in-law who is breast-feeding.  She stated that it fit perfectly and is easy to access for breast-feeding.
B008KCX3PE|1|I would not get them again unless you're planning on wearing something over them! You can't wear them for basketball. Not a good fit!
B008QYER42|3|the waist is fine, bought a XL scared because I thought I was a kid (I'm XXL) and it was perfect.<br />The material is very weak, very thin fabric.
B00F9WCT2G|1|i advice to customer to do not buy this product . it is realy too bad, and i regret i bought this product.
B009Z0ANUS|5|I won our work Christmas party ugly sweater contest with this.
B009TB18CK|5|Bought this hat for a trip to Chicago in February. Brr. It covered my ears, kept me warm, looked cute, and didn't mess up/flatten my hair too badly! A+
B00IW8UFMK|5|it fits good on me loved it
B00TYP1RYA|5|I love this suit! The material was comfortable and fitting and the bust had great support. The suit doesn't have the boyshorts look like the picture implies but it's still very cute. The buttons are also a little loose but that's an easy fix. It's perfect for the curvier ladies, very flattering! I got so many compliments! But follow the comments ladies and buy a suit one size larger than usual!
B009A2YIWU|5|I was surprised at the cost of all these headbands and assumed they would be mediocre quality, but I was glad to be wrong. These headbands are super cute and great quality. The picture does them no justice. The centers are very pretty jeweled pieces and the material is perfect. I have seen similar if not exact headbands elsewhere for 3X the amount. I would buy more of these in different styles and from this seller. Shipping was quick.
B002X2F74M|1|I highly recommend NOT buying this bra! When I opened the package, there was a large piece of fishing wire sticking out of the bra. Also, there is nothing on the sides. I don't know if I am missing something or if I am suppose to use something else to wrap it around my back. There is only the velvet that ties around the neck...which does not hold the bra in place. Do not be fooled by the price or picture on the web page. Spend the extra money on something with quality.
B00EI3XMJ6|5|fits well, made very well and no fading after washes, but it has to be like the tag instructs!! Will be buying more from Disney
B00HLRPQZO|4|Great item. Fits perfect and keep face warmer on cold night riding.
B00HH5FONO|5|Great and so comfortable in my body. It's so light and I got great complements when I wore it at the beach resort for Easter brunch family get. together .
B00EG0KTME|5|Love it!!!!!! It SNATCHED my waist and gave me a new figure!!!!
B00ITO0Q8A|5|this dress is not like the pic its even cuter on I love this dress its just perfect for my daughter fit well but its hard to find any shoes to match white deffently dosent go good and black looks awful but if you can find a peach to match.
B003JH8T9A|4|Really cool effect
B000FGX5PG|5|I am very satisfied with everything I have ordered from amazon.
B00PHBWXUM|4|I liked it on my son, and he liked it more than regular Speedo swim shorts. They rise a little sometimes, maybe because the size is a little off...not sure
B00IREZQPA|5|It is for plus size ppl so I am happy.
B00A3G74GO|3|No comment
B00TA3NINO|5|These are &#34;GREAT TENNIS SHORTS &#34; my husband's quote.  He really really likes these.  They fit good, look good and are priced good.
B002US2SH8|5|I purchased these fun socks as a gift for someone who owns both a tan and a black shiba and while it's hard to see in the photo, both colors of dogs are represented. I have owned a couple pair of these socks decorated with another breed, and the fabric is soft, cushy and comfortable with a snug-fit band at the top. They're made well to last - after many wearings/washings over several years, mine show little wear.
B00MNEU66E|3|this jacket actually fit as it should. For the cost it is an OK value.
B00W2Q37DC|4|I really love the t-shirt in itself but they claimed it was a junior size but it really is a child size.  Unfortunately I have to return it, that is why I gave it a 4 star, misrepresentation of the size category.
B00HE4PUPU|5|I like this bra, comfortable and simple.
B00LU0PFY0|5|Very cute, fits perfectly to the size my grandson normally wears.
B00F6PQE9A|1|I've already written two reviews on this jacket and I still was dissatisfied with it.  It is much too small - it definitely<br />is NOT an XL size plus the zipper was broken.  The seller asked me to share the cost of returning it to China!<br />I checked at the PO and it would cost around $70 to return it and $242 via UPS.-- for a $100+ coat!!!!  In my<br />opinion the seller does not represent fairness in the products that are being sold.
B00A38CIR2|4|good quality and decent weight of fabric.  I received this in a timely fashion with no hassel.  This made a good Christmas present.
B00CM0955C|5|we both really like these sunglasses!
B00HAX5A8W|5|Good quality and does not shrink from washing and air drying.
B00DM2HNJE|5|This is a great dress for wearing to work. The cut is flattering & it's easily accessorized. I'd like this dress in more colors.
B00X82QUHY|5|It was a perfect fit and kept me very warm as i robbed banks and looted liquor stores with ease. With the other masks i used i would find my self constantly fixing or messing with my mask while holding up a bank at gun point, but none of those problems occurred with this product!
B000HKMQUK|5|Great product.
B000CRKHH2|3|I WAS JUST A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT. DID NOT LIKE VERY MUCH. FOR ME THEY WERE JUST OK.
B00NNECJ9K|5|A purchase you will not regret! Practically long enough for anyone taller than 5'5 as well. It is what it is. It had no flaws when i received it.
B004I3ZYA6|5|This socks were a hit.  He states they are comfortable and warm.  The socks fits very well and stays up.
B00OH4OHX6|4|Somewhat small
B003PC2GQ6|5|Shirt looks great. Material is not too thin. Just right for me. I have received many complementary remarks. It is a snug fit so buyer should take that into consideration.
B007MS2N8K|3|This was a HUGE fitting XL. I looked like an awkward 13 year old with body issues while wearing it.
B004OWMY0Y|1|I have some Van Heusen shirts that I love, but they are getting so raggedy that the wife said they had to go. She hunted everywhere for them and then declared them to be no longer made out of cotton, but unobtanium. Anyway, when I saw these I was delighted. When i got them and tried them on I realized they were hardly the same shirts. Very thin and cheaply made. I returned them--and they were taken back with no issue.
B0012N38XA|5|Fits perfectly, always love this Bali bra. I buy both 34DD and 32 DD based both are awesome. Perfect for daily use.
B00N4N6RMU|1|Short!!
B008ZBPSAS|5|Stock is sold out on this one... if you are sitting on slippers size too small in 11/12 or 13/14, add a comment... I'm a 9/10 and looking.
B006F46GH6|5|I used this at a Hollywood themed event and it was fun to wear.  A bit itchy at times, but it is feathers and I expected that.
B005GW6T66|5|Perfect for me. I'm 5'3 and 140 lbs. I love the tunic length.
B007O3TLLU|5|i love it so beautiful fits good color on the dress very nice over all very beautiful costume and i love it
B00BQ9S1MI|5|It was Great..exactly what I wanted and expected..I was very happy with my project and so was the little girl that I bought it for
B00EONSFGA|1|The jacket not only feels like paper, it does not look like it is on the picture. It is such a strange material. I am very unhappy
B00CBAOBEI|5|Love this shirt--replacing all my Under Armor with Carhartt.  This shirt is thicker and warmer than my Under Armor thermal shirts.  It has a dense waffle pattern, and is very wind resistant.  It is thicker and heavier than cheaper Haynes or Fruit Of The Loom thermal shirts too--it's like standard thermal waffle pattern underwear with a tighter weave and twice as thick.<br /><br />The main reason I like it more than Under Armor is that 1) the sleeves are extra long and 2) the shirt length is extra long.  One can actually tuck this shirt into their pants and have it stay there if they're outside doing some manly, rugged activity--stacking wood or building a snowman with a 4 yr old.  Likewise, the sleeves can get tucked into gloves, etc and they stay there.  My Under Armor shirts, as much as I liked them, would always have the sleeves and waist line ride up and get un-tucked.  This was caused due to too-short length, as well as the &#34;shiny&#34; or &#34;slippery&#34; Under Armor material, which might be great for wearing under football pads, but its not so great trying to keep it tucked into a pair of jeans.  The Carhartt shirt is nice and long and actually grips a pair of pants and stays tucked in.<br /><br />So much better than UA stuff at a comparable price.  Love it, love, it love it!
B00C2BPAD2|2|Wow. Just got these in today. Not a good buy. The pants are see through and made of some crappy material. I thought I was getting a good deal on these on sale. Boy was I wrong. I would not recommend getting these. Shop at express, much better quality. Lets hope Guess lets me get a full refund...
B0034JVOMC|1|I would not waste my money.  They didnt stay up and when walking around the house they kept coming of almost. They went in the garbage in one month
B00CI07X6Y|1|The quality of the material is poor. it can be seen through. Shape isn't good. the worse part is it couldn't been returned
B00UKY3SLE|5|I luv them!!!
B0081RPELO|4|Good material  and construction
B00LQEJ50A|5|Wife love it for her work outs... That's all that matters.
B00NOFWDOY|5|great shorts!
B00OCNMERI|5|smooth, simple and stylish
B0031U0PQA|5|The belt is great! Just what I needed. Perfect fit for Dickies work pant loops and strong. Happy with it.
B00AB0AX4C|4|Nice small wallet
B00MAVTRGA|5|It's great!
B00KPOXIV4|5|😁
B00JR129U2|5|my daughter loves this shirt
B007KG487I|4|Very nice.  Comfortable.  Fit will.
B00CL0Y3T6|4|I got these yesterday and sad to say they are way too small for me!  I ordered the small but I think even if I had ordered the medium I would be returning them as they are just too short!  I am a size 4 yet these are truly made for very thin frames & much younger girls!  Besides the small sizing they are adorable!  I would highly recommend, the colors are bright and they seem to be well made.  I have bought from this company before & I am very happy with their clothes!  I will be coming back!
B00CWNB7RS|5|I was looking for fingerless gloves and these are just beautiful Just as you see them.  a nice soft knitted feel on your hands.
B00865EFP2|2|Guess I will have to try and loose some of that extra weight.  Usually this size would fit me and I love the comfort for the tennis courts.  This hugs the middle way too much
B00AMYTGRM|2|Not at all as pictured or described
B00SUHA7VC|5|very fluffy and full
B00ARDD99O|5|Every store in our local area were selling these items for far more than Amazon. We purchased them for our son and was extremely happy in the quality Gerber places into their products. These have held up very well to the many amounts of &#34;drool&#34; our son has thrown their way…
B008REWJ5K|4|Will have to wait to use it on my 8 month old neice but very pretty and stylish. Would be great if it came in more colors.
B000OWDSQ2|5|I bought this in the store and love love love the bra. Shape, support and style. Why champion would quit making  a bra that got this many rave reviews is beyond. I you are someone who tried and loved this bra, join forces with me and go to champion's website and petition them to bring it back. Maybe the will if they hear from enough of us.
B0079VKZLC|5|Fits as expected (and I often have trouble with bra fit), nice fabric that stays put -- made &#34;the girls&#34; look great!
B0085IC2XW|3|If you don't like your shorts to cover your knees, than buy a size down.  Other than that they are a good value.  They are very light weight and breathable.
B00B7N8M6S|4|Great product overall, I was hoping the lettering would be bigger on the shirt, but it was very crisp and clean when we got it and the fabric is soft.
B00109US84|5|I love this dress, I used it for my boyfriends military ball.  We live in different states so I had to fold it in half just to get it on the plane as carry on.  It unfolded beautifully, I just placed it in the bathroom while the shower ran hot to steam the few wrinkles out.  It wore amazingly, altho I did have to alterd because I had read that the sizes ran a bit small, I could have stayed with my own size, but  because It is so afforable It worked out well that I bought it and had to trailed to me. I kept this dress in case my sister wants to wear it to her prom or the next military ball. I got it in the dark burgendy color. Very happy with this purcase, I didnt wear the \\"shaw\\" thing.
B00RDQXIKI|4|Only negative thing is that the tag is on the hot pink side and looks a little tacky when wearing it that way. Otherwise, I love the button function on the chin strap. Very practical and good material.
B00PQDJ1YW|4|Cute
B00GIH0WZC|3|I got it quickly more than I expect.
B00N4CLVDQ|4|Breathable!
B000UZRCVU|4|This bra is pretty great, especially considering I didn't try it on ahead of time. The straps are comfy, no problems with fit. I've had a time or two where my headlights showed through, but that's my only complaint.
B004YZ848W|4|These fit great and are comfortable. Hold up to the life style of a pre-schooler and the extra washings. 1
B00BPJKCL2|5|I love this scarf! If you don't have sensitive skin this will be a great scarf. The material can be a little itchy but it doesn't bother me.
B00GD0OLHO|1|I wore this dress only once and it ripped at two seams.  I promise it's not based on my size - it's just based on the quality of the dress and the material.  That's $80 down the drain!
B00B7KJT1I|5|Looks and fits great. If you are a programmer, you will definitely appreciate it. You will be a hit around the office :)
B00N3OVQSK|5|comfy
B00PJAWGTE|3|Pants were returned.  They were too long.
B00O6TG9A6|2|Not 100% cotton quality
B00JFSC6OQ|5|It is an excellent product. Soft and smooth feeling. Well design and fit. got to recommend it.  Will but it gain.
B008ASJNQQ|5|I bought this outfit for my new niece for her first Christmas. It was as beautiful in person as it was in the picture. My sister loved it as well, which is a bonus since we tend to have different styles! The material isn't winter-warm, so be sure to layer it with a onesie if it's cold out.
B000VK2C8W|2|Hideous! Women in your 20s beware this bra will age you! It's coney and old fashioned. Very supportive though so I sometimes wear it under a regular sports bra.
B00IE0ZHBU|4|I purchased this blouse a little hesitant based on reviews I had read but I am pleased with it.  I ordered an XL, and it fit as expected.  If I wanted it to look as it shows on the model, I would have ordered it XXL.  I am 5'5'' and 190lbs, size 14 pants, L-XL tops.  The material is fine contrary to some comments stating as it being &#34;cheap looking.&#34;  I can't wait to put it on with jeans or leggings which is long enough to cover the back.  I am very pleased with it.
B00G2JGVK6|5|I love this sash its a perfect way to celebrate a girls 21st birthday!! I know I enjoyed wearing it.
B00CF3VWAM|3|The shirt design is very good but the only problem I had was that it was a bit thin so you could see the T-Rex through the shirt somewhat
B006QTZD6A|3|Runs somewhat large. I bought the outfit for the shorts and the top was a cute bonus. The picture doesn't show that the shorts are stitched in red so it didn't go with the shirts I planned on. You must pay to ship back the item so I just kept it and hope it fits next spring. Item came in super fast!
B004WSPYPC|2|runs a little small....had I known, I would have order the next larger size
B00HESUF9M|3|Look and feel very plastic like which is not really what I was hoping for, but they are ok quality aside from that.
B00UJ82UVK|5|Love this ! I have had so many compliment s.
B00A8HVBTE|5|I like the style of the levi cargo shorts! Fit's very well & also comes with a belt. The length is just right for me excellent!!!
B00EPODUYA|4|I bought these to tuck away in my on-board bag, and I 'm glad I did. They take up very little space,  are comfortable on long flights and are nice to wear in your hotel room as well. Cheap too!
B001DMJ4EW|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Shipped fast.
B00ILESX92|5|The fit is nice, and this is well made.
B00O23R97I|5|Fit is great: room to move, bend and stretch. Fabric is very soft and light.
B00A3I5BKS|4|These shorts fit well.  They have cargo pockets but arent baggy or sloppy looking.  Very simple, basic shorts.
B00QA1XZ6O|5|Fit perfect
B005OLB3YW|3|My daughter is 2 years old and not even 35&#34; and this robe comes up above her knees. Not really what we were looking for, but it functions OK.
B00I61HUT4|3|This shirt has a beautiful design.  Unfortunately, the fit is very boxy. The 3/4 sleeve makes it more so.  This could look elegant.  I'm keeping it because of the design but I'm having the tailor make it into a short sleeve shirt and fitted.  Too bad it shows long sleeves with a beautiful print down the sleeve but it only is in a 3/4 sleeve. Not sure what that is about.
B00FW8880E|5|I love these!  They fit perfect.  Decided to buy more and now they don't have what I want.  HINT:::If they have want you want, stock up!!
B00QHTCOUW|5|Fits perfectly.
B00JV535CA|1|Returned item, super small!
B008J8N0P2|5|I recently purchased this item to wear after a medical procedure. I needed something that would offer support, but I was also looking for comfort. I found this athletic jock strap to be both comfortable and supportive. This athletic support is well made and fells very durable. I have washed it several times and since worn it for a variety of sports exercises. Having worn this product and realizing the support I gained, I couldn't imagine doing any extremely physical activities without one.<br /><br />The material do very well in the washer. They have not faded or shrunk at all. This athletic support looks the same today as it did a few months ago when i bought it.
B00719WWCW|5|This is a great product, similar to sweat pants but lighter, just right for early on a day that's going to be warm.
B00M3FZQ18|4|Could be a good purchase when quantity is needed, but do not count on the stripe colors being as shown since ours were not.  Our group had three pulls.  Two (on the same cap) were large enough to need being pulled inside the cap through the weave and knotted.  The weight is light for a knit cap but the fit is comfy.  It might sound smaltzy but during bad snow storms we often notice that members of the condo snow clearing crew lack hats or gloves, so when we can get an affordable purchase of either, or of jerky we get those to hand out if needed.  This also could be a handy purchase for a group or large family, or for teens who tend to lose their hats.
B00AMCNO3Q|4|its a bit shiny in that fake leather kind of way, but it fits great, looks good and it took 10 days to get to me.
B00DEP2FXS|5|My 2 year-old loves this owl dress. It is just like the picture and is made out of great quality materials. Love it.
B00NVUY34U|5|This is my fav pair of legging. They are so comfortable.
B002R0F7Q8|5|I bought for my 5 year old girl to put over her leotard.  Fits great, well made, washes well.  Will probably buy more.
B00IVLMS6O|4|just got mine in today a day early. really happy with it. just make sure you measure your chest and waist before deciding on a size. i normally buy large. after measuring my chest and waist i got the X-L and it fits perfectly. only reason why i gave it a 4 star and not a 5 is because i felt like i wanted it a little longer. other then that very good.
B009PI8GD6|4|These are very nice gloves.  Keep my hands warm up here in snowy Vermont.  The only complaint is that they are a little small and tight.  Hopefully they will stretch with age.
B004ZI5AV2|5|Looked great
B00CLYY2D4|5|LOVE IT
B00FCV8AR2|3|Looks cool and whatnot. But it shrunk in the wash the first time even though it says it's preshrunk. Kind of a shame.
B007EKOX2A|5|warm & Comfortable
B007FDMXOG|4|Teh only downside is they're a little long for someone 5' 3&#34; but I'll adjust
B00BZP1O9U|5|I have no Idea why people are so dissatisfied with this sweater. This sweater shipped and arrived at my house (Iowa) fast as f*ck. It was about 14 days early. Im not sure what other people got, but I got exactly whats in the picture. I am about 5'8'' and weigh around 135 pounds, so I am more on the skinny side. I ordered the medium slim and it fit perfectly. The sleeves are a bit short, but not like what other peole say. The sleeves are about 23 inches and cover my arms, including my wrists. The material feels a little like typical under armour sweaters, but not quite. It has a decent thickness as well. The inside is very soft. The buttons are plastic, but thats really not a problem. The pockets are actually pretty small. I can barely fit my hands inside them. The zipper itself is metal, but the teeth are plastic.The collar is really soft because it is lined with a (fake) fur which feels really nice. The collar is not very tall, reaching only half of my neck. Another thing is the hood. It is virutually unwearable unless you have a shrunken head. Im serious. It goes over my head, but it is pretty tight, and it has a pointy tip, so I would not wear it in the ghetto if you buy a white one. If you really want a functinal hood, just wear a thin hoodie underneath it. Im not sure if it will shrink in the dryer or not because I have not washed it. Overall I think this is a good product. It has its faults, no doubt, but it only cost me around 12 bucks, so it wasnt bad at all. F*ck her right in the pussy.
B00HZLQD3U|4|Runs a bit small , the material is a bit weird but its a nice sweater overall.
B007M608OS|5|This is way better than any other 511 I've tried on.<br /><br />I'm 5'5. 138 lbs with skinny calves. This fits me like a decent pair of jeans without being to tight or too loose. They are still a bit long at 30x30 but thats understandable and easily fixed with cuffs. The waterless rinse is also quite amazing.<br /><br />Amazon is the best! Will always revisit.
B00GUE6HVQ|2|Not as nice quality or fit as the Tommy Bahama Half-Zip Style number T21726 which my husband bought in November at a retail store while we were on vacation in Sanibel. It is 100% cotton and has very similar styling - the same set-in shoulders, the same half-zip, the same U-shaped back panel. But it fits completely differently. It is a much slimmer cut and thus more fitted. That made it look too tight on him and pulled uncomfortably on his neck, so I am returning it. Moreover, the fabric in this one is just not as nice.<br /><br />He is very disappointed because he practically lives in the other one and I cannot find it anywhere online.
B0031U0PQA|5|I tend to wear belts out like nobody's business. However, I have yet to do so with the 2 I have. It's an awesome belt. Just order it the same size as your pants and you'll be fine.
B006GF7HGS|4|These jeans look good and feel good. I have no doubt they are stylish and quality made. However, they didnt fit my body size correctly. Ordered a size 10. The butt and hips are very generous on these jeans plus they have stretch in them so I would say get atleast a size smaller. I am 5'4 and they looked like mom jeans on me.
B00F1GNPMI|1|Cause I liked but is too small for be a large, then I try to change for another size, but you guys don't let me do it
B000QWDQVC|4|I would recommend this product to anyone looking to cinch there waist and get rid of the bulge in the waist and tummy.  It instantly slims your mid section and gives your breasts a lift.  I have gotten so many compliments.
B00MTUY9GK|5|Cute as can be!
B00LGRWDB0|5|I'm a fairly small woman so I'm normally a mens size small. But since some reviews said order a size larger i did. I ordered a medium and it's absolutely perfect! The material is so warm and soft. And fits my body type lovely.
B00HHOG0B0|1|I felt it was a little to cheaply and did not like how it fit!  Need to make better choices next time!
B00FF7ON6A|4|It was a good product, fits snug, looks great and is reasonably priced. Only thing is its a little longer/past the waist, takes a while for it to get to you cus it ships from hong kong or something, and mite shrink a little when washed.
B00MMOF7W8|5|My husband first purchased this shirt in a Large, his normal size for T-shirts.  It was too small.  So, this XL is more like a man's L.  He loves it and gets so many comments on the shirt!  It's easy to spot other Harry Potter fans by whether they get this or not.
B00KEAQ2Q2|5|My Dads birthday was recently and I was wondering what to get a 61 year old man who has everything. I typed in birthday gift for dad and poof #1 on the list. I chuckled for a good 15 mins thinking about the way it would look on him. I was, however nervous to see if he would even think its funny. Well my friends I am glad to say he has a winning sense of humor. He wore it the next day said it was super comfy. I got him a xxxl because he is a tall stocky guy(6'4). A little big but nothing the wash cant fix. Only con is he wont take it off when company is at the house. O'well.
B000FXXW9I|5|Fast shipping and came as described. Bought for my uncle who works outside and needed overalls without the extras insulation. Have already ordered extra for him.
B00P8EY8PQ|3|I Order a L size and it is pretty big!!! (I'm 1.80 meters) I can't return it because I'm in Costa Rica, so now I need to fix it here. However nice style and quality!
B00CA5NII4|1|I ordered the rolling backpack so that I didn't have to carry in on my back but after a little while the strips started to come off. In my school we can't  roll backpacks because of an incident but we can outside of school.
B00LUMCCJ4|5|Love the way they fit the hubby
B004LIYYMW|3|Pretty much got this purse to meet the &#34;free shipping&#34; cost, but its cute. Didn't have high expectations, but man this is one stiff little purse. I don't imagine much flexibility at all with this thing, or its ability to hold some serious weight (seems too thin/weak). As others have said the zipper doesn't really close either. So far pretty good, but I just keep receipts in it so. yeah.... :D
B00EAU4GVA|4|It's Sharknado, need I say more?
B00ESFDVFE|5|Love this bra!
B005VEMM4C|1|I thought this was a sure win of a purchase because all the reviews gave it five stars. What I got looked totally different from the pic that was up at the time. I had ordered another beret from Sakkas as well, which was also a disappointment.
B00BPFKJIC|4|They are cute and what I was looking for, but they started to unravel after 2 wears. If they hadn't of done that so soon, I would of rated them 5/5 stars.
B00JUMARD4|4|Very nice but too small. Had to give it away. Size L seems to be M.
B00K00TWJA|5|I absolutely love it and fits great.very comfortable .was kinda leary after Reading the review yet im glad i decided to see For Myself. very nice no fade.its better than the reviews i read.glad i bought.and would recommend it.i have a belly and it does not show with this blouse.
B00ESFYMHK|5|Great
B00EQCF4AY|4|Love the top and the way it fits... the &#34;buttons&#34; on the front of the shirt I have to admit I'm a little disappointed with.  I've had 3 of them fall off and I'm definitely not hard on my clothes. They are more like a cover with a clear dot under them.  The clear stayed on but the gold/brass/turquoise cover fell off.  For the price I paid I'm not complaining and the top still looks very nice.
B000WUKN8M|1|The fabric was so thin that you could see COMPLETELY through it!
B00C6FNZIG|5|They are real good quality sunglasses - and fit me perfectly.  Worth every penny! I highly recommend to anyone who wants a real nice, quality pair of aviator sunglasses.
B0009I2HZ4|5|This fits very snug, so plan accordingly when you order. I first tried one on at David's Bridal with my gown, and then ordered this on Amazon (much cheaper).
B00E8ODDNU|1|I got them, put them on, and realized there were holes along the inner seam.
B005BW9TMM|5|I bought this mask to wear at our school's Halloween carnival. It worked out great...scary yet didn't make my face sweaty or leave marks on my skin. Also the headband was not uncomfortable at all.
B00GTNCW3K|5|Excellent price my son loved them
B00Q2OVTL2|5|Very cute
B001UHMZN2|2|I wear a 34 but with these i need a 36
B00BONNO14|3|Beautiful colors I loved it
B00BBWBH76|5|Perfect color for a Minion costume.
B002ST1CIU|5|It is hard to find bras this size that actually fit a woman.  This one needs to be hand washed, as it may lose its shape.
B003D08W90|4|My first pair of thong underwear.  I wasn't quite sure about this when I decided to try a pair. (was tired of creeper underwear).  I really like these things.  All day comfort and no creep.  (it's already there) and no uncomfortable movement.
B00JTQFKR4|2|Totally see through material. These are definitely leggings and not workout material.
B0052I2RKQ|2|I was incredibly disappointed on these pants, although i found them in the jeans sections, they turned out not to be jeans at all, but some weird material, not leggings either, could be described as stretchy pants or maternity pants basically. It was not what I was expecting at all and i wouldn't have wasted money in these if I had known they weren't jeans. BE WARNED these are not JEANS, and I doubt they are real True Religion at all.
B00PGIF182|5|The regular old belt reengineered - who would ever think that is a great idea? Well turns out that it's a darn good idea.<br /><br />The Trakline starts with a really nice full grain leather belt - the width and style that I would easily pay $25-50 in a department store. A nice belt - not high fashion awesome belt - a really good serviceable belt.<br /><br />Then they add this funky ratchet track to the back of the belt. OK, that's kind of cool, and totally invisible. And they have a choice of a few different basic belt buckles - no WWF or boxing championship buckles here, just normal nice looking buckles.<br /><br />And they make this thing really easy to cut down to the size you really need.<br /><br />As a regular old average belt, this one is well worth the price of admission, even if it had buckle holes in it like any other.<br /><br />That ratchet thing really changes everything. The buckle has a ratchet inside - actually it is almost exactly the same concept as a zip tie. Zip ties, you know the plastic things you use to bind wires together, they make a funny clicking noise as you pull them and then hold tight. Same thing here, except on a bigger scale and they have a nice release to you don't have to cut yourself out of the belt like a zip tie.<br /><br />In practice this belt is super nice and easy to use. Push the end through the buckle until it starts clicking and the belt has gone through the first belt loop on your pants. Then pull the end of the belt to tighten the belt - maybe center the buckle as you do that. Pull really hard, and your pants will never fall down and you'll feel snug all day. Pull a little bit to snug the belt up, and you've got room to move around. The key, you figure out how tight you want your belt every time you pull the belt.<br /><br />Once you've set the tightness, it doesn't change.<br /><br />Now you want your pants down - don't ask, don't tell - press the little lever with your index finger (the lever is a button on the lower right side of the buckle) and the belt will loosen. Sometimes you have to push the belt together a little bit to release the ratchet, especially if you tightened the belt a lot or you ate a lot of food or drank a lot of beer. Here's the downside, nobody else will know how to take off your belt. So you are always on your own to do that until the other person figures out the secret button. Although I guess it could be a conversation starter, hey how do you undo this belt? Let me show you. And when you're standing in the stall - the guy next to you can hear you ratchet your belt on. It does make some clicking noise. Hey dude what was that clicking noise? I'm not a big fan of bathroom talk, so I kind of like being a little more stealth in those situations.<br /><br />The big bonus with this belt - it is so adjustable. When they say this normal version goes up to 44 inch waist, they mean it. There is plenty of belt for a guy that wears a 44 inch waist pants. I'm a 42 and there was tons of extra belt for me. No need to go the XL route.<br /><br />Oh, the buckle is never coming off the belt accidently. There is this massive jaws clamp with huge teeth that dig into the leather of the belt. Premade belts are held together this well. When you want to trim down the belt, it is super easy to cut with a pair of scissors or a knife at the correct length. Cut a little long at first to be certain you get it right. You can always cut off a little more if the end tab is still too long. You can't put material back if the belt is too short.<br /><br />For all these reasons, I love this belt. The only situation I can imagine where this belt wouldn't work great is if you really enjoy having other people open your belt for you, and you don't like making clicking sounds in the bathroom, or gym, or locker room, or other places you put on your pants.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.right side of the buckle) and the belt will loosen.

B00BPXKAE2|4|The Extra-large Tee-shirt fits as expected. However, I have not worn it anywhere and have not washed it yet.<br />How it fits after being washed and dried will prove the size.
B002XV456Y|4|So comfy.
B00THP5036|5|Soft fabric. Fit nicely
B00HJKU3WE|4|very well
B00M8U08CK|5|This sleep sack is lined with sherpa fleece (the fuzzy stuff) and it's wonderfully warm and comfy.  Our child loves it and I feel good knowing she's sleeping in a product that has no chemical flame retardants (wool is naturally flame resistant), is warm, very well constructed, and comfy.  It's expensive, but we used the smaller sack for two years (washing it on a regular basis) and it held up beautifully.  We expect to get the same life out of this one.
B000JHFV0S|5|Fit as advertised. Sturdy construction. Deep rich color. Comfortable. Great price.
B009CCRK8C|2|I bought these socks because of the recommendations here. I have diabetes and keeping my feet warm is a problem. I buy Carhart and other brands as well. These fit nicely, they keep my feet warm, BUT.... The heels wear out on these faster not only then any other wool socks I own, but faster than basic tube socks as well.<br /><br />Because of that I would suggest you spend a little more and get a different brand. I could never suggest this to anyone I know.
B000QGBUTI|1|poor quality.. this brand went offshore  (can you say CHINA?)  this brand is garbage...
B00R79ZRF0|5|Very good case, it came super early, fits my iPhone 5c. Love everything about it.
B00QZJESJ4|1|to big
B002DN11PK|3|I've been purchasing French Toast pants for my  boys for the last 13 years.  I noticed the quality has gone down.  these pants came out of the first wash and were already showing some pilling.  that leaves me very disappointed.<br />I also paid for 2 day shipping from cookies kids and they took 4 business days to get here.
B00ESKZNY6|5|I am 26, 5'6&#34;, size 24 or XS, and skinny. These shorts in a zero fit me well. I have long legs and they don't look too short or skimpy at all. I think the amount of distress is perfect, and the material is good quality denim. I would recommend these shorts. They do stretch a bit.
B00427D54K|4|its not navy, its more of a royal blue to violet. Has more of a feminine look than I thought, My husband didn't like the color but I love it and its a really nice bag for the money otherwise. I really like it!
B004CO4CMW|5|I bought a small for my six-year-old to wear under a rather see-through uniform blouse.  Not only does this do the trick, but she loves it!  She started wearing it for a night shirt.  The fabric is not see-through, and the straps are not as short as they look in the picture.  I notice they stay up just fine, too.  When she outgrows these, we'll get the next size up.
B00W8561GC|5|It is awesome, shapes my stomach daily. Sometimes I put it on one hour before wearing that perfect drss and it does the trip! its super cool and sheds inches due to the body constantly sweating under there. It tough, I love it
B00KCJLXJG|3|Delivery and packaging good, tight fit, need to have thin shoulders and thin waist or your need a larger size.
B00BQNXIZ4|5|My daughter received this backpack for her 5th birthday, she's going to be 7 in a few days. Its held up superbly! There are a few small holes on the bottom of the bag from her dragging it around, but overall this bag has been a great investment!
B00EFT9C60|2|Top looks nothing like the pic, the shoulders a fluffy, and the top is short not long.and im 5&#34;3 and its still short.<br />thought it was gonna go to my knees, guess not.
B00JQRS1OA|4|Great!
B00PEK47Y6|5|Looks good, got xl
B00S1S6X9U|5|I love this skert
B00HA49ZY6|5|Silver jeans are super comfy and cute. These are great.
B00LT9MSLK|5|I received many compliments on this bag.  Everyone especially liked the bamboo face to give a classic black bag a summer look.  It is very roomy and can accommodate items I would normally have to put in a tote. I work downtown and have a long walk from the parking lot to the office.  The less bags I have to carry the better and this works well.  The price has been estimated at twice what I paid for it.
B005JSZEN6|5|These were gifts and the recipients loved them. My friends smiled when they opened the gifts. Wishes I had got some for myself.
B00MQAV43O|5|Its a very good wallet. The texture is just perfect and as u can see theres a lot of space for cards
B002GHC2W4|5|Really like the jacket.  fits perfect.
B003F7D3KY|5|i look great in them
B00HRU282E|3|Cute shirt but you can see through it so you have to wear another shirt underneath. Also, annoying that the rhinestones are always falling off!
B00M2RAXJW|1|yah a 5x is so small that it fits my sister that is only a size 8 in lady
B00DB8ELW6|5|I am always looking for a slim belt as many of the pants and short I wear have small belt loops. I may find them in the store but my size is sold out as it seems my size is quite popular. I love this one. Unfortunately other colors were not available in my size.<br />Later date: I like this belt so much that I purchased another one. The first was in orange and this one was in red. Again my size must be very popular as certain colors were unavailable in my size. Oh well, no one sees them except me and I love them.
B00KMV46PC|5|Good construction, fits well, and has a great tactical look.
B00EZ8KC3S|5|So I was 100% excited when these pants showed up with the top (from the subject) and found that they matched EXACTLY.  They were for a costume, but I would probably wear them around the house.  They were thick enough to wear as pants, but not hot and sweaty.
B00817DZWO|4|Good Buy, for the budget conscious.
B00L3OR5MS|4|Really cute simple black dress. This is VERY casual though, so if you're looking for a LBD this is not it.<br />It's very comfortable and fits true to size. Thin material so it's not too hot in summer. Kind of see-through, so you might want to wear a slip or at least black panties. But it was a staple of my closet this summer, and I paired it with tights and cardigans into the fall time. It's so simple, so it was fun to accessorize with different belts, jewelry, etc.
B005LCBN7G|5|I wear this jacket as a layer when I'm running, and it is a great windbreaker and insulates me somewhat from the cold.  It is long enough for me (I'm 5'1&#34;) to cover my backside, which I want to do when I'm wearing leggings for running.  Nice large zipped pockets for a few valuables.
B00R0PHKBA|5|Jacket was received on time, and it was a perfect fit and looks well made. The zipper pull seems to be made for left handers and its made of plastic. I was hoping for a metal zipper, but I guess one can't have everything.
B00DRB94BK|5|A1
B00CC6ZQHW|5|Totally cute but a bit big
B001P3OVPQ|5|Love the way this jeans fit. Still has the lower belly fat from c-section and this mask it very well.
B00LNK4QKG|4|The reviews talked about how super small the shirt ran. I ordered two sizes up and it was too big. I would order one size up.
B0048MEJDU|4|This belt is modeled after a tactical rigging belt and comes close to being as effective. In fact for every day use, it might even be better than the real thing. The double-thickness makes the belt useful for more than just fashion. Here is the quick break down:<br /><br />Pros:<br />** Infinitely adjustable, plus a little added velcro.<br />** Stiff enough to use with a pistol holster.<br />** Price is about right.<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Like most of Bison belts... SHARP EDGES that require added filing.<br /><br />I like this belt... it's a useful piece of every day gear. Choose this model over the light-duty model. Far better.
B00C20E4JE|4|These fit perfectly in the crotch area. My only issue is the leg straps are a little loose. I do not have small legs either. They did tighten up a little after several washings. All in all though very comfortable and supportive enough. good for everyday wear.
B002H0O3D6|5|This came really quickly in the mail exactly like the picture I love it
B00FBNPLEQ|5|Nice
B00C4RQYV6|5|this t shirt is great i would'nt mind buying another one
B006PGDAUK|5|These trucks are awesome!!
B006HY2HY0|5|it's wonderful
B00542WSTU|4|I ordered a L and XL for my two boys. The L is a 14/16 in this brand and yet fits him just like a 10/12 would (glad I ordered up a size!) the XL is an 18 and fits like a 14/16.  So it's a fabulous sweater and looks great but runs a little small.
B00JBXOP80|3|It´s so so, but it´s ok, right.
B00OTYC6FA|5|compliments started coming immediately. 1st class service
B0007CKQKK|5|Jeans were for son who has had 95 lb. weight loss this last year. He loves the fit! Would recommend the brand.
B00DPHFVM2|5|Soft and hold up well. Got one size larger so they weren't so tight.  Have bought multiple pairs because they are so great.
B00CGA4G1G|2|I ordered 2 shirts....1 royal blue and  1 navy blue but  when they  came they were both royal blue.I decided not to send one back to try and get a navy  blue one because it seemed like it would be more of a hassle.The navy blue one was to be for my husband,mine the royal blue.I have washed mine before wearing and wore it one time and it seems that the letters are coming off already.I ended up paying about $50.00 for the two of them and yes I know some of that was supposed to go to charity.I just would have thought for the price the quality would be a bit better and the order would have been checked a couple times before sending it out.Thank You,your not so happy customer
B0045XKV5C|3|I gave this to my friend for christmas, shes a huge vamp diaries fan, she loves it and she got a lot of compliments on it. it looks like a vintage piece of jewelry
B00HY89OOO|5|Good
B00DAW88Q8|5|I love it
B00ER09VBI|5|Love it.
B008VEVX80|5|Love this warm up. It is so luxurious feeling! Definitely recommend.
B00OZPHKR2|5|Very good in look. I'm 178cm and 170lbs, Medium fits well.<br />The only problem is that the shirt get wrinkled easily.
B00K35JKV2|5|Love it ! He loved it ! -Great Fathers day gift for the Hunter!
B00B6EDDBC|3|The 2X is not a 2X it is an xxl.
B000KLV1U2|3|Waist too high....  what happened to the low cut slim boot cut stretch Wrangler???????????
B0029XFO9I|2|I bought a pair of these back in September of 2010 and I've only worn them once.  I was disappointed with them already when I first pulled them out of the packaging. They aren't white - they are off-white, sort of tan or cream colored. I was hoping for something that would replace my white, cotton GoldToe socks but these are not a good replacement if you prefer white.   My other, perhaps bigger complaint is that they are not very soft... they are actually quite itchy. I don't have this problem with any of my other wool socks which I purchased from two different leading suppliers of wool socks.  These socks do look well made although I haven't worn and washed them enough to know how well they would last. I'm giving them two stars because I was very disappointed with how itchy they are and with the fact that they are actually off-white, not white as advertised.
B00AOMYF3M|1|Pants were too small and too short<br />I wasn't impresed with the material as the pants felt very stiff
B00A8DLKQW|3|Nice runs one size smaller
B001AERQZ2|4|This is a nice hat at a good price.  The sizing is spot on, so know your size when ordering.  This is not a heavy, thick and stiff style felt hat, it is a little lighter material.  But don't worry about how heavy this felt hat is, there are ways to make the felt stiffer without making it heavier.  The simplest way is to use a starch type of spray, you spray the hat and it will tighten up the felt and make it feel and act like one of those heavier and stiffer felt hats.  Remember if you want one of those heavier and stiffer felt hats, they are available, but those heavier and stiffer hats are going to cost you a lot more money.  If you want a nice hat at a good price, then I recommend this hat !!!
B00DN2FA5W|2|I will try to sell it to one of my girl's friends.because it is too big for me, in this brand I need size 6
B00EUSCO52|2|I really wanted a kimono style cardigan for some time and this looked very beautiful in its pictures. However when it arrived the sewing was really odd and off, while the material was beautiful and comfortable which is why i didn't give it a one star, it wasn't wearable in a sense of style. There is a sewing line that runs around the Kimono that bulges out when worn, it is not as long as the picture depicts. Really not worth buying, sloppily put together, and waste of money. I would really say its a shame to waste such brilliant material on such a sloppy design. I would fix it myself but I'm afraid that i would ruin the material altogether. Looks very lopsided and the sleeves stick out a LOT. Not worth money.
B00HUNY1I2|3|Im a pretty lean dude and the large fits me snug. Remember to order with the idea that a large is small, x-large is med, etc. The hood is too small to use without ridicule, and the black is more of a dwrk gray. The material seems cheap but its held togwther so far so it must not that bad.
B000ZN0CXM|3|Obviously the costume will look better on the model. I think the costume she had on is the official and the one they ship out is a cheaper replicated copy. I didnt expect it to be crazy extravagant. The top was like a shiny plastic. The thigh highs were very tight and were also plastic at the top. I wore it to a rave so i didnt want to mess up a good $50 costume. I had a blast and people still liked it.<br /><br />I had to change the bottoms though. They looked like saggy booty granny pannies. So i took the seam off the stinger and attached it to a pair of black undies i had and voila. no more saggy booty. :)
B00CC6ZRB2|5|Cute outfit.  Can't beat the price.
B00B7MH5YO|5|Arrived ahead if time... Good quality.
B004LKEXXA|1|The dress came and it is beautiful! However, the two straps that it comes with are very long and not adjustable. The eye-hooks on them broke within ten minutes of putting the dress on and i had to just tie the straps around my neck. The seam at the bottom of the dress is super skinny and it made it impossible to bend over. I was really looking forward to this dress. The bust part of the dress is extra extra large and left a one or two inch gap inbetween the dress and my strapless bra. It was so horrible. Once i tied the two straps that broke around my neck it tightened up the bust area a pinch. This dress is cheaply made and I am not happy with the fit. It is much shorter than indicated. I would not recommend this dress for anyone.
B00AH9CL56|4|When I ordered these I thought they where going to be your standard cotton socks - i was unaware they are DRESS SOCKS. They are thin, they fit well and stay up pretty well ( I have large calves so they don't go over those). I'd recommend them to anyone looking to step up their sock game.
B001D6GPBI|4|I'm wearing this shirt right now, very comfortable. Dickies is the only brand I look for when buying work clothes. I like their attention to detail. Long enough to stay tucked, if that's what you like. And roomy, without looking like a tent. Great choice of colors, too. Been a fan for years .
B00X1EQVM8|1|The top was huge and the bottom didn't fit.
B0006M6IQ2|5|I read all the reviews and was a bit stressed out over picking the right size (I usually don't buy clothes without trying them on first).  I'm size 8, medium, 5'4\\", 130 lbs and the medium fits perfect.  The sleeves are a little long - but that's better than too short - am I right about that - especially if you are an active person?  I really like the outer zippered pockets and the two inside (unzipped) pockets because I don't like carrying a purse if I don't have to.
B007151Y2K|5|I am a new mom and have been searching for a nursing bra, I've ordered a ton of expensive and not so expensive bras of all makes and brands. This bra, while it felt stiff at first, I washed it once before wearing and it's perfect. I like that it is lined so I can wear pads without them causing bumps in the fabric. Also, I have to say if you don't know your REAL bra size you should take the time to go get messured. I was ordering sizes that were way off until someone professional messured me (for free of course). Well worth it.
B00IDYTAXI|5|ok
B00J2L4F18|2|I love the look of this blouse, and would work with a lot of things for work.  Unfortunately it was too small for me.
B00XCM0ZSU|5|Love it
B00LUGQZD4|5|This little velvet dress and coat is delightful!  I gave it to my<br />grand-daughter for her 4th birthday. She looks darling in it!  I<br />am very pleased with the quality of this product.
B0045H0L1W|2|10 out of the 40 in the package did not work... good thing we had more than we needed for the party. I guess this should be expected when you buy cheap crap, and these are definitely crap.
B002UKOWZM|5|This jacket looks so much better in person. This is not stiff but soft. This is not as a Lee or Levi jacket, but its great for a all year round jacket. The sequins are not flued on they are in fact sewed on. Overall a real nice jacket.
B00838U8SK|4|Very good quality wallet. Small if you're a person like me who carry ony a couple cards and a few bills. More than 30$ makes it a bit bulky. At first it's very stiff so you have to shove a couple cards in the slots for a while before it starts to be able to fit more! Overall nice Hershel wallet for 20$.
B00LSZ6K9G|4|This are a little longer, not as short as the boy shorts. They work for what I use them for and I like them.
B0058XUWPM|5|Mrs. CyberDad here:<br /><br />I was so happy to see these jeans offered on Amazon. I really think the bootcut style is best for my figure, and Calvin Klein is one of my favorite brands. My go-to store in town here carries this brand, but not this style--only the skinnies, which look ridiculous on my not-so-skinny figure. I'm so glad I have an alternate shopping choice--just bought my usual size, and they are great.
B00ID2RZ7I|1|This hat was not at all like I expected. It doesnt have the elegant form depicted in the pic. It's stiff and fits awkward. At least it was only $8 but I'm very disappointed.
B005DIMMXC|1|Order 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear.  Seriously- 2 sizes or you'll be disappointed.
B004PEI45K|1|I would have given this 0 stars if I could. Be sure to read the description. It is literally 5 inches long which is short for even my petite 3 year old. The tutu looks very full in the picture. The material is VERY sheer and translucent. The product that I received is nothing like what is in the picture.
B005CWO3QS|1|its european size. Instead of a large its a medium. The sweater is fine, just wish the description was more clear...........
B00KDEGP7K|4|Fits well. The pants are good for taller boy.
B00K8233CM|5|I like my pants to run a little on the too big side just in case I pick up weight. Just got a new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Smartphone which is BIG.  I need the big screen because; I have very bad eyes.  The roomy pocket in the side leg of these cargo pants is a god send.  Having cerebral palsy I fall a lot so the rugged construction of these pants make them perfect for my situation.  The fit is good.  I'm in that weird range where size 34 waist fits like a girdle and size 36 waist makes me look like an urban thug whose pants droop around their knees.<br /><br />The color is very nice not a color seen everywhere.  I love having pants of an unusual color that has not made it to the masses.  the button is metal but it is a real button not a rivet .  I have a metal allergy and the rivet makes me break out in icky oozing sores due to the rivet's nickel content contacting my skin yuck.  Some reviewers say these are skinny leg jeans well what I got was not skinny leg jeans.  I have normal sized legs and I have plenty of roo,  Now if you have legs the size of umbrella stands then yes these pants legs would be tight and likely a goodly bit uncomfortable.<br /><br />I work with computers and sit almost all day except when I take a break for my chesse curls, peanuts and water fix.  I have not found these pants uncomfortable to sit in over long hours.  The seams in these pants are not digging into my skin or making it uncomfortable to sit.  I don't have a big wide plush backside so there is no natural cushion effect either.  I am a average sized dude not lean and muscular but not a big fat pooh bear either.  I washed the pants and they did not shrink too much in the wash or the dryer.  I like that my pants start off a bit baggy so if they shrink a little the fit improves.<br /><br />Most importantly these pants are not tight around the crotch.  So many of these camo pants are cut in weird ways that tend to put seams in places that stress out a man's &#34;facilities.&#34; The most painful camo pants seam placement does a divide and conquer routine on one's jewels that would make a Navy Seal reveal his secrets quicker than Chatty Cathy!  These pants are comfortable because; they suffer none of the previously referenced defects.  The fabric is soft but not thin and cheap.  The zipper is a respectable quality and seems of durable metal construction.  In all these Levi's Men's Ace Cargo Twill Pant, in Graphite earn my five star rating.painful camo pants seam placement does a divide and conquer routine on one's jewels that would make a Navy Seal reveal his secrets quicker than Chatty Cathy!

B00FCCS9EK|3|LMAO didnt fit these thighs
B009S4S650|5|the wide straps and smooth lining make this the most worn bra I own
B00AI3C94O|5|Fast shipping. Fit perfectly.
B00IUP80GS|3|The style looked nice in the package and picture. The legs are very baggy not form fitting as in the photo. The color is perfect.
B00DTDCAR6|4|The dress is gorgeous. Fits really well... My only issue was I went a size up to make sure it fit... Anyway the skirt part was to short. If ur thick u might want to not go for this one. I had to buy a seperate skirt to lengthen it.
B00I89OR5O|5|My 3 year old grandson was so happy to open these that potty training should be a snap!  He isn't going to want to mess on his favorite Minion buddies!!  Fit is perfect, and they arrived earlier, thankfully, than expected!!
B00CAMBQ54|2|Hi .......You sand the dresses not Same the patcher  , not fir  I don't like it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What I do
B0098II5XY|5|These are great fitting panties for little girs. My daughter loves them. They are well made, wash well, and retain their shape.
B00IGVFPOQ|5|This is a beautiful hat & it does look much better in person than in the pic. The coral is very rich and pretty, & it went perfectly with the Navy blue dress that I wore. I received many compliments on it.
B00GOLEJ9M|5|Just what I needed.  Delivery was super fast!
B00F5VPOGO|3|After reading others reviews, I figured I'd go larger than needed. My son wears a 10/12, so we purchased the 18/20 and it fit perfect. He likes it a lot. I do not.
B00LLS4U3I|4|this is my fourth dress from Sakkas  i was really surprised by quality of fabric.  The fit was good and the  color was as expected.. as always i wash the garment before trying it on. however i would not buy again as this style though very nice is a bit young for me.. I would recommend for younger women
