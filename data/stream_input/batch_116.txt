B00B8Y0QPG|5|We have a 2015 JK and this went on without any difficulty. Look great on! Product as described.
B004SFZZQC|1|This thing came out the box looking used, missing parts and missing the decal... it would have been okay if I got the decal at least. Without the decal, it looks like I got this part from the junkyard. I am very upset about this since pro comp is my go-to brand.
B00UN16Y6K|4|Standard socket. Flimsy but works
B001MYWBF0|1|Well, lets just say that after trying it out on a known good battery, it starts to charge, works for about 10 mins and then says BAD BATT.  The battery charges and holds a charge with an old fashoned charger, but this thing says bad battery on every battery it is hooked up to.  the only thing it does right is the jump start function.
B003RAK9ZG|5|46.00 for dealer to program but it works fine
B00B6FWHDG|5|I was quite skeptical at first if they were going to fit.  They were very tight to install but it makes me feel better knowing that they won't fly off like the old ones did.  They look amazing and fit great.
B003VTCTH4|5|Wonderful
B00NAUKN1I|5|Marker LED lights, look and work well.
B00AXZPFJ8|5|worked flawlessly and had no issues with it. plenty of power
B0002JMLQU|4|Can't really notice a difference
B007GHJ31W|5|Looks great on my red truck.
B001R1Q62W|3|So these headlights are new and look better than the ol oxidized ones before them but the claim to have xenon bulbs is phoney. They just come with regular bulbs so that was kind of a let down. But still decent lights I suppose
B00QN95D8Q|5|had my son riding in 10 minutes..great part
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Nice and bright real bright. Highly recommend for price...:-)
B006WQSEYA|5|Went in as advertized,no performance problems to report.
B0013REXO8|5|I have a 2007 Jeep Wrangler. They were easy for me to install and fit great.
B00B9EY2XC|5|Perfect fit and super easy to install. If I'd know how cheap I could get this part, I would have done the replacement much sooner. Note: does not come with Toyota medallion.
B007O0ODSY|5|Fits perfectly no problems yet. Seems to withstand the heat and pressure quite well.
B00K8WO768|5|Very bright
B00JRM2VFE|5|I'll never use weights to balance a motorcycle tire again! THIS is the way to go! They're easy to install, and the ride is incredible. These make my bike ride super-smooth! Highly recommend them!
B002F5ZCP6|5|Just as expected.
B001GRWDC4|4|worked like it was suppose to.
B00HR26X6O|5|Verry Good Item.
B004GZKW3U|4|Is not functional. This product is just cosmetic, does not actually provide any type of protection for the front end of your pick-up. But only purchased it to improve the looks of the pick-up anyway, so like it just fine.
B004SMGAIW|5|Well built mount.  There are way to many trailer heights to contend with to have just one height.  Well thought out with the anti-rattle bolt.  Will be getting another for family members as a gift.
B00DZ355KE|5|really fast really good
B00C5CQYY2|5|perfect fit , fast install
B00CMMV49U|4|I wear a 6 5/8 fitted hat so i bought a small. This helmet fits me well! Seems to be a quality product for the price. Ventilation could be better.
B0033XXXG4|5|Excellent product, received on time, and installed easily.
B008ZVNL9S|2|they looked very nice on my car,But they did not completely cover the rear windows rubber.
B00D8JLME8|1|tube had cluster of holes in it due to dry rot, same problem as the original tube, which is identical with the new tube, both marked as &#34; made in China&#34;. Bought new &#34;never go flat tire&#34; from Tractor Supply Co.
B005UTS6FC|4|Love the color. It was delivered on time. They were in a huge box and outside of the packaging when received. They were fairly easy to install on my 03 Ford Explorer.
B00V3JM0BO|3|The key fob is great but it did not come with instructions.  Had to find a video on YouTube.  Once programmed it works great.  The only problem is that the buttons are a little bigger and it has set of the alarm a couple of times in my pocket.
B00IA9QR1E|5|Purchased for our 06 Honda Pilot. The back of the driver seat kept falling off. I knew I needed this part and ordered from here for a fraction of the cost at a Honda dealer. 5 Stars
B00MU5X17M|5|groovey
B007JMOSAA|4|fits fine, sun faded after just 1 month though
B00480FIDW|5|Great as advertised.
B006IWA1AS|1|They only came in with two pieces, instead of four pieces. Buyers need to read the Title carefully. It will cost Buyers over $12 to ship it back.
B00QJBLF5S|5|Fantastic! Everyone at work now knows my truck and when I am at work. I really like the way it looks on the truck and it came with small decals that I put on the back glass and these were a nice bonus.
B005BNZ59M|2|Did not notice and improvement using these
B0064IU5FW|5|I have to say it was easy i could not update unit for first time but tech said I'm updated anyway now for tuning it is very easy just follow the prompts<br />backs up your stock tune so you can restore it any time very versatile i noticed the difference right away my stand was banging on the highway performance and torgue increased great bang for the buck and 60 dollars cheaper than american muscle
B001V8PRAS|5|Works well - just as expected.
B005HFYE1O|5|Worked great. Nice plugs that can be connected together for easier handling and installation.
B0007RVLOU|5|Second batch.  Professional results
B00GFR06U6|5|I'm very satisfied with this product, it fits and looks perfect on my 2008 Mazda 3. Very stylish, good quality piece. Since it rubber you can bend it on any form and at any angle. Inside the package was set of  two different type of screws. I installed it in less than 5 minutes.
B00TDDCGNO|5|Great deal on lcd bulbs. I can't tell a color difference between these and my original incandescent bulbs. Ordered another set for my mom's camper
B002UJVNFA|3|Did not fit me very well, a little short, a little narrow on the nose... I am not saying they are bad, they are a great deal and very nice!!! it is just not for a big head like mine I guess, I wear L or XL, so I guess I would say this are S or M at best...
B00BXHATBE|2|Starter stopped working after a few weeks.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Fit nicely in our truck! It's nice to have a space for cups, food, and tissues! well made, good product!
B00KXPXQEE|2|Not happy with this pen. Took forever to get the paint out to the tip. Would not buy again.
B00JJ7J42U|5|Love the safety kit.  Looks great in my new 2015 Jeep Cherokee!
B004HE56BS|5|Fit great...!
B006H34ABY|1|Came apart after the first use. Amazon was great as always and refunded the purchase price.
B00W46HC4K|1|Purchased this Speedometer to replace defective pitot- tube speedo in my pleasure boat. Easy installation but glare is significant.  Tried both yellow and orange back-light operation but glare is so great in direct (and indirect sunlight under bimini top) that this gauge is definitely not worth the money based on my application...a flat glass cover instead of the convex cover would have been a better design, as that would at least allow application of polarization film to eliminate the glare
B000EDUUH6|5|works as advertised
B004I12F0A|5|Fantastic service that brings Amazon, I love it.
B0097MQ6GO|5|Was easy to install and worked the first time. Very happy with this item .  No issue what so ever.
B006ZSUKW4|5|Awesome replacements and at least $20 cheaper than the local auto parts shop (that's about 30% cheaper). The replacement process took all of 5 minutes to complete. No more lift gate falling on top of us when we get stuff out. Would definitely recommend. Great product, great price.
B001U7SR3E|5|The lights came in less than a week.  This is the second time I bought this product.  The last time was 2007, so I am very happy with how long they held up.  This set is just as good and are great on my truck!  Can't beat the price or quality.  Highly recommend these lights. They came with bulbs and fit perfect. Took me no time to install,  use a screwdriver to help line up the bolts into the holes. My headlights are brighter and look sharp.
B003S84ZPW|5|Worked perfectly! I will buy again if needed.
B00GURQIYO|5|good stuff
B00DDQ194Y|2|The quality is not what I expected. When these are installed they stop my window from rolling all the way up.
B0016HPUS8|5|Exact same part as from the factory. Great value. 2003 Silverado  V8 5.3
B000BZJDK2|5|This is the factory original at a very good price. Don't bother with the cheap imitations. This is a complete, assembled unit.
B003721BVK|5|Perfect
B0028BLC0G|5|All good
B003L31X1S|5|A-ok
B000V55NAQ|4|Very good
B006LB9FFI|5|I run this in everything that doesn't have a catalytic converter. ZDDP is good.
B00X123OPC|5|Great brush for cleaning leather seats. Its soft enough where I don't worry about it scratching the leather or wearing the painted coat off.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|You can blow fuses all day long with these! A-OK
B00AVNGM1M|1|Very disappointed. Product came looking like sludge, after shaking, stirring and testing, it still wasn't even close to the product I ordered.
B00DZXP27K|5|Good
B000C7TVPG|5|Great quality and easy to install.  No surprises.
B00T9OQFGG|5|love this seller, starter received in 2 days, starter was perfect match to oem.
B005GX3GFW|3|It doesn't work on the car I wanted to use it on.  The steering wheel is coated with rubber or something like it and the clamp needs something hard to grip firmly.  The spinner should work OK on a car without a &#34;padded&#34; steering wheel.
B0051D3MP6|5|Works great!
B00IK2MNZK|5|POSITIVE
B00960611M|5|loved it, came in time for saturday morning installation
B00B9DZL9W|1|Plastic housing has form marks which allows for leaks. I had to buy different rubber washers and that just slowed down the leaking.  I won't buy again.
B005CNNJ6W|5|The best thing to buy for any style of vehicles, saves your carpet big time from pebbles to dried leaves to snowy slush!
B004PG963M|5|Very strong worked like I expected and solved a big problem for me.
B000XETMW0|5|I welded on a new O2 bung and test fit the O2 sensor. When I tried to remove the sensor it galled up.  The sensor was ruined but this chase fixed the bung.
B004LF4SFS|5|Exactly what I needed and fast shipping
B00WTSW02M|1|The instructions were evidently written by someone who did not know the language. The compass never did work and the battery that came with it was dead within 12 hours. Once the compass went into dormant mode, I had to plug it back in. The backlight never did go off after.10 minutes like the instructions said. The only way to turn the backlight off is to unplug it. I am very sorry that I wasted my money on this product!!!
B009AD8RN0|5|Perfect! I bought this for my son and it's nicely made, comfortable, and shipped fast! Plenty of pockets for supplies and books. Awesome purchase! Get it for a Honda rider!
B00450FLAU|1|My first one was amazing then ended up breaking<br />So I bought another one and I was excited to get it until i opened the box and it was a really cheap plastic one, nothing near the same one as the image<br /><br />I was really pissed off and even broke that one, I will never buy airhorns off these guys 👍👍👍
B000A0ILII|5|Fits great. It is very bright white.
B001O0CQXO|5|Great as advertised.
B000COC50M|5|K&N is a ass kicker system!!!
B00LE61UAS|4|Arrived way ahead of schedule...quality isn&#34;t the best but you get what you pay for
B00GXRL4SQ|2|Two of the four handles came out of the box broken. Just tossed them. Not worth shipping back to China. It took 2 weeks to get. They look cheap too. You get what you pay for
B0050INW48|2|Good but not great of a chain but it's a good quick replacement. Stretch in about a month
B00KRQWYEW|5|Thanks!
B00IEA8R76|5|Got the item fast, installed in 20 minutes and on the road a pleasure for being quiet no more bearing noise
B00CDR4QT4|5|These mounted great and looks awesome!
B001C9KNYG|5|Oem Part . Ways buy genuine like this one
B001P4CP62|5|very good quality
B0002KKT36|5|Differs from picture and not sure if it has &#34;blown Light&#34; or not (doesn't seem to), but it is a 20 amp fuse
B000JZ9T4O|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B007Y882HE|5|good price works great
B00WE9SM2I|3|It fits OK and I'm sure it will function just fine, but I was disappointed to see that it was made in China.<br />Do we make anything here anymore?
B0009NUG66|5|Our car does not have a car rack. It fit fine on our roof and may have scratched it a little, tiny bit, but we weren't worried about that at all. Just be careful if you are worried about scratches on the roof. We took this bag on an 18 hour trip from Salt Lake City, UT to Edmonton, Alberta and back. No leaks in the bag and no leaking through the straps into our car. We had one really heavy rain storm and another light one. Easy to install AFTER I figured out how to combine the four short straps to become two long straps long enough to reach over and through our car. Be sure to do up the velcro. I think that is why there were no leaks.
B003FO2O1G|5|Works GREAT!! We can now receive all local FREE channels in our RV.  Nice and compact vs the old style Winegard wings that we had that we have had problems with since we bought our RV.<br />This can also be mounted to your house as it comes with connectors for Home Antenna.<br />The kit come with everything you need to connect to your existing RV antenna arm, new rubber protectors, a power adapter and electrical cord if you do not have the built in power adapter already installed in you RV.  If you do already have a power adapter installed in your RV do NOT use the one that comes in the kit.  Took less than 10 mins to install.<br />Well worth the money works great with DTV's for Free TV...Enjoy
B0041TS6UM|5|I was very satisfied with my purchase; and I would definitely make additional purchases if needed.
B003HB2AFM|5|Cheap and looks great on red Yaris. I did have to use sizing wires but was super simple to figure out.
B000C9NPBA|5|OEM product that is 3/4 the local price and shipped fast.
B000TK8LY8|5|Works well but the instructions say to remove a metal part inside the tail light, I have a VTX and there was nothing to remove.  I just set the Radiantz inside the light and placed the cover and tightened the screws.  It doesn;t move, all is well.
B00BYQDGIM|4|The bag is more than expected. Missing one backback strap. Do not plan on using it as a backpack. Lots of storage pockets. Fits my Concours 1400 with no handlebar interference.  Packed for four day trip in tank bag alone. Stayed in place, secure mounting. Built well, expect several years of use.
B004LF3HQO|5|A must for eternabond.
B005GYDBNS|5|The best
B006856A6E|3|Good for making your FJ look more like a hummer. Pretty cheap material. Fun for about 3 weeks.
B00P3SLOFY|1|I don't usually give a bad review but I am extremely disappointed in my purchase of the Thetford SmartTote 2.  I bought the 4-wheel 27 gallon.  First, the design makes no sense.  The hose you connect to your RV, while nice to have attached to the tank, is AT THE BOTTOM of the tank.  I'm no rocket scientist but how do you fill a tank using gravity when the input is on the bottom?  Second, the hose connectors are lousy.  I don't know if they are just not sized right or what but they come loose VERY easy.  Yes, I found out the hard way (sorry neighbors and future site renters of lot C-104).  Third, the handle does not secure to the trailer hitch.  We pulled the tank (at 4 MPH or slower) to the dump station and luckily our friends were behind us because when we stopped at a stop sign the handle just slid off.  I'm guessing the tank was still in motion, hitch was not so it just slid up and off.  Now picture a fat old woman running, trying to catch a runaway tank full of...well, nevermind.  Yeah, not a pretty site.  Luckily no spills, only embarrassment.  The video I watched showed a simple process of putting the elbow on the end of the hose and neatly/cleanly emptying the contents into a dump station.  In real life you put the elbow on (remember to have the dump plug propped open) and aim as close as you can because the contents are going to come splashing out as soon as you have the elbow at or below the top of the tank.  Gravity is a you-know-what.  I got my husband to fix another opening on the top so I can fill it from the top, so I'm hoping I can get some value out of this very expensive mistake.
B00H7QZSOS|1|It came to me broke
B006O92UIQ|5|Pedal matches perfect to the clutch and break pedal, fit perfect!
B00PX6DZNK|4|These look great, price is unbelievable. However, there is no accommodation for the arm rests. Not sure if the breakdown is with Amazon or the seller.  Description said it would fit my model 2005 Yukon XL but there were a few issues.
B004GDQ3EE|5|A+++
B00W8HT70C|5|The cargo net fits perfectly.  For the price, it was a good investment and I would recommend this product.
B00BCRMA9Y|4|Pretty good item for the price, the instructions need to be a little more clear. The stirring wheel cover does not fit...I have tried and it is too small prob about 2 inches or so
B00F8TO7W0|5|Looks really nice on the bike
B000C9OS1Q|5|exactly as described!
B004IME2ZK|5|super handy tool, i use it all the time for my POS's
B0045XRK06|5|I got this to replace a cheap imitation...what a difference!  It's solid build quality and the light is bright but not so bright as to be distracting in the dark.  And I barely notice a difference in battery consumption.
B007IX14ZW|5|Works just like the original Bed clamps!
B00JN0U4SQ|1|Tip was broken and it dis colored after return period was pasted I was very disappointed😡
B0080VABAK|5|Fits great and is very comfortable
B00KC3GGNA|5|Great fit good price
B003VAYRNM|5|Very happy with product. It arrived before estimated delivery date.
B00X11N2OQ|5|I'm a 5'4&#34; woman with longish fingers for my height. After reviewing the size chart I got an XS. The gloves are comfortable for most of my hand, but the thumb was too short. To be honest, it wasn't so short that I would go through the hassle of returning them (I'd probably just attempt to stretch them). My 5'1&#34; wife (with shortish fingers) tried them on and found them perfectly comfortable on her thumbs, so she's going to keep them and I ordered another pair in a size Small; I will update this post when the new ones arrive.  UPDATE: The Smalls are great! They fit my fingers well and are very comfortable. I rode for 10 hours this weekend in ~100 degree heat and they stayed cool and comfortable. Very satisfied!
B00IUWM59O|4|Just as advertised, great price and good quality.  The LCD display is a neat but unnecessary bonus, and on my bike the mounting strap covers it so you can't see it anyway once inside the battery tray but that might not be the case on your machine.  The packaging was pretty poor, the battery was inside a single layer unpadded OEM box which was placed in a larger box.  The OEM box did not fit tightly inside the larger box so they filled the gap with air bags.  The air bags burst due to the weight of the battery and the corner of the battery box puncturing it.  The corner of the battery had beaten through both boxes and was smashed slightly on one corner but not to the point it leaked.  The item could have leaked with a little more damage, which would have been a toxic mess.  I needed it quickly so I didn't bother sending it back.  I took photos of the box and battery, I will post those to the Amazon packaging feedback section when I have a chance.
B00T8MRCMK|5|I bought these to put on my motorcycle, and on my truck.  Mounted on my bike, I did not realize I did not torque one down properly, and it came loose, then fell of at 70 MPH, bounced across four lanes of interstate traffic, then rolled to a stop against the center median.  I went back, expecting to find the thing destroyed, and I was stunned to find it intact, with only cosmetic damage.  A few dabs of black paint and you cannot even see the damage.<br /><br />Do not learn my lesson the hard way:  use Loctite on ALL bolts, and tighten them down the right amount.  Do these things, and you will certainly appreciate the strength and quality for the price.
B0051MYL8E|5|Good Value.
B00IBMPF7C|4|Put these on my 98 civic hatch. They fit, but they required a bit of coaxing to get them bolted in place. Now my hatch opens its self with a pop of the handle!
B0073MG19M|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2000 Jeep Wrangler. Very good construction. I couldn't be more satisifyed.
B00UJC65KI|4|Pretty bright. I don't feel like they are brighter than my stock halogens in my fog lights. They do have a purple tint to them compared to my 55watt 5000k hids.
B001D4J9PO|5|Very nice ride. Low but not to low.
B007SVDMWM|5|Pleased
B001P27ZVE|5|ok
B0007VZ5B6|5|If you have a lot of cars to find leaks on this is what you need.
B005K5XVGU|5|Nice looking replacement
B000M6SSEM|5|This is a must have plug for the BMW F650 single spark with fuel injection.  Makes it run like it should.  I wouldn;t have believed it if I hadn't tried it myself!
B00029WYEY|5|Nice and cheaper than my parts store!
B003U4O414|5|Smoothed out the diesel sound from our TDI.
B001CSA61W|5|Fit my truck perfectly, has proved incredibly useful. Product came as described (genuine Canada-made article, rather than some knockoff) and arrived earlier than expected.
B000BPTVTK|5|The Best.  Works great
B00077PH5Y|2|I bought this for the rear area on my 2003 Acura MDX. I have had a factory add on mat in it since it was new, but recently my dog chewed a corner out of it.<br />This mat is extremely light duty and doesn't really fit since there is no allowance for the 3rd seat seat belts to clear the Mat on each side. I am very disappointed.
B001EAQTRI|5|My husband wanted to stream Pandora and MP3 from his Android phone to his car radio via the Aux port.  But, his car was wired for iPod, not Aux.  So he found a iPod-to-Aux converter cable, ran it under the dash and back to the console.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line he picked up what he calls  &#34;ground loop&#34; interference.  There was an irritating whine in the audio that made his 'Droid patch unusable.  He's a HAM and has had experience with this before.  Immediately after plugging this device in the signal was crystal clear.<br /><br />He's happy so I'm happy.
B001AVON4M|3|Good quality, not really cheap, not really fast delivery.
B005SB6S3Y|4|Works well. Easy set up. Noticed the difference right off. Good product. Great price.
B0063CU6GM|5|Sorta not what I expected, it's growing on me,love the look
B011D67O6W|3|Product was shipped fast, is well built and looks good on the truck.<br /><br />The problem is that this comes with nearly 100 small pieces and no instructions were included what so ever. The listing states that the package comes with &#34;easy-to-read installation and figures&#34; but it does not come with any instructions what so ever!<br /><br />After nearly 2 hours of frustration I was able to find a video online that helped me figure it out.<br /><br />Not sure if this was just an error with my package or if none of them come with directions (I noticed one other review that said it did not come with directions)<br /><br />I suggest this issue is corrected soon or the listing is changed before you have a bunch of upset customers.
B001C9QX8Q|5|These are probably some of the best struts money can buy. My ride is excellent now. I will be buying kyb struts from now on. Installed these on my 2004 mazda 3 i
B0070Y35OC|1|Hard to install.
B0001EWQYI|5|they stayed put even at high speeds
B00VNQLDQK|3|Two of the bulbs out of four the metal connection pieces needed to be longer ,,
B00K1C1WC2|4|they do the job
B000C57WB8|5|Great, high quality product that is easy to install. Remember that Moog parts do not come with installation instructions.
B005HBQ81C|5|Had some minor damage to the handle nothing's to do with the product just cosmetic defect . Over all very happy with it .
B004C6OBBC|5|works!
B00M9IAJQQ|5|I got this to keep my carseat cool for my son, it gets the job done and is easy to use!
B006D7YZ1O|4|Installed on a customer car and found fit to be surprisingly good! We usually struggle with cheap aftermarket parts, but this one lined up nice. Obviously not OEM but for the money it was a fantastic deal
B000JKPURY|4|I bought this for an '05 Scion XB.  That big flat roof begs for a rack.  I didn't want the kind with the straps and clamps, so my choices were either adapting something from a junk yard or going with this DynaSport.  I could only find one YouTube video (which surprised me) - some guy who put the rails onto a Camry or something to drive thousands of high-speed miles with a cargo carrier.  He said it worked fine and didn't leak.  What swayed me in the direction of the Dynasport were the waxed screws that seem to work fine as waterproofing.  Drilling 14 holes in your roof - even one as beat up as mine - takes some combination of guts, despair and stupidity.  So it has rained - hard - and all seems well.  Also, like the guy in the Camry video, I can shake the whole car holding onto the rack with a reassuring sense of solidity.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is that the installation was quite tricky.  I have no idea what is supposed to RELIABLY hold the assembled rack in place while you mark drill holes OR what sort of &#34;marker&#34; is long and narrow enough, but I ended up screwing the rearmost points in and then drilling the rest of the holes through the feet rather than marking, removing, drilling and re-positioning as instructed.  I stuck a small brush with paint down the holes of the feet and hoped for the best. The XB has 128K, which helped me relax with this process.  I would say you should take Perrycraft's warning about the capacity of the crossbars seriously.  They seem strong enough but the attachments to the tightening wheels do not inspire confidence.  To end on a positive note, it looks great - like a factory rack.
B002OQ5ZTY|4|Relatively easy to install. It does what it's supposed to (keep the wind off your chest). Worth its price.
B002G47GE6|5|Purchased for 2010 VW Jetta.  These fit correctly in the wiper arms, unlike the universal fit blades that end up raising the arm to use the adapters for attachment.  And the price tag sure beats buying from a dealer.
B000K00DSO|5|This gas cap was the exact original that broke from my SUV. The best part there was no typical high mark up from the dealership but you get the same exact part.
B000H0RC8Q|3|average bulb. nothing really fancy about it.
B00C10R226|5|work good just what I needed
B005A3YHKQ|5|Great deal! ... I received everything that was promised in the item's description and picture.
B00QQZZY0O|5|It did the trick! All we needed was the replacement mirror; the local auto stores wanted to sell us the whole unit for well over $100.
B00LHUI4XM|5|Beautiful!  Exactly as promised.  They look so much better than dealer plates on our new Lexus 450H.  The stainless steel looks great on white. The tiny problem I had was taken care of my very nice people immediately!  Many here in Santa Barbara, Ca. ask where I got these nice plates!<br /><br />david
B000BQWLE6|3|Did not realize how small this was. Should be called a mini trash can!
B009S94RK8|2|Does not fit Buick... which was listed in the description that it would.
B00JH3EU6G|4|useful item.
B00E3BQLN2|5|Easy installation, good looks and made to last! Small enough not to be obtrusive large enough to seen!
B00CFALFXY|5|Great for cleaning glass. No streaks or fibers left behind, they also washed well,  I will definitely purchase them again.
B000CO7NGI|5|The bulb is an exact fit for my motorcycle and installation was a breeze. Completely satisfied.
B00DR1RHYQ|5|The color is more cyan than blue! Beware, in my case this was PERFECT quality is great, the shipping packaging is great! Comes in rigid plastic and individually separated so it won't chip the paint during shipping. I had no issue with chipping or scratched paint though
B00NWQJZNW|5|Extremely well built and a perfect fit in the mule
B004MXJGV0|5|Perfect fit!<br />So easy to repair myself!
B00JVX5I7W|5|This is a great vehicle warning light, I've purchased 30 of them and will buy more.
B008ML769W|1|Worth about one dollar. Very thin and bent just peeling off the backing. Save your money.
B00SLKTBZG|4|Got to fit eventually.  Brackets mislabeled; not the greatest hole / space alignment.  Look good and functional when installed.  I'd buy again.
B0002Q7ZKK|5|5-star rating on all aspects of the transaction and product.
B000C9FWMU|2|Rotors were not true from the factory which is ultimately a simple fix but not what you expect with a new item
B000H3TUE2|5|The best yellow bulbs on the market
B001G6VA1K|3|Wrong product. I looking for an air cabin air filter and received the engine air filter.  Nothing to indicate on the site that it was not for the air cabin. The only thing it stated was it fits my car.  However, I just replaced the engine air filter instead. Bought a air cabin filter at the local auto store.
B0082365AQ|3|Works as long as yu are going straight.  Doesn't have enough cross strapping to hold the kayak in place on a turn.
B004I0YY7I|5|as expected and a good price
B0070I9POC|5|Very good merchandise, I have already bought 2 sets, this is to help what friend buy
B000F5LJ3M|5|I was finally able to get the damned tie-rod ends loose on my BMW!  What a PITA job that has been.
B005FK3Q0G|5|fit my mazda 6s (2004) perfectly and i think they work better than the ones that i replaced although i don't remember what they were like when they were new.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Works perfectly and didn't cost me an arm and a leg.  Save yourself the trip to a garage and check your engine light with this!
B0015PN010|5|Stupid fracking BMW tie-rod ends!  Had to buy three or four different ball joint/tie-rod tools to get them apart.
B000A0CANA|5|Great fit.
B000C2AOES|5|I installed this valve cover gasket on a 1995 Ford Pickup with the 300ci 4.9L 6 cylinder.  Its Fel-pro's blue rubber material that I have had the best luck with of all aftermarket gaskets.  After cleaning everything really well, install the gasket dry and torque down the cover to spec.  So far I've never had a leak when using one of these gaskets.  Watch out for those vacuum lines since they are brittle now, and you will need the upper intake manifold gasket because unless it is just replaced last week, it will break when you take off the upper intake.
B00S75VRL6|5|work well.
B00HLUW438|5|Watch your sizing, mine is just a little tight in the temple area. I can still wear it though.
B00YEDOASM|5|fit perfect! very nice quality doesn't feel cheap in your hand im mad I didn't by this years ago
B00159ER54|5|As described.
B00H08AK1Y|5|This is awesome.  I put it on my helmet this morning, switching out the clear face shield.  This is clear and easy to see out of - not too dark.  I wasn't riding straight into the sun so I don't know if it's dark enough that you'd need sunglasses in addition to this.  Edited: It's now 10 months after the initial review above: The darker visor is great when riding on sunny days, but you will need to also wear sunglasses with it if riding into the sun. There is plenty of room for this in this Shoei RF1200 helmet.  I eventually put the clear visor back on since my rides took me into the night hours, and I found this visor too dark for nighttime riding.  If riding in town, I can put clear glasses on under the visor and just flip it up, but I often ride on the highway and like the added protection of the closed face shield. On long multi day rides, I take both face shields since the handy pinlock system makes it easy to quickly pop off and switch out.
B00O2XJ0PW|5|I purchased a brand new car a few weeks ago and was looking for a keychain that's vibrant and with good material. This is it! I highly recommend it!
B007KDLQY4|5|nitido
B004MKR9DK|1|It's a lot bigger than I thought it was
B003C4UJAC|3|Seems OK, but mine did not come with the grounding washer with male spade connection that is pictured.
B004969R6Y|5|Fits and works
B006ID2ZME|3|I've had these before but I broke one.  These work fine but once they are positioned they seem to want to stay so if you don't get them where you want them they can be aggravating.
B00UW1T31Y|5|Upon arrival ill fix it right away and no hassle, it did my expectation..
B006JRJVVC|4|Our main windows face west so we often get the afternoon sun. The shade was the perfect height for the large window.  We have noticed a significant change in temperature when we get home in the evening.
B00US778XM|3|Poor quality. Logo is offset.
B00OPMIR2M|3|Great for checking tire pressure, not so great for deflating - should have a pin on the opposite  end to deflate and lower tire pressure
B000KITTYU|5|Works great
B000EDQQCY|5|Easy to install.
B006ZAPE78|4|Didn't fit my 2000 fatboy.. but with some modifications to my stock trim ring I was able to make it work.
B009DK6CQO|5|good part
B00NTU18KY|3|Works as advertised. It arrived in the packing with the screen cracked.<br /><br />It still works but the quality control is pathetic.
B00IY2CR3E|5|It works like it is suppose to work.
B00192QSVS|5|Everything worked out great
B008HBM0H0|5|I do like the roof racks a lot. They are wide and strong enough to handle a sofa or whatever I want to throw up there. Farther more, they look good and match my Kia Sportage.
B000T2W336|5|Happy to still find these straps for our old Yakima rack.  Work perfectly.
B000C8T96Q|4|good
B0023VBHUQ|5|Verry Good Item.
B00OAC84V6|2|very small length, found no value in it.
B005FNKFYI|5|Easy to set up; love that only need my truck key, no extra keys to carry.
B00SFS9FI2|5|These are a serious improvement over the stock bulbs in our 2010 Subuaru Forester. We're really enjoying the superior illumination when we have to drive a night. We live in an are with a lot of deer and are now able to see them much earlier than before, so we have a better chance to avoid problems.
B00L843KIQ|5|correct parts fast shipping
B001TXWNLQ|5|Got 1 in every bag Love'em in case i forget wall charger
B00QUSVN6G|5|Fast shipping, great product.
B00NHUN41C|5|Good quality, easy install.
B00UGDAVKU|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Power Generator. Easy charge my two 35Ah in parallel.
B000EQ8GSI|5|They were a breeze to change out (one thing on the PT that is easy)!!! And they really added the stability that was missing after 65k miles.<br />This is the second car I installed them on, I was pleased with the other car, and love them on this one.
B000COO2QM|5|item as described, shipped and packaged well
B00P6M0AO8|5|Good quality and speedy service.
B00D4IQ0G8|5|I've used these several times on my trailered kayaks.  Other than a little road-dirt, they've held up quite well to highway speeds.
B00KTJ8KRC|5|The fobs worked very well after dealer programming.  Remind them to Program the honks of you want this.
B005QAFL62|4|This shade works for my 2014 Odyssey, and I really like that I no longer have the frustration of trying to keep a regular jumbo sunshade up (without sliding down then falling off when slides below the visors).  It also covers the most bottom part of windshield, thus shading the speakers also.<br />Though am a little disappointed in the way it is cut around the rearview mirror.  This picture posted makes it look like the mirror cutout is much less than the actual sunshield is (the rearview mirror cutout is quite a bit more than it needs to be, thus not blocking as much sun around the mirror).<br />Overall though, much better than a &#34;regular&#34; jumbo size you can buy in the stores.
B003074EUW|5|Easy to install works great
B000CET8XY|5|Fits perfectly making the install that much quicker, very strong pump working great been in use about everymorning since the install due to how dusty it is in my area and still running just fine.
B003CG9QFY|5|awesmome
B0014DILKI|5|Legitimate heavy duty, nice item.
B00E59L7PE|5|Excellent fit.
B006TMM9V6|5|Was on time and as promissed
B00QFSAPP6|5|Works flawlessly!
B00IO9BRNS|5|Good product for the money! I'm pleased with the performance.
B0000AZ6JK|5|Worked great and was exactly like the solenoid already on the motor. Best part was it is so much cheaper than buying one from the boat shop or automotive store.
B00CPN0BB8|5|Arrived in 3 days as expected.
B001OMQK6G|5|fit my custom chopper perfectly on a buel engine
B002P8OY52|4|It is good but more shiny than my original one<br />It is vibrating when you speed up to 50 m/ hour
B00R860JEG|5|I have bought this item some time back. Not only that, but I have also placed a custom order with Masonic exchange and those people are awesome. Excellent quality, good prices and most of all friendly people whom you feel comfortable dealing with!! Thx guys:.
B000OEDQQW|1|A major safety issue -- the cap covering the blade snaps onto the body too tightly and it requires a hard jerk to remove it so the device twists in your hand.  I came very close to a serious cut.  Also the plastic-capped holding screw wouldn't tighten all the way so the razor blade is loose enough that it can (and has) fall out.  I would avoid this item 100%.  Update:  I saw so many positive reviews I bought another one of these.  Holy buckets -- the same cap problem still exists.  Have to bang it on a hard surface to get the 'safety' cap in place.  I put on a bit of vaseline and some W% 40 and goes on by hand now but very tight.  Have to rock it back and forth to work it off.  If the blade is off by one 100,000 of an inch the cap doesn't go on easily.  This is really a bad product in my view.
B00B3L36D8|3|Cute but cheaply made
B002D3KR4Q|5|Had it for about 6 months. it's worked great. it's protected my bumper against kids sports gear and luggage. I wish it kept its color better, but I wasn't surprised the sun faded it.
B00BLKXW9O|5|Replacement transmission oil from Volvo xc90. After flushing it fixed my shifting issues!
B00EDFM66E|4|Absolutely perfect for what I needed it for. Very bright and no issues installing. Really added some drama to our project (in a good way). Only problem was, one was broken in our pack. Very impressed with their customer service. Very prompt at responding to my emails. It's been about a month and we haven't gotten our replacement bulb yet, but they warned us ahead of time that it would take a while to reach us, so this is not surprising or upsetting. Over all, great product and good customer service.
B000IG20RW|4|I use this grease in my heavy equipment tree mulcher rotor bearings. I also use it to grease the pins in my heavy equipment. My only complaint is that it is a little &#34;funny&#34; compared to other greases. As the temps heat up down south, the grease gun on the back of my truck leaks this grease and the pins and fittings on my machinery will leak the grease. It seems to do a good job of lubricating but I think I need something that will stay tackier or hold up to high heat better. Any suggestions?  I'm a big Lucas oil fan and want to continue using their products.
B0010E3IU4|5|great filter at a good price.... quick ship....
B00IY3YLCI|4|These lights are brighter than I thought they would be, only thing I would like to see changes is the wiring harness. They should have the wires come out of the lights with each on the opposite sides instead of both on the same side. It would make it look cleaner.
B004I0TZWW|5|Exact fit and included bulbs. Very satisfied.
B000NPUJQC|3|does what you think it should do
B002C7DSIK|5|As advertised.  worked well for purposes.  Delivered on time.
B0031I0NDM|5|Perfect fit
B0016IYARO|5|Good
B00EEA1IXK|5|item fits perfect and arrived on time
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Great Product and great service..
B00BTGSGFK|5|Love them and they have lasted through 20+ polishes and more than a few washer/dryer cycles. Still going strong.
B00Y1HSXE8|3|The kit arrived rather quickly,  The lights really do come in a very nice alum case which you have to figure out something to do with it, too nice to throw away.  The quality seems to be as good any other brands, One of their selling point is the slim transformers and they are indeed smaller than non compact units.  However they do not mention or show a separate driver located in a plastic box larger than a match box.  If you have sufficient room this should not present a problem.  I however was installing this on a motorcycle with very limited space, I was able to adhere this box to the back of the head light and it barely fit.<br /><br />The light output is however outstanding and well worth installing.  I used the 6000K model which is bright white and very visible
B00NIGN52S|4|great
B00KBH642A|4|Good
B0000UUU9Q|5|Perfect fit looks great
B000J2JE7Y|5|worked perfectly
B004GCTY82|5|fit as was suppose to. cheaper than ford dealer
B001FAI9Y8|5|Great Product!
B0009VIPYI|5|I use this on my GMC Sierra 1500 lug nuts, and it works great. I had been using a microfiber towel and trying to get in around the lug nuts, but it never really did a great job. This is sturdy enough to get in there and clean out the brake dust. Hopefully its durable.
B0016KH254|1|Did not fit my vehicle even though it said under the description that it would fit.
B001JT33LY|2|Too big for SUV
B00XPTJ91Y|3|The e-clips that hold the pins in are useless. I went to the hardware store found some that looked like a giant bobby pin and they worked great.
B00KNNPECS|5|Value for money
B000LNBLTK|5|I used these tools to remove the inside of the door on a Hummer 2 to replace a side mirror. These made the job so much easier and worth the price several times over even if I never use them again. I'm not a machanic but I was able to do this with perfect results and saved a lot of money not using the dealer.
B001H2C9PO|5|If you've never invested in a new steering wheel, or you don't have leather on your wheel, you should! Great product, very happy!
B00E5OUOCQ|1|- The # 1 objective of a Sunshade is to stay put once you place to help against the Suns rays. I drive a Toyota Camry and this shade kept on falling off. It was very frustrating! Total FAIL
B0060KKQ5S|5|Works great
B0024E5XOS|3|Its ok
B008XO6XME|5|Exactly what I needed to help my 63 Chevy II get traction!
B005GQTHDE|5|Very nice addition lowered the car just enough to look good
B004A2IFII|5|This is the perfect kit at the best price available for powerstroke fuel filter replacement.  Don't  mess around with other options; this OE kit is the way to go.
B00475I38K|5|High quality
B00VESRDU2|5|Awesome
B005R57J34|1|Not 1/2 hp. Possibly not even 1/3 hp.  Starts slow, stalls with just a few ounces of pressure.  Runs very, very, very hot, in a short period of time.  Don't waste your money.  This is a piece of junk.
B00853A6FI|5|Great product gives extra sense of security when you've got something in bed of your truck
B0066STTKM|5|It was the correct part and it fits.
B004A512TO|5|Worked on my 2009 VW Routan SEL (Dodge Caravan, etc.) New bits are easier to snap in then to clean old bits.
B0022ZCTZU|5|Best product that I have found for cleaning
B00MEWMH26|4|It is much more noisy than most helmets I have used since 1972.
B004BTAJ2A|5|Best fitting w b eel cover i have purchase looks good feela beter
B00NWVGC74|4|Smaller then expected
B004A7VT18|4|Good
B008XCUX0E|5|Easy to use and large display numbers.<br />I mess around with boats and have a lot of small outboard engines.  This tach is simple to use and really durable.  I have already used it a dozen times, with all positive results.
B000KZ1XVK|5|Works great, just as expected.  Have had it for several months now.
B00GVRK7WC|1|Color was not even close to color presented on add.
B00KTAUK3S|5|Perfect fit.  Lawnmower starts 1st pull, runs excellent.
B00D8NAD1M|1|I needed 1 blade for a 2005  frontier and the blade received doesnt fit
B009DK9BLW|5|Fit my 1992 Jeep Cherokee well.  I looked and looked for replacement tubing for the washer fluid and eventually decided it was worth it just to buy the whole arm. Has been on my jeep for 6 months and still works well.
B00G3BOXZI|5|good
B00LXCRLR4|5|Arrived on time and was a simple install.<br />Very happy with the end result. Nice, clean look!
B000BNXRBU|5|Thank you.love trim.thanks
B0019I662S|3|ok
B006QH55YM|5|Very satisfied with this blue top D34m battery. Came well package using the Frustration Free packaging. Packaging consist of accordion-like cardboard in thick layers surrounding the free sitting battery inside the box covering ALL sides for protection.  I used this battery just as a portable power supply along with a 500watt inverter.  Came in handy camping powering some lights around campground, charging phones....and after 2 days camping the battery is still full.  Great to keep in house in case of emergency which is one reason why I wanted to purchase this and the Minntoka Battery supply center case which is a Very nice product as well.  Safe to use inside home of course vs an actual generator where you need appropriate ventilation....but of course a generator you can power some big boy toys : )
B00BQWQLP4|5|Big difference in headlights will buy for my other vehicles
B0037ZD7MI|5|Excellent quality at a reasonable price! Highly recommended!
B009HQ6ZWA|4|The part OK and fit was good
B000CRO4IK|5|Just like what previews say, simple, neat and very helpful
B00DOLOGC0|5|It works thanks
B00DJBWGWC|3|Package arrived sooner than expected.  No hardware in the package.  Made a special trip to town for new nuts and bolts.  The item fit perfectly but wasn't an easy project.  Next time I'll let the dealer deal with it.
B002EBSLA4|5|great filter cheap price
B00N160W1M|5|Fast shipping and good product! I recommend!
B00HLYJBWG|4|Was OK,,,,& Liked,,by Person sent to!
B000CLOU1W|5|good
B005493JDM|5|I used this product for the first time and I'm extremely pleased with the results. It saved my wife's motorhome from water damage. Thank you J-B Weld!
B000BRJOV8|5|I ordered this RV Propane Tank Cover but expected it to probably be low quality.  WOW was I surprised!  This cover is excellent quality and looks and fits great on our RV propane tank.  Thanks for such a quality product!
B00XE197P6|5|Our son loved this helmet, has not only the outer visor, but has an inner visor also, including the front half completely comes open. Great for on an off road ridding. Very good helmet for the price!
B000BO48XU|5|Soild product
B00LVTZLU8|4|They look great for just a few weeks they they fade a little bit.
B00B2W4A0G|5|excelente producto
B0041PW7C4|5|Package came in on time. Works great!
B00009PGNS|5|Drove from the lower 48 states to Alaska.  Cooler worked great.  No issues.  Be sure to also buy the 120VAC adapter.
B002OAT7LW|5|Works great for me, after 4,000 miles, no stone chips!
B000GFCO3U|5|Good product.
B004XDJPNI|5|Just what I needed
B001J8OF1W|1|more brown than this picture
B00AQ2D4C8|5|Looks and works great. Easy to assembly and fairly light. Used it to load camping gear, everything fit well. Be sure to get long ropes (not bungy) to secure stuff.
B0049DTA5A|5|Great
B00K7VE2VK|5|Performs as well or better than any other waterless car wash, economical.
B001C6Q8CK|5|Fast delivered fit my 4.0 2002 jeep grand Cherokee Laredo perfectly !!!
B00G1BXINI|5|Looks great on my Z3 for a reasonable price
B008F9FBSE|5|Love this thing. I have a massive collection of Loki stuff and this went on my laptop case. Now my laptop looks incredible.
B000UTTOFS|5|its a great tool for HVAC techs.
B00BVF1QKQ|5|This product is great, and shiping and handling as promised on time. Thanks!
B0017OAKXA|5|Great as advertised.
B004BWU8H8|5|Fast delivery and happy with the &#34;Locking Under Seat Storage&#34;. Easy to install. The only hard part was unscrewing my seat bolts because their screw tight. Note: I recommend screwing the seat bolts back about 45 ft ib or maybe more but I screw them back 45 ft ib.
B002INP6QU|5|Great value.
B00FGKGJ40|4|This is great stuff. Applied 2 coats waiting 12hours between each coat. Then applied butter wet wax. Terrific shine on my 2011 Ford F-150 Platinum. Will for sure order more. Thanks chemical guys.
B00PNUIKDG|5|works wonderful came on time as they said it would
B013Q39YWM|5|Great product. Highly Recommend.
B00ZLPABGC|4|Seem to be of decent quality, although not sure if it is glass. I like the style, low profile, no large rim, although this size is possibly too small for the passenger mirror in a truck.
B008WAA2MG|5|great product.
B009K4H42Y|5|I bought these and got the A01 filters just like in the description. It's Honda OEM quality. What more can you ask for?
B00B0C15N8|5|Installed on a 1999 Cobra.  Awesome product looks good and works well.
B00KXPNKPE|1|Terrible product. Unable to get smooth finish.  Difficult to get paint to tip.  total waste of money.
B0002Z9NKG|3|Installed two on my dual exhaust 1965 Ford Galaxie 390 V8 4bbl.  Honestly, they are too quiet for this vehicle.  I was hoping for a good rumble when you hit the gas, but with Delta 50s it is barely that, if any.  Went with a recommendation and glad they allow for conversation in the car, but wish I'd gotten something with more muscle and character.
B00FBQEN4C|5|These side window shades fit like a glove & keeps the inside of my Lexus cooler than before I had them. Great product!
B00F7H0KR4|5|We love it
B000C7YQDI|2|I am confident the quality of this product is fantastic. However it does not fit a 71 camaro like I was assured it did. Has tabs that stop proper penitration that is needed to reach the lock mechanism. Just a FYI  for others.
B00MXBYAZA|3|These are awesome but run WAY way small.  I normally wear a 16, sometimes 14 in women's jeans and couldn't even pull these all the way up.  The size 16 would probably fit someone who wears a size 11/12.
B0049DYB0E|5|as described...fast shipping
B00RTLUPVC|5|Good funnel
B0002U2V1Y|5|It's a ton of work, but SOOOOO worth it. The hood of our Jeep SRT8 had all kinds of junk in the paint, but, after a couple of clay bar sessions, it's almost all gone. The difference is amazing.
B001P6GONU|5|Great briefcase for the money. It doesn't get a lot of hard use but seems to be sturdy enough and looks nice.
B008XN7NUG|5|Admittedly I've had it for half a day, but I've hooked up to 5 different OBDII vehicles and I've had no problems with communication or sending commands. The menu structure and commands seem straightforward, and were easy to understand with a small amount of exploration. Interestingly, the Hyundai Accent I plugged into did not indicate the readiness status of the monitors (when using the Hyundai specific function), but by backing out and using the &#34;generic OBDII&#34; I was able to see the status of the monitors. The Hyundai specific menu did have options and live tests for ABS, Airbags and TCM. I was able to access them and run tests without a problem. It was a bare bones model Accent, so there weren't other systems present to read (or fool with :) . I was able to control many relays and read much data from many systems on a 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix (loaded). I had similar experiences on 2 Subaru's and an Acura RSX-type S. I'm really glad I read the great review at myscantools.com/autel-ds708-2015-review/ before deciding to buy as it cleanly laid out the pros and cons of the tool, and really helped me make the decision to buy.
B004GDN4DC|1|great fit on the hard plastic part. the main problem is the built in hardware/bolts are too short to go through the bumper.<br />cannot thread the nuts (which by the way didn't come with the merchandise). would have been a good fit if the bolts are long enough to clear the bumper.
B0084L0YR6|5|correct fit
B0042ORWI8|5|this made the job easy and its not noisy like the other replacements out there
B00CKING1K|5|good cheap replacement mirror
B00068OQBU|4|They work as you would expect.  Not sure how else to put it!
B0080HJL7S|5|I received this bag for free in order to write this review.<br />I love this bag. It is well made, sturdy, keeps itself open so it is easy to put trash in while in the car. i put one of those plastic grocery sack inside this bag just to make it easier to empty, but you don't have to it is lined and could be used as a cooler if you need it to. I like the adjustable strap. I strapped it on to my gear shift, but it could easily strap on the headrest for a back seat trash can. It looks so much nicer than just the plain plastic bag I had hanging from my gear shift before!
B00CDGNX26|1|Did not work in my 2008 dodge ram 2500.  The led bulbs on that truck are built in the board and can not be replaced by turning them out!
B001TEKPPG|5|Easy to replace. Confirmed direct fit 98 Mitsubishi Montero. Works and looks exactly like original
B00306YESK|5|Great product, lightening fast service!
B00GI781BY|5|Bought this to fit the dome light in my daughter's  Honda Fit.  It fit perfectly and popped right in. I really like how bright the white light is on this bulb. It lights up the entire car!
B007NU0FOQ|4|For the price this is a fun little unit. I put it in the grill of my race car just for grins. The remote is chinsy, and the control box seems kind of cheap, too. The amount of wires going from the box to the bar (like.. 15 or so) means extending it to longer than provided would be quite a task. However the bar is bright and there's a ton of different patterns and colors to play with. The included ability to make it function like a light bar with the extra wires (2 greens, etc) where it'll do brakes and turn signals is neat, although I didn't use that portion of it. I probably wouldn't trust it in the elements, especially winter driven vehicles. Build quality is fairly good for the LED bar, too, that doesn't feel too chinsy. Overall though it's a fun, cheap lighting product. Knight Rider cars DO apply.
B00MOR4CFQ|3|Worked great for several weeks great light pattern and brightness, then started to loose some of the LED boards on one the other randomly flickers boards on it way out. Had to buy another set just to get replacement bulbs. Now looking at my 5th replacement bulb. New Brights has not responded to my emails yet.
B0016OIH0O|5|Great product.  I have Husky Liners in most of my cars.  Great investment!
B00EF3SAJQ|5|I was using a foam block rack system, for transporting a 40 pound recreational kayak, which worked well but flexed the roof of my 2012 Chevy Cruz more than I was comfortable with. This rack system adjusted perfectly for the supports to sit on the roof rails of the car. My first use was taking my kayak on a 240 mile round trip in 105 plus degree weather. The rack was easy to install and there was no movement at all of the racks or kayak.traveling at 75 mph. The foam blocks , I already had, easily slipped over the crossbars. The roof of the Chevy Cruz has a pronounced curve which may help with the rack staying in place.The straps are similar to the ones that came with the foam block system I had, and are adequate for the load I'm hauling.I did super glue the pads to the supports and had no problems or movement.
B000CITTW0|4|work well for saving door hinges on a taller truck. can't beat the deals on amazon.
B0031I0NF0|5|Great value, no issues, I would certainly purchase these again, they do just what they should and fit my 1995 Corolla without any issues.
B004CS3BPW|3|Hard to find a really well-made anything anymore. It works. I had to replace mine as they got &#34;stuck&#34; too often. This will probably happen again in time.
B005BNP7UO|2|My Husband had a week and it broke, very unhappy with this product.
B007O5GXWS|5|works great, easy to install
B00ARUT5UO|5|It was just what I needed and a very good price. Service was awesome!!!
B008NXQ0GO|5|Took chance purchasing this at a Truck Stop/Gas Station. It has more than exceeded my expectations! Unlike other inverters that we have owned, this one is quiet.....none of that loud irritating cooling fan noise! It easily powered two laptops, a tablet and a cell phone. Great Product!!
B007AAUTG8|4|works good give it a 90.
B0007TQWME|5|great gloves for the price
B00P8XAGI0|4|worked perfectly!
B0046U4YPM|5|2000 ZX-3 Ford Focus. Car had major vibration issues through the steering wheel and at idle you could feel it through your wrists, made the car not fun to drive. I have done motor mounts for other cars before but this one made a REALLY good difference in drive quality, I did replace all 3 but did replace this one first. I would try this one first if you are having the symptoms I had. Install was quite easy, there are videos on youtube to make it easier. A jack under the engine with a wood block is necessary after you pry it out as the stud will not be center. Just watch the video its a piece of cake and makes a HUGE difference. Build quality seemed the same as OEM.
B00BI2APMW|5|Great pocket scan! Pays for itself
B001AWLIGC|5|vary nice
B00MUF4Q6M|2|The keychain has hex screws holding it together. Within a month of buying this, one of the screws had come out and was lost somewhere. Within 3 months I had lost another one.<br /><br />The leather is high quality and the metal seems good too, but the fit and manufacture seem a little underwhelming. I am kind of disappointed that this didn't really last very long. Otherwise, it's a nice idea for a keychain, with the removable ring.
B004JO7QYQ|5|I got this for my son's Birthday.<br />He has a 1997 Jetta and it is his baby so this fits him perfect.
B00S5ZXC7A|3|Had no problems connecting to my Android phone or the Torque app with my vehicle. Android even gives me the option to use mobile data while connected so I don't lose access to the Internet when using the adapter.<br /><br />Problem is the adapter is very slow at communicating with my vehicle compare to a super mini Bluetooth adapter. This one reads an average of 4 PID's/sec whereas my Bluetooth super mini achieves 13-14 PID's/sec. This makes a huge difference in the update speed of gauges when using Torque or similar apps. I tested on another, newer model,  vehicle and the super mini achieved 24 PID's/sec where this one only managed 8-9 PID's/sec. Bottom line it's too slow to be useful.
B003UG7SK6|1|OMG, i'm sorry but this darn thing is super flimsy and will not even hold the weight of the placard.  It keeps popping off and any slight bend in the clip makes the whole thing fall apart. Back to the drawing board, PLEASE!
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Don't leave home without it. I have now purchased three, one for each of my kids and for myself. Its the best thing, so many uses besides jumping a dead car battery. The company should market it for use in emergencies. I carry it around to ball games so I never run low when I stream from my phone.
B008FCE7C2|4|The ones I got where brand new OEM/GM stuff with GM paperwork and all that - works as expected. The only reason for the 4 out of 5 is that the GM design is bad - the rails are to close to the roof, and they dont go far enough forward, so rear antenna has to be removed to mount most ski boxes..
B002302CAG|3|Great fit for my need (trunk cargo net) & I use it daily. The plastic hooks come off more frequently than I would like, and one has already broken. Not thrilled about either of those points.
B009AA8IHI|5|EASY TO INSTALLED
B0067UAK02|5|Price was key. Unit is working as expected. Sensor connector was rather tight fitting compared to original but it did click into place with some persuasion. Was missing one of the bolts so I had to use one of the old ones. Not ideal but again, the price was 30% less than anywhere else.<br />Keep in mind when installing this, it is advised to remove or loosen the connecting tube that attaches to intake, connect bottom end to the egr then install the egr valve/ tube assembly,  then re install the upper tube connector at the intake. I have removed and reinstalled this particular unit more times than I care to count and this is the easiest way I have found to get everything to fit together. You should replace the gasket between the tube and valve, it only costs $2-$3 and I have found that they deteriorate more than most gaskets. You will have to judge for yourself. I also replaced the upper tube gasket though the original probably would have been fine. Be careful with the tiny vacuum line that attaches to egr valve from intake boot, you need to reuse it so be gentle removing it. It will snap like a twig if it is cold, I know. That's about it. I fully recommend this product so long as the price remains at such a discount.
B00BDJAYSU|5|Perfect
B007P05FBW|4|Works pretty good on my F-350 tailgate which is quite heavy.  Only downside is the bed extender doesn't fit well since this doesn't allow the tailgate to open completely.
B0041TOQ92|5|Perfect fit for Chevy Volt. Has cut down on musty odor the first time A/C is run in a little while. No noticeable affect on the blower motor speed or airflow.
B00099BJUC|4|Its good paint.
B0024ECIP0|5|Not sure what I expected being 50 amp and 30' but this is a seriously heavy cord of high quality and construction. Now I know why they include a carrying handle. I've used it to extend my electric car cord to a 220 Volt dryer outlet and it didn't heat any of the cords at all. Did very well.
B00K2KCYPW|4|Good price. Once painted, I assembled it and some additional modifications/cuts had to be made. Next time I will just order fairing that have a paint scheme already.
B00VQUXXWA|5|Great block for my backseat baby.
B001TCWLO6|5|Good tool to test the oxigen sensor and define if the replacement is needed.
B0018JVKLU|5|direct fit. bike runs smooth now
B000CB7E10|5|works good
B00VVWTAA2|5|Perfect, works great. Added it to my Eldorado Northstar cooling system.
B008IBLJT4|5|bright leds. good price
B005BT90DI|4|wonderful
B006QLLKAG|1|Although the part portrays itself to fit the grill of a 2007 Ford F150, it did not. I was disappointed in this product description and result.
B000O0P768|5|Fit perfectly on my 2009 Ford Focus and work good too. Easy to replace the previous one that broke. But you do need to hold onto a clip from the original one to secure the new one in place
B00IKRLB1M|5|There's nothing like it for stuck bolts, or reaching deep recesses. It will flow almost anywhere via capillary action.
B003RMV74Q|5|I loved my Dolphin mats. I bought an extra one to go in front of  my kitty litter box. MarleyMay,y cat, loves it too.
B001A4EAV0|5|great tool for filling radiator. Work on trucks and autos
B008E7PYJI|5|Very Happy and Surprised with these Pads.  Every bit as good as the premium brands at a rock bottom price.  Went on without a hitch and work great.  Maybe even quieter then my OEM pads.  Can't see a reason to spend more.  Well done Dura!
B000C2ZKIS|5|Great fit.
B009W85VM8|5|Just what I was looking for! Perfect fit!
B000CC4O58|5|Does the job.
B007W2AS3I|1|They arrived promptly on time, but unfortunately they were very cheap feeling and had a deep scratch all the way across one skeleton hand.
B00AZSPOD0|1|It arrived broken. The gold center piece was separate and it won't stay in the center hole as if it doesn't even fit. Not satisfied.
B00PGRGSH6|5|I've tried a number of different LEDs turn signal option (super bright LEDs,  diode dynamics, vleds) and these blow the competition out of the water.  The vleds are the closest in brightness bit they're almost 3 times the cost. Very visible during the day with the sun swinging right on them and almost blinding at night. I can't say enough positive things about these LEDs.
B00DSD4M7I|4|Very satisfied w/this. Happy w/size of it and delivery time. I may order more at a later date!
B004A2YSA2|5|quick shipping and works great!
B0058J4XBK|1|They stop working after e weeks
B00U117LGO|3|They came w/ &#34;padding&#34; on all 4 sides so when I tried to put them in my 2014 Volvo XC60 , they wouldn't  fit unless the pads were removed.  They should come as is and the pads as a reserve in case it's needed.
B00K9BFI84|4|Pay attention to the size! My fault but so little have to change what I was using them for
B003TQR0V4|5|Exact Match as advertised!!
B00TO7MXG4|5|Good product. Fits my Toyota Matrix perfectly!
B00FAMDC12|5|These beads are amazing and allow me to mount my own tires and not need them balanced using the typical lead weight method.
B000BQYH6Q|5|small, nests well. No problems with a 4 door hatchback on a level concrete slab.
B00HZN955Q|5|Size is perfect & works fine
B004WJPN2A|5|Worked well on caliper pins for two separate brake jobs.
B00B5FLX28|3|It's okay doesn't really hold a ton and I rarely ever use it. I guess as a cargonet it probably could get a 5 but it's a cargonet and do you really need it should be your next question. It seems to be built well and does secure things and has a number of different attachment options/orientations but in honestly I never use it.
B0049Z6VFU|3|First one was bent, second one was fine. I used this in my 66 Chevelle as I put a hydroboost system in and didn't want any issues with the return, so this pump provides a return from the box as well as the hydroboost unit, no T's or anything. Fit perfect has worked well.<br /><br />05/08/2017<br />I'm not sure this really wants to support an active hydro boost user,  it still complains, and at full steering lock it ceases to spin and starts yelling.  I don't have that large of front tires so my grip is not all that great, 245's on 19s, all updated tubular A-arms, coil overs, big sway bars,  I'm looking for something that will handle a bit more pressure.
B001O06BGM|5|great
B00YML13OU|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00HTRTR2O|4|Happy
B0090UN116|5|these look very good at night. the only thing is i had to buy and extension cable because there was no way the rear section would reach the control box. this wasn't a problem, but i wish i would have known this so i could have ordered everything and got it at once. i would definitely recommend these lights to anyone!
B004131JHK|4|seems to be a good part
B0040CW2A0|5|better to have these
B0016LG0CY|3|After buying male crimp on connectors /heat shrink tubing and electrical tape I was able to cut the cord off the 12 volt air compressor slide a piece of shrink tubing over the wires pull the wires apart about one inch on the female connectors connected to cigarette lighter plug  wire  crimp on the male connectors on the cord wires and plug in the male connectors slide shrink tubing over the connectors and heat with shrink tubing with lighter until it melts enough to fit over the connectors and wire tight I put electrical tape over the wires about one inch after where I split the wires wrapped it on wires and the heat shrink tubing until both ends looked the same,
B000FA91DC|5|This is the vent cover only. It is bright white, not off-white. It is made of a supple plastic, not the brittle hard stuff. That is, it seemed much more flexible than the one I removed, but that could have been the result of UV exposure. I watched 2 YouTube videos on doing this replacement before attempting it myself. The most difficult part was getting up on top of my camper, as I have no attached ladder. This is a 5 minute replacement with 2 people or 10 minutes with 1 person, particularly if you are without a ladder to the top of your camper. It was really easy to replace. I used this vent cover to replace a Heng's vent cover that I broke when I was clearing snow off the top. The package says it fits other brands. I measured my old vent and looked at how it was attached to determine if this was the right cover- and it was! It works perfectly! There are no instructions with the cover, so you'll have to inform yourself by other means.
B003JBGFM4|5|Great product, and decent price (I almost cut mine too short (oops)), but luckily I had messed up somewhere else so was totally in the clear :) hahahah<br /><br />I moved my 66 Chevelle from a rod to this cable, I like it, it's cleaner as well.
B001LHVOVK|5|This device worked perfectly for reading & clearing a non-crucial code in order to pass our Emissions Test.
B00D7HZ6FC|5|Revived a couple MH batteries, showing about 11 volts.  It took several days, but they are holdin6 12.6 after several days. tried a couple that were too far gone without success.  Used on a weak car battery and after one night it has more power.
B00KHUQGGA|4|It is as the description. The dye on the product come off on your hand and clothes in the first week of use.
B00NAQOVF6|2|positioning on your ear so that it really beeps with a 15-20 degree motion , is very tricky, not always reliable.
B005NLQAHS|2|It doesn't work with my Samsung Galaxy S5.
B00TPVD1WY|4|Fits great. Tightning screws a little cheap. Easy to round out.
B00CS7T0IQ|5|nice!
B003G0KBUK|5|Nice mats easy install easy maintenance just rinse and reinstall
B00CB8WM2S|5|Must have. Does save lives.
B00E1SP1GU|5|Perfect fit for my 98 camaro, arrived fast and look so sharp,hubby says easy to install, I am a happy wife
B00K86R6J4|5|Nice, durable valve stem core removers. Easy to grip.
B00T7GYDTC|5|Bad ass super bright and easy to install.
B00CZEZNGU|3|The light works good, easy to install.  The lens covers are junk, 2 of the 3 I ordered were broken upon delivery.
B008R0ZSR0|4|Love the removable waterproof liner! it gets way too hot if you don't need it so take it out when possible.  I kinda worry about the mesh holding up in a crash.  It looks good and has nice armor on the elbows and back.  No chest protection though and the shoulder armor seems to have a bit more movement than I would like.  Cant complain too much. i do like it and i haven't crashed yet to test it. I pray I don't, I pray you don't either!
B008GUESF4|5|These have worked without issue for 2 years now. Easier to replace all ten than to try and figure out which ones aren't working properly.
B000C1DZUE|5|Easy to install and works perfect. So far, so good. I recommend this part even if you have to bend one of the hose connections to get it to fit.
B00HQZB4I4|4|We love the fan! I am not sure if we received returned merchandise because we hooked it up and did not work. My husband had to take it apart and wires inside were not hooked up correctly and one of the fans had electrical tape on the inside where the automatic fan hooks up. But we got it straightened out and they work now.
B000C7QMGM|5|This tank, Spectra F8E, is the one with the smaller sending unit hole.  For my '88 Bronco with the 5.8L this was the correct size.  If you need the bigger one you'll need the F8D.<br /><br />You'll want to drain as much of the fuel out as possible from the old tank.  Easiest thing is drive your vehicle until its low on fuel.  I tried using a liquid transfer pump but it died after 2 pumps as did its replacement.  So simply trying to transfer the gas that way won't work.  Maybe you can siphon it with a suitable hose.<br /><br />The basic process is easy... drop the skid plate, drop the tank, new tank, lift the skid plate, and bolt it back up.  The issue is there are connections on the top of the tank and the fuel fill hose is connected.<br /><br />If you cut an access panel above the sender and fuel return that makes disconnecting those super simple but you have to be very careful doing this.  Otherwise you'll want to use a jack and support the tank and lower it enough to reach.  On the fuel filler a hose clamp holds the filler neck on as do 3 machine screws around the fill port.<br /><br />When lifting the new tank/skid plate use a jack and scrap wood to help position everything for re-assembly.  Again, if you don't have an access panel you'll need to re-connect everything first.<br /><br />Having a helper will definitely be useful.
B005NLQAHS|5|Good items!
B00E43TEV0|4|Look great wish they would last longer.
B011CEVVAU|5|I bought this for my husband who farms and he loves it, really got his hands clean!
B00PM9PLXA|5|Very happy with this &#34;universal&#34; set! Fits front seats of a Dodge Durango (2005) VERY well!
B000EQ74KY|1|I picked up two of these cables at my local Advance Autoparts store for convenience (approx. $15 each).  The fitment is terrible for my 2002 Toyota Tacoma and I expect the same for many other years because this is Needa's replacement cable for all 95-03 Tacomas as verified by their website.<br /><br />The main problem is the thickness of the material used at each end of the cables.  It is much thicker than stock.  Most people would think this a plus but you absolutely cannot use the plastic washers on either end as you would with your OEM cables or it will not fit.  See my picture for a side by side comparison.  Look at the OEM bolt.  See how a small portion of the bolt extends beyond the cable ring?  That extension is what is torqued down to the side of your truck so that the cable has a small amount of wiggle room that is necessary for the cable to spin freely when you open and close your tailgate.  This clearance is absent if you use a plastic washer with the Needa cable.<br /><br />I had the same issue with the end that mounts to your tailgate. There is a plastic OEM washer (that does not come with this kit) and it would not allow this cable to spin freely as it's supposed to.<br /><br />The biggest problem with these cables however is the bend on the side that mounts to the tailgate.  See my picture for a side by side.  The bend on the Needa is so severe and sticks out so far that I could not close my tailgate without it scratching the paint.<br /><br />Maybe you will have better luck.  I returned these though and bought a pair of Dorman Part #38531 from Amazon and those worked perfectly.
B0034U9IEM|4|This power cord appears to be very good quality. Time will tell because it's made in China and I have had horrible experiences with neoprene or the like made there. The quality has been terrible with other items, so I will have to see how this one turns out. (I'm talking about the cord covering. The inside wires appear to be copper and look OK.)<br /><br />I am sorry that I ordered the 15 foot version, however. It is just a tad too short for many setups and I wish I had ordered the 25 foot cord. It wouldn't have weighed all that much more and would have been more useful.
B0068FUU4C|5|As Advertised.
B000C04C5C|5|Great as advertised.
B008R0ZXPC|4|Very nice jacket. Fits very snug, so order a size up if you want to be able to wear other items under it.
B000CIAWLM|5|This item was an exact fit. I was very satisfied with the flywheel. my clutch performs great after installing this flywheel with it. The price is unbeatable. I couldn't find the flywheel for less than $350 anywhere in my area. I only paid $350 all together for the LuK flywheel and LuK clutch kit. It arrived much sooner than I expected.
B000C2WDR4|5|All good
B002UC4XJ0|4|Worked out good
B002QEFIPU|4|works just like OEM
B000NVW1LM|5|I had a 1999 ranger with a 3.0 that had a slow leak from the rear main seal and the trans output shaft seal. Not huge leaks but stopped altogether and saved me much time and money! Also worked on my x5 and Volvo 240. Good thing to use as a preventative maintenance item on old cars. Cheap insurance!
B00O4CV2B6|5|t's been on my keys for over a month. Dropped them multiple times, I always cram the keys in my pocket and it still looks like the day I got it. (See picture)
B00CSY1UMS|2|In order to have the notebook monitor have good angle to back seat passenger, you need to have your passenger seat up straight.<br />or need to put some cushion between the backside of 1st row seat and this laptop tray so one can view the monitor.<br />I used small pillow to put behind this tray so that I can angle up the monitor.
B000WJF4HS|5|Great Product and great service..
B0085LO2NW|1|Sùckes first time I used it it was blowing out sparks from the brushes  not pleased would not tell anyone to by one and I know a lot people who ride been riding for 40 years
B00T5GXU8E|5|Great product
B00X569GS8|5|Excellent quality plastic molded inserts for your Jeep's grill slots. Thick but not excessively so. No physical modification necessary to my stock 2010 Jeep Wrangler Islander grill to mount these. Be certain to clay bar the mounting surfaces and then wipe down with alcohol to remove all traces of wax, silicones, and polish to achieve max bonding to vehicle. Used clean microfiber towels to do final cleaning prior to mounting. Took approximately 35-45 minutes to mount these in 80F weather!
B001OMVCN2|5|I had this installed for me, so can't comment on how easy that was.  But, I can say it works great and I love the wireless feature.  I also like the manual backup filling feature.<br />I bought this for my 78 F150 to haul a slide in camper.  It was just the ticket.
B00GJISQVC|2|I have it, but doesn't work I went to  locks Smith for the programing,  they don't have the 2013 program. So I buy it for nothing
B00B02PXYK|5|Love it!  That's all that needs to be said.
B00SR4FJ7K|4|works as described
B0000AYFUW|5|Nice wire
B007W7TC94|5|This has worked great for the 18 months I've had it. Unless you have a Chamberlain opener, you need the model with the power supply. I plugged that into a socket adapter where one of my bulbs was on my Genie opener. The laser only stays on while the opener light is on. I don't see why it won't work for decades in that configuration.
B004KEHG04|5|lost my original set and got these as a replacement. works great
B003D4O9DY|5|Put this muffler on my sr20DE. It sounds beautiful. Considering my last muffler was a 125 dollar MagnaFlow I had very low standards for this. When it arrived I was Impressed. Very happy with this muffler
B00U36ASNA|5|Finally got my headlights looking good again. Thank you!
B0002Z9QO4|2|Developed a wear hole where it rubbed against a rack bar and flapped in the wind. Straps work good, zipper worked good, fabric wore through.
B00BSUE80O|5|Look cool
B0031XHYWA|5|Fixed the refrigerator in our camper. Works great. Great price
B003VWFJCS|2|To me there was an unpleasant odor and I returned them.
B0073WEZU4|4|I swapped the factory antenna with the Stubby Antenna because the original factory antenna was hitting the top of my garage door. There was a slight reduction in both AM and FM signals but reception is still good for this area. The product is well worth the money.

B008BR6UKI|5|Excellent replacement for my G37.  Exactly the same as the OEM, made by the same company.
B008ND6QC2|3|Does not fit Nissan Armada Platinum doors. Not the company's fault. They were extremely flexible in trying to get the correct part for my vehicle.
B00OGN85UO|1|Wasn't right axle, Polaris makes 2 different ones for that year. Had to pay return and wasn't refunded my complete amount. Not impressed

B008IK507W|5|Product listed was received and worked well.
B00HDMEUCW|5|This product is awesome! My seat stays clean in my car after super sweaty runs or tennis! It doesn't slip around like a towel. I bought a hot pink for me & black for my husband.
B003COQAFU|5|Love my Superwinch!  Has gotten me out of a tough spot!  Used it on Polaris 400.
B000GUWVD8|5|Easy to install and so far great
B007XE8C74|5|This will save me a lot of time and trouble in the future. I put a lot of miles on one of my vehicles and of course it takes its toll. This reader helps me stay on top of the small issues before they become big issues .
B00YG3PZDE|5|Price is right, fit is right, can afford to buy several sets at a time. Good utility, no-need-to-be-flashy, grips.
B005BNP7UO|1|This item seems fine for basic installations buy my 2015 Ford F-150, Lariat w/ tow package and option 501a group that has a back-up camera and guidance sensors with integrated brake controller thinks there is a trailer hooked up when the LED Hitch Light is installed. Then other functions like the Blind Spot System are disengaged also.
B007YVPDWI|4|Exacty what I expected  Looks great
B008IJNSTK|5|this fit directly on an Echo PB-260L backpack blower.  The only thing that was different from the OEM is that this one had a Hi speed adjustment screw that was easily accessible.  Put it on fired right up and idled great. 1 qtr. turn on the hi speed jet and I was back in business.  I took measurements of the OEM carb before purchasing this so I was sure it was the right fit per seller information.
B00E0HKD6U|1|Absolute garbage they will fall apart within 5 miles, the threads will strip out, because they are aluminum threads.
B004I0FZZ8|5|Worked as expected
B001PLNDF2|5|Not sure if anybody else has posted about it, but Teflon tape is certainly needed. Leaks otherwise.<br />I used a 1 1/16&#34; box-end wrench to tighten the adapter.
B003U4O414|5|It works.  My MPG went up 12 %.
B0026MASK2|1|Hose nozzle snapped off. Garbage
B004PHDLQY|5|great cleaner, quickly evaporates, effective and easy to use
B00QIEVI4E|1|JUNK DIDNT EVEN WORK !
B008G1Z9GK|5|I swapped out my old side markers to match my new headlamps also from Autodart.<br />Were a perfect match an fit.<br />Crystal clear lenses made a huge difference in appearance.<br />Packaged very securely in study boxes with plenty of padding.<br />Freshened up to look of my trusty Cavalier.
B004H78NQ0|5|BMW need I say more?
B001CF1A6U|4|Extremely well built and the price was much better than local box store
B00YHZ47O4|5|Everything was there and explore runs great and quiet
B001FAO8I4|1|This was a harible pump. The first time I used it was on my daughters little bike and it broke. It was cheap, but not worth buying.
B0045WBVUM|5|Makes riding a pleasure again!
B004OK7FVY|2|Not as advertised . I have cheaper product that performs equally if not better
B00ACGI1GW|1|Not good I lost my money glue it is not holding them
B00KQ3WR1G|5|On time and as expected.
B00RDMBTNA|4|I got two. They were comfortable to wear, easy to use and did a great job washing the car! A first rate product and supplier.
B00LRSP55Y|5|As described.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|This product arrived on time and packaged nicely. It works as advertised and the price seems below some of the others I have found. I tried it out on a ride yesterday and it charged my phone completely on the ride.
B000IYE35Q|5|Great shocks !
B00E1SLKGA|3|The rotors look to be better quality than the oem rotors that these are replacing. The cooling slots were bright and free from any casting sand or slag, the machine work looked to be first class. The only things that were done to the rotors was cleaning, checking runout, and putting on the swirl polish with a small grinder and sticky back pad. The pads looked good as well but started to squeal after they were broken in well and sometimes even shudder during low speed low foot pressure braking. I will have them replaced with Raybestos Professional Grade or TRW pads
B0013REXO8|5|Great product!
B00I96JZU8|4|Installed on an old Yamaha XS750.  Excellent output, and is holding a charge well...
B007AHH7CK|5|Seems kinda dim in the daytime on low so I bought the led trim light to go with it. On high it will blind you.lol
B002NAMNXM|5|Great replacement headlights for 1997 Dodge Intrepid.
B00126IDDC|1|This inverter was DOA. It displayed strange symbols on the LED readout and didn't produce any usable power. Unfortunately, I had waited too long between purchasing the unit and testing it, so I was unable to return it. If you do buy this inverter, don't make my mistake - take it out of the box and test it immediately (it would probably be wise to run it for an extended period to fully test it). This way you can return it if something goes wrong.
B00E1WNH6W|1|Not enough pressure to fully engage bike ... need to be a higher pass valve for the fluid.
B008EEYTTM|5|good
B00062YILO|5|Fits 98 4runner and works well.
B00KCZMXIA|5|Fits perfectly.  Just like when car came from the dealer.
B00MU5X17M|5|Fit my 09 Silverado and works great so far
B00WMPUUS8|1|Really was damage , i never bye Again because  i can not use that
B008CE070E|5|Solid hitch at a great price, heavy.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Works well. Forgot it was there and tried to back up car. Couldn't.
B00TEG0OR0|5|Great product. Wish it came as a two-pack, one of the stickers facing the opposite direction though
B007K294DA|3|They look good, not sure if I like the fact that they stick out the side a little.  Just a different look
B00HE1BQTM|5|This was a great find for me! It has the back already on it with the clips and it fit perfectly!
B005VUP1A8|5|Perfect fit!!
B004RPUXI8|5|They really look nice on my Sea Ray.
B00M0O2KES|3|I thought it was a good deal but arriving with NO padding in the package, nine of the twelve lights got turned on and arrived with dead batteries. Three each, that's 27 wasted AAA batteries.
B00LWGFWRC|5|This light is so bright over our rear license plate you can almost back up with only it :)
B00496491C|5|The Best Brakes On The Market.
B000WJA5ZY|4|great shipper and quality
B005GSFK6U|5|Allowed for a professional looking installation.
B005GYDBNS|5|I think this is a very good filter for the money. Use with Mobil1 synthetic oil all the time.
B000UVCK9S|4|These lights work pretty well. I wish that they were brighter. Work well, other than that, and haven't had any issues with them yet.
B0007N57LM|4|Works great. Easy to install just which it comes in a longer size. I had to order two.
B00CGCO0NS|5|Got it on time and my husband was thrilled!
B00WUO80Y2|5|Great
B00JCIE2YG|5|when i got this it took some work to get it to fit had to use a small piece of tin metal to make it fit tight. works great for my application.
B00407TUG4|5|For what this is (paint in an aerosol can) it matches up very very closely. Worked great for touching up my bumper where paint had started to peel. I used this on a 2010 Honda Civic and for what I paid for it (the paint), it looks much better. If you're going to apply this to a dark surface multiple coats will be required. Follow the directions on the can and you're good to go. If you start skipping steps or modifying the execution of instructions, you're going to be one of those people that leave a bad review. Can says it covers 10-12 square feet. I just touched up.
B00PBC2ODI|3|they look nice .  I have not  put them on the  van  yet  .I have not  have  time to do it  I will lest you no
B00JIVRV2W|5|Installed easily and looks great!!!
B00OU2HIUY|1|Does not work
B00HQEXHLC|5|Exactly what was needed.  Installs easily and looks great!
B00695Q3P6|5|09/12/2015  I love it, it really does come in handy, you will see in another image that it doesn't fit the steering wheel, my car (Honda Accord 90-93) did the exact same thing, that is because it was right side up. I flipped my wheel up side down and it was much more level.  P.S. I have my steering wheel cover on too
B00HJ15H4C|5|Nice seat cover met my expectations
B00GPJPC1C|5|Perfect.
B00LTXP23C|4|These are about the best option out there for towing mirrors on the Chevy Express van.  You can buy mirrors designed for box vans / rv's but they are over triple the price,  not very useful when you're not towing, and the prices is a LOT more if you want to keep the power option.  I'll buy again if I need to replace unless there is another option out there at the time.  These seem pretty sturdy so hope it wont come to that.[[ASIN:B00LTXP23C Longview (LVT-1700) Towing Mirror]]
B000VKTUE6|5|What can I say about an airfilter?  It fits.  It works.  It is perfectly normal and fine.  No problems.
B00JEGDU6W|5|Excelent
B003ZJOFG8|5|installed and works great
B00LNOUUZM|5|Very nice looking easy to assemble about 15 min. Fast shipping would strongly recommend
B007IW6WPU|5|Worked just fine. Easy to install.
B000BLKV9S|5|Great!
B00OL92L6M|4|Good product, good, quick delivery. Go Steelers!!!!!! Climbing The Stairway To 7!!!!!! ✨🏈🐝
B00UO6GKZY|5|This box is awesome, sturdy and well made. The lock system is solid. The lid is ~¼ inch bigger than the bottom, which, if placed on the tongue of a trailer, like is my intention, dirt will get in it. I got a 1¼ inch wide foam tape (weather stripping) from Home Depot, put it around the inside of the lid's &#34;ceiling&#34; and voilá, a perfect seal!
B003VFCKR2|4|Works great!<br />Keeps you out of the sun if that's what you want.<br />Easy to put up and take down, also packs away small.
B00CKW17NK|5|Great!
B000CPCC3Q|5|exactly what we needed
B000EQ80JI|1|My mechanic informed me that one of the strut mounts was missing a bearing. They've already taken apart my struts and I could not wait for another few days to get a replacement. Missing components definitely violates safety issues for a vehicle.
B00NSA37UO|5|This so adorable. Haven't put it on my car window yet but I love it. Thank you
B00LEBLI82|4|Work well very good I'm very pleased with the items
B0093XZDS4|4|seems to make the motor run smoother. have not yet been able to check gas mileage yet.
B000HBM80M|5|Different name but the same stuff I have been using for years basically a medium grit that breaks down to a fine grit as you lap the valves
B000C92YZS|2|my rating is because the shoes didnt fit my 2000 JEEP CHEROKEE CLASSIC as stated. Returning them is not an option since I had them shipped to Colombia where I live
B0002UQAY8|5|holding up well after a few polishes. No complaints here.
B00INVEQKI|5|What I wanted.
B00JIDZJOC|3|This is really big.  Didn't use due to that.
B004MUI7OA|5|item works great, easy plug in on my accord.
B00M78820I|5|I love how easy, convenient, and well made of this sunshade.  Unfortunately, my car's windshield is beyond jumbo.  It sort of works, just a tad small to lay flat against the windshield. (See pictures)<br /><br />Bearded Garage is a great company, they have professional and impeccable customer service, and they go above and beyond to help me with my 'situation'!  I will be a customer for life, and I would recommend to anyone and everyone.  Keep up the good work, Josie and Charles!
B000SKV4U2|5|great oil recommend if you feel you're over thinking which one to buy.
B000MXZHUI|3|I have used shop rags over the years to do the same job. Maybe I'm just stuck in old habits but I would not but these again.
B0058FFCDC|5|I replaced the kitchen faucet in my RV with the dura faucet kitchen faucet and it works flawlessly
B00P922Y58|5|Perfect on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler and Fast Shipping
B000PUIEB2|5|Easy to use and leave on the generator without using a 15A neck down.
B00IUV7YNW|2|Battery worked good but would not hold a charge. i had to recharge every day or two. The display is an awesome feature. I used the battery for 7 days and it says &#34;0 days&#34; for days used on display. I might have gotten a defect. I received refund and will reorder in hopes of a good battery.
B00BFDH8YC|5|OEM item.  Keep an eye out for warehouse deals, mine was $18 because it was missing a box or sticker.
B00I9280FS|5|Great seat caddy
B009GO6CYO|4|Very easy setup, but I used it three times and the internal circuit breaker tripped and did not reset for at lease 30 minutes. This product was advertised at 4500 pounds which is almost half again the weight of my camper. And I have about 350 pound tongue weight. Although very reasonably priced compared to others I felt my camper should not have overloaded it.
B00GJMDTH4|1|Wonky! They don't always work unless you make sure they're not touching and even then they are not 100%. If you make 100% sure then be prepared to have to really fiddle w/ them to reconnect the screw back in there,,,pain!. A big dissappointment for someone who has these down in a battery compartment w/out 20-20 vision who can't possibly lean down into said compartment to check of they are touching or not. I would never mess w/ these again but i already have them. The second time i returned to the RV knowing i had disconnected them properly but the batteries has again run down! Well,,,when you have the tiniest bit of temperature changes,,,the cable apparently expanded/contracted and make the terminal connection anyway *&^%$#@!!!!!!! I have used some of these type connectors before and don't recall having such problems? I'm not sure if these are just cheaply made or not? I will never use this type of connector again. Going perko switch or some cole hersey, etc. next time!
B007ZDG2HK|5|Great as advertised.
B009YKYCV0|5|Awesome, I'm liking it!
B004YKAG9W|5|good product
B00027GXNE|5|Works great
B00CSVCNW2|5|Attaches to the corkscrew securely and works as advertised..
B001DRLPTE|5|Good items!
B003AH8I0O|5|I get looks every time LOL People crack up when they see it.  Good quality too.
B00UUVMJYO|5|works as planned
B00MZ55ANU|5|How great to have these replacements!! Thumbs up!!
B005JU5W54|5|Clings very well to curvy windshield of CX-7.  Wipes well.  Longevity TBD.
B001ODAT26|5|works great thanks!
B00KTHQR0Q|5|Programmed 2 of them in under a minute and are working just fine.  Beats the dealers cost anyday
B0041K6X9M|3|I give it a three star because it does not have strings on the bottom to keep it in place. When the passanger seat is reclined the organizer hangs and bothers the person on the back seat.
B004PL4H0O|5|These are perfect for what we needed. We carry 2x6 and 2x4 lumber on our 2013 Honda pilot roof top carrier and always had problems with the tie downs. These straps solved all of our problems. They are easy to use and remove easily. We are very satisfied.
B00480J4KA|5|exactly as described
B0068M2D68|5|I took a chance ordering it to replace a fog light that was broken by a stone on my 2007 Mustang w/Pony package, since it did not specifically say it would work. It appeared to be the same as the original.  I am glad that it did since it was $20+ less expensive than Ford. When it arrived, I was happy to see that it was identical to the OE installed as part of the 'Pony package' option. Took about 30 minutes to replace the broken one.
B007VXV6AM|5|Looks great. Delivered on time
B0002S9X2Q|5|Awesome seat covers, water resistant and wipes clean
B000P3WW12|5|Perfect mount. It can be used the way it looks in the picture or turned upside down if the trailer is too low to the ground.
B0024ECHII|2|Does not match up to steps will need to work on this more. Bolts are somewhat small and may need to replace.
B00HTS9MEG|5|I put this on my kayak and his has held up to the elements very well.
B00K9553GW|5|perfect for the job
B002UC2V26|5|No problem, exact replacement.
B006BE0ZBS|3|The works and was able to be progammed however the photo is inaccurate. The actual hole for the key ring is small compared to what is shown in the photo.
B0017OFS3C|5|Works just fine, exact replacement.
B00QI031X4|5|Nice item.  As described.  Has VW logo on it.
B0031I4HNE|5|Purchased these to replace the original rear rotors on my 2005 Suburban 1500 Z71 with about 145k miles on it.  These are a direct OEM replacement and fit without issue.  Performance has been fine and braking is very smooth and quiet.
B000BR51SI|4|A little messy but makes for a good seal with no leakage
B000E5U4O8|5|Fit our Audi A3 TDI perfect!
B00651CLCS|5|Look great. Doesn't affect my FM reception. Looks a lot better than that 3 foot floppy antenna that came on my Jeep.
B00CJ5DZE2|3|The plastic master cylinder adapter isn't cut well.  Tons of loose plastic on that piece that can potentially fall in your brake reservoir if you don't clean it properly before use.  Also, don't expect this thing to be leak free on a Nissan.  The Motive held pressure to a degree, but slowly bled off 1 psi every few minutes or so.  Kinda annoying tool to work with, but I guess it got the job done.  Meh.
B0089C4IG8|5|Fits well.
B000JFHNG0|4|Works as expected great deal.
B004TOB6EW|4|It serves the purpose, but you can't get all the grey water out of the tank. Therefore, you have left over water that stays in the tank and starts to smell.
B0019C17H8|1|Did not fit my 96 Honda civic lx very cheep I guess you get what you pay for. You are better off spending the extra money to get a real one
B000ANOUHQ|5|Perfect as seat protector and will be cozy warm in winter.
B00UM9X4UW|5|No problems! Comes with 1/8&#34; NPT fitting just like it should to fit the sandwich adapter. Works great for temporary testing. Wouldn't run an oil line into my dashboard.
B007TXZ48Y|2|Light is fine, but the polarity on the wiring was reversed so the light would not work (these are LEDs so the correct polarity is required).  Anyway, I was able to use the wires from the old light (the Dorman OE Solutions 923-203 that I purchased in Aug 2013 that only lasted about 12 months before failing).  Lesson learned, if you want something that works out of the box and will last for many years spend the money on the OE part and skip the cheap aftermarket versions.  BTW:  This is not a reflection on the vendor I purchased from, AUTOANDART shipped it quick and did a great job as far as I am concerned, the quality of the light isn't their fault.
B000WJEPCI|2|i dont own this but i give a 5 star for just the idea.<br /><br />its a good idea to copy there product but with much better quality stuff.<br />just buy all the things this thing has and make yourself a CUSTOM wooden case or box and creatively put all these higher quality products inside.
B007WPBZUU|5|Top tier company. Great price, great performance.
B000AUU6R2|4|I ended up not needing this because the exhaust is so quiet anyway. If you buy this you will be silent.
B000IYSHY4|3|Quality is good, however make sure that this fits your vehicle before ordering. The description here doesn't accurately specify what this fits. This mirror DOES NOT fit 2001-2002 Supercrew models. There's a big difference in the size of the mirror and the mounting holes between the Supercrew and the rest of the F150 models. If your looking for a Supercrew mirror this isn't it. Thankfully Amazon made it easy to return. A+ for Amazon!
B00LW6O8X6|5|It fit perfectly on my 95 Ford Explorer Sport. With a lot of hard work and tucking in this product fit nicely. It's still a bit lose but it's not bad. In the back seats I had to unzip most of the leather and use the thin fabric in order to make it fit nicely.
B0002LJQMA|5|Accept no substitutes. I use this on really high end classics including Concours collector vehicles. Really lets the fragrance of the leather come through and leaves the surface soft. Seriously good stuff. The hide cream is superb.
B00O83MHNI|5|Nicely built and assembled. Sealed very well have driven thru several rain storms and a few hundred miles and still good to go.
B0031G8GME|5|Avoid the over-priced Subaru version (quoted $110.00 from Heuberger) when this top of the line Curt plug-in does it better.
B002EW5G2O|3|We just got a new 2015 camper this year and camped a total of 30 days so far this summer. I hate to say it but I only cleaned it once and that was last week of course test this stuff to see how it would work and it did not impress me. It faded some of the bug and soot spots but didn't completely remove all of them (Other spots it didn't even touch). I think carnauba wash I purchased could have done a better job but I wasn't sure if that was ok to use on an awning?
B0023075SA|5|Great. Thanks
B009BGRIRM|5|fits well thank you and at a cheaper price than auto parts stores
B0006303O4|5|&#34;I BROUGHT THIS AS A GIFT AND PERSON JUST LOVES IT.&#34;
B0002JN3GC|2|The wiper blades were easy to attach, and worked well for ~3 months. After that, the wiper blades began to noticeably streak, and is getting progressively worse. The streaking is not improved after cleaning the wiper blade and windshield. The price difference between this brand and other (Rain-X, Bosch) are not so great that it makes this a better deal. In fact, many of the competitor prices are actually slightly cheaper.
B010MHV00O|5|AMAZING!  This works perfectly in my 2010 Chevy Traverse.  I have a 32 oz Bubba mug that I carry to work everyday.  I had no where to sit it in my car.  The BottlePro allows my cup to sit snug in the cup holder and it is SO nice having it in there.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BOTTLE PRO
B00LDNGLIS|5|great lights.. customer service with these guys are the best.. helped me out every time.. great guys
B0010DZZPG|4|What can I say....its an aftermarket replacement for oem filters that cost nearly twice as much as this one.  Have used Fram filters for 40 years without any problems.
B0030B2N10|2|The electric/12V plug in did not work on the first one I received. It was replaced and after a year the second one also quit working. This feature was never used only checked.
B00NE6J1OS|5|This should be a factory decal, it matches perfect.
B002UC2V26|5|Exact fit for 1999 Bounder. Great price and easy install. If you need this, buy it and you won't be disappointed.
B000CIGE9G|5|Easy to install and keeps the 42RLE in my '09 JKU much cooler.  Highly recommended to extend the life of your transmission!
B011ERI1NA|5|Great quality and prices!!!!
B00LGOXOZ2|1|A few days ago I bought this product and I honestly do not waste your time or your money
B00J0FT5P2|5|Good quality sticker!
B00FADJ06C|5|This rear wiper blade is, in fact, an exact fit without any adapters, at a better price than OEM from the VW dealer.
B00080QHMM|4|works as advertised. this is my 2nd accutire . my 10 year one reads the same as new one. got for wife..
B000CPI5YG|5|Great stuff! After tons of research I discovered that this CAN be used in the Subaru WRX STi 6MT gearbox. Its suggested that you mix 2L of this with 1.5L (top off the gearbox) with Motul 300. I did this and its flawless!
B00EC0Z4XM|5|good
B008EG66BO|5|perfect fit for my 2013 Sienna.  Not noticing gas saving, yet.
B00ONDM07G|4|Fit and finish is great.  It's perfect for holding your GPS. The screw rattled to much for shooting video.
B0062IJOJ2|1|Not satisfied. It came beat to crap, missing parts for installation and two days after the delivery date that I paid an extra 21.50 for. I do not recommend this to anyone. Plus it didn't fit like they claimed it would and we had to drill new holes in the body. Waste of money.
B004GCDTGU|5|Great fit made the front of my Blazer look like new even without painting. It goes with the the black undercoating that I used on my frame to look as if it was the way that it came from the factory
B007TY06JA|3|The motor failed after 1 day. I was not pleased. I used the old OEM motor and replaced it with the defective new one.<br />I ordered the entire Power Window Lift Regulator because the cable was broken on the original. The rails and cable were fine as not much<br />can go wrong with parts void of electrical components. I would have sent this part back if I were not pressed for time and fortunately for me the original motor was in good working order.<br /><br />This type of thing happens from time to time............
B00DBEPIX6|1|did not work
B000COVQ3Y|5|A high quality muffler clamp, what else can you say.
B00429NKWK|4|More work than I thought but headlights came out very good.
B000NJ6EZ8|5|Applied 2 days ago - Easy to apply and looks good so far, no more rubbing noise when moving the slide out. I am a little worried about how long the can will last though. It felt like the first application might have used up about half of the can. However,  I did do inside and outside rubber gaskets on a slide out thats about 6' tall and about 10' long???
B00HVHYP60|4|This keyfob condom fixed the issue was having where the 2 pieces wouldnt stay together after dropping it to many times.  Also makes it a lot quicker/easier to find in a purse due to the bright color.
B00278MDFS|4|This is the recommended filter for my generator.  Why would I use anything else?
B008BRJ5FA|5|As advertised.
B000CCDN3C|3|Great sound and noticeable power increase.  If you are looking for a loud exhaust, this isn't the one.  I was looking for a noticeable sound change, which this does.  It is not overpowering and to me is almost perfect.  Now, the reason for the 3 stars.....the passenger side tail pipe female end is too large in diameter and won't bolt down because it is too loose.  Also note that if you have the air ride suspension, you will need to get creative because the driver side hanger is supposed to use the hole the compressor is using.  I was able to loosen the compressor bolt and put the hanger between the frame and the compressor.
B007O21J84|5|Sounds awesome!!
B00NSG5BKC|5|I own two of these they're awesome these people who write reviews with all these problems you obviously did something wrong when you installed it they run perfect i will buy another one soon!
B004BHZR1A|5|Exactly what I wanted.  And it's been stuck to my fenders on my truck this far.
B00WGSDP42|5|Works fine
B00C8E9CMS|5|Good
B00H7LPKKU|5|Just what my husband wanted for Father's Day. Great tool!
B002LFAQGU|2|Would not fit over the exhaust pipe that it was supposed to.
B00I61XPP2|5|I love this License Plate Frame lol
B000N8QP26|5|Perfect. However found it cheaper at Walmart
B007TD1WIK|5|Arrived right away & has a case with instructions printed on it. (Great for the new driver in the house)
B001VZN6ZO|5|This one works much better than the hyper tech programmer that I had before. Better gains all around
B00KTHXRLS|5|Easy to program! Easy to Program...works! No issues!
B0080L5HBS|5|Just wanted a reusable filter rather than a paper one. This is just what I was looking for.
B00B0QO90U|2|did not hold up
B00F3XFWAW|5|Awesome! Would love to submit photo but the option disappeared boo!...TwistedGypsy
B00OYR8N7M|5|better than expected......easy installation. no issues, works as advertised.
B00BDVM8P0|5|Nice job!
B001O0HM4C|5|I love the fact that each lug nut is like its own lock.  It is understandable that if a person wants to steal your rims they will do whatever it takes, but this makes it that much harder.  Usually when a person looks to steal they want an easy target, and since every lug is basically a lock, it's no longer that easy.  These lugs are a very nice quality build, and come with a hard anodized black color that resists chipping.
B006UH5AAC|5|Great
B000CAINRK|4|Love the softness
B0009VIQ1A|4|Doesn't stay clean very long, seems to spread the dirt more than pick it up.
B000IYKVLQ|5|I have been a fan of Raybestos rotors for older domestic cars and these are as expected. Nice machining, perfect alignment.
B00CPL8PSG|5|great product
B001VC3UGC|4|work fine but when ship box was torn open and parts missing had to use part from old winch
B004HMBK5G|5|excellent price,good product and arrived much sooner than expected.
B001UFRUWU|5|did exactly what i needed  very pleased
B003UT6LCO|5|Installs simply during a normal oil change and makes subsequent changes so much faster, easier and cleaner. I recommend these valves to anyone who does their own oil changes.
B00DX882QK|4|Looks like it would work but mine came stock with an o ring so I reused the old o ring and held onto this part ....just in case.
B000CGEJ6S|5|fits as described.
B000E4PVY2|5|Fit perfectly and very easy to install
B0082365AQ|5|I am not one to do a review before I had a considerable time using the product that I'm doing the review for, I read a good number of reviews posted on this item everybody complains about the stink of the little tiny red tires well go to Walmart and stand in the Service center you have the same smell it's in the tires get over it, furthermore if the little tires don't hold air it's from China get over it, being you're at Walmart smelling tires buy a small bottle of  green slim used for tire with inner tubes, As for the strap that is supplied with your little cart I don't care for it I found it easier using one of my well used ratchet straps, As for the overall quality I find it quite adequate for 100 pound kayak, now here is the real deal I am 67 years old I have an old town tandem kayak 76 pounds empty I loaded up I set it on my little cart just behind the centerpoint that gives me about 5 pounds of tongue weight, loaded up the whole package is near 100 pounds, I can maneuver the kayak anywhere I want to overhill and overdale and the kayak doesn't fall off,
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great! Stores nicely and isn't hard to fit back into its pouch - doesn't have to be exact.
B00L5GW5RO|5|Great product. Just need to mark left side and right side for faster set up,
B001GRWDC4|3|I have a 2014 premium enclave and the front windows are a perfect fit.  The rear windows do not fit properly and we cannot roll the rear windows down without having problems with putting the windows back up... we are going to remove the rear window ones because they are very problematic
B00DF7CGES|5|Great mud gaurds easy to install just need better fasteners for bottom back
B000C59UZY|5|Works great
B00OJ4ZYY0|5|Exactly what I expected
B007R0XD46|3|Looks good and a great price. Fast shipping too.<br /><br />The problem is the radio reception is terrible after install. If you don't listen to the radio and just want this for looks more power to you. I will be sending this back and reinstalling my factory antenna.
B005446EVQ|4|great for my leather products
B00KAJXO04|5|My car loves it
B0009IQZFM|5|they work just like described - nice big thick cloth dries the whole car.
B00Y5EZ7I2|5|AAAAA
B000P9WCMK|5|It just works. The instructions that come with it aren't that great though - for example, they reference other documents that aren't included. I highly recommend browsing YouTube -- endless video instructions are available there. It's a lot easier to install this if you can see what you need to do.<br /><br />You'll also need some tools that aren't standard. Off the top of my head, you'll need a plastic car trim remover and a thin metal &#34;key&#34; tool to remove the GPS display. Again, YouTube is your friend.<br /><br />As far as the aux cable itself goes, it seems pretty high quality. The cable is wrapped in what I assume is a protective layer of cloth.
B00JGQLZJ4|5|AAAAA++++
B0048J13R8|5|item was exactly as described,fit perfect,seemed to be good quality.haven't driven vehicle since installment so do not know how it performs yet.shipping was fast.price was good.would buy again if needed
B004Y3V2N8|5|Works as expected. Dorman products have yet to let me down.
B00IRYVK5A|5|Fit the helmet perfect, I did not realize how scratch up my visor was until I put on the new one and can see again
B00JBGAR9I|5|Ok
B008NDGSHA|5|I love the product!!!! very happy!!
B004SVFOVM|5|This is a quality cover. I have a 2015 Tacoma double can with 5 foot bed. Easy install. Don't tighten anything up until you place where you want it. Only thing I don't like is the little rubber strip that lays in the tailgate between the cover and gate. It has to be pulled out over the gate everything you close the gate. If you don't, the water drains into the bed. Looks beautiful too.
B0009IQZFM|3|It does an &#34;ok&#34; job of drying the car.  It is not as good as the microfiber towels that I have purchased from other companies at the same or lower price.  Better than a terry cloth towel but not even close to the best waffle microfiber towel on the market.
B000KKDEQM|5|Fit my CRF150 2012
B00JGJGIKW|5|The best
B005BGRRJA|5|We have ordered Weather Tech in the past & knew we would be satisfied with any of their products.  we were right.
B001UMZ07A|5|Good product I recommend it!
B003TOFMLQ|4|Does the job it's supposed to do. Pretty easy to use.
B00XHI724Y|5|Excellent
B00PXC5PNC|5|Easy to install and works great
B00BJLGXZK|5|Got this for a 05 volvo s40, worked greak
B00LLU7ALA|5|This chamois really works wonderfull!  It really is what the manufacture say it does!  Try It!! It is the best chamois you can buy!
B00HG76A9A|5|Great oil at a great price
B000CSIP84|5|nice product, as described
B000C5G9LM|4|works just like stock model
B00C0SQ92I|5|Inexpensive and very clear to look through. I'd buy ten more.
B000H6QWWC|4|Seemed to work pretty well put on a long trip they needed a lot of adjustments
B001F7CF32|4|Very good option and price.
B007G83SSK|5|great product<br /><br />nice and light!
B00CD2R3EE|1|Installed on hood.  Seemed to fit great.  Clips on either side kept falling off when driving causing the end pieces to vibrate in the wind.  I tightened them about 5 times in 5 days.  Only alternative would be to drill into the hood (nope!).  Removed the entire thing and threw in garbage.  Waste of $65.
B00BD4SKY0|3|Fits great but the blue is more like a dark purple. Very disappointing
B00KTIQDZY|5|Awesome product, my key guy set it up in 5 minutes.
B00W8LR61K|4|Need to put better,wider tape. But otherwise great product and good price!
B001BCLWFS|4|Its  a  nice  mirror  and i only  have  one  problem  with  it  and  thats  because  it didn't  come  with  the  nuts  to  mount  it  so i had to take  it  into  the  hardware  store  and  find  the  nuts  to fit  it but other then  that  i would  have  given  it  5  stars
B000B66UUW|4|Exact replacement and appears to be constructed same as OEM. VERY GOOD buy.
B00O72R7Z8|5|Worked great and done everything it was supposed to do
B00TEHDXPO|4|iPad holder height a little low for an adult in the back seat of a Honda CRV. Otherwise good holder.
B00B9F4SLM|5|GOOD QUALITY FOR A GOOD PRICE
B00PH97FQG|3|It would be nice if they would have included instructions on how to properly install the manifold and what included parts are not necessary for certain vehicle applications.  Other manufactures include installation instructions and proper bolt torque sequence.
B003ZAGMEA|3|It's really light and doesn't slip on smooth concrete.  My only issue is the back of the ramps got crushed after my car rolled over flat portion.  Still works as advertised, but it's not very strong at the back of the ramp.  I used it on an FRS which weights no more than 2800 lbs.
B002GO95V8|5|Easy installation and fit my E350 Motorhome perfectly.  I took the advice of an earlier review and rather than follow the instructions by only loosening the bumper I completely removed it - saved a lot of time and frustration.  Just make sure you've got the right drill and drill bit and a torque wrench for the bolts (have to enlarge two existing holes in the frame).  I used thread locker (Loktite) on the bolts even though it isn't called for.  Requires cutting a square notch in the plastic below the bumper and trimming some material from the plastic shroud under the front end; I did both with a cordless multi-tool.  When finished you'll have to move the license plate bracket to one side or the other - just leave yourself enough room between the bracket and the receiver to get a receiver pin in when you hook up your ball mount.
B00AIGJDMM|5|I wish it was a little longer and had a quick release safety feature,. but it seems to be made well.
B000AMBNPY|4|Great size!!!!! Fits my truck windows perfectly. Only disappointment is the suction cups. They curl up and are hard to stick to the windows. But, I am pleased with the product though.
B000FKKOK6|4|I expected louder since it boasts so much about it.  It's louder than my OEM, but not as loud as the packaging would make you think.  Sounds like a Semi when paired with the matching low tone.
B002CN2812|5|Fit great .
B00E1ETJNU|5|These are well made and heavy duty. Look good on my 2012 Dodge Ram. Should last forever.
B003T77VT4|5|Great product except a lock to prevent bike rack theft is pricey and the back tire strap will not secure a deep dish 80mm carbon fiber wheel rim. I had to buy an aftermarket strap called &#34;Fat Strap&#34; which does allow 80mm dish carbon wheels like Zipps
B0035RZ280|5|Does what it says. Just received mine today and works Great.
B00M0CQWGW|3|Installation is easy but it doesn't match the contour of the brake light frame. So it's either the top or the bottom part must have space.
B003YLMQ54|5|Great quality and very easy to install.
B00BSJBD9Y|3|Based on the title of the post I thought I was paying for two (2) stickers but I only received one (1). :-(
B000IG1SDY|3|seems to be well built but I have to add some rubber or something to get it to secure to a smaller steering wheel.
B000765MHI|4|works good
B004S2PY34|5|works great
B00032KC3K|5|Fit great and look great with my black out look
B00DBEM5FU|3|didn't fit vehicle despite amazon's garage ensuring me it would
B008XCUX0E|5|Great experience, cheap and works great
B000CNHDHI|5|Fast shipping and easy to install
B00DDABS7S|5|Purchased for a 2009 BMW K1300S.  I'm pretty tall, (6'4), so I've always had a hard time with long rides on this bike.  Granted, it is a bigger bike, my knees were still touching the upper tank area and my ankles were at a very sharp angle.  That being said, I wanted to find some lowering pegs.  I looked at HP rearsets initially, but for the price, I didn't think they would do the job. The HP rearsets and others like it on the market move the pegs forward and closer to the shifter/brake, not necessarily down...down some, but not enough to fork out $500-$700.<br /><br />Enter the Slingshot Racing Adjustable Footpegs.  Good product build overall.  Paint and finish are professional and appear high in quality. Installation is a breeze.  Simply remove c-clip from underside of pivot bolt, slide bolt up to remove the old peg.  You will need to remove the shifter pivot bolt to remove the old peg bolt.  Brake side is a breeze, no additional hardware removal other than the c-clip.  Just do the opposite to replace.  Make a mental note (or take a picture) of the spring locations.<br /><br />Now the adjustment.  Offers plenty of adjustment, move up, down and all around.  Find the sweet spot and then fine tune the peg threads.  All in all, this process should take you no more than 5 min tops, both sides.<br /><br />Anything not great?? Well, yes.  To allow for the angle drop of the new peg, the whole peg gets pushed out some making the existing shifter and brake pedal harder to reach.  You will have to consciously point your feet inward to catch the pedals. I feel that with boots (to widen your footprint), and some practice, muscle memory should take over, but time will tell.<br /><br />I can say, that when I sat on the bike, I was like, &#34;Nooice&#34;.  My ankles were relaxed and my knees felt like they were finally where they were supposed to be.<br /><br />I started out by saying I was tall, but, I don't want you to think this product is only useful for gigantors. The shortcrowd will get use too, as the upper and forward adjustments offer the same advantages.<br /><br />Enjoy the crap load..or crapload of pics.  I was hoping to show you all the angles of the bike, so you can see how the new pegs change the bike's overall fit.<br /><br />Stay safe out there people.<br /><br />Oh, and thanks for making these Mr. Slingshot Racing, let me know if you need someone to demo/test any new products for the K.
B00PXQZPOC|1|Poor quality product. Edges are not cut correctly so it does not fit perfect. Buy something else or OEM
B000BZL08U|5|Outstanding buy and works 100%
B00C1CRYNQ|1|These aftermarket valve covers SUCK.  I had to pay mechanic a second time to have this removed ...brand new valve cover had a crack in it and oil was shooting everywhere.  Junk!
B008B9FE08|5|Works and looks nice
B00B5ZYY38|5|These were easy to put on and look very sharp on the car. It is a good Idea to have a set for the front and back of the car when you need to use two license plates. Double check the screw size needed on your cars license plate, they are not all created equal.
B005EJJN28|5|It has held my bikes and rack without issues.
B00G25GOCA|5|Great stuff however cheaper available in local hardware store
B009F10S3Y|5|these are bomb.com.... they added an extra inch to my car and can bottom out on stuff and not brake sense they are rubber
B00GRHRTEU|1|Just got these today and mounted them and I already hate them.<br /><br />1. Groves on the bracket are not deep enough to stop the mirror from moving at highway speeds<br />2. Terrible field of view, especially on passenger side<br />3. I could make a better looking/ more functional pair of these myself for under $20
B0035RI9Y4|5|Great price; fit perfectly.  Arrived quickly and no damage!! Not disappointed.  First major car part purchase on Amazon.  No regrets.
B00HEZQHTM|5|I purchased this for my 2013 GMC Denali HD w/ the 6.6L Duramax deisel engine. Royal Purple makes a few different fuel additives but this one is designed specifically for modern deisel engines according to the official Royal Purple website.
B000M5Y72A|5|East installation
B000O02K2M|5|Works great!  Wish I had found it and ordered sooner.  Easy fix for broken gas door.
B00SLHL5J4|5|Fast delivery, bolted right on, no problem.
B00F7NEREU|5|This is holding up nicely. The braided border keeps it from getting deformed, and I haven't had any of the beads  break off like some of the reviewers wrote. They are threaded with fishing line.<br />I think its a great product.
B00IEKNQJ0|5|The 11.1&#34; works perfectly on the 05' Honda Accord LX 2.4L VTech Sedan. The 11.8&#34; does mot UNLESS you buy the caliper bracket for the pins. Please make sure when you swap out rotors to re-grease the pins with high temp grease. This will help with any overheating it may cause from rotor swap. Also, it would be wise to go ahead and buy new break pads. Since you already have everything off, might as well change them. What's the point in using old pads? Tremendous stopping power. I can stop a 100 mph accord in just under 4 seconds. Without locking up. That's alot better than stock which would have probably bent the rotors.
B008427D88|5|These push pins fit the underbody of the 2010 Prius perfectly, for holding on the plastic splash shield (see caveat below). Excellent purchase, highly recommended.<br /><br />IMPORANT!!!!<br />The Prius uses TWO sizes of push pins!! These pins fit the LARGE holes perfectly, and work well when a pin goes through multiple layers of plastic. However most of the underbody holes require a SMALLER pin!  Amazon sells the following push-pins which I use to fit the SMALLER, more numerous holes perfectly:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MUOPNG?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00  Be sure to buy some of both the large and small fasteners to replace any that break.
B002MF2FZE|4|Some  adjustments  had to be made for Headlamps to fit, however, water is getting into  the right side headlamp, presumably, due to condensation.  The left side is perfect. What should<br /> I do ?
B000CNL9X2|5|They look great!
B0015PTTZ6|5|These fit as well if not better than OE. I have installed many aftermarket lights over the years and these are very good quality. Install is straight forward. There are no instructions with the lights. It would be nice if they would have explained the use/operation of the included resistor block. After a bit of experimenting you can hook them up in one of two ways on this particular vehicle. #1, just plug up the resistor & use the adhesive pad to stick it to the back of the light housing. #2, do not use the resistor, leave the pigtail hanging loose, change the turn signal/hazzard flasher with a NAPA EP-29L flasher (for use with LEDs), works perfect. One of the benefits to LEDs, besides being brighter, is they draw less amps. If you use the resistor that benefit is lost.
B005CLQ3RQ|5|A++
B00P1N8QU2|5|Good quality.  Much better than other brands I have tried.
B008KZKFLQ|5|fit perfectly
B00OS7KL3W|5|it was an easy install for the most part, havnt noticed much performance, but my mileage did go up about 2-3MPG if i can keep the throttle in check. Great product and i absolutely love it!
B00K2G5I40|4|Very bright colors, good construction.  NOT LARGE ENOUGH FOR A FORD F-150 windshield, by about 4&#34;.  Nevertheless, very good for a standard sedan or coupe.
B00L5TDOOY|5|Good quality and perfect size. I did not want some large overwhelming obnoxious sticker on my car. Not to big and not to small.
B00QKSY2V4|4|Great perforation breath ability and basic hand protection at this price point they are fantastic
B007UHEDQ8|5|OEM VW triangle as advertised at a price much lower than your local parts department
B00W014J0Y|3|Works good for the price. The suction cups tend to fall off over time or when it is really hot, but overall decent value.
B001KOD4IK|1|DID NOT FIT MY BIKE 2008 ROAD KING...
B00A74HHT6|5|good
B004C6WLTQ|5|Very durable and the colors have not faded
B00NR3LHOU|5|Super easy to install!  I've had no issues after installation like some have had.
B00PCRSGT8|4|No instructions included but a quick YouTube search has vid of a nice chap showing how to do install the stand.<br /><br />Not sure where the lock washer was supposed to go though.<br /><br />The item came pretty quickly so kudos to the seller on that.
B000RN4FK6|5|I really like these. They are adjustable and easy to put on and take off. They are spacious and I have not had any problems with them.
B0014EAWPY|5|I've got hose, in different area codes.
B00D95SJYW|5|The set of 4 batteries works perfectly in the Oxygen Lepton scooter.<br />Update: only lasted two years with light use. Now switching to motorcycle batteries bought from battery store (have to modify connectors).
B00BZAGGTI|5|Excellent product.  Exact fit.  Received it 2 day's before the estimated ship date
B004PC5F0E|5|Fit perfect good product, great price. I love Amazon!!!!
B002QBNH9W|5|good stuff
B005MZVN7M|5|Love it
B0046BHVAG|5|Good product
B002NGCO30|5|This was an impressive charger! I took on a 4 day camping trip with 12 women. - To say the least, it was used a lot, and for every feature it possessed.
B004NDF6IQ|5|Very Happy
B000CF7CPE|5|My volvo signals stopped working, was told this same flasher was going to be over $50 plus labor. I was a little concern about the price, but since it was way less than the estimated price given before I decided to order it anyways. Came a day before the schedule delivery and my friend just unplug it and plug the new one... long story short the signals work just fine and only paid under $20. Happy customer
B004RNOVTM|5|Great hose! perfect size
B00H3ZCP7G|5|Pretty good.  Fit easily.  I'd buy again.
B00IGMK9EQ|5|I've had these installed for over a year now on my Kawasaki Vulcan and they work great!  My directionals do blink faster than they did before and I only have these installed on the rear.  It's possible if you install them on the front and back they may blink too fast because the resistance will be lowered.
B006H34BUY|1|this thing shedded little grey bits every where.  did nothing to pick up dust and put more down on my dashboard.
B00V7NEPYG|5|They were a direct fit for my JK, but everyone will have a different installation due to the vast assortment of front bumpers found on Jeeps.  I purchased adaptors so splicing wasn't necessary.  But splicing would have been a breeze had I needed to.  I asked a Question listed here on the Q&A section for this product and someone directed me on which adaptor to buy.  I previously purchased the JW Speaker headlights for around $720 and I have been very satisfied with those headlights.  I am even happier with this product, however, because it is identical to the JWS but they cost 1/4 of the price.  (I paid $80 for two lamps)  As far as form and function go they couldn't be better.  They are so freaking bright it is astounding. There is no flicker whatsoever.  The lens quality and the build is identical to the branded $350 set - just minus the logo.  It is the same product.  When I look at the front end of my Jeep I can't help but think that I could have saved a ton of cash if I had just purchased the headlights from this seller too.
B0009IQXXG|5|Great purchase looks and works great for up to 2 weeks. Then I wash my car and add some more. It shold last me for abut 3 months.
B00SP16ZP0|5|The plate is bigger.  I thought the writing would be bigger so check out the specs before you order.
B0012ILZAS|5|thanks to deal with you its good<br />thanks
B0050LU2GQ|5|These are Great for the hang tags .  The only problem I have found is it  is hard to<br />place hang tag over wires if you have wires going to your rear view mirror.<br />The plastic is a great weight and will preserve the handicap tag.
B00CBY7HAE|5|Genuine GM, and looks great on the car.
B000C9M82M|5|exactly as described!
B0053LS7C4|4|Fitment and quality is not the best but is far from being the worst. 4 stars for the price and fast shipping.  Requires some work before getting it painted.
B003YI1784|5|These ended up being a great solution to our messy Maine car floors! They are super durable, fit perfectly, and look great. So easy to clean, though I haven't washed them yet-- just vacuuming has been enough for now. Looking forward to seeing how they handle the winter's snow, salt, and sand.
B002VE3VHW|5|My husband loves it.  It fits our riding mower just fine.
B00U6G8TE2|5|very nice
B000E4S7L6|2|made of plastic.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Nice bar, exceeded my expectations
B0084OPZ2W|5|For the price these are very nice
B0009H51MG|1|Does not fit my car. Was told that I have to pay shipping cost to return it.
B00SHZK0EQ|2|Not strong enough to hold the gate up.
B000KIH97E|5|Put these lights on my Honda ST1100 hooked to high beams and went to a 70 mph bike at night from a 50 mph bike. I live in the country and deer are a plague at night.
B002T49R9U|5|Great struts and shocks! Very satisfied..
B00W2XF1AM|5|Easy to install. Works great! After leaving my windows cracked on hot days and having my seats and floor get wet in an unexpected shower, this product now lets the air circulate by letting me leave a 3/4 crack at the top of each window.
B00017YYIG|5|OMG a must have. These made pulling our 30ft 5th Wheel so much smoother. I was told by hubby that install was &#34;not too bad&#34;. I think he had to re drill some holes. But they are in and work great. I would also recommend the On Board Air, it makes adjusting pressure while pulling a snap.
B0035ZHDDY|1|wrong item says for smh 5 and 10 dose not fit 5 at all --- I am lucky I have a smh 10 but I bought this for my dad to use on his smh5 was a no go and I even spent money on 2 day shiping just to get something that was of no use to me will not recommend don't waste ya money unless you have a smh 10 and looking for a back up
B0009JKI6I|5|No problems, as advertised.
B00K5ECRUM|5|Perfect fit,ordering the rear one to match..looks bad ass! So much better than the stock one!
B00N78I25W|3|-1 star slow shipping<br />-1 star product wasn't even RED. More of a maroon color.
B000BUU5Y0|5|Works as advertised. Good value.
B00CR44I7S|4|Didn't quite &#34;click&#34; into place like the stock connectors do so I wasn't 100% sure it was fully connected, but everything matched up and was good quality.
B006QH560A|5|Great Battery, Well aworth The $160 Spent Compared To An AutoZone Duralast Battery That Was $120...
B002P8OU0G|1|Not as described on order.
B002TO86NS|5|It works excellent.
B00EECM22O|5|Best bulbs I've purchased. Very subtle blue and very bright. Not to obnoxious and not to blinding to drivers in front
B003VJTQ70|5|Perfect fit for my 2013 Camaro!!!  Easy to install, made of high quality material, works like it should, air in, rain out !!!  And YES, they apply to the body (paint) of the door frame, however the sticky strip is just like a heavy duty command strip, and why would you want to remove them anyway.  Also they look like a custom fit on my black car and look like it came from the factory that way!  No disappointments here!!!
B00D3298A0|4|Very good quality
B00SRY6O2E|2|The size it says that it is, is not the size.
B00W5RAIRQ|5|Work great. Looks great. Highly recommend.
B000CJ1ZOO|3|Box was open on the end when received no hardware and was bent had to straighten
B00KQ3WEBE|3|Little small compared to regular mits.
B00IV50JTS|5|Works great.  Pull cold air from between your knees and sends directly to your legs and back.  The back air is weak but  you can feel it.  The leg air flow is amazing.  This is one of the best products i've bought to deal with the hot alabama weather!
B008S9CJZO|5|Been using this for about 2 week and I couldn't have been happier. The open face gives me so much more perspective when rising and vents on top of helmet help on hot days.
B007IDM5RI|3|Runs small
B002UCYRZU|5|Great product I would recommend this product to anyone who polishes plastic, acrylic, and horn. I polish straight razor scales of various materials and Novus products work great. JR
B004QQBG7U|5|HUGE difference between these and other cheaply made after market rotors.  Put these on a 2011 GMC Terrain and they work great.  They have a larger diameter than the other aftermarket rotors that fit the terrain so you can see minor rust in the area that the brake pad doesn't hit the entire rotor but still a great buy!
B000FTUL9Q|4|Can't say its worth the price out of the box but I have seen some improvement over cleaning the old stock part.
B000BO71M0|4|I had a little crack in my tail light because someone drove into the back of me.  Instead of spending $150+ to replace the entire light I decided to just use a piece of this tape to cover up that spot.  It doesn't glow in the dark or anything like that but it did blend in nicely with my tail light and it stuck on to my car in sunshine, rain, snow, and car washes.
B00EZ4BXH6|4|The hose was the right size for my gun. I bought this because I lost my old hose. The coupler had the tendency to not come off. Even with a screwdriver, until you loosened it completely.  I found out the reason for this is there was too much spring tension on the internal parts of the coupler. If you unscrew the coupler, and take the little spring out, you can put it in a vice, or even in a pair of pliars, and lightly squeeze it. Then I used a torch to heat a few of the loops red hot, them let it cool in the vice. After that, it stayed the size that it was when it was compressed in the vice. This gave it just enough tension to be locked onto the fitting then tightened, but come off with a few turns on the connector. Other thank that minor obstacle, the hose works perfectly, and is a good length (I believe it is 12&#34;-13&#34;)
B00290FAI6|5|Bought this for a 1999 Bounder RV and it works superb. It really provides a lot of light for the tag. It might be too bright for some, but I like that it illuminates so well. Great for backing at night helps the video camera to see things better. If you need a tag light you can't beat this. It was also easy to install.
B00J2CI4LY|1|They did not fit my 07 Avalanche, even after it said they would fit
B0056DOG60|4|I received black ones instead of the polished steel.  At first I was a bit mad because I thought I was going to have to go to the trouble of sending them back and waiting another week or more for new ones to be delivered. But I decided to keep them since I thought the black actually looked better when I put them next to my truck.  However, one of the plastic end caps on one bar was broken - I suppose during shipping. Used it anyway since I sure didn't want to go to the trouble of trying to get that replaced. They were fairly easy to install, but the instructions that come in the package seem to be reverse of what I actually had to do. The front mounting bracket in their diagram should really go in the rear, and the rear in the front.  Overall I'm satisfied - they complete the look of the truck. We'll see how they hold up.
B00GQ2TC14|3|junk.
B00RKKITYC|4|it works with my Jeep Cherokee 2015
B0029TQDLA|5|Works great and protects
B00RGZWIW0|5|The only suggestion for improvement is perhaps a few Velcro strips on the bottom, for trunks with carpeting, that would keep the organizer from sliding.  You could include a flap to cover the Velcro for those that don't want to use it.
B00UU2Q2SW|5|Excellent
B00ATQ0MX0|1|Was not the right kind of air flow sensor for my jaguar x type 2005. Not happy would not take it back.
B002MQAWOY|4|Great product I use it when ever I shovel snow and this kept my face warm to the point that I was sweating
B00EA0ZB7I|2|these are ok lights and you definitely get what you pay for. Brighter than headlights but don't reach out as far and any scratch will rust. These also cause radio interference with most FM frequencies when switched on!!!! But they work and look alright
B000BSYZQQ|5|works well
B00LC8AV80|5|Silly me, I didn't read closely enough, and I thought this was the full fob with the electronics inside. Anyway, I cracked open my sad, worn old key fob and the electronics fit perfectly into this shiny new case! Yay!
B000WJJ4U6|2|These pliers are unique in that they are some of the only snap rings pliers I've seen that are deep enough to fit inside a shaft to remove internal snap rings. I was using these to remove the snap ring from an AC compressor clutch from a 2006 Honda Odyssey. The Snap ring was pretty thick and tight, and the pins on these pliers snapped while attempting to remove the snap ring in question. The spring was also clearly intended to provide resistance while removing an external snap ring and I had to use these two-handed.<br /><br />If you are using these for a standard external snap ring, they might work great and the thin non-interchangable pins might work well for you.<br /><br />For me, these were a fail, and I ended up using a pair of $3 harbor freight pliers and finally got my snap ring off 4 hours later. No joke, 4 hours trying to get a good angle on the snap ring which was hidden deep inside the shaft of the AC pulley.
B003UT3S6Q|5|This stuff does work pretty well when compared to what you buy in local stores. I had very dirty, brake dust covered wheels that I removed from the vehicle to clean the back sides. It took two or three applications and some scrubbing to remove all of the dirt from the back of the wheels. I like this product because it will turn to a gel type consistency when you rub / scrub the wheels so it really sticks in place. It rinses off easily and it does have an odd smell but it's not horrible or unbearable by any means. I would purchase this product again.
B000CB6D0S|4|In the end it went into the filter area properly but at first thought it wasnt the right size. Compared to the previous one i had, this one felt like it may be a tad bit bigger. It fits though but made me doubt it for a few minutes.
B00T6J95QG|5|Delivered timely,<br />Fit perfect
B00B51WV46|5|Paint was perfect
B007ZG3J8C|5|Great product
B00RKT0V9Y|5|Good high quality part fast shipping
B00KWGNR5C|4|I bought 2 remotes for my 2014 yukon and after having the locksmith out to program them they work great.  There was no way to do it myself for this truck,  but it was much cheaper than the dealer- 80$ the locksmith programmed 2 fobs and cut 2 keys.  I also bought 2 keys which he said were not great quality,  but they work just fine.
B00063Y1F6|5|Prefect!
B00DPIVZGC|5|This is such an improvement over my old  toilet. I needed the high profile and I needed foot room around the base so that I had room for my foot on the flush pedal--- imagine that. The slender profile at the base solved the foot room issue. And the high profile means no more 3 ft. drop to sit, and no more struggle getting up. Makes a big difference. We are all getting older and things get more and more difficult.This solved so many problems for me, I am very happy.  I felt that there was some rocking even after re-tightening the bolts. I noticed some space at the back or the unit where it met the floor and added a piece of vinyl flooring scrap- wedged it in the gap... problem solved. I couldn't blame it on the the toilet.  My 1986 floor is uneven so I expected a little hiccup with a 2015 toilet. I am Very Satisfied.
B004H78NQ0|1|Caution!  Not OEM BMW valve stem caps.  The caps received were made in China and mailed from China which extended the delivery time.  Caps were metal not plastic.  Hopefully they are compatible with the BMW TPMS components.  Labeled as &#34;Visonter Air Cap&#34;.
B0006JO0KG|5|Very cool product at good price. Thanks. ✫†✫ Visit www.Lord-Jesus-Christ.com ✫†✫
B00MI4WTYQ|5|Very nice
B001G7OW5A|5|Worked great
B004HCOE8Q|5|Used this on my Black Boxster after touching up small nicks in hood and wet sanding those areas.It removed fine swirls as well as polishing up areas I wet sanded.The paint on the car was in good shape and did not require compounding.I used my Makita buffer with a Lake Country finishing pad,followed by 2 coats of Mcguires 2.0 sealant.Great result and will buy again from Amazon.
B0001EVXHY|4|The adhesive is really strong on these and won't come off the car at all. The acrylic plastic is a little on the fragile side so definitely be careful not to bend them too much. They of course do what they are designed to do and love the fact I can open the window a bit while driving on a cooler, rainy day without it getting wet inside or having to open my AC and waste more fuel. The truck looks okay with these along with its old Lund hood deflector from 14 years ago...
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Awesome product
B000IIF9JQ|5|Decent item
B00BCRWJUO|5|Excellent
B000E4HIYI|5|I was very happy  with my purchase
B0055B0EUU|5|Fit great.....no issues with installation.
B0009IQZFC|5|Great as advertised.
B006R9MUVK|5|Fast shipping. Perfect color match
B000AO8ZA8|3|Missed reading the review on appearance. I too bought the cover based on the picture assuming it was black and silver (aluminum), but what I got was a traditional blue ford logo. Not happy about the color, but the product quality is fine.
B000CIIDZE|5|Smoother shifts, better reliability and peace of mind. Add high pressure couplings to avoid any mess or worse. Extend the life of your transmission with this small investment.
B00HUHIADU|2|It's a clamp which allows you to add some slack at the top where the belt joins the pillar. When you undo it to move it, it tends to come apart. You must undo it to retract the belt.
B006EGAIII|4|Worked great once I got the car up. Slid back when I tried to mount the first 2 times. Put them against a bump in the driveway to prevent sliding and worked perfectly after that.
B00HHHSMRM|3|They are smaller than they look online.
B001RUSRK2|5|did her Van good
B001DRHMMS|5|Perfect fit and super easy to install on E90 328i 2009
B000MPSBOK|5|Give a B+ for instructions as it gives lots of options for different models/bikes.  However, I was able to install it in about 1/2 day and it works great.
B001S7W836|5|Good tool.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Great product and a good price. Arrived quickly. Easy to operate. Works perfectly.

B010PWSDEW|5|When you buy a Jeep there are two things you learn very quickly: once you start moding it you can't stop, and Jeep parts/accessories are very expensive. I found this set and thought they were priced very reasonably. I decided to take a chance on these lights although I had never heard of the brand. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. I am in a local Jeep club, and on our last trail ride I thought these lights did as good as the light on other members of our club's Jeeps, except they all paid significantly more. The physical quality was also pretty identical. You definitely can't tell the difference between these and a more expensive brand. They are really sturdy, and provide good light.  They were super easy to install; the wiring is the hard part. You do have to purchase a wiring harness separately; I just ordered one off Amazon. This set does come with the mount, which is nice because most sets don't.  Even though these lights are small they do make a noticeable difference when you're on the trail at night. I'll post more pictures on the trail later (it slipped my mind to get some at the time).  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more items of this brand, and am looking into a light bar next. I am interested to see how these hold up in the long run and ahainst the elements. I will update one I've put them through a thorough beating.  ***I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.***
B00XB3WQLO|5|Good Quality wish they made the outside out of leather that would be very nice
B00880D8YY|5|I wear dress pants on most days and although my car keys consist of a smart fob and only 1 other key, I hate carrying it in my pocket. I bought many other keychain holders but they all had the same fault: you needed two hands to operate it. I didn't want to get something that's too easy to open because I don't want to make it easy to steal the key off of my body, but I hated having to use two hands to open the part that holds the key chain, which is the case on most other key chain holders. This item is absolutely perfect! I can put my key fob on the holder and take it with one hand!! Some might find it annoying that it loops through the belt, but frankly I don't mind. I just ordered two more so I can use them in other pants too if I don't want to remove it each time I change pants/belts. Well designed product and it feels solid. If you don't like walking around with your keys in your pocket, this is the solution!
B007VRAN5M|5|works great
B00W5MG8XY|5|Super easy to use & a great safety product to have in your vehicle!
B00BT1H19C|5|Perfect!

B000GTX0E8|5|awesome product
B00R33YUZI|5|Very good item
B009IF1V1K|5|I picked this up to repair the A/C in my 1197 F-150.  I had watched several YouTube videos on how to replace the blend door, and honestly it was quite simple.  My truck is a stick shift which caused a little difficulty in removing the floor vents, and this was actually the only time that I went to get my husband to help.  Everything else went super smooth.  About 2 hours from start to finish. I choose to use epoxy to repair the hole that gets cut behind the dash, rather than the A/C duct tape that was supplied in the kit.  But this was just a personal preference, I don't think there is anything wrong with the supplied tape.  It's summer in the southern USA and has been several months now and the A/C is still working great.  If a woman can fix it, so can you!
B00K5A907E|1|This part did not fit accurately on my 2001 4runner. Unsure of the proper application. Was able to get it to work by running and extra hose from it but did not fit the way that it should especially form a Dorman product.
B007CLNIJK|5|Perfect fit, modest cost, unbelievable fast delivery.  Thanks very much
B000U3TTN6|4|Awesome product. I used them as my fog lights. Their super yellow and also very bright. They were shipped fast and packaged nicely. I would give 5 stars except the first pair had a dead bulb. I told the seller and they shipped me a new pair right away. I would definitely recommend these!
B00UW19ZJO|5|Works as intended
B005NLQAHS|5|This thing is great
B0023WAGBG|4|Very good love the way it looks on my Durango
B00E60SHXM|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B00801RRIE|4|went in easily without help from someone else. excellent ride quality as well.
B00IFMOVE6|2|I read reviews for these bead covers and compared them with reviews and specs and decided to spend the money on these over other options. We got these in the mail and upon opening them I noticed they smelled quite strong and unpleasant, and the coating on them was a weird orange, like someone had eaten cheese curls on them.  One fit the passenger's seat quite well and is doing just fine. The other went on the driver's side, installed the exact same way. It fit awkwardly between being too short and there was a weird bunch because the shoulders weren't wide enough and something was off. About three weeks later, that cover snapped in a few places and beads went everywhere. The passenger seat is still going strong, I just wish we'd received two good products in the mail instead of one.
B00B1U6I54|4|very good no more check engine ligth very sastifies
B00KJGPN2K|5|Have a SMH10 also which I happily passed down to a family member.  I liked it.  The 20S-01 is definitely a mrs refined device.  So far very impressed
B004I17J10|5|Was easy to install and adjust
B00KJGPQE0|5|A perfect fit for my second helmet and the 20S.  The only downside is it is a little pricey compared to what I paid for my additional clamp kit for my old SMH10. Having said that it is also more complex with the built in headphone jack and the ambient button.
B000CMJ1RY|2|Will this adapter fit any name brand of steering wheel
B001MPY4ZO|1|Avoid these applicator pads.  One of the pads split at the seam after an initial machine wash.  I hadn't even used it to apply car wax yet.  Item does not cost enough to justify the return shipping costs so I'll have to eat the cost.
B001EOL87U|5|nice fit and finish
B002X9WJ7S|5|Great design and excellent adhesive
B00WGPFK4I|5|Wonderful product, I have bad allergies and thus product has helped me tremendously
B00X51C338|5|Looks great and arrived three days before the arrival date. Applies easy and sticks really well.
B004J6H568|5|Appears to be a high quality part, truck stops much better. Good price
B000W7F2GI|3|Return nozzle is a little weak (broke off when I first used it), but it did what it was supposed to do.  It fit my bleeder valve snug and no leaks.  As another reviewer pointed out, however, the hose nozzle does get quite slippery after use.  The brake fluid definitely adds enough lubrication to allow the tubing to slide off your bleeder valve...so be careful.
B00CLUYFNA|5|best tiedowns i ever bought. i bought metal clips for my cargo net and got rid of the worthless plastic ones..
B000BUU5XG|5|Great!!
B00VUXTHBE|2|It's already broken. And it's only a week since I installed it.
B002GTT388|5|Very nice quality.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|It works just as stated and was easy to install
B009DJU5OK|5|Very satisfied.. Keep up the great work !
B002ZTGX3W|5|Easy to install. Works perfectly. Just follow directions and have someone with small hands around. Lol
B00YN6Y4R2|5|What a great value,can't buy 3 at the local hardware for the same money,serve my needs very well,don't hesitate great quality also.
B007LIBU8U|5|Beautiful,<br />Perfect
B00JKE84X2|3|Cheap construction but worked properly easy to install hard to beat for the price
B00681BE2S|5|It is perfect. Now I have three sets of keys and fobs. Hopefully, I won't lock myself out.<br /><br />Just follow their instructions exactly.
B001C6LG3Q|3|hello
B000GROI2I|5|Love it
B000E8X42Y|5|Excellent shocks.... My car went from being a basketball to being a cushioned easy chair!  Fantastic!
B000EQR7XS|5|Fit perfectly
B001FJTAGK|3|Received the shocks quickly and we'll packed. Only and biggest complaint I have is that they appeared used or at minimum, exposed to the weather. Several areas with rust and corrosion. Having it at my mechanic's shop and rear end of my truck dismantled, there was no turning back. They appear to be working fine a day later. Just wish they would have been new as listed.
B004KCVR06|3|The item is not so bad. They're a little small and unnoticable but not bad for the price I paid.
B000BMWXZM|5|I liked these better than the others because of the numerous and positive reviews.  They are also bigger than the cheaper ones.  I figure the larger size will fit in one's hand better for improved leverage if I ever have to use the seatbelt cutter.  I also like that the hammer has identical peens on both sides so that I won't have to think about which side to use in an emergency.  The carry case that comes with it looks like it mounts with screws only.  I was hoping for an adhesive as I don't wish to screw holes in my dash.  I'll keep it in the center console.  I hope I never have to use these!
B001ABOQEO|1|There is nothing wrong with the filters.  However, Manufacturer doesn't make them for the 2.5L engine for the 2002 Subarus.
B000N5UV5Q|5|Received and well packaged.  Would purchase again.
B002E30O9S|5|I am very please. So Far so Good!  Extremely Please at the delivery time!!!
B005M29YEY|5|These work PERFECTLY for what we need them for. We have a slightly elevated part on our deck so that there is clearance for the pump underneath. These mats eliminated the toe stubbing that was so terrible last summer.
B0041Q2BM4|1|Didn't fit my 2012 BMW K1600GTL like their chart says but the quality is excellent. Factory didn't know if it would fit my cycle either.
B000CLPDCW|4|I used these pads on my 1988 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, while they are a bit of overkill on the street and it does take a bit more effort - towing or heavy loads have never been easy to stop.<br /><br />On the first voyage, before bedding the pads I was concerned that the pedal effort needed was just too much, after they settled in I am very impressed.
B006GLEBIO|2|I would give this item 5 stars if, 1. I bought 2 of them and was told by the seller that they worked on same frequency, meaning 1 remote would operate both control boxes. Which it is not on the same frequency. 2. The lights dont even cycle through the modes the same way, which means alot of clicking the remotes. 3. The fade through color option does not go at the same speed. And yes, i know there is multiple fade speeds. If your just buying 1, 5 stars...and be ready to add more wire to get the lights to reach their destination.
B00EPOKCWI|3|The Good:<br /><br />Light output looks great. My stock color lights were very weak; these really brighten up the road.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />They lasted about 7 months before 1 burned out, which I guess could be worse.. I will probably order these again...
B00DMTX34Q|5|Very nice
B0082ACF1M|5|Works and looks great!  I bought it to make camping trips easier and my gear dry.  It rained on my camping trip, but this Tonno Pro cover kept everything dry.
B00HNHXIOI|5|Wow! These look incredible! And They arrived early! A little tricky to install but mostly self explanatory. Just make sure you have a ratchet and 8mm socket and a medium phillips-head screwdriver. You are also going to need a replacement Amber-colored build for the turn signal.
B007KCZU4M|5|Perfect fit
B00TMFQYFE|5|Works for me
B000182EU0|1|Junk doesn't fit a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee 5.9 at all!

B00L237U98|3|Doesn't really stay on as well as I had hoped
B008WFPCDA|2|Bought these because I don't like the &#34;Art of Speed&#34; stickers on some of the other listings.  This had non-3M adhesive, but something generic.  Additionally, the Genesis Coupe emblem is very faded.  Ended up getting the ones with with Art of Speed backing and cut it away so I could have the emblems that were very vivid.
B00XII75XG|5|Put it on my black car. Looks great.
B00HJDY6PG|5|Just as advertised! Fits and looks perfect in our 2015 Toyota Highlander!
B0097CE2NS|5|Works great
B00A93UNL4|5|Amazing Decal. No bubbles and looks awesome. And it's made in the US of A! Very proud to have it.
B001AWU6KQ|4|Excellent value!
B003P9US8W|5|Great product
B00199HWZ2|5|Great item, lots less than the dealership. 2 minute installation.
B00XZ9PJUO|5|Received this key within one week of ordering it.  There were detailed instruction on how to proceed with replacing my old broken remote key.  I took the key to a local GM dealer and they cut the key.  After that I followed the directions that were provided and it was simple and easy.  I spent way less money doing this and I am so grateful that I found this key on Amazon.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend this replacement option to anyone looking to &#34;do it yourself&#34;.  Very easy.
