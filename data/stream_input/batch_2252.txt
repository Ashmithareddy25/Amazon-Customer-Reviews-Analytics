B008764ZQ4|4.0|A fun romp through classic rock.  I loved these songs growing up and it was fun to have them redone in movie format.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Supposed to have been the free app of the day. Instead, only the first levels are available and then requires payment to continue. Enjoyed what I could play.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I did not think I would like this show.  I have heard so much about it, but never wanted to shell out the money.  Since it is available with my Amazon Prime account, I gave it a shot.  Well, I am so glad I did.  Its crazy, funny, dramatic, and all kinds of wonderful.  I cant wait to watch the next season.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Out of all the songs on this album What the Water gave me is my fave for sure. Florence and Isabella are awesome song writers
B000WLKGLK|5.0|I am fortunate to be familiar with Garbage stemming from my teenage years of living in Illinois. The band's music was frequently featured on the Chicago, Illinois alternative rock station Q101 during the mid to late 1990's. I also caught some of their music videos on MTV and VH1.  For some strange reason, I even heard their music in one of my dreams around 6-7 years ago. Due to these listed circumstances, I am most familiar with the following solemn but catchy songs:\\"Vow\\", \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\",\\"Stupid Girl\\", \\"#1 Crush (featured on the soundtrack for the 1996 Romeo and Juliet movie), \\"Push It\\", \\"I Think I'm Paranoid\\", \\"Special\\", \\"When I Grow Up\\", and \\"The World Is Not Enough\\".  I also enjoy that this edition also includes some of the songs as featured remixes. \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" (U.N.K.L.E Remix), \\"Cherry Lips\\" (Go Baby Go), and \\"You Look So Fine\\" are currently some of the songs that I currently enjoy on this  collection.  However, there are many other notable songs on this alternative rock set due to the pleasant vocals, multiform mixes of music, and musical tracks that contain unadulterated emotions. \\"Absolute Garbage\\" (Special Edition) by Garbage is best for those who like greatest hits collections containing industrial rock and/or electronica rock.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Fantastic songs and hooks and lyrics and ... Too bad they made a mediocre broadway version of it. I walked out after 15 minutes. Lame to say the least. What did I expect? I expected some class, but who am I to know about those things, right? I expected some life and soul but all I got was middle class boredom, but who am I to know about life and soul. I expected fire and rage and ....
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I stink at this so far .... too fast for me and I crash a lot ... but great graphics.  Should let me play a good bit more before asking for a rating.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like playing this game. SCRATT is really funny in the game by going back and forth and having me catch him. The videos are great too.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|Like the cd a lot but Ceremonials is a better album. Faves dog days, cosmic love, Rabbit Heart, my boy builds coffins
B000ICXQGK|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants hope in the afterlife of love and sacrifice. It helped me feel optimistic regarding what I hope heaven will be like.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|It would be fair to say that this recording is the best live they ever did of the pertinent tunes. A notch higher than extended Fillmore East Classic of ´71....
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|I really liked the movie.  The reason I purchased it is my kids.  They really wanted the movie.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I think the movie was over priced.

B00973DDN2|3.0|Like some of the songs This is my first Killers album. Theyre a bit different than I expected. Sometimes their music can be a bit too Bob Dylan/Bruce Springstein-ish for me.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was a very interesting read.  It never crossed my mind that people spoke and received love differently. This was a big eye opener and i recommend it to everyone!

B000025JJ4|5.0|Fantastic last album with Mr. Blackmore on guitar. I was always reluctant to buy this album,but was very surprised when I did hear it. Why did I wait 20 years to get it? Strong album and very worthy of adding to my Deep Purple collection.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Wish I could say that Josh is back to making me swoon, like he did with his first two cds but, alas, All That Echoes is not All That Great.
B004AFFZNI|1.0|This does NOT work with the Hero3, even though it does come up as the right thing for the 3 here on Amazon.

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I've never enjoyed Bond movies until Craig took over. Past movies straight up sucked. Now the movies don't feel corny or geared to mentally challenged teen agers.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|As good as a book about swimming can be. I'm an (almost) non-swimmer, just starting lessons in late adulthood. The book was useful to introduce concepts I learnt about later in the pool from my instructor. Watching the YouTube videos by Swim Smooth is also recommended.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|While the original game is considered a &quot;classic&quot; by many, this &quot;ad-free&quot; version is neither the &quot;classic version&quot;, nor &quot;ad-free&quot;. Yes, the 3rd party advertising banner has been left out of this offering, but the &quot;advertising&quot;, pardon me, the abundance of additions that inform you of nearly everything in Rovio's lineup of Angry Birds variants, experienced while playing through this particular release, is something I find significantly unpleasant.<br /><br />It doesn't help matters any that this release is also detected by your default Android market app as being the free version and notifies you of an update. Should you accept this update, you will lose all of your progress and now have that 3rd party advertising banner.
B003WTE886|5.0|OMG I love, love, love Taylor Swift! She is so pretty. I personally give this album a two thumbs up.
B0001611DI|3.0|I have to say although I do actually like the movie for the most part, by all the trailers & given the tagline, the film is misrepresented as a serious dramatic horror-type film. I like a comedy to be a comedy & a horror film to be straight horror. This is why I don't like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It may be highly popular to a particular cult audience, but that doesn't mean it's all that good. I am strictly a fan of 70s horror films (so no unwarranted comments of how I don't or can't appreciate the classics/genre) which I wouldn't consider this one in that category exactly. I'd consider this more of an offbeat dark comedy with shades of drama figuring in to the mix.<br /><br />There was a good amount of attempted humor in Dawn of The Dead. I say attempted because I didn't find the blend of comedy amusing or necessary. I enjoyed the actors in the film with the exception of Scott Reiniger's character. I loved the shopping mall theme, etc...<br /><br />Again, I enjoyed the film for the most part & am pleased to have it in my DVD archives. I just wish it minimized the dark humor a bit. The bikers driving through the mall was a bit silly & over-the-top.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a horror film by any means. If you want horror, watch the original Night of the Living Dead. To compare a classic like that to something like this is laughable. Apples & oranges.<br /><br />I love spooks & chills & on that level Dawn of the Dead failed miserably. Certain reviewers has said the film is intended as a comedy. They must not have seen the tv spots & trailers like the rest of us did. That said, I didn't love it as I wanted to, however, it's still a good film which I did like. I just really wanted a horror film as was represented in the original movie ad, trailers, tv & radio spots.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Surprisingly not good movie. I couldn't get around the bad acting by the entire cast. I couldn't even watch the entire thing.
B00846WWVM|4.0|I got this game as the free app of the day and love it. The levels are challenging, but not too hard. The little people and the town your saving are so cute. I would recommend this app.

0440246008|5.0|When I start reading a Jack Reacher book I can't put it down.  The Reacher character acts out every person's dream of taking up for the &#34;underdog&#34; and striking back at those who abuse their power.  I've read every Lee Child 's Jack Reacher books and have not been disappointed.
1582701709|5.0|This book has being so uplifting to me.  It has helped me thru the day and made me realized that I can do all things thru Christ and that there is no limit as to what God can do.  Man is not control of my life, God is in control.  I would recommend this book

0143121006|4.0|I hadn't heard of this case until I read about the book being published, and it sounded interesting enough to give it a try. It's a good, solid telling of an unexpected murder set in a fascinating time in Peking. I found the writing compelling as the mystery was painstakingly recounted and examined, and the writer does an excellent job of setting the scene of Peking in the late 1930's with all its corruption, tension, and tangled politics of the time.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|So much stuff to buy you will love this game it is lime a racing adventure game because you go threw caves sand water and grass and finally snow I would rate this game a 5 already buy and have fun !!!!!!!

It is lacking some stuff though.<br /><br />Creative Mode: Awful on the kindle, add more blocks please.<br /><br />World Borders: The end of the world is bad. It's annoying when mining.<br /><br />Caves and ravines: Add them please!<br /><br />Settings: C'mon. There has to be a way to make brightness bright. And peaceful mode.<br /><br />Everything else is perfect. Good job mojang!
B00069FLC2|5.0|Purchased this DVD and must say that this is a great joy to listen to. Great picture and sound quality. There is some new material that no present on the Final tour with Cliff DVD.<br />One particular song displays the skill of the drummer Brian and is a treat to watch.

B008FPOIT6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Never thought much about typefaces or fonts and their history. This tale had me interested to go look for more info on them. Fun characters as well.
1416550550|1.0|A tedious read -- based on an implausible series of events with characters I'd prefer not to know.  This was a selection in my book club -- and most found it a waste of time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|add redstone torches so I can blow up my Tnt. you need to update so we can blow up Tnt!
0060556501|5.0|This book has been written for a child to understand. As I excepted I couldn't use it for toddlers or preschool.  I recommend the DVD cartoon version for this age.  I have found that the little ones love using it as a picture book
031236198X|5.0|It was an enjoyable read that provided simple but effective strategies in bringing any community together to develop plans in accomplishing its goals. This book has influenced my thinking in how I would plan to implement change in my workplace.  When a community decides to work together in effecting change then great things can happen
1596680180|5.0|This little book turned out to be so much more than I expected! It has great pictures and good instructions. It's also small enough to be carried in my purse. As a beginning Braider, I highly recommend it
B0000C1HLF|4.0|Lots of action and fun dialogue.....the girls are beautiful and the comedy is okay.  The editing is swift and the scenes never drag.
0345803485|1.0|This book does not cater to the young. I must say I read the first two and felt like it was a waste of time. I can see its appeal to women who want their men to take control in the bedroom but that's it. I myself am 23, inexperienced, and a recent college grad but I would never think the way Anna does. I don't care how hot or rich a guy is I would be more cautious of getting into a relationship with someone like Christian. There is just some much in this book that I can't deal with( none of it dealing with bdsm or sex) It's not even funny. there is a lot more i could state as to why i don't like this book but my head hurts just thinking about them. I'm  sorry but this did not sit well with me at all.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|A very fun and challenging game. A must have if you enjoy hidden objects game. Well worth the money spent on it.
0316010669|3.0|This is an interesting book that helps us understand this whole concept of 'thin slicing' - our ability to rapidly make sense of a situation based on very narrow slices of experiences. This is an ability all mentally healthy human beings have. Gladwell has done a half good job trying to dissect this phenomenon, helping us understand the it, conditions under which it is reliable, how and when it can get unreliable, and how to avoid the conditions that make them unreliable.<br /><br />It is well researched and written, and Gladwell covers a good amount of ground. There are plenty of references to scientific evidence, and delightfully painted portraits of men and women who have helped mankind understand what goes on inside of our brains.<br /><br />However structurally the book is a disappointment. It is not what I would call a \\"tight book\\". Concepts are not fully treated in the context they are introduced, and make appearances in subsequent chapters. E.g. the concept of priming is introduced in Chapter 2, and keeps making an appearance throughout the rest of the book in different forms and emphasis. After reading chapter 2 one would have thought the \\"Locked Door\\" of unconscious is for real and there's no way around it. Only to be told in Chapter 6 that with practise the experts learn to peer in and are able to develop a language to describe their feelings. The last chater \\"Conclusion - Listening with your eyes; the lessons of Blink\\" is anything but a summary of key takeaways from the book. He takes yet another plot line - how orchestra musician selection politics has fought to neutralize the natural biases - in another word how they have successfully contained the opposite of the Warren Harding effect. It would have been the best place to summarize the full plot and key take aways. Instead what we get is just one sub-problem in relation to the phenomenon the book is talking about.<br /><br />In summary, a thought provoking book that deals with a topic that every rational person should think through. The writing at the micro level is good, but at a macro level its flow and structure leaves a lot to be desired.
B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra does justice to every note, every word.  Alan and Marylin Bergman may not be household names like Cole Porter but their work is superb and memorable.
B0033TI4BW|5.0|I recommend it for people in the management area. It shows that intrinsic motivation is way more powerful than extrinsic motivation, specially on creative jobs like design and programming.

B004LROUW2|2.0|George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is a novel of socialism gone extreme where life itself has no meaning because meaning is a commodity controlled by government propaganda. Haruki Murakami's \\"1Q84\\", on the other hand, is a novel of isolation in the midst of Tokyo's crowded city streets where the meaning of life is derived from the internal landscape of each character, a meaning they then force upon one another through their actions, and sometimes inaction, in the shared fictional reality of their parallel worlds. \\"1Q84\\" is a dark, nightmarish expansion on the same counter-culturalism behind \\"Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\\". It is no mere coincidence that the central metaphor in both books is eschatology.<br /><br />In line with this, it is surprising how many reviewers have stumbled over Murakami's use of \\"The Little People\\" as a kind of shadowy, gothic villain. Murakami's \\"Little People\\" represent normal, everyday people driven by cruel necessity to manipulate their world in ways that help them survive. George Orwell's \\"Big Brother\\" is government gone astray while Murakami's almost elvish \\"Little People\\" are stand-ins for the faceless, nameless, hardworking masses driven to madness by the deprivations of social and cultural forces they cannot control and do not understand. This passage on page 236, for example, is one almost every reviewer quotes in whole or in part because it is here that Murakami himself (speaking through the character of Professor Ebisuno) explains the relationship between the two books, \\"George Orwell introduced the dictator Big Brother in his novel 1984, as I'm sure you know. The book was an allegorical treatment of Stalinism, of course. And ever since then, the term 'Big Brother' has functioned as a social icon. That was Orwell's great accomplishment. But now, in the real year 1984, Big Brother is all too famous, and all too obvious. If Big Brother were to appear before us now, we'd point to him and say, 'Watch out! He's Big Brother!' There's no longer any place for a Big Brother in this real world of ours. Instead, these co-called Little People have come on the scene. Interesting verbal contrast, don't you think?\\"<br /><br />On the surface, \\"1Q84\\" is a surreal love story of two people, Tengo and Aomame. Tengo is the grown son of a dedicated NHK subscription collector while Aomame is the grown daughter of a woman wholly and completely dedicated to the \\"Society of Witnesses\\". The adult Tengo teaches mathematics in a cram school for his daily bread while dreaming of being a novelist. For her day-job Aomame works as a martial arts instructor/physical therapist and spends her nights killing abusive husbands whose wives have fled their homes and are now under the care of a wealthy dowager. As adults the two do not know one another, but they went to the same elementary and middle schools. Because of their parents, in school both children were social outcasts whose paths became linked when Tengo intervened one day to stop Aomame from being bullied. Shy and reserved, that one rescue made them aware of one another but they never actually interacted until after cleaning the classroom one day when Aomame grabbed Tengo's hands, stared deep into his eyes, and then ran from the classroom in embarrassment. That event also marked the point when each child broke from the oppressive rule of their parents which in turn meant their paths would never cross again.<br /><br />That, however, is only the surface. The real story runs much deeper.<br /><br />Haruki Murakami was born in 1949, putting him firmly in the middle of the post-World War Two baby boom generation. Just like his American and European counterparts, for Murakami the core assumption has always been that the primary purpose of their generation was to redefine the world and through that redefinition to bring about a unified global culture. Unfortunately, like so many of his generation, Murakami cannot conceptualize a clear distinction between individualismand collectivism except for the simplistic understanding that individualism is rebellion against \\"the system\\". This dichotomy, this paradox, is what has driven Murakami's entire generation into embracing the single greatest collectivist social movement in the history of our world. The dark side of Murakami, the \\"shadows\\" he tried to cut in \\"Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\\" and having cut now seeks to explore in \\"1Q84\\" are nothing less than his generation's horrifying realization that they have failed to bring our world into the utopia of their dreams and through that failure, they have created an \\"end of the world\\" just as destructive of human potential as the global thermonuclear war nightmare they inherited from their parents.<br /><br />The destruction that so horrifies the baby boom generation is their perception of society being a fatal poison inflicted on their generation's human spirit. They have spent their entire lives seeking out that one narcotic, that one perfect sexual position, that one mystical piece of music, the one perfect sensual experience which will carry them away from the pain, guilt, and privilege of their lives and into a spiritual awakening capable of carrying them to the threshold of utopia. Consider, for example, this passage on page 242 where Aomame is contemplating the existential consequences of rape versus her own rape-free childhood, \\"But decent motives don't always produce decent results. And the body is not the only target of rape. Violence does not always take visible form, and not all wounds gush blood.\\"<br /><br />What the baby boom generation and its quest for enlightenment has failed to realize is that their own narcissism and self-absorbtion is, in fact, the chief cause of the psychic damage that so horrifies them. Tengo's father was trapped in an endless parade of Sundays spent going house-to-house seeking out radio and television owners who had not paid the required fees for NHK broadcasts. Aomame's mother had likewise dragged her through a childhood of identical Sundays only instead of service to NHK's quasi-governmental bureaucracy, Aomame's mother was a sincere follower of the \\"Society of Witnesses\\" seeking to warn a dying world of impending divine judgment. Now, as adults, just like their parents were trapped in lives of daily toil so are Tengo and Aomame. Their upbringing coupled with their devotion to not following in their parent's footsteps alongside their dedication to living life in accordance with their own internal reality, has trapped them in orbit around one another where they are constantly circling and never fulfilling the passion that has grown between them. The real question of the \\"Q\\" in \\"1Q84\\" is not the identity of the Little People, the coming of the end of the world, or the success of the book-within-a-book titled \\"Air Chrysalis\\". The real question behind the \\"Q\\" is what is stopping Aomame and Tengo from being together? The answer, of course, is their own refusal to seek each out.<br /><br />The Little People themselves finally make an appearance on page 249 emerging in the light of the alternate world's two moons from the mouth of a pedophile victim who Aomame's dowager friend has taken under her protective wing. The child is a girl found bruised and beaten in a train station after fleeing from Sakigake, a cult that up to now, has been pictured as mostly harmless but with odd, evil overtones. Fuka-Eri, the writer of the book \\"Air Chrysalis\\" that Tengo rewrote in order to insure it would win a contest, is the daughter of Professor Ebisuno's friends, the Fukuda family. The Professor has not been able to contact her parents in several years. He fears they are imprisoned within the cult compound after having been supplanted by someone as religiously radical as his friends were politically radical. The appearance of this girl (named Tsubasa) here late in the first book as a victim of violent, vicious rape at the hands of an unidentified messianic newSakigake leader, takes us a step closer to discovering what great trauma Fuka-Eri endured right before she fled the cult and her parents vanished. To have the Little People make their first appearance from the mouth of this victim is grotesquely ironic, moving Murakami ever closer to tradition of writers like Tanizaki Junichiro, a tradition Murakami early in his writing career was dedicated to breaking away from.<br /><br />He doesn't stop there, of course, he builds further by having the Little People engage in their signature activity, building an air chrysalis, \\"Then they sat in a circle around the object and started feverishly working on it. It was white and highly elastic. They would stretch their arms out and, with practiced movements, pluck white, translucent threads out of the air, applying them to the fluffy, white object, making it bigger and bigger.\\"<br /><br />A few pages later (page 251), Murakami uses similar language to describe Tengo as he works on an original story he hopes to publish, \\"Writing at night for the first time in ages, though, using a ballpoint pen and paper, Tengo found his mind working smoothly. His imagination stretched out its limbs and the story flowed freely. One idea would link naturally with the next almost without interruption, the tip of the pen raising a persistent scrape against the white paper. Whenever his hand tired, he would set the pen down and move the fingers of his right hand in the air, like a pianist doing imaginary scales.\\"<br /><br />This kind of parallel language in two scenes only a few pages apart occurs frequently throughout the story. By invoking similar metaphors in this way Murakami is using one storyline to expand the depth and breadth of the other. In this particular case, he is intentionally creating a sense of magic in both the creation of the air chrysalis and the writing of Tengo's new story. This congruence also builds on one of the underlying principle themes running throughout the story, a theme that is common in almost everything Murakami writes because it is key to the worldview of his entire generation. Taking their clues from Vonnegut and Kerouac, the baby boom generation accepts as an almost divine truth the Aristotelian ideal of the sacredness of all forms of art and creative venture. The plain, simple life of Tengo's hardworking NHK fee collecting father is not for them. This generation as a whole has long assumed that they are more evolved than their parents. Being more evolved also means they feel more entitled to live better and enjoy greater wealth without the backbreaking, knuckle busting, sweaty labor of their parents.<br /><br />One of the thinly veiled condescensions running throughout \\"1Q84\\" and so many other literary works written by baby boomers is disdain for anyone who dares to criticize their artistry or their way of life. And yet, at the same time, like Tengo and Aomame, they have nothing but disdain for the way of life embodied in their hardworking, industrious parents. Earlier writers (such as Soseki in Japan and Fitzgerald in America) felt that same sense of personal evolution but they did not treat honest work as something too far beneath their station to even consider. Just the opposite, in fact. In both Soseki and Fitzgerald hard, honest work was both a means to an end and an important aspect of a character's moral development. But not here. No, in \\"1Q84\\" honest work serves merely as a cover for the far more important tasks of Tengo's fiction writing and Aomame's assassination of abusive husbands. So it is not surprising in the least when on page 252, Tengo has this thought, \\"The concept of duty always made Tengo cringe. He had lived his life thus far skillfully avoiding any position that entailed responsibility, and to do so, he was prepared to endure most forms of deprivation.\\"<br /><br />In the end, \\"1Q84\\" becomes something I had hoped to never see Murakami attach his name to, an existential exercise in nihilism, a form of literary masturbation. I stopped reading Murakami when he came out with \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\" because when I skimmed through that book in either English or Japanese (at the time my Japanese was much better than it is now!) I could see right away that a profound change had occurred in Murakami's approach to writing. Where \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" and \\"Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\\" had been playful, metaphorical flights of fantasy, \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\" was dull, dreary, and about as entertaining as watching a dog chase its own tail. \\"1Q84\\" has much in common with \\"Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\\". Both books are explorations in the schizophrenic nature of life in the modern world, both books are dark treatises on the failure of the modern world to live up to the baby boomer's utopian ideals, and both books carry the writer's own fear of death into a metaphorical and nightmarish exploration of eschatology. However, \\"1Q84\\" feels less like a brilliant, visual mind playing with ideas and more like a dark, brooding condemnation of life itself. For all his obvious hatred of the \\"Society of Witnesses\\", in \\"1Q84\\" Murakami reveals that he and they share a common philosophy: life is cruel and the reason it is cruel is because the human race is mostly composed of self-destructive idiots.Sakigake leader, takes us a step closer to discovering what great trauma Fuka-Eri endured right before she fled the cult and her parents vanished.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|\\"Sexing\\" \\"cupping my sex\\"? Nobody would say that, ever. It sounds horrible and UN romantic! The main character is naive as a 18 year old, and has graduated college? The writer clearly lost her virginity a long time ago and can't write from the view point of a real virgin. Characters are UN realistic. Expected more from such media hype. Very disappointed!

B00AL0RSBS|5.0|I really like this album. It has a variety of songs on it. There are some sad ones too. I like them all. It has been the only CD I've listened to since it arrived.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Good movie. Great cast, very well filmed kept us entertained the entire length of the movie.  A great rent and definite must-see!
B000B6CO52|5.0|My 7 year old discovered this movie on television a while back, and he loved it.  I watched it with him recently, and had forgotten how good it is.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable!  Never mind the Brits.... and Americans and other aliens.  The inferences to blockbuster movies was priceless.  I've almost always appreciated a dry sense of humor.  And God bless Adam.  Nature or nurture?
B0045HCJSK|5.0|I wanted this movie for several reasons;John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and don't forget Walter Brennan.<br />I remember this movie from my childhood and I never get tired of it.Plus Ricky sings alittle bit, and I had a crush on him!<br />One of my many favorite John Wayne flicks.
0385349947|5.0|Through Chapter 2 only, but liking the \\"pep talk\\" so much that I already see myself reading it again. Like many books these days, the content is light and anecdotal, but her reflections do seem to strike at the core of the issue for working women today.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I bought this book regardless of the reviews.  I have read most of the book, but I'm not riveted and definitely wouldn't say it is a page turner.  If you want to laugh a lot, stick with Chelsea Handler's books!
B000035Z3K|5.0|This DVD of dracula has the original 1931 theatrical version as well as a version with a relatively new score which fills the movie from beginning to end with music and complements it nicely in my opinion in part by sounding as though it could have been composed in the '30's, although ultimately you can't beat the original for the creepy/eerie mood it creates with its silences. I've yet to watch the spanish language version made at the same time which is also on here w/subtitles.
0783231202|5.0|I know this is a oldie but with Morgan Freeman,Anthony Hopkins, Djimon and Matthew in it how could it go wrong. I am glad I got this it lets you know alot about slavery in other countries and reminds us the price men paid to be free.Shocking movie and great ending!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it when I first got it I played it for at least 4 5 hours until.  I had to eat
1936891026|5.0|Really loved this. As the McKee says in the foreword, I really felt that this book was written for me!
1439152802|4.0|The person I gave it to  for her birthday really enjoyed and now it is my turn to read it!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|When i first saw this flick I liked it.Hugh Jackman is one of my favorite actors since xmen.He plays a great role in this action pack adventure. It makes you go away with love for the robotics and thrill of the fight.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I was looking for something different to play. I usually play poker, slots,or hidden objects. This is fun and a change of pace. It is a bit addicting.so be warned.
1616550414|5.0|I'd reccomend this for any zelda fan, 5 stars.<br /><br />Worth it alone for the timeline.<br /><br />also, word requirements are stupid.
1451627297|2.0|...about 400 pages too long.  Some sections are certainly more interesting than others.  Each might have stood alone as their own novel/novella. At the end, I was relieved to finish and depressed that the 880 page dance ended with a waltz.  You'll see what I mean.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I am a fan of the Bat ! I have all the Batman dvd's in my collection. Christian Bale is an excellent Batman, I also have the sequele really good flic alot of action. A must for all  comic book hero collectors.I like all the new toys and gadgets Batman put in this movie with alot of action!
B0034G4OUO|4.0|Dwayne Johnson aka \\"The Rock\\" plays a \\"Terminator\\"ish no- nonsense ex-con bent on seeking revenge on those who murdered his brother.<br /><br />No punches were pulled and considering this is supposed to be an action movie there was much more drama than expected.<br /><br />The movie felt somewhat plausible and there are twists that make sense.<br /><br />More character development of \\"The Rock's\\" character would have been helpful but the film kept my attention throughout it's entirety.<br /><br />Recommend checking this film out.
078322799X|4.0|Michael J. Fox did a fantastic job in this movie. It arrived on time and in great condition. I love the music too!
B007R41E8O|5.0|Alawar is coming out with some really good quality games lately. The screens stretch for easy hidden object find. The visuals are really nice, great story line and long enough for my monies worth. Thank you!!! Keep them coming.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|First time I saw this movie I said I got to have it ! Alot of action and interesting plot good special effects.If you are a comicbook buff you would like this! Don't let him touch you he talks to the dead and they talk back!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved how this book lead me to think. Time is counted so we can appreciate it. Makes me  want to share time with those who are precious to me.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|This season of Supernatural arrived on time and in great condition. So glad too, because it was a birthday present for my daughter. Thank you!
B006G3JPWO|5.0|I love these characters and how creatively done the whole movie comes together. Disney has such awesome sets and special effects. I come back to it every Halloween and it never gets old.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|I bought this dvd because I enjoyed the first Ghost Rider movie and I wanted to add this to my collection.I like both episodes and it is one of those Flics you look at over and over again.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This is so good. I have listened to it so many times sense I have purchased it. I am thankful for the fast shipping and quality of your product. I am happy with my purchase and may think of you in the future.
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed the story part of the book .Not to much into all the sex. I think it's a good read,easy read.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I was surprised with the content of this movie. It was totally entertaining as I followed the lives of the characters. It was motivating and very well written and moved right along. I got a full experience by the end of the film.
B002GHHHP6|4.0|I got this dvd because I have never seen and I am a Gibson and Garner fan!I like to collect old westerns and thought this would be interesting. Very nice twist at the end, did not see it coming!Humorous at times and good flick to own.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I really enjoy this game. The artwork is so beautiful and compared to similar games much more elaborate. With so many different categories I can play it over and over again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All of these books were so good.  Very well written, and this final book ended exactly the way I had hoped.
B004EHZPEG|3.0|I look for books that will generate new behaviors. I am designing games for salespeople, so video gaming is not my forte - this book fortunately only builds on such a foundation, but author's insights are relevant to me too - you just have to learn to quickly browse through non-relevant stuff.<br />One absolutely impressive thing about this book is breadth of topics that game-designers are (or should) be inspired by. It has nothing to do with studying other games / game designers. That is awesome approach (especially note about Alexander and his Language of Patterns - sounds like a great food for thought).
B0034G4P80|5.0|The first time I saw it I did not get it! I enjoyed it more the second time around. Good flic with action and I think I am A Chris Hemsworth fan!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is addicting but a lot of fun. You gather coins that you use to purchase objects or advantages in the game. You must put all of your attention into it and I guarantee you'll love it.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|After being told about Mankell, and Jo Nesbo, by my Uncle in England , I have come to really enjoy the writing of these Nordic writers and the characters in the Wallander series. The story in this book is especially engaging with the melding of family and espionage. To have the lead character be so faulted makes it more real and interesting. Wallander, the character, can easily frustrate the reader and leave you wondering about his fitness as a policeman. The combination of having a relationship with the subject of the disappearance and the complications of Wallander making mistakes make you wonder whether he will trip himself up or even be taken away from the investigation. This pulls you into the story further and his failings make you want him to pull it together and lead you down to the solution. Reading about Sweden's people and landscape make for a nice introduction to the country and will lead me to read more of Mankell' s books.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|It isn't anything too in depth, but is a lot of fun. Good way to waste some time waiting around for any reason.
B002OMZTSK|5.0|I found this book entertaining and enjoyable although a bit lacking in depth. I enjoyed the story line and could relate to the characters. I would recommend this book to other casual readers.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Love this game. Would recommend to anyone. Keeps you in total surprise all the time while playing.  Everyone needs to try this game
B004LROUW2|5.0|Hard to put down - a story that keeps on unfolding. Just as you begin to think you understand what's going on, there's a shift. A new reality? When did it shift the first time?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this app solely because of the almost 5 star ratings it already has. Why use an app when your Kindle Fire HD already keeps you updated on battery life but this app tells you much more!! It informs you how much time you have left for such actions as listening to music, watching films or just reading. It looks great being very \\"visual\\"'<br />A great app, which is free, and one I would fully recommend. I have put in my phone and my husband has put it on his i-pad.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Movie is over all pretty bad,  but the effects work is amazing.  The movie is worth the watch just for that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this ap.  The only thing is I'm trying to figure out how to put it on the device so it can be read offline.
B0086WQNZ0|5.0|Following the previous success by Amazon issued in 2008 with 20 CDs, this set of Bach by Gould shall be a great hit. As one of a fan of  JS Bach and G Gould, and though one who missed to get the previous one, I had a big chance to keep this in my CD rack. But I re-checked my CD rack, and I found a half of 44s was here on my rack. I remember I  got them at 10 times higher price one by one.  I feel sorry for the composer and the player and their music,  sold many times in a different way.  5 Stars.
B002PJN59M|5.0|Great adaptation of the king Arthur story. Good actors and a little Merlin action too. Saw this quite a while ago and was really happy to see it available. Recommend.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I tolerated the first book but the story should have ended there. It's like reading the diary of a 14 year- old. Ugh! And so freaking repetitive !! I started skipping through Ana's introspective moments because they were basically the same multi-page thought process over...and over...and over...and over...and everything is so ridiculously over the top, it's like watching \\"The Young & The Restless\\".<br /><br />Not for me!
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|It may be the best Bowie LP ever...<br /><br />If yur 50+ buy this now!<br /><br />I wish I could have turned the LP over. (7 on each side)
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I love having my SmartTV and access to the internet, then all I need is Amazon, so I can go to the Instant Video section and have movies sent straight to my TV! Doesn't get much better than that!
B008TRUDAS|2.0|Although this book was a very easy read , it was a little predictable.  Nice characters, might read author again.
0345803485|2.0|The first time I read this I didn't know what to expect and was pretty engaged to the storyline. However, reading it a 2nd time it was only ok and was getting annoyed with the repetitive details. I'm sure Twilight fans will love this book.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|I never saw this original and it was replayed on late night TV shows for years.  Finally got to see it and was engaged from beginning to end, and fell in love with Joan Crawford again.  I think she won an Academy Award for this.  Perfect actress for the part.  Hollywood needs to get back to writing these melodramas about and for women again.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  It was a great story that I could not put down.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I think I liked this book,better than 1, the shifting now & then was well executed I love how it brought the story together . I have read 2 books in a week that's fast for me , starting requiem now
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|The object of the game is pretty simple and the controls are very easy bit it is very challenging to  maneuver to where you want and catch all the smaller blobs without touching the larger ones
B000F1IQN2|2.0|Bought the DVD after reading in the message boards of a movie site how good it was.  That it was one of Spielberg's best.  But after about 20-30 minutes, I was bored out of my mind.  There is practically no action.  A lot of planning and plotting, and I could hardly hear what the actors spoke.  Some of it is subtitled, which is annoying to try to read the quick moving words and concentrate on the acting.  Not suspenseful.  Just a boring movie.  Glad I didn't see it when it first came out.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Fun and cannot put down when you start as usual.<br />I love Sophie Kinsella's books and this one does not disappoint me.
B0072AVM6W|5.0|This is a difficult to locate book, especially in a public library as people tend to abscond with it...  It has wonderful timeless information!
B00973902K|5.0|my boyfriend sing this to me all the time he love this song this want we do all the to each other we call each other that i feel when i meet him when i gave him my number
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather ap Comes up quick, is easy to use. My husband uses it to check the radar before he goes out to plow snow. Good way to keep track of the storm.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Highly recommend reading this book.  It gives great insight to finding our true self.  So much to be Learned in this book.
B004QMYKSG|4.0|The album is pretty good throughout. I heard &#34;Young Blood&#34; on a episode of a television show I was watching, and investigated who sang it, and ended up buying the whole album. &#34; Young Blood&#34;  in my opinion is the best song.
B0073U2FB2|5.0|This movie was so much better than I thought it'd be. I expected some decent b-movie on a scyfy channel level but this was one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It's perfectly terrifying in parts and not only uplifting but inspiring in others. The acting seems completely natural to all parties involved and the special effects are amazing.<br /><br />The plotline is pretty simple, a group of survivors in the wake of an invisible electricity alien invasion are making their way across Moscow in hopes of getting to a submarine that has other survivors. They have to rely on stealth, wits and a ridiculous amount of courage to get across the landscape that's filled with seemingly invincible and almost completely invisible aliens.<br /><br />This movie was such an insane amount of fun to watch that I almost watched it immediately again after it ended. It's perfect to watch by yourself or with a group of friends. I'm sure there's some plot holes or parts to make fun of if you over think it but if you're watching a movie to enjoy it, it's amazing.
0812993357|3.0|I purchased this book after many people in the fashion industry suggested it. I must say I was not expecting it to be so dull. The writing is plain and non imaginative. It's like sitting around just reading 'facts' about Ms. Coddington's life. Even her anecdotes come across without emotion and she clearly leaves a lot out. Not impressed.
B00B23O96A|1.0|What a piece of crap from a rock icon. I had reservations about this cd when I looked at the song list, but I love Clapton. I could barely get thru the first listen. Next release \\" Clapton sings Disney Favorites\\".
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|If you are a fan of David Bowie, regardless of the era, you have to buy this record.  I'm not going to do a song by song review as that tends to get tedious, but this is a welcome return to form by Bowie.  Definitely his best music since \\"Scary Monsters\\".  Get the extended version if you can, as the three bonus tracks are worth it.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Let me say first that if this book is indeed self published, I'll take a moment to thank the author for trying.<br /><br />The thank yous stop there.<br /><br />I am relieved - very relieved - that I was able to find some 1 and 2 star reviews on here. Because I honestly did not like this book, and reading them helped me realize I was not alone, was not crazy for thinking so! Because from all the good I'd heard, I began to think so when I got to reading the book myself.<br /><br />The story itself doesn't make sense - from beginning to end. Such lack of continuity. I don't give spoilers and I won't, but characters in the first half of the book seemingly disappear from the second half (with only one mention) and there is no closure to that. I hate that as a reader. Instead of the characters I thought they were, they were merely pawns to the story it seems. Very disposable.<br /><br />As for the main characters, I don't like them at all. Sky's language, personality, and lack of self worth scare me. Very much. I'm appauled by much of what I read. I realize she is 17, but even taking that into consideration, her actions scare me. She's so unnatural. It's uncomfortable really, because it's like she's cardboard, and you are supposed to take her as substance.<br /><br />Holder - he scares me. I agree with the other reviewer that went into depth into this - he's actually really creepy! I would have run so far away from him. And to echo the other reviewers - no 18 year old boy would ever, ever say the stuff that he did. Hell you can't get a 28, 38, 48 year old man say those things. They are impractical, unreal, and to believe them as real is almost insulting. In fact, pretty much all the writing and dialogue was so forced, so horribly unnatural - I am surprised I got through it.<br /><br />The sex scenes were uncomfortable, and I found them very disturbing to read. Instead of reading about a love story, I just feel like these characters are being used and using one another. Ifeel less love and more something unnatural, I'm not sure if I'm alone.<br /><br />I think that's what I take away from the book. I found it insulting at times. Insulting of my intelligence. I did not know it was a young adult book when I started - it was recommended to me on a message board. I probably would not have read it if I had without reading some reviews in advance. I'm only thankful it was a $3.99 special.<br /><br />I've given the book 2 stars because I've never given 1 star to a book I finished, and I did make it through this book just to see where it all ended up.  I will not read again and I will not be someone to recommend it, that's for sure. And I do hope mothers take warning. This is not something I would want my young adult reading.

B002QHH22O|5.0|Hello, if you are reading this you probably already love Steel Panther. They are awesome, so the downloadable album should not be confusing for you. If you have never heard them, I am not going to rate their music. They rock. Unless you are prudish. Check them out on youtube or something. Personally, I have seen them live twice and love them, but this review, I guess, is for the download. If you are a prude or easily offended, do NOT listen to Steel Panther because you WILL be disturbed.
B003DXSXCI|3.0|It was a good movie of the time..not so much now..even the famous chase scene is pretty lame with the Mustang & Charger

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I was a big fan of Chunk of Change and Manners, and this album continues in the same kind of music. It is extremely unique and the lyrics are meaningful and the music is just amazing. One of their best albums (they are all indistinguishably perfect).

0451147960|3.0|I am a fan of Ken Follett's writings. He has a way of spinning a tale that quickly pulls in the reader yet you are given opportunities to appreciate his style of prose. In my book this is a winning combination. \\"The Modigliani Scandal\\" is one of Follett's earliest works. It was written under a pseudonym. You put these two facts together & you can understand that the author was in the early stages of developing his storytelling muscle. I would agree with the the sentiment from an earlier reviewer that mediocre Follett is better than a great deal of the literature that is out there. But, to each his (or her) own. My only disappointment with the story is it's rather abrupt & awkward ending. And by ending I mean the last page. It made me feel as if my copy of the book was missing pages.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|totally amazing I absolutely love it I would get it even if it coated 5 bucks it is so fun great game
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I will never regret getting this game. I love it. Not gonna lie, I got 'scared' once or twice. And it was exhilarating. I just think the creator should make some more maps. Other than that, I think it's totally awesome.

1439102732|2.0|Zoe Baxter, a musician and music therapist, desperately wants a child of her own. She and husband Max have been married for 9 years, and have spent the majority of that time (and their finances) trying to conceive. After one stillbirth and a series of miscarriages, Zoe insists on trying again as soon as possible, but the years of stress and disappointment have taken their toll on Max. A few months later, they get divorced.<br /><br />After they separate, Max becomes a lost soul, slipping into alcoholism and relying heavily on the charity and goodwill of his brother, Reid, and his sister-in-law, Liddy. The two are evangelical Christians who attend the Eternal Glory Church, a rather fanatical organization that reminds me very much of the Westboro Baptist Church. Although Max initially resists his benefactors' efforts to convert him, a narrow escape with death convinces him to \\"see the light\\" and become a born-again Christian.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Zoe, who, at 40, suddenly realizes that she's bisexual, finds the new love of her life in Vanessa, a counselor at a local high school. After a few months of dating, they get married in Massachusetts and decide to start a family using the frozen embryos remaining from Zoe's previous childbearing efforts. The problem? The embryos are jointly owned by both Zoe and Max, and neither can do a thing with them without the other's permission. Max, who has been reduced to a brain-washed zombie by his new affiliates, counters that he wants to donate the embryos to his brother and sister-in-law, who are also infertile and want children. What follows is a free-for-all court case that will determine custody for the embryos.<br /><br />Although I know it isn't fair to compare an author's book to one of her previous novels, I can't help but think of My Sister's Keeper, simply because it was the first Picoult novel I ever read. In Keeper, which also centers on a court case with a controversial issue at stake, Picoult gives each family member a fair chance to express themselves in their tragic situation. Sing You Home, on the other hand, deploys its characters as pawns in the author's political agenda than as actual people.<br /><br />Like a reverse image of Francine Rivers' Atonement Child, this novel almost resembles a boxing match: in one corner, you have Zoe and Vanessa's noble cause (the fight for gay adoption rights) while in the other corner, the villainous evangelical Christians use Max as a puppet to further their own devious agenda. Oh, the humanity. With flat characters and the author's own tremendous bias shining through every page, Sing You Home really is a sad travesty that could have been so much better.<br /><br />That said, though, the author also made the decision to collaborate with a musician (Ellen Wilber) to provide a soundtrack for the novel. Filled with gentle, folksy music, it's really quite lovely to listen to. So even if my review of the book drives you away, do give it a listen here: [...].s themselves in their tragic situation.

B00AIBZJLG|2.0|We have seen the Cirque Du Soleil shows in Las Vegas and loved them all. This movie is simply a video of exerps of those shows and loses the impact of the live performances. After the first 20 minutes it was rather boring.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It woud be nice if u coud get viligrs and  ender men and infanit terain please do tht<br />YOU NEED THE UPDATE
B0035LGXXO|4.0|I'll admit that I watched this totally out peer pressure and to gain insight into many inside stories/jokes I was not \\"in on\\" over the years but the film is worth at least one viewing.  The acting and dialogue are fairly atrocious but the setting and landscape of New York that the film portrays are what makes it worth it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|When I first got my kindle fire I got a roocase which I thought I liked at first. This is the case my husband got and after using his kindle with this case I realized how much more I liked it than mine. Its nice and thin and does not feel cheap at all. I love the white and it looks really sharp on the kindle fire.
B001EL6EHC|4.0|For fans of this movie, this is a must have product. The movie is classic and timeless and plenty has been written so no need for further discussion there.
B00A757EFW|4.0|My son likes it. It brings back old memories of when my brother used to play it.  So when I downloaded it, he thought it was fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener is a great product, worked well on pocket knives.  Good product at a good price.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This is definitely a 5 Star movie. Recommend it. A funny and heart warming story, but funny at the same time.
B0090SI42Y|4.0|\\"While some critics might disagree with me on this, The Man with the Iron Fists, in all its cheesy, ultra-violent glory makes a more conventional and surprisingly interesting effort than Kill Bill. Kill Bill, its sister film from the presenter of this film Quentin Tarantino, has its intriguing parts with anime and action but lacks a sense of direction and consistency.<br /><br />Iron Fists' is Wu Tang Clan's the RZA's first effort and deals with a trio of three fighting spirits, one a blacksmith, one a neglected warrior, and one a sleazy traveler/assassin who tries to secure gold from a brigade of bandits. The film, in my opinion, is better than what the critics say which have often tend to lean negative or mixed on it. What it does strongly is provide a very wicked, superfluous sense of style and direction in its narrative and something compact and grand about its plot devices and action too. Yet, amid its pluses, lies a rather formulaic, occasionally ill-paced, uneven use of Mandarin and Cantonese with English, and sometimes forgettable film that can mostly go away out of your critical mind if watching it in the background and drinking beer with a few mates.<br /><br />Thankfully, the never-seen-in-theaters DVD version expands more of its dense yet simple environment allows the audience more into the world of what the RZA pays homage to in terms of classic Asian martial arts cinema like Bruce Lee. Another nod to the RZA for trying to bring something wild and silly enough that it counteracts with the kind of same-old action movies these days that are full of white noise, like Taken 2, and lack a sense of uniqueness.<br /><br />A word of advisory goes is those reading, please by all means do not take this film very seriously unless you are one who believes in the philosophies of the Wu Tang Clan or promote Buddhism, only at certain parts.\\"
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great story, well written and totally believable.  I hope to read more books by this author.  The excerpt from 'Kiss' was intriguing.  I can't wait for it to come out this spring.  Keep up the good work Mira.  Janice Mote
B00846REIS|2.0|I know there are only so many scenarios a writer can come up with. But Ms. Day surely ripped us off with this copy cat of FSOG. I wished she would have started the copying somewhere in the middle of the plot, not the first few pages. Chapter 1 and I KNOW I will not be purchasing other 2 books.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This has to be my favorite show on prime time TV.  It gets better and better every season. The acting is superb!!!
B008VBYN80|5.0|Entertaining but it's slow and the diamonds are ridiculous I'm sorry but I will not pay for anything in a game with my money. Also joining a guild is a pain in the a$$ I've tried a few and it never works.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|This is probably one of the most important movies of the 20th century.  It's a perfect example of how dark humor coupled with political satire can produce something truly unique.  Those expecting gags, slapstick, and obvious jokes served to the audience on a silver platter should look elsewhere (not that silly humor is bad, I'm not a snob, but I can't exist on a diet of American Pie and Three Stooges all the time, y'know?).<br /><br />Anyway, without trying to overdo this article- the film looks great, the bonus features are interesting, the only slight gripe is with the packaging.  I don't like paper/cardboard DVD or Blu-ray cases, personally, but considering the price is right, I'd say this film is worth it.
1781164266|4.0|So I buy a lot of art books every year for and it's nice to get one with great illustration .
B002A9VJ40|5.0|Just watched it again after many, many years.  For a film made almost 30 years ago, it is pretty damn well made.  The special effects one of the best, even for today's standards, or should I say especially for today's standards (I just think a lot of movies these days have crappy effects).  The movie also does not seem or feel dated at all, like it could have easily been made more recently.  And Tom Cruise, what can I say...the guy looked good then, still does, and just doesn't seem to age.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a very fun and original game.  If you have played Flow on PS3, you'll probably love Osmos.  One minor gripe is the game requires a three finger touch to access the menu.  Not that big of an issue unless you're on a 1st gen Fire...
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Granted, almost any film looks better in 1080p, but everything in this movie jumps out like never before.  Sound and picture quality are amazing.  Yes, the majority of the film was made with CGI and special effects considered to be primitive by today's standards, but there is a surprising amount of detail obscured by previous releases.  Supplemental features are also well done.  There's some worthwhile material included from previous releases and newer materials that are very interesting if you get into the 'making of' documentaries and things of that sort.  Considering the lengths cast and crew went to to make this film look like nothing previously seen, it does shine an interesting light on the amount of time and elbow grease that went into making this film as stunning as it is.<br /><br />Granted, if you've never seen this movie before don't expect this to top other films (sci-fi and otherwise) in terms of 'greatest movie ever.'  There are details than can easily be nitpicked in terms of plot, dialogue, and so forth. However, for sheer entertainment value this can't be beat, especially with Amazon's prices.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|My boyfriend and I both really love this game. It's challenging and fun to play, with relaxing music to listen to while you play. I definitely recommend this for anyone.
B0036UMM84|5.0|Watched a few minutes just for the memories and then decided the memories weren't as great as I thought they were.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett's duets with musicians of all styles rock! My favorite is &#34;the Lady is a tramp&#34; with Lady Gaga! the accompaniment is terrific too.
B001EN71CW|5.0|In terms of technical details, this Bluray release looks better than ever.  Sound and picture quality are sharp.  I've read some reviews complaining about not having an extremely dynamic range of sound, but everything I watch doesn't have to shake my teeth loose and blow up the surround sound subwoofer.<br /><br />The bonus features are a little disappointing.  Everything from the DVD release is included plus a new roundtable discussion with Joss Whedon and various cast members, but I was hoping for a little more.  It's still a five star rating for me due to the fact that the show itself is more exciting and engaging than many others that are still on the air and have had the luxury to 'jump the shark.'  There's plenty of action, suspense, romance, humor, and everything else that makes good TV worth watching.  If the idea of a science fiction show that draws a large amount of inspiration from classic westerns appeals to you in any way, you'll most certainly enjoy everything about this show.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is amazing! Hot girls, funny dudes and some good songs. Overall a great idea for a date or movie night with some friends
B000J159N8|5.0|This movie is expertly crafted and shows the reality of modern warfare. I hope those who watch this come away with the realization that video games and movies are not like real war, (present movie excluded) and that battle is not fun nor 'cool' and should be as a LAST RESORT only. The world seems to think that \\"order out of chaos\\" is the path to peace, but war is and always will be about DEATH. Is this really what we want in our streets? I hope our 'elected' officials think twice about trying to get the USA and even the world into civil warfare so that the New World Order can take over fully...
B009X01ELC|5.0|This is my fourth case solution, and Marware finally got it so right! The leather is soft and plush, reminding me of a high end dayplanner...if you spent $100us on it. The retention shell is robust yet thin. The swivel is small and works flawlessly. The stand portion works very well...I am using it while typing this review. I am totally thrilled with this product, and bet you will be, too! Kudos Marware!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|In this set you'll get the theatrical & director's cuts for all movies.  Picture and sound quality are great.  All of the excellent bonus features from previous releases are present, plus a few more that sweeten the deal.  Nothing in the extras feels like filler.  I wish other studios would treat their franchises this well.<br /><br />Big-box retailers sell this set from anywhere from $50-$80.  Unless some store has a better price, you probably won't see it any cheaper than here.<br /><br />I'd hardly consider it to be the best part, but the packaging is much less annoying than the &#34;Alien Quadrillogy&#34; box set, too.
B006JD48NM|4.0|I bought this movie for my husband, who is a die-hard race fan.  As he watched it, i became interested too.  Ayrton Senna was a young and handsome Formula One racer.  He was hugely popular and was outspoken with racing and racetrack issues.  He was a 3-time world champion.<br />It was a very sad moment in the movie when this vital young man was killed in a racing accident.  I know my husband would recommend this movie to fellow auto racing fans.
B000AYEL1A|3.0|[[ASIN:B000AYEL1A A Star is Born]]  This is a wonderful movie that I saw many, many years ago.  The reason that I bought this movie is because of its stars-=Barbra Streisen and Kris Kristofferson.  The music is wonderful and as a teen, I fell in love with Kris Kristofferson.  The DVD that I received has good picture quality, but the sound is not good.  I am sorry about that. If I could lip read, I could enjoy the dialog and music a whole lot more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is fun but not violent. I could play it for hours. I have recomened it many to times.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I would recommend this movie to almost anyone.  The easiest way to describe this movie is like a cynic's version of &#34;Close Encounters&#34; with a pinch of &#34;The Goonies&#34; thrown in for flavor.  For a movie that tries to combine emotional scenes with some great action set-pieces, Super 8 succeeds.  It's a big-budget blockbuster with a happy ending, but it's at least my opinion that this movie is one of the best of its kind.<br /><br />The story is interesting, even if you change the channel when all of those 'true UFO stories' shows are on.  Sure, stories of aliens, government conspiracies, and small towns helplessly caught in larger problems are nothing new, but telling the story with a cast of younger actors puts a different perspective on this type of sci-fi.  The acting is great.  It seems like those responsible for casting took their time to find actors both young and old who really make every scene shine. It's not just padding between action sequences.  The action and special effects are great.  Real-world and digital effects mix well in this movie, and both complement the other instead of looking fake or helplessly cheesy.<br /><br />This movie may be more mature than it appears on the surface.  If you're a parent, there is cursing, violence, and the alien in the film is pretty creepy for most of the film.  Despite appearing this way you eventually learn that much of the alien's behavior has to do with the manner in which he/she/it was treated- unlike some of the worst sci-fi at least there's a reason for things being the way that they are.  Those with children that are young and/or easily scared may want to look elsewhere.  Be warned, this is one of those movies that's going to try and tug at your heart-strings.  If you dislike films that aim for the 'Spielberg' ending this one is most certainly not for you (kind of hard to avoid since he was the producer after all).<br /><br />Granted, this movie didn't re-invent the wheel as far as movie making orstory writing is concerned, but it is highly entertaining.  The first time I saw it I had to resist the urge to watch it again immediately.  Very few movies do that to me.
0765325950|5.0|Finally the end. It was almost worth the very long wait. Ok it was worth the wait. Lol I was happy and sad at the end......
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I just don't understand the bad reviews.  This is a great movie, a must see, amazing in so many ways.  I'm going to watch it over and over again, and it's good clean fun, appropriate for any age.  I love it!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Haven't had an occasion to actually use it. Thought if I went on a trip it might work although usually rooms have them.
0345803485|1.0|I'm glad I am not the only reviewer who finds this book less than acceptable. All I can say is \\"fire-starter\\". If one were REALLY to burn books, this would be the one to burn. It is beyond poorly written. I seriously contemplated ripping out the pages and using them in my fireplace this winter as fire-starter material. Of course, with all due respect - I did not really do this but I did rid myself of this piece of junk almost as quickly as I began to read it and realized \\"how bad, bad writing can be\\".
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have season one as well and I have read all the books. The first season pretty much followed the books. This second season began diverging from the books in the first episode and continued throughout. The basic story line is the same, just certain details have been changed. I'm curious as to how they will continue the story with these changes? They also seemed to speed up the story a bit. I wonder if the last book (or books) will be written in time for the show to continue at the rate they are going?
1589795474|2.0|Once you've read the preview, the rest is reiteration of the same message given to you in boringly huge doses.
B002APU580|2.0|Poor adaptation, it really does not do any justice to the book! The portrayal of Eliza Bennett was shallow and besides the cinematography and Dame Judy's portrayal of Lady Catherine, I found it really tedious. It felt like it had been made in a hurry with poor attention to detail. Would recommend the 1985 version and the Colin Firth version to anyone who wants to watch a good adaptation.
0765316994|4.0|Who would have thought that Star Trek plus metafiction would equal paydirt? (Well, maybe William Shatner, since one could argue he's been ubermeta for years...) Scalzi's novel is one long, beautifully-crafted in-joke, that succeeds because its heart is nothing but unironic love for the source material it so gleefully lampoons. I could have lived without the codas, which add nothing to the story whatsoever, but the first 231 pages are solid gold. Best read without beverages, as you risk snorting anything you're drinking out your nose any time someone mentions Borgovian Land worms or ice sharks.
B003JTHWPA|4.0|The thing about this book is that it's not afraid to make you feel a little depressed. The main characters all share one thing in common, and that's that they're not completely happy with how their lives are. The story of every character is well written, and consistent throughout the whole book. My only real complaint is that the ending is lacking a bit, but it leaves it up to you to imagine how their lives end up.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Narrated beautifully.  The mouse character is so cute and funny.  It's a family favorite.  Only 40 minutes long.  My sensitive son did think it was scary at first, but it turns out pretty tame in the end.  After watching it the first time, he loves it now.
0385349947|5.0|I've just finished Lean In, and as a women's career and leadership coach. Forbes Leadership contributor, and a former corporate Vice President, I can share that I have personally experienced each and every one of challenges that Sheryl describes in her book that are in the way of women's ascension to leadership.  The book touches on every facet of this complex dilemma, and chooses to focus on what women can do individually and personally to bring about the internal and external shifts required to create gender equity in leadership. While I can't relate to the level and degree of power and influence Sheryl wields (and most women I know and work with can't either), that doesn't detract from the power of the messages, and the keen insights and perspectives shared about how women (and men) can help themselves to: 1) gain clarity on what they really want in life and work, 2) understand how to assess their priorities and make aligned decisions that will fulfill and reward them over the long haul, 3) uncover and revise their own gender projections, biases and behaviors, 4) increase their awareness of how they can shift existing work cultures to be more diverse and inclusive, 5) claim more passion, power and purpose in their own lives and careers, and finally 6) take proactive steps to rectify the gross gender imbalance in leadership in all domains.<br /><br />RUN and read this book, and then take aligned action that will empower and enrich your goals and visions, and those of the work cultures you influence.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book was recommended to me by someone I respect. At first, I thought maybe I bought the wrong book, the first few pages were 'out there' for me. Notwithstanding, the rest of the book was very challenging. I highly recommend it.
B0012GMXBK|4.0|Metal Heart is one of the first Accept albums I heard. Beware, it isn't as heavy as Balls To The Wall or fast as Restless And Wild, but Metal Heart is a classic in its own right. The title track doesn't disappoint. Hoffman's solo is amazing on this one, still one of the most underrated guitarists in metal. \\"Midnight Mover\\" a shot at mainstream metal at the time. It is still a good track just doesn't pack the same punch as the previous track and the next one. \\"Up To The Limit\\" is energetic and just downright fun and catchy to listen to. The beat is great. \\"Wrong Is Right\\" catchy riff, Udo screaming! What isn't to love about this track!? \\"Screaming For A Love Bite\\" Honestly, I hate love songs, ballads, dumb chorus shouts about love and all, but I LOVE THIS TRACK! \\"Too High To Get It Right\\" A good heavy metal song. Nothing really technical or too impressive on this track. But the next track is beyond great. \\"Dogs On Leads\\" The highest moment on the album. Udo softly speaks his verses. Then BOOM!! Hoffman comes in. Kaufmann adds power with the drums! And the chorus is powerful. A great track and one of their best songs ever. \\"Teach Us To Survive\\" Reminds me of James Bond every time I hear the opening. I don't know what to make of the lyrics really. \\"Living For Tonight\\" Another shot at radio play, but honestly has some nice guitar work from Mr. Hoffman yet again. Udo's vocals sound as gritty as ever on this one. \\"Bound To Fail\\" Right from the start SOLO! A great track to close this classic heavy metal album.<br /><br />With Metal Heart, you might be Bound To Fail. But while you have some life left in you, Live For Tonight and crank this bad boy up!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just as good if not better than the movie. I think I liked the book more. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|I have a kindle fire (which u can check the wifi at the top by the settings tool bar). I wanted to see how it works so I downloaded it. But I tried to uninstall it but it wont work. Now it's taking up app memory. !!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is wonderful entertainment.  The characters do a wonderful job and keep you coming back for more!<br />Can't wait for the next episode.<br />I purchased video streaming for Season three and have no problems.  Recommend if you want true entertainment watch Downton Abbey!
B001AUKUTU|4.0|\\"Night People\\" Has energy, has a good solo, has Dio!! But it is missing something. Its a good track to start the album but not the highest moment on the album. \\"Dream Evil\\" Is heavy, and downright evil sounding. The lyrics are pretty creative but with this being Dio, I wouldn't expect anything different. \\"Sunset Superman\\" takes awhile to start up but once it does it becomes a mid-pace rocker that, in turn, becomes pretty heavy when it hits the breakdown. \\"All The Fools Sailed Away\\" beautiful ballad by one of the best vocalists in the history of metal. \\"Naked In The Rain\\" just like the first track on the album, it is good but doesn't have the same vibe as the last three tracks. \\"Overlove\\" The beginning sounds like something Ritchie Blackmore could have wrote. It is one of the most underrated songs on the album honestly. The chorus is powerful and it is a great song to sing along to when driving down back country roads in the dead of night with this bad boy cranked up loud. \\"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\\" A great track and another powerful ballad. Ronnie's voice is amazing on this one. So beautiful and powerful. The guitar work is incredibly catchy. \\"Faces In The Window\\" one of the fastest tracks on the album. But it suffers from repititon overdose. \\"When A Woman Cries\\" A good and catchy riff propels us to the end of the album. Overall, this song doesn't close out this album in a bang. Instead the flame starts to die after the track \\"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\\" This track also suffers from repition overdose as well.<br /><br />Overall, Ronnie James Dio had and still has great albums to his credit. Dream Evil could have ranked up there with Heaven And Hell and Holy Diver. It is an essential part of anyone's heavy metal collection without a doubt. One of his bests.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This was a great purchase. The package came in the specified time, it was in basically brand new quality for less than 2 dollars. About the only thing better than getting your product on time, in great quality and it being music by the Beatles is it being at an amazing price.
B008I3RARW|1.0|Noooooooo. I would not recommend this game.  Definitely would not pay $5 for it either!! Little kids would probably like it I don't. ( I'm not a little kid)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|app is very well made and incredibly realistic. I only wish the energy replenished sooner so I could play for longer periods of time.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I'm playing this on my kindle fire and the only thing that's annoying is the turning. I'll turn it but it turns wayy too far over. I still give it &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; stars though!!
B005HSL626|3.0|It's a pretty app, but the concept is not challenging or even attention-keeping for me. I keep it for my young grandchildren.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good solid flick.  I definitely enjoyed myself.  However, viewing this film just reminded me what a joke the academy is and how the oscars are just as bad as the \\"real\\" politics portrayed in this film.  If this is the best movie of 2012, then we as a nation have failed in the arts.
B008I3RARW|2.0|It is so basic that it is actually  funny. Definitely not worth $4.99. Like many have mentioned it has only one level, one track, and one car. It does feel like a demo. On the bright side you always win even if your car crashes against a wall, no IAP, no openfeint.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Whenever I get a new update all of my $money$ gets erased nd my high scores. It's like I'm restarting the game from the beginning. I still like to play it though for fun!! :-/

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Love them or hate them, The Eagles are a band that ran up a string of hits through the seventies that defined much of the decade. They've been accused of being narcissistic, overtly mellow, egotistical, and other things not all that complimentary. \\"The History Of The Eagles\\" spells all this out in detail, which makes it almost indispensable for fans of the bands or for folks who wonder how a seventies band made it though the music industry.<br /><br />While the band was centered around the songwriting axis of Glenn Frey and Don Henley, every band member, past and present, gets a say. It's a warts and all approach, often unflattering but frequently compelling. Managers, producers, album cover artists and fellow musicians (Bob Seger, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and more) get their say. The music drives the narrative, sticking closely to the evolution of tha band as they release their consecutive albums, up to the acrimonious split around 1980.<br /><br />However, the movie is broken into two parts, and the second half details the members as they seek separate careers and the reunion that takes place 14 years later. Again, the footage is not always flattering to the band (Don Felder gets so frustrated that he walks out of one of his segments), but the Eagles get, As Henley puts it, \\"that rarest of things in America, a second act.\\" This covers the period from \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" to the independently released \\"Long Road Out Of Eden.\\" The whole deal clocks in at 3hrs and 15 mins, making the documentary as exhaustive as can be.<br /><br />Loaded with plenty of vintage (those seventies haircuts!) and never before seen clips to add to the attitude of the movie. And as you watch these men, now elder statesmen of classic rock, make their case for the importance of the Eagles, you get the feeling that attitude (along with plenty of the big three, sex and drugs and rock and roll) fueled The Eagles through the run that continues to this day. Some will find it bloated and unwatchable, the rest of us, with memories of where the Eagles were in our lives, will find this invaluable.chable, the rest of us, with memories of where the Eagles were in our lives, will find this invaluable.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It's okay, but doesn't have some of the apps that I would expect, since they are within Facebook it self. I will probably delete it and try some of the other versions, but I might as well just attend face book from the internet on my galaxy pad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so fun to play its  addicting .it has a few glitches though but its my favorite game on my kindle.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a superb film - funny, thought provoking, a little sad and a simply wonderful cast, everything to love about a film.  I chose itbecause I admire Dames  Maggie Smith and Judy Dench and have enjoyed Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson in many other productions<br />I recommend this film to my friends and neighbors.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A great app for all your Android devices and computer. Keep track of everything in separate notebooks and read your notes on all your devices at any time. Takes some learning to discover how useful it is, but you'll be off and running quickly. Note: keep your downloads all from the Amazon Appstore (or the other one), but don't mix them!!! They don't play well together....
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Special effects are not interesting in and of themselves. This movie seemed to be made with the dictum, &#34;people love special effects!&#34;
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|this game is not fun.its not addicting its a little bit frustrating when you run out of coins though.dont get its a waste of time
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am soooo sick of hearing folks saying negative things about Hooper's decision to cast Russell Crowe.  This is a movie folks...very real, very raw, and extremely good.  If you want to see the troubled policeman's voice in opera style, go see the play.  Crowe's voice fit the part perfectly for this movie.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I found this movie to be very entertaining. I always like it when Adam Sandler does something and has to be censored because it is then funny without going into the gross zone. My kids ages 5 years old, 3 years old, and 18 months old all enjoyed the movie and stayed on the sofa with their 3D glasses on the whole time.
B00A3K2PZA|5.0|Brilliant! A+ in all departments. Outstanding cast. Matthew M proves once again, beyond any doubt, what a superb under-rated accomplished actor he really is. (He also proves, once again, that his is the best bod in films.) And Friedkin proves once again that he's one of the best director's we've got.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This movie was great.  When you have Amazone prime, it is free, join and get it for free.  The content is also good for kids
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book, by chance, only about a week after it was released.  My first impression involved my friend crying through the last hour of a bus ride as she finished - and this book made me sob, too.  After this, I went on to read other of John Green's books, but I still consider this one his best.<br /><br />This book has topped my list of favorite, well written books of all time, and this comes from someone who enjoys everything from teen romance to Tolkien's Silmarillion.  Well worth reading.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My kids stayed on the sofa with there 3D glasses on and watched the whole movie. They did this 3 days in a row. My kids are 5years old, 3years old, and 18 months old. They all enjoyed the movie and so did I. As an adult you will get more of the jokes and like seeing some of the old games one use to play throughout the movie and it has some good twists and turns in the plot. The kids seem to get a lot of the jokes and find it very visually enjoyable. A++
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am a 30 yr old mother of 4 and weakly have a blast taking turns with this game. I highly recommend to anyone at any age.

B00AQKEPMI|3.0|My kids would not sit through this movie at all. The movie has Okay 3D effects, but the movie as a whole seems more like a made for TV movie then an actual movie I would pay to see or own. I would wait for it to show on TV.
B004SBX112|5.0|This app is one of my best buys. Angry birds is a fun game to pass time. U should buy it if u can.

0307474259|5.0|Life saving although tough to read. For the non techie's read Primal Blueprint which relays much of this info but in simple terms. After reading PB, I then went on a mission to read a lot of these books and Taubes is one of the best at laying it all out. For those turned off by the tech stuff you shouldn't dismiss the way of life because of it.

B003PJ6UHA|4.0|this is an overview of some serious scientific theory, but simplified so that mere mortals can follow a line of thinking as to what makes us tick.
B0007PLLQ0|2.0|I was very disappointed when I played this movie.  I had searched and searched for the original theatrical release, the only one I had seen.  Everything I found was the director's cut only and the reviews were bad because people didnt want the director's cut, they wanted the version they knew.  When I found it here on Amazon it said it was both releases in one dvd.  I bought it because I thought I would enjoy comparing the two and i would still have the original version like I wanted.  There is no original version.  I watched them all, including the stupid version with the commentary but they are all the director's cut. If you are looking for the original version, this is not it, save your money and keep searching.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My girls love it and so do I!! Very upbeat and fun to listen to. We all sing along to this!

B007REV4YI|5.0|When they found Daniel Craig for the newer Bond, they hit the jackpot.  This action adventure at times, is believable.  You just got to love his character.  Although I love Sean Connery, Daniel Craig is the best replacement for Sean.  Forget about the others, they were way to wimpy.  This movie never departs from the story, it has action, some sex, but a good story line.  You just got to love it!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Truly an addicting game. I couldn't stop playing it until I finished all ten waves. I am playing part two now.

Not the old hard rock by any means, but some of us, incluidng Bon Jovi have grown up.  I beleive with<br />this album he showa a great maturity and I love the songs.  All of them.  Totally great album, I give it stars all the way.  Not one of these songs I do not like.  Keep em coming!

B0063M22QO|4.0|Lots of fun!  The tiles are pretty; easy on the eyes.  Format is excellent. The games don't take a lot of time to play.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|It was very interesting but got a little monotonous in the second half. I kept hoping for more to happen.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|Ive stated before that if people will look at this more as \\"Wicked\\" compared to \\"Wizard of Oz\\" they would enjoy it much more. It doesnt tie in perfectly at all with POTO but its still a good play. Personally I think the Australian version is better overall but the OLC soundtrack has some great moments as well. While the Phantom and Christine are both too soft in this version, Ramin and Sierra both have amazing voices. Their solos are really incredible. They may not get the full emotion accross in their songs all the time but its still very pretty to listen to. The music is amazing and while the story is butchered and almost laughable its still beautiful music. But do yourself a favor before you buy it: listen to the recording and watch the Australian version to see if you can live with the changes. Both have their own magic.<br /><br />On the other hand if you are just a Ramin and Sierra fangirl then nothing else will matter to you other than knowing these two are singing the main roles. But if you are looking for a broader spectrum of a better cast overall and better storyline then you should really check out the Australian version. I have both but I prefer the Australian.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Was surprised with this book. I have never read a Colleen Hoover book and this one was really good. Sexual content well done and what a surprise ending. Loved it!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great if you're into match 3 games that have special items i.e. block with one or two chains across them, which I DO happen to love. Not as good as some games I've played but pretty danged close!<br /><br />Starts out with this tree village that has been destroyed by this demon and several centuries later someone comes along to destroy the demon. Now you have been hired to rebuild the village back or maybe even better.<br /><br />If you like those kinds of match 3 games then you'll really have fun. There's a couple more surprises in the game but decided you need something for a
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|The title above is enough for me (RATM), but this story just rocks, excuse the pun.  I have not seen the bonus tracks yet, just the main story of the history of Sound City.  Since I can relate to almost all the artists expect Barry Manalo or hair bands.  I am thrilled that David made this movie/documentary, shed a few tears along the way,,, job well done and if you have loved music especially rock (I go back to Motown and that is a long time ago), buy it  !
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I love this play. It has amazingly haunting music and the Australian sets are very stunning. Anna Obyrne and Ben Lewis are truly amazing both at singing and acting. In fact the entire cast is truly very gifted and talented. I myself love it. I long for the day I can see it live.<br /><br />That being said its really not for everyone. The story is very far-fetched and forced. Fortunetly its not quite as ridiculous as the London version was. The major problems in that performance were addressed and noticeable changes were made to fill in gaps and make both the story and the characters much more likeable. Its a bandaid when it probably needed stitches, but it works.<br /><br />If you can look at this peice as not meaning to be a logical in-character developmental story that continues where the original left off and accept it for what it is and laugh at the stuff that doesnt make sense without getting worked up, you will enjoy it. If you are stuck on certain characters would never do this or dates not matching up or unable to let go of your personal ship, then you will not like it.<br /><br />The music is truly amazing and the costumes and sets are incredible. While the story may not make a whole lot of sense, its still a great play. Anyone who can go in with an open mind should have no problem finding something to enjoy about it.<br /><br />Just think of this as an \\"adaptation\\" and not really a \\"sequel\\". To me its like trying to tie \\"Wicked\\" in with \\"Wizard Of Oz\\". There are major plot holes but they are both great musicals even if they dont tie in together perfectly. You look at them as 2 different musicals and 2 different stories even though they have essentially the same characters. And honestly thats how you have to look at \\"Love Never Dies\\" too. If you can do that then you will enjoy this.

B000Y5JFNE|5.0|In the dungeons of the castle of the evil Queen-sorceress Bavmorda, a prisoner gives birth to a child who, according to an ancient prophecy, will put an end to the reign of the Queen. A midwife saves the child from the wrath of Bavmorda, but is forced to throw her cradle in a river when reached by the Hounds of the Queen.<br /><br />The river brings the child near a village of \\"Nelwyns\\" (dwarfs like beings), where little Willow finds and adopts her. When the Queen's Hounds find and attack their village, Willow consults the village council and Wizard High Aldwin. The wizard charges Willow with the task of returning the baby to her \\"own kind.\\"  He is to give the baby girl to the first responsible human, and then return to his family and their quiet life of farming.<br /><br />Willow goals change as he journeys.  Learning the baby's true identity as that of  \\"Elora Danan\\" - the baby girl destined to bring about the downfall of the evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda, Willow takes it upon himself to protect Elora from Queen Bavmorda, who would kill the child to prevent it from fulfilling its destiny.<br /><br />Willow is joined by an increasing number of allies: swordsman Madmartigan, Sorceress Fin Razel, and the Brownies Franjean & Rool.  Willow and his allies are pursued by Queen Bavmorda's daughter, Sorsha, and the evil commander of Queen Bavmorda's army, General Kael, whom are searching for Elora and bring her back to Queen Bavmorda's castle, where Queen Bavmorda bids to kill Elora in a ritual and prevent the prophecy of her downfall.<br /><br />So, from what was at first a simple journey, this small band of characters cannot just go back, the only return is to go forward.  Evil has set events in motion, and now they must overcome the forces of darkness in the ultimate battle of good versus evil!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book kept my attention.  Initially, it takes you back to being a high school student and the different pros and cons inclusive of having a crush and not knowing how to handle it.  But the discovered puppy love quickly alters as the course of the story continues.  I would recommend this book.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The technical apsect of this story was well researched, however I found the overall depth of the story to be rather superficial. The characters could have been fleshed out a little more.<br />As a whole I did rather enjoy this book and would happily recommend it to anyone seeking some light science fiction reading.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I am a huge fan of the first three books in this series but GRRM is clearly under pressure to lengthen the series now that it is so popular. It's become a wending, pointless story. It's exciting in the first book when Martin kills off the character we think is the hero 2/3 of the way through. It's just disappointing in the fifth book when he kills off a character he introduced in the fifth book that we could not possibly care any less about.  And we really begin to lose our interest in the main characters at this point. One of the more important characters in the oak get stabbed near the end and I have no desire to find out if he lives or dies.  I MAY borrow the next book from the library and read it if I have nothing better to do but I won't be buying any more of them. GRRM has enough $ now and the love is gone.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is, of course, the basis for the hit movie by the same name in which Jennifer Lawrence won an Academy Award.  A review I read said the movie was better than the book, so I almost did not read it. Did anyway, and still have not seen the movie, but the book is terrific. The plot is centered around a mentally disturbed young man, Pat Peoples, an ex-high school coach, who found himself just released from a mental health facility to his mother's care, with no memory of why he was committed, but with an all consuming love for and passion to see again his estranged wife, Nikki, who had a restraining order against him. Pat is usually a gentle, somewhat naïve person, who believe in and prays to God, but who can snap into a deadly rage if he does not take his meds - especially if he hears sounds from Kenny G's sax (the reason for this comes out when he finally remembers his past).  He is trying, with the help of his therapist (an Indian Philadelphia Eagles fan) to become a kinder more caring and extremely physically fit person,  so his wife will take him back, and he prays repeatedly for this to happen.  The author develops Pat's character through his relationships, sometimes funny-sometimes sad, with his caring mother, his father (who cares about no one and nothing except the Eagles - and beer), his brother (married, successful, and also a fanatical fan), his black buddy from the mental care facility (an ex-rapper), his therapist and group of Indian Eagles fan friends (who travel to the games together in a big green bus, and start tailgating 7 or 8 hours before each home game),  and his best friend from High School,  Ronnie,- whose wife's sister, Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), a beautiful but weird acting young widow, is also just out of mental care.  How Tiffany is connected to the series of heart breaking letters between Pat and Nikki, and how Pat finds out what had happened to both him and to Tiffany is a bit of skillful writing that brings a tear, and also brings not the silver lining Pat had been praying for, but a different one that the reader is convinced will be better after all.also brings not the silver lining Pat had been praying for, but a different one that the reader is convinced will be better after all.

1932907009|5.0|For budding writers and movie makers, this book provides an excellent summary of the script writing/plotting process.  One of the most difficult aspects of developing a story is how to resolve conflict in a plausible way.  Snyder shows the mechanics of how this works through humorous vignettes.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews, I realize that \\"Save the Cat\\" seems to be a controversial book, if only for the inflated advertisement of being \\"the last book you'll ever need in screenwriting.\\"  All writers, including screenwriters, must know that no book can teach the art of writing.  Writing comes from patient and sensitive observation, the willingness to observe real people and real dialogue, the obsessive studying of great movies and books to understand plot, conflict, character development, satisfactory resolution.  However, the beginning writer is often overwhelmed by the expansive blank slate.  \\"Save the Cat\\" if a little buoy in the sea of words.  It gives a useful framework to start thinking about all of these elements.<br /><br />Adherence to Snyder's advice is probably not going to result in a good script unless there is talent and originality.  Screenwriting isn't baking a cake, and it's not even brain surgery.  You can't watch someone do it and just copy it.  But it isn't impossible either.  You cannot know how to break rules unless you know what the rules are.  It is very useful to start with a pitch, as Snyder suggests.  The pitch is the nucleus around which you can structure your ideas.  An amorphous and artsy idea is great only if you are Terence Malick.<br /><br />Besides, reading the book takes ~2 hours, about the time it takes to watch a longish Hollywood movie.  After reading this book, I was able to watch movies in a much more educated way, understanding the concept of the character arc, the 15 beats that Snyder present (yes, they are almost always there), the endings.  The companion book, \\"Save the Cat Goes to the Movies\\" explores these concepts in more detail, with various well-known genre movies including Alien and The Shining, and I would also highly recommend it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Very good game. Just wish more things were available for the coins earned in game instead of bucks......  still good fun.
B000L212HW|5.0|Love this movie. Can watch it over and over. Never get tried of it. Matthew McConaughey is a real dragon killer. :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Definitely want to continue with this series. Engaging plot and good characters that were easy to bond with. Ending was a cliff hanger but to be expected.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is so much fun. I have had no problems with it and as for spending money, yes you have to spend a little but all I spent was three dollars and that's all I needed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Well done season, with twists and turns. Can't wait for the next season to begin.<br />Special features are a great added bonus.
B004XQO90E|5.0|******<br />Please rate this review if you find it helpful<br />******<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie.  Not only is it visually appealing, but the story line is also we interesting. &#34;Source Code&#34; is an ingenious thriller that comes billed as science fiction, although its science is preposterous.  Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal relives this train ride over and over again but each time tries to figure out why the train blew up and who did it.  It's a very interesting story.<br /><br />As for the quality, this film has impressive color and sound however the sound is far better than the picture.  Hearing distant voices on the train makes you feel like you're really on the train.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great movie to give as a gift because it has something for both males and females.  I highly recommend this film.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I like to see modern day London which is often shown in various episodes, actors are excellent. Third season has started filming.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|After seeing the movie, I knew I liked the general concept of Reacher's character.  I like the additional aspects of him provided by the book.  I'm going to head straight into book #2!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|One of the best. Engaging characters, humorous undertones and a script that flows naturally from scene to scene while the suspense builds. Grace Kelly shines almost every moment onscreen, Cary Grant is suave as hell- even while wearing an ascot. The scenery should be credited as a co-star...
B0036BK6MW|5.0|***<br />Please rate this review if you find it helpful<br />***<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie that should be in everyone's collection.  It's a sad tale about a man who is taken in by a loving family.  This movie is one that you will never forget and you can always curl up with someone special and really appreciate what both of you have.  This is a must own film!

B004UPAIDK|5.0|Crazy,creepy, & halarious to watch. I've never laughed so hard at a horror flick. Full of nice little cliches and probably made a lot of them.
B007JUWTI0|3.0|Oh, I had such high hopes for this film. I mean, it has Percy, Legolas, and Mr. Darcy in it. It should have been fantastic by all rights.<br /> This film was a real disappointment though. I think it is a clear case of just trying to hard. It was like the Musketeers meet Captain Sky. It was simply too much, and all the wannabe pomp and circumstance really took away from the legendary story line.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|We are quite happy to have this movie and were very excited when it came in the mail. We got a great deal on it and it was in great condition.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|I'm a sci-fi fan, so I was aware of the movie before it was released due to the web buzz. Considering it was made for around 10 million dollars, the VFX were REALLY GREAT. I've seen that the VFX team has won some awards, and not surprised. There are some continuity issues, but is a fun film.

0316223239|5.0|*spoilers inside*<br /><br />This remarkable novel was inspired by Josef Fritzl's incarceration of his daughter Elisabeth, however, we get to look at two people's imprisonment from a very unusual perspective. This book is not about agony, pain and despair of being trapped, it is about the bond that keeps Jack and his Ma safe and sane for years. This book is about a parent's love for their child, it is about surviving and discovering a brand new world.<br /><br />We learn about Room (their 12ft-by-12ft domain) through Jack's eyes. He is a typical 5 years old boy who loves his five books, his few toys and crayons, and whose favourite past times are watching TV and playing with his Ma. There is only one thing that makes him different: he has never been outside Room.<br /><br />The novel makes us explore very different Inside and Outside, compare the very unlike worlds of Jack and his Ma. We hear Jack's voice behind every word we read. We can only see what Jack sees and we can only feel what Jack feels, and throughout the first part of the novel we get to enjoy Jack's life with him and do \\"thousands of things\\" he gets to do every day. His language is coherent and clear and his thoughts are imaginative and naïve. Jack introduces us to every object that he is in contact with every day. For him they are his friends, for us they become characters called Plant, Rug, Sink, Skylight and Remote.<br /><br />For Jack life is perfect. He is healthy and happy and Room is full of warmth, fun and undivided attention of his Ma. Jack's Ma, though trapped in the same space, finds herself in a very different world. She is a victim of a man we call Old Nick, who has detained her for seven years, who pays Room a visit every night to deliver food, take out the trash and rape her. He also is Jack's father.<br /><br />The novel reaches its dramatic turning point when Jack and his Ma are freed. They suddenly find themselves having to learn to survive outside Room. They both struggle to get used to the Outer Space Jack assumed only existed on TV, having to star in it himself. Together with Jack, we are now facing a dilemma: is having one lollipop as a very special treat better than choosing from a jar of different flavours every day? Locked in a hospital, away from people and germs, hiding from paparazzi and relatives advising to get on with their lives we almost sympathise with their recurring craving of returning back to Room.<br />Emma Donoghue's Room is the kind of book you want to free up your day for. It is as if you become a part of it from the very first page and it ends leaving you with endless questions. If you were Ma, what would you miss the most from the outside world? What would you ask for a `Sundaytreat' if you were Jack? How will Jack cope when he starts school? This is one of the most moving novels I've read in months. Room has been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2010 and has had been awarded the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize amongst other awards.ed to the Outer Space Jack assumed only existed on TV, having to star in it himself.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I knew this was an adult movie and that there was going to be a certain amount of stupidity involved, but I thought, &#34;Hey, I'll take a chance. I could use a good laugh session&#34;.  I don't think I lasted 10 minutes before I turned it off. This movie is pure raunch and filth. I was highly disappointed, especially that Mark Wahlberg participated in this trash. It was a total waste of time and rental fees.
0061537969|3.0|The book will grab your attention at the beginning. Reading a dog's point of view is certainly entertaining, though hardly credible - those more skeptical of you just let it go. I especially like the massacre of the possessed zebra - had to laugh out loud while in public transport.<br /><br />The story moves fast and does make you feel for the main character, who is not too perfect, but is genuinely good, just like most people out there. And though you know that there should be a happy ending, the book keeps you wondering.<br /><br />I gave the book only 3 stars because of its ending. Having accepted the dog's thinking process, I was about to enjoy the culmination, when the author spoils the whole thing by making the dog speak. Oh, no. Why? Pushed it too far.<br /><br />This is a book for someone who has some spare time on their hands or is selecting their travel reading list. A good present for a dog lover.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I downloaded this app last night and it worked fine. I tried to open it today to finish my puzzle and it said it had stopped working. I lost the puzzle I was working on-no big deal. I tried starting a new one and it wouldn't open. Guess I'll be looking for a new puzzle app.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is not the typical 007 who can be a superman.  The movie shows how he has to struggle against all odds and sometimes fails.  It seems to be more like real situations faced by many of our special forces men and women.
B00BLDD3A4|5.0|This is a great soundtrack. It almost feels like a follow up to Probot except not so heavy.  Really great work!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|So worth the money. I have wanted this CD for years, but was never able to find it in a store for a reasonable price and they if I did find it, it was used or super expensive. I searched for such a long time, and finally found the CD, new for a good price. I listen to it just about everyday! So obsessed!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers!!!!! It is hard but awesome. I have a pretty big high score. But be careful about the trains because you'll die or be caught. But you don't want to be caught because then you restart.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|You'll need a little patience with this one.  But, once you're in it,  you won't be able to put it down.  Grant it, I'm a little biased when it comes to historical fictions, however, the story and the way it was written is inspiring and educational in so many different layers.  Clavell made me feel as if he transported me into a different time and place and captured every detail.  A true classic.
B003VW54QO|5.0|One of my husband's favorite movies.  he is an avid John Wayne fan.  I would recommend to any western or John Wayne fan.

B009RRIP86|1.0|I owned a CM Storm Trooper for a few months until I saw this thing earlier in the week and decided to purchase it.<br /><br />First, the quality is very cheap. The only solid thing on the entire unit is the motherboard tray and the mounting screws. The case's swing cover hangs crooked when propped up with the little arm. The Hot Swap and Optical Drive Bay housing units are made from the cheapest alloys, riveted and not welded (and poorly I should add) and worst of all there is only one mounting rod to support water cooling? Seriously? And it's made from the same cheap alloys as the case. I have a Corsair H100 unit, and they way the case was designed, if it hung from the bar it would block access to any peripherals that require cables!!!!! This I had to mount it sunny side up and it sways as a result. Terrible design flaw.<br /><br />Now even with all that, I love the aesthetic of the case. But my case's hot swap drive sata receiver card (factory mounted behind the 3 removable bays) came with 2 of the 3 sata cable inputs broken off inside! Additionally, the Optical drive housing that slides on, the plastic part underneath that holds the optical drive bay housing in place came with the two screw holding it in flopping around loose because they weren't size matched to their respective points of entry. The plastic piece itself was cheap and flimsy and I later noticed one of the tabs that were meant to hold it in (but didn't work anyway) broken off completely.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome they should make a subways sitters Japan or Tokyo because they have the worlds fastest trains

B008I3RARW|1.0|Turning is very unresponsive. No up grades. No other cars. Horrible AIs. Broken throttle. Instant brakes, so no slowing down. Who ever spent 5 bucks on this should be very angry.
1401322786|4.0|I am still not sure what I am feeling from finishing this novel.  I was confused then I kept reading.  The story of father time will make you think.  Can we stop time or is time to long.  I guess the lesson is don't wish time away or try to slow it down.  Life is what it is and it is up to us what we do with our time here on Earth! Not my favorite of Mr. Albom but like all of his books you will continue to think about it after you read the last page.  More a 3 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't have that option.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Did not agree with how modern women are painted as insecure, self doubters.  I believe men have similar thoughts, so we are all just being human, really, not female when we feel like a big fraud.<br /><br />Sheryl Sandberg's book is an interesting diatribe at times, with good citations of studies, but it is not a revelation.<br /><br />Perhaps I should write a book about my average modern woman career and see if I can earn some extra cash flow, too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great read. The book was exciting at times and sad. This book had me on the edge of my seat
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read. Can't wait to start the next one in the series. I would<br /> highly recommend this book to anyone
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Originally I saw the movie in 3D at the theater and like everyone else was blown away by the new technology and the story, so when I the saw the movie again after a few years, I was not disappointed, the home theater 3D experience was almost as woowing and my whole 3D glasses family, enjoyed it as well. James Cameron is not only innovative and a creative director, but a great storyteller as well. Arguably the best movie in a decade.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|A sassy, saucy movie about the choices  women make in their lives and why we make them.  It is the first Woody Allen movie that I have watched and it made me want to watch some of his others because I had  assumed I wasn't a fan of his movies based on snippets of other movies I'd seen in the past.  As an arm chair traveller (and real traveller every chance I get), the  cinematography is spectacular and makes it seem as if you're right there with them.  You can definitely tell that Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem fell in love on the set of the movie, which of course makes the story all the more believable although it is definitely not meant to be that.  Javier Bardem's character is fantastic from the moment he tries to pick up on the two of them at the restaurant, , as is Penelope Cruz' passionate crazy woman portrayal.  I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it's my &#34;go to&#34; movie when I need a good laugh.

B00005214X|5.0|The very best George Harrison album, hands down. Originally a three record set, George's first solo album to contain real songs includes many songs that were leftovers from his years as a Beatle. The only thing about this album that takes away from the music is the horrid Phil Spector Wall Of Muffled Sound production. This would be a great album to re-release without the overblown Phil Spector production.<br /><br />But assuming an \\"All Things Must Pass...Naked\\" album probably won't see the light of day, we're still left with a gem of an album. Every song is a beautiful statement that only GH could deliver in such a sincere way.

Before hearing this I had little appreciation for classical music, but ELP combined so many musical styles, including classical, that I just had to explore further.<br /><br />\\"Trilogy\\" might be my favorite ELP album simply because it was my first, but not a moment is wasted here. Every note from the beginning to the end is important and urgent.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the deluxe edition is coming out soon...

B005LAIIJY|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0<br /><br /> With clever aplomb, Quentin Tarantino has turned the Spaghetti Western on its head and created a vision of the pre-Civil War South and Wild West, much more like it probably was: a landscape replete with the nightmare images of slavery, highlighting a society permeated by racism at every turn. When he decides to be 'serious', Tarantino 'gets it' and proffers up a series of disturbing images, scenes and characters that prove on a certain level, he's read his history.<br /><br />The opening scene, where a group of male slaves in chains are being transported by the Speck Brothers, introduces us to the brutal world of slavery. One notes the horrible condition these men are in and the sadistic way they're treated by the racist Ace and Dicky Speck. The brutal way in which the slaves take revenge on Dicky, after his horse falls on him after being shot, suggests their actions are an understandable reaction to years of terrible oppression.<br /><br />Tarantino is hardly finished. There are scenes of slaves on the way to the slave market in shackles, often forced to wear gruesome metal head locks that resemble the kind of restraints one associates with Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs'; a terrifying mob of hooded racist night riders, obvious precursors of the Ku Klux Klan, on their way to take revenge on Tarantino's protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django; Mandingo fighting where blacks are forced to basically kill one another in the wrestling ring while racist whites bet on the fight for sport; and the copious use of the 'n-word' throughout the film (Tarantino doesn't care about offending modern day sensibilities--he realizes that the overuse of that demeaning word, was commonplace during those times!).<br /><br />Tarantino is at his best when he comes up with a character like Calvin J. Candie, the racist plantation owner, so winningly played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Candie is not just your average racist brute as are so many of the other characters in the film. Candie represents a racist with intelligence, as he toys with those he lords over, sadistically deriving pleasure through both physical and psychological means. In perhaps the most disturbing scene in the film, he coaxes one of his top Mandingo fighters down from a tree, after the poor, broken man confesses he's no longer able to fight and then sics a pack of savage dogs on him, tearing the man to pieces. Candie also is shown to have much in common with the Nazis in the 20th century, as he pontificates about what he believes to be the genetic inferiority of the black man.<br /><br />After all this clever scene setting as well as some brilliant writing in his portrait of Candie, why does Tarantino undermine his story by resorting to the same kind of puerile wish fulfillment fantasy, we saw in full relief in his previous effort, 'Inglorious Basterds'? The answer can be found in the examination of Tarantino's two protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django.<br /><br />While Christoph Waltz proves to be highly entertaining as Dr. King Schultz, the witty dentist turned bounty hunter, one must recognize that Schultz, personifies Tarantino himself. Not only does Tarantino want to be on the winning side, but he must prove, as a white Italian, that he is entirely sympathetic to black people and is 100% against racism. So here he grafts this 21st century sensibility on to his Schultz character, who is such a friend of black people, that he'll not only make Django his partner but go out of his way and risk his life, to help Django save his wife from the clutches of the very dangerous Calvin J. Candie.<br /><br />It hardly seems believable that Schulz would be able to save himself in that scene where he appeals to the Marshal's good will. I would imagine that after shooting the sheriff, the Marshal and his posse wouldn't have been in the mood to listen to Schultz's story that he was a bounty hunter, and wouldhave shot them both on the spot. I was unable, however, to suspend my disbelief when it came to Schultz making Django his assistant, and parading around, ensuring all those racist townspeople got their comeuppance. It might have made Tarantino feel good that his white liberal Schultz and super-human racist killer, Django, were so successful, but the reality of the 1858 South, was quite different (Think about John Brown's fate after attempting to start a slave revolt when he raided Harper's Ferry).<br /><br />If Schultz is a stand-in for today's white liberal, Django represents the flip side: militant black people's wish fulfillment. Spike Lee is completely right that 'Django' trivializes the history of slavery (I wish only he saw the film so he can back up his beliefs with specific detail). When Django kills Candie's sister and Samuel L. Jackson's Uncle Tom, Stephen, and then blows up the plantation, it gives those unfamiliar with American history the wrong impression. Quite the opposite occurred: there was little opportunity for blacks to revolt against the slave master; and when such revolts did occur, they were brutally suppressed.<br /><br />By indulging himself with these revenge fantasies, Tarantino may be encouraging ignorant young people to resort to violence.

I was unable, however, to suspend my disbelief when it came to Schultz making Django his assistant, and parading around, ensuring all those racist townspeople got their comeuppance. It might have made Tarantino feel good that his white liberal Schultz and super-human racist killer, Django, were so successful, but the reality of the 1858 South, was quite different (Think about John Brown's fate after attempting to start a slave revolt when he raided Harper's Ferry).<br /><br />If Schultz is a stand-in for today's white liberal, Django represents the flip side: militant black people's wish fulfillment. Spike Lee is completely right that 'Django' trivializes the history of slavery (I wish only he saw the film so he can back up his beliefs with specific detail). When Django kills Candie's sister and Samuel L. Jackson's Uncle Tom, Stephen, and then blows up the plantation, it gives those unfamiliar with American history the wrong impression. Quite the opposite occurred: there was little opportunity for blacks to revolt against the slave master; and when such revolts did occur, they were brutally suppressed.<br /><br />By indulging himself with these revenge fantasies, Tarantino may be encouraging ignorant young people to resort to violence.

B003YFJ5U4|4.0|Very well presented! A riveting history of physics through the eyes of giants. Best book I've read on the subject since \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\" by Richard Rhodes.
B000UZNRS2|3.0|I found this book a little disjointed compared to most of David Baldacci's other work. I still enjoyed the story, but it was not as tightly crafted as the others.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone. It is clean and very well written. Historical without being to complex. Good for families and people tired of all the cussing and vulgar movie series out there. Goes to show you that a good movie can be made without all the foul words and actions. All around good.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|When I first got the game it was fun and addictive but that only lasted a week.  Some games were too easy while others were too hard, there was no middle ground. Cannot complain too much. it was free.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I read this book at the urging of several friends touting it as &#34;The Best Book Ever.&#34;  I won't go that far, but it does have plenty to offer. An engaging hero, a cagy love interest, action, comedy, tragedy. It is well written and believable. Bottom line: You will not regret this purchase.
B0000024YL|5.0|Just as I remembered, from all those years ago.  The songs hold just as true today as they did back then.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It is a great love story! Catching fire will be a really good book!!!!! Bye
B001B3TCYA|4.0|Since this was a requested gift so I can say little about the quality only that is came on time.

B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It was a great book I loved it more than anything in the entire world of doing this for reading this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Honestly I really enjoyed it I'm a younger reader, but also a mature reader and that's exactly who I would recommend this book to... mature readers<br />It has some graphic parts and negative influences, by in reality it's no more inappropriate than High School/Jr. High<br />I really loved this book because while reading it I experienced that happy sad Charlie talks about, because of how raw it was when it came to human emotions<br />Definitely a good read!!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|sounds like fun, works fine and you're playing against others on line.  It is a good fast game to play.
B000FBFML6|5.0|I would recommend The Tawny Man series to anybody who loves fantasy novels and is disappointed by many of the books on the market today.  I was instantly enchanted and transported into this world.
B00005JM02|1.0|Granted the price was right. But I got to watch a quarter of this movie with my kid and from that point on it skips and either disc is so scratched that they won't even play.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|You will not be disappointed in Robin Hobb's character development.  If you love Guy Gavriel Kay, Robert Jordan, and the other giants of fantasy, you will love the Farseer books.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|If the game wouldn't freeze up we would give it a better rating.  I am sure if we had a chance to play it more then we would give it 5 stars because from what we have had a chance to play was really exciting and fun.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|Please read The Tawny Man books if you are disappointed with many of the other books available on the market today! You will not be disappointed!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute love story with likable characters.  Kept me entertained and read in one setting. An added plus was the book was free.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Sometimes it is hard for me to get into fantasy books because I hold them all up to The Wheel of Time and Guy Gavriel Kay's books, and many are found lacking.  NOT THIS BOOK!  It is an awesome read that I didn't want to put down.  I immediately bought book 2, and I'm totally bummed because he hasn't finished writing book 3 yet!  Try it, you'll like it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So far I have really enjoyed reading everything I've purchased by Nicholas Sparks.  I fully intend to see this movie Sunday!
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|The Tawny Man Trilogy books are absolutely enchanting! Do yourself a favor--if you love fantasy, don't let these books pass you by!
B0051ERJBI|3.0|When you mix in Brazilian legends with an English power house, you get EVEN MORE BRUTALITY! I miss Peter Tagtaren's voice like in the first album. I AM enjoying the newer approach to the riffs. LEgendary guitarist for Brazil's Pentagram is shredding this one.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Loved the movie!!! The tie in to the series was very well done- the phrases & other tie in's so fun!! cannot wait for the sequel!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it !!! It's so many board that you can go to and create , then pin your own board to whatever category<br />You are looking at. I go on interest and l be on it for hours. I love the food board, wedding, home decor,<br />Health .l just love them all!!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Wonderful book. Recommend to any history buff. I fell in love with this book, it is so well written and easy to read.
0756407125|5.0|not only is this a cant put down its a cant wait for the next part. it arrived with in a week and in perfect condition
B001HN6940|5.0|The richest computer work and animation I have ever seen, and the costumes and acting and music... There are so many subtle things to see that you must watch it several times just to catch everything.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|When Tom Cruise was given the role of Jack Reacher by Child himself many fans flipped the frying pan complaining that his height, build, etc was entirely wrong for the character and, I get that. However similar to a movie called \\"Thor\\" (2011) you can't just cast someone with muscle, blonde hair, etc and say that is doing the material justice. The same goes with Jack Reacher sure Tom isn't even 6 feet tall but,can he act? You better believe he can and not only can he act, he always delivers his characters story even if some of his films aren't that great. So now that you know where I stand (I feel Cruise was miscast but I to would have cast him because well I'd rather see talent behind an important character then have someone just for show). To the review the film in short, well directed, beautifully acted, with a smart screen play from a beloved novel. Do yourself a favor, watch this! Forget the anti-Cruise fanboys.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The visually lush settings, splendid cinematography (the scene on Calvary Hill is luminous with stars, the battles scene with the horsemen is stirring and terrifying) the production is a treat for eyes, ears, and mind. Truly underappreciated greatness.
B00BN2CY7G|5.0|This album is good from start to finish.  If you like Bon-Jovi, you will love this album.  Definitely worth the money.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I never imagined Shakespeare done this way. The acting is marvelous, and the setting is a delight. I've watched it over and over and still see things I missed. Amazing! The elevator scene alone is worth the price.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My kids use in there room so they do not be late for school and asp does my 2 year old .
B0067R0APK|5.0|One quick glance and one quick scroll with my forefinger and Ive got the info to make a decision to ride my motorcycle or not.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|Entertaining action scenes and voice acting, good for kids, but there's not much to the story, can be quite predictable and undeveloped.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thought it was a good book. Right up until the end. I found the ending to be not believable. It was a little cheesy, but you should kinda expect that.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Awesome movie, great adventure. Stays true to the book and adding some new content that tie to the Lord of the Rings.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Amazon did an okay job on the backpack...So let's look @ the good features...<br />**Good**<br />1: It's discreet - Nearly all black, except for the zippers (Amazon logo)...which makes this perfect to hide our expensive toys inside...<br />2: Decent Space - Although short, my Canon 5D Mark III and all of my other accessories fit just right...<br />3: Light Weight - After using the Tamrac 5374...This backpack feels extremely light, even when fully loaded...<br />4: Padded Shoulder Straps - These are nicely padded...it feels light marshmallows on my shoulders...But Please fix the stitching!<br />**Not So Good**<br />It's hard to give this 3 stars because it really is a neat backpack...However, I do have a concern with the quality...It feels really cheap...it is only $35, no mystery there...I feel if I add anymore weight to this BP, that the straps will tear...We will see how it holds up...Although I have a decent camera in there...I can't feel 100% safe just yet...The interior padding falls short...Unless you double up on the padding I can't how this will protect against rough usage...I am very careful with everything, especially my cameras...so there is some good and bad in that part...but if you come from using a Tamrac you'll understand...The top handle of-course has terrible stitching...plus its position has an unnatural feeling...the placement makes it feel front heavy...I would recommend adding additional padding on the handle, not only to make it easier on the hand but maybe that might help balance the BP...once the position is corrected of course...Maybe Amazon could make a premium version sometime in the future...For now, this BP will do...I will be doing some more field testing, see what other issues come up...Good effort Amazon!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Too many main characters have died. Love the show, but if Julian Fellows wants the show to fizzle out he's certainly on the right track.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I started out reading this slowly until I got to the part where her husband realized her new identity.  Then, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  It is well written, filled with suspense, and has surprising revelations at the end.  I am excited now to see the movie.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|this is not google!  it is a trick! now i need to figure out how to remove it.  dammit. i dislike this android crap.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This the best app I could have ever gotten. This work great with my kindle fire he. I recommend this app to everyone
0802473156|4.0|Very insightful and accurate. Enjoyable, easy read. Allows you to get to know yourself amd your partner better. Would recommend this book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors and one of the best in today's mystery market. I can't get enough of his books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There are a lot of action and surprises. I was disappointed that T-Bone and Travis left the shows.I cannot wait for season 4 to start.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck did a great job directing, producing, and acting in this film. Would see this film again. Super, super.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The graphics and storyline were good.  The hidden objects areas were sometimes a little dark making it hard to spot some items without using hints.  All in all a good game.
B0001I561E|5.0|No doubt it, Aladdin is one of my favorite Disney films ever made, I owned it VHS as a kid, and I'm proud to say it was about time to get on DVD, thank you, Amazon for your help.
B003Q6D282|5.0|I enjoyed the series even though I wish they would have extended it out one more movie instead of rushing 2 movies into 1 with Saw The Final Chapter.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It brought back so many memories of growing up in a Catholic environment as well as going to Catholic school.  It was also pretty heavy considering the topic which is one that is on the minds of alot of people these days.  All in all I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone/
B000LPR9ZS|5.0|What can I say it's Saw II. I enjoyed the series even though I wish they would have extended it out one more movie instead of rushing 2 movies into 1 with Saw The Final Chapter.
B008I3RARW|2.0|I wouldn't pay for this. 1track, 3 play modes. Doesn't keep stats. easy to beat timer and opponents. Tilt device is best control mode for steering and speed. Steering in other modes awkward. other throttles ok. Deleted!
B000EWBKLC|5.0|The Original movie that started it all. I do think this series was getting played out but I still enjoyed it and wish they would have made just one more instead of rushing to put two scripts into one and making Saw The Final Chapter.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Ziggy gets Jiggy with his Wiggy minus the Piggy. The Zigmeister is back from the dead, although missing his original space crew, the album more than satisfies yearnings for modern and retro Bowie.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|We watched this as a family.  The film is very well done and it is hard to believe this terrible event ever occurred.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's an awesome game that is great for anybody who loves horses it's an amazing game that I would highly recommend
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I was able to get this on sale, and was sooo happy!  Gotta get caught up so that I can watch season 6!
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|I love Bowie, but this is crap! No rhythm, melody, or harmony. You would think one song in seventeen would be good. Nope
B004132HZS|5.0|Arrived as expected (widescreen format).  Great show, as is American version of Sherlock called 'Elementary' with Johnny Lee Miller.  Wife loves it... now on to season 2.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|This game worked once before the constant adds kept crashing it. Now even trying to load it will crash my Kindle Fire forcing me to hard reset. The one time it worked my kid loved it! Too bad!-)
0060589280|2.0|The characters’ were extremely unbelievable, the plot was ridiculous.  I really thought it sounded like a good intense read, but I was sorely disappointed.  It was not at all what I expected from the descriptions of both the book and its author.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! Reminds me of Jane Austen.  Little action, but lots of interactions. Waiting for more episodes.<br />.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great zombie show.  Good story line, good characters, good graphics.  We hope this show never ends.  Keep them zombies and shows coming.
0385349947|3.0|The notion that success and likeability for women have inverse correlation,  is an important one. At least women should stop resenting successful women...that will be a good place to start!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was definitely a good one. I have never read any books by Nicholas Sparks, but I'm glad I did. I couldn't put it down. It was a true love story with a little suspense.
B00456PKG4|4.0|I remember when this was in the theater it got trashed.  It is actually a really good fantasy adventure movie.  The acting was more than adequate, the stakes were good, the story logic was sound... I mean for the movie you expect to see, you get it in spades. It's fun, twisty, great effects, great villain, on and on.<br /><br />So why not 5-stars?<br /><br />Hmmm... I think because it's TOO on target. It's predictable in that you know the hero will not fail. The main character starts brazen and ends brazen, he starts heroic and ends heroic... but then if it had that level of character development it would've been up for an Oscar.  haha<br /><br />At the end of the day, if you have even an inkling of checking it out then you'll probably like it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Kept my interest but not an uplifting story.  This book was great for a book club.  Many social issues could be discussed.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game. Its great fun. Complex. Challenging. Intriguing. And. It was free. Such a fantastic deal. I would have paid and been happy.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|SIMPLE TO USE AND KEEPS THE ENTRIES ON THE SCREEN UNTIL U PRESS THE EQUALS SIGN. GO AHEAD AND TRY IT.

B004I1K2NW|5.0|I happen to think this movie is great. A great story, great Special Effects, great acting by a great cast.<br />Just a great movie!!
B000SW2F8K|4.0|Enjoyed this funny romance.  Penelope Cruz is delightful as an affected girl with equillibrium problems that she can't over come.
B00371QQ0M|1.0|So far, this is the worst blu-ray product I have ever seen.  There are large specks including large black square blocks in the beginning 5 minutes of the movie.  These specks should have been purposely processed to be removed.  If you're thinking this movie is old, take a good look at Ben Hur which looks pristeen.  If they wanted to clean it up they would have.  It seems like they didn't check their work after they finished.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The park is great I love the idea.  I have just started playing after my son showed me on his ipod.  I have a kindle and love playing the game.  I would love to see you make an X-box game out of it with more to do.  Like moving the building around 3-D, seeing real people walk the park.  I love any kind of building games.  Thanks for the chance to rate your game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you, Hugh. I just finished your book and I have to say that I was absolutely blown away. As I read every page I could feel every meticulously crafted detail falling into place. The imagery was so picturesque, I could imagine the fear in every character's heart, and that final bit towards the end, with the spoilers and what not, as I was reading it all I could think about was how amazing that would look in some form of media. At first I was thinking that a movie would be awesome but after seeing a reviewer mention TV series, it dawned on me that this could be very 24esque, if it was done properly. Don't sell the rights to this, lease them! Or at least maintain full creative control.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I really did love the War of Art by Steven Pressfield - I so quickly related to the procrastination (Resistance) that has kept me from accomplishing many things, mainly my Artwork, over my lifetime.  It helped me to make a plan to get on track with what I want to be doing and to set feasible goals for my creative endeavors (as well as my health-related improvement plan).<br /><br />I will forever be grateful for this little (quick read) book. Thank you Steven.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great stories.  Wonderful acting. Enjoyed watching the simple live with the same problems of today but with fewer people invalved.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game AWESOME!!!! It's one of those games you get addicted to and some of the guys you have to really want to take the challenge and collect eggs or coins. I LOVE this GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Wonderful & accurately depicted  historical account ..... Well done indeed .... Great service .... Peace always to you and yours:-)
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Unbelievably fascinating and emotionally draining.  I loved every minute of it!<br />The special effects were astounding.  I especially loved Richard Parker.  As<br />A retired actor myself, one having worked with both tigers and lions, I know<br />The problems involved in working with them!  I realize that much of the action with the tiger<br />Was computerized,  but it was a masterful job.  In my day, the tiger would have had<br />To be live and the difficulties would have been enormous!  Kudos to everyone<br />Involved with this wonderful picture!!
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Dick's Do Android Dream Of Electric Sheep is an astute look into the future, mixing themes from classic sci-fi to more mature and intellectual themes such as creation and the true meaning of life. Highly entertaining and thought-provoking, it's without a doubt one of the best sci-fi books out there. A must for all sci-fi fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's awesome and cool lol lol lol I have a horse named lightning she I s awesome and I love her
B009YU6FJM|5.0|A solid album, worth listening to many times all the way through. I haven't found one boring song on this album. Good job Deftones.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I chose this rating because the movie just takes you away to a place full of different people places and things I would recommend this movie for everyone of all ages  and I promise you that you will really enjoy this movie

B00B04KVMC|4.0|I saw the movie Sound City and I was really anxious to hear this collection of great artists.  I wasn't disappointed.  The vinyl is a must have (180gram sounds great).  There are a lot of audiophiles who are down on this because it lacks dynamic range.  I think the DR was decent, but in the end why do you buy music?  You buy it because you dig the songs, and appreciate the artists who create this stuff.  Don't pass up this album it's worth every penny.<br /><br />My judge of a great album is if I can put it on and just let it play through without skipping any songs.  I can definitely do that with Sound City (of course I do have to flip the vinyl ;-).  Thanks Dave Grohl another awesome creation!!!<br /><br />Favorite Songs:  Cut Me Some Slack (Sir Paul sounds young again) & Time Slowing Down (great harmonies)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This has is fantastic once you get into it I love horses so this game is a dream for me!!!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Some very insightful examples help explain the material.  I am recommending it to all my friends.  Well worth the time
1582701709|1.0|This is such a bad read - very small for the money and not worth purchasing at all - find a better one.
B007ONQ42O|5.0|I purchased this mostly because I was listening to music on YouTube and stumbled across Mz. Hyde.  I was surprised by the musical range that Halestorm has and am looking forward to seeing more from them as they grow.
0743270754|4.0|The book was a bit tedious at times.  however, it provided great insight into just how amazing a politician and leader Lincoln was.  The book provides strong support for those that argue that Lincoln was the greatest president.
B0026PA05M|4.0|I bought this album because a friend of mine played &#34;Familiar Taste of Poison&#34; at a gathering.  Then I had to buy the album!  Halestorm has a great musical range and I bought this album at the same time as &#34;The Strange Case Of...&#34;  I can't wait to see what this band comes up with next!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A great book dull of humanity and human foibles.  Highly recommended reading for anyone who enjoys a great story well-told
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Fun to see how the characters have developed from the first season to now.  Great gift for your favorite geek!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Great cartoon with outstanding graphics, reminded me of an Indiana Jones movie. Perfect family movie but would be difficult for preschool children to follow. I downloaded the film to my Kindle and use the cable bought from Amazon to plug into a flat screen TV, result was perfect.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I loved it it was an amazing game i loved the chicken board this yis a cool game i love playing it and i love the world tours
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Excellent story of courage and heroism.The human side of war is not always depicted.<br />This book shows how two different men viewed WWII.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is the best thing we've seen in so long.  We couldn't stop watching it!  We watched all three seasons in less than a week!  Can't wait for Season 4 to arrive.
030758836X|1.0|What a bizaare story!  At first the obscenities seem to be part of a character response.  Then they become more vile as the story degenerates into a devious plot so twisted that the language and actions are unredeemable.  The setting and circumstances are believable but the depth of deprivity exhibited by the characters is sordid.  This is not an entertaining book and I sincerely wish I hadn't read it.  Very offensive and disturbing!
0425252868|5.0|I just read this book over two days and couldn't stop until I finished. It was absolutely riveting AND inspirational. This needs to be a movie. How action-packed and moving it would be! Thank you for writing this book. As the daughter of a WW II veteran (now passed), I loved all the history, as my father served in the North African Campaign in the Army.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I like books like this because they are easy to read.  I've read most of Danielle's books and there isn't one I don't like.
B003Y3MYYU|5.0|This cycle of geniunely live performances in 1966 and 67 from Bayreuth is broadly contemporary to the Solti and Karajan cycles. It was recorded actually by by DG (DGG at that time) but languished on the shelf for some years because of company politics (i.e. Herbert von Karajan!). When Polydor, parent company of DG became part of newly formed Polygram it enabled the set to be released under the Philips imprimatur, at a price more than the cost of current Decca release. In todays terms it would be the equivalent of half a good week's wage-say around £250 (say $400!)! I have lived with all these recordings in Vinyl and CD and I have all the commercial recordings of the Ring, and some derived from radio or internet broadcasts. I have my favourite cycle overall and this is not it-but I would never part with it, and it is the top recommendation now because of the price. This is, and always has been, the best Bayreuth Live Ring, the Keilberth notwithstanding. There is nothing \\"historic\\" about the sound quality as with the Keilberth, and the casting forms a second \\"Golden Age.\\" Bohm's reading is swiftly paced, but never rushed and always masterfully shaped. He is not out to re-interpret the Ring-this is a Master Kapellmeister giving his best work, as with Keilberth.<br />There are flaws and drawbacks as with all live recordings, but fewer than with other live Rings-the prompter/repetiteur being all too often audible (just!) is a minor distraction, but Wieland Wagner's New Bayreuth productions were static, more like tableaux set against huge abstract sets with litlle scene changing-the result is less stage noise than on other recordings. The recording is very natural, with none of the dubious engineering of the Barenboim set where the voices are in a resonant acoustic totally alien to Bayreuth, and it is actually better recorded than the later Boulez. The Thielemann is similar in sound quality, but not in performance-avoid.<br />A few myths should be dispelled-Windgassen is a SUPERB Loge, wheedling, guileful and POWERFUL by turns-a real tour de force. Theo Adam is a SUPERB Wotan on this set-many of his later performances on disc were well-sung but dull-his Sachs for Karajan comes to mind-but here he excels in every way-strong characterisation, beautifully sung. He sounds youthful and virile in Rheingold, and more mature in his ,for me, superb Wanderer. Adam usually gets slated in comparison to Hotter-Hotter was not THAT great, and by the early 60's he was getting by on audience fond memory-his voice had developed a raggedness and wobble that made it torture to listen to, at least for me, one of the many reasons I do not rate the Knappertsbusch Parsifal as highly as others-but enough of Hotter, he had retired from these roles by 1967. Listen without prejudice and you will find Adam superb. James King is arguably the finest recorded Siegmund , at least in this recording, of the stereo era (Melchior is incomparable overall) and would that we had his like today.If Vickers was more impassioned for Karajan and Leinsdorf, then King is at least as heroic with steadier tone and less crooning. There is general conscensus that this is Nilsson's finest hour and she is indeed incomparably superb, and if Windgassen has to husband his resources a little more at this age, it is fascinating to hear him do so with such excellent results in his outstanding reading of Siegfried.He often sounds fuller and fresher than even on the 1955 set. The remaining cast is as if from a dream, with generally luxury casting for the minor roles, Neidlinger and Greindl as implacable and incomparable as ever, and even Thomas Stewart , by then already a great Wotan , giving us a superb Gunther. One weak link is Dvorakova as Gutrune,who starts off sounding too heavy of voice and who screams and wobbles alarmingly at times especially in her solo scene. Ironically, when this production premiered in 1965, the solo scene with Gutrune following Siegfried's death was cut-yes there are cuts even in the Temple of Wagner-but was restored the next year following the tsunami of vituperation that engulfed Wieland and Bohm for sanctioning it.Pity that Dvorakova-a fine singer who actually sang Brunnhilde in one of the 3 cycles in 66 &67 and was loved for this role in London -was way off form for this recording. Martha Modl's Waltaute is wobbly but dramatically strong but these are really the only major vocal glitches and are not catastrophic.<br />When I said this was not my absolute favourite recording, I am referring to hair's breadth preferences-in fact as I write this review, I begin to wonder if maybe it IS after all!<br />For those wanting to add to their collection, approaching the Ring anew, or wishing to experience a \\"Golden Age\\" of Wagner performing but without the sonic deficiencies-or cost-of the Keilberth, this is the absolute top recommendation. At this paltry price, ALL music lovers who do not own the set already should buy it without hesitation. Unlimited stars.

B008476HBM|3.0|I felt it was a very hard book to read.  I guess I liked the movie better.  I like a book that is easy to read and don't have to think about what I just read.  I'm going to try again because I love the movie.  A lot of characters to figure out.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Volumes have been written about this recording of the Ring which defined a new era in stereo recording. Despite my love and admiration of other sets by the likes of Keilberth, Karajan, Bohm and the undervalued if imperfect Levine, the Solti Ring was and remains my first love for these works. I am not blind (deaf?) to its faults-I regret the casting of a Hans Hotter well past his best, it would have been good to have had a fresher voiced Siegfried, though I love Windgassen in the role-and Stolze's Mime is not my favourite-but this cycle has the fewest \\"dud \\" castings.<br />As for Solti as conductor, I don't think he ever mastered W&auml;lkure, and his emphatic conducting style doesn't suit everyone's taste. I recall critic Michael Tanner asserting that the Solti Ring was the best to choose for \\"dipping\\" in and out, for no matter what the excerpt being played, there would be an exciting climax along in a few minutes!<br />I love the excitement, drama and grandeur he brings to the score overall.<br />With the passage of time, most of the mysteries have been de-mystified, rumours confirmed or debunked, and secrets revealed.<br />Decca recouped most of its initial production costs on the sale of sets in the late 50's and 60's-most of which were in Mono! Since then it has been a veritable \\"cash cow\\" for Decca reappearing in various guises and remasterings. Rheingold was first remastered in 1968, to bring the sound to the levels of the later sets released under Decca's \\"SET\\" Sonicstage\\" imprimatur, and it upgraded from SXL to SET with a consequent increase in price. With the advent of CD, Decca's first transfer was neither satisfactory nor cheap-they even released Rheingold on 3 Full Price CD's, though this was later reduced to 2. The main problem was an inordinate amount of tape hiss. James Locke wrote at length about how disappointed he was with the end results. It was inevitable that when the technology permitted, a new improved version would emerge which it duly did.<br />The1997 Reconstruction by Jimmy Locke was not universally well received. It was far more than the application of Cedar 2 Filtering. When the team went back to the original EMI manufactured master tapes, whole sections had disintegrated-very careless of Decca! However, they did have a plethora of out takes /alternative takes, many of which had been rejected purely for minor artistic reasons-they were not necessarily flawed, so they were able to reconstruct a new pristine master tape, which was not of course identical to the original recordings. They did however omit a whole semiquaver in the second scene of Rheingold! Not only did they remaster it at 20bits-and Cedar 2-but they remixed it, providing a far less artificial balance than the records had given. For the first time, with Nilsson in a truer perspective for example, her singing sounded less steely and more radiant. More importantly, orchestral presence was detectable in the sounds of scraping chairs, a dropped bow-a door closing, podium squeak from Solti etc.<br />Personally, I loved it-but others moaned that it had changed the character, was too compressed etc.<br />My view is that in domestic as opposed to \\"lab\\" conditions, it was such a huge improvement over the first release that no-one could or should complain. Too many correspondents are listening to the recording, not the music!<br />For this new release-they have reassembled a new master again based on the 1997 version-and have restored the missing semi-quaver, eliminated some obvious edits, re-balanced yet again -and transferred at 24 Bits. On CD alone the difference is immediately palpable-the bass is firmer and tauter, even more detail is revealed, it is certainly less compressed and sounds as though it could have been recorded last week. Rheingold in particular benefits-the cellos and basses don't sound like revving motorbikes any more, and a slight edgy quality to the upper strings and brass has gone. I have detected none of the edits I couldbefore!<br />The Blu-ray is a step further-the music leaps out the speakers like having the VPO in the room, and you feel as if you could reach out and touch the singers, such is their presence!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't read such a good story for years. It's a breathtaking and keeps you reading and reading to find out more interesting things to come. And they come. Really very good story and storytelling. Thank you for the good time.
1939416019|2.0|I bought this looking for a new fantasy series to read, based upon the positive reviews.  From now on I am going to start with the bad reviews before wasting money.  This story is Rice's take on the farm/pig/pauper/etc. boy makes good.  What is that Bildungsroman?  The plot is very thin.  The chronological time that elapses between events is almost entirely too fast.  Boy goes to city.  Boy gets dream, yet tough assignment in military.  Boy meets girl.  Boy get's adopted by royal family.  Boy becomes hero, in what appears to be about a week of story time.  The overall idea is not bad, just overdone.  The grammar is poorly put.  I cannot figure what the author did to spite the editor that caused so much poor editing to be done.  I am sure no one ever \\"peaked\\" out from under a hood while having clandestine encounters in a dark \\"would\\".  I was left with the feeling that the author was winging it in terms of the setting and elements of the world created, and was hated by the editor of the book.  Overall the story's general plot could have been a warm romp through familiar fantasy territory, maybe it became so by book 4, but I won't ever know because I could not finish this book.  I was gritting my teeth in annoyance by 200 pages in, at what at first seemed like sloppiness in language and weak plot story telling, and ultimately became an overwhelming, page by page issue/theme.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Very good game and storyline. Could always be longer but fun game. Keep up the good work. Thank you G5. Wendy
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Very refreshing tv show.  There is nothing like it on tv.  It is best to start at the beginning and go through the entire series.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Seriously, this is childproof.  I'm a med student that converted to Notability for notes and love this stylus.  The one negative is that you have to press with a bit more force on the iPad, but seeing as this is how I naturally write, this product is my best friend.  It's big enough that you can see it rolling off the desk, and it's also easy to throw in your bag, pocket, pencil case, whatever.  Yes, it looks like a big crayon, but I guarantee you I could break any other competing stylus in a week's time.  This is a good investment and no-brainer.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I originally bought this little game for my niece but soon found myself playing along with the simple, fun and strangely addictive mini games. I must give fair warning,the little critters in the game are dangerously cute.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I loved this game it was hard but not to hard that will make you want to slam your device on the ground I LOVED this game
B004HD61KE|5.0|James Rollins keeps you fully engaged in this thrilling and mind challenging novel of secret societies, native American history, appocoliptic events stemming back to the founding fathers time to present day.  I highly recommend this novel.  It's a great read.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Loved all the clues and challenges.  Was sorry to finish.  Woule like to see a longer game and more like this
1592407889|5.0|I thought the book was extremely well written.  It was a sad,funny,and surprising story,all at the same time. The last autobiography I loved was \\"Unbroken...\\" by Laura Hillenbrand. I didn't think I would like this as much, but found myself just as sucked in and totally absorbed by the writing and telling of a remarkable life. I hope to see it someday on stage and/or screen!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was really fun and challenging.  Really liked the format including spoilers which I really need sometimes.<br />More games like this please
0375703861|2.0|I enjoyed this original and interesting novel. It's amusing to the point where I laughed out loud ( a rare occurrence while reading), and yet  themes are serious enough to give readers something to consider, to think about.  It's worth reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game because it fun. I play the game at my grandma`s house after I get off of the bus. This game is exciting it has a lot of action!!!!
0439023521|1.0|My daughter was required to read this book for school. I personally knew about the book and hadn't thought her school would require such a thing. I read the book when she was done and despised it. For starters I think that it is a complete rip-off of Battle Royale, both the characters and plot. I strongly advise that parents are cautious with allowing their children to read the Hunger Games. It is highly inappropriate for any child and can even give young people ideas of killing. Not only was the concept horrific but the book itself was poorly written. The writing was amateurish and the characters do not develop and are flat and one-dimensional. To make matters worse the trilogy just gets darker and the dull writing continues. Katniss has no redeeming development qualities throughout the entire trilogy. She, along with everyone else in the book remains uninteresting and undeveloped. The movie was no better, it was overlong, horrific and dull. No young child should read this trilogy or see the movie due to its dark and terrifying concepts. I could not understand everyone's love for such a thing as this. The trilogy and the movie is not worth anyone's time or money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hope they make a great movie (or more) with this story, the material is there, and good ideas in science fiction are so scarce lately. The books are great and the ideia behind them extraordinary. Thanks Hugh Howey!
630542845X|5.0|I really thank you for this movie. It is an all time classic and I really love it. Thanks, Your valued customer!!!

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Osmos is a fun and easy to learn game that provides hours of great entertainment.  It only takes minutes to learn, but hours to master.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I like the content of the program, the characters, costumes and all the detail to make you believe it is really happening.
B00BMVTTJ4|1.0|As of March 15, 2013 purchase date, the instant video department is working to correct streaming issues with this movie.  It streams until the 41st minute and then restarts at the beginning.  No other information given.<br /><br />I am sure the movie will be a great adventure...in its entirety.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game! It has amazing graphics and lots of things to explore, also I love the movie and I love this game! It's truly my favorite game now and ALSO THE MOVIE IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE ALSO!!! :)

B0016492BW|5.0|I have been a Monty Python fan for over 35 years. This movie is the start of my collection. British humor is so cheeky and I truly enjoy this troupe of actors.
0307472590|5.0|Nice argument, nice descrptions of the characters locations and lifestyles of a 1920's spanish society in the city of Barcelona, the main character experiences a sort of adventures and twists during the develop of the story which keeps you attached to the story all the time. Keep in mind there is two other books connected with this...
B00005JNQS|5.0|This movie is pretty cute. My whole family loves it from the 15 year old to the 3 year old. It's a quirky movie but that's what makes it so cute.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. What an amazing man and family, very inspiring! Rest in peace
0345803485|4.0|I think it is important to remember this book is a fantasy.  Ok, it's not as well written as[[ASIN:B00BSDS1HW Jane Austen: Complete Collection of Works and Historical Background (Annotated and Illustrated) (Annotated Classics)]] and the sex isn't as hot or intense as [[ASIN:B00BE9T6DI All For Nun (All For Nun Sexploitation Series)]], but it is a great introduction to the world of erotic romance, and I for one and really glad to see Erotic Writing (which is really important for women as a genre)getting the main stream love like this.<br />I read a lot of classic literature, and contemporary lit, and I still had a lot of fun with this novel. Its great to switch off and just immerse yourself in something that is fun. Christian Gray may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the thought of a completely competent man (I mean materially competent) taking control so that you have so many things that you want without having to work for it is a wonderful fantasy. In real life, I prefer the struggle and to get things for myself, but after a hard days work, I had a great time with a glass of wine and the dream that a man like Christian Gray who will cater unselfishly to my every need (material, sexual and emotional) could really exist, even if in my own mind. Is that childish?  Sure!  But I'm enjoying my fantasy in a safe sane and consensual way, and I never ever think it is going to come true. If you don't take this book too seriously, its a great fun read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ish gud stuff to play ladat and its ezay if you try ladat.  hahaha hahaha hahaha. k den shoots b
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I love Matthew in this flick. Actually, I enjoy most of his flicks. He's got that extra something special that only a few actors have. He has the aire about him that he could actually pull off being a stree-savvy lawyer.
B002C949KE|1.0|I have no idea how Ariely calls any of the &#34;case studies&#34; he describes in this book &#34;empirical&#34;! I can shoot holes through every one of them! I found it tedious and exhausting to read through these examples that seemed steeped in white upper class ethnocentrism. I begged my book club to wait at least five years before ever selecting anything involving behavioral economics again! I can't express how intellectually insulting the entire field is... this book is it's poster child!
B0094K1JPC|5.0|This, too, was a good story. I loved seeing Harrison Ford in it. He brought a sort of je'ne sais que.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read !  Hard to put the book down...loved the ending this book and wanted more at the end of this lovely book...
B005DNBDXM|5.0|I could watch this over and over. I love the suspense even though I already know what's going to happen. I guess I'm secretly hoping that things will change.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is fantastic. I`ve never had any issues.  I absolutely love the fact I can keep track of all my many thoughts and categorize them without polluting my desk with sticky notes.  It is also so great that I can access it from anywhere and on any device.
B001JQM7TG|5.0|For anyone that want to lead a successful life (career, education, relationships, &/or spiritual) it is all laid out with the why' s and & how to's.  You can skip the formal education process and have all the tools you need with this book.  I learned to many valuable things and have a deeper understanding of the laws of the universe.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Good awesome  great for kids  and  adults who are ready to learn more about to say stuff and learn more
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Good to see there are still some real musicsians in the rock world.  Unique sound.  Liked almost every song.  Wish it had the curse on this CD.  Looks for it on the EP if you buy and like this CD.
0062082353|5.0|A very well written book and I found it very easy to read. It tells of what many go through to protect us.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|Great CD, every song is good.  You can't go wrong...good to see there are a few real musicians still in the world
1451695187|3.0|Not as good as I expected, not written very well. I enjoyed reading it; however, some of the choice of words in key parts of the book were very poor.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|One of my all time favorites, this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat until the last minute. A true story, and worthy winner of several awards.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|First of all, I have to state that I am a big fan of the Eagles and their music. Their songs, music, and lyrics are outstanding. I had this presentation in the DVD format, but I traded it to a \\"non-HD\\" friend of mine for a bottle of Napa Cab---a great trade for both of us! So now about the Blu-ray: The picture and sound are both considerably better than the DVD. For the \\"trade-up\\" people, this is worth the upgrade, given what I said above, but also because it's all on one disc with no interruptions. One caveat: there is no bookmarking capability. If you \\"stop\\" the disc, even without removing it and keeping the power on, it starts from the beginning when \\"play\\" is again selected. This is not a good feature for quite a lengthy disc. There are times when I'm watching a music video that I want to continue it at a later time, so having the bookmark is very desirable. Please note that I'm using an OPPO BDP-93, so features are not an issue. I contacted Rhino Music about this, and they said there were no plans to correct this, but they would forward my email to the suggestion department. All-in-all, I do recommend this blu-ray, but please beware of its limitations, and only use the pause button for any interruptions.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This app just stays on the first screen with the setup and never goes to the digital clock. Just Crappy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Make sure you have plenty of time when you watch this. Once you start it's hard to stop. It's highly addictive.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Quick, clear, easy to set up and presto, there it is. No muss, no fuss. Even an easy snooze button.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Don't want to put it down. Keeps me entertained for hours. Am sure you WILL feel the same way.
B001BKG9SA|3.0|I wouldn't recommend this to many people. His Pink Floyd material is the best. The Delicate Sound of Thunder CDs are out of this world.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|As usual Sparks doesn't disappoint. The plot took turns you don't expect which makes you not want to put it down. Easy read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have yet to play, but my boys love it! They give it a 2 thumbs up... I think it looks fun.
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|This book didn't leave any lasting impression on me.  Very ok, nothing more nothing less.  If you liked the show, chances are is that you'll feel the same.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I thought that the at the book was very detailed and well thought out. I recommend this book to anyone who likes wondering what is going to happen next, what Olaf will try to do to Violet, Sunny, and Klaus.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a really good book but it was sad in some places like when Boggs died. This was a really good book
B008I3RARW|4.0|All you who gave less than 3 stars have standards that are too high. Of course I don't think its worth 5 bucks, should be free forever. But its a fun functional game. Steering was great, I had no issues with throttle or brake. Third pedal is reverse btw. Needs more tracks, and more car options wouldn't hurt. Will give 5 stars when/if more tracks are added
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Heart-stirring.  It's the story line that keeps one interested.  No sex or swearing.  So glad it had a happy ending. In my opinion, this is how movies should be.  They should lift your spirits and build faith.  Of course, being about a War Horse, there is a measure of violence and war scenes.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|One of the best.classics ever easy.and fun and.not time.staking.  I have to read a classic for.school and this was perfect
0062082353|4.0|I thought Chris's book was a terrific read. Just sorry, that he is no longer with us. The world, could use a lot more men with such great character and would be better off for it.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|it was better but there is a facebook log in glich. I even uninstalled and reinstalled and the glich remains please fix it. I also lost my whole world
B002VUFKG6|3.0|I found this self-serving of the author, did not have sympathy for the charactors, and wondered what the fuss was all about. So, choose a neutral territory and get on with your lives, already.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm on this 5th book in a span of 1 month and half of reading after work and still loving the whole saga. But I am trying to slow down in reading the 5th book as I know George Martin is still writing the 6th book which would be finished god knows when... Kinda reminds me of the waiting time for the Harry potter books.<br /><br />George write faster please!
B00340LM8C|5.0|This film offers a romantically indulging escape to Cannes.  The HD quality looked stunning from a basic streaming player.  If you like 1950s films or if you want an impeccable introduction to Hitchcock's films, then you can't go wrong by starting here.  Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are a great team in this film as well.  I had to watch it twice!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I like the story, how George Martin was able to conjure a whole labyrinth of a story involving multiple character and layers and layers of plots and subplots all set centuries ago. Makes me glad I live in this century!<br /><br />Difficulty would be if you want to go back to a particular chapter, as all chapters re titled after the pov character. I wish he would have put sub titles for each chapter.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I luv this game. just wish the man can run faster and can drive all vehicles at anytime and that the vehicles were cheaper. I want the monster truck but its taking forever to get there.
1400069807|2.0|I don't understand the need for this unending stream of books that tell us about the same things over and over ad nauseam. We all know about this. Really! If you do enough research and read (or have already read) a few books on the subject you can probably write you own. I don't think it's as important to know the details of where we are on the health issue as it's important to know that we are here, have been here for too long and we need to leave this place as quickly as possible. Honestly, who here can say they are not aware of the problems we are living through regarding the food industry and our health? It's in our face every single day. I don't care whether they are doctors, scientists or award-winning journalists, far too many media-obsessed \\"experts\\" have gotten into this \\"fad\\" for the purpose of possibly making money easily and each one has her take on it. And consumers keep falling for this. I suppose reading a book is easier than actually doing the right thing for yourself. I believe we are just as addicted to these books are we are to our salt, sugar and fat.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|A very interesting, research filled but not boring book explaining some of the newest ideas in education, specifically how inner city schools might have improved results with students. There are still many gaps, grades where students still need support, but at least there is hope! Obviously money and dedicated personnel are major factors to further and expanded success.
0679731725|5.0|This is one of the finest novels I've ever read.  The narrative is by Stevens, the head butler at an English estate in the 1930s, and the novel follows the estate and Stevens through WWII to the postwar period.  The language is precise, reflecting Stevens's character.  He takes pride in his job, one aspect of which requires that his wishes and personality disappear behind those of the lord of the estate.  An excellent movie was made from the book, and the book is worth reading even after having seen the movie.  The novel deals with issues of class, obligation, responsibility, and agency - themes that appear in other books by Ishiguro.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Although I am reading this book quite a bit later than my peers (and, I'm embarrassed to say) in light of the popularity of the movie, I found Life of Pi to be a wonderfully artistic and conceptually inspired read. I rated this book with four stars as opposed to five with my only complaint being the occasionally unnecessary use of highly descriptive and prolonged gore. In understanding that extremity was an essential element to the book's character, it was simply a little too much for my taste at times.<br />Overall, a wonderful book.
B00B23O96A|3.0|Clapton's last self-titled album from 2010 was one of the few albums in my very large collection that I could count on to put me to sleep every time. After listening to sound clips on this one, I thought that it would be more of the same and was hesitant to buy it. Since I ordered the Super Bowl DVD for the Ravens' season and was going to pay S&H, I added this one to my order for another six bucks to get free S&H. I am glad that I bought it. However, this time around, EC has kept the snoozarama cuts to a minimum of three (cuts 3,8, and 12). For those of you who don't like reggae influenced music, this is not good news for you on this one, since there are four of these cuts (tracks 1,5,10, and one of the new songs, cut number 11). Both of the new songs were written by Doyle Bramhall II and friends, and both are very good songs. The aforementioned 11th cut Every Little Thing has hit potential with it's love song verses and reggae influenced chorus, bridge, and outro. The other new song is called Gotta Get Over, and is the only rocker, and the only one to be played on his 2013 tour from this release. The two surprises that I wound up liking after judging otherwise on the sound clips are Goodnight Irene and Angel. As for tracks 6 and 7, I can take those or leave it. Overall, this one is much more upbeat than his last one, which did not take much effort to improve. However, this one also will never rank among his classics. Now, since EC is so fond of doing covers these days, I reckon that we will never hear him give Rockin' Chair by George Jones a shot, because he could never believe those lyrics.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is by far the best 007 of them all, and I loved all of them.  You'll definitely enjoy it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It is very easy to use and it works.  I think it meets all of the expectations and convenience that anyone would want.
B0050UEVNM|1.0|Could tell some of these actors were just starting out.  A waste of good talent in this movie.  Don't waste your money.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks romance. Too familiar to my own life. I won't see the movie. It was a fast read.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Best James Bond ever.  Good story line.  Daniel Craig is great. Love the theme song and singer too.  Hope there are many more.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I LOVED this game. I was addicted, and I still highly reccomend it to anyone that does not have a kindle fire. But, when I try to open the app now, it crashes. Not exactly my idea of a great game. I've also noticed it's not mist my kindle it happens to. In my honest opinion I still love the game, I'm just upset I cannot play it.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|So glad to see Michael in his element for the last time. Truly entertaining and great ebay vendor. Received on time.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is such a great book! Twists and turns and fun abound in this book. It will keep you guessing until the very end!
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|Just got this in the other day, and as soon as I was able to, (even though it was 2 am!) popped this puppy in the blu ray player.<br /><br />Within about 2.5 seconds I was &#34;back&#34; in love again!<br /><br />This transfer is about 90% perfect!<br /><br />The opening scene pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the rest of the transfer.<br /><br />The music, (even though it's James Horner's soundtrack, it actually doesn't sound like his typical &#34;80's style stuff!)<br /> It's perfectly crisp and clear, nicely laid throughout the entire movie. Minimal need to adjust volume throughout the movie.<br /><br />The sounds (nature sounds, etc...) came through VERY nicely, I swear they re-made every sound they did just for this release!) It sounds just that new!  Exceptionally done indeed!<br /><br /> Both 5.1 sound and 2.1 sound options available, nifty!<br /><br />The color / images / grain ... There IS grain running throughout, but it's not so bad. I feel like there was about 10% - 25% more room for improvement, but perhaps there were more limits than I can imagine. In other words, I give the grain about a B+ to A) score.<br />  The colors were crisp and even, and really great through out (for the most part, more on that in a minute).<br /><br />Ron Howard's and George Lucas's imagery and hard work and dedication really are expressed very well here. It's no wounder he went on to be as successful as he did!<br /><br />The ONLY thing I would say didn't age well, on a technical level, were the little miniaturized &#34;Wood brownies&#34;.<br />  What can I say... but... &#34;uhg&#34;... nearly every time they were superimposed over the main action sequences, i got kinda squeamish and uncomfortable, and more than a little bit embarrassed for Ron Howard.<br /><br />I can't imagine how they could have made them more &#34;blended in&#34; to the scenery, or if they thought no one would notice the really  dramatic color differences, but it just doesn't fit the level of excellence that the rest of the movie really brings home.<br /><br />And worse, is these characters provide little to the actual &#34;plot / story&#34;. Evident even in watching how Willow and Val Kilmers character &#34;react&#34; to them. (it's minimal at best).  Most of the action and scenes could have been carried out without the two continuing on the rest of the journey.  I have to believe that they only got the job cuz of their friendship / previous working relationship, with Ron Howard and the lot. (Ron Howard does do a lot of hiring of the friends and family first as a general practice).<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars, is indeed for the Wood Brownies, they just didn't fit well on a visual level, and there was a small part of a star taken off for the minimal extras..<br /><br />The extras that are on there are quality though, so for what that's worth.<br /><br />There is no &#34;commentary while watching&#34;, which, lets face it, would have been brilliant to have on this set! Warik, Ron, and Val all back together again?!?! Now THAT would be a sett!<br /><br />But the other extras that are there are cute enough, and largely satisfying on some level... but at the end of seeing them, I still wanted more for some reason.<br /><br />There are two small extra bits that are sort of &#34;mini - interviews&#34; with Ron and Warik, but nothing from anyone else of significance.<br /><br />One extra is a little mis-leading, it's called &#34;Wariks video diaries&#34;... but it's not really... it's only a few clips from his rather extensive extra filming and him talking around the few clips they did show.  Again, to have the complete diary!!? THAT would be a TRUE Willow complete collection!!!<br /><br />This is a really nice treatment, long over due, clearly this was done with love and much consideration to the fans, and at least a small risk for them to put out, after all, there isn't a huge demand for 80's movies, and this wasn't even their largest block buster movie for either Ron, George, Val or Warik. So they were going out on a limb, and it's much appreciated by this fan!!<br /><br />  At under twenty bucks, this was a great deal / value for the money, and I hope anyone that has any fond memories of this from the theater... old or new fans, or soon to be fans... will run and get this right away!<br /><br />Get this release! Your family and your Friday night will thank you!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|In 20 minutes, I've sweat as much and felt like I've worked out as hard as I have on a few of the 50 minute videos I already have at home by other instructors.  Definitely a great work out and anyone can do it.  All you need is a mat and a pair of dumbbells.  I dropped it a star because, despite the work out, I really just am not a fan of Jillian.  She may know her stuff but her attitude and the sound of her voice do not do it for me at all.  Volume off on this one.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Just a brief review of the movie, and then a brief review of the blu ray.<br /><br />First, I'm a huge Bond fan, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like it so much instantly.<br /><br />Is this a &#34;tight plot / perfect story&#34; movie? No.<br /> Are there more than a few plot holes and questions that go strangely unanswered? Yeaop!<br /> Is this &#34;the best Bond movie ever&#34;? Hmmm... not as much ....<br /><br />But... are you going to have a great time watching it? OH YEAH!<br /> Are you in for a treat? yeaop!<br /> Are you going to escape to exotic locations for a while and relax?!?  Yes!!<br /> Are you going to loose yourself in the beautiful women and landscapes? Indeed!<br /> Is there a devious dark baddy bad guy that you want to love to hate!?!? 100% yes!<br /><br />It has many of the &#34;trappings&#34; of a great movie, it's a bit short on the &#34;Bond toys&#34;, but there is a small explanation provided, for now at least, and lets hope they change that as they make more movies.<br /><br />It's got M, and Q and Bond, and that's nearly all you need for a solid Bond movie, and a good time.<br /><br />As long as you're not expecting something else, you're not going to be disappointed with this purchase!<br /><br />The blu ray portion,<br />It plays nicely with a good sound system, and the bigger the screen you can get to watch it, the better you're going to love it!<br /><br />Not very many extras, but i didn't find myself wandering over too much looking for them for some reason...<br /><br />The vocals are super crisp and I didn't need to adjust the volume or anything like that hardly ever.<br /><br />The images are very nicely presented, and the hard work that everyone put in really paid off.<br /><br />This blu -ray / movie will age well I imagine. In 5, 10 or 20 years, this will still be enjoyable and easy to watch.<br /><br />if you are unsure to get this or not, just know that if you like / love Bond, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If youdon't know Bond well, or at least a fan of Daniel Craig, then this may not be the movie for you, and you'll feel sort of empty for most of the movie.<br /><br /> But other than that... get the butter, pop corn, soda, and the best seat in the house, cuz it's just this is just about the most fun you are going to have this side of the blu ray player!
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|love this mans body of work with the animals war and his solo career don't bring me down introduced me to him and since i have been a lifelong fan
0811879542|5.0|I found this book in a 2 year old's book basket today. We read it together and it was very cute watching him interact with the book's direction. He liked pressing on the dots, helping me shake the book and blowing on the colors. But his favorite was the clapping. :) In fact, after he read the book with me, he wanted to go back to the clapping page. Press Here is very creative and imaginative. It teaches children how to follow simple directions and see the results of following those directions. I wish it came in a board book format because I would definitely get this book for my toddler classroom!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I have read many, if not most of the reviews of Rush's latest studio effort.  I have to say that I share the opinion of many that the sound quality of this effort (at least in the CD or downloaded versions) is sub par.  Actually, that is a nice way of putting it.  I will never understand how Neil, Geddy, and Alex ever approved of the release of this work in its current muddy/over-compressed state.  I felt the same way about \\"Vapor Trails,\\" and believe both works have some really great songs that don't get their due because of production inadequacies.  I saw the current tour of \\"Clockwork Angels\\" and thought it sounded great live.  I might be selfish, but I believe Rush fans are owed a better-sounding product than what the guys have been offering of late.  And I mean better only in production quality...the musicianship, songwriting, and effort are obviously still there.  I've been an avid fan since around 1975, have seen Rush live in every decade of their existence, and am now feeling sadly disappointed that these great musicians haven't controlled the production of their music to a greater (more sound-friendly) extent.  Finally, I have no problem with Geddy's singing on this or on any Rush album...he is a unique-sounding singer, obviously has lost some range, but he isn't getting any younger and I love the fact that he is still doing his thing.
0061438294|4.0|I bought this book because a coworker had it on his desk and when I discussed it with him he said it was a great idea for anyone in the field of animation to read books on body language as it will help create better animations.<br />The book has parts that are a bit dry and other parts that are a little easier to read and memorable. It certainly wasn't one I couldn't put down and honestly ended up in the bathroom as a bathroom reader.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Got it pretty quickly, and in new condition.  Rocks some serious blues. Its only my fourth Bonamassa album and  i cant wait on getting more.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album met my expectations and more. This a truly unique must have album. I can't stop listening to it!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I really liked this continuation of the Percy Jackson and the Half-Bloods story.It is an easy read and many young people should enjoy it.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Absolutely addictive! This is the first time I've played this type of game and I'm hooked. It's now a quest to finish all 100 levels. Buy it and have fun'
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I like the story arc, The introduction of the Roman versions of Heroes and Deities makes for a nice twist.
1476715904|5.0|This book was a combination of self-revelations, growth, love, heartache, and struggle and Colleen Hoover couldn't have done a better job! Her story was heart-pounding and one of those books that once you start reading you just can't put it down, considering I read it in 24 hours. Not only was it a good, fun read, but it made me think about my life and see it in a different way. Not many books have the ability to do that... HIGHLY recommended.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am really impressed with this continuation of the Greek/Roman Half-Blood series. I eagerly await the last in the series...
B005H0IW76|5.0|I have always loved this particular Christmas album, and the Limited Edition simply enhances the beauty of this CD. It features two or three extra songs that are worth looking into with this CD. All of the songs featured on this CD are amazing, and I would recommend anyone to add this to their Christmas music collection.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|this game took a while to download and I had to figure out how to get to the hidden objects that were behind the objects list but all in all it was a good game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesomesr game ever I loved it and so has everybody I know love love it it it I know you will like it
B000JQU4TW|3.0|my girlfriend had gotten this and forgot that i was still signed into my own amazon account, i dont read much
B007EECSFA|2.0|It was a great story. It kept me guessing until the end. I love Kate Morton's books! I can't wait to read another one.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Thank you Mr Rodriguez ... you made a man cry watching this film and your music.  You have such a gift, and I respect your humility.  I will cherish your albums for the rest of my life.  God bless.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Two years ago I took a  calcium score test (a quick ct scan of your heart) $50.00 @ my clinic. My score was off the charts, six months and two stints later I was looking for looking for answers. My current cardiologist didn't offer much in the way of what I probably already knew, drop the weight and exercise. But as far a what I eat, nothing much, same old food pyrimid etc. I will admit I had read about the glycimic Index but not the way Dr Davis relates it to the wheat we eat. Not to drone on and on I suggest anyone with heart diesase read this book. If you don't have any problems you can start living better right now by reading this book.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Bought back to memories of the  Iranian crisis that happen in the Carter presidency.  Movie gave us insight to one suffessful recue effort by our CIA  and the help of our  Canadian friends in the north helping us.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it is awesome I play against my Facebook friends and we have a ton of fun! I can't stop playing the game it has easily become addicting . Lol
B0098VXMNE|4.0|except for the slow connection (which the problem is not my internet) its a good deal. the season is great as expected
B005WYFLNU|5.0|These stickers were well worth the small price they sell for. My almost 2 year old loves them and and they have already provided lots of entertainment.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I don't really like the Nick Fury character making plugs in favor of the Police State.  But what saved it was Fury's hint that the 'police state' had made mistakes with Captain America.  So, you had some of both, but I would have preferred less propaganda.  The actors in this film were less cocky, and more 'stomachable' than all the other new movies I have seen.  Good story. Believable.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The pictures are ok...but the ability to take a picture like a camera is very limited.  Camera lense faces the operator not the direction of view.  Poor overall Kindle operation from this standpoint.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The first time the dwarves sang in the beginning I thought I was in trouble.  A bit silly.  The second and last time they sang was ok.  I know it is keeping with the books, but still.  Characterization is important to these movies as well, so I didn't mind the 2 times it dragged.  I think it was needed.  Other than that it was a beautiful movie.  I have read all the Tolkein books including Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, so it was close enough.  Very pretty movie.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It's fun and all but it stopped loading on my kindle. it wont let me play at all. This needs to be fixed.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This is a really good book. Similar to &#34;The book thief&#34;. Definately had a few plot twists. Well worth the<br />read. This is the first book I've read from this author and I really liked her writing style. Even tho the story<br />is set in Paris, there are few French words so it was not hard to follow. Has some sad parts but overall<br />not too depressing as some holocost books can be. I will definately read more books by this author in the future!
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|Have had the case for about a month and it works well.  It keeps my iPhone &#34;safe&#34;!  It's a good basic cover for the phone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this Bible. Have listened to it as much as I wanted to but love having in on my Kindle. So easy to get to and find the verses you need. I would reccommend everyone to have this.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|kids loved this and so did we! a little dark so be careful with the uber sensitive child.It teaches a great lesson, fear never wins!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Love this app. I listen to ocean waves everynight when I go to bed. Sounds like you are laying right on the beach. There is still some things I don't understand how to do but have not taken the time to figure it out but it has been worth it. Love it and would recccommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is so much easier then using my old school cellphone calculator. the &#34;buttons&#34; are very large (i use on kindle fire hd) so that is good especially if you have trouble seeing those tiny cell phone calculators.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's so addicting.  Some reason I haven't gotten my update on my kindle.  I do wish I could chat with friends that are on my team within the app.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I bought this so i could read it before I went to see the movie.. I still have not seen the movie but have bought the entire series and Love them!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I was surprised to find how similar to my own were the dilemas of young women in a past time. I could easily identify with these characters. This is more proof to me that human nature remains the same over time.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|great acting, great story and just an all round great movie. I was unsure if it would be too slow but the storyline kept my attention.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love games like this. It's fun not to easy and gets your mind going. Wish it didn't stop so short I was on a roll lol
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I LOVED this book. It was a really fast read which made me a little sad, i wanted it to last. I liked it so much I bought the next 2 in the series and read them over the next couple of weeks. If you are like me a busy mom that just wants to be entertained out of reality for a little while this will do it!!
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I have had good luck with RAM products in the past and wasnt disapointed with this one. It worked well on my Colorado Elk hunt
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved all three books!!  Wish there was a fourth in the series!<br />Will be reading g more by Suzanne Collins
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Just like many other keyboards you have to swipe accurately in order to get the correct words to display. With Swype, you can mess up and it still figures out what you mean.
1607053888|5.0|I have the hardest time following a pattern and they did an amazing job of keeping the instructions simple. I also love all the photos which is great for a visual person like me. The patterns are also easy to adjust for size, and style if you want to change/add something. It's a really great book and I'm so happy with all the bags I've made from it.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|In the 1970s / 80s I watched the Tom Baker years of the original Doctor Who, which made me love the show.  In the 2000s I started back with David Tennant, which again made me love the show.  His version of the character was exciting, emotional and went to all sorts of crazy places!  Traveling back to Earth's past is interesting, but going to another planet, meeting aliens or going into the future (to me) is much more interesting.  I can watch Seasons 2, 3 or 4 almost anytime!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I love this movie, the graphics are great and the price for it was good, looking to get the Complete edition next.
0064400557|5.0|3rd graders should keep their school books in school. They can bring their books home but you will have to deal with books being left at home, forgetting to take them to school consistently. Not to mention how heavy they are to be carried back and forth, creating a need to purchase a roller bag pack which is best for 4-5 grader and above.<br />So I took a picture of the ISBN numbers and bought a duplicate of all the 6 books. Now we have a set that is to be kept in school and a set to be kept at home; it makes things easier. Happy to find all of them on Amazon.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very cute. And I'm buying things for cash, I don't normally do that. You will like it. Upgrades are cute, love the dragons.
0596101996|5.0|The book is very informative. However, I didn't benefit from its content simply because I found an online training service (Lynda.com) and I prefer that medium of learning over traditional book learning.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Can't play without downloading additional programs.  This is not usable without doing more than I am willing to do.  Would not recommend it to anyone.
1573300403|5.0|The King of Pop is truly an iconic figure. It's wonderful to see any kind of footage of his work and genius. This is the second DVD of a two part DVD set.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is just like when I was younger.  I enjoy the challenge, I don't need an instructions book to play the game.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I had trouble navigating to get the product working.  I finally was able to look up a video and play it, but I haven't figured out how to save it to a playlist yet.  It works great on my Kindle Fire and is a good replacement for my computer which has no sound..
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|There are more outstanding episodes in this season than any since. It also introduces us to all of the characters till the end of the season 4 specials, plus Torchwood Season 1 and 2 and Torchwood: Children of Earth. In fact if you were to watch it all in proper order you would watch Doctor Who through season 3 episode &#34;Blink&#34;, then watch all of season 1 of Torchwood, then resume Season 3 of Doctor Who.<br />All Seasons of Doctor Who have great episodes, just not as many in my opinion as season 1. It is also not about crazy space creatures, though there are plenty of them. It is still the best show in the history of television
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book from page one. It is simply written but never lacks in content. I'm also so glad to see that this book shines much needed light into the mind of the mentally ill. The bonds of friends, family, and love are stronger than ever. This story also proves that regardless of how painful life can be, there can always be a silver lining.
B00AATV046|5.0|Just the very best ever Christmas movie. Made by stars who were real stars and solid movie makers of the past. Seamless, charming cinema!
B009ETEEAU|5.0|The shipping was fast and the camera works well. It does not come with an auto suction mount though like the blurfix, but that camera broke within 5 mins of use. I rigged this up with a go pro mount and it works great. Took it to the racetrack and got a lot of good footage. For the price this is a solid piece of hardware.
0439023491|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who was reading the series.  Often parts of a series are had to find in local stores.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|sweet game but it seems to stick a bit on login using kindle. it sticks on main screen. I do not have this issue with any other games so far.
0439023513|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who was reading the series.  Often parts of a series are hard to find in local stores.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I love this show, and was very happy to find all four seasons for a good price! Just love it!
B008JFUN8C|1.0|Within the first 30 minutes of the film I thought I was watching another sequel or an imitation of the Chronicles of Narnia. Though some of the characters were interesting I found Great and Powerful Oz to be very un-original. James Franco's character is to Oz what the children were to Narnia in the Chronicles of Narnia. There is a prophecy....A chosen one foretold to come and save Oz from a witch....My wife and I saw it without the kids and glad we did because this movie is very suspensful and what I would call downright wicked at times with regard to the wicked witch played by Mila Kunis. There was a woman in the theater with small children who had to leave the theatre at one point because the scenes were very scary for the children she brought in the 5 to 6 yr old range. There were scenes that moments after I heard multiple children crying in the theater.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Everything is there as explained on the description. The poster is folded.. not so impressive, but as a fan of Michael Jackson, good thing to have as a collection
B004EWFV9K|2.0|Mankell seems tired of this character, & is happy to be ending the series. The book for me was dull,slow,story line not at all engageing like his others. could pass on this one easily.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I did find it very hard to follow- especially very early in the book. I found it difficult at times to see the allegories.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The author heats up Britain's Cold War with an unlikely spy and her literary lover, while keeping the reader intrigued by new twists and turns.  Deliciously good ending.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Well written in the first person. I did not always agree with some of the conclusions. I felt the ending was not quite developed.
B0093ST02E|3.0|I'm in the camp with those who were disappointed by the struggling plot for this movie. At best it was weak and thein sags & bags in swimming pool shower scene downright repulsive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Don't much like the pussy Glen has become but still in love with the Farmers Daughter...
B00BUVLQNI|5.0|Just finished watching, just awesome, this version includes the Christmas Special from the Highlands, which was great.  Cast, scenery, script, all are top notch.<br /><br />Last version did not include the Christmas special, I'm glad the producers were nice enough to add it on this set!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very entertaining and informational on the care of horses. Teaches how to take care of and train the horses so they obey.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|No way this was as good as The Killing Floor. I think the most gaping flaw was the supporting characters did not grab you. They weren't compelling enough for the reader to  really care if they lived or died which resulted in less investment emotionally in the final outcome.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game makes the kids laugh like crazy and they love the options option! They play it continually. Can't get them off it!
1616550414|5.0|This book with its definitive account of the ordering of the Zelda series and pieces of concept art is a great item for any Zelda fan.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This closing chapter in these series of books was fantastic. I had a hard time putting it down. Well written, enjoyed both points of view, and loved the ending.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The book is about a girl from a rough life that falls for a boy from the wrong side of things.  They go through a lot together and struggle to be either together or apart.  Abby can not make up her mind if she should be with the 'bad boy' fighter or stay away.  Her mind says to run but her heart says to stay.  The book is intended for older readers based on the scenerio's.  The book has many different emotions and a lot of love and heart ache.  couldn't put it down!
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT foray into the beautiful world of global film. But the comments about Cousins' accent are merely a reflection of an uneducated American public. Who says that any accent is \\"correct.\\" Such is not feasible.<br /><br />However, I get it, y'all (that was intentional). I was initially put off, like many people, by his accent and had to think about my response.  Then I realized that other English-speaking dialects create a different sense of what the narrator is saying and Cousins is no accepttion. I thought he was hyberbolicaly arrogant until I listened enough to realize that his brogue is merely his brogue, just like any region of America or any English speaking country. And, most importantly, I realized that the series is decidely a personal, passionate love letter to cinema, with no attempt to represent an historical compendium. Resistance to his voice actually illuminates the profundity of his point of view: the world is made up of different voices, experiences, and realities, with far more voices located outside of the contiguous USA. I am disheartened at our reluctance to give \\"different\\" people, narrators a chance. It is very human, and at the same time, very perplexing.<br /><br />BEST SERIES I'VE SEEN IN DECADES! Kudos to Cousins.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I don't rate much, but since this game is better than most I felt obligated to leave a review. nice calm music and nice small goals to pass the time
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Even though this game is pretty easy.... every time you beat it you unlock something. At least so far for me. It's addicting.<br />I like to play right before bed ...and who doesn't take it to the bathroom with them. :-P  I purchased it for .99.  Fun game.
1451695195|3.0|Not a lot of details about the spiritual side of this mans journey.  Mostly about this thought process and thoughts.  Just an OK read.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|amazing mouse, feels great, easy to setup and just all around amazing. If you're thinking about buying it, definatly get it
B003SNKBXW|4.0|Great read. Read this because of the movie the 9th Gate starring Johnny Depp. Loved thr movie so much I decided to checc out the source material
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Book you can't put down. Inspiring book of courage and romance--brings the reader in without wanting to put  book down.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|What more can I say this is an absolute classic and I am glad to finally have this on blu-ray
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great app! I'f you like jetpack joyride and/or \\"running games\\" this is the game for you! Very addicting don't read this when you can be getting subway surfers!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Phil Collins has a very distinctive voice that is wonderful to listen to. This CD has all of his staple songs for all the Genesis fans as well. Great CD!
B008E374PO|3.0|I like it now that I've given it several listens, but I don't know if I like it as much as any of his earlier works, which admittedly have a more electronic feel to them.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is a very good read.  The book was a bit depressing, but quite a page turner, especially at the end.<br />I highly recommend the book.
141694737X|5.0|I like all the animals in the book, and the non standard descriptions of the animals (the lion is too fierce to have as a pet, the camel too grumpy).<br />Sort of weird that the zoo is sending all these animals, but hey... ;-)<br />My 19 month old requests this one at least 4-6 times a week.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Sledge did a great job in relating the horrific day to day events in two major campaigns that he as a Marine private endured and miraculously lived through.  A book hard to put down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I actually. got this game for my dad and his Kindle! It has become one of my favorites in no time at all.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is an excellent family movie! Pay attention to the ending for the symbols of the animals. Worthy of the Oscar nomination.
B00030DEQE|4.0|Updated an older machine to my liking. Down load and upload speeds increased very much.Thank you. Will use this outlet again when needed.
034580404X|5.0|Love it, so did both of my daughter. We can't wait for the movie. A must read for any woman.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|We love the Skorpions & have the Roger Waters &#34;The Wall&#34; with them on it too.This DVD which is basically their 'unplugged' is just &#34;phenomenal&#34;.Great show some old & some new ,but everyone a winner.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|A welcome change to myriad of rubbish out there. Simple yet fun and quite addictive. Well written. Great quality software.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|My wife is a big fan of Andrea so I bought this for her as a Valentines Day gift.Naturally she liked the gift & the songs too,but thinks that it is not one of his better efforts.
B0086700CM|5.0|This was difficult toplay until I used the tutorial.  After that it was great fun.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
B0093LFENA|4.0|I'll bet some of you American readers had no idea Robbie Williams even had a new album out. Since November! Because sadly the US record companies neglect to put out his albums here in the states. Such a shame. In fact, if I recall the last of his albums to be released here was 2000′s Sing When You're Winning. That was \\"Rock DJ\\". That was many moons (and albums) ago.<br />Take the Crown is Robbie's first album since after his stellar career retrospective In and Out of Consciousness in 2010. It's his first collaboration with producer Jacknife Lee, and the team-up proves to bring some fresh ideas to Robbie's sound.<br />We start out with \\"Be A Boy\\", a big ambitious middle finger to everyone that ever wished his career and fame to be over. The melody soars and is instantly catchy as he muses \\"They said it was leaving.. they said it with joy\\". The second track \\"Gospel\\" rocks out a bit and I can't help but notice that Williams sounds a tad bit like Art Alexakis from Everclear. Mix that with a British singer and it's something all new. Here he looks back and recalls first love.<br />Next up is the standout, \\"Candy\\", already having been a big hit in the UK. This is a new style for Robbie, mixing in horns, strings and recalling somewhat of a sunshiny Motown sound. He makes what is almost a self-help song about an insecure unhappy girl into a big joyful noise. And then for something completely \\"Different\\". This song is more of a heavy ballad, or more an apology song. It leaves you wondering if the narrator of the song is sincere or just saying what he wants the woman to hear to take him back. The video even leaves this with an unsettling answer. This is one of the qualities that I believe makes Mr. Williams last. He writes songs that are essentially pop, but he interjects wit and a few twists to see if you're paying attention.<br />Next we have an upbeat guitars and four-on-the-floor beat track called \\"S*** On the Radio\\" that has a very similar feel to Jessie J's \\"Domino\\" at first and lands somewhere in 80′s new-wavy pop retro. I'm sure this was intentional. The song is part pick-up line and part social commentary. Then right after we veer into a darker dance groove for \\"All That I Want\\", where Robbie confesses his sinister plan to \\"pick you up from out of that dress, carry you to that desk, and feel the sin out of that flesh\\". This one is perfect for the clubs and all dark sleazy places.<br />Then we get Robbie the crooner on \\"Hunting For You\\", going for a more acoustic rock vibe. \\"Into The Silence\\" is obviously a bit informed by all the great jangly guitar U2 songs. At first you think with the crooning this is a ballad. Until he sings \\"When karma reaches you I want to be there to catch that fall, get down beside you and watch you crawl\\". Possibly one of the most bitter breakup songs I've heard. Especially when the beauty of the underlying layers of musicianship and strings completely contrast the lyrics. It's one big kiss-off with an evil grin. definitely one of the best on the collection.<br />\\"Hey Wow Yeah Yeah\\" is sort of a stab at alternative indie-rock. Absolutely no point, just \\"Boy boy boy girl girl clap your hands\\" and lots of crowd conjuring lyrics. You can tell though by this point it's all completely tongue-in-cheek, showing how easy it is to write a catchy song without any kind of meaningful words. And it's kind of irresistible, which drives the point home. Then back to reality we have \\"Not Like The Others\\", a hard rocker about some really great sex. \\"When she comes, she comes for hours, stun! She don't fake for no one\\". Oddly with Robbie's cheeky delivery this comes off as a love song. Then the big finale is an acoustic folk-based duet with female vocalist Lissie called \\"Losers\\". This is a big heartfelt statement about coming of age and realizing that all of the chase of popularity and material happiness is a big waste of time, \\"So let's stop the competition now, or we will both be losers\\". Quite a grand way to finish.<br />The deluxe edition gives a couple more tracks. First is \\"Reverse\\", a big \\"put your hand in my hand\\" anthemic song that has no place being merely a bonus track. \\"Eight Letters\\" is a gentle piano ballad about life's lessons, and is the demo version of a track recorded in the reunion of his former 90′s \\"boy band\\" Take That.<br />It's really a crime that a number one British album isn't even bothered with here in the states. I found out about the album because of Robbie's appearance on the Graham Norton show. I could tell as he performed \\"Candy\\", and the crowd quite literally ate it up, that I was missing something. How have I not heard this song? Sometimes I really am ashamed of the US audiences' bland palette and refusal to try things that aren't already on the radio. This is quite a good album, full of catchy pop but also good songwriting. Thank goodness for internet resellers making it easy to obtain a copy.ves a couple more tracks.

B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Ever since I saw Dave Grohl, legendary Foo Fighters frontman and drummer for Nirvana once upon a time, talking about his new film that he directed, I was intrigued. Grohl has such a great personality and I could imagine him making a great documentary. Especially after seeing the Back & Forth documentary about the history of Foo Fighters. It's obvious Dave is a music fanatic to his very core. I want to see his excitement put to use in a film.<br />Sound City Studios existed in Van Nuys, California from 1969 until its closing of its doors in 2011. At that time, Dave Grohl purchased the custom Neve 8028 Console from the main Studio A, to have installed in his own home studio, 606 Studio. This documentary is a love letter to all of the music that was recorded in that time using this studio and this console. This weaves together a timeline that starts with how Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks met a lost directionless Fleetwood Mac through the people of this studio. It follows with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Rick Springfield, as much of their early popularity came from recordings and situations that happened around Sound City Studios. The story then takes us through the 80s and the battle between analog and digital studios, and gives us a glimpse of how early digital recording worked. Despite its popularity, many artists still chose to record in analog.<br />The next chapter is the part dear to Dave Grohl. Nirvana recorded their album Nevermind at Sound City. The album and experience not only changed the band forever, but brought new life back to the studio. This prompted 90s artists like Rage Against the Machine to also record here. But as the story winds down to a sad ending, digital recording became the norm. people can now make albums in their bedrooms on a laptop. Sound City just couldn't compete enough to stay in business.<br />But the sad ending takes a happy twist. Dave Grohl bought the Neve console, the heart of the sound in the studio, and had it moved to his own 606 Studio. Wanting to start a new chapter to the story, Grohl invited many people to his studio to collaborate on new music. Not all of the music on this album, entitled Sound City: Real to Reel is covered in the film. But we see the spark of what happens when artists collaborate. Grohl records some really lively and energetic music with Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, members of Fear and Kyuss, historic session players, and then the big cherry on top. All of the surviving members of Nirvana record a song with Paul McCartney. Not only is the song really good, but watching someone create music out of the spontaneity of being in a room with one of their idols is an inspiring thing to see.<br />I also intend to give a full listen to the album that came from these sessions and review it separately. However, I wanted to see the film first to have a context of the music. This is an extremely well put together film, and it really gets across why it is important not to lose the human element of music creation in an increasingly digital world. Even when speaking about Trent Reznor, who uses all kinds of digital electronics in his music, the point is made clear about how important it is to have skill and emotion as a solid foundation so that the tools are tools but not crutches. I definitely have to commend Dave Grohl on such a wonderful job making this film. It's fun to watch a documentary when the maker of the film has a real passion for the subject like Grohl does here.ed to his own 606 Studio.

B001FB55HQ|1.0|The dvd was not stuck in its place so it moved around inside the case and got all scratched up and the case is damaged.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game captivated me quickly with nice eye candy, music and challenging play.<br />I don't know what else to say.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book carries an extensive plot. Lots of interesting twists and turns. Not as hot and spicy as book number one but definitely had to turn the pages. Fully romantic, dramatic, action packed and mysterious. I liked that the author didn't re tell the story from book one and two. It just continued. You actually have to read those books to keep up. Great read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!! Icould play it all day and night.you can  this for on trains it is so much fun.I think kids and adults should have this game.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Sanderson does a great job at writing a story that is engaging both emotionally and intellectually.  Well worth the money
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hate scary movies, or slash and bloody gore movies. This show is keeps you on the edge of your seat, and I find my self cheering the group on. Yes it has a lot of gore but it seems more like something that really could happen and less for the effect of showing blood and gore. Like the traffic accident, everyone has to slow down and look even though you don't want to....
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Packaging was good and discs came in great shape and on time. Of course movie beautiful as expected!! Kids enjoyed it!
B009YQJ322|5.0|Quick to ship and was as described. I will do business with them again for sure in the future. Nice
0385349947|2.0|Nothing new here in the genre but the author. The book isn't a good read, as in it doesn't hold you in the way a manifesto should. Too little about Ms. Sandberg's personally struggles, compromises, false starts, and obvious great triumphs. Basically, thin soup that also offers no new insights on working women, full time working mothers, and women in power. Ironically, from what I surmise, this book is the author's first gambit in creating a more fruitful, balanced life outside corporate America - i.e. public intellectual - exactly the type of bailing out of a powerful corporate career this book purports to oppose. I would have given it one star frankly but in the end you got to admire the chutzpah. My money's on Sheryl.

B001E25MBK|5.0|Contains all three Godfather movies plus a bonus disc with trailers, interviews, how they restored the film, family history etc. The restoration is magnificent and really brings out the true intentions of the director. Highly recommend for any movie buff or Godfather fan.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|First hand account of warfare that seems like fiction but is true. Chronicles the emotional tug of war between service and civilian life. R.I.P. Chris. Thank you.
0470913029|5.0|Recommended by a friend, this book opened my eyes to the realities of how poorly I have been eating for decades. Also known as the &#34;caveman diet&#34;, Paleo is a different way of thinking how to eat, and eat healthy. This book covers how we as a race have shifted away from the natural foods that we were designed to eat over to grains and processed foods. It also discusses Omega 6 to 3 fat ratio and diseases of civilization. The book includes a section on how to make Paleo work for you, which I found interesting. There are also discussions about which foods to eat and avoid. I also found the Paleo diet Users Manual very helpful and the meal plans included in this book got me off to a running start. The book also include recipes and exercise advice. I have been doing Paleo about 80-90% for over six months, and I feel and look great. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their lifestyle through common sense eating.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Loooooooooooooooove it. Good game. Fun, addicting, and entertaining. MY NEW FAVORITE GAME. If you like horses get this game. Seriously.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's the the best since angry birds Rio and graphics are amazing and the shark can move very very fast
B0015F1VY8|5.0|I chose this film vs the other \\"Elizabeth\\" because of the PG 13 rating on this.  I wanted to be able to show my homeschooler this, as we just finished reading about the Elizabethan Age in History.  (He ended up not liking it. I absolutely loved it, as did my husband.)<br />Action, intrigue, excellent acting, incredibly beautiful sets, camera shots, lighting, etc....  If i could improve the movie, I would have made it a tad more clear as far as the plot, (i.e. WHY was Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots in \\"jail\\" in the first place?) but if you can  bear not quite understanding everything, it was fabulous.  Love, adventure, etc.... Just beware of some particulary gory scenes,<br />as torture was commonplace in those days.  Definite parental discretion advised on that.  Also a vague sexual scene, although there was no nudity.  Also great for fans of ocean movies: great scenes at the end, of adventurous boating and war as the Spanish Armada attacked Enland.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I have been interested in the politcal scene since my military days , 50 years or so ago.<br />Assumng a degree of accuracy, I find this a really great read without an obvious slant as i the case in so may books which claim to be the facts, so to speak.<br />A must read for anyone who is intrigued by the Presidential stage.
B003YNFYD8|3.0|Have the Red one and soon will have the Blue one.  Makes a nice birthday present and you can't go wrong with the Beatles.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a fun, simple game to play.  I'm comfortable letting my kids play it and I enjoy it as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got to the last page, and I wanted more. I felt left hanging in the wind. So, I rolled my eyes and hope book 2 will pick up where this one leaves off.
B003UBTX6S|1.0|This is not a review of the book.  It is to alert other potential purchasers of the Kindle version that the text-to-speech feature will NOT work with this title.<br /><br />I guess the publisher wants you to also buy the audio book.  Three cheers for corporate greed!!!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Video playback was jittery and audio was like hiccups.<br />I troubleshot my video streaming device and internet<br />Connection before I wrote this review. It seems out of<br />10 movies I watch, 3 of them have poor quality playback<br />only at amazon this appears to happen not sure if it's a<br />glitch in their server or what. I will continue to<br />Purchase from them I'll just have to watch the movie twice.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|Same Time Next Year is a very romantic story of an enduring love which has taken two people through years in which they were sometimes out of sync with one another. It shows a strong sharing in each other's lives. The only problem is that they are married to someone else at the time. The theme song is beautiful.Pictures of historic events between the episodes are nostalgic and help the viewer keep the historic time frames in perspective.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is ok but it takes you along time to get points it was fun too over all I love it&iexcl;!!!!!!!!'!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I really loved this book, and I'm a seventeen year old guy! That should say something. If you can respect a good love story then this is the perfect book for you. Due to its time period, some of the words used may need to be looked up, and that's why I would recommend this book for high school level readers. Great read!!!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Reminds me of early Amy Winehouse.  Gritty and soulful yet not as commercial sounding as 21 has become.  Great album.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It won't work because it will always say that i need to connect to the internet when i am connected.
1616550414|5.0|Awesome book &#60;3 a good addition to every The Legend Of Zelda fan collection. I love reading this, and its a great reference to understand the series.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I would tell people to get it because there is a lot you can do with it and you can talk to famous people
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Reading Chris's story in the context of his death in no way detracts from the power of his words and stories, but it amplifies the sense of loss and waste at his tragic murder. An amazing self-portrait of a man who retained his basic values in the face of inhuman situations.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|There is only a few swords that you get and there to easy to get. They need to add more swords so it will be better.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Similar to other long term Bowie fans, regardless of the pre-release hype, I was anxious to get this CD as quickly as possible.  If I compare it to the 1st Bowie album I bought, Diamond Dogs, it's nothing like that album nor era. In some ways, I still yearn for the Ziggy & Aladdin daze!  Bowie's influence has also turned me onto other great bands like Bauhaus, Eno, Gary Numan, Marc Bolan, the Psychedelic Furs, Roxy Music, Jay Division, Ultravox, Mott the Hoople, Icehouse,... so I thank him by keeping current with his latest releases. I'm glad he's still recording; I imagine that he will \\"go on tour\\" via one performance on a Pay-Per-View Concert feed ~ this would be right up his alley (e.g. the 1980 Floor Show only 40 yrs later ~ it was shot in 1973).  The CD is growing on me and listening to Bowie brings alot of good memories back so thanks for the release!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's like the hipster version of temple run. It's very entertaining, and I'd play it all day if I could.

B001AP11L6|5.0|Starts out fantastic with Seven Nation Army (hard to get this out of your head for the rest of the day).  I really loved It's A Cold, Cold Night.  Really, I enjoyed all of it, and recommend highly.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|we this flick in our collection it just one of those movies that you can just watch over and over
B00B23O96A|2.0|With the possible exception of Gotta Get Over this is truly a coma inducing effort by EC. This has nursing home elevator music written all over it. I suppose in 20 years someone will remaster this piece of recycled garbage and add a half dozen bonus tracks, demo versions or other session outtakes. Not then, not now. It is so over, Eric. Show yourself to the door.
B00389XV42|4.0|All of the seasons blend together a little for me, so I am not reviewing each season, but the overall series.  Chuck was a great show from start to finish.  I started season 1 after the final season was complete, and watched all seasons over the course of a couple months.  It was a great way to do it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|awesome features and sounds. love the fact you can choose your snooze options and wake up call noises. for kindle.
B00442OI1C|4.0|What can I say.  I was hooked on Chuck since episode 1 season 1.  Its corny.  Its immature.  Its action packed, and it has Sara.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is the best game ever invented in the amazon app store and in the whole United States and in the whole world and in the whole galexy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just a great story based on a fascinating premise. So excited to start reading book 6. Thanks Mr Howey for the terrific read.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I find this site almost as good as the one on my large screen<br />computer. It's great for checking up on recent bids.
B0032Y0OH0|5.0|Pretty awesome for video editing - though I wish I would have bought the pro version for the extra buttons.<br /><br />One great thing about it is the software to configure it.<br />you basically assign keystrokes to each button and then for the wheel, there are many well thought out event triggers.<br />The settings are per app so you can have different keys depending on what app is active.<br /><br />Overall a great value and a must have for any video editor!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|First thing I check every morning. Gives me exactly what I want<br />from a weather site.. and seems to be the most accurate of them<br />all.

B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the Mystery Manor game. This is one of my favorite hidden objects games.<br />So keep this kind of game coming.
1407499238|4.0|A nice change and different storyline, characters and setting. Not the typical virgin in her teen years, or the arrogant millionaire whom change later for the better. it is a story of hope and despair, where time is the variable critical factor in the lives of the protagonists.<br /><br />A story told and filmed previously on several occasions, as \\"The Sea Inside\\" with Javier Bardem, excellent and very similar.<br /><br />I could not put the book down. I felt Lou's hope and will to save Will, but I also empathized with Will's struggles and feelings and lose battles, and even acknowledging the denouement, I was still hoping for the better.<br /><br />The writing was very much desirable and the narrators of this audio book SURPRINSINGLY BUT TRUE...were GREAT.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This is a good game. Although I wish the zoom was a tad bigger.Other than that it is a good game.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love it. It is rare were all the music is good. Makes me want to dance and sing.Even my husband likes it.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Have been an Eagles fan for a very long time and Joe Walsh,sort of the middle of the road,in terms of his solo music...Have his greatest hits and this is his first solo album I bought.Heard around 3 songs via radio,etc and knew I had to pick this up.Just solid throughout.No weak songs to me that carry the album straight through.Perhaps I will look into his older catalogue now,of albums.If you're a fan of the Eagles and sort of above casual fan of Joes,this is for you... Buy it now and perhaps,if you're like me,will look back into his older solo albums  Keep rockin'!!!!  Aloha!!!!

B005HSL626|5.0|I like it a lot.  Both my grandchildren 2 & 4 and my 94 year old mother can play it as can I.  I like the fact that it has choices such as the arcade version.  We play it together which makes it even better.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The special appearances at the end make this worth the purchase price plus you get a great live performance as well.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Found it difficult to play and couldn't find directions in how to play it.  Also, appears that you had to be online to play.  Not what I was looking for.
B00860YICC|5.0|I am surprised more people haven't seen it. I liked the competition with Jelly Roll best. I would recommend it to anyone older than 20.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked this book, I chose this rating because it is No 50 shades BUT, It will defiantly do. Thanks
B0013KTGAG|5.0|It is so awesome when you find a great sci-fi movie. I loved it. It truly makes me want to watch it again. That rarely happens.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Good plot sequel to Bourne Identity. I personally like Supremacy and Identity better because of their plot/ story line more so than Ultimatium.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the most thought provoking, insightful and well written books I've ever read. I could just read it over and over again.
B00130UFY2|4.0|I didn't like this movie as much as Identity or Supremacy, The plot is not as good and can be reduced to simply &#34;Bourne gets even&#34;. But since you can't just have the first two without the ending I bought Ultimatium. Besides my husband likes all three.

B008YKGQR4|4.0|My only complaint is that it doesn't &#34;delete&#34; old messages on private threads, so I have to scroll down forever to get to a current message.  Maybe I need to play around with it a little bit more.  otherwise, it is great!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a dark new world that provide a very interesting setting for sci-ci histories. Here humanity is reduce to life inside a big underground building - a silo. Outside, the word is toxic and complete devoid of life. Inside, political control and social pressures warrant many trilling histories in the years to come.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park is a quiet, heavily romantic story of first love - perfect for any hopeless romantic. Told through the POVs of both Park and Eleanor, it was a beautiful story, with so many passages that immediately made their way onto my favorite quotes list. If words were edible, Rowell's writing would be my favorite kind of chocolate, and it would've been long gone.<br /><br />Eleanor is curvy, and wears rather different clothing from everyone else. Park is part Korean, someone you don't generally see in YA novels, and is quiet, and strives to blend in and go un-noticed rather than stand out. Their story isn't perfect, and while Park's life might seem near so, Eleanor has family problems at home, and is bullied by the people at her school. Park tries to protect her; Eleanor tries to protect herself. Armed with comic books and soundtracks from the '80s, Eleanor & Park tells a story that's impossibly cute and fuzzy-feeling-evoking at times, and messy and delicate at others.<br /><br />I loved our main characters, and a bus ride that turned into so much more. They were a very dynamic couple, and definitely one I found myself rooting for. Theirs is a somewhat simple story with so much depth, managing to squeeze in both serious moments, moments of hurt, and moments filled with warm and fuzzy feelings. There were times when such moments got too warm and fuzzy, and/or when Park said things that I really don't feel a teenage boy would say. Not even in sappy love poetry, like the type I found scribbled under my school's bleachers one day (of the soul-deep, dramatic, even-I'm-feeling-embarrassed-for-the-author kind). While I loved the story overall, there were times where I wondered if Park was really a high-school student, or someone much, much older. And, in some cases, much more girly.<br /><br />But that was my one and only con. I especially loved the way the author wrapped up the story, and the open-ended-ness of the ending, as bittersweet as it was. The characters were enjoyable, the scenes were wonderfully balanced out, and the writing was, for the most part, beautiful. I did flip through the story again later on and find some places that were too adjective and adverb-heavy, or where certain sentences didn't match up, but I'm sure (and hoping) that those little issues will be fixed before Eleanor & Park's official publication.<br /><br />--<br />abbreviated.<br /><br />PROS: Beautiful writing; characters that really stand out.<br /><br />CONS: Sometimes, it got really cheesy, and things Park did and said to Eleanor didn't seem like things a teenage boy would do/say.<br /><br />OVERALL: Though cheesy at times, Eleanor & Park was a wonderfully written love story and one hopeless romantics would devour.

B00AFEYUVG|4.0|The book is always better than the movie, but the movie should've followed more of the book scenes.  It's still a good movie and I recommend it.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|I Love The Eagles music. All of it. Rich in melody, texture, and those harmonies. I have watched The History now (on cable) several times...NOT for the interviews, but because behind the three hours of BIASED History as spoken by self proclaimed Leader of The band-Glenn Frey...the damn music playing is so great you cant skip ahead. Its ALL good music. That's one thing  that survives this incredibly one sided \\"history\\". It starts off with a very rare home video of Don and Glenn riding in a Limo where an obviously substance enhanced Henley exchange some private moments. This program is filled with never before seen video of the band in rehearsals and live on stage. Unfortunately NO SONG IS COMPLETE. Not ONE. The program runs over 3 hours--they could have left a couple songs UNCUT. It';s frustrating because unlike other bands who regularly appear on talk shows or televised concerts,. The Eagles have always remained a very limited TV exposure band. During their height of popularity , in the last tour 1979-1980 there is NO concert footage. I was told they filmed the 1980 tour-but alas there is no live footage shown. What is here?  Many ultra-rare (kept in someones vault for years) clips.<br /><br />Glenn Frey, Henley, and ALL The Eagles are interviewed -or rather giving their renditions of how events unfolded. Glenn Frey comes off as being totally candid, honest, brutally comitted to being in charge, making no apologies, and satisfied. OTOH--The Don Henley segments are tight lipped. Henley is always aware of what he speaks and we get no real insight into how they composed songs, The PROCESS of creation. Henley doesnt speak a word about where the songs came from, not a word about his antics with the Eagles partying days. Come on Henley-give us some \\"DIRTY LAUNDRY\\".  No talk of girls, drugs, bad blood. He's tight lipped as hell. Walsh gives us all he can remember bless his loving soul. Timothy Schmidt doesn't have that much to offer but seems like a very easy going personable guy. Even original members Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner agree to be interviewed as well as JD SOUTHER, JACKSON BROWNE among others.<br /><br />The STRANGE--DON FELDER actually appears in this show and comes off as a very confused man. Leadon left because the Eagles were leaving Country rock. Randy Miesner left because he just wasnt willing to SING his best composition \\"Take it To The Limit\\" because he was \\"SHY\\" (he admits it). If you are not going to sing your best or most famous song--is there really a point to staying in the band? Glenn frey, as arrogant and egocentric as some claim-happens to be RIGHT in almost all of his views on why members were 'let go\\".  It seems Felder and Frey were never in tune mentally--Glenn and Henley were the leaders--the main songwriters and singers--Felder had th attitude \\"we are all ONE, we should all get paid the same, sing an equal amount of songs and all share the same band revenue\\". He seems to be the only one in the band who shares that feeling. What's strange is after being fired a SECOND time in 1999 because Frey claims \\"Felder was more concerned about how much money I was making than what he was making\\". He called Felders agent and said \\"Barry, Im sorry you happen to represent the only A****LE in the band, but either he signs the contract by tonight or we are replacing Don Felder\\". Obvously Felder's views that they were all EQUALS doesnt match Frey's view, Henley's view or their manager Irving Azoff.  Watching Felder almos cry admitting he misses those guys-after all of this--is strange. Even stranger--DAVID GEFFEN, Music Mogul, agrees to be interviewed. After all the Bitching between Felder, Frey, Leadon and Frey, -Geffen has the simple minded view that \\"Henley has always been a malcontent\\". If by malcontent, Mr Geffen means a man who won't have his publishing stolen, his life owned, his song choices chosen, and his media schedule dictated..then I think Henley should proud of the title \\"malcontent\\".<br /><br />It isa very engaging documentary with tons of rare and never before seen backstage, on stage and off stage film clips. Still it is lacking in vintage interviews as The Eagles didnt DO any TV interviews back inthe 70's.  Frey and Henley do NOT discuss their lack of participation in interviews, Tv shows. For my part , and I LOVE Henley and respect him as a songwriter and artist-his part of this documentary is most lacking-in everything. He talks a LITTLE bit about HOTEL CALIFORNIA but not from an inspirational point of view. Only from a 'what the song means to many people\\" aspect. A lot less revealing than telling us what he was thinking, who inspires the song. Hel, he doesn;t even discuss what specific Hotel he was staying at when he wrote the main lyrics.<br /><br /> It is Frey who makes this film work--I have gained a great deal of respect for him watching this.  He holds nothing back! He tells it like it is, he's not hiding or insincere.  He seems to be the most level headed, composed,  both artist and businessman. He knew what riffs would make a hit song, reveals where he got the title for \\"Life In the fast Lane\\" He was the inspiration for their early important hits,  he tried to do what was best as JOE WALSH says \\"For the Eagles\\". That meant-in one excrutiatingly uncomfortable scene--having Irving Azoff take Felder to dinner (The other Eagles too chicken s..t to tell Felder to his face) to inform him-he will NOT be singing VICTIM OF LOVE_-it will be Henley. Henley has a different memory of the song that Felder claims he wrote. Henley- \\"It didnt come to us as one complete song-just a guitar riff, I, Glenn and JD souther constructed the song-we let Mr Felder sing the song, over and over, it just didnt come up to band standards\\" . And that is the issue=--Didnt Felder understand--Henley and Frey were always the one's making the decisions. To this day i dont think he gets it. Seeing unrecognizabe versions of Meisner today  and a bald Leadon (his afro was his known trademark)..also strange. But the  music is so great throughout this you wont even pay attention to the infighting interviews. No matter what you think about Frey or Henley it is the amazing catalog of great songs that will always be remembered.  BTW-The Eagles may be the best selling American Band of all time. I'm not sure of that...but Frey and Henley have said so (on 60 minutes).

B00BHMETKC|4.0|I was living in Iran as a kid during this time and it wasn't quite the way the movie projected it, particular the airline car-chase at the end.  Canada (Ken Taylor) was a major player in their release, not really emphasized in the movie.  But a good watch all the same.

B0008JIJ2E|4.0|My family watched the Karate Kid movie last night.  They loved it, but the ending was shorter and seemed like the ending had been edited.  We were all very disappointed, since the original ending has the sensei of the cobras challenge Mr. Miyagi to a fight.  I would have given the movie 5 stars if the original ending was in the movie not cut out of it.  No one mentioned this when I bought this movie.  Special Edition should be changed to Ending Changed Edition!

B008I3RARW|1.0|See.... this game looked promising until i went to open it and the screen would not choose which way to go. If i turned it sideways it would turn the opposite sideway. When i first started to play the game it would not work correctly.

B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This is one of the most difficult movies I've had to review in a long time.<br />Why?<br />Because almost everything I've read has been positive and yet every review has had a much different take on the overall meaning of the film.<br />I was expecting a spiritual rebirth for myself somewhat.<br />Unrealistic yes, but that is the kind of praise that's been heaped on this film.<br />I was expecting a movie that was life changing.<br />Well...it wasn't.<br />I didn't get either of those things and yet I don't feel cheated either.<br />And that is the real magic of this film...that everyone will take away something different.<br />Me?<br />I took away a real sense of sorrow and yet I took away an almost calm feeling. I type this with a somewhat mischievous grin on my face because that is another strange feeling that this film gave me.<br />This isn't just a film about a boy lost at sea.<br />It's a film about feelings and how we react to certain situations.<br />It is a film I will revisit many times over the years<br />It is...a difficult but successful movie that will make you ponder the meaning of many things.<br />Brilliant direction.<br />Score, FX, 3D...pretty much everything is absolute perfection.<br />Watch it just once with an open mind.<br />Some will love it, some will hate it, some will never understand it and most of us will take away something different from it than anyone else.<br />And that is the real magic of this film.<br />Very difficult but very rewarding.<br />Recommended.

0060555661|4.0|I am new to value investing.  No, I'm not a large institutional investor with goo gobs of money to burn.  But I find this book amazing and intriguing at the same time as it is obviously old and dated but has some very interesting points applicable to today.  It talks about growth stocks and IPO's and how you really shouldn't invest at all or heavily in these issues.  You have to be smart enough to read this back and dissect what's still applicable to our modern times.  I call it the Value Investor's Bible because just like the Bible, the stories are old but the lesson remains the same.  I won't go into further detail because I could really right a long review on this.<br /><br />So no Value Investor should be without this book.  Think of this a reality pill and ultimate reference guide to navigating your financial future.

0307341550|4.0|I wish I could give \\"Sharp Objects\\" a 4.5, because it was just almost that good!<br /><br />Camille, a young reporter working for a second-tier newspaper in Chicago, is assigned to work a possible serial murder story, which happens to be centered in her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri. Camille would refuse the assignment, but she has yet to prove herself as a competent reporter. While the story sounds intriguing enough, Camille's major hurdle is the fact that she will have to stay with her family. To put it mildly, her mother is cold and punishing, her step-father is weak and pitiful, and her little sister is wild and strange. Doggedly, Camille tries her hardest to track down enough facts to write a couple of stories so she can just get out of town, but, of course, no one wants to give her anything.<br /><br />Although there are a few twists and turns, I felt like I could see the general ending a mile away, and I kind of felt the characters were predictable and almost...flat. Still, I did stay up reading three hours past my usual falling-asleep time, as Gillian Flynn has a way of capturing her readers and making them hang on for dear life. Another disturbing, yet masterful, book from Flynn.

B000MHXPZ8|3.0|\\"Sleuth\\" (1972) starring Lord Laurence Olivier (1907 - 1989) and Sir Michael Caine (1933 - ), directed by Joseph Mankiewicz (1909 - 1993) is a 2 man \\"tour de force\\" stage play presented on film, shot mostly at a famous English restored 15th century manor house mansion called \\"Athelhampton Hall,\\" owned in 1972 by Joseph Cooke, then a member of the UK Parliament.<br /><br />Here are details about Athelhampton Hall in England (comments about the \\"Sleuth\\" movie follow).............<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />The hall is a Grade I listed 15th-century privately owned country house on 160 acres (65 ha) of parkland. It is now open for public visits.<br /><br />An internet \\"virtual tour\\" is possible by visiting WWW.Athelhampton.Co.Uk/<br /><br />Sir William Martyn had the current Great Hall built in about 1493. A West Wing and Gatehouse were added in 1550, but in 1862 the Gatehouse was demolished.<br /><br />Sir Robert Long bought Athelhampton House in 1665 from Sir Ralph Bankes. In 1684 an attempt was made by the court to sequester the estate from the then owner, James Long Esquire (son of Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet), to recover a debt, but this seems to have been unsuccessful. The estate passed down through the Long family to William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley (Viscount Wellesley, later 5th Earl of Mornington), who sold it in 1848 to George Wood.<br /><br />In 1891, the house was acquired by the antiquarian Alfred de Lafontaine, who carried out restoration to the interior and added the North Wing in 1920-21.<br /><br />At the same time de Lafontaine engaged Inigo Thomas to create one of England's great gardens as a series of \\"outdoor rooms\\" inspired by the Renaissance. 20 acres (8.1 ha) of formal gardens are encircled by the River Piddle, and consist of eight walled gardens with numerous fountains and pavilions, plus a balustraded terrace, statues, obelisks and vistas through gate piers. Great Court contains 12 giant yew pyramids set around the pool by the great terrace.<br /><br />The lawn to the west has an early 16th-century circular dovecote, and the south terrace features a vast Magnolia grandiflora and a Banksian rose. Pear trees cover the old walls and support roses and Clematis.<br /><br />Athelhampton has been owned by three generations of the Cooke family, the present owners.  It was the setting for the 1972 film \\"Sleuth\\".<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />The movie lasts almost 2 1/2 hours and is hard to watch and get enthusiastic about in spite of the very good actor work of the two movie stars who are the only actors seen in the movie.<br /><br />The lovely \\"Athelhampton Hall\\" setting is sort of the \\"third actor\\" in the show, and is one of the reasons the movie's pacing is slowed down (a small part of the movie was shot in London movie studios, but I would guess less than 10% was).<br /><br />Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine are always worth seeing....they are two of England's best movie actors, and the problem parts of the movie are greatly forgiveable simply because of the good work the two stars provide.<br /><br />That said, there are indeed many \\"problem parts\\" of \\"Sleuth\\" (1972), and the characters presented by the writer are not interesting or sufficiently endearing to justify the long time the viewer is asked to spend with them.<br /><br />It is important to like the stars of any movie, and that includes villains, and people who engage in villainy.<br /><br />Neither of the 2 main (only) characters in \\"Sleuth\\" (1972) is sufficiently likeable to keep viewers interested, regardless of the superb job Olivier and Caine do with what they are given.<br /><br />Laurence Olivier probably owned a large percentage of the movie....Michael Caine was just beginning to act in movies he also owned (\\"Get Carter\\" [1971] was the first movie Caine produced and owned, partly).<br /><br />\\"Sleuth\\" (1972) shows off Olivier's actor talent, which Olivier was no doubt happy with....and since he was theboss of the production, questions about the movie being a big \\"ego trip\\" for Olivier were probably not raised, neither, likely, were objections to the movie's shortcomings....too long, too slow, too obvious, not well written in many ways.<br /><br />What the viewer and movie historian are left with is the fact that \\"Sleuth\\" (1972) is a very important and famous movie starring two of the most important movie actors of the 20th century, and at the same time, it is a mediocre movie in many ways.<br /><br />It is technically and historically interesting, and not more.<br /><br />For people (I am one) interested in \\"stage plays made into movies which remain interesting historical examples of well done stage plays,\\" this movie is worth knowing about and seeing at least once.<br /><br />BTW, stage plays like \\"Sleuth\\" (1972)....a play made into a movie..is arguably an art form which many people agree probably died around 1980....see the excellent documentary titled \\"Broadway: The Golden Age\\" [2004] which presents this view.<br /><br />Any movie which stars Laurence Olivier is important (also true of any movie starring Michael Caine), and therefore, \\"Sleuth\\" (1972) is important......but this doesn't mean it's a good movie.<br /><br />\\"Sleuth\\" (1972) is a bad movie with good qualities and excellent actors.....not the same thing as a good movie, sadly.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Tex (David) Allen is a SAG-AFTRA accredited movie actor.

B000J5XS3C|1.0|Don't waste money buying cheap mixers. Save up and go all out because otherwise you'll make the mistake I made buying this. It doesn't carry all the frequencies of your audio. You have to put the jacks half way in a certain position rather than all the way in. Because of this fault with the product I couldn't use it live. The pre-amps are terrible quality and latency is way off. The aux return is good for effects but there is only one. In conclusion save your money and buy a mixer at about £200 and you won't have to deal with set backs like this.
B005ZUR724|5.0|What I like the most is you can't buy your way through the game. If you want a strong character, you have to start at the basic, and work your way up
B007MCTTHY|5.0|LOVE this game! Played through all levels in three days and had a lot of fun. Wish that they would come out with more!
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I got this to upgrade my Phenom Tri-Core because Black Ops 2 was near unplayable. I have a decent GPU but the game really chews up the CPU and the RAM. I also upgraded from 4GB of ram to 16GB, which I am sure helped. The stock fan sucks on this thing which is a first for me on an AMD processor. I upgraded to a Corsair H60 liquid cooler and it is running like a champ. All together the setup cost me a little over $200. Not bad for a mid range cooler and an 8 core processor. I would for sure buy again, wish I had started with this instead of the 3 core, but this wasn't in my price range until now.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was surprised at every turn of this book! Great read. Can't wait to read the other books she has written

0316056898|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think of Bossypants after I placed Tina Fey's autobio down finished. At first I thought she had hidden behind humour and feminist rantings (which weren't too bad.) Then the more I thought about it, the more I realised I suddenly knew alot more about the lady of comedy than I did before.<br /><br />It must come as no surprise that Fey's biography is presented with witty discourse throughout, but it surprised be how much genuine discloser Fey packed into the pages of Bossy pants; ranging from her childhood, school years, family life and professional television career. The highlight for me was her story of meeting Sylvester Stallone for the first time - probably worth reading just for this scene..<br /><br />In total tho- If you're looking for a humble, intelligent, perhaps slightly shrill biography this is the one for you.
B003G4W49C|2.0|This is an okay book. There is a lot of foul language in this book. This story is about a little boy that has been taken to the Battleschool. Here he learns about The Game, a game that involves null gravity. This boy, Ender, is the most brilliant and very likely the only hope for human kind. The teachers push him into thinking that he is alone. Eventually he is taken to the Command school, where he believes that he is only playing a simulator, when he is really defeating the buggers, the aliens that threaten humanity. In the end he joins his sister on one of the buggers home planets and realizes what they were truly trying to do, communicate.
B008I3RARW|1.0|Marketed as a game.  Basic as it gets.  AI is pitiful.  OK for free.  Anyone who pays is a sucker.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is really fun cute graphics are really good only one complaint i wish it had a free play mode so your not on a time limit  other than that i love it
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I thought it hard to understand, so did not enjoy it at all.<br /><br />I don't have a comment on how good it was.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ok so for me this game is addicting. Only problem is that sometimes it won't work. But I recommend it to people who have patients.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fun game for when you have nothing to do like waiting at the doctors or for a plane or if your just board out of your mind.
B0072440OE|5.0|Bought if for a friend of mine who I knew liked Norah Jones. She loved that it was pressed on white vinyl. Really awesome that it came with a download for iTunes and a poster as well as with all the lyrics. Really great gift, worth the money.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game. I downloaded it and 3 hours later I'm still playing it. It has cool graphics and a good plot that you'll enjoy.
B008C0C1Y8|4.0|I used to only think this movie was just so-so, but I have a new appreciation for it now. The re-imagined recent movie, \\"Dredd,\\" is nothing but mindless, bloody action for the length of the film. There's no plot whatsoever, I mean NONE! Dredd gets trapped in a building by bad guys, then he proceeds to blow them away for the rest of the movie with hardly any dialogue or purpose given other than \\"they're bad, I'm good.\\"<br /><br />Stallone\\"s Judge Dredd is far from great, but there's a story for God's sake! This is the movie to buy if you want a Dredd movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love the book, I think is very romantic.<br />Like the way that kept me interested in reading, keep up the good work.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|Works well with the computer but with the tablet is not working with the most only a few games .
B007HACDLK|4.0|But this one grew on me. It's in the Clancy vein. Not exactly a mile-high credibility factor, but tight dialogue, lotsa action, and - most importantly : interesting and gutsy views on the whole post-Osama geopolitical scene. Pakistan does not come out of this smelling of roses, which is as it should be. Planning to go back and start with Rapp #1 and work my way through.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game<br />I loved the graphics and the style of the gameplay, all in all good game to play on the kindle, thanks!
B00860YICC|5.0|Ever since I ran across this movie (by accident) on TV one night, I have adored it!  The music is glorius.  The whole story line is happy, sad, funny, beautiful and tragic.  It is a series of snapshots into the life of a very fascinating man, with a heart wrenching ending that is also very uplifting.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Ive seen this movie dozens of times but seeing it again in 3d is well worth watching it again. The 3d really made watching this movie again a fun experience. The 3d visual effects are exciting and beautiful to watch. The jets taking off a carrier at sun rise well you need to see that yourself. Yes its still the same movie but for me watching it again in 3d was worth buying this DVD. Let me say this if your not convinced. Dog fights in 3d! Need I say more.  .
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Am still reading it! But so far I am fascinated!  Doris Kearns Goodwin is a wonderful writer.  It truly shows the genoius that Lincoln was.
B001BC5HXG|3.0|I'll preface my thoughts with the fact that I did not read East of Eden as \\"required reading\\" in high school or college, and this was the first time I read it.<br /><br />I really liked the central story of the Trask family, but there is a lot of extra clutter in this book that detracts from the main plot (and gets you close to 700 pages!).<br /><br />According to Amazon, this book \\"echoes the biblical account of Cain and Abel\\" and there is a large section that analyzes the Cain and Abel story. I found it virtually unintelligible and thought about putting the book down after that section. The story of the Trask family is good enough to stand on its own without the meandering metaphor of the Cain and Abel story.<br /><br />There are also philosophical tangents at the beginning of each \\"Part\\" of the book that don't really connect to the story, but are more just musings on life and are indecipherable at times.<br /><br />Now, on to the positive. The Trask family and its close associates are great characters containing good vs. evil and straightforward vs. manipulative dynamics. There are intriguing villains and people you want to root for. And, it's just a good story.<br /><br />To be honest, I was on the fence about whether East of Eden should get 3 or 4 stars, but I decided to go with 3 mostly because it's so long and I really felt it's length. With every other long book I've loved, I enjoyed reading it so much that it made me forget how long it actually was...and I didn't feel that way with East of Eden.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|It uses USB but acts like a serial (COM) device. When it gets a good signal, it starts spitting out NMEA location data in the form of character strings over the serial connection. It is made pretty solid. It has a magnet covered in rubber on the bottom. This makes it easy to mount it on the outside of a car. It has trouble getting a good signal if it does not have line-of-sight with the sky. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants a good quality NMEA GPS radio and knows what to do with one.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a man on a bored in the subway you double tap the screan to git the bored. it is a lot of fun.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|In a bit of a swerve, it is the monsters who fear the humans, fear their mob mentality and the pitchforks and the torches. Hidden from the human world, Hotel Transylvania stands as the last sanctuary for monsters. It is haven from human persecution. Its proprietor, Count Dracula, boasts that his hotel has been human-free since 1898. At that moment, all the monster kids in the theater watching the film probably felt a twinge of unease. Duhn-DUHN!-duhn.<br /><br />Dracula has a daughter of whom he is overprotective. To celebrate his daughter Mavis's 118th birthday, he throws a bash and invites all the horror staples from Universal Studios. Drac is one of those party hosts you just want to smack upside the head, what with his rigidly structured planning and the epic lameness of his party activities. On a more personal note, he persists in denying Mavis (Selena Gomez) her freedom. She's so curious about the humans. She longs to travel the world and experience exotic cultures and mingle with different folks. He keeps warning her of how so very dangerous humans are. Who knows how long things would have remained at status quo? But then Hotel Transylvania gets an unexpected guest. A young American backpacker. A fun-loving human. Monsters, hide your daughters.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars. It seems odd to be praising Adam Sandler for turning in a (relatively) restrained performance when that performance happens to be in his role of Count Dracula. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA certainly is an enjoyable enough picture. It presents sharp and stylized animation, thanks to Genndy Tartakovsky's vision. Tartakovsky, if you recall, is the mastermind behind fun 'toons like DEXTER'S LABORATORY, POWERPUFF GIRLS, SAMURAI JACK, and the hand-drawn Star Wars microseries, CLONE WARS (not the CGI version). I do recommend HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA but with a reservation or three.<br /><br />Them kids will love it, love the frenetic pace and the Looney Tunes vibe and the sometimes potty humor. I enjoy those as well, but I can't help it if I occasionally want something more than what's tailored for kid-oriented sensibilities. I can't help but wonder what Pixar - a studio that seamlessly balances fantastic humor and heartfelt storytelling - would've done with this. The storyline unfolds in by-the-numbers fashion. It invests so much in overcaffeinated sight gags that it sacrifices all genuine emotions. To me, those father-daughter moments between Drac and Mavis that were meant to be moving come off as so much lip service. It doesn't help that the human (Adam Sandberg) is this doltish drifter with mortifying hygiene. As a homebody and a regular bather, I am unable to identify with him. I don't even like backpacks.<br /><br />Despite all that, there's stuff to like. The film exudes such a good-natured vibe. If you like the zany, the gags do come a mile a minute, with enough of 'em hits to compensate for the misses. One of my favorites is a gag involving the Invisible Man playing Charades. I love the character designs. I like Sandler's laid-back take on Dracula, even if, somewhere, Bela Lugosi is rolling in his grave (although this probably just means the sun's almost set). Most of all, as a fan of those old-timey, black-and-white Universal creature features, I appreciate the homage intended by Tartakovsky, Sandler, and company. And I like the conceit of Count Dracula's trying his hand at entrepreneurship. I guess it's just one more way for him to bleed people dry.<br /><br />The DVd's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Filmmakers' Commentary with director Genndy Tartakovsky, producer Michelle Murdocca, and visual effects supervisor Daniel Kramer<br />- \\"Goodnight Mr. Foot\\" Animated Short Film (00:04:07 minutes)<br />- 3 Deleted Scenes, two of which are in rough draft animation (totaling 00:06:24 minutes)<br />- \\"Problem (Monster Remix)\\" Music Video by Becky G featuring Will.I.Am<br />- Behind the Scenes of the \\"Problem\\" Music Video which mostly has Will.I.Am talking about his collaboration with Becky G (00:02:22 minutes)ation with Becky G (00:02:22 minutes)
1439153663|5.0|There are so many wonderful reviews of this book I can hardly add to them. But I will tell you that the negative reviews are way off track... from those who don't want to admit that anything bad has ever happened to anyone to those who don't want their secure lives touched by anything less than Disney correct happy characters of all races who live together happily ever after. This author has delved into her time period and given an accurate and fascinating story to her readers with a lot of information about indentured lives, both black and white. I highly recommend it and say please do not let the nay sayers keep you from trying out this great read.
0345529057|5.0|I got this and it's perfect - all the books and everything are there with no damage. However, there is the problem that the books came out of order. There was Book 4, Book 1, Book 2, and Book 3. It should have gone Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, and Book 4. A bit confusing for anyone new to the series.

(and I am a nurse) Seems to drag, very disappointing. I will not be reading book 6.

B00064WSNW|5.0|King Crimson - Discipline (40th Anniversary)<br /><br />  Discipline was one of the Big 3 King Crimson albums I was into while at University.  I would oscillate between \\"Beat\\" and \\"3 of A Perfect Pair\\" and \\"Discipline\\" as to which one was the best.  I still can't make up my mind to be honest but no question the Belew era Crimson are special albums and Discipline is a masterpiece!<br /><br />  Fripp, Belew, Levin and Bruford....how can you go wrong !<br /><br />Discipline is an album that manages to cover a pretty wide territory ranging from the gentle space caverns of \\"Matte Kudasai\\" to the power prog darkness of \\"Indiscipline\\" to the quirky and almost laughable at times \\"Elephant Talk\\".<br /><br />  This album is oozing in creativity and originality and there really no other album like this that I have ever heard.  The 5.1 Mix was remastered by Porcupine Tree's Steve Wilson and although I am not a huge 5.1 surround fan when it comes to music I must admit this version is pretty cool.<br /><br />  The remastering here is way better than my previous EG RBCD copy offering much deeper sounding grooves and more reminiscent of my vinyl copy.  I hear things in a way for example on \\"Matte Kudasai\\" that I have never heard before and you can really feel the Fripp space atmospheres on this mix.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|like the nice fast pace that is a Lee Child story and this one is clever also.<br />Enjoyed it more than most but less than some of the Jack Reacher Stores
1250006341|5.0|This book was for me.  But my husband and several friends have read it and hve been very impressed.  The details of how the series is made, the furniture, clothing and the era pay tribute to Julian Fellowes.  He is a wonderful writer.  Love &#34;Downton&#34; Love the book!

B00AH8FTT2|3.0|Book 3 of the Chronicles is actually quite good but by the time you get to it you have read Volumes 1 and 2. However I do wonder if anyone who has read Archer's `As the Crow Flies' needs to read the first two volumes of the Chronicle. The plot is sufficiently similar that maybe just a cross reference of the character names would enable many of the readers to go straight to Volume 3. Of course there are differences but there is sufficient similarity that within about 20 pages of Volume 1, but it might be a bit more, the basic plot development is very familiar. This means that many of the twists that occur in Books 1 and 2 are not a surprise at all, which really does disappoint. It is sad that such a well known author should very nearly plagiarise the themes of his own works so much.<br /><br />It is not until Book 3 that he moves the fundament story into a different area.  Book 3 does advance the theme into this new territory, at least as far as the Chronicles are concerned by maybe not others of his books.  Once again it comes to an abrupt ending so who knows how many more volumes he will eek it out to.  The last sentence is effectively a question but anyone who is familiar with Archer will guess the answer.  I assume (and hope) that he is far enough in Book 4 that he will not change his mind.  That would be a real surprise and would also probably mean that it would end up being a very short story.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|this is a fantastic documentary about the life of an amazing man. many people don't know that george sang on a lot more beatles songs than people think. too bad he died from smoking. really enjoyed this movie. He wrote 2 of the best beatles songs ever<br />something<br />here comes the sun
B009E3EY38|5.0|I am writing this as I am watching the first time about halfway through. I had no idea such a thing existed but purchased it immediately upon discovery. Given the indifferent quality of Zep videos previously available, to suddenly receive a modern-day production is almost a miracle. But most importantly, I didn't know they had a show like this in them! I don't care if the video editor should be banned from his profession, or that Jimmy looks a million years old, or that Robert has the voice of a sixty year old (he gets the most out of it here), or that John Bonham is still dead. The mojo is back! It's simply an on performance. I was a little young back in the day, so I won't say it's as good as they've ever been, but it's pretty damned good. Buy it. Now.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Who doesn't like Rocky?  The price on these was to to good to pass up and I know i won't be disappointed
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Easy to read, with a lot of examples.  My daughter recommended this book to me to help me understand her sister!
B003QCCS36|5.0|Continuing his style of folk, I really enjoyed where he is going. Nice follow up to Gossip in the Grain.

0770433782|5.0|Style Me Pretty Weddings is a beautiful book, and I do mean beautiful! Filled with pages of stunning pictures and wonderful advice, I wish I had gotten this book at the beginning of my engagement instead of towards the end. I has started to get a little weary with wedding planning and the semi-constant headache that comes with it, but Style Me Pretty Weddings helped me re-focus on what really matters on my wedding day--celebrating my marriage to my wonderful fianc&eacute;.<br /><br />Even though Style Me Pretty focuses on all of the beautiful details from the wedding, it emphasizes the couple's relationship. What makes a Style Me Pretty wedding different from all of the weddings you see in magazines is the personal touches. Whether it's matching odd-ball shoes or a very whimsical and untraditional detail, a Style Me Pretty wedding expresses those details that are unique to the couple.<br /><br />Reading all of the advice from real brides and looking at all of the pretty pictures of couples who were so happy just to be spending the day together got me excited about the wedding again! Despite all of the wedding guest list headaches, occasional arguments, exciting moments, and road bumps in a few months I will be happily married to the man I have spent a fabulous six years with and I can't wait to incorporate details that are special to us into our wedding day.<br /><br />Reading all of the fantastic advice from brides and looking at all of the beautiful awe-inspiring images made me so excited about planning the wedding! I highly recommend getting this book the moment you get engaged since it is really helpful about the planning process from beginning to end.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I've written about this before. I found the book compelling , the characters, the surprises in the plot.  It took me back to the era of shame of WW II. and what it did to the Jews . A haunting reminder of man's inhumanity to man. She did a great job.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book but the ending could have been a little better left you hanging.  Left you wanting more what happened to Gale?  What happens next?
B0038AUY96|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the Harry Hole character. A great whodunnit. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good murder mystery.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This was a really great movie for the entire family.  For a video game fan, I truly appreciated the characters.
B007SGM084|5.0|We know there is always something that is hidden, secrets to be revealed. But most stories' twist is too out there. You can almost guess from the usual options: leading man had a sad past, parents divorced, bad childhood- beaten up, sick or dying, or part of gang went south or what not. Girls have been cheated on or always a virgin.<br /><br />But this trilogy is just twisted in so many ways that it is sooo good!! You never really know what to expect or to assume. The story wasn't common and I really loved every angle of it. I don't really like reading books; (I even had to challenge myself from reading this) but I am glad I did.<br /><br />Now after almost 10mos since I finished reading this. I haven't really touched any other book that can throw this off my top 1 spot. Well, I only read like 3 others since then. Lol. But I think even if I was a reader, I'd still say this one deserves a 5-star! :)
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This game is like a maze where you have a limited amount of pencil. The less you draw, the higher the score. I would also like to mention that some levels also have buttons you have to have the mouse press. Highly recommended.

B005C8ENI0|4.0|It had interesting plot with some twists but predictable in the end. Interesting concept overall and good twist to to Start the movie. Acting was alright.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't normally write alot of reviews, I read alot, I enjoy reading alot and if its a good book once I start I will lose sleep over finishing the book, I will literally stay up and read until I'm done, this is exactly what happened with this book as I finished it at 4:30 a.m. today. I wasn't sure whether to get this book or not due to some of the more negative reviews, but I'm really not sure how anyone could feel anything but positive about this book. It was wonderful, and its still weighing on my mind. An absolutely beautiful love story between two individuals that have endured so much. Some of the reviews made it sound like this book was full of sex and inappropriateness, I didn't find that at all. I could only hope my child would have the same values and morals that this girl did when it came to her body (although the characters stemmed from something much deeper; of course I wouldn't wish for that) I would be proud if she waited to give herself to someone who she loved with every bit of her soul. The story was deep and meaningful and if you are reading this contemplating whether or not to purchase this book, I say do it, don't go into with preconceived negativities posted by others on here, just read and let this book pull you in as it did me. For those of you who reviewed negatively are you sure you read this book? Really? I do know someone commented and quoted parts of how the writer wrote certain aspects of the book, the way I read this it was to simply pull us into the mind of that moment and what they were feeling and experiencing and I'm probably one of the worst critiquers when it comes to things like this, but I didn't take it the same way others have portrayed it here in the reviews. Overall this was worth every bit of the 5 stars I'm giving it and I thoroughly enjoyed this book
B00A757EFW|5.0|great
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I was surprised that this was as good as it was.  The last few entries in the never ending releases of his stuff were mediocre at best.  This sounds good and even though these are re-workings of some of the same songs, they are pretty good. To give it 5 stars would say it's as good as what he released when he was alive.  Of course that's not the case.  One thing that is amazing is that he's released more albums over 40 years than those artists still with us. [at least it seems that way] He certainly lives on.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Since the day I installed the SwiftKey, I never switched to anything else. The predictions and auto complete is so awesome and self learning.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|great
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with Skyfall.  As a fan of the entire Bond catalog, yes even Never Say Never Again, this movie not only fits right in with it's cohorts but actually floats to the top of the pile.  It has all the action, espionage, seduction, gadgets, and beautiful locales you would expect. It is by far my favorite Daniel Craig movie, it's an extremely well crafted film and an engrossing story.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|great
B009HUB40Y|5.0|if anyone is into games like me, u will like this game...i play this every day and have it linked to my Facebook..
B001E45XT4|5.0|bought these to replace a pair just like them, the mic broke, but they are excellent products!!!! my son loves them
0446604844|4.0|This is one of Baldacci's earlier books.  Copyrighted in 1997.  Exciting topic.  Rambles a little.  Check this against his later books and you can see how far he has gone.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I cannot recall having ever written a book review which is ashamed considering how many wonderful books I have read by equally talented authors.  However, had one of my friends not recommended this book to me, I would have missed out on a truly masterful work of fiction. I believe the most important element in a book is the characters and how they are developed throughout the book.  I felt emotionally attached to this book's main character and genuine sorrow in regards to some of the situations in which he often found himself.  I felt burning anger towards those characters who treated him so unfairly.  I could probably fill several pages listing all of the reasons why I love this book.  Simply put... This book is fantastic, and I highly recommend it!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the movie and the extras, and the digital copy was an excellent quality on my Kindle and computer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series since Sopranos. .. Although sometimes you're actually hoping certain characters get bitten...also the series is a good exercise in zombie apocalypse preparation tips.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I love this movie. The special effects are insane. Yes I wish the characters were all as good as Theron but its still an insane movie. The soundtrack is also killer. Its been almost a year and I'm still obsessed with this movie.
B0037VNX44|5.0|If you want to leave scratching your head, laughing til it hurts, and being completely shocked, this is the film for you. Doesn't hurt that Tom Hardy is an incredible actor to boot!!! A must for any Hardy lover!
B000F9RB94|4.0|The cast is excellent, Samuel L Jackson , Colin Ferrell, and LL Cool J  have a great chemistry. The plot could have been a little more believable. but there is lots of action
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I love pretty much every actor in this flick. While it's peppy and up beat its phrase and tone can lead you to scratch your head and say &#34;did they really just go from that to a THAT scene!!!&#34;. Keep your mind open where it's cute its adorably precious and when it's not, well it's not for too long so enjoy the verbal sparring and you should have a grand ole time of it.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|Awesome special effects, good cast and sticking to the comic make this one of the better comic book renditions. cage scores as the rider with Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott score in supporting roles
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|My four star rating comes from the fact that this is a free app and it has some good work out ideas that keep you moving and allow you to get started on a routine that is easy to follow and accomplish, even if you are new to work out videos.  You can skip the ones you don't or can't do and you can pause. You can't go back, however, so you just have to start again and skip if you want to repeat exercises. Overall it is very good and straightforward.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Young Val Kilmer does a creditable job in this flick, all my grandchildren have seen it multiple times and they just love it
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a great game.  The mystery is interesting and challenging, but not so difficult that it's frustrating.  I thought the best part was the plentiful HO games.  They are very well done.  The graphics are beautiful and the objects cleverly hidden.  I'm also playing Empress of the Deep right now and the HO scenes in the game aren't nearly as good.
B003YOZNBK|3.0|Never have been a big Josh Brolin fan, liked his dad much better..the special effects are ok. As far as buying this movie, unless you are a huge fan and want to watch it more than once, stick to rentals
B00A77II0U|5.0|Wow.  This game is fantastic!  The graphics are really beautiful.  I just finished Enigmatis and thought the graphics in that game were good, but Stray Souls is even better.  I also really like how the game map tells you the areas where you still need to complete a task or tasks, and what areas you'll need to return to later.  In addition to a help button, the voodoo doll comes along with you on your travels, offering comments and/or assistance now and then.  There's also a strategy guide in-game, but I haven't needed it so far.  I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing this game to HOG fans- you won't regret it!  UPDATE:  Finished the game. Fantastic ending.  I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say that I was really impressed with the whole game from start to finish.  The only negative that I noticed was the items to find in the HO scenes repeated pretty much every time which was a little disappointing.  There were so many items in the HO scenes there really was no need to repeat.
B008I3RARW|3.0|With one course and limited selection for cars, I can't see any reason someone would pay 5$ for this.<br /><br />I will say that this plays awesome on my nexus 7! Graphics are nice, controls are decent, not much I would complain about.<br /><br />Just, where is the content?? We should have varied cars, or purchases after each race, and a circuit series.  I kind of expected something like a 3D version of RC ProAm or one of those old arcade games.<br /><br />I would let the kids play this, but I got bored quickly without other content.
B008I3RARW|3.0|Only a very new gamer or a young child say, 10, 11 or younger, would like this game. There's nothing too wrong with it, per se... It's just very very basic.<br /><br />1 track only.<br /><br />1 car only, although you may change the color... Maybe red is faster, I dunno lol<br /><br />There is no way to upgrade your car.<br /><br />There are no powerups, coins, speed boost, or ANYTHING.<br /><br />This game is simply one track, one car, a gas pedal, a brake pedal, (and another pedal that can only be the clutch??? but there is no manual shift mode...unless I missed something.) and three game modes, Race mode against the computer cars (there's only like two, so three cars racing if you include yourself, not exactly nail biting competition...), Time Mode, where you try to complete the race by yourself and see how fast you can do it. Then countdown mode, which is like time mode except the clock runs backwards and when it hits zero you lose.<br /><br />So, yeah, very extremely basic game. So just don't get it unless you are prepared for the ramifications...
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It was difficult for me to attach to Gus because he seemed so protected by barriers and emotional walls. He never seemed genuine to me. It sucks cuz I feel like the book didn't really do s*** for me. I wasn't sad or inspired, I was just waiting for Gus to not be perfect. Strange I guess.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Awesome!! I would recommend this ro anyone who needs to be handsfree while driving.  The convience is unparalled while in traffic! !
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This product did not work and I am having to use a borrowed cable to charge my Kindle.  I am not sure if the the other part of the connection would have fixed the problem
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You can choose from different horses and leveling up is very easy. The competitions are fun to do but get harder as you level up. I wish they had a little wider variety of horses but other than that this is the best horse game that I have ever played. This game doesn't glitch and has very good graphics. I highly recommend this game.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I will watch anything with Bruce Willis in it! He is one cool actor......If you haven't seen this movie you need to especially if you like Bruce Willis. Cool special effects............Watch It!!
B008CRC506|5.0|I love season one and was disappointed that my favorite song was not on the CD. Other than that it waswonderful!
B00942X8PY|5.0|This is a really fun puzzle game where you have to get the right patterns to drag each color in the allotted number that you have to use.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This book can hold your attention and is amusing.  Offers insight into how to live in okd age as an adventurer without stress or anxiety.  I would recommend this for a fun fast read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|forced myself to finish thinking it may be worth my time...NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And amazon requiring 9 more words.........STUPID....Really 4 more words??...........not worth a review or my time
B005XN31LY|5.0|We love this show.  Our whole family watches this one and enjoys it.  I am so glad to have a show we can all watch.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|For lonely women with no life.............I heard too much b.s. for other people saying better than book 1...LOL book one sucked too!!! forced myself to finish book 1...........read about 10 pages of book 2............LAME
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is a great way to see how life might have been in the wealthy english class during WWII era.  Not for kids though.
0061478784|5.0|This book is easy to get lost in. If you are a fan of fantasy, magic, and romance then this is a wonderful quick read.
B009GED3HS|3.0|We missed a whole season of these on our tivo and then had to buy some to catch up.  We just forgot how raunchy the show can be and it seemed like there was way more sexual content then we remembered.  Disappointing.  When a show has to resort to that to be considered funny, one wonders if it is on it's way out.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|Good story line with some surprises thrown in. Love of self, love of others and all the hub bub surrounding loving and fear based thinking.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book ready for another one from this author. . This book will keep you interested all the way to the end.  Can't wait to see the movie now too.  Go ahead and read this one it is worth your time.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I will continue to rate a single star for every movie that I watch when it continually stops to reload, and it's not on my end either, Netflix streams perfect HD, so I know it's Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like solitaire. It keeps me busy for hours. When I don't have nothing to do or when i am stressed out. It takes my mind off of it.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|I think the knife is very well made. Heavy and definitely solid. The knife is pretty good for chopping wood and stuff like that. For the price I would say its a good buy but would not consider this knife the \\"ultimate survival knife\\".
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Was a gift for a friend and it's one of her favorite movies, she enjoyed it. I like the movie as well.
B0088ZSKOC|1.0|The download quality was so poor the ap was unusable. Would love to know how to get my money back.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Was a gift, haven't watched it but my father in law liked it, man movie indeed entertaining, maybe I should watch it sometime, lol
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This product wasn't for me. I bought it for a friend's birthday. Since he hasn't complained to me about it once, I assume that the quality is satisfactory.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Bought as gift, he enjoyed it, entertaining movie but the first is still my favorite. I'm not going to review the movie here, there's plenty of places that do that. [...]
B0010358CQ|3.0|Still a good anime but its not near as good as the original. Has the same look witch i like but just didn't pop like the original did. If you're a fan of apple seed then I'd say its worth a buy, if not id rent it first. (if you can find it)
0525478817|5.0|The book is very good, I love John Green's writing. It's not cheesy, it's casual, very touching and genuinely interesting.<br /><br />I have a hardback book in a dust cover. I don't like the dust covers at all, I just don't get the idea. If the dust cover eventually becomes dirty or torn, I'll just have a black hardback book without any drawing on it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to teenagers and adults if they don't mind reading about 16-year-old protagonists.
143911000X|5.0|bought this as a gift for my boyfriend because we watch HIMYM or netflix and it doesnt show the bro tip at the end like they sometimes do on tv. lots of laughs and quotes from this book in our every day life now.
B008I3RARW|3.0|The graphics and sound aren't exactly impressive, but it's a nice racing game.<br />You have several options to choose from, and the steering is the most interesting: you can opt for motion (tilt) for steering AND acceleration.<br />This is the only racing app I know that can be controlled with tilt only.<br />Once racing, the upper left of the screen lets you change to night mode, switch camera view and more.<br />Of course, if you are uncomfortable with the tilt-only mode you can switch to paddle or stick control for acceleration. The game IS playable in bed even when your device is tilted at an odd angle.<br />A small inset in the upper right corner shows what is behind you.<br /><br />I think the opponents are a bit slow however.<br />Well - customize your formula 1 race car and give it a spin :)
B007SGM084|5.0|It's awesome and very intriguing it holds your attention and keep s you eager to read more. Definitely one of my favorite books
