B00005JMJ4|4.0|I'm a Japanese man and has just returned from seeing &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; which opened today in Tokyo. Having read some reviews beforehand, I expected the movie might not be very enjoyable, but I find it fascinating instead. I was not offended at all by it and actually laughed many times watching<BR>the movie.<br />I think that the movie captures fairly well how contemporary Japan, in which modern, busy parts are mixed with old, serene traditions in a chaotic way, looks to the two Americans who have little knowledge about or interest in the country they are staying. I can understand well that they feel lost, surrounded by a language, people, and customs they are not familiar with.<br />With regard to the pronunciation, I think that any Japanese who has once learned English knows that it is very difficult to make a distinction between &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, as there is no such distinction in Japanese. And I understand well that would be funny to native speakers of English, as the two Americans in the movie.<br />But I think that would be the case when you hear foreigners speaking your mother tongue, not limited to English. I'm happy to tell my friends coming from abroad that it is not easy for Japanese to make distinctions not only between &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, but also between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, &quot;TH&quot; and &quot;S&quot; and some others.<br />On the scene of the prostitute, I think it is a little bit overdone. And the scene of the nude dancers would not be really necessary to the plot of the movie. But such dancers do exist in Tokyo, and you could go to see them if you would like to, however disturbing that might be.<br />I think it is true that Japanese characters in U.S. movies tend to be portrayed as one-dimensional, lacking emotional or intellectual depth, but that is not new, and Japanese are all aware of that. As far as I understand, the focus of the movie is not on forming a relationship between the two Americans and the Japanese surrounding them, but rather lack of it, corresponding to their lives back in their home country. In that sense, I think it would be appropriate for the movie to emphasize that they don't understand what the Japanese are talking or doing around them.<br />Some people might enjoy laughing at the Japanese who mix &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm rather amused by the Americans who are confused in a foreign country of which they have little knowledge. I even guess there might be some Americans who are offended by this portrayal of their fellow<BR>citizens as being ignorant and arrogant.<br />YARIME Masaru
0451191153|5.0|Fabulous book, absolutely fabulous.<BR>Ayn Rand hits you hard with her philosophy of Objectivism in this thrilling classic. It's theme? Individualism versus collectivism. This is about a man living life as he wants to, as he should want to, and all of the pain he suffers because of it. <BR>If you're not into the philosophy, at least read it to be exposed to the writing style. Rand's writing style is so brilliant, so perfect, so dashing and in-your-face, so daringly, startlingly blunt. She says only what she needs to, only when she needs to.<BR>Rand planned out this novel very hard, for several months dreaming and thinking of nothing but Howard Roark, Ellsworth M. Toohey, Peter Keating, Gail Wynand and Dominique Francon. And the result is stunning.
B00004W52U|5.0|When people see this album at stores they imagine four, random teenages / early twenties kids picking up instruments and jamming. This is true.<BR>However, they don't realize how those four young men also changed the way people would view punk rock and ska for ever. Sure, there was hardcore / ska political music before this. But most if it was so incredibly hard to listen to, that no one would. These guys are talented at everything they do. Decent guitar riffs, GREAT lyrics and melodies. Pick up this CD. Unless your a skinhead like someone else said, you'll really enjoy it and i think it will open you up to some more great albums. ENjoy !
B0000C8AW5|4.0|This is certainly one of Dylan's more underrated albums, along with Nashville Skyline and New Morning. The Band are terrific and it's a great little set of songs as well. To be honest, there are a couple of songs here that don't do much for me, i.e. Dirge and You Angel You, but songs like Never Say Goodbye and Wedding Song (which end the album on a great note) make up for the occasional flat spot. Tough Mama and On A Night Like This are also terrific but best of all is Hazel, which features one of Bob's prettiest melodies (in fact, it kind of reminded me of an Elton John type of melody). Hazel would be in my top 5 Dylan songs except for the fact that Bob hits a couple of really awful notes (even for him) vocally on this one which I have to say kind of spoils it for me. Still a great listen though, highly recommended if you can't get enough of Dylan.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I waited in line to see this movie as soon as it came out. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the &quot;roller coaster ride&quot; that the second movie was, so I didn't see it in the theater again. When the DVD was released I snapped it up immediately. You see, this is the kind of movie that must be watched again and again to be appreciated. I have a short attention span so I don't watch many movies twice--let alone again and again. My point is this: If you paid attention to the first two movies you got the impression that the Human Race was screwed a long time ago. If you watched The Animatrix they spelled it out for you. The Machines had won and no rebellion by a few thousand humans was going to make any difference. Neo or not. The Matrix Revolutions ended the story in the only way believable--which the rules say I can't reveal here. If you saw the movie in the theater once, buy or rent the DVD and watch it again. It's good. It's certainly worth 20 bucks. And it provides true closure to the story. What more could you expect?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you never watched Firefly on TV, you missed out. Fortunately, you can buy the DVD!! This fantasic series about a roving band of futuristic outlaws has some of the best writing a TV series has ever seen (including Northern Exposure). It's funny, exciting, surprising, mysterious, unexpected, and with unique and sharply-drawn characters, it's altogether addicting! Unlike so many sci-fi shows, there are no big green aliens or shape shifters, just humans living on outlying planets struggling to get by. With echoes of the Old West and Chinese culture enriching the show's ambience, and great camera work that makes you feel like you're in the action, Firefly leaves Star Trek in the dust. You can watch the episodes repeatedly, and the added comentary is great. Everyone involed knew how great the show was; now you can know too.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This is the most authentic portrayal of the Georgian Navy on film, even if its based on fiction. The damp and rotting ships, the calamity of battle, the tempestuous and capricious seas. They are all there. The movie-makers give realistic (and well acted) characters, breathtaking visuals and a sense of authenticity not seen since \\"Damn the Defiant\\". Highly recommended indeed.
B0001D0FTW|3.0|I was troubled by this album for quite some time, thinking about it, and I think I'm finally able to write down what I think.  Hellfire Club is definitely better than Mandrake, but it's not as good as Theater of Salvation or Vain Glory Opera, both of which were excellent.  I think the problem with Hellfire Club is that each song follows a very simple and predictable formula, with the choruses and verses, and it gets a bit too repetitive.  Past releases had a lot more variation; on Vain Glory Opera, for example, each song was very unique from one another.  The same cannot be said about Hellfire Club.  Take, for example, The Piper Never Dies.  It starts out nice, but falls apart halfway through the song.  Each song seems to out-stay its welcome, adding another chorus and plummeting into repetitiveness.  The music isn't as unique or creative as previously releases, either.  I found myself bored of this release after only two weeks, and I've only listened it to a few times since then, instead putting Theater of Salvation or Vain Glory Opera, or Lost Horizon's A Flame to the Ground Beneath in my CD player.  After Mandrake, which itself was just good and not great, this offers the same \\"It could have been better\\" feeling.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I can't believe that neither Reloaded or Revolutions were even nominated for the Academy Awards, and I'm not saying that they deserved the &quot;best movie&quot; award, but I think (and I believe a lot of people do) that these movies REALLY deserved at least a nomination for &quot;best special effects&quot;. Come on, everyone knows that the Matrix trilogy opened a whole new world on the special effects area, and Revolutions it's no exception, since it has the best special effects ever seen on a movie. All of these can be confirmed when you watch the &quot;special features DVD&quot; that comes with the movie, where you can see some of the amazing and exhausting job that all the team did to make us &quot;believe the unbelievable&quot;. So, don't you think it's unbelievable that The LOR won the &quot;special effects&quot; award? I do, but I also think now that most of these &quot;award shows&quot; are just that: Shows.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I had read Blender's review of this album, they rated it as the best album of 2003. I had already heard some of the White Stripes and decided I to spend my R150 (+/- $23) on Elephant. I put it on when I got home and wasn't dissapointed. Below is my track ratings out of ten, along with reasons and my favourite line/s on the song.<br />1) Seven Nation Army 10/10 - Fantastic. A great riff with clever lyrics make this the best possible opening. &quot;I'm going to Wichita/ Far from this opera for evermore.&quot;<br />2) Black Math 6/10 - Probably my least favourite track, a bit irritating. &quot;Maybe I'll put my love on ice.&quot;<br />3) There's No Home For You Here 10/10 - A fantastically good ' I hate you' song, with cool solos and vocal effects. &quot; So completely stupid/Just go away.&quot;<br />4) I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself 9/10 - A great cover, turning Bacharach's love song, into a strange story of stalker like desparation. A cool video too, you'll understand when you see it. &quot;Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain/ I need your sweet love to fill me up again.&quot; (Or so I think?)<br />5) In The Cold, Cold Night 7/10 - Not a bad song, it's just not one of my favourite, nice to hear Meg find her voice, though. &quot; And I know that you feel it too/ When my skin turns into glue.&quot;<br />6) I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart 9/10 - A good, simple song about Jack trying impress a gir's mother but not succeeding. &quot;I'm inclined to go finish high school/Just to make her notice that I'm around&quot;<br />7) You've Got Her In Your Pocket 8/10 - Quite a sad acoustic track, good nonetheless. &quot;You've got her in your pocket/ Where there's no way out.&quot;<br />8) Ball and Biscut 10/10 - A long Bluesey track where the guitar takes over and becomes the real star.&quot;But it's my mother who made me the seventh son&quot;( I personally have no clue what the entire song is about)<br />9)The Hardest Button To Button 9/10 -  AgainI have no idea about buttoning or whatever's going on here, but its a cool catchy tune. &quot;Now we're a family!&quot;<br />10)Litte Acorns 8/10 - Wierdest song on the album (&quot;Be like the Squirrel girl&quot;) and a bit irritating, but worth alisten. Strange intro is funny. &quot;Your problems hide in you curls.&quot;<br />11)Hypnotize 7/10 -  Not bad, but not great. &quot; Be your right hand man/ till your hands get old&quot;<br />12)The Air Near My fingers 9/10 - A good song, with some good lyrics. &quot;Life's so Boring/ It's really got me snoring&quot;<br />13)Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine 9/10 - A rocking high- energy guitar song. &quot; Give me a sugar pill and watch me just rattle down the street&quot;<br />14) Well It's True That We Love Each Other 8/10 -  A quirky end to a great album. &quot; Jolly good! Get us some tea then Bruce!&quot;
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I didn't see this movie in the theaters after hearing so many negative comments from reviewers and viewers alike, but saw it on DVD, and realized that the many critics who panned &quot;Revolutions&quot; were scrutinizing it with far too hard an eye. It may not present anything new in terms of ideas or lead to you ask and ponder the answer to any questions as the first &quot;Matrix&quot; may have done, but it's a pleasantly entertaining popcorn flick, with at least two or three truly entertaining sequences -- one involving the Sentinels entering Zion and causing death and chaos within, and Neo's battle against Agent Smith on a rain-soaked city street. The third scene isn't surprising for its actions or thrills, but because, for arguably the first time, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss show something resembling emotion in their main scene together -- Neo is blinded and their ship crashes, and Neo crawls over to Trinity and Trinity tells him that she's not going with him -- he asks why, and then feels several large metal rods have impaled her body.<BR>The only weaknesses I found were that the characters of Ghost (Anthony Wong) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) were greatly underused, especially Ghost -- who is seemingly not used at all (seems like he even had more time in &quot;Reloaded&quot; where he had little). But then I guess the &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; videogame is meant to fill in for his and Niobe's small roles in the films. Link (Harold Perrineau) also goes largely unused here -- his wife Zee (Nona Gaye) gets more of the screen time -- but after the somewhat touching moments they had in &quot;Reloaded&quot; I expected more of their story in the finale. But aside from these small quibbles, the film's popcorn-munching entertainment, and only the hardest critic will not be biting their nails seeings swarms of thousands and thousands of Sentinels wreaking havoc in Zion.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore's \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" is a fitting conclusion of more then 7 years of work which took to complete the trilogy. In this last installment the bittersweet \\"Ring Motif\\" acquires trully mystical proportions with the descend of darkness and as Frodo is finally taken up by the powers of the Ring. The theme of the \\"Riders of Rohan\\" is one of my favourites - strong penetrating strings are accompanied by trimphant wind instruments as riders charge into the battle. Pippin's song in the \\"Stuart of Gondor\\" captures everybody's imagination (the lyrics are actually Bilbo's from the times of gathering garkness) as Faramir's suiside charge to recapture Osgiliath proceeds in the background (you can hear the horse gallop). Final songs, \\"Into the West\\" specifically, go on into the everlasting sorrow, as the victory means the profound change in the world, elves are leaving and the men are left on their own in the world devoid of magic.
B000000OSE|4.0|There are some people here who seem a little confused on this albulm. While this CD certainly has hard rock songs, it is not a hard rock albulm. This is more ofa hard rock-blues rock fusion. Use Your Illusions I was the first part of the Use Your Illusions multi CD debut. It was the first time an artist debuted two cds in Number 1(Illusions I) and Number 2(Illusions II) on the Billboard charts. That being said, there are some great songs on this cd. While nothing rocks quite as hard as Welcome to the Jungle off the Apetite cd, November Rain easily matches and then surpasses rock ballad Sweet Child o Mine. Also COma easily trumps Paradise City as far as &quot;off the wall track&quot; and when you throw in Dust and Bones and Dead Horse, you have a great albulm. Not as good as Appetite for Destruction, but then again, nothing is.
0553582445|3.0|I just finished reading the Farseer Trilogy, and I have to say that I enjoyed it much more than the Tawny Man.<br />The Tawny Man starts from a very interesting premise (at least for those of us who are over 30): to tell the story of the hero after he &quot;lives happily ever after&quot; (or not).  Not having read the Farseer Trilogy at the time, I didn't find the book slow at all, and I found the characters wonderfully complicated.<br />Now the bad part: the rest of this trilogy has very little to do with this first book.  In fact, I suspect that if Hobb had just appended the Golden Fool (book 3) to the Farseer Trilogy, it would have made for a much more satisfying read.  As it is, while fun to read, most of this new series turns out to be mostly irrelevant.<br />And, if you are a fan of the Fool, this new series will leave you as disappointed with how his future is treated as the Farseer Trilogy did.
B00005RDSM|5.0|Peter Pan is one of the most entertaining and charming Disney movies ever made.  It follows the adventures of Wendy, John, and Michael Darling, and of course the boy who never grew up, Peter Pan.  Captain Hook is one of the funniest and evil villains ever created and his first mate, Smee, is absolutely hilarious.<BR><BR>  I have to admit that this movie doesn't follow the book very much, but is better.  The characters are so much more lovable in Disney's tale.  Now why couldn't Barrie be this imaginative?<BR><BR>  A new, live version of Peter Pan recenyly came out. and when I saw it I couldn't help but be disappointed.  I missed all of those timeless songs, charming characters, and humor.  Peter was dressed as if he came straight from the jungle, and unfortunately it followed the book.  I know you may think that sounds odd of me to say that I didn't like it because it was an accurate adaption, but it's true.<BR><BR>  So if you want to watch an exciting and classic movie buy this DVD.
B000003TA4|1.0|Looking at Nevermind on a musical level, it still doesn't hold up. Nevermind is hyped for how &quot;revolutionary&quot; it is, but is it anything special? No. I'm now reading about how Cobain is supposedly Generation X's equivalent of John Lennon. I am lumped into the generation branded &quot;X&quot;, and Kurt Cobain is not my John Lennon. Lennon is my Lennon. He is truly a legend because he left a legacy of love and freedom; Kurt Cobain is the polar opposite of him, so there is no room for comparison. Cobain professed his hatred for those not like him (he despised all athletes just because he had a few bad experiences with some in school). Cobain was also not for love and freedom, because he was bound by the selfishness and shackles of heroin addiction.<br />Look at these &quot;profound&quot; lyrics, and have a good laugh (yes, they are the actual words straight from Cobain's pen: &quot;I'm on a plane/I can't complain&quot; (from On a Plain), &quot;I got my diddly spayed&quot; (Beeswax), &quot;You give, you give, you get/You get to me&quot; (Pen Cap Chew), and &quot;Little men eat and run/Poke your ass for the fun&quot; (from Pay to Play). Now that you're done rolling on the floor, now how many of you can honestly claim Cobain is Lennon-esque? I recommend anything by Lennon and the Beatles instead of Nirvana. But if you're looking for straight out-and-out rock mastery, I will say with high regard to go for Jimi Hendrix, the god of the guitar. I'm sure Jimi is up in heaven rocking out, having a good old time in a psychedelic haze, while Cobain is stuck in the bowels of hell... with Smells like Teen Spirit blaring and mocking him for eternity.
6304806418|5.0|Now first let me state that this one of my favorite movies. I have also researched into the life of Eva Peron. The movie is about 95% true. Madonna stars in movie as the title role of Evita. This movie is the story of Argentina's former first lady, Eva Peron. This film starts from the end and then goes from beginning to end. It shows how she went to Buenos Aires with a tango singer. It shows hows Eva took on lovers to get jobs, and even helped her husband, who is played by Jonathan Pryce, get the presidency for 2 terms. She and her husband did have 2 weddings, one was in a church and one was a civil ceremony. Eva also traveled while she was first lady. She got woman the right to vote. She also did start a foundation. She did help build houses, hopitals, and schools. When her husband went for his 2nd term as president, the people rallied for her to be vice-president. Eva Peron did had many Christain Dior, over 100 furs, and a jewelry collection comparable to Cleopatra's. Sadly, Evita died when she was just 33, of uterine cancer. This movie won some Acadmeny awards and a gloden globe, I believe

B00000JQFM|5.0|Joe Satriani in my opinion with this album took Instrumental rock where it has never been before. Every song is a gem on this, and Joe's songs on other albums are great too (aka 'Extremist') but let's focus on this one now.<br />*1) Surfing With the alien - a great song, GREAT rythm and very unpredictable lead parts. I can totally picture surfing with an alien in my mind when hearing this. Simply Brilliant. 5/5<br />*2) Ice #9 - weird but very sweet rythm, once again unpredictable lead parts. My fave part of this song is the crazy solo which reminds me of a car in a blizzard with the radio on... 5/5<br />*3)Crushing days - a great rocker, nice intro. and VERY VERY sweet lead rythm, the first 5 songs r some of my favourites from the album. 5/5<br />*4)Always with me, Always with you - a GREAT ballad, he uses the guitar like vocals here. Extremely beautiful and well written. a truly beautiful song 5/5<br />*5) Satch Boogie - another hit from the album, this ones probably the fastest (bpm wise) a very good boogie song.Another Classic (thats 5 of the best songs on this album in a row!)<br />6) Hill of the skull - A small, but nice little tune. Has quite an eerie sound. It is under 2 min long, but really settles down the CD after the fast satch boogie and lead us pretty well into the next song.... 5/5<br />7) Circles - eerie opening, but a great solo, this song stirs up some feelings that i cannot explain.<br />8)Lords of Karma - real nice guitar and cool riffs here, a really nice song. It gets outta the eerier stuff from before and is a rocker. 5/5<br />*9) Midnight- A BEAUTIFUL song another one of my fave along with the first 5, GREAT tapping techniques, a short song but a beauty. 5/5<br />10) Echo - a sad seeming song/eerie with cool guitar and great riffs, this one stirs up even more emotions then circles did. Makes you feel really peaceful. 5/5<br />* = top best songs on the album

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw the film in Tokyo's Shibuya where a lot of the scenes were set. No subtitles for the Japanese dialog since the cinema was in Japan. Why did it take so long to get released in Japan (today 4/17/2004)? And why only one theater in Tokyo? The lines were very long, and typical of Tokyo they sell more tickets than seats available, so many sat on the floor or stood. This underscores the film that many don't get... a megalopolis of 30 million, and foreigners on the fringe. I appreciate that Sophia Coppala spent a lot of time here, and it is very evident in the film. WOW. How touching, even for the Japanese who saw life through our eyes. The best part is after leaving the theater, the facination continued through this great experience I'm having here in Tokyo in my life. I must admit, I've cried myself several times the past few months due to alienation and hope based on the need to fit in and be held by someone who understand me. (so many reviews I don't anyone will ever read this)
B00005YW4H|5.0|Wow!! In an era of Brittany Spears, Jessica Simpson, etc... we have finally found someone with musical soul. I will admit purchasing this CD was met with some skepticism but after hearing the entire CD I was impressed. A great CD that will not be a waste of money. It is a great CD to relax to or just to sit down and read a book.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This album is the be-all and end-all of live 70s progressive rock. The almost 3-hr long album, listened from beginning to end is an exhilarating experience. Yessongs turned my life around as a musician, changing me forever after listening one night to the Firebird Opening followed by the fantastic Siberian Khatru, already over 20 years ago. The album is basically the Close To The Edge tour, but it includes &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; and &quot;Long Distance Runaround / The Fish&quot; from the Fragile tour. The sound is rather raw, but it adds to the performance, in the days when Yes was powerful and at its peak of live improvisations. &quot;Clap&quot; - Steve Howe's solo - appears on the Yessongs video only. &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Cans And Brahms&quot;, and &quot;South Side Of The Sky&quot; were also played on these tours, but regretfully do not appear in Yessongs... The artwork of the original vinyl album is simply fantastic, depicting the departure and arrival of a new civilization through space. The North American CD packaging does not make enough justice to this jewel. Try to get the Japanese mini-cardboard edition, or even better the vinyl album if possible. Yessongs is indeed another name for the Bible!!
B000084T18|1.0|Wow. What horrible \\"music.\\" Funny thing is, 50 Cent's rhymes don't even RHYME. His lyrics include (not making this up) telling a woman that he loves her \\"like a fat kid loves cake.\\" I used to listen to rap music in the 90's. Then, I graduated from junior high school. This is the epitome of immature, childish music. And, I must admit, rap was alot more original (Dr. Dre, Tupac) in the 90's. Almost all people I know who listen to this (...) aren't some dangerous, drug-dealing, car-stealing, inner-city gangsters, but they are white, upper-middle class, preppy high schoolers (no joke) who drive around my city with the bass up with this trash and are too stupid to know better. The stereotypes about rap fans are very false. The real universal popular music includes Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Nirvana. Unfortunately, Top 40 radio almost only plays crap like this and Justin Bimbobaked, that is why I stopped listening to it about 2 years ago. As much as this (...), there is some decent music out there. The Darkness, the Strokes, Fuel, Lostprophets, and other bands that are played on modern rock radio are decent. If you are between the ages of 12-18, you probably think this kitsch makes you look \\"rebellious.\\" That is the only explanation. News alert: 20 years from now, you'll probably wish you never heard this, like many 40-year-olds regret and deny listening to Tom Petty and Poison. Why this gained nonstop airplay, critical success, 6 times platinum sales, and GRAMMY nominations is an unexplainable mystery, like the Bermuda Triangle. \\"In 'da' club\\" is downright rotten, and \\"Magic Stick\\" is the cheesiest, stupidest attempt at (...) innuedo since the awful boy-band craze of the nineties. Use your \\"Fitty\\" cents to buy something more intelligent and fun, like a Pet Rock or ear plugs.
B00005OM4N|5.0|The whole album is something between dancey-urban-r'n'b pop. the first song you think about it is:i'm a slave 4 u,that is written by the neptunes:a very funky dance pop song and you'll just love it if you are addicted to the popular britney dance-moves.you can also find overprotected-something like ...baby one more time beat but still is way too different.is cool this track.then is lonely-yeah is such a great song,because it has this r'n'b-pop sounds,is good for the 'say bye-bye to your ex',it kinda makes you stronger,in a way.So yeah,it's a really cool and catchy track.Of course here it comes:i'm not a gril not yet a woman,it's<BR>written bye Dido-more like a honey-baby ballad-teen spirit,though the message is that britney is becoming a woman the beat remains to old formal smash hits:it's good for relaxation;i like it!Ahh for the stupid who said that Britney didn't write anything on this album then they are so major asswh@res...first she written MORE then half of the songs from this album so yeah..anyway.Let's see..Anticipating:is more like an urban-modern-disco-pop tune,i love it!It's for those who love to dance:such a great fun pop song.Then it's i love rock'n'roll and thank god is not such a crap like The beat goes on.More like new rock,yeah worth the money!My fave song is Let me be:it related with Janet's Jackson new songs..so it's aawesome:more like r'n'b pop.There are another few tracks that are really catchy fun pop,such as:Bombastic Love,What is like to bbe me and Cindirella.I love this three songs!So in the end this album is AWESOME!!Rush out and buy it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|How much do I love this movie? Let me count the ways. First of all, this filled a void in my violent loving heart. Don't get me wrong, I can't stand violence in real life but this was pure fantasy. O, wouldn't it be lovely to get revenge on all those people who do you wrong? How it filled that void for me. If you don't have that desire, I suggest you look elsewhere. But if you want revenge, if you want to be absolutely positive that you will win no matter what, I think you will like this. Beautiful fight scenes,crazy characters, I can't wait to see the second one. I am so glad there is a someone out there that thinks like I do.
B000002JSP|4.0|After a three-year break, Led Zeppelin got back together again for 1979's &quot;In Through The Out Door,&quot; though this album would, unfortunately, prove to be their last, as Zeppelin &amp; their fans the world over were soon dealt the terrible news of drummer John Bonham's death from a drinking binge in 1980, leading to singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, and bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones announcing the breakup of the band. But &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot; is an excellent Zeppelin album, and a very strong one for the band to exit with (though that was obviously not the original intent). John Paul Jones brings his keyboards back to Zeppelin after a one-album hiatus (he was strictly on the bass for &quot;Presence&quot;) and plays them extensively, giving &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot; a more polished, radio-friendly feel than previous Zeppelin albums. Some fans were turned off, but they shouldn't have been, as I think Jones' keyboards simply enhance the music instead of detracts from it. As far as I'm concerned, Zeppelin STILL rock on &quot;In Through The Out Door.&quot; &quot;In The Evening&quot; is a classic full-throttle Zeppelin rocker. The piano-thumping &quot;South Bound Saurez&quot; is tremendous fun. &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot; is one of Zeppelin's more pop-oriented tracks--it was also released as a single--but it's very bouncy and catchy. &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; on the other hand, is not one of Zep's most popular songs, a sort of country/western pastiche that seems to totally come out of left field. But &quot;Hot Dog&quot; is what it is---Zeppelin having fun in the studio---and I enjoy the song on that level. &quot;Carouselambra&quot; is an epic 10 1/2 minute rocker that's simply astonishing from start to finish, with masterful flourishes and shifts in mood. &quot;All My Love&quot; is another pop-oriented number, but it's a gorgeous song, and one of Zeppelin's best-known tunes. Finally, there's the excellent &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl,&quot; a steady, powerful blues number. Robert Plant's vocals are terrific throughout, Jimmy Page delivers some more incredibly tasty guitar licks, John Paul Jones' bass-playing is solid and his keyboard-playing brilliant, and, in his final musical statement to the world, John Bonham contributes one last album's worth of exhilirating, powerhouse drumming, never to be duplicated by anyone. How very strange that Led Zeppelin named this album &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot;---certainly the band themselves did not plan to go &quot;in through the out door&quot; with this album, but with Bonham's unexpected passing, that is precisely what they did. The rock world lost another one of it's greatest bands, but these trailblazing gods of rock live on forever in their recorded work, plus in a few equally-mindblowing live albums as well, and &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot; is a terrific album for Led Zeppelin to take their final curtain call with. Farewell Led Zeppelin, and thank you for rockin' our worlds!
B00005JLYW|5.0|As a women I absolutely adored this movie.  First of all, I will NEVER understand why people expect movies to be like reality? Don't you know you are watching a movie? If you want reality~go outside. If you want pure fantasy A.K.A. movie, see this. It is fun!! I thought it was funny, I left the movies feeling really happy to be a women. So many movies make the women so helpless but this was really empowering. The action was GREAT, the FX was terrific! I left the movie remembering to buy the DVD. This movie was so cool, If you are cool you will love this movie. If you don't love this movie, then I guess you should get something more like yourself.
B00007LTIB|4.0|In 1974, keyboardist Rick Wakeman left Yes (the first of *many* comings and goings of Rick), as he wasn't happy with the group's direction on &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans,&quot; and decided to leave (but don't worry folks, he'll be back). In his absence, Yes recruited Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz (later of the Moody Blues), and together, they recorded &quot;Relayer.&quot; Featuring three epic songs, &quot;Relayer&quot; is a great Yes album, though the first piece, the 22-minute extravaganza &quot;The Gates Of Delerium,&quot; seems to overshadow the two shorter pieces that follow it. &quot;Delerium,&quot; a grand rock piece about war, is a signature Yes epic, with the band slowly building it up and building it up until it becomes a sonic battle, with each band member throwing in everything but the kitchen sink as the music builds into a frenzy. Finally, there's calm, and Jon Anderson steps in to sing the lament &quot;Soon,&quot; a hauntingly beautiful conclusion to an all-time Yes classic. And the next two pieces, the jazzy &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; and the concluding &quot;To Be Over,&quot; although they don't quite match up to &quot;Delerium&quot; in power, are still both excellent Yes songs in their own right. Filled with thunderous performances and moments of great beauty, &quot;Relayer&quot; is another fine Yes album.
B0001AP12G|5.0|First off this is one of the greatest hip hop albums ever.  Kanye shows that not only can he produce but he can rhyme.One of the best songs on this album is &quot;Get Em High,&quot; featuring Talib Kweli.  This song has a fluent rhythem, and sick lyrics from Kanye and Talib.  Also 2 Words featuring Mos Def and Freeway is a great song.  Kanye combines with Mos Def and Freeway to create one of the best songs of the year.  The best part of the album is all of the songs are produced by Kanye West. The only negative about this cd is the skits.  Most of them just take up time, and have absolute no meaning other then college doesnt do anything.  This album has made Kanye West one of my favorite artist/producer and HIP HOP Is BACK.  Get this Album
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Of all the many musicals made in the 30's through the 60's, there are only a few that I would consider to be truly classics (Singing In The Rain, Wizard of Oz, West Side Story) But, of all the classic musicals, Meet Me In St. Louis is at the top.<br />Since the storyline and extra's have already been reviewed many times I would like to comment on historical accuracy. As many of you may know, most movies made - especially in the 1940's and 1950's - skimp on historical accuracy. All that one has to do is to see the many westerns and WWII flicks that were released at the time. Not that those movies aren't entertaining or enjoyable, but let's face it, the main job of the director and producer was to put out pure entertainment and showcase their stars, with little regard for anything else. Meet Me In St. Louis also fits that description with one very big exception: Minnelli and company strove to give this movie as authentic a look as they possibly could. From the Victorian houses (inside and out - in the 40's and 50's virtually all who owned one of these historic beauties white washed the interior as to dispurse with the old fashioned wooden look for the new modern painted look), to the garish clothing, which one reviewer insinuated was not really worn by people at the turn of the century. Well, one look at an old Sears catalogue will show that, yes, women really did wear the clothing you see Judy and her fellow actors wearing. In fact,  it was from a 1903 Sears catalogue the the costumers got their information for the clothing worn in this movie. How accurate is that?<br />There are many other details to historical accuracy Minnelli and his troupe strived for, so much so that, as stated in the Making Of on disc two, this movie is like seeing a picture from the past come alive.<br />By the way, if you want to see just how people who owned these beautiful homes in the 50's and 60's nearly ruined the asthetic appearances of these Victorian homes, watch the 1966 pilot episode for TV included in this set and you'll see what I mean by white washing.<br />So, with all you have read in the many reviews here (the music, the storyline, the look and feel and historical accuracy, the extra's, the super high quality of the restoration, and the entertainment value), what are you waiting for? Get this movie!r TV included in this set and you'll see what I mean by white washing.<BR>So, with all you have read in the many reviews here (the music, the storyline, the look and feel and historical accuracy, the extra's, the super high quality of the restoration, and the entertainment value), what are you waiting for? Get this movie!
6300214435|5.0|I just had a brief comment to make on this film, which is more in the way of a fun piece of trivia for you movie trivia buffs out there like me rather than a full review.<br />Back when Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was being made, a young physicist went out to Skywalker Ranch to interview for an engineering job. Unfortunately I don't recall his name at this point, but anyway, when he arrived, they weren't ready to see him yet, so they said why don't you go into the mixing room and watch and see how it's done? So he went in and sat down.<br />Inside the audio engineer and an assistant were trying to mix the scene where the evil head priest is tearing the heart out of the guy's chest. To do the scene, they needed to get the schlurping noise of the victim's still beating heart, so the assistant had a big bucket that was filled with calamari and a big plunger that he was smushing the calamari with to try to create just the right noise effect. The engineer would run the tape and then have the guy go at the calamari with the toilet plunger. But it wouldn't be just right so he'd ask the guy to take it from the top again.<br />This went on for a while until the smell for the overripe calamari filled the room and the young physicist was getting nauseus. Finally, just when he thought he couldn't stand it anymore and was about to get up and leave the room, someone came in and said they were ready for the interview.<br />Well, the young physicist said there was a point to the story, too, which was that before Lucas built the first big all-digital studio that was used to create later movies, until then movies were very labor-intensive, even for seemingly little things like needing to produce the heart's beating noise. After that many things could be done on a computer, which vastly reduced the cost, especially as the price of computer equipment and software came down.<br />Anyway, I just thought I'd mention that for you movie trivia buffs since I hadn't heard that story before about the film before.y before about the film before.
B0001I55OC|3.0|Michael Crichton always tells two stories in his novels: a good story with strong characters, and a lot of scientific research.  His novels are usually two novels in one.  With TIMELINE, he spends a heck of a lot of time describing the quantum physics behind the time machine: cosmic foam, multi-universes, transcription errors.  It takes Crichton about 200 pages to describe all of this.  In the film, all of this is reduced to about 20 minutes.  The physics of the machine are reduced to a sort of &quot;Hey, it's a time machine and it works.&quot;  That's about all the quantum physics you're going to get in order to get in nearly an hour of battle sequences.<br />The thick Irish (or Scotish?) accents are also difficult to understand at first, especially since these characters carry most of the background information you need to understand why the scientists are building a time machine in the first place.<br />I would have been happy to settle for fewer battles and more explanation of the quantum mechanics in the beginning.  This is the true heart of the novel.  Without spending some time here, the movie just becomes a high-tech swashbuckler.  Also missing are the tensions and in-fighting of the executives of the technology company that built the machine.  Without this, the final sequence is denied any depth of meaning or irony.  <br />The DVD transfer is excellent.  The extras do go on a bit about the making of the movie. It turns into a sort-of &quot;let's pay endless homage to Richard Donner.&quot; The emphasis is on the technical side; the actors are not profiled in much depth. I was disappointed that there was no special feature on the quantum mechanics that Crichton built his story on.  <br />The movie is mind-candy, not mind-food, which is, after all, the real stuff of which classic science fiction books and movies are made of.
0790730960|5.0|If you like Batman then you must watch this.All of the characters are very interesting especially The Penguin.Of all the Tim Burton movies Ive seen this one remains my absolute favorite.Michelle Pfeiffer is the visually stunning Catwoman who has plenty of attitude and some severe emotional problems.Theres plenty of drama in this movie especially towards the end.The Penguin and Catwoman seem to get all the really good lines but I still love Christopher Walken as the delightfully creepy Max Shreck and also Michael Keaton as Batman.Out of all the Batman movies this one is the darkest and most dramatic and in my opinion the most entertaining even though the first was one of the best movies of the 80s.You should definitely see this.
B0001EBXBK|3.0|I have seen most of Quentin Tarantino's films, and can appreciate his twisted, artistic way of directing. I love the films Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction, both 2 great cult-classics. I thought this movie would be another classic but i was let down. <br />I love a good, gory film, but i think he went a bit overboard with all the decapitation, and limbs getting knocked off left, right, and center. Overall it had the same Quentin Tarantino style humour, and twisted characters. If you injoyed Bruce Lee type films this movie is for you, but if you were looking for another Reservoir Dogs, or Pulp Fiction, you might be disapointed.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Minor &quot;spoilers&quot; ahead - although you shouldn't care..<br />The Wachowski brothers have taken The Matrix - the most original sci-fi movie in many years - and in two movies made it into the worst, most cliched sci-fi trilogy ever. The first Matrix looked really cool and the faux-philosophy was kept to a minimum. Then the movie made millions and the writer/director brothers let it go to their heads. The second movie thought it was intelligent, but was really just a bunch of psycho-babble-jibberish and repetitive action sequences. The third movie manages to forever ruin the reputation of the franchise, as it is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie made me want to die in the cinema - except when I was laughing at the crap dialogue. Was I the only one who nearly died laughing when that stupid kid says he hasn't finished the training program?? THIS MOVIE SHOULD APPEAR IN THE DICTIONARY UNDER &quot;CLICHE&quot;. It should also be under &quot;annoying&quot; and &quot;plot-hole&quot; - I wanted that stupid general guy to die more than anything in the world, he kept getting angry when people did things to save the stupid city for god's sake! And what was with the Dragonball Z ending?!? Has Keanu become Goku as well as Jesus? Speaking of Jesus, the cross-shaped glow that emitted from Reeves at the end was pathetic - just like the ending. Maybe the W-Bros could have explicitly stated that you need to &quot;believe&quot; or &quot;have faith&quot; a few more time just to REALLY drive it home. At the end I expected to see a message thanking the church for funding. I won't even go into how this movie has unconvincing and over-used CGI, bad acting, every generic action movie plot point you've seen 100 times already and the worst soundtrack ever. I hated those stupid mechwarrior things, I hated all the characters, especially the stupid guy who you see screaming in his mech for about 10 minutes total and I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE. It really isterrible. If you liked the first Matrix and want to keep it that way, never come within 100 feet of &quot;Revolutions&quot;. This movie is a crime against humanity.
B000000OAA|5.0|I listened to this record many, many years ago when I was a  teenager. Still I can't stop listening to Queen and Sheer Heart Attack is my absolute favorite! There will never be a music band with that much perfection and entertainment - well, at least that's what I think! Hopefully my child will love them too :o)))
B00003CXHJ|2.0|That's right - don't be fooled by this revisionist film that lifts a few scenes straight out of the vastly superior &quot;Das Boot&quot;. I hate movies that decide to make history fit their stupid plots, and &quot;U-571&quot; is no exception. No Americans were involved in the seizure of the enigma code, and this movie will only serve to misinform many people. Aside from that, this is a decent action movie that steals from all submarine movies to preceed it. Also of note: Jon Bon Jovi's cameo is very funny.
B00000K19E|1.0|Theres no denieing the fact that somebody came up with a few new speichel effects and decided to quickly rush them into a movie. Apart from the effects which have been copeied and done to death so many times since this movie, this movie has absolutly no plot, no intrest, no point, and if this movie did not have the SFX shots that it does, no body would even have known what this movie was, except for the Keenu Reeve fans.<br />Purchase all 3 if you want to see some stunning visual FX but all based around a completly pointless, or, IF ANY plot at all. If the movie had plot ideas, it could have been somthing, but its highly given credit to, when every one cant denie its just the SFX that people are stunned by, not the plot.... watch the intro to that Olsen twins show if you wanna see the SFX from this movie! <br />Bottem line; Take away the FX, you have a bad movie!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Wow, talk about ruining a good thing. The first matrix was a fun, extremely cool-looking sci-fi film. This movie is a bloated mess that spends half of its time pretending it's the work of some brilliant philosopher and trying to be cool. I'm sorry, but I am sick of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity walking in formation, wearing sunglasses, making jerky head movements and looking pissed off. This movie was awful - Morpheus' address to the croud was predictable, lame, and somehow the catalyst for a twenty minute &quot;Club Zion&quot; dance scene which was crap in every sense of the word. All the business with the &quot;architect&quot; was perfectly satirized by Will Ferrrel on some awards show - he just kept yelling &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; and &quot;ergo&quot; over and over again. I expected this movie to be a disappointment, but not this big of one - even the fight sequences were boring. Still, it's significantly better than &quot;Revolutions&quot;, but I'd advise you never to watch either of them.
B000002H33|5.0|I thought somebody force-fed me cocaine or something the first time I heard this album.  Especially &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, a compositional miracle of riffage/momentum.  Nobody besides Rush and Pantera ever came close to this combination of force and pulse, where you just feel part of the metal. <br />So after all these years I appreciate all the other songs all the more, particularly &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;.  I think Lars, James and Cliff just tapped into some cosmic force, on top of which Kirk could shred properly (and back then he really did).  &quot;And Justice for All ...&quot; comes close at times, as does the antecedent &quot;Ride&quot;, but for my money this IS the Desert Island disc with which to small all the other desert island discs.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I first became interested in this album because of 2 songs I had heard by Blink on the radio and these were &quot;All The Small Things&quot; and &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot;.<br />I love these songs - they're ulitmate punk feel good songs. The words are so funny and they both have excellent videos. When you hear these songs you just wanna get up and dance.<br />However, as good as these songs are, I think there's one song that outshines them, and that is &quot;Adam's Song.&quot; I can't describe this song - I just don't know how. It's a totally amazing song with a great tune and such good words.<br />It's different from a lot of their stuff on this album, it's deeper. It goes more into feelings and emotions. Being a teenager, I can really relate with it. So what if these guys are in their twenties, this album is perfect for teens.<br />With upbeat energetic songs and some that really hit home, this album is perfect for any teenager. Being an old album now, it's gonna be cheaper. But it's worth a hell of a lot more than what you're gonna pay for it, trust me.
6305428522|5.0|The first era of prime-time television programming was the Vaudeo Era, which was defined by shows like &quot;The Texaco Star Theater&quot; with Milton Berle, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; with Sid Caesar, and &quot;I Love Lucy.&quot;  However, during the Fifties television underwent monumental changes in terms of how shows were produced.  There are two specific programs that represent the major changes.  One is &quot;Dragnet,&quot; which was the first successful series that was filmed in Hollywood and represented the shift away from live television broadcast from New York.  The other is the CBS game show &quot;Dotto,&quot; which was the first such show to be exposed as being rigged in 1958.  It was not as successful as &quot;The $64,000 Question,&quot; which was apparently run cleanly, or as infamous as &quot;Twenty-One,&quot; which is the basis for the 1994 film &quot;Quiz Show,&quot; but it was first.  Because the quiz show scandal was driven by the greed of corporate sponsors, networks then began the practice of selling advertising time.  No longer would a sponsor, such as Geritol, be able to decide what programs would go on the air.<br />However, Robert Redford's film is not really about the massive changes in the business of television that resulted from the quiz show scandals.  The final word in this film is given to Dan Enright (David Paymer), the producer of &quot;Twenty-One,&quot; who insists that because the show was entertainment and everybody made money, there was nothing wrong with giving contestants the answers and rigging the game.  The point of this film is the human wreckage left behind by the scandal in terms of the two &quot;Twenty-One&quot; contestants at the center of the storm.  Herbie Stempel (John Turturro) and Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) are polar opposites in terms of looks and religion but what they have in common is a vast knowledge of what can be called facts or trivia depending on your point of view.  As Van Doren's father observes, if you are going to ask a question worth $64,000 it should be about the meaning of life.<br />Stempel is the reigning champion on &quot;Twenty-One,&quot; but the show's sponsor (Martin Scorsese) has grown tired of Stempel's looks and grating personality.  So the producers order him to take a dive and in a calculated move that backfires on them insist that Stempel blow an easy question on what film won the Oscar for best picture in 1955.  Enright thinks that for 70 grand Stempel can be humiliated, but the producer grossly underestimates the importance of a reputation for being a smart guy has to someone like Stempel.  The producers also think they have the perfect replacement for Stempel in Van Doren, the son of a famous American intellectual family.  They offer to feed him the answers to ensure victory, but when Van Doren refuses they go ahead and find a slightly different way of producing the same results.  Van Doren blinks, but takes the money, and sales for Geritol go up fifty percent.<br />Between these two is Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), a young lawyer who works for the Senate committee with oversight responsibilities on television.  Goodwin is Jewish like Stempel but also Ivy League like Van Doren, and while he is pursuing the truth regarding how &quot;Twenty-One&quot; is run he is also attracted to the life lived by Van Doren, who exchanges Shakespeare quotations with his poet father Mark (Paul Schofield) over a family lunch.  The great irony of the script by Paul Attanasion, based on Goodwin's book &quot;Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties,&quot; is that Stempel wants to get &quot;Twenty-One&quot; and Goodwin wants to get television, and while neither wants to do it with Van Doren, that becomes unavoidable.  Not that any of these three men comes close to getting what they want out of this experience.<br />It is impossible not to consider &quot;Quiz Show&quot; to be a morality play, but as such it is a rather disheartening one since nobody gets what they deserve at the end of this one.  But Redford sees the quiz show scandals as being a point in American history that ended a period of innocence.  After this point Americans could not longer believe what they saw on television as being the truth and Redford, who did star in &quot;All the President's Men,&quot; sees it as the first in a series of violations of the public trust that extend through Vietnam, Watergate and beyond.  But the performances by Turturro and Finnes are so compelling that they keep this film grounded on the personal level, so that the larger social issues are lost in the personal wreckage of Stempel and Van Doren's lives.  Enright claims that nobody lost with these quiz shows, but that is obviously not the case.<br />My only complaint about this film is that it really does not do a good job of capturing the excitement of such shows.  Stempel and Van Doren played each other four times before Van Doren became the new champion.  Van Doren also played Vivienne Nearing three times to a tie before losing (and had beaten her husband Victor earlier that year).  I do not think we get a sense of the drama or the addictive nature of the game.  Fortunately, it was only a few years after this film that game shows made it back to prime time with &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&quot;  With that show we could really appreciate what it was like for the country to be riveted by a game show.  Ironically, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was brought back, but it did not catch on.at they deserve at the end of this one.

B000002NJS|5.0|This is definitely a ray of light to my CD collection. It's adventurous and atmospheric - definitely a great work.<br />There are no low points to the album, every song is beautiful in its own way.<br />This album is very well thought of, which is no surprise to me. It's a great work, very forward-thinking and definitely one of Madonna's best. If you are a fan of Madonna, or even if you're not, you should listen to this album. Simply amazing.

0061015725|4.0|As is par for the course in Crichton novels, human beings have created a new advance in science/technology without seriously pondering the consequences. This time the culprit is nanotechnology; microcomputers with a malevolent will of their own. <br />Crichton does a good job of throwing together a mix of different characters and the relationships/tensions between them. It was this very tension that compelled me to keep turning the pages. The science is fascinating too. Most of us are familar with the menacing image of the &quot;Terminator&quot; cyborgs which are machines that are bigger and stronger than humans. In this case though, humans are pitted against machines that are microscopic, yet still pose an existential threat to humanity. Crichton's description of the behavior of the machines relative to humans as predator/prey always made me feel like the humans were being stalked and hunted and kept the pace of the book moving briskly.<br />A few years back I read an article in the Los Angeles Times by Bill Joy, Chief Science Officer at Sun Microsystems, about the advances and dangers in nanotechnology. Prey is a book that illustrates those dangers in vivid fashion and should gives us pause to question the wisdom of rushing forward with computer technology at breakneck speed without adequate deliberation.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|As you probably know, Guns N Roses only released 4 real studio albums. The last one &quot;The Spagetthi Incident&quot; was actually a collection of punk covers.<BR> Because of this fact, my opinion is that this Greatest Hits is not neccesary to buy! If you like GNR, it is probably a much better idea to get Appetite for Destruction first, and then buy the two Use your Illusion-albums. If you want even more, buy the GNR Lies. Finally if you want to complete the collection, get Spagetthi Incident and the Live Era-double.<BR> This is a much better thing to do, because GNR actually didnt have a single bad song on the four &quot;real&quot; albums. Every single one was a masterpiece on its own, and this way you will get them all, instead of only a few. <BR>This &quot;Greatest hits&quot; isnt actally &quot;the greatest&quot;, either, because it leaves out one of the most intellectual rock-anthems ever written: &quot;Estranged&quot;.
B00007AJGH|5.0|1987's &quot;marriage&quot; of animation and live action still holds up quite well due to the performances of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and the vocal skills of Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. The DVD offers the fan everything that he/she wants to know about the making of the movie.<br />The only complaint that I could register would be in the first disc's compilation of the three theatrical Roger Rabbit &quot;shorts&quot;. Viewing them back to back reveals their shortcomings. While it is obvious that Zemeckis and company were paying homage to the great Tex Avery 'toons of the thirties, forties, and fifties, these newer films lacked Avery's brilliant over-the-top &quot;bite.&quot; Avery had a lunacy unlike any other director of animated films and he couldn't be imitated.<br />I know Avery and Zemeckis is no Avery.
0140288503|5.0|Writing about battles in a manner than makes the reader feel involved is more the genre of fiction than non-fiction. Mark Bowden accomplishes the extraordinarily difficult by accurately recounting the story of a brutal, desperate battle in a way that puts you right in the middle of the fight. The often overlooked battle of Mogadischu has been ignored or downplayed by many. It is to Bowden's great credit that he pulled back the curtain on this brave but ultimately futile action that many in the political sector were only too willing to keep hidden.<br />Bowden puts you in the helicopters beside the Rangers and Delta operators as they plunge into a routine mission gone terribly wrong. You sense the awful loss as comrades are killed or wounded and the helplessness of a small group of elite soldiers who are suddenly confronted by a guerrilla army of thousands in a dusty, dark, stinking pesthole on the Horn of Africa.<br />You share the bravery, loyalty and skill of these soldiers and you will weep over their loss. Even more troubling, you will recognize the utter waste when a vacillating and spineless political leadership abruptly yanks them out of Somalia on the verge of achieving the impossible goal - removal of 'General' Adid that the politicians had set in the first place.<br />That weakness of moral core was startling enough to give Osama bin Laden - present at the time in Somalia - the motivation to press his attack on the United States. The road to the attack on 9-11 begins on the Mogadishu Mile.<br />This is an important book from many points: to demonstrate the amazing character of the American soldier, to point out the ability of the US to carry out extremely difficult missions, and most of all to demonstrate the absolute necessity of having high level political backing for any commitment of military resources. Black Hawk Down has to be a part of any serious reader's library.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I listened to this CD in the car ride home last week. I love Toxic, I never seem to tire of it. I think it is the best song she's recorded since the Drive Me Crazy song. It was written by Cathy Dennis, who was popular in the 90's for her catchy danceable tunes.
0679411585|5.0|American soldiers in Vietnam were similar to American soldiers in wars prior and since. They fought with dedication, loyalty and skill. They were motivated, well led and informed. They knew for what they were fighting and why and recognized the importance of their contribution and sacrifice. Yet the popular mythology is very different.<br />General Moore and correspondent Galloway have made an invaluable contribution to the truth by publishing this most unusual joint memoir - how often do soldiers and journalists team up? Together they have produced one of the classic battle books of all times. Though written in a self-deprecating manner it is impossible to read this excellent book and not be completely in awe of the leadership abilities and dedication of then Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore.<br />Moore took his new battalion - then an experimental airmobile unit - into what turned out to be an incredibly one-sided battle against seasoned, tough North Vietnamese regular forces. The Americans won that battle due in part to their supporting air and artillery but mostly on the shoulders of the soldiers and their leaders, from Colonel Moore all the way down to the squad and fire teams.<br />We Were Soldiers goes a long way to restoring the rightful pride that Americans ought to feel about our soldiers in Vietnam. This is a book that belongs on every American's shelf and is one that you will want to go back to and contemplate from time to time. It is an absolute must read.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Kill Bill, Volume 1 started was filled with a lot of energy, and Quentin Tarantino, seeing how it was his movie, definitely left his 'better' marks on it.  However, I could not fully get into the movie.  I know that Kill Bill is a homage to old Asian fighting movies, and spaghetti westerns, and in that light the movie flows, but from an average viewer standpoint who probably has not seen too many of those, it just is a lot of fighting with a lot, and a lot, of fake overdone bloody scenes.  Now, if you like Quentin then you will probably like this movie, because it is done in a very creative, yet still Quentin style.  I guess, the movie overall is okay, especially since they had the time to put in a creative anime sequence, but I still did not think too highly of the movie overall.
074325144X|5.0|I have taken the author's ChiRunning workshop (which was outstanding), and this book details everything he talked about in the workshop, and a lot more on top of that -- plus, I have the book to refer to at my leisure.<br />The techniques for running the author describes are impeccable, because the physics behind them are impeccable.  The discussions, diagrams, and photographs are detailed and specific.  The metaphysics... they work for the author, and if they work for you, so much the better, but even if they don't, the material in the book will be directly applicable to any fitness runner, racer, triathlete, or sportsperson.<br />When I started doing ChiRunning I acheived *faster*, *easier* running, lower incidence of soreness and no incidence of injury, and feeling better during and after runs.  I cannot expect more from a book on running, and have gotten *less*, from several books.
B00005JLYW|2.0|I found this movie lame......... it was poorly thought out and had no point. Maybe becaouse I dont remember the first movie that well I thought this was was just awfull. I dont think i cared for the first one either. Best part of the movie is when pink apeared and that is the only reason iam giving it to stars what a knock out
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce.  Need I say more?  Always incredibly bootylicious!
B00005JKZV|3.0|Okay I love these movies dont get me wrong but I dont think this deserves a 5 star rating neither do any of the other. They are nothing like the book Sam jackson butchord the story. It would have been great if he had called it a remaging instead of lord of the rings. How can any one who has read all 4 books and I do not mean audio books. Even say these movies are close to the book dont get me wrong i loved them and I own them all but not worth a 5 star
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I've always had healthy respect for the woman.  Growing up in Canada and its quota of a certain amount of radioplay being Canadian, Sarah McLachlan was quite often played, and since her musical tastes partly shaped mine, I was always naturally happy to hear her songs.  From the hushed sentiments of Angel to the psychoticness of Sweet Surrender to even the sometimes absurdedness of Ice Cream, the woman's just bursting with talent.  Her albums, though short, are always filled to the brim with quality, and that's what's great about her.  Short yet exquisite.<br />Unfortunately, her long awaited album, Afterglow, doesn't follow in the footsteps of her past albums.  Make no mistake, it's certainly not horrificly bad, but it's certainly a disappointment for someone who has been able to consistently put out such great music.  Nothing on this album is remotely as good as her previous stuff, save for possibly World on Fire and her single, Fallen.  Most of the album sounds the same, blending together like one gigantic 40 minute long drone, with lyrics all dealing with falling, or letting go, or something to that degree.  The effect is to say the least, repetitive and asinine, making it difficult for the listener to feel or to empathise with this effort.  Its almost too perfect and glossy production by Pierre Marchand almost threatens to drown out her pretty voice, and that wall effect that they employ, is used too much here, making it sound almost fake and synthetic.  As a result, the quality of her voice, another key point of her style, is threatened, making this work less that excellent.<br />While I would consider myself a fan of her work, I don't believe that this is to the full extent of her abilities.  She has much more potential, of which she partially tapped in the early-middle section of her career, with Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, and to a degree I suppose, Surfacing.  The blandness of this album, not the songs or prettiness, unfortunately stands out too prominently here.<br />As for pricing, for Canadians, you can find it cheaper at Amazon.ca or buy it at Future Shop, both for $12.99 CDN.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This newest \\"Peter Pan,\\" faithful to the original play/book, succeeds in being a very amusing adventure tale throughout.  That, you can be assured.  But what distinguishes this one from many others (possibly Disney's) is its serious undertone.  You should remember the fact that J. M. Barrie as a child lost his elder brother, and the sad memory is the basis of the story.  A boy lives young forever because he is not living here anymore.  This film does not miss that point, which is a great thing indeed.<br />The famous story is basically the same as before, so there is no need to repeat it now.  Wendy meets Peter Pan (who is played by a male actor for the first time n English-speaking films) and goes to the Neverland.  Peter Pan is played by Jeremy Sumpter (\\"Frailty\\") while Wendy by Rachel Hurd-Wood who auditioned for the role, with no previous acting experience.  Don't worry, they are so natural and engaging that you come to believe that the casting is not wrong.  And it is not.<br />Adventure is all around, with fearsome Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs, the baddie in \\"Patriot\\") and his pirates.  Though they are treated in the slightly comic light, the truth is, they, especially the captain, are a bunch of cruel guys who really enjoy watching people walk on the board and dive into the sea, and the sword-fight scenes remind you of the fact.  They are exciting, and dangeroues at the same time, and when Captain kills, he kills as if it is nothing.    <br />Tinker Bell (lovely French Lodivine Sagner, regular of Francis Ozon) and other characters appear as they should, with superb acting.  The fine CGIs work to help their characters, helped by the power of imagination who use them even though some would prefer, understandably, Peter Pan flying with wire attached to his body.<br />The greatest thing about this \\"Peter Pan\\" is, however, that it does not forget the flip side of being forever young.  At the end of the film, director P. J. Hogan (\\"Best Friends' Wedding\\") gives us atouching moment -- touching because it shows sadness of being Peter Pan.  It's sweet all the same, but after all \\"Peter Pan\\" is about something we lost on the way to the adulthood.  And this film's conclusion never misses the point.<br />Imagine the lush and lavish images of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" or Leo's \\"Romeo & Juliet,\\" and you get a picture of uniquely beautiful \\"Peter Pan.\\"  (The photography is by Donald M. McAlpine, who was behind the camera in these two films.)  Ans under its beautiful pictures, this film has a heart.
B00005K9QP|5.0|It is insane how someone at the tender age of 20 would deliver the kind of guitar playing Eric Clapton left behind in his last recording with John Mayall's Blues Breakers! It is so extraordinary, that 40+ years after we're still talking about the man as \\"God\\". 'Bluesbreakers With Eric Clapton' is one of those impeccable albums where you only regret that the songs were so short due in part to the limitations that the 45 RPM albums imposed on artists. The downtempo blues \\"Have you heard\\" luckily escapes this prison of time constraints, to liberate all the tearing energy that \\"slowhand\\" had inside, leaving with us a recording that will never become dated.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you have an open mind and are not afraid to give things a go this film will leave you speechless. The animation is simply beautiful, the music is fantastic, and the story is completely unlike anything you will have ever seen before -<BR>Personally I recommend the Japanese speech version as I found it less childish, but nevertheless the English dubbing is very well done. Also the 2 disc set with special features is a much more complete package and well worth the extra few quid. <BR>Go on, give it a go! Live a little!<BR>I dare you to try Miyazaki's Spirited Away and not love it!
B00012QM8G|5.0|..... and stop whining endlessly about the quality of your material goods. It's highly ironic that you're meant to be reviewing a film that spends 3 hours showing you that you're lucky to be alive and free, and the only thing some of you are doing is criticising the packaging of the DVD. God forbid you should have to get out of your recliner and flip the dvd over half way through. Talk about missing the point! Geez!
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater is definatly my favorite band so this review might be a little bias. If you never listened to them before give them a chance, even if you don't like the music you can appreciate the talent in the band. I have talked to a lot of people and most say it is too hard to listen too because too many things are going on at once, but they still respect their talent. Everyone says the singer sucks and that is the only thing they don't like about the band but I really like the singer. His vocals are over the top just like everyone else in the band so he fits in perfectly. Give them a try  because I am glad I gave them a chance and now they havea special place in my heart. Thanks JP,MP,JL,JM and JR.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Let me tell you flat out, I like this cd.  It's brutally heavy, it's creative, and I love Petrucci's guitar solos.  He's still one of the best guitar players I know of.  However, as a relatively new fan of Dream Theater, I can see why people who have been listening to them for awhile would dislike it.<br />First of all, it doesn't really sound like Dream Theater was as creative on this cd as opposed to their earlier efforts.  Basically, there's nothing special about this one.  Images and Words and Scenes From A Memory had a lot more substance and inspiration.  In this one, Dream Theater sacrifices a lot of creativity for all that crazy heaviness.  Not that there's anything wrong with that...it's just that I know Dream Theater is capable of doing a lot more than this.  I mean, c'mon, the first song kinda sounds like a Metallica song.  I noticed a couple other bands' sounds in there too, but I have failed to figure out who they are.  Oh, and as always, I cannot stand James LaBrie's voice.  I personally believe that he does not belong in this band.  Especially now that they're so much heavier.  He sounded a lot better on Scenes From A Memory.<br />I'm not trying to scare anyone away from this cd.  If you're a Dream Theater fan of a long time, you might not like this change.  However, if you're like me and just like it for what it is...then go for it!  Stand out songs are Stream of Conciousness and In the Name of God.  Those songs get repeated play on my stereo at full volume.  Anyway, have fun with this cd!
B00000IIXH|3.0|As everyone else has pointed out, there are three 'new' tracks here unavailable anywhere else. This has led many to accuse Bruce of ripping off his fans (with many recalling a similar sentiment surrounding the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD from 1995, which was also padded out with 4 'new' tracks).<br />It's a real shame the three tracks were not included in the box set (there's more than enough room on each of the four discs on &quot;Tracks&quot;), but Bruce did not have any sinister motive saving them for this sampler CD. One thing to consider was that Springsteen's people were rushed to complete this set. According to a detailed article in Mix Magazine, Springsteen, Landau, and his team of engineers were working at their own pace when Sony got wind that the project was under way. All of a sudden, a huge marketing campaign was begun and a three-month timetable landed on Springsteen's lap. An insane amount of coordination and work was done to meet the deadline. At one point, they had roughly 120 to 130 tracks in consideration, eventually whittled down to 66, and I wouldn't be surprised if the rush had some impact on their decision-making.<br />When the box set finally came out, many, including Charlie Rose who interviewed Springsteen on his own show regarding &quot;Tracks,&quot; asked about &quot;The Fever&quot; and &quot;The Promise.&quot; Springsteen said that &quot;The Fever&quot; was never one of his favorites, and as much as he liked &quot;The Promise,&quot; none of the recordings did it justice (none of this was new information or a big secret to longtime Springsteen fans). Well, the complaints were universal, and since there was already talk of a one disc sampler for the budget-minded fan (which eventually became &quot;18 Tracks&quot;), Springsteen thought he could use that disc as a way of appeasing fans. So, his engineers retrieved and remixed &quot;The Fever&quot; for CD release, and because he was never satisfied with the old recordings, went back into thestudio and recorded a solo, piano rendition of &quot;The Promise&quot; in 1999 (months after &quot;Tracks&quot; was already released). How &quot;Trouble River&quot; figured into the mix, I'm not sure, but he was set on putting two new tracks on the disc, so why not a third?<br />Of course, lots of fans already picked up the box set the month it came out, so even though Bruce was sympathetic to what he heard afterwards, you can understand why so many would still cry rip-off. But, 1) again, Bruce didn't do this to squeeze money out of his fans, he did it because he was trying to appease them. 2) you'll notice on Amazon, ebay, and many other sites that &quot;18 Tracks&quot; used goes for a paltry few dollars, the price of a CD single or a 45, so time has righted things for those who have yet to buy it.<br />As for the 15 cuts taken from the box set, they aren't the 15 best. I actually like all of them, but &quot;Thundercrack,&quot; &quot;Roulette,&quot; &quot;Shut Out The Light,&quot; and &quot;The Wish&quot; among others are more essential than &quot;Where the Bands Are,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be with You,&quot; &quot;Lion's Den,&quot; and &quot;Part Man, Part Monkey.&quot;<br />Unless you're strapped for cash, go for the box set. For those who have the box set and are considering buying this for the new material, don't pay full price, get a cheap, used copy, they should be easy to find.
B000003TA2|5.0|I don't own this cd, i plan on buying it very soon cos i have mp3s of dirty boots and tunic and theyre both amazing but Chris Robertson, your interpretation of Tunic is so, so, so, so, so, so wrong. The song is about the life, death and heavenly ascension of the anorexic Karen Carpenter (true story). hence: &quot;i feel like i'm disappearing&quot; and &quot;you said: 'you look so under-fed'&quot;. brilliant song though
B000024D4R|4.0|Aside from Umma gumma, this is the oddest Pink Floyd album.  It rocks alot harder than alot they have done, which is what distinquishes it from the rest.  Also, this is the first Pink Floyd album that goes beyond having a huge theme and has a coherent story.<br />Pigs on the wing- A nice acoustic number, some of Roger's cleanest singing.<br />Dogs- Out of all the songs here, this is the most distinctly floydian.  Smooth singing by gilmore, face melting guitar solos, I have no idea how the hell he gets all of those sounds.<br />Pigs (three kinds of em)-  I just love the bit about Whitehouse, some of my favorite lyrics here and probably my favorite song on this album.  Catchy, infectious melody.<br />Sheep- powerful, and rockin.  The &quot;biblical&quot; recitation here is rather entertaining.  Although I wish I could get my hands on &quot;raving and drooling&quot;
B00003CXCT|5.0|Everyone needs to get off their soap box and be quite. We have ALL been waiting for Lucas to get off is rear end and release the first three movies on DVD. Let's cut out the crap about one release being better or worse then the other. They are ALL great in their own right. I for one think this DVD release is simply awesome. The interviews are excellent and the picture and sound can't be beat. <br />Now lets all of us put our little opinions down and be thankful that they are finally availbale on DVD. After all it is the world of Star Wars we all love to watch. And these movies are fun to watch as well. This is a GREAT BUY for any collector.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|i'm writing this review because when i looked at the reviews on this page i saw alot of them that bassically said that this movie was boring and that they didn't get it. <BR>yes. this movie is boring if you need alot of dialouge or a loud explosion every couple of minutes to keep you awake during a movie. but this is one of the best and most well crafted films i have ever seen. Two married strangers are bassically stranded in Tokyo and fall in love almost by accident. The ending is perfect for the film. Many people say it doesn't resolve anything and that it's unclear, but that's the point. It leaves you feeling weirdly comforted and you can't figure out why. <BR>Just watch the movie. you might love it and you might hate it. but it is most definatly worth the risk.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Please take some advice from a huge sci-fi / action film fan, and in particular, a huge fan of the original Matrix film. The first Matrix rocked - an amazingly original storyline, great dialogue and a great blend of sci-fi with martial arts. Not this time. This final sequel, Matrix Revolutions, is garbage - basically a souless two hour video game cut-scene. It has a lousy, confusing script with too much emphahsis on over-blown-budget visuals. This is one of the the worst movies I have ever paid money to see. The storyline stinks and the stupid, ambivilent ending is an absolute insult to fans of the original film. The Wachowski Brothers and Warner Brothers' over-meddling producers are living proof that lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Don't waste your money again - I sure won't.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|Special effects with no real plot! The Matrix with vampires and werewolves.
B00005JM20|4.0|Johnny English is a great movie.  It's about a secret agent who's name is Johnny English, who also teams up with a guy called Buff.  They are trying to see who stole the queen of englands crown and jewls.  They figure out who it was pretty fast and the bad guy wants to become the king of England!  it is a great family movie.  My only neggative is they didn't do a good job of rating it.  This movie is rated PG and it should be rated PG13 at least because at the end you see someones private for about 20 seconds.  Other then that it's a great family movie.
0385510438|3.0|This book is like a donut, it doesn't have a middle. What it does have are the kinds of characters you have come to expect from a Grisham novel set in the south: hard drinking lawyers, corrupt cops and bad guys.<br />The plot is pretty basic. A horrible rape and murder takes place. The bad guy is apprehended and sent away for a couple of years, then he gets out and jury members start dropping over dead. The problem is the ten years in between. Grisham fills this void with his social commentary on the Vietnam War, race relations and the rest.<br />Willie, the main character and accidental newspaper editor comes of age during the time. The story moves along like a rudderless ship on a calm sea.<br />Most of us buy his books hoping to read another Rainmaker or the Firm or the Testament. <br />This book was probably an effort to write. It certainly was an effort to read.

0316666343|5.0|This is a gripping and moving novel that took hold of my emotions, ripped them out of my body and left them dangling in front of me for review. By this I mean, I cried, I had bad dreams, and I experienced pain I hadn't felt in years; pain I thought I had conquered.<br />I lost a loved one years ago. He was not a child. He was not murdered.  In fact, he died of natural causes. It was in no way similar to the story of this novel. But, Alice Sebold moved me nonetheless, and in a way no other author has before. <br />Feelings I had not explored in years were brought to surface. Only a powerful book could do that after so many years of careful protection and suppression of these particular emotions.<br />If you have lost a loved one recently, I caution you to approach this book only when you are ready to deal with it.  I do not think I could have read this too soon after experiencing the death of someone close to me.<br />That said, this is a beautiful book. Well worth the read.<br />If you are a pragmatist and do not enjoy concepts of the supernatural or spiritual, you may not like this book. However,I still think it is worth a look. You never know which raw nerves may be hit and how you may grow from it.
B00005JMSE|5.0|This is one of the more original movies that I have seen in<br />quite some time.Hellboy was originally a comic book hero.He is<br />called in from the dark side by Rasputin and the Nazis.He is a<br />baby devil,red,with horns and a tail,and an armored right arm.<br />Instead of becoming a tool of evil he is raised by the professor<br />who raises him to be a good guy.He fights monsters while smoking cigars,drinking Bud light,and showing a very good sense of humor.<br />He has a fish man and a pyrotechnic woman as partners.Rasputin<br />returns to the scene with some very evil monsters.Hellboy and<br />Rasputin have a final showdon in Russia.This is an outstanding movie that has some unique villians and heros.The scenery and special effects are outstanding as well.See this movie,you will enjoy it.
0440238609|5.0|I didn't think there was another fantasy series that could compare with ones like Narnia or Harry Potter, but I was very impressed with these books and couldn't put them down.  They're great because the fantasy world is convincing and you fall in love with the characters.  Lyra is one of the strongest little-girl characters I've ever heard of, which is reason enough for little girls to read it, I suppose. (and everyone else!)<BR>The Golden Compass is my favourite of the trilogy, but thank goodness there was more to read! The Amber Spyglass wraps up the trilogy in a moving way. <BR>I would reccomend picking up the first book and seeing if you get hooked!
B000021Y7X|5.0|I first saw this at a party and was just blown away.  Afterwords I figured that the movie was so great because I was drunk and there were a lot of cannabanoid molecules in the atmosphere.  However, I saw the DVD again when I was of a completely straight mind and the affect was the exact same.  I was just as mesmorized by the music and movements of David Byrne as I was at the party.  <br />This is no mere concert, it is the best piece of musical entertainment ever filmed.  I say that because I wasn't too found of the parts of Woodstock where the camera would focus on the audience for long periods of time (except when the women were bathing) where as, while you certainly are aware of it, the audience is never visually acknowlledged in Stop Making Sence so there is no doubt that you don't miss any action.<br />If you haven't experienced it then do so.  Though, if by some miracle you don't like it, make sure you don't pass that judgement before you see Life During Wartime (obviously my personal favorite).<br />What else can be said?
B00013F38K|3.0|I was 11, and I loved this series.  I love it now, at 43.  A gentle man tries to survive while doing as little damage as possible, and sometimes offering a bit of help.  However skillfully written or choreographed the episodes were, the central message of kindness remained.  I see many flaws today that I didn't at age 11, but who cares?  Caine was one of my most beloved teachers.  That will never change.<br />I subtract TWO STARS for the cropping.  I swear it did not even occur to me to look at the box for the ratio!  Who on earth would crop a TV show?  Listen, I always check the ratio on films, and I was in the vanguard of widescreen proponents, in the 80's when no one gave a damn about it.  But the whole point is to RETAIN INFORMATION, to avoid destruction of the artist's creation.  Somebody decided Kung Fu did not deserve that much respect.  They were wrong.<br />So I have mixed feelings.  I'm sorry I bought the tattered version, but I have watched a few episodes and they made me as happy as they did in 1972.  Clean look, clean sound.  If you love this series, buy it and enjoy it.  But I am still hoping for an untattered version.  If they produce that, I will buy it instantly, and give the widescreen version to an 11 year old.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This is actually the first Star Trek: The Next Generation film that I've found thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. Both GENERATIONS and FIRST CONTACT had significant instances where their plots seemed either outrageously unlikely (a Borg &quot;queen?&quot;) or else outright contradictory (see Scotty's comments when he's discovered in &quot;Relics.&quot;) with the television series. INSURRECTION, although lacking the flaws of the earlier two films, watched - at best - like an overly-long episode of the show. NEMESIS, however, is noticeably free from these flaws.<br />The very act of featuring Romulans as the enemy in NEMESIS gives us a refreshing break from the now rather tired Federation/Klingon or Federation/Borg tensions that have dominated virtually all Star Trek feature films. On top of that, Shinzon is a three-dimensional villain. He isn't simply an incarnation of pure evil like the Borg Queen or Malcom McDowell's self-involved Dr. Soran. He's portrayed as a victim of his circumstances, with human weaknesses and curiosity.<br />As with drama, NEMESIS does exceedingly well with its comedic elements. It leaves behind the virtually slap-stick comedy of GENERATIONS (Data's repugnant &quot;emotion chip&quot;) and FIRST CONTACT (James Cromwell's drunken Zephram Cochrane.) Instead, NEMESIS opts for a more sophisticated comedic tone. The crew enjoy a realistic camaraderie, poking fun at each other and dropping the occasional sarcastic comment without resorting to vulgarities.<br />Finally, the special effects and requisite battle scenes are most definitely well done. I frequently found myself anticipating most of the action in previous TNG films. NEMESIS, however, was full of pleasant surprises.<br />Overall, I think this is hands-down the best Next Generation film to date. It's funny, it's exciting and it's touching. It has, in fact, all the elements of good &quot;space drama,&quot; and they're executed perfectly.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|I've been alive a short time on this earth, and have heard only a small amount of the music that humans have pumped into the ears of the masses, but I have this to say: I know what I like and I know what turns me on. EODM turns me right on. Pick it up in whatever capacity you can, mp3, cd, whatever, because you'd be missing out otherwise.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I had been very disappointed with the second movie in the series &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot; so much so that I ended up skipping this third &quot;Matrix Revolutions&quot; when it was released in the theaters.  The first &quot;The Matrix&quot; movie had been so intriguing, original, and such a perfect sci-fi movie to me that the bar had been raised very high for this trilogy movie series.<br />As a stand alone movie the first Matrix movie cannot be surpassed but I can see now that if you combined all three movies that the second one doesn't look as bad nor as incomplete as it seemed to be and more importantly this third movie actually exceeded my expectations.  If you are looking for the interesting plot thick suspense of the first movie then Revolutions is not going to satisfy you. But if you are looking for a sci-fi thriller with over the top special effects and enough story to hold your interest then this movie will definitely entertain.<br />I bought this DVD not expecting much from it and now my only regret is that I didn't go to the theaters to see it on the big screen.  There are some truly stunning scenes in this movie with my favorites being those showing the &quot;machines&quot; attack on the human's subterranean city.  This third movie pushes the special effects to a GRAND SCALE.  If you like these kind of movies with massive battles reminiscent of Star Wars movies then you will love this movie.  The Revolutions story line is not as deep, not as believable, not as complex, nor is it as thought provoking as the first movie but there is enough there to hold your interest unlike the second movie's lack of a solid story line where I could not wait for it to end.<br />Although I think that owning the first Matrix DVD on its own may be enough for most of us, if you don't have the first or second movie on DVD then I would recommend you simply wait for the complete DVD trilogy to be released since I think all three movies seen in sequence would be the preferred way of viewing  and owning the Matrix series. In conclusion I rated the first &quot;The Matrix&quot; with five stars, the second movie &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot; got two stars and this movie &quot;The Matrix Revoltions&quot; gets four stars.
B0001907DA|4.0|Not going to spend any time here reviewing the movies, we all know what they're like.  I just wanted to say to the folks complaining that the films do not accurately portray actual Police Academies have missed the point completely:  In the first minute of the first movie, the titles state very plainly that the new mayor has done away with all restrictions on applicants to the Police Academy.  Absolutely no one could be turned away.  Fat, weak, dumb, short, timid, crazy, old... anyone was eligable.  The point of the movies -- if they have a point -- is that &quot;this&quot; is what happens when you indiscriminately let just anybody off the street in the Academy.  I guess after 7 movies some people forgot what they were watching.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|I bought this CD just for the tune &quot;About Her&quot;, which is a smooth, stylish, contemporary nod to a classic track, just like this fantastic movie pays tribute to its inspirations.  This tune, played during a pivotal sequence between The Bride and Bill, takes the action down a notch, adding a fresh dimension to the vengeance machine.  The Ennio Morricone tracks are a bonus, especially for those raised on spaghetti westerns.<br />True, it does not have all the variances that the Kill Bill Vol. 1 album has, but then they are two different films are they not?  In the same way that one can regard Full Metal Jacket as one movie with two distinct halves, one should think the same of these Volumes.  As such, the music reflects the unique vision of each piece.
B000003B6J|4.0|In the current age of rap, this CD is a gem. I'm not going to go into detail about why it's so great, you already know that from previous reviews. I'm just  going to wholehearteadly recommend this CD to anyone who's tired of the rap thats being played now. Dont' get me wrong, i like Gunit, Jay-Z etc but its just getting annoying to listen to the exact same thing(money, women, cars, Jewerly). That's why i've pulled out my dusty 2pac,Biggie,Wu-tang, NWA CDs out. If ur tired of rap now, listen to this album, u wont be dissappointed.
0684800713|4.0|The Sun Also Rises is a fast read and features some very beautiful writing by Ernest Hemingway.  It is populated by some rather affectless Paris expatriates who decide to visit Pamplona.  One, Jake Barnes, is a strong man with an unfortunate wound.  Another, Brett Ashley, would like to be Jake Barnes' girlfriend but can't be.  They and their friends experience drama and calamity but fortunately have plenty of alcohol at hand to numb themselves with.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have been a fan of Star Wars since 1980, and the oringals are the best.  I was very excited for the special editions when they were released in the 90s, but let us face it, George Lucas has lost his touch.  He relies to heavily on ILM, which has very low grade technology, especially when compared to Weta Digital (the special effects creators for Lord of the Rings).  Lucasfilm has tanked just like Disney.  It is very sad to see two great film production compannies go downhill so quickly.

B00005JM02|4.0|on of the best animated featurs I've seen
B00005JMEW|5.0|I love this movie so much. I think that all of you who gave this movie only 1 or 2 stars is completely wrong. First off, you expected this to be so great and all since Pulp Fiction came out. You in your mind are just comparing it to Pulp Fiction, cause this movie was almost as good as Pulp Fiction to me. All of you are complaning about \\"dynamic charcters\\" are crap like that. Well guess what, If you were a bride at a wedding, your husband and baby got killed and you got shot in the head only to wake up four years later, you would want revenge right? You wouldn't change cause all you care about is revenge, and this to me was very realistic. And who cares if the gore was like a spray hose? I found it funny whenever someone died, and the gore with just awesome, and he wanted to make all these gorey fight scenes cause the movie gets more interesting. <BR>The anime was also great, i thought that tarantino decided to try something new and so what if you didnt like it? It was still a creative way to play out the story. I mean what 11 year old girl is gonna act and pretend to shoot 3 guys, impale someguy, and sit under a bed while some woman dies ontop. I was also completely shocked when she killed \\"copperhead\\" in the beggining telling the daughter \\"you mother had it coming to her\\" By far the best scene was at the meeting with Lucy Liu, and the japanese man calling her something bad so she goes to kill him. If you want to see this movie, dont see it expecting it to be another pulp fiction, but another completely fresh movie as if pulp fiction never existed, then see how it is then.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I don't buy music CDs very often,however, I was intrigued by this one having heard 'You lift me up' on television.  Frankly, I was expecting the usual operatic themes, much like Andrea Boccelli or Russell Watson provide on their CDs.  What I found instead was one of the best collection of songs I own.  I speak Italian and French, therefore, I have no trouble with those songs.  They are beautiful!  His Portugese song has inspired me to learn Portugese!  I was quite taken by this CD; so much so that I bought one for my parents and they listen to it all the time.  The fact that his renditions span 3 generations attests to the fact that he is a great artist who will only improve with time.  Additionally, he is extremely good looking.  Congratulations to such a fine young man.  &quot;Closer&quot; is a wonderful CD.
B00008EY9G|1.0|In &quot;Adventures In The Screen Trade&quot; Bill Goldman tells a story about the moment in &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; where the audience turned on the film, and began to hate it. Once a film loses an audience in a way that makes them hostile, it's impossible to get them back. And so it was with me, and &quot;Identity&quot;.<br />Without giving away spoilers it's a little hard for me to describe exactly what it is about this movie that I disliked so intensely, but at its heart my problem is with the central contrivance of the script, which becomes apparent about 20 minutes into the film. The film asks the viewer to speculate on what might or might not be real. The problem with this as a plot device is: if it's not real, do I care what's going on? Superior writers manage to overcome this (for example, Charlie Kaufmann does a pretty bang-up job most of the time with completely unreal scenarios, but it doesn't matter because the purpose of the unreality is to focus the viewer on something else that's important, although he likewise came unstuck in the third act of &quot;Adaptation&quot; for the same reasons). The problem in &quot;Identity&quot; is that the script revolves around trickery that ultimately serves no purpose. If nothing is as it seems, and the characters aren't particularly likeable, and none of this is going toward any larger view, what the heck is the point? &quot;Identity&quot; becomes a very irritating exercise in style. Unfortunately it's not that stylish.<br />The cast can't be faulted - all excellent. And the direction is fine. What a pity the script is so awful. I truly loathed this film.
0789723107|5.0|I loved this book, it was simple to read, funny, and informative. Not only have I used it for my University degree, I've used the principles in my work too!<br />Highly reccomended.
B00009EJC5|5.0|Yeah, I know that title is from the intro of &quot;Get On the Goot Foot&quot;<BR>which isn't on this CD, but it certainly fits this excellent collection.<br />This is simply the BEST of JB from about 1969 to 1971. All killer no filler! I DEFY anyone to sit still while songs like &quot;It's A New Day,&quot; &quot;Hot Pants&quot; (this tune introduced me to JB when I was 7 in 1971), &quot;Talking Loud and Saying Nothing&quot; (among the most danceable and profound of his sermon songs) and the bonus beat of &quot;The Funky Drummer&quot; which rappers beat to the ground in the 80s and 90s. Oh yeah, brace yourself for &quot;Give It Up and Turn it Loose&quot; (Clap your hands-stomp your feet-in the jungle brothers!). <br />It's easy to be overwhelmed by the funk power of what JB puts down on this. Listen and see why!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Love Actually was one of my favorite films of the year.While some of the stories began to crumble around the edges near the end, it was never the less endearing and sentimental. Exactly the kind of film you want to watch around the holidays. <BR>As much as I loved all the stories I dearly wish they could release a double disc with a toned down version. Even though I did enjoy the story with the couple who meets rehearsing for the actors in a porn movie, it spoils the potential to watch the film with kids and in my case, the older parents as well who would really enjoy everything else. A friend said they saw such a version on an airplane flight and it didn't take away from the pleasure of the film in the slightest. Ordinarily I would never make such a request of a movie. But this film is so delightful and would be a wonderful perennial family favorite (...). I'd watch the film as is for myself. But I would love to share it.<BR>I think they would do well to make a rare exception in this case take advantage of the DVD format to offer a PG-13 cut without that storyline.This is a special movie, special case scenario, not a puritanical rant. I have heard others voice a similar sentiment. If this is the case for you maybe give this review a helpful vote to nudge the studio into releasing a special edition package. I am going to cross my fingers and wait and hope they release such a version in November.
B00003CXBH|5.0|The Mission is the best movie I have ever seen. It has the rare quality of being a film that makes such powerful social commentary that every time I view it I am filled with rage and sadness and flee to books looking for answers for men's wretchedness or out into real life filled with pragmatic melioristic energy.<BR>Too much of modern life is lived out in inertia and comsumer naivete. We eat, drink, and party while so many suffer. This movie stands out as a rebuttle to the superficiality of American life and a condemnation of our sins of omission. What is really hard is getting the distracted, nihilistic herd to sit up and pay attention to something besides themselves and American Idol. Quit playing golf. Get to know the people who package your food, who pick your food, who make your toys, who work in the factories that make your car. Get to know someone who is hungry. Live more modestly and help more generously. Read Thoreau, Nietzsche, Postman, etc.<BR>The Mission is one of the few movies I have seen which can help people see a glimpse of something higher than the ennui and anomie and inertia of modern life.
B000059Z8M|5.0|It's not the extraordinary animation that makes this film work so well, it's the characters, the voices and the music (anyone who doesn't cry during Jesse's song has a heart of stone, it's one of the finest things Randy Newman has ever written). But mostly it's the script. Multi-layered in a way that I still can't quite get over, it's got everything from good fun and drama for kids to genuine questions of identity and meaning for adults. Plus, of course, some great jokes. Like most good kids films, this one has been played hundreds of times at our place, to the point where I could probably recite every line by heart, but it still has the power to move me. Of course its impact on 4 year olds is much much better :)
0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha is a very soothing tale. It is spiritually uplifting, captivating, serene, profound; even somewhat magical. The story is set in ancient India, where a young brahman called Siddhartha is troubled by questions in life. He leaves his hometown and first decides to lead a life of an ascetic (samana), then a hedonist. Ultimately, Siddhartha becomes spiritually cleansed, and gets transformed into the enlightened ferryman.<br /> The thing I like about this book is that it does not portray India as a land of snakecharmers and expressive bollywood actors.This book is a good overview on the subtle aspects of Indian life. It tries to illustrate the actual depth of Indian thinking.<br /> But I do have a few complaints. The author likes to insert unnecessary sexual innuendos in the novel. For example, Hesse talks about naked breasts, \\"climbing up the tree\\" (didn't get that one), and the concept of \\"give and take\\". In doing this, I think Hesse falsifies one aspect of Indian life, and definitely taints the quintessentially spiritual plot of the novel.<br />  Don't read this book if you are looking for a guide to Hinduism or Buddhism. The author explicitly rejects Hinduism for its overbearingly ritualistic insistance, he rejects Buddhism for its missionary activities (his father and mother were peitist missionaries in India). In these bold rejections, Hesse might appear somewhat conceited. I think he is trying to create a fusion of western individualism and eastern mysticism; he lacks the proper perspective. Readers should not take this book for an authorative source on the different facets of eastern life.<br />  Another big backdraw is Hesse's inclination to distort. For instance, in Indian mythology, Vasudeva is the father of Lord Krishna. In Siddhartha, he is the godlike ferryman-guide who \\"guides\\" Siddhartha. Then he disappears into the forest? This is a flagrant distortion of tradition. In another distortion, Govinda is Siddhartha's friend in the novel, whereas in reality, in Hindu mythology Lord Krishna is lovingly called Govinda by his devotees. To complement this trend of distortion, there is Gotama (Gautama), who is Buddha. To anyone who has studied World History, it is obvious that Siddhartha and Gotama were the same person before and after enlightenment respectively. One can only wonder why Hesse plays with the facts so much.<br />  Nonetheless, this book is powerful due to its sheer simplicity, serenity, and sprituality. It is a great read. I will give three stars to this book if read through an eastern perspective, and five stars if read from a Western perspective.eality, in Hindu mythology Lord Krishna is lovingly called Govinda by his devotees.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is quite possibly one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. While some might say the movie is gratuitous and overly gory, Quintin is satirically poking fun at those very people every time so much as a finger gets chopped off. The excess of blood (often more than humanly possible) is very much intended, as a subtle mockery of the excess of violence in our culture. Quintin is communicating with us in the simplest of form. It isnt the limb getting chopped off that is funny, but the sheer absurdity of the situation; Kill Bill hardly ever takes itself seriously. While the humor is quite subtle, it is very much present, and a large part of what makes this movie great. Tarintino's humor persists even in the &quot;making of Kill Bill&quot; featurette in which he goes on about how difficult descisions like picking his actors, soundtrack, and even the movie concept itself were actually just made in split seconds. He goes so far as to say he picked an actor simply because he saw her on a box of a video at his local rental store!<br />Quintin Tarintino is a genius, and this movie his brain child.
0140131558|2.0|We read City of Glass for our book club and 8 out of 9 of us could not bear to read the last two stories of the Trilogy.  Though we all agreed it was well written, it was a story that carried the reader  all over the place without actually ever arriving anywhere.   Was Paul Auster trying to be clever or was he trying to write a good story?    I believe cleverness was his intent,  and in this case it is a shame because I missed a potentially good narrative.
B00003W8NM|3.0|Fight Club is an excellent portrayal of what happens when men face up to the stupid, mean, and vulgar degredation they put up with as cogs in the machine of modern life. It is a very possible reaction to Radiohead's OK Computer, the best musical elaboration of the post-modern mundane mass of herd men - \\"let down and hanging around.\\"<BR>Anomie or nihilism should be a justifiably much larger concern for the modern individual. Just look at the stupid commercials for yogurt that talk about women getting ready to go to work - all lining up to head off to the grist. Feminism - the women want misery! Quit running around and sit down and face your own life, face up to how meaningless most of what you do is.<BR>Watch Fight Club, see what I'm talking about, and then go read the real thing: Nietzsche. That's all Fight Club is, Nietzsche for dummies. Nietzsche's ideas are so novel and challanging that most fans of Fight Club can overlook the nonsensical climax and enjoy the social commentary. <br />That is my recommendation. Read Nietzsche. If you need to watch Fight Club along the way, fine. It is a mediocre movie with a controversial and mind boggling philosophy that makes most viewers think it more than it is. <BR>Ironically Fight Club came out almost 100 years after Nietzsche died.
B000099T2L|2.0|May I start out by saying that I loved &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;?  I loved &quot;Baby Boy.&quot;  And I love &quot;Me, Myself, and I.&quot;  And I love her latest release from this album, &quot;Naughty Girl.&quot;<br />However, my &quot;love&quot; for her songs quickly turn into &quot;loveD.&quot; (emphasis on the &quot;D&quot;)  Her beats and rhythm are nice to listen to at first, but the listener quickly develops a bad case of earworm-- you just can't get her music out of your head all day!!!  And the lyrics are absolutely TERRIBLE.  Lyrics such as &quot;Capricorn Aquarius Pisces Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer oh! Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius I love all y'all&quot; make a listener cringe about her lack of songwriting ability.  And her Beyonc'e interlude is a cheesy attmept to rhyme with her name: &quot;Your love goes beyond what I can say, love, Beyonc'e.&quot;  Her duet with Luther Vandross on the &quot;Closer I Get To You&quot; is a bit of a disappointment.  It's good, but certainly not Grammy-worthy.  Devout R&amp;B fans may fall in love with this album, but it can quickly get tiring.
B000077VR3|5.0|This movie is the best movie of all time! I understand that it's a movie that you'll either love or hate, but I think everyone should love this movie! It was nominated for 8 Oscars, and it should have won them all. It CAN be a desperate cry for Ritalin at times, but that's the artistic style of the movie. Personally, I think the whole thing is brilliant, the stars can sing, and the dance numbers are inspired. The especially great numbers are &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds/Come What May.&quot; These moments are movie magic, and it's a rare person who can't enjoy it on some level. You find yourself singing along at times, even if you don't know the words. It's a cinematic masterpiece that should be remembered for decades to come.
B000069HK2|5.0|Is this heaven? This is quite possibly the best cd I've ever heard. I guess I should tell you now, if you dont like screaming, dont get this cd but if you do, feast your ears on this masterpiece. I cant get enough of this album. I've owned this cd for about a year now and the used has slowly but surely become my favorite band. So much emotion and intellect was put into this album and the result is a perfect hardcore screamo emo punk cd. My favs are Say Days Ago, Buried Myself Alive, Box Full of..., and Noise and Kisses. All the others are just as good but I gotta have favs so there. Please get this cd, put it in, and experience the sweetness. Only then may we be friends. Also check out Maybe Memories, their cd/dvd w/ unreleased stuff and live performances. If the s/t cd doesnt get you, Maybe Memories will. I promise. If you still dont like you may not talk to me ever again. PEACE!
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Big Fish is a creative film. If anything it is fairy tale for adults, a romp in a decadent imagination. In that sense it was fun. But more than anything it left a taste of grossly ascetic self-indulgence in my mouth. The social satire bite that made a strange story powerful in Edward Scissorhands is gone. Instead we have to be content with a childrens book that tells us nothing substantive other than we should let our imaginations run free and value family (or something like that). Where is the depth?
B00006CXXU|5.0|Never a huge fan of Christina Aguilera's, this album has me contemplating &quot;fanatic&quot; status.  Her singing is stellar, her songwriting attempt is clearly evident, and she takes risks on different styles of music on this album-- from jazz to blues to pop to rock to hip-hop to Latin-inspired music.  Overall, &quot;Stripped&quot; is truly a strong effort from Miss Aguilera.<br />The thing that makes &quot;Stripped&quot; most appealing is her upfront attitude about herself, living, and loving.  Her music deals with everyday issues from beauty to being (or feeling) violated to abuse to inner strength.  Despite her trashy fashion looks, the album is not representative (thank God) of her fashion.  Women would probably appreciate this album more than men because the album sends out a positive message for women to love themselves no matter what and that they can overcome any challenge that comes their way.  The album is a bit long (about 20 songs), but well worth the time listening and well worth the money spent on it.<br />This may be her best album, period.
B00018D44U|3.0|I was excited when I heard Nora's second CD was coming out. I really loved her debut release. She really blew me away. What a talent! So when I heard &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; I was a little disappointed. It was more in the line of Country/Folk than the Jazz/Blues feel her debut CD featured. She reminds me of folk singer Melanie here, very 70's. When I listen to this CD I am reminded of a beautiful sunny day, running around in bare feet, drinking lemonade, and catchin' dragonflies......I don't know why.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I was begging my dad to let me see the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy.  When he said, \\"Okay, you can buy them if we find them.\\"  I was thrilled.  It wasn't available anywhere until November 21, 2000, I said, \\"Dad, I found the trilogy.\\"  I was glad and watched Episodes, IV, V, and VI.  I loved the original.  I even loved \\"Empire\\" more.  But \\"Jedi\\" was the weak link.  Excellent performances by everyone, especially Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones.  But, I've never seen the original originals.  So, please, release both editions, Lucas.  Thank you.

0790731479|5.0|This is Tim Burton's best work, well this and Edward Scissorhands are his best work closely followed by Ed Wood and Big Fish.  This movie is witty, imaginiative and a little gory at times but not too gory.  This movie seems to get funnier the more you watch it.  Michael Keaton proves himself in this that he can be one of the funniest comedians if he tries.  He portray's Betelguise really good.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are great in this too.  The dvd is good.  The picture and sound is clear and crisp, but my only thing is that the menu in this dvd is HORRIBLE.  It doesn't even have a play button for it.  Come on Warner, you can do better then this.  Special Features are average considering this was one of the first dvd's to come out.  Warning: Keep kids under the age of 4 years old or younger away from this movie.  It's to bad and violent.  It even has the f word in it.  But that's why it isn't rated G like other kids movies you can watch with them instead.  This is the movie that really started Tim Burton's career.  I mean, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was good but this was way better ny far.  I recommend this to any Tim Burton fan, or evwn if your not a big fan of his work, you'll still love this movie.
0440237688|5.0|This book was an unexpected delight.  Most readers will find that this book is well written and, if your imagination is still working, a book for people of all ages.  There were some parts of the book that tried too hard to bridge reality and fantasy but they were still well done.  The book also hit on some of the very toughest problems within our own society.  Bravo!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Same old Britney.  &quot;In The Zone&quot; may have a different album title, different songs, even a different package, but it's nothing new.  Britney's vocal talent has improved somewhat, but her singing is still incredibly weak.  Her songs are electronic, dance, and rhythm-drive to hide the lack of singing ability Miss Spears possesses.  What she lacks in singing ability, she makes up for in dance numbers and dance beats.  I admire Spears' dance sequences and I enjoy listening to the beat of her music.  Her singing, however, needs work.  She and Jennifer Lopez have about the same singing ability, as far as I'm concerned.  Spears may have better lyrics, though.<br />The album is OK.  Nothing great, nothing terrible, it's just THERE.  Until Spears hires a vocal coach and stops relying on dance beats and dance numbers to carry her performances, she'll just be the same old *yawn* Britney.<br />She can aspire to be Madonna, but she'll never BE Madonna.
0786915749|5.0|its amazing how Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman could write a book so grate as this, being the first in the chronicles series it  makes you want to keep reading the second and third book, because of this three books I became a fan of dragonlance.
B00000K3D4|5.0|When I was 11 years old, running around the local Blockbuster, I saw a clip on one of the in-store TV's that made me stop and watch. A girl, who actually looked very similar to myself and was named Sarah, strangely enough, was inching across a crumbling stone ledge, accompanied by an odd-looking dwarf. My curiosity was piqued.<br />Later I found out that this movie was called Labyrinth. Despite not being the avid fantasty fan that I am now, I still wanted to see it.<br />I'm 15 now (Sarah's age in the movie...creepy!), and I just saw Labyrinth for the first time this winter. Now, I consider myself a huge fan. I've watched it three times during my spring break, and I'm planning on purchasing both the DVD and the soundtrack CD.<br />Reasons for watching?<BR>-If you're a guy, Jennifer Connelly is admittedly very pretty (if you can sit through the beginning...she's quite..melodramatic.)<BR>-If you're a girl, four words: DAVID BOWIE, EXTREME PANTS. Quite funny, actually. But let me just say, oddly and unexpectedly, David as Jareth is one of the sexiest things I've seen in my young life. Oh-so-evilly-bish.<BR>-If you appreciate a good technical production, the old-school effects and puppetry might appeal to you. Ditto for Henson fans.<br />How about THIS reason: the movie is amazing! At times, the dialogue might seem cutesy or redundant, but in general, this movie is great. The music's not half bad, either. As the world falls DOOOOOWN......
B00005JMEW|5.0|I did not see this movie on the big screen. I waited, mainly because I was not as impressed with &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; as I had been with &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  Now I wish that I had seen it in brilliant &quot;shaw-scope&quot; for the simple reason that the whole movie was so visually appealing that my meager  36&quot; screen could not seem to hold it.  The blood and gore actually acts as a comic relief to the no-stop, over-the-top action when criminal laws are not the only laws being broken (the law of gravity is totally disregarded).  The final battle, one-on-one, with Lucy Liu in the snow covered Japanese garden alone MADE this movie for me.  Only Quentin Tarantino could revive an obscure disco hit like Santa Esmerelda's cover of &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; and give it a purpose.  It made me wonder why I don't still have it in my music collection. It had been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time and will return when I buy the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; soundtrack.<br />Bravo, Mr. Tarantino. <BR>Can I send you the bill for removing the blood stains from the floor in front of my TV.
0385336810|5.0|The book is a humorous, uplifting, easy read.  A wonderfully lighthearted novel that will put you in a good mood.  WARNING:  Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down!!
B00018D44U|4.0|Warning  - if your tastes don't lean towards mellow, homebound country with little variation, you may as well just head out right now. You know what you're getting into. You've been warned.<br />Odd that I'd love Feels Like Home endlessly in comparison to Com Away With Me, which was pleasant enough... but bored me to tears. Maybe it's the fact that that I'm more inclined towards country leanings than soft-jazz elevator music. Who knows?<br />You have your downsides, of course - some songs can come across a little TOO mellow sometimes for most peoples's tastes (Humble Me is mind-numbingly sludgy and dull, and Be Here To Love Me doesn't fare much better, except for having possibly one beat per second as opposed to Humble Me not having one at all - and the accordion doesn't help either), but for the most part, you've got some solid, guitar-n-piano, country-licked cuts on here that make perfect relaxation music.<br />You've got the midtempo first single, Sunrise, the perky (yes, perky), clap-along Dolly Parton collaboration of Creepin' In (my personal favorite - although Norah sounds pretty uninterested and Dolly sounds frighteningly happy), and the sun-baked driving song Toes. The rest? You don't have to worry about those - they all eventually blend together into one long, blurry line of mellow-country... and while this can't say a lot for variety and a sudden change of sound, it sure as hell can keep the consistency sticklers at bay for the second album in a row.

0790749815|5.0|This movie starts with a bang and doesn't let you go until the very end.  This is another great, timeless, movie that Hitchcock so brilliantly put together.  Considered by some, Hitchcock's greatest work, Cary Grant is brilliant in the film as a man stuck with a bad case of mistaken identity (Don't you hate it when that happens).  This movie has so many twists and turns, you don't know what you're going to get yourself into next.<br />Filmed in different locations throughout the country, the story takes the audience on a ride of comedy, mystery, and suspense.  Cinematography doesn't get any better than this film.  Several scenes use wonderful camera angles and cuts to enhance the feeling of suspense.<br />The movie also has some very memorable characters, such as Cary Grant's character, Thornhill, Eva St. Marie's Eva Kendall, and my favorite, the evil Leonard played by Martin Landau (He is so creepy in this).  From opening to the ending scene, this movie will hold you all the way.  So sit back and enjoy the ride.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Yes, \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Master of Reality\\", \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" are monster 5-star albums of essential skull-crushing prototypical Sabbath heavy metal and equally deserving is this great classic, \\"Sabotage\\". Absolutely ! <br />When I first heard this gem when it came out in 1975 starting off with the blitzing, high energy \\"Hole In The Sky\\" then interluding with \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" into one of the classic quitar riffs and songs of all-time \\"Symptom Of The Universe\\", I knew I was listening to a no-brainer future classic set. \\"Megalomania\\" and \\"The Writ\\" exhibit a smooth but heavy and moody posture as Ozzy and the band show extreme versatility throughout in possibly two of the most underated tracks critically in the Sabbath catalog. \\"The Thrill Of It All\\" is extremely fantastic and one of my personal favorite Sabbath songs as Ozzy shows his unique vocal power and style with such feeling as guitarist Tony Iommi and bassist Geezer Butler combine a tight, smashing guitar assault lead by the thunderous beat of drummer Bill Ward. The incredible haunting instrumental \\"Supertzar\\" and the more \\"mainstream\\" Am I Going Insane(Radio)\\" continues to exhibit the band's growing songwriting maturity and musical prowess at the time with two more excellent tracks.<br />After \\"Sabotage\\", the \\"demons\\" of drugs and alcohol appeared to take more control of Ozzy and therefore affect the overall musical creativity and cohesion of the band. This truely was the last classic album during Ozzy-era Sabbath. Simply an essential set indeed!................
0393057658|5.0|I first was exposured to Bill James' logic in the early 80's with his commercially published baseball abstracts.  I liked his analysis, but he's only recently getting the recognition he deserves (he's currently a consultant to the Boston Red Sox).<br />I vaguely remember Billy Beane as a player (he was drafted by the Mets over 20 years ago). His playing career never panned out, but he became a disciple of Bill James, and had a approach  to baseball where winning teams don't have to spend  a lot of money -- he took rejects from other teams with an outstanding characteristic -- on base percentage.<br />It seems now Bill James ideas are in vogue among some teams (Paul dePodesta is now the GM of the LA Dodgers, he was Beane's assistant int he book).<br />I've always rooted for teams which won without the highest payroll in the league -- this book discusses how Beane has been able to do it consistently -- even though he never  won a championship yet.  <br />The book traces Beane's career (or lack of it), and he ended up in a GM job, his statistical approach to baseball (which is currently unconventional, but very logical).  A good behind the scenes look at an unconventional organization
6305327041|3.0|This film has Tim Roth as a novice Bellboy getting caught up in the absurd goings on at 4 different hotel rooms, with each sequence having a different director.  Quentin Tarantino acts in and directs the last sequence, which is really the least amusing.  Overall the acting is good, with many small roles by actors/actresses such as Madonna, Jennifer Beals, Lili Taylor, Ione Skye, Bruce Willis, Marisa Tomei, Kathy Griffin, and Antonio Banderas.  The best part is directed by Robert Rodriguez, and has Banderas as the father of two kids who are involved in comic adventures (this also foreshadows Rodriguez's development of the Spy Kids films).  There are no extras on the DVD and the first sequence with the wiccans is a bit creepy in retrospect since they are involved in Diana goddess worship in a film made before Princess Di was killed.  Of course, the last sequence is pretty dark for a comedy, so this film is really a mixed bag.
0767836286|5.0|First, raspberries to the reviewers who felt impelled to give away the ending.  It would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it, guys!!!<br />Anyway, ARLINGTON ROAD is one dark and disturbing movie, fueled with paranoia, suspicions, and mistrust.  Jeff Bridges, looking for the first time like an elderly gentleman (not old, just aging), gives a tense performance as a history teacher who lost his FBI wife in a botched raid.  He now teaches terrorism at a college in the DC area.  The movie's opening is gutwrenching from the start, but necessary to involve Bridges with his new neighbors, played like Stepford Wives by Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins.  But all is not as it seems.  Bridges is sure Robbins is a terrorist, responsible for a dreadful bombing in St. Louis, and is ultimately planning more bombings.  Bridges' live-in girl friend (Hope Davis) at first doesn't buy into Bridges' theory, but later finds proof that brings her to Bridges' side.  From there on, though, it's a frightening change of pace as Bridges races to stop Robbins' plot and save his son in the meantime.  Mark Pellington's direction is right on, and the ending is quite unexpected.<br />This is not a conventional movie, and not one that brightens your day, but it is an intense, well-done and unusual thriller.<br />Well made!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I was so excited and happy to see this kind of good action and revenge movie. The movie's pilot is pretty simple, bad guys deserve to be revenged and die. But the director tell the story in a refreshing and beautiful way. The action scence feel so real how they make it even though I don't expect to see it in real life. It is a very good direction for action and kongfu movie. No other lame movies just make a kongfu a joke, or try to figure out how people can fight with machine.<br />Only one thing totall looks not real, how she can bring such a big knife on plane?

B0000VCZKM|1.0|There are a few reviews out there that say full frame is just fine and we should stop crying and just say how good the movie is. Well I can't when the movie is no longer good. Full screen doesn't just take away almost half the movie, it brings an added grain to the movie that makes them unwatchable. If you believe this is not true then just watch the special feature that is included on &quot;Die Hard&quot; the five star edition. I tried watching &quot;Annie&quot;, but I couldn't because it was no longer the crisp and clear version I remember seeing at the movie theater.

B00003CXCT|1.0|Original or \\"improved\\"--which is better? I for one have always preferred the original theatrical cuts of the three movies. The new effects fit very poorly with the original shots--a problem that is endemic throughout the 'new' trilogy--and essentially add nothing. However, some people like the new version, and I respect that. Therefore, Lucas should have cranked out *two* DVD sets. One with the original cut, one with the expanded cuts. Easy as pie--people do it with fullscreen/widescreen movies all the time. Might even have made *more* money. But, no. Now, if I want to see the originals, I have to fall back on my VHS tapes. Not a bad alternative, but lacking. Lucas has been on a downward slide for awhile; his refusal to allow us to choose is the final insult.
B00008ADPF|3.0|now, im a big fan of nickelback. i have all four of their label released albums, including this one. i will say right now that this is the worst one they have done. when i first bought it, i was quite impressed with many of the songs, but as time wore on i found that it wasnt holding my interest as long as i'd like. <BR>now whats wrong i hear you all cry. well lets list:<BR>1.someday is NOT the best song on this godforsaken album. i dont care what everyone says. the best one is track 2. (great solo!)<BR>2.a few of the songs sound almost exactly the same. ie: 'throw yourself away'-'because of you'<BR>3.they've picked the worst song as a single. 'feelin to damn good'<BR>4.i've heard ALL of the so called secret tracks already. 'saturday night's' on my sisters charlie's angels soundtrack, 'learn the hard way' is on the how u remind me single', and i heard 'yankin out my...' on english radio before the album came out.<BR>5.the album runs out of breath by about track ten. 1 to many fillers. ie; the abysmal 'figured you out'<BR>there are good points here. 'do this anymore' is by far the best song here, and i also enjoy 'should've listened','because of you','flat on the floor','throw yourself away',and 'see you at the show'.<br />overall, quite dissapointed. although not awful, not as good as i would have expected. i hope for the next album that they revert slighty back to their early days,(curb,the state.both excellent), by really banging out a good few tunes and deliver some cutting lyrics. i think a few other disilussioned fans may well disagree with me. if not, just press the unhelpful button if youre happy with another album of few gems, many mediocre, and almost no punch.<br />Thank you for your time. Disilusioned fan. Peace.
B000002UVX|5.0|The '60s were the Golden Age Of Rock, and thus, I'd argue, the Golden Age of live albums. You had The Who's Live At Leeds, The MC5's Kick Out The Jams, Velvet Underground's Live 1969, The Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, and a slew of fine Bob Dylan bootlegs (the two best being released under the \\"Bootleg Series\\" as Live 1964 and Live 1966--go buy them if you haven't).<br />However, ranking at the top of this pile of finely polished diamonds is Jimi Hendrix's performance at the Filmore East on New Year's Eve, 1969. As far as I'm concerned, this release is in a class of its own. What makes it even better is that Band Of Gypsys was released primarily due to CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (!). Yet not one second of this album sounds like Jimi \\"going through the motions.\\" If anything, this was the pinnacle of his recorded output (rivalled ONLY by Electric Ladyland, and that album is almost double the length).<br />Band Of Gypsys represents an evolution from Hendrix's earlier works with The Experience. Jimi was trying to dispell the overblown image that the public and press had saddled upon him after his showboating performances at earlier live venues such as the Monterey Pop Festival. He was trying to move in a more funk-based, introspective, and earthy direction. After The Experience disbanded (bassist Noel Redding quit) in June 1969, Jimi tried experimenting with various lineups in future performances, including a big band dubbed Gypsy, Sun, & Rainbows that headlined at Woodstock that August.<br />However, that band didn't pan out for very long. Jimi was soon looking for a new band, finally settling on bassist and old Army buddy Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles. The resulting Band Of Gypsys headlined at the Filmore, fulfilling the contract and then some.<br />This is on the short side for a live album, being 45 minutes long and containing only six songs. However, the key here is QUALITY. Jimi himself, along with Eddie Kramer, had a hand in producing, editing, and remixing the album. This is important; Jimi clearly had a better ear than anyone when it came to his own performances, as later hack jobs by Alan Douglas and the slightly less grievous edits by Eddie Kramer on Jimi's postumous releases did no justice to his sound at all (there is now a two-disc \\"complete\\" version of the Filmore Concerts in print produced by Kramer; if you are a completist it's worth picking up despite some questionable edits).<br />That's all well and good, but I suppose I should probably talk about the music now. Band Of Gypsys is worth every superlative heaped on it. After all, it kicks off with the uber-funky Who Knows (the shortest 9 minutes of your life) and MACHINE GUN. 'Nuff said. By the way, this is arguably the best recorded take of Machine Gun--Jimi never played it the same way twice. With Buddy Miles' rifle-shot drumming and Jimi's amazing Stratocaster gymnastics, it simulates the sound of no-man's land better than any metal recording I've heard to date. At the 4:00 mark, Jimi hits that one note, raising it to air-siren intensity, in a way that takes your breath. For me, there are only a small handful of compositions that reveal the full potential of the six-string guitar. Machine Gun stands at the top of that elite class. At the end, the crowd is practically rapt with amazement; there is a moment of disbelieving silence, then the audience rises in standing ovation, filling the venue with its roaring approval. Probably the greatest thing they ever witnessed; I seriously wish I was there.<br />The album would be worth purchasing for those two songs alone, but wait, it gets BETTER. Next up is Changes, a great funk groove in which Buddy takes the lead with his soulful vocals, and engages with Jimi in some great call-and-response toward the end, getting the crowd involved too. Jimi's solo that comes in at 2:00 absolutely SMOKES. Power Of Soul and Message To Love are also grand statements of Jimi's new musical vision, and We Gotta Live Together concludes the album on another Miles-led R&B raveup.<br />There is a lot of debate among the hardcore Jimi fans over whether who was better at backing Jimi--Miles and Cox, or Mitchell and Redding? I think that point is irrelevant. Both lineups had their strengths and worked appropriately with the styles Jimi adopted. However, I will say that Cox was generally a vast improvement over Redding on bass. Before his death in 1970, Jimi played a few shows with Mitchell and Cox. It's too bad that Jimi passed on before the potential of that lineup could be realized.<br />Alright, I've rambled long enough. Suffice to say, no music fan's libary is complete without this release. Sell your mother if you have to. It's worth it.ther concludes the album on another Miles-led R&B raveup. <br />There is a lot of debate among the hardcore Jimi fans over whether who was better at backing Jimi--Miles and Cox, or Mitchell and Redding?

B0000DIXDR|5.0|Ok. I just watched Dirty Dancing for the first time in a decade, at the very least, after buying it on DVD. As an older and far more seasoned, horizons-broadened moviewatcher, I just have to say: I was SO not disappointed. It was all I remembered--and let me tell you, I remembered it in almost embarrassingly excruciating detail--and even a bit more.<br />As some reviewers have astutely (and maybe a little jadedly?) pointed out, there are quite a few elements of this story that are predictable--and yes, even cliched--now. But I think that an important point is that, if you see this movie at the age that you really SHOULD--between 12 and 15, let's say, whether that was in 1987 or right now--they are far less predictable and most likely not at all cliched. Rebellion, passion, love, and sex should be relatively new to the first-time viewer. And if they are, this movie hits like a bomb. Hell, it's a revelation.<br />Now, that being said, I got things out of this most recent viewing--at a salty old age 27--that I never did at 12 to 15. For one thing, the importance of the era in which the film takes place had little or no relevance for me at the time. Class conflict, as such, was pretty foreign, and while I recognized it in a naive way back then, it has more relevance now. The number of levels on which this movie is a coming-of-age story--feminism, the freedom riders, the sexual revolution, the Camelot years when they had yet to come to an end, the idealism that usually can't help but get squashed down a bit by what adults superciliously referred to as the \\"real world\\"--these concepts were fuzzy or nonexistent for me the first time I was introduced to the former hotness known as Patrick Swayze.<br />And speaking of which--I think this movie has one of THE best sex scenes in history--for girls and women, that is. For the average guy, there may be a bit too little...substance. But this movie is, in my opinion, sexy in a way that is innocent and knowing at the same time. It was tantalizing then and almost tender now. An added perk.<br />So, in short--go buy this, Baby. You won't regret it.It was tantalizing then and almost tender now.

B00007JVBI|5.0|This album is truly amazing. I can listen to it over and over again without ever getting bored. Up until last week, I had never even heard of Cat Power. When I came across the song He War online, I knew I just had to have this album. I think every song on the album is wonderful. If I had to choose two favorites they would be He War and I Don't Blame. In my opinion, this album is a must have for music lovers everywhere.

From their 1974 selt titled album &quot;Rush&quot; to the latest studio release in the new millenium &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;, &quot;Permanent waves&quot; offers the best example of this bands musical and lyrical talent. Released on January 1 1980 &quot;Permanent waves&quot; (Produced by Terry Brown)carried Rush from the depths of &quot;Concept&quot; or &quot;Progresive&quot; rock to a unique style that sets them apart from any other band.<br />All Rush albums showcase the abilities of this Canadian trio but &quot;Permanent waves&quot; stands out as a masterpiece. The 1981 release &quot;Moving pictures&quot; has a few more radio friendly tracks but lacks the ability to pull you as a listener and wrap you around entire album as one work instead of a collection of songs.<br />Start here... If you dont like it, you won't like Rush. If it opens your mind and ears to the world of Rush you have so much more to look forward too. <br />Neil Peart (Pronounced like a &quot;pier&quot; Piert not like the shampoo &quot;Pert&quot;) is not only the greatest rock drummer in the world but one of the best lyricist ever. Read along as you listen and enjoy the ride that is RUSH.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|This project had a lot of potential, but in the end, it didn't make it onto the final product.  What you're left with is a bit over produced and flat renditions.

B00006878K|5.0|I purchased this album on Friday the thirteenth after hearing a few of Albert King's tracks, knowing that I would not be dissapointed. <BR>This album starts off with the great songs: &quot;Born Under A Bad Sign,&quot; an anthem to those with bad luck and then continues to give one blues classic after another. <BR>Anybody reading this review probably already knows about Albert King's adept guitar playing and there is really no need to say that much more about it, but I will. In my opinion he is the best of the three kings (Albert, Freddy, and BB). His guitar is very mixed, sometimes he delivers the little riff in between each line and other times he goes all out and plays really fast and powerful solos, other times he is just committed to creating a melody. He did everything that a great guitar player needed to do on this album and surely it will not dissapoint any fan of the blues.

I would liek to see Simple Plan do that<br />3.)Do real punk badns get booed off main stage at Warped Tour.<br />        No, most punk bands that do play warped tour do not play main stage the play a piece of crap small satge that no one relaly goes to becuase they are MTV crazy, at Warped Tour 2003 Simple Sh*t went on after the Suicde Machines and before the Used. SO after the suicide machines ripped things up goos old hardcore punk band SImple Sh*t went on to get bowed and stuff thrown at them. There may have been 100 kids actually wanting to see them the rest 5000-7000 ppl did not wnat anything to do with them so they yelled stff at them and threw stuff at them. <br />Wow what a Punk band they go on MTV and TRL,they write about girls, and they get boed off main stage at Warped Tour- what a punk band i didn't know all of that was real punk wiat its not.<br />To all you people out there that buy these NOW collections and watch MTV adn TRl find a life and stop posing becuase real punk groups join bands becuase they feel thretend by society and are out of place and need a outlet. But now a days people join \\"punk\\" groups becuase of fashion and truly don't know what punk is and for now punk is dead these pop badns ahve ruined it for everyone in this genration this music is Punk music and most people dont know what real punk is and bands like this have ruined t forever.
B00008RH1H|2.0|I love Kurosawa, but this stripped down version of Macbeth is no Ran, his tribute to King Lear, which even my 11 year old loved.  The dialogue is tedious, the wife is boring and not the catalyst she should be psychologically, and all but disappears once she takes matters into her own hands-- until the out damned spot scene.  Too many scenes of riders approaching the castle in real time, etc.  Some great scenes, but lo-oo-nnngg dry stretches in between.  And where is the stand in for McDuff?  That's the dramatic tension along with the wife.  Both are inexplicably blown, here.
B000001IPP|5.0|this is by far the one CD that shows why i love rancid. there is not one song on this CD you will skip over, guarenteed. I wish myself that i would have started here as far as rancid goes. long story short buy it, 12 dollars is by far the best bang for your buck, BUY IT!
0060931671|4.0|The Crying of Lot 49 was Pynchon's response to people who considered his first novel, V, to be too difficult, too complex and just plain old too weird to stomach.  It is considerably shorter, clocking it at only 152 pages, but each one is jam packed full of patented Pynchon weirdness, with zany characters, ridiculously implausible scenarios and plots within plots within plots.<br />Speaking of plot, there are two ways to describe it.  One is to say that it is about Oedipa Maas wandering California trying to figure out a conspiracy that seems to involve everyone she knows.  The other is to read the book.  There really isn't any middle ground. The problem with that is that the former doesn't mention Vatican cover-ups, child movie stars, highly lethal cans of hair spray, horn symbols, a band by the name of the Paranoids who aren't, LSD-addicted radio announcers or archaic postal systems trying to destroy American society, while the latter would take up just over 150 pages, far beyond the scope of this review.<br />The writing is typical Pynchon.  Some sections meander into ruminations on a character's psyche, or page-long sojourns into plays, conspiracies, wanderings, etc.  Other paragraphs are so fast paced that if your mind wanders for a second,  you'll miss something important and have no idea what is going on.  Often these crucial sentences are buried within a morass of extraneous information, so readers should pay attention at all times.  <br />The names are fun and ridiculous.  Mike Fallopian, the duchy of Squamuglia, Yoyodyne, Wharfinger, Chiclitz, Dr Hilarious, the list goes on.  Settings are predictable only in the way that they will be completely unpredictable, in essence, you never know when or where the story is going to take you next.<br />Does it end satisfactorily?  Can Pynchon recover all the myriad threads into a cohesive whole?  No.  But then, if he did, the story wouldn't make sense.  By being about paranoia and conspiracy, an actual concrete resolution would hurt the book more than it would help.  The closing sentence is a perfect example of this, and will probably seem frustrating to a casual reader, but if you sit back and think about it, no other ending would suffice.  A masterful work, one that is extremely accessible for those people who are (rightly) intimidated by the monster that is Gravity's Rainbow.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This CD is better than I thought it would be. Reading the song titles which include &quot;Cold Hard B****&quot; I was skeptical. But then I listened to it...its awesome. The songs are original and aren't &quot;screaming&quot; rock, they have quality and are exceptionally good. I recommend this CD to those who like rock and bands like ACDC and Led Zepplin. The CD is amazing!
630516889X|5.0|This movie is about an alien, called the Predator, who goes and hunts humans for sport. But now a military group is trying to stop the Predator once and for all. This is a really cool movie. Oh, yeah, the alien can blend in with the jungle his in. This movie contains two actors that are now goveners. I wish the actors from this film was in the second one. My favirite part was the cool fight in the end. African girl was cute. This was a great film. Can't wait for Alien vs. Predator
0385512104|5.0|What a remarkable and brilliant book this is. I had read all of the reviews and read it to see what the fuss was about. It is certainly my favourite read of 2004.<br />It is an apparently simple whodunnit but told from the persepctive of the 15 year old Asperger's sufferer Christopher Boone. Domestic problems, simple journeys and idle chatter become intriguing adventures through the eys of the narrator who sees things very differently.<br />Mark Haddon shows a very clear insight into the autistic mind. We get a real insight into what we dismiss as 'behavioural problems'. On one page you cry and on the next you laugh out loud. <br />This book deserves to be read. Now!
B0001KL5DA|5.0|The more I watch the episodes of this incredibly dark, witty, and articulate show, the more layers I unfold of the characters and how they relate to each other. The beautiful truth - the fragility of life and the finality of death - is interlaced in every episode and in every character. The more I try to analyze the writing of the show, the more it blows my mind. Amazing...
B0001FR3IG|4.0|Psychiatrist Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) wakes up inside a cell at the very institution she has been working in this movie. One dark and stormy night, Miranda takes a detour and almost runs over a young girl (Kathleen Mackey) and the next thing she wakes up in the mental institution. It turns out she has killed her husband (played by Charles Dutton) and left a cryptic message in blood on the wall. The movie takes you through lots of twists and turns, from start to finish. I thought the cinematography was great and really set the pace for the movie, as well as the suspense factor. It was a great movie, however the end was very clich&eacute; and typical horror movie resolution. However, it's still a great movie and Halle Berry proves why she is a fine actress yet again, and why she deserved to win that Oscar a few years ago.
B00009ATIX|4.0|I admire the boldness of Soderbergh and Cameron to make a film like this in today's landscape of empty and overblown blockbusters. Honestly, I'm not sure that they made this film to be a &quot;blockbuster;&quot; I believe it was made for genre fans and for themselves. <br />As for the film itself, I thought that it was wonderful. Amongst many other things, I found the treatment to be very focused and consistent, every shot and editing choice to be extremely well thought out, the acting great, and the music very appropriate and &quot;choice.&quot; I liked that the script was implicit: it helped the film to avoid pretention. The love story was also in the tradition of films like &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back:&quot; understated. Going into it, I thought that it would be overwrought, but it was intimate, absract, and on a &quot;need-to-know&quot; basis. I also thought that the film did a great and careful job of exploring some loose-ended philosophical topics such as free will and determinism without getting carried away with it (a hallmark of great, classical sci-fi). In fact, I found everything to be done only as much as it needed to be done and also found it easy to follow.<br />I've seen the film twice and plan on seeing it many more times. It's not exactly the type of film that I'd have my friends over for, but neither is a film like &quot;Blade Runner.&quot; Speaking of that film, it was originally received in much the same way that this film has been. It took the preceding years after its theatrical release to find its &quot;cult&quot; audience. I hope to see the same for Soderbergh's &quot;Solaris&quot; and I don't find it too much of a stretch to say that Soderbergh and Cameron had the same thing in mind when they made the film.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Tarantino made a smart move when he decided to film a two-part martial arts movie. In the wake of the Matrix films and Lord of the Rings, he could cut his four-hour flick in half and release it 6 months apart. Ten years ago, he might not have been able to. By cutting it in half, he took a long, rambling movie and turned it into two tight movies. This DVD, the first part, moves fast. It's funny, violent, and full of memorable scenes and images.    Another reason it's such a smart move: Tarantino is a movie geek, so he can throw in dozens of \\"homages\\" to his favorite kung fu movies in this movie. If you get the references (like Uma wearing Bruce Lee's yellow motorcycle outfit) that's great. If not, you don't miss out on anything essential.    Tarantino is still mixing up the sequence of events, telling the story out of order, and it still works. The audience can follow along the first time, but the movie is better the second or third time, when you have a better idea of who's who and what's going on. In Pulp Fiction, the out-of-order sequence puts you off-balance. This time, he's so good at it, you can't imagine telling the story any other way.    Tarantino challenged himself in Kill Bill to shoot great action sequences, and he succeeded. The fights are the high points. They are suspenseful, intercut with humor and dialogue, and too stylized to be taken seriously. The swordfight at the end is fantastic, even if you only pay attention to the lighting. (Which brings me to Robert Richardson, the cinematographer for Kill Bill. Best known for his work on Natural Born Killers and other Oliver Stone movies, he's the guy who puts the glowing light behind everyone. Overhead lights shimmer in the hair of actors, and windows bleed light around the edges. It's a nice effect.)    You can't go wrong with this film. Although the DVD doesn't have a lot of extras, the movie itself is worth it. Tarantino has developed his directing and writing style, making it simpler without losing any of his trademarks: the Seinfeld-like conversations, the long takes, the camera-in-the-trunk point of view, sudden bursts of violence, and fake product placement. This is his fourth film and he hasn't peaked yet. He's four for four..
B0001AP12G|4.0|This is an extremely hot album, one of the best of the year so far next to Death Is Certain. It starts off with 'We Don't Care' which is a pretty good intro, took awhile to get into...Then we come to one of the best songs on the album, 'Spaceship'. Trying a little bit a 3/4 time...and it's very well done. The next song, 'Jesus Walks' is a very dope song as well. 'Never Let Me Down' would be one of my favorites but J-Ivy's terrible flow ruined it for me. Jay-Z and Kanye drop heat though. 'Get Em High' is great lyrically, it doesn't get much better collab wise on this album. The beat is OK, a bit more club-ish then his other beats...The next few tracks I skip every time, I'm not feelin 'The Workout Plan' beat much at all...the weird string things sound off-key and screw it up.<br />Next we come to an extended version of the hit song 'Slow Jamz'. It's just more singing from Jamie Foxx that really isn't necessary. 'Breathe In Breathe Out' is a good song but would be much better if Luda had spit a verse. The hook was something Kanye had written anyways so he hardly did anything. The following 'School Spirit' skits and the Jimmy skit are funny, but the 'School Spirit' song sucks, and for some reason is edited even on the dirty version of the album.<br />The next song 'Two Words' is my favorite song off the album. Mos Def has a dope verse, putting aside the mispronounciation of Kanye's name. Freeway even comes good on this song. The beat is amazing as well. Next is 'Through The Wire' which is an OK song, but I don't like the beat. 'Family Business' is pretty good...the beat isn't the best but it's still listenable. The final track 'Last Call' is two verses, including the recycled line 'Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips'...the last few minutes are him talking about how he started out and how he got onto Roc-A-Fella...<br />Overall this album is very dope, 4 stars because of the filler. ('School Spirit') Highly recommended.
1592400876|5.0|Eats Shoots & Leaves is a  very helpful reference book especially if you have to write a lot of papers for school.<br />This book has shown me a former student how much I did not know about punctuation and that is why I enjoyed it.<br />  I thought that an apostrophe only indicated possession.  I also learned that an apostrophe can be used to indicate time or quantity or the omission of letters. Lynne Truss explains the functions and usage of common punctuation marks like the apostrophe, comma, semicolon, and colon very clearly.  I really did not know how a semicolon or colon could be used.  A semicolon shows the reader the relationship  between 2 different statements.  Colons separate subtitles from main titles in books or movies.  She provides the reader with sentences with the punctuation marks in the right place.  I really appreciated seeing how they worked in sentences.<br />There are 17 rules about how a comma is used.  Commas are not only used in lists and to join sentences.  They are also used to separate clauses to make reading easier and are used before direct speech.  The information in this book may sound basic to some people, but I found it pretty interesting.  This book will make me a better writer and a better observer when I see a misuse of punctuation.  Lynne Truss points out how punctuation can be misused everywhere on movie posters and even everyday email.  Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a wonderful written book.
0312263120|1.0|Unbelievable, check. Inaccurate, sure. But the part that makes this novel really terrible is that it's an absolute model of &quot;bad fiction.&quot; Contrived, predictable, cliche, and at many times, downright cheesy, the only good thing about DF is that it's a fast read and the therefore the pain is relatively quick.<br />Here are some questions, and these don't even include the techno-geek inaccuracies, which, not being a software engineer, I didn't catch right away:<br />If the kid lives in Spain, and is a regular at the club, how does he fail to realize that 100 pesetas is about 87 cents?<br />Why, when the lights went out in Crypto, could Susan see perfectly sometimes, but other times stumble around like it really was perfectly dark?<br />Is Susan a mathematician, computer scientist or both?  Are math-minded codebreakers computer savvy enough to write their own complex programs like the tracer?<br />Would a punk teenage use a word like &quot;weekending&quot;?<br />Did the scene where David asks Susan to marry him from the van in Seville make anyone else throw their book across the room?<br />The best thing about this novel is that it gives hope to every other aspiring novelist in the world. If this can get published, what can't???<br />Just skip this one. The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons are way better.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I already own the original edition of the trilogy on DVD (and no it isn't just some crappy rip...it's perfect quality with digital surround...and I'm not telling where I got it :) ).  Anyways, I'm still going to order the Special Edition since Amazon's price is so good.  Not as good as get the original edition for only (...), though ;)
0800141326|2.0|Godzilla was born in the heart of a nuclear blast, a terror of mankinds own creation come back to unleash the fury of a nature plagued by the disease called humanity. Only one thing could destroy the monster, another terror of mankind's hands, the Oxygen Destroyer. As a terror greater than Godzilla himself comsumed the monster, it let out one more terrible screech and the flesh was melted from his bones.<br />Godzilla spawned 27, soon to be 28 sequels, and plenty of spin-offs. All of those sequels were great in there own respects. Older folks probably grew up watching &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Destroy all Monsters,&quot; and many of the &quot;Showa&quot; series starting in 1954 and ending in 1975.<br />However, in 1998, a remake of the original film was made in America. Godzilla 1998, commonly known among fans as GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) was absolutely horrible for a Godzilla film. The monster who is the main event doesn't look, act, or remind me in the slightest way of the Godzilla we all know and love. GINO has great SFX, sure, but the FX are nothing but a cheap way for getting us to &quot;Oooh and &quot;Aaah&quot; our way into buying that the movie is actually good. This film doesn't deserve the title of Godzilla, and should not even be considered a Godzilla film. The ONLY reason I gave this movie two stars was because of the fact that it was a generally good monster movie, even though it was terrible compared to most Godzilla films (with some exceptions such as &quot;Godzilla's Revenge&quot; and &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot;)
0767817710|5.0|The Quick and the Deadly was one of the highest grossing films of the mid 90's. Though not popular with critics, it managed to pull in a crowd with it's seedy and cut-throat plot. The western revolves around a tournament style duel determining the heirship of a small town in Texas. Stars include Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio and the man who shot to fame after this film, Russel Crowe.
B00005JMEW|4.0|I actually saw this movie while I was underway since the Navy gets advance copies to watch before it hits stores and have to say that the type of action in this particular flick comes in short supply these days and apparently on the first release of the DVD, so do the extras.  For those wondering, this knocks it down a star.  I was really expecting a two-disk, boatload-of-extras extravaganza and all I got was a making-of featurette (a relatively short one at that) and a couple of music videos from the band featured in the film.  I take comfort in knowing that this is just a regular box office marketing ploy and there'll be special editions lining the shelves during Christmas time.  Enough said about that though!  In the meantime, you have a rock solid movie that entrances and entertains and well as makes you laugh and cringe (LOL....the end fight scene makes me do both).  Wonderful, colorful characters with a meandering (meaning this in a GOOD way) plotline.  Tarantino has struck gold again and will be very much looking forward to seeing Vol. 2 on the silver screen when I get the chance.  Pick it up to satisfy your craving.
0553801546|5.0|Hobb's book is a work of art. She reaches an eqiulibrium between fantasy and reality. Each character has unique qualities which convey strong emotions that you can relate to. This imaginative novel redifines fantasy, paving a way for a new genre of fantasy. This is a must read for any fantasy lover.
0385510438|5.0|Fans of John Grisham will surely like his newest novel, The Last Juror.  It takes place in Ford County, Mississippi, the fictional county John Grisham has so wonderfully created.<br />What was so delightful about this book, was how it portrayed small town America.  Mr. Grisham has so vividly detailed Ford County, that after reading this book I felt like I had been there.<br />This book will, of course, please those seeking a legal thriller.  It was a quick read, that I had trouble putting down.
0671027387|5.0|Do not begin your reading of this novel the night before you have an important morning meeting: you'll never get there. Dan Brown has crafted a classic page-turner. The Prologue has geologist Charles Brophy trudging across a glacier. Within moments, a plot involving the White House, NASA, the NRO, a power hungry Senator, various scientists, Delta Force commandos and a couple of very interesting young women begins to unfold like a series of hammer blows.<br />  Brown has the knack of painlessly leading the reader to suspend credulity. His writing is that smooth, his facts (yes, the novel is based on scientific fact) flowing together seamlessly.<br />  Heroes and villains are believable, even in the most extreme scenarios. The plot twists and weaves and the bad guys aren't who you first think they might be.<br />  One of the more unique elements of the novel is that two of Brown's main actors are young women. Though both are strikingly attractive, refreshingly Brown treats them as people, not sex objects. It's a nice touch.<br />  I am deliberately avoiding a description of the novel's actions and plot lines: it's just too much fun to discover them as they occur.<br />  The action is non-stop. Page-turner, pulse-pounder, all the cliches apply. Brown, who subsequently authored \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" is a master of the craft. Deception Point is wonderfully worthwhile.<br />Jerry
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|It's hard to explain why some people bash this band. The hype they received can't be blamed on the band, except for the fact that their music delivers. &quot;Is This It?&quot; is one of the best 25 rock albums ever. It's been three years now, and it stands up to anything by the Clash, the Velvets, the Stones, and any rock albums of the past 20 years. So you sheep who follow the anti-hype sheppard, foffndie. And retard below me, if you think they only have one idea maybe you should should try to eat some of that sht that's oozing out of your head and is stuck in your ears. &quot;Room On Fire&quot; is absolutely, amazingly beautiful. Stand-outs for me are: &quot;What Ever Happened?&quot;, &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot;, &quot;Under Control&quot;, &quot;The End Has No End&quot; and &quot;12:51&quot;.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I used to love watching startrek TNG when i was a kid but after the tv series ended i kinda stopped watching it alltogether.. i did went to see Star Trek Generations &amp; First Contact. I however after seeing 'first contact' realized that star trek isnt all what i thought it was.. not only that after getting into the X-files around the same time (actually i think i got into the Xfiles in 96-97'). To be honest with this is after going back to watching startrek again (after this dvd came out) realized that i mostly liked watching it for the action, not the drama..  Which basically thats what i base startrek on, not every episode or movie but its there.  Even though star trek: Nemesis does copy some elements from Star Trek II (which i saw way b4 nemesis) i still liked nemesis.  It doesnt make me like star trek anymore though then i already do, because really i think of it as another sci fi series. Alot of people were dissapointed &amp; outraged about the death of a certain crew member &amp; which is a copy off of ST II. However though this movie does have some really good qualities. The scene where data, la forge, worf &amp; capt. Picard are looking for pieces of an android like data. Somehow during this scene i felt like i was having deja vu.. i dont know if it has anything to do with the series with Lor.. which by the way, what the heck happened to him?? I think when i saw previews of this movie i could have sworn Lor was going to be in this movie... i just had a feeling. Anyways one thing about Star Trek that i dint really like was the lack of action in it.. If u ask me even this movie dint have the action i wanted.. but im the type of person who would like to see action for like majority of the movie. Like any other movie this one is left open for another movie so dont just say that this is the last movie.. if they are going to do another movie its not going to be just a day to make so.. but if u havnt seen this movie yet.. at least rent it
B0000VAFO0|3.0|The whole concept of Licantropes vs. Vampires is very interesting. So is part of its mythology: the way old vampires are recycled, etc. The big problem with this atmospheric movie is in the guns and how the action scenes are shot.<BR>Why supernatural beings need guns?<BR>The thing is when they start shooting each other they are no different from your average Schwarzenegger movie: bad aiming, lots of shots, bigger guns, lots of mayhem. Everything made more confusing by the look-alike types of the characters (except the wonderful Beckingsale).<BR>At the end there are big holes in the plot (SPOILERS *** why wasn't Amelia strong enough to fight the werewolves to mention one).<BR>It felt good in the theater but later, looking back, it felt like the average summer actioner. With the only plus of a couple of good ideas.
B000001IQH|5.0|This album is awesome, very few beat it. As far as punk albums, The Clash's London Calling, Green Day's Nimrod, Operation Ivy's Energy are probably the only ones that beat it. Rancid continues to keep alive the East Bay punk scene of the 80s unlike other bands of the same place and time like Isocracy, Crimpshine and others who have long broken up. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW, AND GET READY TURN IT UP FULL BLAST, CUZ THIS ALBUM IS amazing
B00008NRI9|4.0|Although it is not a brilliant film, i must say i did enjoy it. I have seen better romantic films than this, and on average i would say at least 7 or 8 out of 10 for this film. It does get more romantic towards the end and that is the best part of it because i love romantic films. Although most films arn't brilliant with sandra bullock in, i thought this was a good film you could sit back and watch.
0375713751|4.0|I end up reading a couple of works of fiction per year.  For the 2004 calendar year to date, it's this book by Allison Pearson, which I found to be charming and clever.  Unlike some reviewers, I found all the events contained in here believable.<br />Pearson really has her finger on the differing attitudes of co-workers regarding a woman and man's involved parenting.  Protagonist and narrator Kate Reddy puts up with a constant barrage of inquisition, rolled eyes and backoffice plotting each time parenting needs infringe on her growing work responsibilities.  Meanwhile, she notes with contempt that a Scottish co-worker is \\"almost knighted on the spot\\" when he takes early departure from a meeting to attend one of his kid's school recitals (\\"Oooh, you're such a hands-in parent\\" coos one admirer).<br />The web is rife with reports that Pearson's book been optioned for a movie with Nicole Kidman as Reddy, directed by Anthony Minghella (who oversaw her in 'Cold Mountain').  That might work, although 'English Patient' auteur Minghella seems a serious touch for this book.  And I guess I had an image of Emma Thompson in my head, thanks to her similar role with two small kids in Richard Curtis' recent \\"Love Actually.\\"  [Thompson has the comedic chops to pull this off as well.]

B00005JMEW|1.0|Uma is gorgeous, and the action is good, but 35% of this movie is in Japanese with NO subtitles, and 20% of this movie is Anime.<br />Very disappointed, BAD direction, this could have been condensed into 45 minutes of GOOD film, and both parts put on the same DVD.  I will NOT be purchasing the sequel.<br />With over 300 DVD's in my collection, this one was bad enough for me to write my first review.
B00003003R|4.0|The only thing this one is missing, I think, is Garden of Eden.
B000003S5H|4.0|I first heard &quot;La Femme D'Argent&quot; while in a hostel bar in Vienna.  Then again in Amsterdam in a coffee shop.  I have to say this is the quintessential chill out music for anyone who enjoys electronica.  It's just one of those tracks that you can put on repeat and listen to forever.  The rest of the album is great, but the first track is well worth the price of admission
B000089CJI|5.0|Before I heard Give Up, The Postal Service's first and only album to date, I had no idea that band members Jimmy Tamborella (aka Dntel) and Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard had previously collaborated to produce the single \\"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan&quot;. I had never even heard of Jimmy Tamborella, although I had already fallen in love with Ben Gibbard's melodic voice and melancholy lyrics. I now know that the aforementioned single was highly praised and I have read many reviews saying that Give Up fails as a whole to live up to that song. Honestly, I can't imagine how good \\"Evan and Chan&quot; must have been in order for it to top this album.<br />My first taste of The Postal Service came with the second track, \\"Such Great Heights\\". Listening to the song over and over, it became one of the greatest songs I have heard in awhile. But after listening to the opening track \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\", I could tell I would hear songs that only matched or exceed \\"Such Great Heights\\" in greatness. Tamborella's instrumentation combined with Gibbard's lyrical and vocal machinations provide a consistently inspiring album.<br />Although Gibbard's lyrics may seem a bit off at times (I can't accept that it's over: I will block the door / like a goalie tending the net in the third quarter / of a tied-game of rivalry), but he quickly regains the listener's respect with lyrics that remind us of our own personal failings (I feel I must interject here / you're getting carried away / feeling sorry for yourself with these revisions and gaps in history).<br />Give Up is the perfect album for any fan of ambient, poppy, smooth, melodic, crafty, original, upbeat, downbeat.... for any fan of good indie music. Gibbard and Tramborella create a perfect duo. Tramborella's electronic beats wonderfully complement Gibbard. This album is an example of great music that all bands of this genre should aspire too. The Postal Service may have some small kinks to work out, but none worth considering.<br />Buy this album and buy it now. It will woo you with its romantic lyrics and catchy tunes.
B0000026WD|5.0|In November of 1991, Michael Joe Jackson was once again going through a new phase as he had done some 12 years ago when he teamed up with Quincy Jones and together, those two created Off The Wall, Thriller and Bad. While their 10-year partnership created three of the greatest albums in music history, Michael Jackson still felt he needed to prove himself. At 33 years old, he was hungry for some blood. He had been introduced to Teddy Riley to help create a new style for him and his music. Many were quick to call him old hat by this point but after this release, things weren't exactly the same again as pop and R&amp;B/soul music goes. <br />A mixture of pop greatness, funk epic, R&amp;B head banger, soul healer, rock &amp; roll idoldom, new jack sensibility, great lyrics and of course the Otis Redding-inspired growls, the smooth tenor and of course that falsetto, mix them all up, put Michael Jackson in it and you have one of the greatest albums that was ever recorded and it isn't because I'm a MJ fan but it's really the truth.<br />This album was just a raw-sounding classic and it definitely was one album that you HAVE to GET UP and DANCE! And dance HARD as hell! Many of the essential jams in this baby definitely stand out from anything Michael had done previously. Songs like &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Why U Wanna Trip&quot;, &quot;In The Closet&quot;, &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;, &quot;Remember the Time&quot; (EVERYBODY was bumpin' this song back in the day!), and &quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot; were essential hip-hop/soul jams that still sounds like it could be released right now (check out Janet's Damita Jo album for example). Songs like &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Give In To Me&quot; are great examples of classic rock and alternative/grunge IMO. &quot;Heal the World&quot;, &quot;Will You Be There&quot;, and &quot;Keep The Faith&quot; are classic gospel. &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; is poetic-like pop. &quot;Who Is It&quot; is Gospel for the Soul of the Neglected (check &quot;This Place Hotel&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot; for further example) and &quot;Dangerous&quot; is a 6 1/2-minute funk epic! <br />This album definitely proved he can rise without the help of a producer...and at the same time CAN! Three cheers to Michael Jackson for this amazing album! HEE-HEE!
B00005JMEW|2.0|I like movies such as blade and Crouching tiger... and others, but this is out there. For the record this is one of the most ultra violent, bloody,and revengeful movies that I have ever seen.  It is Samurai Jack meets Charles Angel and Blade. The blood makes Jason, Halloween, Jeepers Creepers, and Aliens look tame by comparison. This movie is a super ultra-bloody, and violent. This is no way a compliment.  Although the fight scene are unbelievably cool and good, I hope no one is stupid enough to let their children watch this mess. This film could have been better.  The guts coming out is over the top.  I got the point that the guy had to die.
B000002L68|5.0|Prince...<br />That's all you can say, really. Prince is just simply a genius and back in the day he had a gang backing him up: The Revolution. And with this classic album and seminal masterpiece soundtrack/studio album released in 1984, Prince and these cats totally rocked the house with this album!<br />There are too many essential cuts on this muthasucka and no fillers. It's a genius piece of work. Twenty years later, Prince is still the baddest musician that ever lived and this album is still sooo good to listen to. <br />This is one of those albums where if you had only one of an artist's albums, this will be it by far!<br />&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; has to be one of the greatest songs EVER recorded, you can never get TIRED of it at all even if you try. And I haven't mention the brilliance of &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;, the majestic ballad, &quot;Beautiful Ones&quot;, the fabulous &quot;Darling Nikki&quot;, the glorifious and funky-as-hell &quot;Baby I'm A Star&quot; and the wonderful 8-minute opus of &quot;Purple Rain&quot; with its great guitar solo. <br />This is truly one HELL of an album! Congratulations to Prince for his recent induction to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame! Can't wait for the new album!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is the type of movie that either you get it, or you don't. Judging from the reviews here, it's probably about 50-50 that you will like it or hate it. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for a typical Bill Murray knee-slapper. Don't watch this movie if you're looking for typical Hollywood action, romance or cheesy cliche-filled story. Do watch this movie if you like watching films about people discovering themselves and life. Do watch this film if you like subtle, satirical humor done in a well-crafted way. Despite other reviews, this film isn't &quot;artsy,&quot; it just takes more thought than the average mass-audience picture that seems to have taken over the movie industry. I still like some of those types of films too, but this is a different type of film.
6305922756|4.0|The guy writing reviews under the name Leonard Snerdley is joking, right? He is sitting at home laughing at all the people who take his reviews seriously....right? <br />Spinal Tap is totally fictitious. They were invented solely for the purpose of this movie, which may not be one of the milestones of motion picture, but principal actors Harry Shearer (AKA Mr Burns), Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest are certainly very talented comedians, and even play their own instruments.<BR>The story is completely absurd, mocking the excesses of bands like Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Def Leppard, and numerous lesser gods. It's pretty funny, too.
0312995423|2.0|Note this review contains spoilers<br />I would rather give this 2 1/2 but since you can't I'll have to round down on this book, on account of having WAY too many plotholes.  Here's some of the more notable ones.<br />The idea of a &quot;rotating cleartext&quot; makes absolutely no sense. If decrypted text is still shifted into gibberish after inserting the encryption key, how can a rotating cleartext EVER be used on a practical level?<br />If the assassin in Spain was deaf, how did he know the names of all his victims?<br />Strathmore kills an innocent man who is trying to cut power because &quot;if Digital Fortress is going to be the NSA's new baby, he wants to be sure it's unbreakable!&quot;  Someone tell me why it matters if it's unbreakable or not?<br />Wasn't it a bit weird that Strathmore suddenly came to the revelation that Digital Fortress was fake at the EXACT same moment Susan did even though they were in completely seperate rooms?<br />ZIP is not an encryption algorithm<br />Digital Fortress is mildy entertaininf if you've got nothing else to read but there's alot of other stuff you could read first.
B0000C8AW7|4.0|This is another one of those albums that half of the &quot;reviewers&quot; aren't really going to review, they're just going to tell you how moronic the other reviewers' opinions are. <BR>A lot of people are going to insist upon loving this album to death, calling it Dylan's greatest achievement ever, and a lot of others are going to give it two stars and talk about how overrated and overly hyped it is. And none of them are going to write very much the album itself.<BR>Seriously, guys...just review the damn CD, okay?<br />&quot;Love And Theft&quot; is a good album. It's not a masterpiece along the lines of &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; or &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, and it doesn't have quite as many truly original or memorable songs as &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; either. <BR>But it is a solid collection of songs...Dylan is backed by a very good band, his way with words is still unmatched, and his cracked whisper of a voice possesses a lot of character. He may not have much of a voice, but he is actually a really fine singer.<br />There are a few pedestrian songs here; the kind you can't quite recall once they're finished playing. But the good ones certainly outnumber the mediocrities, like the excellent &quot;Mississippi&quot;, a vintage Dylan song which must be destined for classic status, the utterly charming &quot;Bye And Bye&quot;, the 30s-styled acoustic pop of &quot;Moonlight&quot;, the swinging &quot;Po' Boy&quot;, and the banjo-pickin' (!) &quot;High Water Everywhere (For Charley Patton)&quot;. <br />This is quite a gritty collection of songs, sparsely produced, mostly acoustic, and without the studio gloss that ruined some of Dylan's late-70s and early 80s albums. Drawing from blues, folk, and a little bit of jazz, country and prewar music hall, Bob Dylan has made a fine little record here, one that will grow on you if you give it some time.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Though I've never seen any other film by Tarantino, including Pulp Fiction, I'm very interested after watching this amazing movie starring Uma Thurman, called Kill Bill, Volume 1.<br />This movie's basically about a bride-to-be who finds herself waking up from a coma she's been in for 4 years, only to realize that the ones who she onced worked with, the ones who had orchestrated the plan to eliminate her, had stolen the one thing precious to her...her baby. Amazingly surviving a brutal beating and a shot to the head, Uma's character, codename &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, quickly sets out to seek revenge...her ultimate goal being to kill the one (who was the father of the baby), Bill.<br />This film is filled with comedy (thankfully, not to where it has so much that it ruins the movie), suspense, action, gross-out/outrageous scenes, and surprise after surprise! This movie will ultimately leave you wanting for more...and now that Volume 2's hit theatres, those wanting more will be satisfied. Volume 2 won't disappoint.<br />For all the bad things that have been said about her, Darryl Hannah (through both volumes) does an amazing job playing an one-eyed assassin whose goal's to ultimately defeat the &quot;greatest warrior she had ever encountered.&quot; Her character, Elle, is a slightly mysterious, yet creepy character who wants nothing more than to put an end to The Bride. But, nothing major will happen between Elle and Black Mamba until the second volume.<br />The action scenes in Kill Bill, Volume 1 are amazing! The fighting is something else...like...how could I describe it... &quot;perfected-fighting&quot; --- by this I mean, fighting that's interesting, stylish, and overall amazingly breathtaking. The action scenes are that outrageous and they'll leave you wanting for more. Uma has some pretty interesting battles, including a major one between Lucy Lui's character and the &quot;Crazy 8&quot; group, as well as the back-up group, the &quot;Crazy 88&quot; .... The Crazy8 really is crazy....the creepiest member being a young girl named Gogo wielding a spiked steel mace that also has razor blades sticking out of it....'What she lacks of in years is made up for in madness'... something to that effect, anyway.<br />Kill Bill, Volume 1 is basically an outstanding movie that movie lovers have been longing for... a movie about revenge, filled with lots of action, some comedy, and a plot which anyone could relate to...seeking revenge on those who take the most treasured thing away from you.<br />A definite two thumbs-up! 5 Stars for the first volume of Kill Bill!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|THE MUSIC TAKES YOU AWAY<BR>PURE BLUES<BR>GREAT INTERPRETATION BY ERIC CLAPTON<BR>WORTH EVERY PENNY
B00003CXWV|5.0|This movie is great for the simple fact that it shows how easily cocaine was brought into the US it was very funny and exciting for me to watch i think there was agreat performance by Johnny Depp the movie kept going it didnt leave you behind it didnt get boring to me anyway. it shows how easily money can manipulate people it shows how the american dream isnt all that it really is cracked up to be and how to choose your paths wisely but the movie on the other hand shows that no matter how big you think you get theres always some body bigger it's like in scarface &quot;lesson number 1 don't underestimate the other guys greed&quot; and i think george jung found that out the hard way. the dvd is great the special feats. are great its infinifilm so they are really cool there are interviews w/ the real George Jung and all in all the movie was great if like scarface youll probably love this movie
6303443214|5.0|For my money, this has got to be best vampire movie ever made. It's well written, well directed, and well acted. Casting Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt as Lestat and Louis was a stroke of genius, they're both beautiful enough to fit the parts. One of the best aspects of the film was the backdrop and scenery. In every single scene, there's something gorgeous in it. Like the breathtaking mansion that Louis inhabits at the beginning of the movie and also the scenes at the Theater Des Vampires. I also like the way the characters deal with death and grief and how evident the effect of all the things that happen to them are in their expressions and voices. I paticularly like the look on Louis' face when Claudia's ashes are swirling around his face.
0312263120|3.0|This book has nothing to do with &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Moreover, it is full of inaccuracies (for example, Dan Brown states that the Nagasaki bomb did not use plutonium as its fissionable matter) and is more worthy of a beginner author. If you really want to read some good tech-spy-thrillers go to the pros, such as Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum.<br />The reason I did give it three stars and not less is that it did help me pass many hours waiting in the airport for my flight. That is, the book as a thriller is basically good. However, if you're expecting something like &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; or just a good, accurate, realistic, researched thriller, don't waste your time with this book.
0812548094|1.0|If you are looking for a way to kill a few days reading an below par book then this is the one to get.  This author does his best to drag out a book that should be no long than 400-500 pages into one almost 1000.  He does so by repeating lines of characters over and over, adding in openings for future books, and constantly describing Richard and Kahlan's feelings for each other.  <br />These books have the weakest plot line I have ever seen and left me with a bad taste in my mouth for wasting the 12hrs it took to read.  The author seemed to focus more on side plots in order for him to write even more crappy books than on actually getting to the point and finishing this one. <br />Dont read these books.  Instead look into George R.R. Martin.
B000001E18|5.0|Most people I've spoken to have either thought this was an absolute must for any album collection, or should be used as a coaster.<br />Personally, I find it an extraordinary invention of sound and music that broke new ground.  If you liked the singles &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;, you won't be able to turn this cd off.  It helps if you went to one of the ZooTV concerts or have heard remixes of these songs, as that's the only way you'll appreciate just how brilliant this album is - anything that can be remixed a number of times in different genres and sound so spectacular across the board is very rare.<br />Equal to &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; for my tastes, and that's a big wrap.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Yeah, they're derivative.  But in this day and age, who isn't?  And frankly, I would far rather listen to a great, funny, fresh band like Jet than the recycled junk of Britney Spears or any of the other highly popular &quot;artists&quot; that are floating around out there.  Jet has put out a CD that is so much fun that it is positively infectious.  &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl,&quot; regardless of what it's influenced by, never fails to get me wanting to stand up and dance, and the same goes for &quot;Cold Hard B****.&quot;  Their ballads, like &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; and &quot;Move On&quot; are far better than I would have expected. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps, for some- for others, it's just a great time.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is one of the most entertaining action movies I've seen in years, though it's very graphic &amp; violent... so definitely not for kids. I'd include it in a list of my top 10 favorites. Uma is amazing here, wow, she kicks major a**. This movie has a very beautiful style to it. The music was enjoyable and fits the movie perfectly. I'll probably buy the soundtrack as well. I rented this movie then returned it, only to buy it the same day, it's that good. I didnt really care for a few things: the switching to black &amp; white then color again- because the color in this movie is fantasic, the occasional subtitles- I always have to pause the movie to read what they say cuz it's so fast, however I can understand and respect the director's reasoning for it to keep Kill Bill's authentic japanese feel, and also the japanese anime- I didn't come to watch cartoons. Visually this movie is amazing though!! It blew me away. I really liked the plot and I thought all the actors did a great job. The stunts and sword fights are top notch. (Uma's steel is sweet huh?) The DVD features both Dolby Digital &amp; DTS 5.1  The &quot;special features&quot; are really lacking here unfortunately. Bonus performances by the &quot;5,6,7,8's&quot;? You're joking right? I really wish they would've made this a 2 disc collector's edition (like Pulp Fiction), but I imagine they probably will a few months down the road. Special note to the genius director...Please keep making movies Mr.Tarantino!! Your fans want a Kill Bill volume 3,4,5,6,7,8 too. Anyways, this movie rocks. Highly Recommended!
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is the only group whose music consistently sends chills up my spine when I hear them play live. Damien's way with words and a guitar are truly lovely and touching. The range of Lisa's voice is unimaginable, that is until you hear it. This is what I imagine an angel would sound like if they were ever given vocal chords. I will miss the small venues as this band gets better known, and they will. It is only a matter of time. I look forward to their next CD.
0671891634|4.0|In my opinion, this book was a lot more readable than I would have expected a book about the stock market to be.  The light humor (very light) kept the book interesting and there were plenty of good tips.  The &quot;20 Golden Rules&quot; were great. Lynch obviously knows what he's doing and he proves it by giving real life examples from his own successful experience.  The only setback I found was that the tips were made out to be really easy, but they sounded tough.  Overall, though, I would recommend it to both beginners and pros involved in the stock market.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I won't embarrass myself and say how many time I have seen this gem, but this is one of the best films I have ever seen - funny, sweet, touching - the whole package and standout acting. Do yourself a favor a snag a copy for you and a loved one.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Top Secret! is a hilarious movie from the makers of airplane. The jokes are so funny you'll puke. The visual humor is also extremely great. All acting is great and an all around great DVD to own.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|After listening to Edguy's Vain Glory Opera, I wasn't terribly impressed. However, after listening to Hellfire Club .. my view of Edguy turned completely around. Think Def Leppard... think metal ... think progressive. Add them all together and you'll get this great CD. I was not unsatisfied with any of the tracks, each track had it's own exclusive &amp; distinguished style. &quot;We Don't Need a Hero&quot; is one of the best songs I've heard of it's type. If you want a good prog. metal CD, you have found it. Get Hellfire Club!
B00000JCOV|4.0|I'll be honest. At first, I didn't think much of this album. I didn't hate it, I found some of the songs catchy and interesting, but it didn't blow me away initially. Well, this is definitely the kind of cd that gets better the more you listen to it. It's most effective as a way of releasing anger; whether at a person or a certain group of people, or at the world at general (And we all get those feelings; it's just that some people are better at dealing with it than others). The members of Slipknot have found a way to deal with it...through their music. You have to dig deep and pay attention to the lyrics. This is not packaged angst. Listen to Corey's voice (which ranges from actual melodic singing to a rumbling growl) and you'll hear the torture in it. People who criticize the so-called &quot;whining&quot; can't possibly relate to it and just maybe, they're the kind of people that Corey sings/screams about. There are even hints at self mutilation (As found in the song &quot;Tattered and Torn&quot;) and it's indicative of where the frontman is coming from, and it's nothing short of gripping.<br />Musically, the other eight members may not be exactly groundbreaking, but they work very well as a cohesive unit. Some may argue that some pieces are unnecessary (i.e. two extra percussionists, a sampler and even a DJ), and I know that some songs don't make full use of these members; which is understandable since there's so much going on to produce the sound; but when you hear them, you'll know why they're there. Perhaps the only other minor complaint I have is that it's difficult to hear the bass at times, due to the guitars and other elements drowning out the sound, so its presence turns out to be more subtle, but still effective when it rises above the murk.<br />Some people also criticize Slipknot for being too &quot;commercial.&quot; Now, I know this isn't &quot;true&quot; metal, as in the likes of Dimmu Borgir, Slayer, Iron Maiden, etc., perhaps because Slipknot has a slight rap influence (not to mention the DJ and the sampler), but they are still far away from the likes of Limp Bizkit and similiar bands. They do have a metallic influence, but even if they're not heavy enough to be &quot;true&quot; metal, they're still one of the better hard rock bands out there today. Yes, they have more exposure, but that doesn't mean that everybody likes them. Of course, they're not for everybody, but approach it with an open mind, and you may find it to your liking.<br />Even though a band's primary intention is to make music, they're going to make money no matter what. The strange irony may be that Slipknot is getting paid for exorcising their demons through their music, but that's only because of the work they put into it, and people who buy the music, they need an outlet for their problems. This major label debut, the independently released &quot;Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat&quot; before that, &quot;Iowa&quot;, and the upcoming &quot;Vol 3. The Subliminal Verses&quot; sum up Slipknot's career. And if Vol.3 is indeed their last album, then at least they're going out on top.slight rap influence (not to mention the DJ and the sampler), but they are still far away from the likes of Limp Bizkit and similiar bands.

B00003CXCT|5.0|No film, let alone a series of films, has been released on home video as often as \\"Star Wars.\\"  I personally own three versions of the film: the original release, the THX remastering and the special edition.  What does not cease to amaze me is, in spite of this, the never-ending complaining about the special editions.  *This* is how Lucas wanted the original films to look like and since this is *his* story, not yours, and he's allowed to do whatever he wants.<br />Stop your whining.  Buy the DVDs or don't buy the DVDs, I don't think any of us really cares.  If you buy them and you still insist you need to watch the original version then dust off your VCR and pop the tapes in.  Let the rest of us enjoy what is clearly going to be an amazing experience without your constant belly-aching.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|Well, now that this film is out on DVD, I finally got the chance to see it.  I must have missed its showing in Philadelphia.  I had heard so much about it and rented the DVD with much anticipation.  I wasn't let down at all!  After viewing, I purchased my own copy right away to add to my collection.<br />I was in college in the mid-late 1980's in North Jersey not far from NYC so I was at least familiar with the setting, Reagonomics and the ME decade of the 80s.  It is very easy to see just how this all happened.<br />Now, on to the film itself.   I watched with trepidation to see \\"little\\" Mac (that adorable little boy from Home Alone) in his comeback role as an adult actor.  Could he pull it off? YOU BET!  With beads and feathers to boot!   He really prepared well for the film and did an awesome job recreating the now infamous Michael Alig.  He's a long way from Home Alone now and I'm so glad.  Give a real actor a meaty role and just watch him sink his teeth into it...and that is just what Mac does...over and over again.<br />Seth Green, playing James St. James, the author of the book on which the film is based is also a hoot!  I have never quite seen him like this.  He truly WAS a queen in this film...so convincing in his role.  <br />And finally, Marilyn Manson.  Well, I really didn't know WHAT to expect from him, this being his first film.  What can I say about his performance as Christina, a trangendered Niko-influenced party girl?  Brilliant!  And WAY too short.  I would have loved to have seen more of him.  Perhaps he can write and produce HER story to bring to the screen next?  I'd love it!  <br />See this film...but when you do, fasten your seatbelts because you are in for a ride that is....well...sick, twisted and....FABULOUS!
B0001I55OC|4.0|The scenery and the action scenes were great, but the romance was a bit sappy. The movie was also very well acted, especially lead actor Paul Walker.
B00006879E|5.0|'Songs About Jane' is one of he best CD purchases I've made in awhile. Even after hearing the first two amazing singles from Maroon 5 ('Harder to Breathe' and 'This Love'), I was slightly reluctant to buy the album. It seems quite rare today to find a CD in which the filler tracks are just as good as, or even better than, the singles. Thankfully, I was not disappointed at all. In fact, it seems as though 'Songs About Jane' has found a permanent place in my CD changer (as opposed to an album that's great upon first listen, but gets thrown to the bottom of the pile soon afterwards). <br />Although every track is very funky and very fresh, each is still very unique and they all have different strong points. Although I am very aware of the fact that 'She Will Be Loved' is very corny, it has quickly become one of my favorite tracks. Call me crazy, but I'm always struck by high school lyrics (&quot;I don't mind spending everyday/Out on your corner in the pouring rain...&quot;), sad vocals, and music that sounds as though it's been influenced heavily by rain. 'The Sun', 'Must Get Out', 'Sunday Morning' (which I clearly remember hearing in the film 'Something's Gotta Give'), 'Through With You', and 'Not Coming Home' are also my favorites off of the album. 'Secret' is also a great track, and I absolutely love it's lyrics. They're very simple, but they're sang with such strength and expression, that they really strike me. These lyrics could possibly be my favorite lines from the entire album...<br />&quot;I know I don't know you<BR>But I want you, so bad<BR>Everyone has a secret<BR>Can they keep it?<BR>Oh, no they can't.&quot;   <br />On the whole, I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves the singles (as most of my friends are already aware). Believe me, chances are, you won't be disappointed.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Getting a kick out of all the Rock Star wannabee's bashing the White Stripes. If they are sooooo bad, why don't you make a better CD and make millions. It's clear the WS's do this out of love for the music, I doubt they could care if they sold 2 CD's. They doing it for themselves, not you.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I don't see how anyone can think the music at the end of the SE ROTJ could be cheesier than the music it replaced. Listen to the original with the lyrics - it's hideous! Star Wars was my childhood, but I cringed every time I heard that music!<br />I'm reserving judgement for this release until I see it, so I'm giving it 3 stars for now. I have no problem with revising a work, if the changes are for the better (after all, even Tolkien revised the Hobbit, completely changing Gollum's role). I've heard that Lucas is still tweaking it - let's hope he changes the Greedo thing back to the original version.
B000001IPP|5.0|The 2nd official record (1994) from the Californian punx and their best album!<br /> This classical of punk rock mix all the direct street punk sound<BR>roots from their first album Rancid(1993) and the 7'' with techinicians that given a touch in the songs like they did later<BR>in and out come the wolves (1996)<br />...and of course...this one marks too the first rancid record w/Lars F. and his amazing vocals.<br /> There's a curiosity about 2 songs in this CD that some people won't notice: The songs Harry Bridges and Motorcycle Ride.<br /> -Harry Bridges 1rst verse its the same verse already sung in their first cd in the song Union Blood (1RST VERSE:bloody thursady,was july5th the pigs killed three works Harry Bridges....etc)<br /> -Motorcycle Ride first verse and 2nd verse, except for the chorus, these verses are the same 1first verse of the music TIME BOMB later recorded in and out come the wolves. Tim sings a lot faster and almoust incoprehensive (if you wanna make a move then you better come in...etc)<br /> Amazing songs,probably the best songs ever recorded by rancid are here!
B000002HH2|5.0|One day, I just kind of thought to myself, &quot;You know, self, I've seen a lot of Björk on TV, I wonder what her music's like?&quot; So I asked a friend of mine who likes her what album I should buy. Without hesitating she said the first album she'd reccomend would be this one, Post. So, I bought it not sure what to expect, but I was blown away!<br />Björk's originality is something so...rare! There are original artists, then there's Björk. Her music is a breed of sound I've never heard before, it makes me feel ways I never did! I love the range of styles there is even on this CD alone! The album begins with a powerful techno-rockish type song, &quot;Army of Me,&quot; its beat is so consuming! Then before you know it you feel like you're listening to a musical with &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot;! I love the way she sings a big band type song, but adds her twist to it.<br />There's not song on this CD I don't like, and like my friend did for me, I'll reccomend it to you!
0446530891|4.0|A quick and suspenseful read with quite a complex plot. Worth a good bedtime read!
B00008J4P5|5.0|It kills me that whenever a band achieves overwhelming popularity, some people feel compelled to explain at length how much said band sucks, how little talent they have, how everyone's going to realize they suck after a few years have passed... well, in some (or many) cases I'm sure that's true, although usually widespread critical acclaim is more meaningful than widespread popularity.  You know, there aren't a lot of respectable critics extolling the virtues of Britney or Fred Durst.  But anyway...<br />I don't listen to radio.  I'm 40 years old.  I have only a vague idea of what's hip and what isn't.  I listen to what I like.  So while you may not like this band, don't tell me they have no talent... that only tells me that you're clueless.  And don't tell me that I'll suddenly wake up five years from now and &quot;realize&quot; that I was duped by all the hype and this albumn really sucks.  Sorry, but I don't listen to hype and I don't judge music by what others say.  If I like it today, then I'll continue to like it ten years from now.  Two of my all-time favorite bands are King's X and Varttina...  I did not decide that I liked them because they were overwhelmingly popular.<br />I find a few cds a year that I can listen to all the way through and completely enjoy them.  Those are cds that I will be listening to forever.  For example, I still listen to &quot;New Gold Dream&quot; by Simple Minds, because it was (and still is) a brilliant cd.  I listen to &quot;Gretchen Goes to Nebraska&quot; by King's X, because it's still one of the best rock cds I've ever heard.<br />Elephant is a cd I can listen to, all the way through, over and over.  I do admit that the Little Acorns track gets annoying... but most of the cd is simply brilliant.<br />So... some people here want to predict that, once the hype fades, this cd will fall into obscurity.  I'd say, on the contrairy, after the hype fades, some of those who had avoided it will come to realize how really good it is.  You know, I haven't decided all these years later that U2's Joshua Tree really sucked and I was just blinded by all the hype... I still think it's a brillaint disc.  And I'll still be listening to Elephant years from now... as will a lot of people, because it doesn't suck and the White Stripes really do have talent... quite a lot of it.
0792163710|5.0|Please regard this as a postscript to the many fine reviews of this mastepiece.<br />Alan Ladd was one of those great actors who might have been. Ladd's deadpan persona, which some have criticized as wooden, was the essential element in the suppressed emotion which would serve him so well in his greatest role, that of Shane.<br />In following Ladd's filmography, it's fascinating to see how the quality of his work is related to the complexity of the character he plays. The more complex, it seems, the better Ladd's performance. And of course, the enigma of Shane, the character's inherent complexity, lends itself perfectly to Ladd's talents.<br />Sue Carol, Alan Ladd's wife and agent, didn't care for directors, preferring the actor-as-producer rather than director. While this &quot;business approach&quot; contributed to great wealth and influence for the Ladd dynasty, it did not lend itself to the artistic achievements of which Ladd was capable. Whether this was of concern to Alan can only be conjectured.<br />However, one thing is certain, when Ladd was given a strong director, such as Raoul Walsh, Michael Curtiz, Edward Dmytryk or George Stevens for Shane, the results were dramatic. What may have been his finest performance was also his last, in Dmytryk's The Carpetbaqggers. As the enigmatic Nevada Smith, was Alan Ladd replaying Shane?

B000003N8R|5.0|I own about 20 Coltrane releases. They are all amazing in different ways.<br />But CRESCENT get played the most. Why?<br />CRESCENT is about having power and not using it. Trane proved he could scream and burn, years before. But here, there is a beautiful restraint...thoughtful but deeply emotional.<br />For example: when Trane's solo on &quot;Wise One&quot; builds to a peak, it sounds like he is almost accidentally overcome by emotion. It's not an intentional scream; more like he is speaking quietly, then inadvertently sobs, without planning to.<br />And on the title track, the intensity comes not from raw power, but from how long and winding Trane's melodic lines are....so complex, but so clear and effortless.<br />The clarity of his musical conception is simply staggering.<br />This album makes me think of someone or something looking down on humanity from above, and smiling a bit sadly, sweetly.<br />Really, this album is about love.<br />What is love?<br />Listen to CRESCENT and think about it.
0380789035|4.0|Weighing in at four hundred and sixty-one pages, rich in theme, inventive, researched and encompassing a massive vision, this book certainly seems like a kind of opus, but although it's a great read, I still think that Gaiman is capable of better.<br />His instinct is for escapist fantasy, showcased so well in Neverwhere, and American Gods is full of excess. Just as one phantasmagoric scene begins to settle in the mind, another is immediatley pitched at the reader, upsetting any sense of realism that might have developed. Granted, a novel about godhood in contemporary America can't be held to strictly realistic standards, but really skilled psuedo-fantasy can still have that urgent 'this is happening' sense, and American Gods often doesn't. The weakness is made more acute by the occasional moments of absolute realism, scenes involving ordinary people, which don't fit right with the rest of the novel. The impression I was left with was one of immaturity: 'Wow, wouldn't it be cool if all the classical Gods were just entities conjured up by people's minds, and still existed today?' But this would be forgivable, as in Neverwhere, if not for the novel's more realistic pretenstions, and a kind of seriousness it seems to aim for in the final chapters.<br />All that aside, Gaiman is a spectacular writer, and the setpieces of the novel have a cinematic quality. The writing is vivid and fluid throughout. The only scene which really seemed weak and difficulty to visualize (unfortunatley) was the climactic battle.<br />I'm still waiting on that masterpiece, and I am confident it will arrive.
B00005JMEW|3.0|And for a start, another reviewer said that Tarantino only ever did a commentary for FROM DUCK TILL DAWN, whereas in fact he recorded a superb one for the director's cut of TRUE ROMANCE, which again he didn't direct. So perhaps he refuses to do commentary on just his own films.<br />On the film, the soundtrack is superb, in fact I believe the soundtrack is better than the film, and it is a spectacular film, and from anyone but him it would be outstanding. But you shouldn't expect PULP FICTION and it isn't. Brash and bloody and even arrogant at times with the editing style (the b/w and color transition timed with Uma's blink for instance) it is worthy of repeat viewings but not in the same leafue as RD or JB.<br />The DVD is boring and uneventful, rent this one until the SE comes out. The three stars here comes from probably a 4 for the movie and a two for the dvd.
B00005JMNA|3.0|At first I was skeptical about seeing this film, as it's sort of like a remake of the original Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze. However, I was impressed by it. Clearly it wasn't a completely original plot, but being set in Havana in the late 50's during the days leading up to the Cuban Revolution definately gave it flavor. I thought that the performances by Diego Luna and Romola Garai were excellent, and their chemistry was just great. They made it so believable. The music and the dancing is fascinating, however like most films with dancing, it's unfortunate that the editing tends to take away from seeing the dance routines in their entirety, but it's still impressive. All in all, I'd say this film is enjoyable, especially if you liked the first Dirty Dancing and enjoy cuban music and dancing. There's nothing deep about it, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is satisfying enough as it is for its genre.
B000002JNJ|5.0|A band who made it big without radio or television hosting, Pantera made some of the best albums in the metal industry today, noteably 'Cowboys From Hell'. With sound-proof guitaring from Dimebag Darrell, machine gun drumming from Vinne Paul, hard-hitting bass riffs from Rex Brown and incredible vocals from Phil Anselmo this album is everything a heavy metal fan could want. However, still inspired by the glam scene of the early 80's it's evident in some songs with Anselmo screaming out in a very glam rock style. The album is full-on thrash and heavy metal with the exception of 'Cemetary Gates' which shows Anselmos wide range of vocals and Dimebags endless skills with a guitar. An album, a band like no other, Pantera got their claim to fame by constant touring and hard work. A band who never sold out to the corporate music business to make their money. If you like Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer etc. then you'll love Pantera. If you are after music from a band with power then 'Cowboys From Hell' is for you.
0380002930|5.0|...long enough to get through the first chapter.<br />Only an adult reader can grasp the entirety of this book. It touches on politics, mysticism, ecology, and the Darwinian struggle to survive. This would be an amazing enough book if its characters were humans. That Adams can make it work from rabbits' point of view is nothing short of incredible. If you give it a chance, it will entertain the most serious reader.
0316666343|2.0|I found this book to be rather disturbing and emotional to the point that I would put it down only to pick it up again based on the fact that so many of my friends found it a good read.  I admit that the idea of a young girl narrating from her idea of what Heaven is was a good one.  Watching her family and the trials they go through after her murder was a different way to show us how death effects different people.  With that said I must admit that I had a hard time caring how Mom, sister Lindsay, and the rest of the motley crew felt or how the death of susie affected the different characters in the end.  Susie's mom was probably the most unlikeable character in my opinion, and I wanted to like her since I am also a mother and could not imagine for one second how I would feel if one of my children was taken from me in such a violent way.  The way she just shut down on everyone (including her two other children) and turned to the police detective was in my opinion what turned me off to her.<br />Still I continued to read this book only to be totally let down by the ending.  I hope my next read by this author is not such a let down.
B000002MUW|5.0|I may part of the few but proud when I say that this is my favorite madonna album of all time.  I'm not a HUGE madonna fan.  I categorize myself as a 'casual' fan.  I'm more of a Janet Jackson/ funk pop/dance music fan.  But this CD is awesome.  &quot;Don't Stop&quot; makes me move as soon as I hear it's intro beats, &quot;Secret&quot; is a classic and &quot;Human Nature&quot; gives the good ole' Madonna FINGER to her critcs of that time (who were MANY.) <br />This CD is artisically strong and her voice is very is very melodic throughout.  I don't care what people say about her voice, I think it's  unique and pleasant to listen to.  This is just one of the CD's that sets a certain undescribable mood while you listen to it, and it's a good one. =)
B0001BKAEY|2.0|It's a trend, a fashion statement, it's business.<br />But not a movie.<br />I am soooo tired of people being enthusiastic about plain crap!<br />No doubt the trilogy comes to an end.<br />No doubt a lot of work went into it.<br />The best of it is its music (I mean the original score).<br />The rest is at best forgettable.<br />It stems from a contorted mind of a spoiled child, who had too many ecstasy pills, acid, or some other fluffy stuff snorted up its nose.<br />The best of the three remains the original &quot;The Matrix&quot;.<br />It had an original story which made perfect sense and which was refreshing in its plot twists.<br />But &quot;Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Revolutions&quot; are both plain stupid and unnecessary sequels, only produced to create a trend or a fashion and therefore make money out of gullible people.<br />Perhaps it is just me who finally sympathizes with Agent Smith, rather than with the wimpy Neo.<br />I never understood the fascination with a Messiah or for a &quot;chosen one&quot;, which I find utterly dull and diminishing for the human race as thinking, breathing and creative individuals.<br />This is perhaps why Germans followed a Bohemian corporal, to be their leader in the '30s.<br />Nevertheless, the sequels are an offence to any well-read individual, who knows something about classic literature, mythology, theology, philosophy and above all, Wagner's tetralogy, created from the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.<br />There is a mass of cross-cultural, cross-religious and cross-mythological references and deja-vus in them, that my head started to spin in disbelief.<br />From Lewis Carroll's own &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, to Nitsche's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; and from Greek and German (or Nordic if you like) mythology to far eastern Bhuddism and Zen beliefs, through a good dose of theatrics borrowed from &quot;The Ring of the Nibelungen&quot;, anything goes here.<br />Anything, but true imagination and original creativity.<br />In comparison, the other trilogy, taken from Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is far better, far more entertaining than this monstrously over-stretched MTV-clip.<br />I simply cannot understand that mature people can even contemplate these as movies.<br />They are just another fine example of Barnum &amp; Bailey's Circus of special effects, nothing more.<br />But then again, in this computerized world, taste is a matter of the beholder: usually that of a machine, not that of a thinking human being in flesh and blood.<br />No wonder then, that there are already some nuts out there, who are willing to allow electronic implants to be inserted in their bodies, if not directly in their brains...<br />Why not become machines ourselves?<br />We are so afraid of ageing and about the notion of death, that we would sell our souls to live forever.<br />But be careful what you wish for, you may get it.<br />The only glitch is, will eternal life truly be what one expects it to be?<br />What if, instead of eternal life in health and prosperity, everything gets turned around, and you are forced into a life of mysery, sickness and doom?<br />Would you still want to live forever?<br />And now back to these movies, which would have been far more interesting, if they had followed this train of thought, rather than going into a limbo of action-packed mayhem, only slightly dusted with some messianic philosophy, and peppered with a lot of mythological revisitations.<br />In my view, and believe me when I say so, they are just a waste of money and time.<br />Still I own them all. You may wonder why.<br />Well, I expected a truly fascinating continuation to the first and best one and instead, &quot;Reloaded&quot; was just that: reloaded.<br />Then I thought to myself, oh well, the middle section of a story is never so enticing as the first, so let's see how it ends, and alas to my stupor I was confirmed what I feared the most: the second was truly just the first part of the third.<br />Still I am thinking: is it possible that we are so stupid as to allow machines to rule us, or worse, that we will regress so much in our intelligence, as to allow the domination of machines over us?<br />Using a tool or a machine for our convenience is not a bad thing, but to allow it to monopolize who we are, what we think or what we do, that's truly evil.<br />Perhaps, this is the true and final message of the Warchowski Brothers, but this is just my guess and I doubt that if such a thing would happen, a Messiah would rise to save us.<br />No intelligent being would ever save a race of idiots, who have relinquished their freedom for some opportunistic comfort.<br />Especially not a Divine being at that!<br />I gave it, them, 2 stars, just because of the effort made, but if I were you, and still interested in buying a Matrix movie, I'd stick to the original one and would just forget that it is part of a trilogy.<br />It stands pretty well on its own.<br />My apologies go to all those I may have offended by my harsh words, but I had to vent my thoughts on these products, which to me are still not worth to bear the name of movie.<br />If you like entertainment of this sort, but by far more sophisticated and not so trashy, I'd recommend the two X-Men movies.<br />Now, there's a couple which can rightfully be called movies.<br />Even though based on Comic strips, they have something that Matrix lacks: humanity.<br />Beautiful imagery, excellent and convincing acting, beautiful music (far from the hammering and monotonous music of Don Davis), and special effects that match the eye.<br />If ever, then try to rather get hold of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, which I have mentioned before.

B000005JA8|4.0|Not the album, but the scores of &quot;music fan&quot;s who will rant about how non sensical and terrible this album is, how it is devoid of effort and is just plain &quot;garbage&quot;, yet will write a review in which these very same adjectives can be applied. Irony is in full form on this website. This is why professional critics still exist no matter how much we berate them and tell them how pointless their jobs are; they can actually be articulate in their observations on music they love, hate, or just plain don't care about. I went through 5 pages of reviews on this album and only saw one worth reading. And it wasn't a particularly glowing review (the one titled &quot;construction&quot;), not even one I would agree with at this point, but he or she took the time to make the concise points that they wanted to make and that's all that matters. Your crusades to uphold some infalted sense of purity in a scene which you have absolutely no control over are petty, plain and simple. And just remember, the idea of perfection exists within a preconstructed set of sensibilities, so the quest to achieve that goal is self defeating. We'd be much pretty sick of that sort of music before it ever came close, so why even bother. <br />I have not listened to the album enough to make an accurate attempt at rating, but my first impressions were good, so i'll give it 4 stars for the time being and perhaps i will write a real review in the near future. I just felt i had to get this off my chest because it really bothered me as I was looking for any real opinions on this difficult album. But just to make a quick point, they had been rehearsing these songs for 8-9 months before they sat down in one 9 hour session and played them, much like Ornette Coleman did with his band before he recorded &quot;Free Jazz&quot;. Effortless is not a good word to describe this album. Critique what's there, not what isn't.
B000002KD9|4.0|I must admit that I'm not very familiar with the extensive Neil Young catalouge. I have been presented to his music many times, and liked a lot of what I heard; but I somehow never really got \\"into\\" it. I liked his contributions to Buffalo Springfield very much; his songs were generally by far the strongest there.<br /><br />I decided to take a chance on one of his earliest solo album, and coincidentially I chose \\"After the Gold Rush\\" which could be achieved very cheap at that time.<br /><br />I recognized tracks like \\"Southern Man\\" and \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down\\" but the rest of the album I had never really noticed.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me Why\\", which opens the album, is song in the same vein as his world-wide hit record \\"Heart of Gold\\" - a good song, but not as good as the hit record.<br /><br />Excitment begins with the title track, great tune and a highlight. The waltzy \\"Only Love Can Break\\" is also great. \\"Southern Man\\" is probably best known from the Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young \\"Fout Way Street\\"; I think I prefer their version to this one.<br /><br />His cover version of Don Gibson`s \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" is very personal, and musically far from the orginal.<br /><br /> \\"Don`t Let it Bring You Down\\" is simply great! \\"Birds\\" is also a great track - very moving!<br /><br />I find the rest of the album is a little lame; \\"When You Dance You Can Really Love\\" has a good guitar-riff; but otherwise it does not do much for me. \\"I Believe in You\\" and \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\" are just okay.<br /><br />All in all this is a very good album; maybe not as outstanding as some reviewers seem to think. Unfortunately it has a rather short playing time, but that`s typical of albums from that period.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well George Lucas edited the movies. I'm sure no director ever edits the movies and make them something other than what we saw at the theater. Come to think of it I can name you a great number of Director's Cuts. So why should this be different? Granted I too wish that they included both the original and modified versions. All I can say is that I'm ecstatic this is finally coming out on DVD. It is still the best Trilogy to me and it has tough competition with the Harry Potter and Lord of the Ring trilogies.<br /><br />I enjoy the new releases but the magic of the original three movies can't be beat. When I saw the original Star Wars at the theater in 1977 it was not Chapter IV A New Hope. It was just Star Wars. In fact I went to see it fourteen times. It was the best thing I had ever seen. I even bought all the Star Wars toys I could find even though I was an adult. Am I complaining about more movies or editing? No, quite the contrary. Why would I complain about Mr. Lucas making five more movies to carry on the saga? You can bet I have pre-ordered my set.<br /><br />You will not believe how crisp and sharp the picture and sound quality are in these movies. They did a magnificent job of transferring these to DVD. So many extras, where do I begin? Deleted scenes, cast interviews, bios, documentary, directors comments, and more. This set is so chocked full of goodies you will think it is Christmas. The documentary about what George Lucas went through to make these movies is incredible. His sacrifice has made millions happy. There is some interesting information on all the companies he helped form to make these movies possible. The movies alone had you ready to buy but when you see all the extras you will know you made the right decision. Speaking of Christmas, if one of your friends is short on cash and doesn't get it, be sure you get it for them as a gift.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|I watched Re-Loaded in the theater and was overcome by the amount of psycobabble that I could not enjoy the action. When this came out on DVD, I decided I liked it. It was not really that bad, except for the &quot;to be continued.&quot;<br />Then came Revolutions. I had high hopes for this. I wondered how it would end because I had this idea that what was concidered the &quot;real-world&quot; was actually another extension of the Matrix. I think that would have made a great ending. Anyway, I watched the movie and quickly became dissappointed and bored. Halfway in the movie, no progress was made to reveal the plot, then the seemingly endless battle of Zion takes place.<br />SPOLIERS AHEAD:<br />I have to admit the ending of the movie caught me by surpize. Having Neo make a deal with the machines shows that third option that was not present in Re-loaded. Non the less, there is no reason why this film could not have been merged with Re-loaded. In summary, what is wrong with Revolutions<br />1. No plot development during the first half of the movie<br />2. The Zion battle sequence was much too long and kind of over the top.<br />3. Trinity and Neo die. I understand Neo dying, but what was the purpose of Trinity dying? Cannot figure that out! I would think her seeing the Sun then returning to Zion will offer hope to the humans.<br />4. I can't help but loose pace with the different body of the Oracle. Yes they tried to cover this in the script, but it did not work for me.<br />5. I miss the twins. Those guys were cool!<br />6. What is with the fight scene between Smith and Neo? That was way too &quot;video gamey&quot; to me. Kinda silly actually.<br />What is right with Revolutions:<br />1. It does end eventually.<br />2. I bought it at Amazon, so I saved a few bucks.<br />3. If I cannot sleep at night, I'll put this on.<br />4. If someone I dislike asks me for a movie recommendation, I will recommend Revolutions.<br />I will agree with almost everyone here - The Matrix origional is by all means the best of the three. From there, its downhill.l means the best of the three. From there, its downhill.

B0001I55OC|1.0|After months of procrastination, I finally got around to finishing the book of Michael Crichton's TIMELINE. I thought it was amazing, an absolute must-read. I waited until after I had finished the book to watch the movie, because I didn't want my mind tainted by a director's vision. I realize now that that director's vision needs contact lenses.<br />There are so many things wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start.<br />The first thing that's wrong is the intro scenes. The entire sequence of the man appearing in the road and dying at the hospital is completely rushed, and might as well not have been included in the film. The connection between the man and the dig at Castlegard is completely obliterated.<br />Another thing that bothered me was the relationship between Chris and the professor, which is described as fatherly in the book, not as the professor actually BEING his father - a fabrication of the screenwriter. Kate isn't supposed to realize that Chris has any feelings for her, and Marek's character seems unlike the one described in the book. Another thing that's left out is a vital clue on the parchment, along with the professor's plea for help.<br />Many of the characters are changed. Doniger is much older than described in the book, and Kramer has been transformed into a man. The character of Francios is an invention for the film, and totally unneccessary. A couple of military-types are added to the group that is sent back. In fact, there should only have been 5 people sent back - Kate, Chris, Marek, the man who set off the grenade, and the one who was beheaded (which should have been a woman, as in the book). They also conveniently have 14th century people speaking modern English as opposed to Occitan, like the book has it.<br />There are so many things wrong with this movie, that it was hard to sit through. I only finished it because the friends I was watching it were eager to see it. It's as if someone cut-and-paste a dozen words from the book and told someone else to make a screenplay. This movie is horrible. The acting is lamentable.<br />If you are a fan of the book, I would skip the movie entirely.book and told someone else to make a screenplay. This movie is horrible.

0316666343|3.0|I found this novel a bit aggravating...the characters made me very angry. I had heard good reviews but once I read it myself I felt like I was lied to. I found that how she spent her time back on earth awful...this book leads you up to nothing...and what happens to the &quot;bad guy&quot; sucks...some of the plot was good and interesting but other than that it was just o.k...
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This was an interesting movie to see and it had its moments but for the most part it was a script and dialog starved visual experience.   The film itself was very well done but there just seemed as though there wasn't enough story there to do much with.  If you are a Bill Murray fan and liked his comedy movies such as &quot;Ground Hog Day&quot; then this movie will probably disappoint you. Bill Murray's character not only seemed unhappy about his circumstances in the film but you got the feeling that Bill Murray himself was truly not enthusiastic about his role in this movie. However, it does not seem as if it was really Bill Murray's fault since this movie script didn't provide very much for him to work with in the first place. <br />The actress Scarlett Johansson did a very good job in her part as the bored and unhappy wife of a photographer who is working in Japan at that time. It was difficult to take your eyes off of her during her performances and she was the brightest star in this movie. I also see a very promising future for the talented Sofia Coppola as a director. I do not believe that it had been her intent for Lost In Translation to become the &quot;big feature film&quot; that the media made it out to be. <br />Lost in Translation would have been a very good film to see as an independent type of short film or as a supplimental movie shown on HBO or any other pay cable channel but it did not really satisfy my expectations as a full length, major feature film for theaters or DVD.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Truly this is what I call a nice movie. It kept me in suspense from the first minute to the last. For some reasons I didn't want it to end. It had a couple of shadows from the famous Hitchcocks &quot;Psycho&quot; but that only made this movie better.<BR>Anyways, in one small area so many killings happen within a short time and in all of them John Cusack is somehow involved but at the same time he's the only one who is passionately trying to find a mysterious serial killer. But that's difficult. Not even you as the audience can not help him find the killer.<br />When I watched this movie for the first time - we were about 6 people in the dark room. We've all been silent and totally concentrated on the movie. We've all labeled individually a couple of great actors/actresses as potential killers. None of them turned up to be a killer in the end - a fact which left us astounded.<BR>So please Watch this movie - and see it for yourself who's this mysterious killer.<br />Highly Recommended
B00008ADPF|1.0|What a joke!!! Ifyou think this is talent there is something wrong with you, theres an mp3 going around that has their 2 hits split in seprate channels so you can listen to them both at the same time, and like the other review said thay are the exact same song. And then the stepford clone fans veto'd his review? if for some reason you like this band find the MP3's please, don't give them money, cause they put 0 effort in making it for you
B000002X0Z|5.0|oh my god this hast to be the greatest album of all time forget life after death and illmatic hell on earth is the s@#$! The beats and lyrics are incredibly dark and grimy, the only song on here that wasn`t was can`t get enough of it. god pt 3 is one of the most incredible death balleds ever and whats wrong with apostles warning? Overall i think this is greatest album of all time and extremely underrated though. I can`t believe not too many people dont agree with me.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I've always loved dream theater, for there progressive music thats always entertaining.  This album does not match up to anything previous in my opnion.  'As I Am' is the only song I really like on this album.  They have less prog. influence on this album, its just not the dream theater ive come to know.. A mediocore album.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I have both versions of Emma Kate Beckensale and Gwyneth Paltrow versions and I must say that Ms Paltrow completely ruined the story for me. Emma is supposed to be spoilt and used to her own way but not spiteful Ms Paltrow made her out to be prissy and stupid. Mr Knightly I liked in many ways but found that Mr Churchill was a prat when he should have been more of a man I would have not given him the time of day. Miss Smith was a simpering simpleton not a bit like the character in the book. I am sorry but I cannot recommend this dvd to anyone
0743454529|4.0|I have read most of Picoult's novels and mostly enjoyed them. The premise of this one - harvesting the various tissues and bodily fluids of one child for another - was irrestistible. I think she did a very good job with a difficult story, told by many different characters in different voices and viewpoints. However, the ending seemed contrived to me, so I could not rate the book 5 stars.  And as other reviewers have said, have those hankies handy!  I like her style, though, and I think it is a difficult thing to pull off a novel like this, so I do recommend this book highly.  VERY hard to put down!  Well worth your time, as are many of her other books.
B00005JMEW|2.0|This movie was dumb.  Some cool stuff, but not worth the hype.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|My first album was Britney's Spear's ...Baby One More Time. Then, i thought that she was an okay singer, she showcased her voice a little without having all these overproduced and overrated technology that overshadows her voice now, and she was more simple and less desperate in trying to make a statement about her image, which we all now that it was all about her sex appeal and her looks in the beginning. Nowadays, there is really not much to say about Britney. She's always trying to make a statement that she's \\"mature\\" and \\"growing up\\" just because her tracks are less \\"bubblegum\\" and a little more \\"edgy\\", which in my opinion just makes her look the opposite of what she's trying to say. Her publicity antics alone not only say that she's irresponsible and less of a mature person already by trying to make excuses and shy away from the media's questions, but her music, like her image and attitude, is not really changing. \\"IN THE ZONE\\" is not in DEPTH, ORIGINAL, yet alone something that britney HASN'T DONE, whether it is on an album or on a stage performance. It's STILL the same material, it's just more produced and has a little more sex in it. The lyrics are all pretty much the same, there's no variety at all. It's still the same material, no depth, no meaning, nothing to the imagination, no point. Her album lacks substance, and her vocal ability just lacks talent and depth as well. All this girl is about is just showing more sex through every performance to back up her lipsyncing and boring dancing that anybody can do if taught. Even though it gets  our attention, it just gets old and less \\"shocking\\" and \\"edgy\\". She needs to learn that there is more to being \\"mature\\" in the music industry than just taking off your clothes and replacing singing with grunting, moaning, and whispering, and just being a boring tease, and that there's more to growing into a woman than just being comfortable with her sexuality(don't get me wrong, being comfortable and empowered with sexuality is GREAT, it's something that every woman AND man should achieve, but it shouldn't be the only goal, there's more to life and maturity than just sex). But pretty much that's what we all expect from this kind of pop music. Pop music doesn't have a reputation for being original, or trying to show that there is a great singer behind the bubblegum, cheezy lyrics (i think Madonna is the only acception, not the best singer, but she had something to say and her statements about sexuality, love, and religion that had changed woman's views on themselves and their sexuality). If \\"teeny boppers\\" or 80 year old men enjoy watching her body and just being more slutty and showing a lack of talent and musical grace, and dont mind that she lipsyncs and doesnt show any effort at all to sing her very simple lyrics that dont take that much effort to sing, then there's not that much to say or do. Britney will be around as long as people are still \\"shocked\\" by her more daring but less original sexual antics and performances, and think that her music will be anymore interesting as the next.
140003180X|5.0|The Detective Agency is in a bind.  Income from clients isn't matching costs of operations.  Even the merging of facilities by moving the Agency to the site of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and elevating Mma Grace Makutsi to Assistant Manager [along with her already being Assistant Detective] hasn't increased the cash flow.  Now, in the midst of business and personal crises, a new detective agency is established in Gaborone.  It's run, of course, by  [shudder!] a man!  And what a man!  Cephas Buthelezi is a name commanding respect.  Whether this man is an inheritor of Zulu traditional power and deserves deference remains to be seen.  Will he corral all of the Ladies' Detective Agency's potential clients?<br />Compounding the business stress are the personal issues.  Precious Ramotswe, founder of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has become a foster parent of two orphans.  The girl, confined to a wheelchair, has been subjected to schoolmate taunting.  Her brother has developed new and disturbing behaviour, typified by the killing of a hoopoe bird, unheard of in Botswana.  Beyond the children's problems is the ongoing, but not fulfilled, engagement of Precious and Mr J.L.B. Matekone.  Will they ever wed?<br />More to the point of this tale is Mma Makutsi's spinsterhood.  As the highest scoring graduate of her typing school, McCall Smith makes her more intellectual than desirable.  Yet these very attributes should make her a prime catch for men following Botswanan tradition.  And in Mma Makutsi the author shows how these traditions should be respected.  Although her &quot;typing school for men&quot; [using ten used typewriters] is created to help the issue of cash flow, is there a more subliminal motive?  As it happens, much of the story pivots on this question.<br />There is, as there must be, a &quot;case&quot; to be solved.  As with all McCall Smith's tales of Mma Ramotswe's business, it departs from any typical mystery novel.  A hesitant man calls on her services with a special requirement.  There was a crime, perhaps two, but it was long ago.  The victims may not be alive or perhaps far away.  Precious is charged with finding them for a unique resolution to long distant events.  As always, she rises to challenge with common sense, a bit of personality manipulation, and effective negotiation.  As always, she does it all with tact, forbearance and skill, leaving none hurt or regretful.<br />McCall Smith's narrative skills in weaving events and characters have few peers.  Although it's doubtful Precious Ramotswe is a &quot;typical&quot; Botswanan, she's a character worth emulating.  The author follows the modern pattern of making men either arrogant or weak, but that, unfortunately, drives sales these days.  Perhaps when Mr J.L.B. Matekone emerges from his doldrums, McCall Smith will be able to restore some balance.  One hopes it doesn't take too many books to achieve that.

B00009RAJI|5.0|Just a quick note to clear up some confusion in regards to &quot;Gold Dust Woman.&quot;<BR>The version included here on Disc 1 (with the faded intro and outro) is the one which was originally included on 'Rumours' when it was released on vinyl in 1977.<br />When 'Rumours' was released on CD in the late-'80s, an alternate version of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; was used on the second-pressing, and that version is the one which didn't fade-in and had a cold-stop ending. That mix also included the sound of glass shattering during the coda... which was not used on the original vinyl mix.
6304696515|5.0|From an earlier review...<br />&quot;Great Potential Ruined By Mediocre Actors&quot;<br />Oh, now THIS is rich...<br />THREE Oscar-nominated performances, and one of those is an example of &quot;mediocre&quot; acting?  Gimme a break.<br />This is without doubt a fine film...  Wicked, delightful, and delicious even for this guy's guy (forget that &quot;chick flick&quot; nonsense, any man who doesn't wish to take Malkovich's place in &quot;educating&quot; a very young Ms. Thurman is delusional).  Five stars, a modern classic.<br />Superb cinematography, acting, costumes, dialogue, etc.  Highly recommended.
B00005221L|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger kept taking on one challenger after another as the 80s progressed, needing to pick an even more difficult foe each time.  In &quot;Predator&quot; Arnie found one of his most difficult foes ever, perhaps his single most difficult until facing Satan in &quot;End of Days,&quot; but that is another story altogether.<br />Arnold is leading an elite group of commandos through a South American jungle in a search for kidnapped officials.  It turns out that finding the terrorists that supposedly kidnapped the officials was the easy part.  Getting back out of the jungle turns out to be a nightmare.  The commandos soon discover that the jungle covers a hunter with nearly supernatural abilities, courtesy of a cool high tech suit that renders the hunter nearly invisible.  This very same hunter has agility and strength that even Arnold would envy, and who is physically more than a match for Arnold.  But this movie is not just about Arnold's strength; this time Arnold shows that he is an intelligent hunter, and uses the alien's few weaknesses against him to ultimately get the best of him.<br />This movie does have a few plausibility weaknesses, but you are so busy with the nearly non-stop action and the coolest alien since &quot;Alien&quot; that you have little time to consider the implausibilities until after the movie is over, and by then who cares?  While this movie may not be one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies, it still plays well as an action movie, and provides Arnold with one of his most challenging foes ever.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Wow.<br />How stupid of me to like &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;.  As the prior reviewer noted, Dire Straits is in the same mediocre company as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, etc.<br />I would argue until I am blue in the face that this album (and this band) has practically nothing in common with those other bands, but how can I argue such logic?  One only wonders what this top o' the line music reviewer considers to be GOOD music, since Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd are such unlistenable drivel...  Go figger.<br />In any case, to answer the grade-school drivel of another &quot;reviewer&quot;, I can easily name other albums/cd's that Dire Straits is known for.  How about &quot;Making Movies&quot; or their self-titled debut, with the classic &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;?  Or are those albums crud, too?  Guess so.<br />Brothers in Arms was the defining moment of the early CD era (along with Peter Gabriel's &quot;Security&quot;).  Full-digital recording, clear and well-recorded.  This was the first CD to sell over a million copies, and with good reason.  This was the &quot;test disc&quot; in the mid-80's that best showed off the new digital format, and anyone who had made the switch to CD's in that day was seriously lacking if they didn't have this CD in their collection.<br />To pooh-pooh this CD is to ignore its' place in history, damn it for its' commercial success (why oh why was it so popular! it must have sucked!), and conveniently ignore its' impact.<br />Oh, for shame, silly ones...  You know not what you do!
B00003CXCT|1.0|i can't believe George Lucas is only releasing the \\"Special Edition\\" versions of these movies.  He completely destroyed everything about these movies that were so great.  Those out-dated effects still work today and the puppets look better than CGI effects made these movies spectacular!   The fact that George wont release the original, and TRUE versions of the movies proves that he isn't an artist to respect, but more of a business man, with no respect for any of his fans or anybody that helped him put those original masterpieces together.  I will not buy this set, I'll wait for the original movies which will no doubt be released a few years from now so Lucas can milk even more money from those who buy this one.
B000002NJS|5.0|&quot;Ray Of Light&quot; it's the best album of all times in my opinion, I just love it and don't get tired of it. The tracks are wonderful, Madonna re-invented her wonderfully this time. A must-have CD.<br />1 - Drowned World (9/10) : Wonderful!!!! Still it's one of my least favourite tracks in the album. The calm rhythm, the video... everything works here.<br />2 - Swim (9/10) : Amazing song! Has great rhythm, wonderful lyrics.<br />3 - Ray Of Light (10/10) : Second single, best video ever! This song has wonderful lyrics, wonderful rhythm. Everytime I listen to it I feel happier...<br />4 - Candy Perfume Girl (8/10) : My least favourite track in the album, doesn't look a lot like other songs. Still is a great music.<br />5 - Skin (10/10) : Starts slowly, ends quickly. The rhythm here it's the best of all! Lyrics are great too.<br />6 - Nothing Really Matters (10/10) : One of my favourites, has amazing lyrics and an addicting rhythm. Makes me wanna dance everytime I listen to it.<br />7 - Sky Fits Heaven (9/10) : The best thing here are the lyrics. They're out of this world!<br />8 - Shanti/Ashtangi (8/10) : I used to skip this song, nowadays I listen to it very carefully. Has a weird, cativating rhythm.<br />9 - Frozen (10/10) : Lead single, one of the best songs ever made! I don't have words to describe this masterpiece...<br />10 - The Power Of Goodbye (10/10) : You think &quot;Frozen&quot; can't get better, but when you listen to &quot;Power Of Goodbye&quot; you change your mind. Although it looks a lot like the last song, it's wonderful, amazing!!! The best song ever in my opinion! I listen to it 10 times in a row and don't get tired of it.<br />11 - To Have And Not To Hold (10/10) : Another wonderful song, with great lyrics. I found myself singing it in the street a few times.<br />12 - Little Star (9/10) : Has a revigorating rhythm, and great lyrics. Madonna actually wrote it to her first daughter, Lourdes.<br />13 - Mer Girl (8/10) : Seems boring, but whenyou listen to it carefully, you start liking it a lot. It tells a story about Madonna's childhood. Great to close the album, very misterious and dark song.
6305537321|2.0|I am very much getting into classic movies the last few years and (as stupid as it sounds) hearing moon river on sex and the city and knowing it was connected to this movie made me want to see it.  I agree with the observation that audrey hepburn is very classic and elegant but I found the movie to be extremely boring!!!!  In fact the only part I did enjoy was the music.  Perhaps I went into it with too high of expectations since it is such a revered movie, but good acting or not, it was very slow paced and I fail to see why this was such a hot movie.
B000089RVR|5.0|Yes, this is a real masterpiece! That's probably why stayed a few weeks on top of English charts. Dido is successful again in creating wonderful ballads and catchy songs. If you thought she would never be able to do something like &quot;No Angel&quot;, her debut album, you were wrong. This is even better!<br />1 - White Flag (10/10) : This song is one of the best of the new century, and a real amazing track. It opens the album very well. I like WF a lot because I must have listened to it about 300 hundred times and still didn't get sick of it!!<br />2 - Stoned (10/10) : I love this track, even though the fact it takes about a minute for Dido start to sing. Her voice is wonderful and the rhythm is perfect!<br />3 - Life For Rent (9/10) : I like this song a lot, Dido shows her talent for writing lyrics here. The rhythm is &quot;happier&quot; here, not as dark as in &quot;Stoned&quot;. A great song indeed.<br />4 - Mary's In India (7/10) : I had to listen to it a lot of times for me starting to like it actually. It's a calm acoustic song. What I like most about it are the lyrics.<br />5 - See You When You're 40 (10/10) : Although it's very calm and a little depressive, this song is so powerful that I got addicted to it for a long time. Wonderful lyrics, wonderful voice, wonderful background.<br />6 - Don't Leave Home (11/10) : Yes, that's a masterpiece!! This song is the best track of the album, and one of Dido's best works ever. Everything works here... I'm happy it was released as 3rd single.<br />7 - Who Makes You Feel (7/10) : I think it's the track I like less, still it has a great chorus. Dido's voice sounds wonderful here too.<br />8 - Sand In My Shoes (9/10) : I like this song a lot, although it's very similar to others.<br />9 - Do You Have A Little Time (9/10) : Wonderful track!! Works very good with the rest of the album :)<br />10 - This Land Is Mine (9/10) : I like this a lot too, it get's better once you here it a few times!!<br />11 - See The Sun (10/10): Well, this is a great song! Closes the album very well. Makes me wanna listen to it all over again...
B0000AXE8I|4.0|the first matrix grabbed the viewers attention because of its first introduction to its great special effects that dazzled the eyes of those who saw it and its intriging explanation of what the matrix was. So the second one didnt have much too talk about except the background info that nobody cared about because the first one gave us all the interesting stuff. The action scenes were good but they lasted too long to keep the watchers interested. The movie became more of an anoyance that kepted dragging on about alot of talk that made viewers exhausted and bored because of the things said that nobody really cared about. But the special effects were great and the movie overall, wasnt that bad.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence it's sort of a new type a song. A mix of new metal with gothic music and pop, but much better. Every track here is good, although there are a few depressing ones, without almost no instruments:<br />1 - Going Under (9/10) : I like this song a lot, although it was overplayed here in Brazil. I think made 3 times more success than &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;...<br />2 - Bring Me To Life (10/10) : I'm kinda of tired of it now, but still it's a masterpiece! Wonderful lyrics and beats. The rap in the middle isn't very good though, but works very well here.<br />3 - Everybody's Fool (10/10) : One of my favourites tracks in the album, 4th single of the album. I really love it, one of the best rock songs of 2004 already.<br />4 - My Immortal (9/10) : Very calm, dark, misterious and depressing song. Still, wonderful! I must say I never loved a calm song this much.<br />5 - Haunted (9/10) : Another masterpiece, this song is very dark and full of eletronic effects. Great indeed, although you may get sick of it after a few weeks :P<br />6 - Tourniquet (10/10) : My favourite!!! Amazing song, the chorus it's the best thing ever. I think I listened to it 60 times in a row, and still like it a lot.<br />7 - Imaginary (10/10): Calmer song, with wonderful lyrics. Amy's voice here songs divine. One of the best things in &quot;Fallen&quot;.<br />8 - Taking Over Me (10/10) : This song sound more like a rock song, and that makes it wonderful. If you were a little bored with calm ones, this will cheer you up.<br />9 - Hello (8/10) : One of the calmest songs in here, what makes it a little boring. Anyway, pay attention to the lyrics, they're awesome.<br />10 - My Last Breath (10/10) : Everybody I talked to love this song, probably because it's perfect in rhythm, instruments, lyrics... finally a noisy song!!<br />11 - Whisper (9/10) : Besides of the name of the song, this song is not calm. It's actually a little noisier than many others. Anyway, it's not as good as other tracks,still a good choice to close the perfect album.
B0001EFTVA|3.0|Satoshi Kon's third movie is about a homeless bum, transvestite and runaway finding an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve as they attempt to search for the baby's parents (in order to give them a piece of their mind).  As the other reviews say, it's a really uplifting story about the spirit of Christmas, forgiveness, and destiny.<br />Unlike Kon's other two movies (PERFECT BLUE, MILLENNIUM ACTRESS) , this one is primarily a comedy and has a lot of funny moments and will get you shedding a tear or two.  I didn't think this movie was as strong as his other two, but it's definitely a tearjerker if you watch it during the Holiday Season.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I simply fell in love with this record. Although it's not as good as &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;American Life&quot; it's a whole different album and has wonderful tracks:<br />1 - American Life (7/10) : It's probably the weakest track in the album. Madonna released it just to express her feelings. Anyway, it's still a good song.<br />2 - Hollywood (9/10) : Well, I love it! It didn't chart very well in the US but became a hit everywhere else in the world.<br />3 - I'm So Stupid (8/10) : It's a great song, although has nothing in special. It's one of the most eletronic tracks in the album.<br />4 - Love Profusion (9/10) : I love it too, it's a calmer song than the first 3 tracks.<br />5 - Nobody Knows Me (10/10) : Wonderful song, one of the best in here! Very eletronic and addicting.<br />6 - Nothing Fails (10/10) : It's amazing, reminds me of &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;. It's a mix of eletronic with gospel acoustic music.<br />7 - Intervention (7/10) : I think I never payed a lot of attention to it. I often forget it, although it's still a great song.<br />8 - X-Static Process (10/10) : One of my favourites. I don't know what made me like it, it's a very simple acoustic song.<br />9 - Mother And Father (10/10) : My favourite track in the album. Eletronic song, kinda of funny. Has amazing lyrics.<br />10 - Die Another Day (7/10) : I used to love this song, but I think I overplayed it. Has nothing to do with the rest of the album, but still is a great one.<br />11 - Easy Ride (9/10) : Great choice to close the album. It's a very dark, peaceful and calm song. Amazing lyrics too.
B000001EHS|4.0|Any greatest hits album is intended for the casual listener or someone who is thinking of \\"getting into\\" the band.  It is not aimed at die-hard fans.

B00004X01U|5.0|Yes, Madonna did it again! But this time, instead of impressing the world with the spiritual &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, she decided to invest in eletronic song. The result of &quot;Music&quot;, one of the best albuns of the year and one of the best of her career too. The tracks are simply amazing and addiciting:<br />1 - Music (10/10) : Well, 99.9% of the world has heard this song. It's wonderful, amazing, unique. That's probably why hit #1 everywhere in the world.<br />2 - Impressive Instant (10/10) : Wonderful track, plays a lot with eletronic music. Madonna's voice sounds different here, but still great.<br />3 - Runaway Lover (8/10) : It's a little lost between great tracks like &quot;Impressive...&quot; and &quot;I Deserve It&quot;. Anyway, it's a very fast great song. Will make you feel in a rocket.<br />4 - I Deserve It (10/10) : I love this one, it's a calmer song, but still eletronic. Has wonderful lyrics and chorus.<br />5 - Amazing (9/10) : At first I fell in love with it, but I guess I overplayed it. It's wonderful, with a very &quot;young&quot; lyrics.<br />6 - Nobody's Perfect (9/10) : Also a great song, with addiciting rhythm!!<br />7 - Don't Tell Me (10/10) : Great choice for 2nd single, became an amazing hit everywhere. No words for this masterpiece!<br />8 - What It Feels Like For A Girl (10/10) : I love this song a lot, there's a part where Madonna talks in the beginning that's just wonderful! Anyway, I think the remixes are better than the original song.<br />9 - Paradise (Not For Me) (9/10) : It's a long ballad, full of different rhythms. Here Madonna sings in french for a while. Great song too.<br />10 - Gone (10/10) : Closes the album very well, anyway didn't get many attention by fans. I simply think it's the best song in the whole album.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Awesome revenge film!!!  I wasn't expecting to like this movie when I was forced to go the watch by a friend at the theaters.  Throughout the movie, I was surprised the rare artistic expressions of the story line. I saw Kill Bill Volume 2 today, and I can't wait for the DVD release. It's a must see movie!!!
B00006HBUB|1.0|I hate it when people make cartoons into movies which have actual people casting. It's just not as good as the cartoon. The one thing I hate the most about this movie is the crappy animation with Scooby Doo. His face doesn't look anything to a real dog's face, it looks like it was poorly animated. It's not like it's impossible to make a dog look normal when it opens it's mouth. If you watch Homeward Bound, you'll notice the animation of the animals' mouths looks good. I also think everything else in this movie is inane and stupid.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Something's Gotta Give is a romantic comedy that can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. Columbia Pictures presents an all-star cast in this 128 minute feature. Writer/Director Nancy Meyers, who wrote &quot;What Women Want&quot;, puts a new twist on a mid-life crisis.  Harry, played by Jack Nicholson, a 63 year old get-around who has never dated women under the age of 30, doesn't experience his crisis until he meets Erica Barry (Diane Keaton).  As a beautiful, intelligent, successful play-write Keaton is the mother of Harry's latest fling.  After a heart-attack in Keaton's home, he finds himself at her mercy physically and then emotionally.  Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) who is Nicholson's doctor falls for Keaton and overlooks the age difference to see the beautiful person that she is.  Meanwhile, Harry realizes that he's about to lose the love of his life.  When a movie lets the viewer laugh and cry it deserves five stars.  Something's Gotta Give will do that for you. This is a must-see movie that explores the changes that result from divorce and heartbreak and how they can be overcome.  Watch it with an open mind!
B000009EAD|1.0|When I litened to clips of this album and read reviews here on Amazon I thought Iced Earth might be my next favorite band. I finally bought the cd. There seems to be a pattern of tracks The 1st song is heavy the next is a ballad, heavy, ballad, heavy ballad, and so on for the rest of the album. At first I liked some of the songs but then they quickly got old due to the simple song structures. Every song is the same verse, chorus, verse, chorus. Then I got sick of it and never listened to it again. This cd sucks! Sure it's true heavy metal and they have a good vocalist but if you want good power metal listen to Blind Guardian.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead secured themselves as a permanent member of popular, yet very original Rock Band when they released this album.  This album has a unique feel to it, and its nearly impossible not to enjoy all of the songs.
0064407667|1.0|When i heard my entire grade ranting about how fabulously amazing it was, i decided to read it. it sucked. i was expecting a phenomoneal book full of emotion and sacrifice. instead, you might as well have made a list of bad things that could happen, and publish it in a best selling book. Snicket did what anyone else could have, think of bad things. over all, i would NEVER suggest this book to anyone else.
0140386335|4.0|I am still amazed at how many movies flashed by when I was a kid, that were books first.  20 years later I find this book, just by mere chance, and buy it.  I remember the movie, and loved it.<br />If you have seen the movie first, the initial shocker is that the entire movie is found within the first 1/4 of the book.  I couldn't believe it.  Things kept moving along, and as I flipped pages, you could easily tell there was MUCH more to come, yet everything that happened in the movie seemed to wrap up within the first 100 pages or so.  And I have to admit, the movie was pretty faithful to the book. I can see why some characters were changed, due to lack of good technology or time, but for the most part, everything is there.  The rest of the story is a fun read, and good fantasy.  I would recommend the book for those who were raised on the films, and for younger kids.  Not too young, there are some pretty creepy moments, but it nevertheless is a book about imagination.  It's money well spent.  Get it, if you want to see what really happend to Bastian, and Fantastica.
B00005NGAL|5.0|OMG this was incredible, i bought the video version early this year after spending ages trying to find it after seeing it on holiday one year-bits were in German but i got the gist of it. i havent been lucky enough to see it live yet but i will one day.  Elaine Paige is incredible as Grizabella, no one else can sing Memory like she does, in fact, before seeing Cats live, that was the only song from it i knew, i think it was sung to me when i was small.  I would recommend Cats to anyone who is new to musicals-thats how i got hooked and now have the soundtrack to Evita,even children can understand how one cat, Grizabella, is eventually taken back to the group, it shows an anti bullying message i think.  If you buy only one musical in your life, buy Cats, and the version with Elaine Paige and John Mills if you can because apart from the actors who play the Tugger and Mungojerrie and Rumpleteaser, they steal the show and Elaine in particular. The original 1981 West End cast soundtrack is also incredible, you can imagine Elaine and Paul Nicholas (The Rum Tum Tugger)commanding the stage with every scene they are in from the energy in the soundtrack.<BR>Memory brings a tear to my eye as do the final tracks when Grizabella is reborn, I have only one word for Cats, in any form and that is truly FANTASTIC, i only wish i could appear in it.
B00004T9UF|5.0|eminem is back to destroy all you sucka mcs. for those of you who hate on him cause his white y`all just jealos.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I love this musical, very nice and energetic. Full of comic humour and a satisfying love story
B000002AZ8|5.0|I've loved PJ since Ten came out, and Vitalogy is my 2nd favorite PJ album (No Code is 1st).  Vitalogy intrigued me immediately because it is darker than Ten and Vs., lyrically more cryptic, and many songs are more experimental.  It has some traditional pj sounds (Nothingman, Better Man), but the rest of the cd sounds a little more complex and sophisticated.  I admit I'm not a fan of Bugs or Mophandlemama, but those are just 2 songs.  There's a reason they play Corduroy at almost every show - it rocks!  If you only like straight-up rock, this may not be the album for you.  I recommend Vitalogy if you like rock, but also like The Cure and Interpol.
B00005JMEW|5.0|TO ANYONE READING THIS: <br />BUY THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B00000373U|5.0|Elliott Smith is my favorite artist because his music is so delicate, beautiful, sad, honest and real.  This album has some of my favorite Elliott songs (Between Bars and Angeles) which are sung in a fragile whisper, and the lyrics speak of the sadness, weakness and beauty of being human.  While I do recommend XO first to someone new to Elliott Smith, I would recommend Either/Or be in your music collection if you appreciate beautiful and sad music.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Formula for an excellent sci-fi movie: first the story, second the story, and third the effects. Effects are the spice, not the main course. Avoid the movie. Instead, eat a box of curry powder and you'll have experienced Matrix Rev.
1400049628|2.0|When I got this book, I was expecting something a bit more funny.  The premise is funny, a book on how to survive the coming zombie apocalypse, but the book seems a bit too serious.  <br />I did like the historical outbreaks section.  Each one of those could have been made into a pretty creepy short story.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Wow.  That's the only word I have to say about this album.  (...)  Every time I listen to this CD, at least one of the songs gets stuck in my head; maybe the lyrics, maybe a guitar riff, or sometimes even a bassline.  THAT'S how addicting Weezer is.  There is maybe one song on this album that isn't great.  Rivers and company have managed to make an album where every song sounds different but still manages to sound like it comes from the same band.  I look at music nowadays (where every nu metal band and song sounds the same and every pop punk band and song sounds the same) and long for 1994, the original release date for this album.<br />It reads in the liner notes that Rivers didn't expect the Blue album to sell 13,000 copies, which was all that Geffen shipped at first.  He was wrong.  It shows on this album.  From start to finish, every song is distinctive and catchy, while still talking about tings like being a geek.  \\"My Name is Jonas\\" has a fingerpicking intro then goes into some crunching guitar riffs.  \\"No One Else\\" is about his loudmouth girlfriend.  \\"The World Has Turned...\\" is maybe the weakest song on the album, but still gets stuck in my head.  \\"Buddy Holly (Happy Days video)\\" sounds like, well, a grungy Boddy Holly song and \\"Undone\\" is the best song on the album with catchy lyrics, great guitar work, and good video with dogs.  \\"Surf Wax America\\" sounds like the Beach Boys gone punk while \\"Say it ain't so\\" is a mix of reagge and some really hard rock.  \\"In the Garage\\" is a great tune about Dungeons and Dragons, KISS, and X-Men, and \\"Holiday\\" like a barbershop quartet meets Nirvana.  Every single song on this album is like that.  It gets stuck in your head and you are left wanting more.  And the deluxe ediotion gives it to you.  It kicks arse.
0679882820|5.0|I purchased this book for my two year old daughter at Christmas.  It has since become a favorite at our house.  We have fun making the noises toghether.  In fact, she can now repeat all of the noises and can even apply them to other pictures.  The rhythem of the book is easy and fun.  A great choice for parents.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The camera angles are amazing in the battle scenes.  Very few &quot;war&quot; movies are as realistic as this.  You really feel like you're there.  The acting is top notch and the cheesey lines are at a bare minimum.  Full Metal Jacket certainly has serious competition!  Buy it and you won't be disappointed!  For those with weak stomachs, the movie may be a little to graphic to get through at times.
1878424319|1.0|Mr Ruiz says---     \\"Take the example of Hitler: He sent out all those seeds of fear, and they grew very strong and beautifully achieved massive destruction. Seeing the awesome power of the word, we must understand what power comes out of our mouths. One fear or doubt planted in our mind can create an endless drama of events. One word is like a spell, and humans use the word like black magicians, thoughtlessly putting spells on each other.\\"     ..beautifully achieved massive destruction...???     This is in Mr. Ruiz's book!!    This is the only self-help book I've ever read that has  said that Hitler's destruction was \\"beautifully achieved\\" !!     You said only what you mean (according to your belief system).  I will now say only what I mean: Do not trust a self help book that says:     \\"Take the example of Hitler: He sent out all those seeds of fear, and they grew very strong and beautifully achieved massive destruction.\\"    I see no beauty in what Hitler did. Only the massive destruction of many millions of people.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I think this is the best Britney CD. I always liked her, always thought, even in her teenybooper days, that that style suited her, to me she's always sounded natural. So, In The Zone is a great record and shows that she's &quot;grown-up&quot;, in the songs where you see she's taking a step further, she goes very well, but the songs that take you back to the teenybopper days sound terribly boring and out of place, like trax 2 an 7. Another one I really dislike is &quot;Early Mornin'&quot;, despite the great melody, the lyrics really suck.. <BR>Besides that, the duet with Madonna is great and has lots of energy, and songs like Toxic, Brave New Girl, Everytime are just great. My fave is Breathe on Me, which has a great feel to it. <BR>I think Britney should start gettin recognition for this work. Even though she still kind of lacks style, I'm sure she'll find it on the next album, she's on the way to it.
B00005JL2O|5.0|God, this has to be one of the all-time funniest movies of all time. Mike Myers is a comedic genius and I was laughing through the whole thing. I especially loved the part when Britney Spears's head exploded. *Evil grin* Yesss...
B00004SCX6|5.0|I must say that Britney's second album is really good for only a 19 years old(back then).The first song(we all know it)is:Oops!..<BR>i did it again-written by Max Martin;this song it has a catchy chorus and such a great teen pop beat!Is to dance on it at parties,or maybe practise your moves on it,or just simple listen to it.The track is really powerfull,i mean is not any stupid song;Then is Stronger-teen pop smash hit.At first you can hear a rock guitar playin' on.Is a lil more agressive this track,but in the good way ofcourse!!I like it,in a way it can make you stronger.catchy and cool.Then there is Don't go knockin' on my door..i don't like that much this song,it's rather r'n'b pop. Let's just say it's not one of my fave song from this album.. I Can't Get No satisfaction-it's a remake after Rolling Stone,but though it is they kinda changed a little the beat,is more urban,modern and ...pop.Is a good song,at first it begings like a ballad,but then it turns out to be nothing more or nothing less than an ATOMIC pop song.I totally love it and never skip it.<BR>Then there is Don't let me be the last to know..the Shoo Bee Doo Bee Doo ballad.At first i didn't like it,i thought it was so boring,but right now i adore the chorus.Is more like a pseudo-country pop swing ballad.Is really nice.Is not such a happy song,but is cool!!(it was written by shania twein!).Then here goes one of my fave songs from this album:What U see is what u get.a 100% teen pop song!It's really awesome,it works for you if you like parties and songs like ...Baby One More Time and you Drive Me crazy!If Britney made a music video at it i'm sure it would turn out to be one of her biggest hits!It talks about a breakeup,kinda like you can't change me,i like the way i am etc etc-powerfull song,one of the best from the entire album!!I totally recomend it to you!Then there is Lucky.A pop happy fun song.Really catchy chorus,a song just like Britney used to chear us...i think it's really cute the song and worththe money!It's good for parties:everybody will just go on the dancefloor or sofa or whatever and just keep banging' there lol.:)Then there is One Kiss from you-a really decend happy pop song.It's kinda nice.It has a positive message and i think that's very good!!I would rate this song 4 stars out of 5.Then there is the ballad Where Are You Know-a really slow pop song,i don't like it that much and sometimes i skip it.It's for those times when you are said,and feelin' blue,it will make you feel better.Then the 10th track is my fave from the entire album!!I Can't MAKE YOU LOVE ME-a pop teen song,with strong message,is something between what U See is what U get and Oops!...I did it again!It's really catchy,one of the best songs from the album and you can realise that Britney is made to sing pop music!I adore this song.It's good for ocassions like:when you are alone and want to listen to something good!,at the parties!!when your have a crush on someboday and you just can't make that person love you..it's kinda said the message,but a really powerfull song!!It's the best<BR>by far!The seventh track is When your eyes say it-it's a really sweet pop ballad.It kinda works,it's a slow-romantic song.It's nice.The 12th track is Girl in The Mirror-it's a good ballad(one of my fav. ballads from my cd)it's pop with spanish guitar beat. It talkes about not knowing yourself sometimes.The last song is Dear diary,written by Britney,it begings with a dialogue between Britney and her diary.It's a teen pop ballad,it's not my fave songs,it's sweet though but it's a good song to end with such a great pop album!I totally recomnd it to you!!
B00005JMEW|4.0|Sunday, April 18, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Cinematically impressive homage piece.  Incredibly, Kill Bill v.1 goes beyond suspension of belief to allow us to consider Uma Thurman an anti-hero, death dealing instrument of carnage.  This hodgepodge homage to manga, anime, spaghetti westerns, and kung fu films works well and was great fun to watch on DVD and a bigscreen.  The action is framed marvelously, particularly the showdown with Oren.  Lucy Liu once again steals the show with her mouse that roars techniques, particularly her quick dash across a board table for some `face time' with a dissenter.  While not as supple and attractive as her appearance in Dangerous Liaisons, Uma comes off a lot better than the more recent Hysterical Blindness where we're asked to believe she's a barfly having trouble getting some action.  Uma plays the pregnant `Bride' who is shot and left for dead on her wedding alter by her ex-boss/lover and assassin squad co-workers.  After four years in a coma she awakes and seeks revenge against all five.  The violence is abundant and stylized, especially the arterial spurts from samurai sword cuts.  The tributes to old-school kung fu and noir films abound and it all looks marvelous if a bit staged.  Fans of the Lone Wolf and Cub manga will appreciate the final showdown with Lucy in a gently snowing park, the combatants run at each other as is the custom to make their final slices.  One must fall.  Pretty well all action and little exposition, this film sets the table for its more cerebral second part, hitting the theatres now.  Slick and deadly, with great production values, Kill Bill will enter the upper pantheon of action thrillers just as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction did before it.  Recommended.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I adore this album a lot because although i'm addicted to bubblegum pop Britney songs like ...Baby One More Time,Oops!.. did it again,Overprotected this album is a lot more mature and you can easily notece that!I would give In The Zone 10 stars if possible.If you are a Britney fan,i surelly sugest you buy this album,because you'll love it.I'm glad that Spears is kinda over of Sometimes,Crazy,Born to make you happy(although i love this songs!!)pop teen beat,it was time for a major change.This album is for everybody,yes including ADULTS!!It's not only for teenagers between 14 years old and 20,if you are 30 or 40 this album will make your life happier and healthier.I mean let's take for example the song Breathe on Me,it's more like Kylie's Slow hit but way better and cooler.It has a dance-pop beat and is to put you in a sexy mood.Also if you had a hard day at the end of the day i recomend you listen to this track(Breathe On Me)cuz it will make you feel better,it's for relaxation,but not only.You can easily dance on it.If you are a hip-hop lover this album will fit you too.In The Zone is more about urban r'n'b fun pop with some hip hop lines here and there!Touch of My Hand has an exclusive r'n'b urban pop folk beat,is something that you never heard before.It was written by Britney Spears herself.My fave song is The Hook Up,which combines fun danceble pop with some hip hop lyrics here and there.I adore this song,is fantastic!At the begining you hear a black dude singing,but only for a few seconds and another few seconds during the whole song, so no it's not a duet.The whole cd is such a fun pop album..you need to buy it fast!Then there is Outrageous,written by R.Kelly.Is a sexy song,because it has oriental-fun pop beat.It uses words like:\\"in my sexy jeans\\" or\\"My s!x drive\\". There is a part on this song where Britney sings:\\"I just wanna live in a place where love is free(..)\\"that the beat has nothing in common with the rest of the song's beat,a really happy part!!Of course after singing it,the beat comes back as it was at the begining. Just simply loving it!I have the european cd,so my in the zone cd includes The Answer-written by P.Diddy,love the song.Is more like r'n'b pop.Is a mature fun song..words just cannot describe it.Showdown is also a great song,pop-r'n'b beat with a catchy chorus.Everytime is a soft and sweet ballad,it will make your life better and if you feel said Everytime is the medicine for you.Highly recomend this song for you.Another catchy song is Toxic,more like a trance urban pop r'n'b song,you need to have this at a party if you want everybody to have fun and dance. Then of course there's me Against the music,the duet with Madonna-more like digital r'n'b urban pop song,with really catchy and awesome chorus.The remix of it is also really good and makes the songs sounds different:i would give the rmx five stars out of 5!I've got that boom boom is the closest song who has teen pop beat.It's a duet with the Ying Yang Twins,so it has some rap-hip hop lines here and there-really good song,because Britney's voice sounds sexier and more mature than her previous albums(i have all her cds!).In the end all the songs are awesome,i love them all.So i sugest you go and rush to buy this cd!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I heard this album for the first time while browsing at a little no-name CD shop, and asked the clerk what it was that he was playing.  The CD was actually bought for me as a gift a while later, and I have never been happier since.  This is my first Dream Theater album (I had never heard of them before) and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a taste for full-sounding, get-lost-in-it type stuff.  I am definitely happy with the entire album, though I will admit at first I listened only to certain songs (Tracks 1,3,6) but since then the rest of it has grown on to me so much that I listen to the whole thing straight.  In order to really appreciate it, it has to be listened through at least once or twice, especially since some songs are long and &quot;change&quot; somewhat throughout.  An incredible mix of tastes, styles, &quot;attitudes&quot; and skill.  A+ album!! (A Dream Theater fan has been bred in me by this album.. I have gone back and bought so many of their other albums)
0553801546|5.0|Not a perfect book but a great read.<BR>Will miss the Fool  and Fitz.<BR>The nine volumes are a great achievement from a great <BR>Author.<br />Wonder what the next series will be like.
B00005QIPH|5.0|With an old school and garage band sound to them, the Strokes created a perfect sound: rock that's simple and back to the basics, but is catchy and absolutely brilliant, all without trying too hard. When I first listened to Is This It, the whole time I kept expecting some sudden drumroll and then have the song fall into crazy guitars and drums, the way some bands start off a song plain and simple then turn it around into overdrive, but it never came with the Strokes, and that's the beauty of it: simplicity that you get absolutely hooked to. My personal favorites on here are The Modern Age, Last Nite, and Hard to Explain, but the disc as a whole is fabulous.
B00000255F|5.0|The lure of the open road on a pitch black night  tempts and intrigues us.  It's the romance of the highway, and the ghosts that call us out at night as we lay awake, beckoning, pleading, for us to leave the confines of our bedrooms to take a winding and lost drive.  The fascination with the unexplored resonates in all of Springsteen's records, from the stark and minimalist Nebraska  to the lush production of Darkness on the Edge of Town.  The album Born to Run is brimming with bombast and sorrow, celebrating the plight and fortune of man, with a defiance rarely heard.<br />Springsteen drops bombs on the sonic landscape with punishing guitars and dizzying climatic saxophone solos that trigger vivid images of Springsteen's downtrodden characters.  Mary in in Born to Run's opening track, &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; bursts with brilliant life, an enigmatic woman that leaves an indellible image in every twentysomething hopeless romantic.  She's introduced with a dancing piano piece and exits with a rousing arrangement of blistering saxophone work and crashing cymbals.  At the end of &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; Springsteen's voice exudes a genuine desperation and longing to escape with Mary, leaving us with sounds of engines roaring and the howling wind of the beach road he sings of.<br />&quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze Out&quot; rollicks joyfully and shakes our bodies in a myriad of blues infused guitar and boisterous trumpets that seem almost misplaced on such a &quot;pure&quot; rock and roll album.  However, Springsteen pulls it off perfectly, paying homage to the wild R&amp;B sounds of James Brown and jangle reminiscent of Chuck Berry.  &quot;Night&quot; rips open with fantastic melody of a jarring piano clashing with smooth saxophone work , a song that captures the joy and tribulation of the working class.  The characters run into the night, freeing themselves of any responsibility for a single and beautiful moment, only to return to the tiring routine of work the next day.<br />A heartbreaking and sobbing piano opens \\"Backstreets,\\" the tale of a tumoltuous and broken friendship over the course of a summer.  The listener knows what happens without trying to decipher the lyrics buried underneath Springsteen's unmistakable mumbling- the soaring guitar and suppressed organs instantly speak of Terry and her friend's fate.  It's a story that's been told plenty of times before, but never with so much grandeur and life - the song breathes, its heart beats, the cold blood flows through its veins.<br />The title track fittingly embodies the entire album. \\"Born to Run\\" is an anthem, and quite simply the purest rock and roll song of the last thirty years.  It celebrates escape and rebellion, and leaves us breathless as the blurred tailights of Harley Davidsons pass us by in a race, with hair dancing in the air and weathered leather jackets flapping.  It opens with a bright saxophone and drum beat, only to cascade into a triumphant vocal acclamation that stuns us.  When Springsteen tells you he's going to love Wendy with all the madness in his soul, you believe it.  Why?  Because you know Bruce believes it.<br />Springsteen sings of longing for a love in \\"She's The One\\" with an urgency startlingly unlike the defiancy found in the previous songs.  The \\"she\\" frustrates, tempts, and flusters Bruce, who is taken by her cunning smile and piercing eyes.  \\"Meeting Across the River\\" arrests us with its gloominess - a stripped tale of things to come between hustlers and friends.<br />The album closes with \\"Jungleland,\\" a rock opera of gang warfare, populated with some of Springsteen's most colorful and dynamic personalities.  Police chase after the fleeing, and gangs ravage the downtown Jungleland.  Many believe the song is referencing the racial riots that enveloped the town of Asbury in the 60s, others believe it's simply Springsteen at his lyrical peak.  Whatever the reasons, \\"Jungleland\\" is an epic closing to an epic album.br />A heartbreaking and sobbing piano opens \\"Backstreets,\\" the tale of a tumoltuous and broken friendship over the course of a summer.

B0000TAZTW|4.0|Great music with a loose feel. Some of the songs should have been hits, but that's the story of John's career. This is one Hiatt record to have if you are just owning one.
B00009KM7U|5.0|This CD is a collaboration of Artists from DNTEL and Death Cab For a Cutie... and together they created some of the best music this era has seen.  If you are a fan of the 80's, emo, or indie or you are open to any kind of good music, one sampling of the album will catapult you into an addiction of these masterfully engineered tracks.  The lyrics pull you into the broken heart of a man and the music will keep you coming back for more.  The tracks contained in this CD are better than 98% of anything that the Mainstream VJ's and DJ's currently expose you too. Don't pass up this marvelous work of art. Its simply amazing
B00005JMJ4|3.0|After watching this movie, I felt the confusion and perhaps frustration of visiting another 'world' where the main language is not English.  When I went to Montreal, Quebec I somewhat felt the way Bill Murray's character went through.  On the otherhand, since I had studied French from grade school to grade nine, I have to say that Ontario's education towards French sucks!  I could not speak nor understand much of what the French people were saying.  However, I were able to read French so I managed to find my way.<br />I'm not quite sure why a review said that it was \\"hilarious\\".  Is it because it's funny to see other people go through this turmoil of being lost and not speaking the native language?  I would feel embarrassed if I were to laugh at another person just because of language and cultural differences.  Hee hee Kinda reminds me of how my country, \\"Canada\\" was named... ^_^;;;  <br />Perhaps it was a cultural shock for most foreigners who have not visited Asian areas to find it so different?  Video arcades in asian malls and plazas in Toronto have many of the games of when Scarlett's character was wandering through in Japan.  I only wish we had a UFO Catcher that actually has the cute anime ufo plushies! XD  Karaoke is very popular in Japan and it's gaining popularity here in Toronto.  It's just expensive especially at Pacific Mall. T_T;  <br />I thought this movie was excellently protrayed as a third-person being lost in a completely different world.  The only downfall was that there was not very much of a story.  Bill and Scarlett would always meet and drink alcohol.  Personally I did not think drowning yourself in alcohol would be a good idea especially if you are in a different country where you do not know much of the laws.  You might get yourself into trouble but you may not remember much as you were drunk! =P  I guess that is the western's culture of drinking to loosen up and whatnot.<br />This was the first film I have seen by Sofia Coppola and thoughtshe did good in the directing but the story... there wasn't much there.  I think because of her family's connection in the entertainment business was why this movie got so much publicity compared to other Oscar nominated movies (excluding LOTR3 of course! =P).
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of visuals and sound, and in my opinion the finest of all Tarantino films. This striking tale of absolute revenge will not appeal to everyone, but it should. A smart, savvy script, great performances, unbelievable camera work, heart-pounding action scenes and a pulsating soundtrack puts this at the top of my must-see movie list. The DVD contains the wonderful DTS audio option and a fine &quot;making of&quot; featurette. Don't miss this one.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|A prime example of when you should not judge a book by its cover (not a pun).<br />If all of you out there decide to venture farther with this CD than looking at its cover, you will find one of the best cover albums ever.<br />You knew the songs had to be good- its Eric Clapton playing Robert Johnson- and they are. There's no two ways about it- when you take possibly the single best living guitarist and let him tribute to his biggest influence for an entire CD, you are going to get a good album. Really, like, wasn't that obvious?
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I loved the entire movie right until the end.  I was not happy with the end.  In case you have not seen it I won't give it away but remember my review once you have seen the end of the movie. I would have given the movie 5 starts except of course for the end.
0679428895|3.0|I enjoyed the novel Pompeii very much  but I wouldn't consider it a great book. Some parts of it dragged but, there were many interesting scenes.  I  was very interested in the Augusta Adequate and the dailey life of the Romans. There were a few surprizes. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy historical fiction. Someone in my book discussion group wants  us to read this but, I feel that although it's entertaining , there's not much to discuss.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|&quot;Scarface&quot; is, simply put, the ultimate gangster movie of all time and oddly enough it doesn't even involve the normal gangsters as they usually involve Italian Americans and such.  In the final analysis, &quot;Scarface&quot; delivers on all points from superior acting on a superior script to direction on an epic scale.  While this film was delivered to the theaters in 1983 it is one of those timeless films that still draws' an audience that includes people that weren't even born when it hit the theaters.<br />While Al Pacino will always be remembered for his performances in &quot;The Godfather&quot; films it is &quot;Scarface&quot; that first comes to mind when his name is mentioned!  To date, his performance in &quot;Scarface&quot; is and probably will always be his strongest and most memorable performance.<br />Just as &quot;Scarface&quot; is the film that took Al Pacino beyond super stardom it is also the film that brought two of Hollywood's most acclaimed and extravagantly beautiful women to the forefront in Michele Pfieffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio!  Both actresses' performances in this film are extremely strong and it is somewhat hard to think of the films they starred in down the road not having them had they not been fortunate enough to secure their respective roles in this film.<br />The one surprise of this film is Stephen Bauer whose career should've been launched into super stardom by his incredible performance in this film however, over the years he's rarely ever exceeded the character actor role.<br />What else could one expect of Director Brian De Palma other than an exceptional film as &quot;Scarface&quot; was one of those films that seemed to come together from a synergistic force from the very beginning through its script by Oliver Stone to its producer Martin Bregman to its director and its superior cast!<br />The Premise:<br />Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is one of many criminals that Fidel Castro has cast from his shores to Americato alleviate his prison system.  As Tony comes to the states he brings with him his voracious desire for money and power and not to mention, his ruthlessness as well.  When given the opportunity to use all of these talents to better his position within the Cuban mafia scene in Miami, he excels on all points.  Along with his insatiable need for power and money he has an overwhelming need to take care of his younger sister in Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) which could later lead to disaster...<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; is a film that tells the powerful tale of one mans insatiable need for power but also plays well to the fact that no matter how big a fish gets, there's always a bigger fish in the ocean...<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films in this genre.  Fair warning to those that are not fond of violence and harsh language as this film may not be for them.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Def Jam Presents:  Origins of a Hip-Hop Classic<BR>-Scarface:  The Rebirth<BR>-Scarface:  Acting<BR>-Scarface:  Creating<BR>-Scarface:  The TV Version<BR>-Deleted Scenes
0671027344|4.0|My ex boyfriend Andrew Flowers showed me this book before we dated. When I read it, I thought that it was really good. I was going to give him this book for his birthday until he cheated on me.  This book made me see where he comes from and even though he was a jerk, I still couldn't get over this piece of literature.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|See this opening credit.  Three big powers of Hollywood --  Miramax, Universal, and 20th Century Fox -- joined forces to produce \\"Master and Commander,\\" a thrilling adventure tale of HMS Surprise, led by Captain Jack Aubrey, set in 1805.  He is ordered to capture (or sink) the formidable emeny ship the Acheron, without any support from other ships.<br />The story, based on Patric O'Brien books, is simple.  Russell Crowe's Captain is determined to chase the Acheron, whatever it takes, and in the following two hours you see the fierce battles, and very brief, quiet time of peace.  Paul Bettany is doctor of the ship, and Captain's most trusted friend, and their friendship also plays the major part of the film.<br />But you want to know whether the battle scenes of the film deserve your time and money.  They do.  The authentic descriptions of the fighting on the sea in the 19th century, when good use of the wind and the cannonballs decided the winner, are presented with confidence and tact.  They are not bloody as the real ones perhaps, but the danger of being there is easily felt.<br />My complaint is the film's occasional lull (including the literal one), in which the onward action so far, suddenly without warning, changes to a different theme.  When you think a chase between the two ships is about to start, the scene switches to a big storm.  When you think the ship is heading south, nearing the icy continent, you find the ship had already changed its course, going north.  This quick change, with episodic mode, comes probably from the way of adaptation of the original books, which are too long to be put into film.<br />Russell Crowe (who put on weight for the role) is always good at playing this kind of character with machismo, and that's no surprise when he is so perfect, but more astonishing is Paul Bettany, who underwent the complete transformation from his past gangster No. 1 images to a thoroughly intelligent Dr. Maturin.  You recongnize in him no \\"MC Chaucer\\" he did \\"Knight's Tale,\\" and that is amazing.              <br />Peter Weir's direction is assured and well-paced, but to some the film's pace looks too slow at first.  He does not hurry to show the excitement of the battles or storm, and that shows his unshaken confidence in the material.  In fact, \\"Master and Commander\\" is a good case of \\"the images tell everything,\\" and to watch it is like seeing a majectic battleship gliding gracefully on the ocean.  And it's so beautiful.
B00005JM02|3.0|Once upon a time PIXXAR actually stood for something.  Creativity, innovation, imagination.  The fact that they are STILL using their bouncing anglepoise lamp in their title sequencxe is, perhaps, the ultimate proof of how those early signs of excellence have settled, instead, for easy profits and complacent repetition.<br />This is a typically &quot;cute&quot; Disney-style story, told in typically PIXXAR &quot;Toy Story&quot; manner by a team that have clearly decided to let the machines do all the work and have settled for second best.<BR>Unimaginative, routine, vacuous.<br />Probably great for kids, but certainly totally unworthy of all the hype.  <br />A few more films like this and in 5 years time no one will remember, or care, who PIXXAR were.<BR>What a sad waste of talent!<br />STRICTLY AVERAGE.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|The film certainly creates - in a convincing way - the atmosphere that would make it difficult for an uninspired foreigner on a short stay in Tokyo to be anything but bored.  Unfortunately the proliferation of simple sentences made up of simple words in the screenplay not only made it boring for this viewer but also failed to convince me that any meaningful relationship could develop between the young wife (Johansson) and the older actor (Murray). The screenplay was unable to lift the film above the level of the &quot;elevator&quot; music that anaesthetized the patrons of the hotel bar. I gave it 2 stars for atmosphere and the film work.  The non-plot and non-acting was worth a big fat zero. <br />This DVD is not worth owning or renting.
B00005JMSE|5.0|I never read the Hellboy comic books, I didn't know what's Hellboy about. All I had was a Hellboy promotional DVD given out at BestBuy. I don't have the same expectation as others Hellboy comic fans, but I seriously think this movie is actually quite good.<br />Besides the expected lots of actions, some positive humanity elements were injected into the movie, like the father-and-son's bonding between Hellboy & Prof. Bloom, the romantic storyline between Hellboy and Liz, as well as the trust & new friendship built upon between Hellboy and the FBI boss. I found the scene about Hellboy holding his father's dead body was quite sensational. Another scene that shows Hellboy checking out Liz walking with agent Myer was quite funny too. The story went very smooth and ended in a very romantic way. I didn't see a boring scene in this close to 2 hours film. I will definitely re-watch this movie once the DVD is out.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|Extremely boring, i felt like leaving the hall half-way through. I really don't understand what people liked about this movie, i dont understand why it was such a success. The acting was horrible, average special effects and the storyline was obviously a rip-off from blade. The action scenes were badly executed, and look extremely fake.<br />This movie basically tries very very hard to hide the fact that they copied nearly every aspect (including camera angles,costumes) from blade. And what's with the sound effects? The gun Kate Beck uses sounds like a toy gun. <br />There is nothing good about this movie, the main reason IMO ppl thought this movie rocked was because there was nothing else to watch when it came out. <br />So in conclusion, Bad movie with cool looking ppl in black to attract the juvenile crowd+ released at the right time = Success .
B00005JMEW|5.0|You may know the storyline well from other reviews. To cut it short, this DVD doesn't come with an extra second disc for special features nor deleted scenes. It simply includes the Kill Bill Vol.1 movie with subtitles option. A very short trailer of Kill Bill Vol.2 and a ten minutes feature of making Kill Bill. Period. I believe Tarantino may either save the extra goodies like deleted scenes, directory's comments, and interviews, etc. for the Kill Bill Vol.2, or may publish a special or extended edition of Kill Bill DVD Collector's Set.<br />I watched the movie in theater but I still bought this DVD to re-watch it more than once. Simply this is a very entertaining and well-crafted movie you would like to collect &amp; own it.
B0001I55OC|3.0|When it comes to movies about time travel the one that serves as a bench mark for me is &quot;Somewhere in Time,&quot; where on the one hand you have the absolutely stupid idea that you can travel to the past by thinking yourself there, but on the other there are some memorable moments, such as the beginning when the old lady tells Christopher Reeves &quot;Come back to me,&quot; and the point where he discovers that Jane Seymour is smiling at him when the photograph that captivates him was taken way back when.  The great lesson I learned was that since time travel is impossible you are going to have to jump ahead to the willing suspension of disbelief for any of it to work at all and that ultimately the value of the film is if it has anything interesting to do with the idea of time travel.<br />With &quot;Timeline,&quot; the 2003 film that director Richard Donner (&quot;Superman,&quot; &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;) made from Michael Crichton's novel, the suspension of disbelief is not that hard to manage.  Once upon a time there is a company that was trying to find a way to send three-dimensional faxes (i.e., a &quot;Star Trek&quot; transporter), and they discovered that they were sending packages to not just another time but another place, namely 14th century France.  We are told this is because there is a stable wormhole, at which point we nod our heads over that oxymoronic notion and look forward to what interesting things we get to do with this set up.<br />What we get is the siege of a castle, held by the English, by a French army.  What we do not get is a real reason why this has to be part of a time travel movie.  The reasoning in the film is that the archeolgoist (Billy Connolly), who has been digging up the site in the present, has become stuck in the past, and his son (Paul Walker) and colleagues (Frances O'Connor and Gerard Butler) are sent back to help find him.  However, my suspicious mind thinks that maybe what happened was that Crichton had a time travel novel that was not going anywhere and a story about the siege of a 14th century castle that had no real purpose, and he threw the two of them together, because the sad fact is that &quot;Timeline&quot; just does not get those two halves to fit together (there is a marvelous metaphor for this early in the film where one time traveler has made too many trips and his spine and other key body parts do not match up perfectly anymore).<br />My preference is for the castle siege part of the equation; a straightforward movie about a medieval siege would be pretty interested and Donner gets points for doing most of the fun stuff here without resorting to computerized effects.  But the assault keeps getting interrupted by the attempts of the time travelers to find each other and get themselves home.  Then there is the whole fear about changing the future, which seems rather moot because these people are so far beyond the butterfly effect stage that trying to get history back on track seems rather laughable.<br />Of course this gets tied up with a romantic plotline when one of the time travelers falls for a young woman he meets, only to discover she is the one whose death marks the turning point of the battle.  At that point you know he is going to be able to have his cake and eat it too, and the question becomes whether this film can come up with a really neat way of carrying it off.  The short answer is &quot;No,&quot; it does not, and for those who are fans of time travel films the obvious comparison is going to be to &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (What if the U.S. had a nuclear powered aircraft carrier at the attack on Pearl Harbor?).  But then I am still trying to figure out why Walker is playing Connolly's son and not Butler given their accents, but then I also trying to understand why the trailers think that Walker and not Butler is the &quot;hero&quot; in this story.  Then again, if you could show this film to an audience in 1557 I bet they would be really impressedby how this one came out.d by how this one came out.

B00005O5UK|5.0|For Jethro Tull's &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; album, Ian Anderson writes the lyrics, composes the music, sings the songs, does the arrangements, and then finds time to play the flute, acoustic guitar, violin, saxophone, trumpet and whatever else is lying around. On top of that, he creates Gerald &quot;Little Milton&quot; Bostock, the eight-year-old prodigy whose scandalous poem &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; was deemed unfit to receive first prize from The Society For Literary Achievement And Gestation (SLAG), and Julian Stone-Mason B.A., who reviews the Jethro Tull album &quot;Thick as a Brick.&quot;<br />All of this is chronicled in the four pages of the St. Cleve's Chronicle, all of which is faithfully reproduced for the little booklet that comes with this CD. The review by &quot;Stone-Mason&quot; concludes: &quot;One doubts at times the validity of what appears to be an expanding theme throughout the two continuous sides of this record but the result is at worst entertaining and at least aesthetically palatable.&quot; Who am I to argue? I enjoy the satirical articles in Anderson's faux newspaper (e.g., &quot;Non-Rabbit Missing&quot;) almost as much as I enjoy the music on the album.<br />Thematically &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; is similar to &quot;Aqualung.&quot; Again the writing is dense and enigmatic, but of course this is part of the fun. Anderson bemoans the social decay but he sees salvation down the road, but ultimately the lyrics take a back suit to the music and the brilliant arrogance of creating sections on the &quot;single track&quot; that are unique and yet clearly part of the whole. The thematic unity of the songs on &quot;Aqualung&quot; is now more than matched by a musical integration of various styles into a complete whole. You can recognize aspects of English folk music and classical bits in the mode of Handel, along with various types of jazz.<br />One of the nice results of this grand design is that for the first time Anderson's singing seems well suited to the music. By this point in the group's history Anderson had surrounded himself with the musicians who would finally allow him to explore his unique artistic vision. In the end just remember: &quot;your wise men don't know how it feels/to be thick as a brick.&quot; This is Jethro Tull's best album from start to finish, although certainly they come close to reclaiming the magic in &quot;Passion Play.&quot;ms well suited to the music.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I liked this film so much more than I thought I would. It clearly does not take itself too seriously; the trademark violence found in every Quentin Tarantino flick is present here also, but it's so over the top, it's cartoonish. Supposedly, gallons upon gallons of fake blood were used in the making of \\"Kill Bill\\", which was originally intended to be released as one complete, 3+ hour movie, but then it was split into two volumes so as not to make the moviegoer sit through a marathon, as in the case of the three \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" films. <br />Uma Thurman stars as \\"The Bride\\" (her real name is revealed in \\"Volume 2\\"), who is left for dead by her former boss Bill (David Carradine)and his \\"Deadly Viper Assassination Squad\\", aka \\"DiVAS\\", on what apparantly was to be her wedding day. It is not disclosed in \\"Volume 1\\" why she was targeted for death, but needless to say, after awakening from a four year coma, she is pretty bent on revenge. Thurman has developed into a solid actress, and she carries \\"Volume 1\\" through it's hour and forty-five minute running time. The other \\"DiVAS\\" are played by Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu(whose death at the hands of \\"The Bride\\" is rather spectacular), and Michael Madsen. <br />There aren't a great deal of extras on the DVD, although I did appreciate the inclusion of trailers from all of Tarantino's films, even the teaser for \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\". The DVD is worth buying, however, for the simple fact that Tarantino has created one-half of what could potentially be his best work. Yes, there will probably be a \\"Kill Bill\\" box set, which would merge the two films as a whole, as it was intended. Why wait, though? This is one of the best films of 2003, and a lot of people, including me, didn't go to the theater to see it. I won't make that mistake again for \\"Volume 2\\".
B0000D96NW|5.0|This is classic Machine Head - heavy and dark thrash metal!  This album could easily be the followup to 'The More Things Change' and it is very similar in sound, style, and attitude.  I am very happy that Machine Head decided to return to their roots after their last two disappointing albums. My favorite tracks are 'Imperium', which is classic Machine Head, and 'Elegy', which is a dark and brooding tune.<br />The album deserves 4 stars but I gave it 5 because I am so glad that Machine Head returned to their original sound and song-writing style.  Great album, pick it up right away!
0452283760|3.0|My dislike for the book is based on her message. It was well written and to-the-point. The dividing line between loving the book and not is far simpler, however. Capitalists love it; socialists do not. One-size-fits-all folks like it; the compassionate do not. Competitive enjoy it; the communal/cooperative do not. <br />And for many, particularly Americans, both Rand and the reader will often confuse socialism for communism. Vaguely 'speaking,' socialism is the Marxist-Lenin system between capitalism and communism. Whereas capitalism is primarily an economic construct and democracy a political one, socialism is somewhat of a mix. Each of these constructs can be mutually exclusive as Sweden is a social democracy.<br />Rand touts the virtues of capitalism, which it surely has. On the other hand, we can travel to countries like Sweden and The Netherlands and see a well-off culture with plenty of freedoms... and no homeless to be found. There's still a range of not-so-well-off and wealthy, but not billionaires in the face of the homeless. <br />If we allow ourselves to look at our fellow country folk as we do our family - us, perhaps we can have more compassion and understand that medical coverage for all, for example, is for the best for the society at large. Similarly, thanks to taxes, we share lots of common pleasantries like roads. <br />What American capitalists fail to realize is that pure capitalism doesn't work around the world the way it does for the U.S. For the U.S. to maintain its power and standard of living, we change the rules and subsidize our farmers when we compete with New Zealand. We impose tariffs on countries like New Zealand that can produce our same goods for a fraction. These actions admit capitalism's faults. <br />What's more, a successful capitalist democracy requires that value be invented upon. Value is based on demand instead of actual cost to produce. Not only is value based on demand, but also on availability - even if a good's availability if artificially controlled as are diamonds. Communism, on the other hand, while fraught with other issues, requires that value reflect the cost to produce. <br />As if this isn't enough, capitalism turns us into consumer addicts. How many times have we heard Bush suggest we go out and spend to support our economy? With an affluent European Union touting a larger population than the U.S., it's imperative that we out-spend them, so we're advertised to, over fed, and are encouraged to assume far larger sums of debt. Americans have become consuming robots and they're taught it will make them happy all for the sake of remaining the most powerful. <br />This is the kind of competition and beastliness capitalism breeds. We're not talking about the controlled society of the former Soviet Union. The controlled society was a victim of communism. <br />If socialists are at the mercy of government, capitalists are at the mercy of CEOs they didn't even elect. CEOs that when their businesses make large profits, do not have to pass it on, but can get together w/ the competition and keep prices where they like. Instead of passing profits on to the little people, the ones without medical coverage, for example, they can simply Ritz Carlton around the world and no one can remove them from power.  <br />Finally, what's moral isn't black and white. There is a world beyond our homes, surprisingly enough. Our realities are not universal. Our daily expectations aren't carbon copied around the world. Indeed, within the same day one can sacredly sacrifice an animal, fly north and be locked up for doing the same thing. <br />I disagree with Rand mostly because I see my fellow country folk as I do a family. If my sister is struggling, I help her with whatever it is I have to offer. I don't sit back, hoarding what I rightfully learned or amassed and preach that if I can do it, she can. I help and I expect the same in return when/if I should need it. That is a communal, collective, compassionate lifestyle where everyone wins because help extends far beyond money; time can even be 'socialized' in exchange for other commodities. It's much bigger than the dollar. <br />In the end, Rand simply has a bone to pick with her place of birth, the Soviet Union. Don't let her play on your indoctrinated fears of that which was associated with the U.S.S.R. Think for yourselves. <br />If you're a die-hard fiscal conservative, you can be a Rand fan and still consider yourself an intellect. If you believe the well-connected, affluent and most disciplined CEOs should lead you and not well-connected, affluent and most disciplines people of your choosing, Rand is for you.<br />My beef is with Rand's belief, not the presentation. We simply have differing beliefs and therefore differing arguments. Aside from that, the book is pretty well-written and held my interest. <br />When you understand each of Rand's characters represent ideologies, you'll realize it's as much propaganda as this review is.
B000005JA8|1.0|If someone with absolutely no musical ability, training, skill, inclination, or inspiration (and a like-[simple]-minded band) can make an album, then we all must be able to as well.

B00005JMUA|3.0|Kill Bill, Volume 2 carried on the two-part Quentin Tarantino homage to early Asian films decently, however it did not hold up to its predecessor.  There was less action, and the focus was more about the characters, which is usually not necessarily a bad thing, except for anticipated build-up to a climax that was never there.  In addition, I personally enjoyed the anime sequence in the first film and sadly felt that a similar animation would have made the second movie more enjoyable, but I do understand Quentin wants to give homage in different ways.  On another note, I feel that this film was more apt to grab the audience's emotions, although even this was weakly carried out.  Those of you who really enjoyed the first one will be let down, at least a bit.  However, as the homage that it was meant to be, I still say that it is overall not a bad movie.  Also, for the families, if you did not know it is definitely violent, with less displays of overt bloodshed that stood out in the first movie.
B00012QM9K|4.0|I think double sided discs are a great idea.  Prevents waste and is more portable.  I do agree that having the movie in two parts suck but for that I blame the public, not the movie company.  If people weren't so overhyped about DTS, there would be no useless DTS soundtrack on the disc, leaving enough space to fit a three hour movie in there.  Even George Lucas does not believe in DTS and for that, I applaud him.  Dolby Digital works for me, especially since it is backwards compatible and can be downmixed to normal stereo.<br />PS. My Canadian release had a security sticker stuck to the inside of the fold out case, beneath the disc tray.  They should make the trays so that it has an indent to accomodate the security sticker instead of ruining the packaging.

0743454529|5.0|&quot;When I was little, the great mystery to me wasn't how babies were made, but why.&quot; Unlike her friends and classmates, who were interested in the mechanics of baby making, &quot;I paid attention to different details. Like why some mothers only had one child, while others seemed to multiply before your eyes ... Now that I am thirteen, these distinctions are only more complicated [for me] ... I was born for a very specific purpose ... I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother's eggs and my father's sperm to create a specific combination of precious genetic material ... In my first memory, I am three years old and I am trying to kill my sister. As we got older [and I was told why I was 'created'], I didn't seem to exist except in relation to her. It made me wonder, though, what would have happened if Kate had been healthy.&quot;<br />So begins the story of a family. The kind of family we used to call &quot;nuclear&quot; until that became a dirty word. Sara, a stay-at-home mom, and Brian Fitzgerald, a firefighter, seemingly had it all. They had two children: a son, Jessie, and a younger daughter, Kate. They were stable, educated parents, active with their children and in the community. But in the real world, does this kind of happiness and accomplishment really have a chance to survive? That old cliché about &quot;a little rain must fall into each life&quot; hits this family like a tsunami.<br />When Kate is two she develops what looks like &quot;a line of small blue jewels&quot; down her spine, and her mother knows immediately that she is not seeing normal bruises. They go to the doctor, he takes blood, and everybody waits for the results; of course, they're not good. The family doctor wants the tests repeated in the hospital, in the hematology/oncology department. There, after a series of painful and invasive procedures, they learn that Kate suffers from &quot;APL ... a subgroup of myeloid leukemia. The rate of survival ... is twenty to thirty percent, if treatment starts immediately.&quot;<br />The treatments keep Kate alive for about five years until her body explodes with runaway cancer cells. She desperately needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. Sara Fitzgerald vows that she will do anything, absolutely anything, to keep Kate alive. And her determination leads her to conceive the idea of having another child, one who will be genetically engineered as a perfect match for whatever Kate needs to survive.<br />Approximately nine months later, Anna is born. When she asks, her mother is perfectly truthful and tries to reassure her of her special place in their family. Even as a very little girl Anna doesn't buy that line. She says, &quot;See unlike the rest of the free world, I didn't get here by accident. And if your parents have you for a specific reason, then that reason better exist. Because once it's gone, so are you.&quot; But Anna is a rebel, and while she unquestionably loves her sister with all of her heart, she begins to wonder if that means she has to go so far as to donate one of her kidneys to keep Kate alive. She has lived all of her thirteen years with questions like this that went unasked and unanswered. She resents never having been asked if she wanted to endure painful procedures and extended hospitalizations when she was healthy. Now, with the prospect of major surgery that will deprive her of a major organ, she decides that she must do something --- she hires a lawyer to help sue her parents so she can have medical control over her own body.<br />MY SISTER'S KEEPER by Jodi Picoult is the amazing, gut-wrenching, sad, funny, insightful, moving and thought-provoking story of this American family. This new novel is by far her best achievement and a leap forward in her literary oeuvre. Readers are asked to think about all of the technological wizardry in the world --- of the ways in which these technologies are used or, unfortunately, abused, and how the results of redirecting fate sometimes feels like the dizzying sensations experienced in threading one's way through the mirrors of a funhouse.<br />In a graceful portrait, masterfully written in high-pitched prose, Picoult raises the ethical, moral, constitutional, personal and mostly unanswerable questions about how anyone can make a life-or-death decision about a terminally ill loved one for whom extreme measures must be taken to play for more time. Where does the patient's right to stay alive infringe upon the life of someone else (in this case, a sister)?<br />One of Ms. Picoult's gifts is her sense of humor. Even in the face of the tragedy that befalls her characters in this highly emotional novel, she manages to imbue the book with lighter, delightful moments. No one can question the absolute love this family feels for one another; at the same time, however, they work at cross-purposes. Readers will smile, they will cry, they will be outraged and they will cheer ... what they won't be able to do is put the book down. It is definitely a cover-to-cover read.<br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum
078062369X|5.0|Wesley Snipes stars as the tortured soul Blade possessing powers greater than any man or creature of the night.  Blade sharpens his lethal skills under the guidance of a professional vampire hunter.  When the bloodthristy immprtals' lord Deacon Frost declars war on the human race, Blade is humanity's last hope for survival.  The best part was when Blade and Deacon fight.  I loved it when Blade chopped off Deacon's head and it grew right back.  I thought this movie was awesome.  It was packed with 100% action from its action-packed opening and pulse-pounding conclusion.  If you're a fan of vampire/action films this is the movie for you.  Enjoy!!!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Contains some spoilers.<br />I just finished watching this movie. I'd been wanting it ever since I read an article in Animerica about it, but I didn't think it was out yet, so when I saw it in a Borders Bookstore today, I snatched it up as fast I could.<br />And...woah, I can barely describe it. Normal anime takes flawless beauties with high squeeky voices and makes them a magical hero. This movie takes a transvestite &quot;uncle bag lady&quot;, a runaway teenage girl (who certainly doesn't look like almost every other teen you see in an anime), and an old pervy geezer who &quot;used to race bikes&quot;, and makes them into heros.<br />One day, in the middle of an argument, the three hear the screams of a baby, and decide to investigate. What follows is a long heartfelt journey as they try to find Kiyoko's (what they name the little girl) parents. Throughout the whole movie, you'll find places where you'll be both bawling and laughing hysterically at the same time (which earns you a few odd looks from family members).  At other points in the story, you'll be watching in wonder as the four of them (Hana [transvestite], Gin [old man], Miyuki [teenager], and Kiyoko) look like they really ARE a family.<br />Speaking of THAT--The characters are so true to life it's amazing. They all have their little quirks, their own personalites, their differences...It's AMAZING what Satoshi Kon and his fellows can do with a used plotline!<br />And as the last thing I can think of, for I must hurry and watch it again before my brain explodes-The music is so FITTING for this it's not even funny. You'd think the music would be depressing, but the sounds of something like hip-hop and dance music seems to fit the movie even better.<br />...Woah.
B00005JMSE|5.0|I loved this movie id go see it again. Ill be the first one to get it when it comes out on dvd it had some akward parts and the story line had holes in it but as they said this movie is not based on the first comic book. As far as the art work for the comic book which i recently went and read a bunch of the art work sucks. The hellboy in the movie looks a lot better.
B00004W221|5.0|I have seen critics dismissed this movie as highly predictable and manipulative. And they are probably right. But it doesn't mean it can't be a highly enjoyable film. You can't help feel happy for the guy when predictably he achieves his dream. <br />The film score by Jerry Goldsmith is simply outstanding too. And Sean Astin, as usual, is terrific as Rudy.
B000002VMD|5.0|Whitney really delivers on this album. I love it. She sings I will always love you. A true hit. She also sings Im Everey Woman a remake of Chaka Khans origianal song. And my favorite song she sings here. Run To You. Where she hits a High E over Middle C a difficult note to sing. I love this album.
B000002H97|5.0|Music is a funny animal.  You listen to a song, relate to it, then claim the bands as your own personal treasure. We all do it, it's why music is so outstanding to begin with.  Which explains why some braindead reviewers call this album a sellout.  Their beloved Metallica came of age, and broke down doors of casual listeners with these shredders.  I promise you, if you're into the crunch of The Thing That Should Not be, check out Don't Tread On Me.  This whole album, with the exception of the two killer slow tunes, Unforgiven being the better of the two, is like swallowing nails.  It hits you where it hurts.  Buy it, don't listen to the geeks who say its a sellout....their acne is affecting their hearing.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST METAL ALBUMS EVER!!!!!!!!!!
B000002NBY|5.0|I purchased this CD for the first time about five years ago.  It has been everywhere with me, being played over and over again.  Its finally been damaged beyond use, and I have to buy it again.  A great CD.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|The film was amazing - you either love or hate it; well I loved it!!! The action, the dialogues, the actors!!!! It's Pulp Fiction times 10 - Michael Madsen, in my opinion, steals the show.... In any case, the soundtrack is great; the movie is a must-see, and the soundrack is definitely a great buy. Highly recommend both!
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie is EXCELLENT! Titanic really shows the beauty and luxury of the Titanic, and how grand she really was. This is the most popular movie of all time (over 1 billion dollars)! I highly reccommend this movie, although almost everyone has alreadyy seen it. It is beatiful movie with great actors/actresses and will be treasured forever!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Like many, I found the first Matrix to be an exceptional movie, ground-breaking in every respect.  Unfortunately, it seems The Brothers were too successful too fast.  They needed a good, strong producer, not Silver the circus-barker, to tell them they had lost the brilliant balance they showed in The Matrix.  Instead, we are treated to the immature, self-indulgence of a pair of boys who know little of the world, but think they know a lot.<br />Reloaded and Revolutions were big disappointments, technically and artistically.  Of the two, Revolutions is the worst.  I was actually bored, even with all the eye candy and pixels being splattered.  All the lead actors, even much-maligned Keanu, do yeoman work with the weak script and are to be commended for it, Weaving &amp; Fishburne especially.  <br />This movie shows that tons of money can make great special effects, but not necessarily deliver a great film.  Even with all the special effects, it was so obviously a video game in both look and story line, that it was painfully predictable.  The special effects were so over top that it was obvious that they were pixels dying for our entertainment.  Militarily, the last battle is set-up so stupidly that by the end I was rooting for the machines, since the humans were taking such stupid and indefensable positions.  That battle would have benefited from a little knowledge of military strategy and tactics. <br />The storyline becomes so sophomoric as to be humorous.  The brothers seem determined to show how educated and culturally aware they are.  Instead they demostrate their shallowness with the cafeteria-style philosophy.  Cornell West shows why he is where he is, and fits in perfectly with The Brothers and these films...  Lot's of buzz words thrown around by a very good  grifter.<br />Rarely have sequals been so bad that they ruined the original movie so much that I wished they'd never been made, but that's Reloaded/Revolutions.  A mature, strong writer might have been able to take the script of these two movies and make one strong one.  Instead, The Brothers put themselves into competition with Peter Jackson and embarassed themselves.  <br />After LOTR, Master &amp; Commander, Gladiator, and We Were Soldiers, we know it's reasonable to expect a great story, great acting AND great effects in an action movie.  Reloaded/Revolutions might have cut it 10 years ago, but not now.  <br />If you've only seen the original Matrix, don't buy this DVD, don't rent it.  Same for Reloaded.  If you've seen Reloaded you may as well see this one, but it's like an autopsy.
B0000AR8NK|3.0|I definitely recommend this album, but if you're looking for &quot;Heathen Part II&quot;, you'll be disappointed.  It's not as complete or as overall satisfying an album as &quot;Heathen&quot;, which was a classic, in my opinion.<br />It feels funny writing that, because most of the album is chock full of songs that rank among his best.  In order of greatness: 1- Fall Dog...(hypnotic/very &quot;Luna&quot;-esque), 2- Never Get Old (fun, BIG), 3- New Killer Star (could be confused with a &quot;Blur&quot; song), 4- Try Some, Buy Some (gorgeous, synth-heavy remake of an unreleased Beatles song), 5- Bring Me the Disco King (One of the best written songs of his career) 6- Pablo Picasso (rocks), 7- Loneliest Guy (achingly beautiful).  As far as the rest of the album's songs:  1- She'll Drive the Big Car (so-so, could've been much better), 2- Title Track (dreadful beyond belief -- very &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;-ish), 3- Days (flacid), 4- Looking for Water (meandering, does nothing for me).<br />So 7 out of 11 songs are outstanding, and 4 out of 11 songs are misses.  That should rank as a 4 or 5-Star effort, shouldn't it?  Well, the very fact that I'm ranking every single song on the album is evidence of where it fails -- it just seems like a mish-mosh of songs rather than a cohesive whole.  In other words, after listening to &quot;Heathen&quot; from start to finish (and really, there's no other way to listen to it), I felt like I had been on a long, wonderful journey.  A journey that took me someplace that I hadn't thought of being.  &quot;Reality&quot; doesn't come close to doing that.  While a lot of the songs are great, &quot;Reality&quot; comes off as a catalogue album -- an album you go to to hear certain songs, rather than LISTENING to the whole thing.
630471193X|3.0|This retelling of &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; explores the possibility that, in a crazy society such as our own, someone might discover sanity/genius and thus become completely alienated. It does a great job of that; unfortunately, the story is paced incorrectly and thus has a long introduction, a crammed development and a schmaltzy, lengthy, sickening ending. Like most tales in which a character is suddenly a genius, such as &quot;Flowers For Algernon,&quot; there's a conflict between love for a woman and the alienation of someone feared by others for his ability. To his credit, John &quot;I was in Disco movies&quot; Travolta does a great job of portraying a man overwhelmed by his own intellect, looking every bit like someone who gets struck by revelation every few minutes. He's also every bit as childish and handsomely unintentionally aloof as a genius would be, and is enigmatic in that role; Kyra Sedgewick does a great job with her 1.5-dimensional character. This movie ultimately would do best if the rock/folk music interludes were cut and replaced with some silent scenes, and if the last 30 minutes were reduced from hanky-sopping drama to a few insights and then a slightly more ambiguous, less Christ-like ending. Overall however this is an exceptional movie for a broken society in a broken time.
0446310786|5.0|A true classic, this is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. A very moving and touching piece of work. I've never seen the movie, but I wish I did. I hear that the movie is counted as a classic, too. Only a truly invincible title can be excellent as a movie AND a novel.
B0000A0DXA|1.0|I thought I was watching a special feature when I started this movie, and was surprised that it was the feature. This is not a sequel, this is one of the worst DVDs of all time. Thankfully, I only rented it and am only out the rental cost.  Everybody, be warned, you barely see anything of the actual Boogeyman sequel, just scenes in fast motion.  There should be some kind of law because this DVD is slickly packaged and is a complete and total rip-off. Everybody involved with the making of this DVD should feel ashamed. Those who bought it deserve their money back.
0380002930|5.0|Don't be intimidated by the aspect of rabbits as main characters, this is a truly brilliant work by Richard Adams! I am very much interested in books involving animals... If you've enjoyed works such as: Poppy, Redwall, Wind in the Willows, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, Plague Dogs, and The Dark Portal, then I'm sure you'll love this. The rabbits take on an almost-human role as they fight to survive using their resources and wits after having to flee their home warren on an impulse by Fiver, a runt rabbit with a keen sixth sense. They are faced with many problems on their journey- fear, uncertainty, tricksy predators, and most of all, the desire to return to the safety of their home. A very moving and colorful tale, I recommend Watership Down to any animal or classic literature lover.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is by far one of the most plotless and boring movies I've ever seen. I was simply unable to find a point. After all the hype surrounding this &quot;movie,&quot; I was, needless to say, very disappointed. The fact that Sophia won an Oscar for this waste of film is really quite pathetic.
0064471837|5.0|I don't normally read too much fantasy/sci-fi books unless I'm familiar with a series or author. When I got Sabriel, though, I knew right away that it was one of those few sci-fi's that can actually keep me interested the whole way. The plot is very intriguing, and the characters can be both serious and hillarious at the same time. Somehow, Garth Nix has managed to create a magical, yet realistic world filled with suspence, romance, and action. It was this book that inspired me to become a fan of Nix, making him one of my favorite writers of all time.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Tarantino, admittedly, loves movies. It shows. As much as his films may be an &quot;homage&quot; to other films, he can take this and run with it, creating the most wonderful and original scenarios. I don't believe he's ever made a bad film, though everyone isn't ready for his quirky approach. &quot;Kill Bill, Vol. I&quot; is loaded with inspired tributes to loads of &quot;genre-cinema&quot;. Tributes to Sergio Leone, Brian de Palma, Anime and Kung-Fu films are obvious. Casting David Carradine was truly inspired. Also his use of color and editing are brilliant. The '70's references are fun and his culture-clash references are great. Uma Thurman is truly amazing, in a controlled, multi-layered performance that leaves the viewer breathless. Her energy is to be applauded. Can't wait to see &quot;Vol. II&quot;.
B000002JSH|5.0|When I remember the guitar oriented albums of the 1970's this one has to be at the top of the list. Paul Rodger's vocals are so soulful and Bluesy with the steady consitent rhythm section of Simon Kirke &amp; Boz Burrell while Mick Ralphs plays some the best guitar licks ever. No doubt one of the best for young guitarists who want to learn the taste and style of one the most underated guitarist alive.<br />Having lost guitarist Paul Kossoff to drugs in early 1974 Simon Kirke and Paul Rodgers joined with Mott The Hoople guitarist Ralphs and bassist<BR>Burrell to form one of the first supergroups. Their debut album is also a top 5 choice for many of us as well. This was the day of not a bad song on the whole album and these releases are a prime example. To this day &quot;Shooting Star&quot; gives me chills. Others like &quot;Deal With The Preacher&quot; and &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot; show why many of us in the recording industry would die to have Rodgers and Ralphs in our band. <br />I saw Rodgers' current band at the fabled Ryman Auditorium (Grand Ole' Opry) in Nashville during the Summer of 2003. He can still take your breath away with his vocals. <br />Of course I would be remiss not to mention that growing up Johnny Van Zant (JVZ / Lynyrd Skynyrd) considered Bad Company his favorite Hard Rock band next to Lynyrd Skynyrd. Not a bad endorsement.<br />At 53 going on 54 and a Hard Rock guitarist myself I recommend this album to any one who wants to hear what the guitar oriented Rock of the 1970's and 1980's were all about. Ralphs great guitar work in Mott The Hoople along side of the late Mick Ronson helped Ian Hunter &amp; David Bowie become famous. He followed it through into 3 incarnations of Bad Company through the 1990's. This album was principle in his career establishing himself forever as one the tastiest guitarist to ever be recorded.

Every song is awesome and if you're sorta dorky or in need of some cheering up, you have to own this cd.<BR>I own about 15 cds, and 6 of them are Weezer. So trust a Weezer fan to tell you that this cd totally rocks.

B000002UAO|5.0|While just about any Beatles album would probably be rated at least 5 stars, Rubber Soul is deserving of about 10 stars if it were possible.   The songs range from great (Drive My Car, Run for Your Life & Norwegian Wood-- with the amazing sitar of George Harrison) to masterpieces (In My Life, Michelle & a personal favorite because of the three part harmonies, Nowhere Man) this collection is suggested as a starting point when buying individual \\"non greatest hits\\" Beatles CDs. While you're at it, why not buy the full collection of Beatle CDs missing from your musical library?
B0001932ZA|5.0|You know the movie, so I'll cut to the details of this particular release...    The newly-remastered picture is so much clearer and more vivid than the original release and the DTS soundtrack is an awesome addition. After having heard it, I would've bought it for the DTS, alone. Who knew that a 17-year-old, stereo movie could be remastered to DTS quality and 6.1 surround so well (including very targeted use of the rear channels).    The extras are another story, as many people have stated. The \\"Lockdown on Main Street\\" is a thoroughly one-sided political statement. Regardless of anyone's beliefs, it doesn't belong on an action movie DVD. It feels like execs at Artisan were determined to put this documentary out there and picked \\"The Running Man\\" from their upcoming catalog as the best suitor.    The \\"Game Theory\\" documentary is just a piece in which creators and participants of early reality TV shows pat themselves on the back for their popularity. Perhaps fans of Survivor and other early reality TV will find it interesting, but I didn't.    In summary, the new remastering of the movie is \\"special,\\" but nothing else on either of the discs is. As someone else said, buy it for the movie. It really is one of the best remastering jobs that I've ever seen (or heard).
0316666343|5.0|Absolutely amazing--a one-of-a-kind novel.
0790729652|1.0|This is a fantastic movie, believe me.  The one star is because there should be more included.  For cryin' out loud, when this movie came out in 1989, there was a media hype that was out of this world.  Where is all the behind the scenes specials?  Trailers? Posters? Interviews? Commentary?!?!

0767830555|5.0|I don't understand why Bickle is considered a villian, let alone one of the greatest villians of all time (according to some big list by Time Magazine or something). If anything, he's a hero!! Sure, he wanted to assassinate the governor, and yeah, he probably is a racist, but he killed three bad suckas in order to save a 12 year old girl. That's gotta count for something.<br />Anyway, this movie is perfect. It's like Lost In Translation but with a revenge-seeking lonely psycho in the lead. I love the camera work of scorsese. simply amazing.<br />the nearly one and a half hour documentary is very cool as well. nice commentaries from peter boyle, jodie foster and some guys who worked on the movie.
B00005JMEW|1.0|This is the movie you get when there is no plot, no story line, no meaningful dialogue and you have to fill 2hours worth of film. <BR>It's bad enough that the director has to tell you what time line you are currently viewing and that ain't much help after all. Let's see, we were 4 years ago, 4 years later, two days past 4 years later and tomorrow 6 months ago. HUH? And don't forget the all important subtitles and animation he added to make sure you &quot;got it&quot;. I think at the very least he could have spent a little extra money on the English translation of the English dialogue because otherwise I can not tell what the H--- is going on!<BR>I finally &quot;got&quot; Pulp Fiction after the 12th viewing. I even managed to keep up with &quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot; even tho there were no subtitles and no Englsh to English translation. The actors even had characters to match their given nicknames! I loved that movie and have probably seen it ten times! BUT..........<BR>I guess it's me, apparently this is a Testosterone flick and since I don't have that particular hormone this movie could not get past my brain sensors. I swear if I could have found where Amazondotcom hides the 1/2 and 0 stars I would have made good use of them.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Fans of The Who, mid-to-late period Beatles, The Kinks &amp; 1970s rock, like myself, will hear similarities to these rock gods in the music of Aussie rockers Jet, so just sit back, relax &amp; enjoy the ride in this modern day interpretation of popular music of 30 years ago.<BR>     This CD includes the Best Song of 2004 so far: Are You Gonna Be My Girl? &amp; one of the best power ballads of the New Year: Look What You've Done. Other prime cuts: Last Chance, Rollover DJ, Get What You Need, Move On, Get Me Outta Here &amp; Cold Hard B****.<BR>     Yes, Chris &amp; Nic Cester of Jet sound &amp; sing like Keith Moon &amp; Roger Daltrey but this is a new, fresh infusion &amp; a modern day take on a classic genre. Get this CD if you hunger for the golden days of classic rock. 1971 lives!
B0001AP12G|5.0|I'm a huge rap fan, and i can honestly say that this CD blew me way. Lot's of my friend said was good but I didn't know it was this GOOD! definitly one of the best albums, an instant classic. The beats are exteremly cool. He also feature lots of good rappers on it, including Jay-Z. I am predicting that Kanye West will become one of the best rappers in the History of Hip Hop.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I really like war movies, but this one was hard for me to sit through. The concept of the movie was fine but the movie was so poorly done. The battle scenes were cheesy and unrealistic. The musical score was like a cheap action movie. I would avoid this one like the plague.
B0001I55OC|1.0|This was one of the most horribly acted movies I've ever seen. The explanation of time travel and the buttons to get back was poorly done, and the reaction from the young time travelers was...like, &quot;ok, we're going back in time 500 years to save professor. LET'S GO!!&quot; just terrible.
6305342776|4.0|This movie is truly one of the forgotten, yet flawed classics of the late 1970's. Nobody seemed to remember this movie except for those of us who truly loved it when we were children. What kid could forget the menacing presence of the robot Maximillian or the creepiness of the mysterious humanoids, not to mention the swirling black hole itself. <br />The only problem that I have with this movie now that I'm an adult is that it never seems to decide whether or not to be sophisticated adult sci-fi or shoot'em up kiddie-fare. It tends to flip flop back and forth with slightly irritating results.  The movie presents us with very dark themes about life, death and the nature of the universe, but then turns into a robotic western style shoot out complete with a cowboy sounding robot named Old B.O.B.  Religious themes are explored here as well, especially during the conclusion of the film, which add a much needed breath of fresh air.  In the end, the film is a mixture of things that really should not have shared the same story, but we have the massive success of STAR WARS at the time to thank for that.  <br />Science is yet another area in the film that is handled rather flippantly.  While attempts are made at realism down to the smallest detail in some areas, others simply don't hold up well at all.  Most sequences onboard the Palomino are well done, but many on the Cygnus ruin any sense of realism that was being attempted beforehand.  One scene shows the main characters exposed to the outside area of the Cygnus as the spacecraft enters the black hole.  Several minutes later, when a meteor rips the roof off a section of the ship`s agricultural garden, the vacuum of space kicks in and threatens everyone!  Moments later, the characters are again crawling around on the outside of the ship, where the vacuum of space should exist!  Furthermore, the intense gravity seems to affect no one at all, even though they are all directly exposed up close to this awesome force of nature.Go figure!  <br />The film repeatedly fails in the area of dialogue and plot several times over too.  The reason for this is the simple fact that there were many writers who served up revisions and changes to Jeff Rosenbrook`s original story.  This ultimately led to several convoluted plot devices being introduced through the dialogue that seem to appear out of nowhere, then in turn lead to nothing at all.  A perfect example of this is when Maximillian kills a character and Dr. Reinhardt, the man who controls the evil robot, suddenly asks for protection from it!  The whole scene just came straight out of left field!  There are other moments of babbling dialogue that makes one scratch their head in sheer disbelief, but regardless of these rather hilarious flaws the film still has plenty to offer.    <br />The special-effects and cinematography are what really steal the show here, both having earned the film Oscar nominations. The ghostly Cygnus lingering on the event horizon of a black hole and the Palomino's subsequent exploration are superbly rendered.  The matte paintings of space itself are beautiful, adding lots of blues and greens instead of the same old black that many other films have given us before and since.  The ship designs are beautiful, as are the awesome sets. Also worth noting is the journey into the black hole and the visually impressive renditions of Heaven and Hell, which features some of composer John Barry's most memorable and eerie music. <br />This long awaited remastered DVD edition is really breath-taking. The picture is so clear and crisp that you can see the wires that the robots are suspended on. I only wish that Disney would learn to release DVDs with more bonus features (audio commentary, interviews, TV spots, etc.). If you are interested in bonus material, I would suggest that you track down the Limited Collector's Edition which features the wide-screen video, 9 movie lobby cards, a 44 page booklet, and a really cool looking tin featuring a scene of the Cygnus spacecraft on the lid. The booklet is packed with all sorts of interesting things such as interviews with director Gary Nelson and matte artist Harrison Ellenshaw, tons of pictures and artwork, the script for the abandoned alternate ending, a reprint of the original Pressbook, and more.  It answers any and all questions that one could have about what went into the making of this movie, from its inception to the final print! This DVD edition only gets three stars due to its failure to include any of these truly informative extras!<br />All in all, the film is beautiful to look at, even compared to today's visual effects.  The film may sport some flawed writing and lapses in physics, but ultimately it is a fun adventure which does manage to present some interesting possibilities.  One does have to wonder what could have been done with this material in different hands, but I guess that is something we will never know!
B0001IN07Q|5.0|A Juno Award winner as Canada's Best New Artist, Bubl lives up to his billing.<BR>In every sense of the word, Bubl is a consumate professional whose obvious love for the music genre becomes evident as soon as he opens his mouth. His timing, phrasing and tone are incredibly mature for someone still so young, and the banter with his audiences shows an onstage maturity that is far beyond his years.<BR>I noticed the compact disc that comes with the d.v.d. has some songs recorded live at his shows, and to hear a voice so pure and perfect in a live recording is something else!<BR>Yes, Canada can claim our generations new World Class Superstar!!
B00005JMEW|3.0|I'm not sure where to start, this film left me kinda confused about the quality of movie Tarantino is capable of.Firstly, the violence was hyped in this movie and really there isn't much of it. It was looks pretty fake. So i dont know why everyone is so grossed out by this movie. The Plot was OK, typical revenge plot, not many twists, straightforward. The high point of Kill Bill Vol1 was the fight choreography and the music. Dialogue was cheesy, profane typical of Tarantino movies. I'm personally a big fan of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs. Four Rooms and From Dusk Till Dawn. This offering however left me somewhat dissapointed. I dont think i'll be rushing to the theaters to see Kill Bill Vol2 and i certainly won't be bying this DVD.
B00004U8JV|1.0|I hated this film. It was long, and didn't make sense. It tried to scare people, but it was more pathetic than scary. I don't think I even got a little bit scared in this film. This is the worst movie in the Jurassic Park Francise.
B00005JMEW|1.0|This movie was very stupid and comic like. I cannot believe i wasted a couple of hours in my life on this movie.
B00000JCOV|4.0|I know there are many people out there who don't like this band. I know that a lot of people who think that they have no talent. I'm not saying that they're an extremely talented band, they are too mainstream and their instruments aren't complex enough. I am giving them 4 stars because they succeed in entertaining me, and I enjoy listening to them. That's all.
0783240236|5.0|Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor are the gorgeous stars of this Hitchcock masterpiece, beautifully preserved in DVD with lots of fun and informative bonus features.  A must-have for your classic film collection.  Only thing missing is Suzanne Pleshette's participation in the &quot;Behind The Scenes&quot; documentary.
B00003CXXS|5.0|This was second best, Jurassic Park 1 was the best, that one really scared me. Jurassic Park 2 The Lost World was a joke. I couldn't stand watching it. It was so boring, and I hated the acting of Julian Moore. Jurassic Park 3 is a lot better. I think that it was good that they went to the extreme and made a Spinosaur vs. Tyranosaur scene. It was getting boring always seeing the Tyranosaur picking on people, but now they put on a vicious Predator. The Velociraptors were more detailed and better drawn. The plot was plain and simple, didn't care for it much. I liked the dinosaur effects mostly on this film, and on this film it is not boring with those long talking moments, but more on the action moments.

Sometimes i even put the book down and Said to myself &quot;oh...my..gosh! I can't believe it!&quot; I couldn't put this book down and stayed up until 5 in the morning because I just couldn't get enough!! Her writing style totally puts you in Emma's position and it feels like you're right there with her. If I was in the entertainment business...I would want to make this into a movie, no doubt! GET THIS BOOK! IT'S WORTH IT!!

B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright has an extraordinary talent for writing beautifully complex music and wrapping it around sarcastic, self-deprecating, post-modern lyrics. Go or Go Ahead and Beautiful Child are both complicated and interesting and good rock-pop tunes. Vicious World floats Rufus' voice over lush organ, and who can resist Vibrate with its refrain \\"My phone's on vibrate for you.\\" or it's comment \\"I tried to dance to Britney Spears, I must be getting on in years.\\" (...)
B0000C7GG2|5.0|This is such a beautiful album and i feel sorry for anyone who doesn't get the chance to hear it. Muse are definatley one of the most exciting band in the entire world, but i really don't get this whole muse/radiohead thing, its been a big debate in Britain since 'Showbiz' was released ( which is by the way another beautiful Muse cd)and I seriously can't see how they are similar. I mean maybe its because Thom Yorke and Matt Bellamy have similar voices, but I personally prefer Matt Bellamy's and Muse's music to Radiohead. They bore me. Muse have varied, original, strange, fantastic, creative, dynamic,adrenaline increasing music that takes you on a journey. As the album drifts into songs like ' sing for absolution','blackout' &amp;'endlessly' and storms into 'hysteria' &amp; 'stockholm syndrome', i can honestly say every song on this album is amazing. Infact every album Muse have done are amazing, so i urge you to buy 'Absolution' and then when you are swept away by its awesomeness buy 'Showbiz'&amp; 'Origin Of Symmetry'.<BR>          As Bellamy sings 'this is the end of the world..' so buy it now quickly!
B00005GL0P|3.0|When Rubber Soul was originally released in the U.S. on Capitol Records, &quot;Drive My Car&quot; was missing from it. It was thought not to fit with the rest of the album, and so it was replaced. In its place came John Lennon's &quot;It's Only Love&quot; and Paul McCartney's &quot;I've Just Seen a Face,&quot; two songs which made the American version superior to the current UK import. While &quot;Drive My Car&quot; can be easily found on the '62-'66 best-of collection, &quot;It's Only Love&quot; and &quot;I've Just Seen a Face&quot; cannot be found (Yes, &quot;It's Only Love&quot; is in the Beatles Anthology, but its an alternate version of the far superior original song that appeared on the American release. If ever it should be released, I'm sure Beatles fans would love to hear the American version of &quot;Rubber Soul.&quot;
B00006DEFA|4.0|THE DVD:  If you like this movie at all, it MUST be viewed on DVD (or in the theater of course).  Not only is this one of the best SOUNDING movies of all time - with Neville Mariner's wonderful renditions of Mozart's music - it is also on of the best LOOKING movies ever filmed.  As the documentary shows, it was filmed in Prague -which is the most eighteenth-century-looking city in Europe.  The film would be ruined in pan-and-scan - you need letterbox to be able to take in the breathtaking compositions.  The film looks and sounds great.  <br />That having been said, I don't think that they needed to offer a \\"two disc\\" edition.  The ONLY thing on the second disc is the documentary, which could have easily fitted on the first disc.  This is merely another instance of the studio jacking up the price by offering a \\"two disc special edition.\\"<br />THE DIRECTOR'S CUT:  Amadeus was a long movie to begin with; now, with the extra footage, it clocks in at almost exactly three hours.  This is a LONG movie.  However, having now seen both versions, the Director's Cut does make more sense.  For instance, we get to see what really happens between Salieri and Mozart's wife.  It is never quite clear why they hate each other in the original.  Even better, we get more of the old Salieri talking.<br />THE FILM ITSELF:  Peter Schaffer is one of the best, most underrated playwrights of our time.  Equus is one of the great masterpieces of modern theater.  The title credits get it right with \\"Peter Schaffer's Amadeus\\".  As the documentary shows however, the play was altered radically on its way from the stage to the screen (and not always for the better).  I can't help but feel, however, the Milos Forman is overrated as a filmmaker.  With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, he found a movie formula - that of the plucky iconoclast - and he has been remaking that film OVER AND OVER as The People vs. Larry Flint, Man in the Moon...and Amadeus.  Whenever he deviates from that formula, the films flop.<br />The main complaint people have against this film is the acting - specifically Tom Hulce as Mozart.  Perhaps it is because Milos Forman's first language is not English he misses the subtleties of performance.  In the documentary, he pontificates about how thousands of actors were tested, and how important casting is.  But the question remains - why didn't he do better?  He casts mostly American actors and, for some reason, you just can't buy eighteenth-century dialogue coming from contemporary American accents.  The exception to this, of course, is F. Murray Abraham, who won an Oscar for this performance.  He is an accomplished theater actor who knows how to use his voice.  Even though he does not affect an English accent, he knows how to do elevated dialogue so we believe his Salieri.  The best parts of the movie are of the old Salieri reciting Peter Schaffer's wonderful dialogue over the music of Mozart.

B00005JLZN|4.0|scanning the negative reviews posted here, the nay-sayers seem to be divided into two camps: those who say the movie was too predictable; and those who say they can't believe the ending. presumably, one reason the latter group is incredulous is because they didn't see it coming. funny how you get completely opposite views.<br />me, i didn't see the ending coming, but i do think it made perfect sense. many objected that spacey and linney undermined their own cause by their &quot;stunt&quot;. i don't agree. first, the full story wasn't meant to be disclosed to the public, only to the reporter. second, and more important, the ending was not done solely to prove a point, as many have suggested. in fact, linney was already terminally ill and spacey's fortunes had fallen to the point where he had little to live for. the so-called &quot;stunt&quot; was really a way to make their lives - and their inevitable deaths - more meaningful. making a point about capital punishment was only one part of it, the public dimension. there were very real private considerations as well.<br />many also commented that the ending didn't make sense. i think it does. spacey knows that he's used winslet to convey his public AND private message (to his son). it's to assuage his guilt that he sends the tape at the end. how does he know that winslet won't tell all? because she's proven that she can be trusted to respect the confidentiality of her sources: if she won't betray &quot;kiddy porn scum&quot;, why would she betray an innocent man?<br />but even if the public doesn't know the whole truth, won't spacey still be an &quot;anti-captial punishment nuthead&quot; (to paraphrase one reviewer) in winslet's eyes? maybe. and only she would know. but judging from her reaction at the end, i'd say, if anything, she felt great compassion and understanding for spacey. compassion for his suffering. understanding of his actions. and i don't know what the reviewer was watching who said spacey had a &quot;dull&quot; look in his eyes when he gazed in the camera in the last scene, but i can't recall the last time i saw a look of such profound sadness. it was a very moving moment.<br />there are many other objections that don't stand up under scrutiny. for example, one reviewer commented that the linchpin of the story was the tv confrontation between spacey and the governor of texas where spacey supposedly wasn't able to name a single innocent man who had been mistakenly killed. the reviewer couldn't believe spacey didn't have a comeback since there apparently have been cases where just such a travesty has happened. leaving aside the question of whether this is the &quot;linchpin&quot;, if you listen closely to this scene, the question wasn't &quot;name one man who has been mistakenly killed?&quot;; it was &quot;name one man OUT OF THE 131 WHO HAVE BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN TEXAS DURING MY TENURE who was innocent?&quot;. there's a big difference between these two questions. the gov was answering  for his state's record, under his watch. he's saying &quot;show me where I'VE made a mistake. if you can do that, then maybe i'll reconsider MY STATE'S policy.&quot; this makes sense. why should the gov of texas answer for other jurisdictions or administrations? he should, and only can, answer for his own actions. which is exactly what he does.<br />another reviewer objected that it was obvious what spacey was up to when he hired an &quot;incompetent&quot; lawyer to defend him. &quot;the film is too predictable&quot;, he cried. actually, the lawyer wasn't incompetent at all. if he wasn't effective, it was BY DESIGN: he was in on the scheme from the very start. this is revealed near the end when we see the relation between the cowboy and the lawyer, especially the transfer of money. counsel &quot;botched&quot; the defense because that's what spacey wanted.<br />so maybe the plot wasn't so &quot;predictable&quot; after all? there are other objections like these that also fall apart on closer examination. i could go through them one by one, but i don't have the time or space to do that. MY only objection is that the film does occasionally go over-the-top in making its points. it does get a little preachy. this is more an aesthetic and artistic flaw, however, than an ideological or polemical one - more how the message is conveyed than what the message is. <br />good film. definitely worth a rental, and maybe even a purchase if you're a big spacey fan. to the naysayers i'll just say: watch the film again, and then tell me if you still think it's &quot;too predictable&quot; or flawed.
0553212443|5.0|Charles Dickens's classic novel, A Christmas Carol, is his most famous and beloved story. Millions around the globe have read this touching book, about brotherly love and charity, since it was first published. Countless people have seen Ebenezer Scrooge, the selfish and unkind man, transform in to a kind and generous person by the visits of four mysterious ghosts. <br />The story begins in the afternoon of a frigid Christmas Eve, as a mean-spirited man named Ebenezer Scrooge sits in his office. Scrooge is a cold-hearted and selfish miser, who isn't in the spirit of Christmas. Every so often, he shouts, \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" He doesn't even buy coal for the fireplace, so he and his clerk freeze away. No one likes him, and no one stands up to him. Dickens describes him thus: \\"No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.\\" However, this is exactly what Scrooge wants - to be in his own world.<br />Dickens starts out the story by stating that Scrooge's former partner, Jacob Marley, is dead. Then, he reverts back to what Scrooge is up to. As it is Christmas Eve, Scrooge isn't happy. He scares all the carolers away, and refuses to donate money to the poor. When the day is finally over, he goes back to his house, and tries to go to sleep. As he locks the door, he sees an apparition. There is Jacob Marley's ghost - looking right at him! Scrooge is shocked at first, and still is shocked when Marley's phantom tells him some surprising news. The ghost explains that there will be three other ghosts yet to come: the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Then, he leaves.<br />As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge. The ghost of the past shows Scrooge how he used to be. Scrooge discovers that his life was somewhat pleasant, but still lonely. The ghost of the present reveals to Scrooge his more recent attitude toward Christmas. It shows Scrooge the consequences of his actions, most of which are to Scrooge's dislike. The ghost also informs Scrooge how other people are celebrating. Dancing, playing blind man's buff, and caroling aren't part of Scrooge's world for certain. The ghost of the future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him; actually everyone is happy that he is gone. Meanwhile, all of these visions have Scrooge sobbing in tears and he is finally ready to make changes in his life. After the final ghost leaves, Scrooge runs about his little town donating money, greeting people, and visiting his nephew and clerk's family. It turns out to be a very happy Christmas after all.<br /> I liked A Christmas Carol very much. Charles Dickens's style is very descriptive. I especially liked the vivid verbs and adjectives Dickens used when he described Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, gasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!\\" As for Scrooge, I liked him a lot. The book was funny when he said something completely nonsensical like \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" On a scale of one through ten, I would give A Christmas Carol a ten. It was enjoyable and interesting to read, especially over winter break, as it heartens the spirit of Christmas itself.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of the matrix, it's too cunfusing, and to much computerized.  2/3's of the movie was computer.The last fightes are, like the battle of zion, the last neo and smith fight, mostly CGI.The only one that was the best was the 1st Matrix, that had alot of more guns and more possable wall running scenes. In this one people run on ceilings. thats pretty stupid to me, and theres alot of goths that are really freaky lookin at frist, then you watch this movie a 2nd time and there not so freaky lookin. The plot is very confusing but also very creative, worth 2 stars. see this if you want to find out what happens, not if you just like kung fu movies.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I saw Kill Bill twice in the theater and could not wait for it to come out on DVD, packed with bonus features. Alas, one commentary and some trailers. Sigh...<br /><br />This film is still an awesome tale of revenge, with Uma Thurman as the Bride, who awakens from a coma and begins visciously and methodically taking out her former co-DiVAS. The anime sequence, telling us of the childhood suffering of O-ren Ishii is even more spectacular than in the theater! The special effects are top-notch, even the sounds of the swords, and are more cartoonish than gory. It is truly the little things that make this a unique film, including a soundtrack produced by the RZA.<br /><br />I can't wait to see the second installment, hopefully it gets a better DVD treatment when the time comes.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Like a nice dream that you wake up from with a smile on your face that will in turn make your day, this is exactly the feeling I got after watching Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's second feature after her acclaimed debut Virgin Suicides.The first thing that struck me was how original the film was, and how simple and gentle the plot is,yet at the same time how deeply significant dealing with themes that many viewers can identify with about friendship,alienation, and loneliness.<BR>Certainly it has one of the most original opening scenes,I would go as far as saying,in Cinema history..one that will 'stare you right in the face' and will definitely bring a smile.<BR>Bob Harris an aging movie star who has clearly seen better roles is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, also staying in the same hotel is Charlotte a east side intellectual young wife who is with her very busy photographer husband. <BR>In between discovering a whole new city, and finding some difficulties adjusting to the jet lag, the language barrier and their respective state of loneliness away from home, they meet up and form a friendship that will help them cope with their temporary but bewildered and confused situation.<BR>Through their encounters, we learn that their friendship was not only sealed because of homesickness, but because they both found in each other a needed breath of fresh air that enlivened the dull routine of their lives both in Tokyo and the US. Indeed, Tokyo is only a place that triggers and exposes the deep need for change, albeit short lived because at the end, when the actor's job is done, he knows that now matter how much he found in Charlotte some comfort in his middle age crisis that was turning into affection and intimacy, and no matter how much Charlotte found in the actor the stimulation and closeness she lacks in her marriage, each will soon have to go back to their respective lives and families.<BR>The last scene when Harris stops his cab after spotting Charlotteand runs to her, whispering something that remains intelligible, then they kiss for the first time, and he departs smiling, was a very powerful one indeed..it opens lots of unanswered possibilities as to the nature of this brief conversation, but it really does not matter because they finally depart for the first time in their stay satisfied.<BR>Bill Murray, I believe contributed greatly to the movie's success..He is a truly comedy genius that reminds me of Peter Sellers or even Louis De Funes, actors who can express so much just with one look.Scarlett Johansson was a very able match, playing against a comedy giant like Murray, and I believe she is one of the best actresses of her generation, (and yes she has a really sweet laugh).<BR>The writing was excellent and Coppola managed to infuse gentle humor with three dimensional characters and with lots of sympathy, compassion and dignity. <BR>Lost In Translation therefore is a type of movie that is rarely filmed these days, one that is beautifully shot, written,and directed by a woman who proved that the term Daddy's girl is in her case, very well earned.
B0001I55OC|3.0|Without regurgitating all the old canards about the problems posed by the tranposition of literary works to the screen, let's just say that this adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel is decent, if not overwhelmingly so. Coming as it does on the heels of LOTR I/II/III, practically any film based on a novel will fail the test - this one's no different.<br />As popcorn entertainment, though, it's perfectly serviceable, if a little too compressed. Crichton's conundrum takes place over 36 hours, Richard Donner's adaptation reduces that to 6. The rest can easily be derived from that fundamental change. On the other hand, where Crichton needs time, literally, to describe life and the physical environment of the 14th century, a film can accomplish the same in an instant. LOTR (all three, for example) - in the original, verbal format, spends an inordinate amount of time describing things - places, the weather, emotive states, etc.<br />Can anyone say with a straight face that the issue of &quot;acting&quot; should even be mentioned in such a film as this? Please, hang it up. I suspect the cognoscenti of science fiction film have come to &quot;expect&quot; everything will boggle the mind and the eyes. Sorry. This is a perfectly decent film of its kind. I would have preferred a lot more detail, and not nearly as much compression - but it's interesting that even so telescoped, the film still runs at 115 minutes. Think about it.<br />Read the novel - see the film - then read the novel again. I don't expect my comic books to be the source of great revelatory anything - just plain, simple fun. Why, even the LOTR films had to cut the guts out of the original material - to get it down to 9.5 hours (theatrical versions).<br />My only real problem with the film is the score - which is horrible. Poor Benny Herrmann and John Williams, good composers both, have been ripped off so many times now that all one has to do is to establish a characteristic syncopated martial ostinato, then play it to death. Such was the case here, in spades. As a composer, I find such things maddening in the extreme. A bad score can take a weak film and really do it in. This one does virtually that to this film.y it to death. Such was the case here, in spades. As a composer, I find such things maddening in the extreme.

6305508550|5.0|From the creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill, brings you a movie that shows in important message in life, \\"work sucks\\". The performances in this movie are amazing. They are amazing from performances from everybody. This film is a smart and intellectual film about a day in a life in a hard worker. And how they get mad of all the work they have to suffer through. <br />The story goes as Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) really just doesn't feel like going to work anymore, he really really hates it, and wants to get fired. With his new attitude and his new girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) he gets promoted and still hates his job and wants to make his boss pay for making his life miserable. He then figures a scam with his friends Michael and Samir. It is a triumph! <br />This film has really no special features. It has the theatrical trailer for the film, widescreen anamorphic 1:85:1 ratio, and cast and crew info. They should really come out with a special edition set of this movie. It should have commentary by Mike Judge. But the film still covers it. It is a smart comedy. Can be complicated, so you made need to watch this more than once if you don't know about office jobs like me. This is a must see film.

B0000062Y2|5.0|Although I also bought the original LP, I found this version to be the best. I thought the voices were superior, and there were more songs.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This is the sequel to \\"Baby One More Time.\\" Just like a sequel to a movie, this album basically sticks to the same theme as the original, yet adds even more punches and sparkle, and leaves you with a clue of what is to come next. <br />\\"Oops I did it again,\\" and \\"Stronger\\" are the flip sides of \\"one more time\\" and \\"Crazy,\\" but better, and um, stronger. Like those earlier tracks, these songs are all about anthemic choruses, and teen romance. Unlike those songs, these ones show off Power Britney, the girl that is in control of her relationships. Even the lyrics reference each other. In \\"one more time\\" Britney proclaims that her lonliness is killing her, and then in \\"stronger\\" she declares her lonliness ain't killing her no more. As the first two songs off the album, you get a sense that this album will be about teen girl empowerment, and in a way, it is. <br />\\"Don't go knockin'\\" is a bouncy break up dance song, \\"What U See is what U get,\\" and \\"Can't Make you love me\\" are sing along songs with female dominance and power themes. These songs are nice follow ups to \\"Baby one more time\\"'s \\"Soda Pop,\\" \\"I will be there,\\" and \\"Born to make you happy.\\" <br />Then of course we have the sappy ballads. But there's good news! Britney enlisted the cream of the crop of this genre to write these tracks. Shania Twain wrote the aching, but surprisingly atmospheric \\"Don't let me be the last to know,\\" and Diane Warren wrote \\"When your eyes say it,\\" which is disposable, but features really good vocals from Britney.<br />Instead of the embarassing \\"E-mail my Heart,\\" \\"From the Bottom of my Broken Heart,\\" and \\"I will still love you,\\" we now have the saccharine \\"Once kiss from you,\\" and Britney's first co-written track, \\"Dear Diary,\\" sounds like something out of Grease or Cry-Baby. <br />Britney replaces Sonny and Cher with the Rolling Stones in the form of a re-made \\"I Can't Get no Satisfaction,\\" which has a nice breathy intro, (...).<br />Speaking of cringe inducing, \\"Lucky\\" sticks out like a sore thumb on this album. The song tries to be thought provoking, but comes off as whiny instead. <br />With \\"Oops I did it again,\\" Britney proves that she is still a well oiled machine capable of churning out fun pop songs and love ballads. She provides more interesting song themes than her debut had to offer, and even better dance hooks. More importantly, she gives a small taste of her own songwriting abilities which would come to fruition in her forthcoming efforts.
B000002HRE|4.0|After taking over the world with the Black Album in 1991, Metallica felt (and probably rightfully so) that the world was their oyster. But the dramatic (albeit not unforseen) change from the masters of heavy metal to the laid-back, mellower Metallicats still took the world by surprise, to say the least.<br />Reload follows the pattern set by Load - open with a speedy, nice rocker, close with a moody, epic song. Although Reload seems to lose its way somewhere. &quot;Fuel&quot;, as a song, has some of the worst pre-St. Anger Metallica lyrics ever penned, and a riff that would have been discarded instantly by the band years ago. Still a fun song, though. &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; with Marianne Faithfull left many a Metallica fan scratching their head at the weird riff, the somewhat un-Hetfield like lyrics, and of course, the nasal-sounding Ms. Faithfull's vocals. <br />&quot;Devil's Dance&quot;, &quot;Better Than You&quot;, &quot;Prince Charming&quot; &amp; &quot;Attitude&quot; could easily rank as the most boring and insignificant Metallica songs out there. All but ignored live, these songs don't have a single redeeming quality to make them stand out by themselves. The album's successes come in the form of &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, with its haunting intro, &quot;Low Man's Lyric&quot;, the surprisngly successful non-rocker with hurdy-gurdy and violin, &quot;The Unforgiven II&quot;, with its country-feel and some of James Hetfield's most personal lyrics, and &quot;Fixxxer&quot;, the mammoth album closer following in the footsteps of Load's similar closing epic, &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;.<br />All in all, not the best Metallica album. This'd appeal mainly to diehard Metallica fans, or those who want some laid-back, mellow hard rock. Which was what Metallica apparently wanted to play, apparently.
B00000IBRI|4.0|After watching Dario Argento's 1985 film \\"Phenomena,\\" I have finally started to make serious inroads into his substantial body of work. It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films up until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. Even Troma, the flagship of flaccid filmmaking, released a version of Argento's \\"The Stendhal Syndrome.\\" It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days, more people know the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a few years in the 1980s and 1990s, Argento drifted away from his tried and true giallo formula, only recently returning to some semblance of form with \\"Stendhal\\" and \\"Sleepless.\\" \\"Phenomena\\" has a few giallo elements, but overall it is definitely different from his early thrillers.<br />Jennifer Connelly (\\"Dark City,\\" \\"Requiem for a Dream\\") plays Jennifer Corvino, the teenaged daughter of a movie star sent to an exclusive Swiss boarding school for girls. She never fits in despite her distinguished pedigree largely due to a strangeness about her that the other students immediately pick up on. Her only friend at the school is her French roommate, and her only pal outside of school is Professor John McGregor (Donald Pleasence), a bug researcher working on a spate of particularly grisly murders. Corvino lives at the school for only a short time before strange things start happening. First, she starts sleepwalking, a habit not unfamiliar to her but one that causes quite a bit of consternation amongst her classmates and teachers. Moreover, when she suffers one of her nocturnal adventures, she mentally connects to the same killer McGregor is investigating. Second, and an even eerier occurrence, is Corvino's burgeoning ability to communicate and control insects through psychic manipulation. Soon, Jennifer embarks on a mission to track down the murderer, a task made more personal when her roommate dies under the killer's knife.<br />Corvino's situation is a treacherous one, fraught with perils for her and everyone she knows. McGregor soon falls prey to the killer, effectively leaving Jennifer alone in a hostile world. As the young heroine desperately attempts to contact her father's lawyer by phone to get her out of this mess, she moves closer and closer to identifying the warped soul (souls, perhaps?) behind the heinous crimes. Since \\"Phenomena\\" comes from the mind of Dario Argento, it almost goes without saying that twists and turns abound as the conclusion draws near. Furthermore, the movie contains many scenes of Argento's trademark violence, the truly cringe inducing brutality that turns the stomachs of even the most jaded gorehounds. \\"Phenomena\\" may not be Dario's most graphically violent film, or even his most intricate in terms of suspense or plot, but it is deeply disturbing. It is also magnificently photographed in the director's trademark style. The movie manages to achieve cloying claustrophobia (the shots in the house and the tunnels) balanced with expansive views of the Swiss countryside and the grounds of the school.<br />I am a sucker for any film with Donald Pleasence on the cast list, so praising his performance here is pure overkill on my part. I will say the McGregor character gives Pleasence one of his more restrained horror film roles, a role he pulls off perfectly. Jennifer Connelly, on the other hand, outright wows in her role as the beleaguered Jennifer Corvino. The actress was only fourteen years old when she played the part, but is so stunningly beautiful you can barely look at her directly. She carries off the Corvino character perfectly, capturing the poise and attitude of a famous actor's daughter who has been there and done that to a T. I had to check Connelly's age several times just to make sure she wasn't older than fourteen; she often comes off as someone in their early twenties, at least. How can someone this young look so comfortable in front of the camera? If I had never seen Connelly in another role than this one, I would assume her success in Hollywood was assured based on this part alone. Argento knows how to get good performances out of his actors; he even knows how to work with animals, as one of the main characters in \\"Phenomena\\" is McGregor's razor wielding pet chimpanzee.<br />DVD companies generally recognize Dario Argento films have many fans, so even the sparsest disc usually has a few extras. \\"Phenomena\\" has a lot, including a commentary from Dario, an interview with the director on the Joe Franklen show, trailers, behind the scenes stuff, two music videos, and biographies and filmographies. The movie is a winner although there were a few things about it I didn't like. I didn't care for the odd mix of heavy metal music (from bands like Iron Maiden and Motorhead) and eerie synthesizer tracks from Claudio Simonetti of Goblin fame. I don't have anything against Iron Maiden, not at all, but I thought their inclusion here took something away from the film. I also would have liked more stylish giallo elements. Still, \\"Phenomena\\" should find its way onto any horror fan's list, and its required viewing for fans of Argento.layed the part, but is so stunningly beautiful you can barely look at her directly.

B00005JMEW|1.0|First off, let me say that like most people, I enjoyed Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  In fact, I watched them several times without getting tired of them.  I even watched Jackie Brown a couple of times.  But I'm having a tough time getting through even my first viewing of Kill Bill.  I have been watching it today 10-15 minutes at a time b/c it's just too damn BORING.<br />This movie is basically an extended music video, interrupted by bouts of violence and the kind of dialog you would expect a 16-year-old to come up with.  Anybody who's calling this movie &quot;artistic&quot; is seriously lacking in IQ.  Tarentino basically took a random sampling of popular culture and made it into a &quot;video&quot;-- I wouldn't even call this a movie.  <br />All the Asian characters are caricatures of tired stereotypes.  In fact, ALL the characters look and act like they belong in some lame-ass comic book your kid brother just drew up.  To boot, not only does this movie lack a message, damn-near half of it is pure filler.  By filler I mean half the time you're just looking at people sitting or walking or driving with music in the background.  None of these montages advance the plot, so the only purpose they serve is to make the movie long enough for cinematic release.<br />The fact that most people are giving this 5 stars is a testament to the stupidity of the American public.  It barely even passes for a 70's B-movie, big budget or no.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Actually, this movie should get 6 out 5 stars...<BR>One could probably write for ages about this outstanding film, but I'll just pick out one aspect: the double DVD features a kind of running commentary by Bertolucci, Claudia Cardinale, Christopher Frayling, and others. Among them there is John Carpenter, whose wry comments are a special treat. He would say stuff like, &quot;I'm not quite sure what that meant. (slight pause; then with tongue in cheek) I'm sure he (Sergio Leone) didn't know either.&quot; And in spite of that he also can't help admitting that this is, quite simply, one of the very best Westerns ever made.
0689829590|4.0|You hear about this sometimes.  An artist becomes so famous and influential that they're eventually able to go back to some of their earlier works and (to their mind) improve them.  Steven Spielberg did it with \\"E.T.\\"  Singer/songwriters are constantly reinventing their old classics.  Eric Carle did it with \\"Papa, Please Get the Moon For Me\\".  And though I usually object heartily to artistic preferences changing old classics that technically belong to the masses (ya hear that Speilberg???), in Carle's case I'm willing to make an exception.  Changing a mildly interesting story into a complicated (but hearty) pseudo pop-up book, Carle has recreated his art the only way an artist should: he has made it better.<br />Following in the tradition of such children-asking-their-parents-for-the-moon classics as \\"Many Moons\\" (highly recommended!), in this simple story a girl asks her father to please get her that large circular piece of rock in the sky.  The father complies, hauling out the longest ladder anyone has ever seen and taking it to the tallest mountain in the world.  Initially depressed by the fact that the moon is (surprise!) too large to bring to his daughter, the father is eventually comforted by the moon itself.  It tells the man that if he just waits for it to wax and wane, it'll become a manageable size in no time.  This turns out to be the case and the little girl is delighted when the father hands her the sliver that is the moon to play with.<br />The book flap says that by reading this book, children will come to realize that, \\"even a seemingly unreachable goal can actually be attained\\".  I dunno about that.  If that's the moral of this story, then I want no part of it.  No, the message I received from this tale is that a man will sometimes move heaven and earth to bring his children the things they want the most in the world.  They might not always succeed, but if a man were able to get the moon for his daughter, he'd do so.<br />Carle's illustrations are classic Carle.  I'm personally a little lukewarm on him.  The pictures here are a little more swirly and paint based than his usual cut paper concoctions.  The book flap mentions that for the reissue of this book Carle, \\"created new illustrations for his original story\\", so I do not know how much he has changed.  If the pictures are lovely, however, they are merely a compliment to the book's real joys.  Pages in this story fold out to reveal the enormity of the father's task.  A single ladder, once the pages are unfolded, takes over a four page spread.  And the moon itself, when at its full capacity, opens up to become larger than the book that holds it.  The effect is stunning and enjoyable for those kids that love interactive pictures.  Nicest of all is the durability of the paper used for these effects.  I'm sure we've all seen the effects a three-year old can wreak on a pop-up book it loves.  I took this book, published in 1986, from my local library and the pages STILL work just as well as the day they were made.  If that's not sturdiness, I don't know what is.<br />Should you be scientifically inclined and you object to such notions as a moon being physically smaller when it is but a crescent, avoid this story.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy a good fold out pop-up book enlivened by colorful cut-out illustrations as much as the next guy, then I highly recommend this delightful piece of lunar propaganda.  It is certain to be beloved of millions of star gazing children worldwide.lassic Carle.  I'm personally a little lukewarm on him.

B00009P1O0|5.0|After \\"Harvest,\\" Neil's record company nixed \\"Toinght's the Night\\" because it was too dark, \\"On the beach\\" was his response.  If you want to hear lyrics that bite like a strung out Doberman Pincher, this is the one to get.  The pinacle of his songwriting career, made grittier by his long depression, On The Beach takes on popular icons of the day as well as Neil himself with equal disdain.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|Let me start by saying that I viewed this movie in the theatre and was, as I am with many movies today, appalled to find that people are bringing children to R-rated flicks. This is a wonderfully directed blend of eerie mystery, dark comedy and offers a refreshing view on relationships and sacrifice. The direction was beatiful and the content mature. As a major critic of Ashton Kutcher's acting ability I must say that this role bodes well with his often aloof expressions, and I did recommend it to my friends. Definitely worth owning.   Hope this helps.

B000002HMH|1.0|I was a fan prior to the black album though I don't go back as far as some die hards. My favorite album of theirs was always &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; I enjoyed the &quot;black&quot; album. I have TRIED repeatedly to enjoy this album. They've changed, I've changed, and it just isn't working anymore. I found nothing inspirational in this album. It was boring and flat. Bob Rock works well for a band like Motley Crue; he's screwed up Metallica. I was genuinely excited about the release until I got home and put it in the CD player. That was when my smile went away. I just wasn't feeling it. It felt childish, trendy, artificial. These weren't angry boys with a social conscience anymore; they turned into the pop-metal bands they claimed to have despised. If that's what they want to be then so be it. I've said my goodbyes and won't be spending another dollar on any new Metallica releases...

0571194370|3.0|\\"Intimacy\\" is rightly valued for its dispassionate presentation of the duplicity and selfishness of men in love. Intimacy is both the goal and destroyer of monogamy, Kureishi seems to being saying, and he certainly pulls no punches when it comes to explaining why. Men always want someone else. Blame nature, blame nurture, blame contemporary social demands incompatible with six hundred millennia of evolutionary development. Whatever the case, we seem to be programmed to break women's hearts and to ruin our own happiness in the process.  Kureishi gives an agonizingly candid insight into the machinations of male ego and self-justification. My problem with it is that many happily married men would probably say, \\"Speak for yourself, Hanif.\\" And rightly so. What of the men who live perfectly happy lives devoted to their wives and children? It doesn't mean they aren't attracted to other women, it doesn't mean they don't ever think of straying. It just means they don't go through with it. Are they all repressed? Are they all kidding themselves? Do they secretly hate their wives and resent their children? Or have they learned that the infantile fantasy of endlessly variable sexual experience is precisely that, and therefore not worth pursuing?  Kureishi doesn't seem to allow that such men might exist.  He tells only half the story on men, and so this tragi-comic articulation of male infidelity comes very close to celebrating it as natural, inevitable and therefore of little consequence. I'm not taking the moral high ground here.  I'm just acknowledging what Kureishi refuses to: that some men aren't cheating dogs.  My only other quibble is that this novel is too long, even at 120 pages. It wouldn't seem that way if I hadn't previously read an exquisitely edited extract, published as a short story in The New Yorker, which said everything the novel says, but better.  It was less totalizing, less cockily assured of its own position - and therefore closer to the truth.  (It's still available in \\"The Art Of The Story\\", edited by Daniel Halpern - a collection well worth a look.)ll available in \\"The Art Of The Story\\", edited by Daniel Halpern - a collection well worth a look.)
B00005JMEW|5.0|As a major fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I was more than excited when I went to see this film in theatres. I had heard nothing but good things about. I was however a tad bit skeptical when I saw advertisements and I realized that it would be nothing like his other films I had loved so much.<br />While I was correct in assuming that this film was nothing like his others, there was nothing to be skeptical about. This film is amazing. It is the story about Uma Thurman's character known only as 'The Bride'. After Bill and four other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad(DiVAS) shoot up her wedding and leave her in a coma for four years, she sets out to take revenge.<br />This is the first half of the film following The Bride as she sets her sight on her first two members of the DiVAS. It is an all out hardcore and bloody brawl that shows us a side of Quentin's abilities that we've as yet to see in any of his films thus far. While there are multiple scenes of mild, low key conversation, this film truly shines in it's well choreographed fight scenes. Another plus side is the short anime scene Quentin put in to add to the effect of the movie.<br />Clearly not a movie for everyone (especially those with a weak stomach) but truly a sight to behold, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet again another amazing film that Quentin Tarantion has supplied for us to see.

B00006LWSF|5.0|Loved 8 mile and feel the same about the soundtrack. Features new songs from some of the best rappers out today (Nas and Rakim for example) and even allows Em to showcase the great Shady Records talent. The song are all relevant to the film in one way or another and they all grow on you. Although I was dissapointed to not be able to recognise hardly any songs from the film (as you'll find the songs like 'shook ones part 2' and 'feel my flow' on the cd entitled &quot;more music from 8mile&quot;, but each song is great and adds to the message and emotion Eminem wanted to hand across in 8mile. <br />Surprising how no one seems to like Boomkats 'wasting my time' as although I hadn't heard of the artist and hearing the slow beat immediatly put me off. This is a classic example of 'dont read a book by its cover' as its without a doubt one of the best tracks on the album purely for the lyrics and one I think you should check out. Being a Shady Records fan I loved the songs produced and rapped by them (including 'love me' and '8 mile') and by ending with 'Rabitt run' ends it all off explosively and I think its a great companion to the film, and great even if you dont like the flim as you'll still find some great rap songs to listen to.
B0001I55OC|1.0|This movie is bad. It makes the audience jump through a never ending series of ridiculous hoops to follow the &quot;plot&quot;. I must admit I read the book before seeing the movie and this colored my expectations quite heavily. However, that being said the movie still falls short when not compared to its literary predecessor. The &quot;acting&quot; is laughably bad, the lines are so trite I found myself rolling my eyes every five minutes and no amount of special effects could save it from these shortcomings.<br />P.S. Someone please beg Michael Crichton to start writing his own screenplays, or at least proofread them to avoid this horrible tripe...
B000001EC1|4.0|Cross Road is a 14 track (11 previously released) Greatest Hits collection Bon Jovi released in 1994.  The album was a huge success and gave them one of their biggest singles,  Always.<br />The bulk of the album focuses on Bon Jovi's peak in popularity, roughly 1986-1990.  With Slippery When Wet and New Jersey, Bon Jovi were one of the top hard rock bands of the late 1980's.  3 tracks off each album.<br />With Cross Road, you can get the biggest of the big Bon Jovi hits from 84-94 on one package,   prepare to ride on the steel horse or be shot down in a blaze of glory whenever you wish to be.<br />However, I think it's time for a Cross Road 2.  Bon Jovi's had quite a few hits since this album,  and they can put in some of the &quot;missing&quot; hits off this album, such as the #3 Born To Be My Baby, the #9 Living In Sin, the radio smash Never Say Goodbye, the top 20 In These Arms, and others.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have reached the conclusion that all critics who love this movie have not seen the films of Wong Kar-Wai. This is a truly abysmal imitation of a Wong film (Sofia Coppola thanked the director in her Oscar speech for &quot;inspiration&quot;), in particular &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. Whereas Wong's film boasts sparse but rich dialogue, a complex storyline, beautiful cinematography and enchanting music, Coppola's imitation has sparse and pointless dialogue, an underdeveloped and shallow plot, and merely modest cinematography and musical direction. Murray does a fine job in this movie, but Coppola clearly has very little to offer other than truly offensive stereotypes of Japanese people. Watching this movie was a totally painful experience for me, and I am so glad that I only rented it from the video store, to which I promptly returned the DVD. I recommend everyone to stay away from this movie and buy something from Wong Kar-Wai instead. Try &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; or &quot;Chungking Express&quot;...you will be amply rewarded. This is worse than an imitation crab-stick, and it is about time the critics realized that.

I appreciate their kind of music but just because they're good doesn't mean Britney sucks. Especially the reviewer jlennonfan who has written 6 reviews so far here. We get your point!

It's pretty different from her old stuff but I'm sure you'll like most of the songs here. If you are just a listener of some pop hiphop music, this is worth your money. If you are a younger Britney fan, wait till you're above 14 to purchase this. <BR>I liked all the songs in this album though Early morning, Outrageous and Boom boom may get boring after a while. <BR>If you're into classical or rock, leave this alone and stop coming here to write mean reviews about this CD

Truss's observations on commas, apostrophes, and periods (or, \\"full stops\\" in the British style)<BR>had me nodding my head in total agreement.<br />This relatively short book can be digested in a single evening, but I guarantee you will pick it up again and again.
B00000IPAX|4.0|i really love this cd! my friends got me hooked on Blink-182 recently and they bought me this one for my birthday...and i love it! i remember when All The Small Things was played endlessly on the radio, and I really liked the song, but I never knew who it was by. When i was listening to this CD and heard all the small things come on i was so happy i finally found what band played that song! if you like blink-182, you NEED this cd!
B000099T2L|4.0|the album is cool<BR>she did a great job<BR>i don't like her but what she did is wonderful<BR>RESPECT;Buy this album,cuz it worths your money believe me<BR>except if u don't like her like me
B000002B30|4.0|With an artist the caliber of &quot;Bruce Springsteen&quot; it would be difficult to narrow his career down to 18 tracks, but mostly I think these are good picks. This is also a good time to point out that this is a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, not a &quot;Best Of&quot;, therefore his most popular material was selected. Of course I'll still ask where's &quot;Tunnel Of Love&quot;, &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze Out&quot;, &quot;I'm On Fire&quot;, and my personal fave &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;? But, it does include &quot;Born To Run&quot;, &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;, &quot;Human Touch&quot;, and &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, and that should please most casual fans, which this collection is for anyway. If you would like twice as much, check out &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot;.
B000099T2L|4.0|Her first solo album is good<BR>Honnestly she is a great singer/performer/songwritter<BR>In: me,myself and i,she eventually tells the truth about liars,and she does it in a subtile way,not like in destiny's childs albums where the lyrics are really focused on \\"bad men\\"<BR>But still, this album is focus on erotism,on sex even,  the girl knows how to talk about it in an \\"unchoking\\" way.<BR>I heard stories about her and her man, JAY-Z should really be happy of her declarations.<BR>Brievely,the girl knows the music world and prooved it by this, let's say beautiful album.<BR>AALIYAH i'll always love you,don't worry no one will ever take ur place not even beyonce<BR>RIP babygirl i love you.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Upon first listen to this, I felt it was missing a few hits. Then I realized those were from his &quot;Genesis&quot; days. However this is still full of his solo songs, most of which are great. Included is &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot;, &quot;Easy Lover&quot;, &quot;Sussudio&quot;, and the huge &quot;Against All Odds&quot;. Plus it's got &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot;, and my favorite &quot;One More Night&quot;. The only thing I can think of that's missing is &quot;Don't Lose My Number&quot;. Otherwise this is just what the casual fan would expect. This disc would go great with the collection from &quot;Genesis&quot;, which is also brilliantly titled &quot;The Hits&quot;.
B000000993|5.0|This Cd is tooo good to be explained into words it is just GOOD it captures everything rock should capture these guy's talents are Beyond most musicians out right now and Tool is carving themselves a place in rock n roll history as i type this all in all Awesome CD best songs are Sober, Prison Sex, Intolerance,4, and Undertow
B00002MZ4W|5.0|this cd, along with TIDAL are 2 of my favorite cd's of all time... i won't be long, but i will say this much...GET THE DOUBLE CD DEAL.... IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE CD'S ... YOU ARE LOST IN A WORLD FULL OF LIFELESS MUSIC....
0385336810|3.0|I did like this book for the most part.  I did, however..yearn for Becky Bloomwood instead of Emma.  The ending was a bit too typical for my tastes, but overall, it was an OK book.
B00003CXGG|1.0|Just one question that remained on my mind throughout this horrid film. Who decided that Aaliyah should be put with someone as old as Jet Li? And if he isn't that old he looked way older than Aaliyah. He looked as old as Delroy Lindo. But back to the issue at hand...rating this movie.<br />This film was pathetic. Delroy Lindo, Isiah Washington and of course ( Miss Aaliyah ) were pretty good. They moved the story along. The African-American parts of the story were very interesting. The problem I had with Jet Li's part and the scenes with the Chinese actors bored me because it relied on subtitles. I tolerate subtitles in foreign films but I didn't expect so many in this film. Just because people are Asian, Hollywood acts like they can't speak English? Anyway, the film was supposed to be a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Well it failed miserably. Aaliyah and Jet Li had no chemistry. It was easy to see what he saw in her but I didn't buy Aaliyah falling for Jet Li. I just didn't feel that at all.  Like Dangerous Minds, Romeo Must Die is another case of the movie's soundtrack being ten times better than the film. My advice? Don't watch this and don't dare spend money on this. Aaliyah maybe your thing but even her impressive film debut doesn't push any sparks with this one.  This film had a lot of potential IF they had a stronger male lead. I'm sorry Jet Li wasn't cutting it at all.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|The ironic thing is, it's better than I thought it was going to be-Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly hated this movie, and they have every right to. It has those &quot;I've seen them all before&quot; predictable plotlines, the script was OK, and it was just another Julia Roberts romantic comedy. I'm actually beginning to hate Julia Roberts now because with the exception of Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, Ocean's 11 and Erin Brockovich, she has made really boring movies and she plays the same recycled romantic comedy role every other movie, which is why people liked Erin Brockovich so much. It's not that she's a bad actress, but she doesn't deserve the crowned princess of movies title anymore, either. This movie would have been so much more interesting had it been centered around the students rather than the teacher. This film could have been much better had it been a look at the rebelious time of housewives-to-bes rather than a cheesy look at the teacher who left something behind is a little late at the journey of finding herself and instead leads the students. The only thing that saves me from giving this movie one star is one person: Maggie Gyllenhaal. She is the only good actress in this movie. It's tiring to watch Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, but she didn't stand her own in this movie. And Julia Stiles is another good actress, but she didn't really make her character her own-and I didn't like her fake New England/Brittish accent. Maggie G. made her character very human and likeable asside the fact that she was permiscuous. I hope to see her again in the near future, and I expect to. And Ms. Harden, I would like that Oscar back! She was just so annoying! This makes me want to give her a second Oscar for Mystic River (she was very good, but some of the other nominees were better). Maybe if this female-dominated film wasn't made by a male-dominated crew it would have been better. Maybe if it hadn't had copied the good parts of DEAD POETS SOCIETYand made it bad it would've been better. Maybe if Julia Roberts hadn't recycled her old movie roles and stayed at home with hubby Danny Moder it would have been better. Either way, this movie is not a piece of art.
B00018D44U|3.0|This album is good. I gave it three stars because there is only four songs that I love. Nora Jones is kind like Jazz/Blues (to me). I like this album, but not the firs one. That one I give it to my dad, its one star. I recomend it to buy this album, and I think this review was helpful. (that was just my opinion).
0446530891|4.0|David Baldacci has given his readers another barnburner with his latest book, Split Second.  Secret Service agent Sean King is on the campaign trail with a presidential candidate, when this candidate is assassinated right under Sean's nose.  Although  King isn't the team leader, he takes the blame and ultimately leaves the service and tries to pick up the pieces of his shattered life.  Fast forward eight years.  Rising star Secret Service agent Michelle Maxwell has the presidential candidate she's guarding kidnapped under mysterious circumstances.  Maxwell seeks out King to compare notes, and as they dig, they discover that not only are there many similarities between the two cases, but that they're actually connected.<br />As with most Baldacci books, this one is filled with murder and mayhem, bugs and bombs, and a few kidnappings.  You also suspect that one of the bad guys is working on the inside, but I couldn't figure it out until the person revealed him/herself.  The ride has enough twists and turns to make you carsick, and the plot will keep you guessing until the end.<br />One thing I have noticed about Baldacci as he becomes more prolific, and that is more of the good guys are still alive at the end of the book.  This might make for happier endings and more satisfied readers, but it doesn't make a book more realistic.  Still, this one will keep you at the edge of your seat from start to finish.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The Passion has gone down in history as one of the most successful scores ever.  None others have deserved such treatment.  This score is among the best I've ever heard-passionate, moving, thrilling, amazing, mind blowing, and deeply emotional and powerful.  This is a must have not only for Debney fans (who, by the way, has now just entered into the Composers Hall of Fame because of this soundtrack), not only for movie score collecters, but people in general who just like good music.  My good friend was moved to tears with the tracks 11 and 15, and he is a fan of 50 Cent and Eminem.  The power of this score will truly blow your minds...it is an amazing achievement, with the best tracks being-I can't even finish that statement.  This is one of those rare times when a soundtrack does not have a single bad track (the only weak ones I can think of are the first and eighth tracks, but even then they are stunning).  At any rate, this is wonderful music that truly speaks to you deeply about the Lord, the movie, or life in general.
3257229534|5.0|\\"Der Vorleser\\" braids two themes into one complex novel. Part I narrates the love affair between a clever young man of good family and an uneducated woman twenty years his senior. Somerset Maugham explores the same topic in \\"Of Human Bondage\\", as does J W Goethe in \\"Die Leiden des jungen Werther.\\" Schlink adds his own twist by making Michael only 15-years-old at the start of the affair, two years younger than he tells 36-year-old Hanna and several years younger than he behaves.<br />Michael's youth emphasizes his innocence in the affair, his seduction by an older woman, and allows a light-hearted, romantic introduction: Michael and Hanna bicycling through the German countryside; Michael and Hanna making tender love; Michael reading the classics to an enthralled Hanna.<br />Fast-forward seven years to Part II, when law-student Michael attends a Nazi war crime trial as part of his studies. There is Hanna again: Hannah as a former prison guard at the concentration camp in Krakow; Hanna making the prisoners read classics to her before \\"selecting\\" them for extermination at Auschwitz; Hanna letting prisoners burn to death in a locked church, because \\"otherwise they might have escaped.\\"<br />Schlink lets the action slow as Michael holds a prolonged conversation with himself about the morality of the situation. Should he tell the judges of Hanna's lack of education, not to mention apparent complete lack of human intelligence, as a mitigating factor to lessen her sentence? Was he right to condemn all members of that generation equally, even those who were not actively supportive of the Nazi regime, such as his father? <br />The final section of the trilogy provides a satisfying solution to the paradox, at least as far as Michael is concerned: Hanna nobly enduring her punishment; Hanna painfully teaching herself to read; Hanna educating herself about the role of women as prisoners and guards; Hanna saving her meager pay as \\"restitution.\\" Finally, and most necessary for justice, there is Hanna hanging herself so that she does not become a burden on Michael. <br />Bernhard Schlink has written extensively on the subject of justice and the third Reich. \\"Der Vorleser\\" assumes knowledge of those times, as well as of the conflict between the Nazi and post-Nazi generations in Germany. His unadorned German prose leaves it to the reader to distinguish truth from irony.
B00005JMEW|2.0|A vengeful bride, a murky assasination plot and lots of violence and gore are the key elements in this Quentin Tarantino movie. As ususal, he tells the story in a series of plots which relate to a larger theme. The problem is that at times the plots are not in sequence. This leads to some confusion on the part of the audience. Combine this with the undeveloped background of the characters and the audience is left with too many questions. There is a humorous element in the premise of a bride (unnamed) who is exacting revenge with a Katana sword, sort of like Bride Magazine meets Highlander, but overall it is a silly unbelievable plot with little redeeming value. Some good sword techniques if you are into the Martial Arts though. I understand Volume 2 will be out soon and will explain some of the things which were left out in this version of the story. Maybe someone who sees it will fill me in.
B0000025DV|5.0|I heard Mr. Blue Sky playing on a commercial for a new Jim Carrey movie, and I was immediately hooked by the stellar harmony and driving, upbeat tempo. To my pleasant surprise, the entire album is like that too! 70 minutes of precisely performed power pop, replete with heart melting harmonies, space age extravagance, soaring vocals and an overall symphonic effusion...mind blowing! The Beatles comparisons are deserved, but ELO is not your average, cheap impostor. Their hooks and harmonies may be derived from The Beatles, but coupled with their completely original use of the power-pop-space-rock-orchestra, Out Of The Blue stands out as a remarkably disparate and enjoyable album. For fans of authentic, heartfelt, blissful pop music, this is a must have.
B000099T2L|1.0|This album is one of the worst albums I have ever heard.  This truly shows that people with no talent can make it in the music world.  She is a talent-less artists that truly slipped through the cracks.  How did she make it this far?!  Her non-singing upbeat songs are truly nothing but rambling garbage in flat keys.  She really cannot sing and those of you who think she can are just as tone deaf as she is.  Beyonce talks really fast and rambles in all flat keys.  I don't believe she could hold a note in a bucket if her life depneded on it.  This is a girl who attempts to look cute and gets by.  I put her in a class of bathroom singers far, far away where no one can hear her.  She cannot write music, she cannot read music, and she cannot even sing on key!  Why do you think every thing she sings is in low tones?  She sings flat, that's why!  She does nothing but mumbles throughout the entire CD.  Getting Sean Paul to help...didn't help.  Now, she wants to put out the rest of the music she intended for this album?  Do us all a favor Beyonce...DON'T!  Save the garbage for your own ears, you have tortured us all enough.
0061020710|4.0|...as the later books in the series, but still a must read for any fantasy lover.  The starting of the saga begins here, with the love or hate character Rincewind, to continue in the later books.  It's also one of the only books by Terry Pratchett to use chapters, so don't get accustomed to them.
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman has an easy-to-read writing style.  In this book he claims that we experience one of the five love languages, which is how we best receive love from other individuals.  He calls the languages quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch.  The theory is that we easily give from the language we enjoy receiving the most.  Relationships can get into trouble when one partner gives from his primary love language, but the other partner has a different primary love language and does not receive it as love.  The partner that is giving may feel rejected or like their contribution is not worth much to the other or is unappreciated.  In fact, it's due to the way the two different individuals experience &quot;love&quot;.<br />Gary Chapman does a good job of explaining each of the five types.  Not surprisingly, my husband and I fell into different categories.  It's helped us in two ways:<br />1) to learn to communicate with the other in his or her primary love language,<br />2) to be able to see when the other person is approaching us with his or her primary language<br />I enjoyed this book and it has had a positive impact on my relationship.
0061020680|5.0|Being part of the Death sub series this book is inclined to get good ratings, which it does deserve.  While it's not as complex as the books later in the Discworld, such as The Truth, or Nightwatch, Mort is a good starting book to the series (Even though it isn't actually the first.  Go figure.)
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Comparing Kagemusha with Ran is a thread that runs through many of the reviews. Both are dramas centered around warlords during Japan's feudal era, and were directed by Kurosawa late in his career. Both films are visually stunning, but there are differences in how the stories are presented. Ran seems affected by its self-conscious adaptation of King Lear, and has a more theatrical (and less cinematic) feel about it. The acting is very stylized, as if in adapting Shakespeare's play Kurosawa also wanted to reaffirm the Japanese qualities through similarities to traditional ritualistic Noh dramas.<br />  The story of Kagemusha seems more of a natural portrayal in comparison. The loyalty of the thief to the warlord is perhaps a quintessentially Japanese story, and is beautifully evoked in many small scenes throughout the film. It is the battle scenes which are highly stylized in this film, as they serve to illustrate the changing fortunes of the clans, and are not centerpieces. They are a part of the amazing beauty of the film's images. One of my favorite images of all the films I have seen is that of the warlord's unhappy son plotting in a traditional room, while in the background we can see the blue of a lake being whipped up by a storm.<br />  Some people will prefer Ran, and others will like best Kurosawa's earlier and more earthy films, such as Yojimbo. They are all wonderful, but for myself Kagemusha is his crowning achievement.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|While I don't proclaim the Breakfast Club to be a masterpiece or &quot;the best movie ever&quot; or anything quite as seminal as that, it certainly deserves appreciation for its originality.<br />Here was a film that presents five students who initially come across as cardboard cliches, but who eventually reveal themselves as so much more. The writing is sharp and crisp, and apart from a few patches of overdone juvenile behavior, the dialogue flows seamlessly.<br />Sure, the movie has its warts. Parents are the root of all the kids' problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a somewhat prolonged but inconsequential dance sequence smooshed in.<br />Yet, twenty two years on, the movie still rings as true as ever because school life remains essentially the same -- same sorts of conflict between generations, private fears often undisclosed to the outside world, worries about their futures nagging them, etc etc.<br />A truly enjoyable, clever brat-pack character study. Special highlight -- the popular Simple Minds number &quot;Don't You Forget About Me&quot;.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a down are like dr pepper, you have to try them to like them. Most of my friends say they are crap but i totally disagree. System are one of my favorite bands as they don't stick to the rules and they dont follow political correctness.<br />The music has soul behind it, you can tell this by their desire to entertain and their lyrics, most of the time the lyrics help you relate to the songs and get you thinking.<br />Prison Song - 10/10 Fast paced song, catchy lyrics<BR>Needles - 10/10 Catchy lyrics and wiered chorus<BR>Deer Dance - 10/10 very fast pace and political charged?<BR>Jet Piolet - 7/10 Lyrically substandard<BR>X - 8/10 Talks about Genecide (TOO SHORT, BUT GOOD)<BR>Chop Suey - 10/10 (You've all heard it you know what to expect!)<BR>Bounce - 8/10 Not as good as people say and again too short.<BR>Forest - 10/10 Lyrics like umpa lumpas but generally good.<BR>ATWA - 9/10 Not one of my favourites but nice interlude.<BR>Science - 10/10 Fast paced song and good guitar riffs.<BR>Shimmy - 8/10 Good but probably written under the influence.<BR>Toxicity - 10/10 Best song on the album and not much else to say.<BR>Psycho - 10/10 Very fun and Fast.<BR>Aerials - 10/10 last song, nice way to finish off the album, very good bass line at the beggining.<br />TOTAL: 130/140<br />All of these songs have a degree of variety and none of them sound the same.<br />I would recommend this album to non - conformists, moshers and metal heads. so UP THE SYSTEM ................ and DOWN THE SLIPKNOT who have past it.......... they need new gimmicks / masks
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions. perhaps one of the most unfairly maligned film of the past few years? perhaps the most misunderstood film of the past few years? Certainly, and much more. What we have here is a case I will never understand. First of all, obviously, the special effects are phenomenal, perhaps the greatest ive ever seen this side of LOTR. Its jaw dropping to be frank. The siege of Zion is monstruous and the final showdown is one huge kick that frankly just flat out rocks. Ok now thats out of the way. Let me discuss the main reason I love these 2 sequels so much and why I hold them in the same regard as the original Matrix. The story is in my opinion flat out fantastic. period. you cant have a decent and engrossing science fiction film without a compelling story. and Reloaded and Revolutions delivered that in spades. From the discovery that Neo is but a pawn in the overall scheme of the machines, to the fact that Zion is nothing more than a physical matrix to its inhabitants, these 2 films gave a plot twist so huge in my opinion it ranks up there with the original planet of the apes. Youll have to look at the first film in a whole new light. Many complained that Revolutions did not answer any questions and gave a cop out ending. This is pure and simply FALSE. The answers are there but not explicetly spelled out, The death of smith DOES make sense, Neos powers ARE explained (and possibly reference earlier in Reloaded) and the ending is in no way a copout and has been forshadowed since the animatrix. In Revolutions they make theire point that despite the differences, both man and machine deserve theire life and forshadow the conclusion. Peace is the only solution. I will say I was a little dissapointed that the character of the merovingian was not fleshed out more but thats about it in terms of problems with the overall plot. Overall the film is very well done, the Score by Don Davis is fantastic and SHOULD have at least been nominated for an Oscar. The script isprobably the weakest of the three films, I have to admit if only for the inclusion of several \\"cheesy\\" lines and a drawn out death scene, which despite that still works well. The acting is what youd expect from the films, on the same level as the first two movies, though keanu Reeves does a decent job outside his usual unsure personality routine which is pretty much what Neo is. Hugo Weaving as always is excellent. He delivers some particularly good stuff here including a great exchange with the oracle and a tremendous final monologue. Special mention to Ian Bliss who played Bane who did a great job of playing the real world Smith. Totally surprised me.  Anyways, like I said, this movie does not deserve the harsh reviews it got last year, and many reviewers are now pointing that out. But hey lets remember many sci fi classics were maligned themselves, for example, Blade Runner....<br />In the end all I can say is watch all 3 films. Get rid of any preconceived notions, forget the ridiculous hype just watch all 3 films and appreciate what the Wachowski brothers have done. The first truly exceptional science fiction trilogy of our time. Lucas dreamed it, but these guys actually did it and much much more. Take it from a huge science fiction fan and as a film fan. These movies deserve theire place as one of the great sagas.<br />4 1/2 stars
B00005JN1L|2.0|I saw the personality problem coming a mile away. How many times are we going to do this story? I bet you this would have been a great read but the movie was predictable. Johnny Depp was awesome as usual of course.

B00005JMEW|1.0|I got this movie becasue I liked Quentin Taratino's previous success in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  This is nothing like it and does not show the same inventive flow.  It is cartoonish, dull, not exciting, boring, full of insipid and umemotional violence and generally not worth wasting time and money to see.<BR>I am glad I saw this, however, so I won't waste time and money on KB2.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Identity is a wonderful movie, a dark melodrama with more twists and turns than a corkscrew. If anyone you know tries to tell you the secret of what's REALLY happening in this film, or how it ends, before you see the  movie....kill them. Because they're robbing you of one of the most genuinely enjoyable viewing experiences, and truly shocking shock endings, you'll ever see.

B0000640VN|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever.  Hugh Jackman does a terrific job portraying an english duke from back in time.  I love his manners that are used.  I had a dream last night in which I was going to marry Leopold (the main character), and he was extremely nice and the way every man should be. lol.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|I was wrong about this ppv. It wasn't that great. i missed hulk hogan being there it would of made wrestlemania better and the only great match was the triple threat match Chris Beniot vs Shawn Michaels vs Triple hh for the world heavyweight title and i thought the angle vs eddie would be a lot better.
038572179X|2.0|Though I agree with many other reviewers that Atonement displays McEwan's talent for crafting beautiful sentences, I was terribly disappointed that such language was wasted on a slow, boring plot and completely empty, one-sided characters that I never got to know.  <BR>In the beginning I had to keep flipping back to try to remember who was who as he intoduced several of the book's characters without providing the reader any features with which to distinguish them.<BR>After somewhat monotonous descriptions that, while providing some insight into setting, provided very little into the mind and heart of the charcters, I was so grateful when ONE somewhat interesting event finally occured.  But my excitement that there was some sort of action vanished when, after MANY more pages, it became clear that this one event would encompass the entire plot.  <BR>The characters remained completely one-sided.  Each pretty much had one fault and/or one virtue.  <BR>The book focuses on a girl's transition from youth through adolescence and into old age, but I was unconvinced that this was how such a character would behave in these stages of life.  Because her emotions and reactions were so odd, it was too difficult to identify with her on any level, and the transitions were unmoving.  <BR>The middle section describing the horrors of Dunkirk was an exception to the overall sense of stagnation the book inspired, and I appreciated the historical accuracy and details.  Though this part also got somewhat monotonous at time, overall it was one of the few times the book evoked real feeling and presented a complete enough picture of what was going on to allow the reader to actually become involved in the event.    <BR>The end was disappointingly sappy and trite.  I would have liked to hear more about Briony's internal struggle and why she chose to lie again about what happened to Cecilia and Robbie and less about the family reunion.    <BR>I think that the concept of the book as Briony's lifelong effort at atonement was awesome, but the book lost me so many times that I just didn't care that much by the end.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is the movie/martialart/scifi/comicbook -nerd's dreamflick. There are more &quot;hidden&quot; jokes on movies, series and comics of the 50-80's than any one person can identify! My guess is that those who didn't like this flick didn't know or notice those and took this movie &quot;as is&quot;. It is not good &quot;as is&quot;, that is the point. It is an homage to bad class B flicks that the teenage nerds used to love. Now that we are in our thirties, we love to see all that silly stuff remembered in this flick. And we love to see how many different sources we can catch during the film! Everything from cartoons to Star Trek to Babylon 5 to Bruce Lee to Kato/Green Hornet to spaghetti westerns to Battle Royale to simple cheap action movies that only young teenagers like... All the fantasies of a movie/comic/scifi/kungfu fanaticnerdteenager are paid homage in Kill Bill.
0380002930|5.0|You would think that a book about rabbits would be simple and boring, right?  WRONG!!!!  This book tells the tale of a group of rabbits who are forced to leave their burrow because a farm is going to be built there.  It is the exiting, tragic tale of friendship and the terrors of of rural life as seen by a rabbit.  What makes it even more believable is that the various dangers, such as snares and train tracks, are described as how they would be by someone or something who finds the idea incomprehensible.  This touching tale is more than just that, though.  I also think it is a commentary on how nature has been affected by development.  A must read.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I liked this movie. The plot is quite standard for a &quot;romance&quot; movie: two adults are in bad marriages on their own, get attracted to each other and try to figure their way about it. The tiny twist here comes from the huge age difference between the characters. It stops them from really developing a romance, they never get into sack as the old guy wouldn't know what the young girl would think of him if he even tried. So they end up enjoying each others' company in platonic manner and they seem to wander half-lost without knowing what to do. The audience sees the couple enjoy spending time with each other but also realise it is nigh-on impossible for them to split from their unsatisfying marriages to really get together... Yet, they long each others' company and don't know what to do about it. The slow suspence comes from trying to guess how they'll solve their lives and relationships. Could it happen?

1401300901|4.0|Many have described the book content... what I would like to let you know is that this book, although (as you might have read here elsewhere) may be a little amateurish at times regarding the writing, is one of the best stories I've ever read (and I read quite a bit).<br />Not only does it remind you of what life is all about, how life should be lived, how much people around us are worth, and how pre-judging someone could be one of our biggest mistakes in life... but it portrays it in a common, every-day kind of way that will keep your mind coming back to the book even after days of having finished it. The way the plot wraps around you (both intellectually and emotionally), touching and reflecting in many aspects of your own life, may be surprising and at the same time insightful.<br />I would recommend this read to anyone... it teaches in a beautiful way just how much personal independence, self respect, and the love of oneself-as-one-is permit us to love and be loved fully.
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park doesn't have much going for them in terms of standing out from the rap-metal pack. Okay, in a way, they do perhaps. They have good taste in indie hip-hop (Kut Masta Kurt, Aceyalone, etc.), and they have a better grasp on melody than, say, Limp Bizkit. But still, weak lyrics, tired sub-Faith No More riffing, and a pretty absent reliance on hip-hop does not a good album make. Linkin Park seem like nice enough guys, and their intentions seem better than (...)Fred Durst and Scott Stapp. Their music, however, just doesn't move me in any way and ends up passing itself off as a Korn imitation only much less vulgar. Nice try, guys.
0679735909|5.0|A.S. Byatt is one of my favorite authors. She is definitely an author for literate people, although a book like Possession can be enjoyed by anyone. Anyone who loves literature can identify with the characters and their stories. <br />Roland Michel and Maud Bailey are both literary scholars and both have their &quot;pet authors&quot; whom they are studying and trying to fill in the blanks of the lives of. Roland is studying Randolph Ash, whose letters he has, while Mott has the diaries of Christabel LaMotte. Both are Victorian poet, and Byatt does a wonderful job creating their works in such a way, that you could swore you read their poems as part of your English survey classes. <br />The love story is the driving force of this book, yet the part of the story that hits home for me is the strange obsession with discovering the inner workings of poets and authors. I understand it, because when you really love a certain poem or other work, it is because it means something specific to you. But after you have derived your own satisfaction from your own meaning of the poem, it is suddenly replaced by a desire to know what the author REALLY MEANT when he or she wrote what they did. <br />The chance to delve into the author's life and find out their secrets, find out exactly what circumstances are behind what they have written is irresistable, but at the same time, once the knowledge is discovered, it comes with the realization that you have looked at parts of someone's life that they didn't want anyone to look at. <br />The very secretiveness and tragedy of the relationship between the two poets makes it vivid and interesting and some reviews point out that the relationship of Roland and Maud is stiff and dull by comparison. But I think that is purposeful. Roland and Maud are not poets, they are scholars. They are trapped in a world of repression and disappointment and dullness and because of that, even the smallest step toward passion means volumes more than it appears. <br />This book can be enjoyed on many levels and if you like it, I urge to read more of the author's work.
B000060P79|1.0|Oh punk rock, where have you gone? I was subjected to this album last year by a friend, and needless to say, I wasn't pleased. It's sad that punk rock, once a vital and powerful artform, has been co-opted and watered down into sort-of a sub-power pop, \\"alternative\\" rock mashup for a new generation. Simple Plan are to the Ramones (or even Green Day for that matter) what Candlebox was to Nirvana. No Pads, No Helmets...No Talent (eerr, No Balls) is a bland collection of Deep Blue Something tunes played at 45 rpm and dressed with a hodge-podge of laughably trite lyrics written by a 20-something about how hard it is to be 16. Not that there's anything wrong with writing a song about your teenaged years, but Simple Plan completely trivializes the experience of growing up (if you want a good song about being young, try The Replacements' \\"Sixteen Blue\\"). It's downright insipid. It's not even about the music being punk (it's not punk though); any way you slice it, this is bad stuff. It's the kind of music that insists that rebellion is about telling your parents to f' off because they want you to do the dishes. It's sad really, that a genre that used to base itself on rejecting conformity (musically, politically, etc.) has become pre-packaged drivel that goes against all the values it used to stand for. Not that it's Simple Plan's fault that they're marketed as punk, but the fact that it is passed-off as such is a tad disheartening. I could go into a long rant here, and I don't want to. If you like this sort-of thing, fine, but I think it pretty much speaks for itself. If you have any interest in punk rock at all, though, pick up a record by the Ramones, The Clash, or The Fall.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Yeah, hi.  I loved Kill Bill.  I also love KB2.  The only problem with KB2?  Not enough action.  And no fight scenes with David Carradine.  But hey, other than that Kill Bill is flawless.  I would have liked to have seen the anime sequence done with real actors though.  And I would have liked more of Michael Madsen.<br />I am thrilled that David Carradine starred in this.  He looks incredile for a cat his age.  He is pure evil.  One of the best movie bad guys ever!  And this is QT's BEST movie ever!  I can't wait for KB3!  And if you are a QT and Elvis fan check out the new film called HEY DJ at [...]<br />I saw the film HEY DJ it and it looks cool, fun, and quirky.  A great little movie.  It reminded me of Tarantino's work and his being a big time Elvis fan.  I think Madsen has a little Elvis in his performance in KB1 &amp; 2!
B00000G3PA|4.0|What would you do if you knew that tomorrow the world was going to come to an end? Who would you talk to? What would you accomplish or attempt to accomplish before the end was to come? Where would you place yourself as you waited for that fateful moment to arrive? These are the questions that are constantly ignored within disasters films throughout the history of cinema and most recently in the latest surge of disaster flicks that have ranged from erupting volcanoes to catastrophic natural disasters to world-ending cosmic forces such as asteroids and comets colliding with Earth, thus ending all life on this planet. 1998 was a classic year in which two disaster films faced off against each other within a two month time span dealing with the same basic plot line (space-rock colliding with Earth while a space team tries to prevent such a disaster from occurring) but selling each one in a decidedly different style and audience base. The first was Deep Impact (Dreamworks) which rushed out of the gate with $40 million in its opening weekend but failed to show legs by ending its run with $140 million. Less then two months later, Jerry Bruckheimer set to conquer space with his action-drama, Armageddon, and show how these disasters flicks are to be done correctly.<br />The story centers around the rag-tag team of \\"astronauts\\" that are sent into space to divert a space rock from colliding with Earth, which, in result, would end most life on the planet, if not all. It seems like any other day in New York City ... That is before large explosions occur throughout the city destroying office buildings and towering structures and resulting in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals. The United States Government, believing this to be an attack of terrorism, asks NASA to discover the source of the problem but when they do, they get a decisively different answer then they had ever anticipated. What caused the explosions in New York weren't missiles ... they were smallmeteorites (about the size of basketballs) that trailed off the enormous asteroid (about the size of Texas) that is on a direct collision course with Earth. With only about two weeks until the asteroid is estimated to hit, NASA brings aboard Harry Stamper, the best deep core driller on the planet, to train astronauts to drill into the asteroid, drop a nuclear device, blow apart the asteroid, and divert the two pieces from colliding with Earth. Claiming he is only the best because he works with the best, Harry forces NASA to recruit his rag-tag team of drillers to fly into space and save the world. But that is easier said then done as they not only face difficulties in the training program but unforeseen tricks that the asteroid throws at the \\"astronauts\\" in their attempt to accomplish the task at hand. The story for Armageddon, as outlandish and over-the-top as it may be, works exceedingly well in presenting a combination of fast-paced action sequences, sarcastic and, at times, irreverent humor, and dialed in emotions, even if they may be over played in several moments within the course of the film.<br />One of the great things that Jerry Bruckheimer films are known for, outside of the well-choreographed explosive action sequences, are his talented group of actors that are brilliantly cast in their roles. And Armageddon once again proves the truth of that statement, despite a few performances here and there that apply to the contrary. Bruce Willis, in the same genre that basically defined him as a key actor in Hollywood, takes center stage in almost every action sequence he's featured in and fills the screen with his sarcastic-toned humor and gritty, rock-solid attitude that works extraordinarily well with his character. Despite this being one of his few major release performances, Billy Bob Thornton still manages to give an excellent performance as the director of NASA who coordinates the mission to save the planet. Though his character isn't featured as much as the others, Thornton still realizes he is a centralized character and the emotions he expresses in his scenes will be needed to reflect the actions that are occurring or will occur later in the feature. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler are perfect together as the film's romantic couple, though at times Affleck's performance was a tad on the wooden side, of which his acting ability has often been described by critics, but this time that being so only when he was asked to cry and near the end of the film when everyone, not just Affleck, seemed to wind down as the feature wrapped up. And another note ... Never let Affleck sing in a film ever again. Singing is definitely not his strongest talent and he proves that so in this film. And the most notable and worthy highlight of the cast has to be the marvelous, facetious and humorous performance given by Steve Buscemi, who has yet to portray a role that doesn't work for him in the least.<br />Overall, whatever quips you have with Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay or the disaster genre in general, Armageddon is decisively one of the best action flicks in years and raises the bar for all others like to follow in its footsteps. Though his films are famous for their outlandish action sequences, the combative scenes in this film go beyond the normal expectation ten-times in that their choreography and set up transcend the amazing special effects that are used to execute the sequence. Though there are many things to compliment the filmmakers on in this film, the feature is far from perfect but not so much so that it is an utterly unbearable disaster (no pun intended). At times the situations involved are too unbelievable and far-fetched, though it to be suggested that they may not have been intended to taken seriously in the first place, that it takes away some of the film's credibility. It would have been better if the situations were more down-to-earth (once again, no pun intended) for the audience to take the plot of the film more seriously. And, yes, several moments in the feature are over-drawn and clichéd but with the overall tone of the film being quite entertaining, one can forgive the filmmakers for such mistakes. Clearly if you don't enjoy action films or can bother leaving your head at the door (not entirely but for portions of the film) then Armageddon isn't for you but Bruckheimer flicks have the weird effect of making the most unlikely people fans of his work, so give it a shot before passing judgment.

B00008LOS1|5.0|It's one of the greatest achievements in the history of rock. Still, more than enough has been said about the original album so I'm going to leave it alone. The real gem here is the Young Vic set. This one proves beyond any doubt that Live at Leeds was no fluke. It's also a completely different kind of set. The extended jamming that characterized the Leeds performance is largely absent here. Most of the material presented was new (eleven of fourteen tracks in fact) and still being shaped. About the only exceptions are &quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, and &quot;Naked Eye&quot;. Ironically, none of those songs made it to the original finished album even though they'd been part of the band's live set for over a year. The only new song that made the cut that's presented in it's finished form is &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;.<br />What comes out is a brilliant set, one that still sounds fresh even though it was recorded more than thirty years ago. The only thing better than the material is the band's performance. These men had played together a couple hundred nights a year for several years at this point and it shows. What's going on between them is virtually telepathy. Listen to the interplay between Moon and Townshend during the instrumental finish of &quot;My Generation&quot;; they echo each other completely. This is also the best live version of &quot;My Generation&quot; on record. It matches the Leeds set for power but is short, tight and concise. In short, it rocks! Then there's the rarities. Many of these songs have only rarely been played live. It's a shame because the material is great. &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; is one of Townshend's finest songs. That one still captivates new listeners. The set opens with a brilliant (and raw) rendition of &quot;Love Ain't for Keeping&quot;.  &quot;Time is Passing&quot; is a neglected jewel. This version is also completely drum driven. Mad magnificent Moonie may have kept everyone around him on the verge of group heart failure but he was an absolute genius on his instrument. Keith cued all the changes the way drummers are supposed to but he also did something no drummer has done, before or since; he played the vocal line on his kit. His work here will have listeners alternately shaking their heads and laughing. It shouldn't make any sense. Instead, it makes nothing but sense. It's no wonder it took almost twenty years to find anyone who could even begin to fill his seat. The energy in this set is astonishing. Daltrey is right in his prime, and is fabulous. He does sing himself hoarse though. That shows when he croaks his way through the last bits of &quot;Too Much of Anything&quot;. Ribbit. That's not a criticism though. It just shows how much fire thes guys played with. The sound is great. Entwistle's bass lines are dominant in a way that he never could be in the studio. On recordings he had to leave room for overdubs. On stage he had to fill those spaces. The more you listen the more you see that he was the glue that held all this together. Without him Townshend and Moon couldn't have run amok the way they used to. You can hear them too, including all of Moon's screeches before his drum flurries. Like I said, this this thing should have anyone listening, shaking their head, laughing and just dropping their jaw in amazement.<br />The Who were an astounding band and pure magic on stage. This set goes a long way toward showing why.of group heart failure but he was an absolute genius on his instrument.

B00007AJF8|3.0|I purchased this film with high hopes, being an aficionado of off-kilter movies.  And with a plot like Being John Malkovich's, how could I go wrong?  A downtrodden puppeteer, working on floor seven and half of an office building, discovers a portal into the mind of John Malkovich.  Even with such an intriguing premise, though, I felt this movie struck out (I am in the minority in feeling this).<br />Let me first say that all of the primary actors performed brilliantly.  Cusack played both the melancholy and crazy sides of Craig the puppeteer quite well, and Diaz really shone as his quirky wife.  One of the best performances was by Malkovich himself, lampooning himself quite handily and playing the different \\"inhabitants\\" of his body as adroitly as he played his own self.<br />However, even these brilliant performances don't save the movie.  Fantasy is a difficult genre to conduct successfully, contrary to popular belief.  One of the unwritten rules of fantasy is that, no matter how fantastical the story, it needs to be internally consistent.  The film fails miserably in this aspect.  Sometimes only a single person can inhabit Malkovich, sometimes multiple people.  Far-fetched explanations about the subconscious and the \\"power of the puppeteer\\" attempt to account for this discrepancy but ultimately prove insufficient, if you follow them through to their logical conclusions.  The writer also throws in several random occurrences with no apparent connection to the idea of the portal.  Why, for instance, does Malkovich end up in a world full of people who look like him when he goes through the portal?  Is this some play on his ego?  On the nature of how we see the world?  I really don't know, and I don't think these inconsistencies were meant to be \\"things to make you go hmm,\\" as in other films.<br />And I suppose that's really what really bothered about Being John Makovich.  The idea is a fascinating one, brilliant even, with so much potential.  But that potential is squandered for cheap laughs: a lesbian affair through Malkovich's body, chimpanzee childhood traumas, lecherous old men, etc.  Instead of harnessing the inherent ironic humor in the idea and making this a thought-provoking movie, the writers used the idea to string together several cheesy laughs characteristic of other Hollywood comedies.<br />As it is, I give Malkovich a star for good acting and another star for a nice idea.  For a real five-star, absurd, ironic, and absolutely fascinating comedy, I recommend Fight Club.

Though based on the character \\"the Bride\\", I felt the film was truly original.  The film is great, and I admire the sarcasm and creativity of Tarantino. He's a genious, and you can't deny that, when he makes a film as brilliant as Kill Bill Volume One after making masterpieces like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Great twists and turns, action, and soundtrack.

B000089RVX|5.0|Ahhh, it's always fun to sit back and watch the debate between the mainstream crowd that is afraid to find new music outside of the radio dial and the outsiders who sit back and just laugh at everything popular.  Note: if you belong to either of these two groups, you're missing out on lots of good music!<br />That comment aside, I really couldn't care less how popular Evanescence is.  What I do care is that I bought the Daredevil Soundtrack, mainly for the Fuel song &quot;Won't Back Down,&quot; and first heard this band there.  The first time I heard &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; I was thoroughly impressed, and I don't often have such positive reactions to songs I'm hearing for the first time.  Also, I heard this song just BEFORE the Evanescence craze swept the nation, so at the time, they were a band I'd never heard of.<br />Anyway, I bought the disc shortly after hearing that song.  I was definitely not disappointed.  Right when I turned on the disc and heard &quot;Going Under,&quot; I had a feeling this was something special.  My only question was whether the whole disc was more nu-metal Goth rock like &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; or more ballady like &quot;My Immortal,&quot; since both songs are on the Daredevil Soundtrack.  Well, it's a rock album.  &quot;Hello&quot; is the only other ballad, which is admittedly just a weaker version of &quot;My Immortal.&quot;  The rest of the album just flat out rocks.<br />&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; is another one of my faves, but the biggest gem besides &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is &quot;Imaginary.&quot;  Someone actually figured out how to take a violin-heavy orchestra sound and make it rock, creating a very different-sounding song that almost seems too original for any dumbed-down masses to enjoy.<br />Comparisons to Linkin Park and Lacuna Coil are both accurate.  This band is, in many ways, a cross between the two.  But that's not a bad thing--those are two excellent bands.  And what do you know, one of those bandsis popular, the other isn't.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is a good CD and is for any nirvana fan. The people who wrote the other reviews dont know what their talking about. Good music,mabie not as good as JIMMI, but u cant expect everyone to be perfect and live up to his guitarist standers.
B00005B36H|2.0|OK, so I'm clearly not the world's biggest Tool fan.  That said, I do like most of their music from the previous albums.  I've never bowed down and worshipped at the mighty altar of Tool as so many people do, but I do think they're an above-average band.<br />Lots of people are quick to point out that Tool is &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;different,&quot; and more musically talented than most nu-metal bands out there.  I tend to agree with most of that, but this is album is not really the best reflection of that.<br />First off, I have a problem with the trend started on Aenima of wasting time and space with several pointless filler tracks.  What purpose was ever served by tracks like &quot;Useful Idiot,&quot; &quot;Cesaro Summability,&quot; or &quot;(-) Ions?&quot;  There's more of the same here, with &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse,&quot; &quot;Mantra,&quot; and others.  Between those and excessively long tracks with few or no vocals like &quot;Triad&quot; and &quot;Disposition,&quot; I couldn't help but think that out of 13 tracks, I was really only getting about 6 or 7 actual songs.<br />I guess since you're only getting 6 or 7 songs, they must have decided that each one has to be at least 7 minutes long to make you feel like you got your money's worth.  Well, I think it was a much better idea to have 10 songs at about 5 or 6 minutes apiece like they did on Undertow.  I think 5 minutes is plenty of time to make a song musically diverse and creative; apparently they no longer agree.<br />I'm sure your local radio station has played &quot;Schism,&quot; &quot;Parabola,&quot; and a much, much shorter version of the otherwise-nine-minute-long title track a few thousand times each.  Those tracks are all good, but as far as I'm concerned, those are really the only songs you need to know from this effort.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Even in 2004, I am constantly finding more great films from 2003.  This movie is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen.  Everything is unpredictable and that is rare in films today.  Halle Berry is an awesome actress and she plays the insane role really good.  Penelope Cruz also surprised me, in playing a psychotic rape victim.  This film really grabbed me and never let go until the end.  It is as if you took Steven King, and then blended it with a little Alfred Hitchcock.  I highly recommend this film for thrill fans as well as people who love Halle Berry.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Let me start off by saying that there are hundreds of CD's I've heard that I could write a review about, but I chose this as one of my few to talk about, because a) this is an extremely popular band and b) I don't want to be like a lot of people who only write reviews for albums that they really love and give 5 stars to (or albums they really hate and give 1 star to).  This album is neither.  I don't love it, I don't hate it, I just think it's pretty good.  3.5 stars is what I'd really give this album, but I didn't have that option.<br />Basically, the rating of 3.5 stars is about what I would have expected to give it, because it combines Soundgarden, who I've always liked, with Rage Against the Machine, who I've never liked.  Certainly you would expect to hear influences from each of those bands melded into one, and that's pretty much what you get.<br />If by some strange chance you don't know much about this band, let me make it easy for you--take Rage Against the Machine, subtract the annoying political rap from Zack de la Rocha, and add the familiar grunge-rock vocals of Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, and mix in some touches of Soundgarden's music as well.<br />Breaking it down a little farther, I will say this--I never liked anything about Rage--the music or the vocals.  Although it is definitely different, I have often found guitar player Tom Morello's style to be annoying.  There are definitely some moments of that on this album, such as the solo in &quot;Bring 'em Back Alive.&quot;  Fortunately, throughout the majority of the album, Morello does find a way to temper his guitar playing such that he maintains his distinct style WITHOUT being annoying, which I found to be a pleasant surprise.<br />The first five songs on the album are all singles, and are generally the best tracks on this disc.  The album tapers off in the second half, with only a few real highlights after &quot;I Am the Highway.&quot;<br />The bottom line?  If you liked Soundgarden, you'll likeAudioslave.  If you liked Rage, you'll like Audioslave.  If you liked both, you'll love Audioslave.  If you didn't like either band, why are you wasting your time reading this review?
B000067J1H|4.0|In a world where the underdog never expresses themselves or the fury they mask. In this brilliant film, a collection of low class losers become so powerful, they in literally bring cooperate America down to it's knees.  Fight club is a witty, humorous inventive film that captivates the mind, as well as the freedom that total release brings, along with slow deterioration and pointlessness an aimless life will bring.  <br />Brad Pitt delivers a comical and raw role as a free spirit intent on exposing the true horror and misdirection this material world brings.  He loves to move place to place, and to mutilate the body, to invoke a state of complete freedom and valance.  He despises the `things' such as jewelry, entertainment devices, and the economics of the current first world countries.  He in fact shows the true irony and stupidity of the wealthy when he sells rich overweight woman their own fat back to them in the form of expensive deodorant soap.<br /> Edward Norton plays the middle class hard working man, doing duty cover-ups for a deceptive car company.  When he tries to find meaning in a variety of support groups, which in turn make him feel the pain of others to mask his own empty life.  Then he finds another woman has the same idea, and that is when he begins to lose his new found solution.  After a series of business trips, he finds a witty friend and finds that he is his new best friend.  <br />After at a traumatic event, he realizes that fighting is a strangely releasing thing, and that he loses all of his fear and doubt about the future.  As the fight club grows, Edward finds that he is no longer holding such a close on his friend, as Brad begins to have an affair with his old suicidal friend. Eventually, the group spirals out of control, as does Pitt, when death exposes the group for the dangerous cult it is. <br /> It is then when Pitt disappear and seemingly starts more destructive groups in other cities when Edward Norton finds out that the battle against this insanity literally lays within his own mind.  <br />Though I did not like the twist in this movie, the ending was still satisfying, though while I was blown away by the nerve, wit, and humor during 80% of the movie.  The dialoge was absolutely intelligent and witty. This movie is absolutely excellent, a psychological masterpiece, and a joy for any movie lover.
B00008H2LB|4.0|4 stars might be lower than what I really think, but I can't give it the full five, because I don't like it quite as much as Hybrid Theory.  That said, I'd like to do something some people seem to have a lot of trouble doing here--completely ignore how popular this band is and just review the disc on its own merits.  I neither condemn nor credit a band simply for becoming mainstream.  And I highly oppose award shows like the Grammys that pretty much use record sales to determine who wins awards for best music--I don't need consensus or mainstream opinion to tell me what's good--I can figure that out myself.  You should be able to do the same.<br />For anyone who says that every song on this disc sounds the same and sounds exactly like the songs on Hybrid Theory, sorry, I disagree.  Yes, there are SOME songs that are like that; for example, &quot;Easier to Run&quot; is basically &quot;Crawling&quot;, Part 2.  &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; bear quite a bit of resemblance to each other.  But I don't know any song on either album that sounds anything like &quot;Nobody's Listening,&quot; for example.  I have to give them some real credit on that one--I normally dislike straight rap (as opposed to rap-rock), but the Japanese pan flute really makes this song stand out as being very unique, and actually rather enjoyable.  Otherwise, &quot;Don't Stay&quot; is a great rocker to open the disc, &quot;Numb&quot; is a mid-tempo song that closes out the album on a high note and became one of my faves well before it got radio play, and &quot;Figure.09&quot; is probably the best song on the disc.<br />With songs like &quot;Somewhere I Belong,&quot; &quot;Numb,&quot; &quot;Faint,&quot; and &quot;Lying From You,&quot; try to get past the fact that your local radio station plays them 30 times a day, and just listen to the songs on their own merit.  Turn off the radio if it bothers you that much--I do.  You might find that you like the songs more than you think but you're just sick of hearing them.  And most importantly, if you want to criticize LP (or any other band), do it because you don't like the music, not because they've caught on with the mainstream crowd.

B000002MTU|5.0|To have this album released was a big relief for Clapton fans, after the garbage the former guitar god had been putting out for more than 10 years. It was about time the man who had got to wear Armani (Very weird for a so called blues lover) would release an all blues cd, and he sure got it right. <br />I must confess I have not heard all the songs by their original composers, but the versions included here are stunning. The decision of recording the songs with no overdubs was a wise one. The music sounds fresh and strong. The playing is flawless and the esence of the blues comes across in every note.<br />Kinda hard to point out highlights since they all are, but my personal faves would be Third Degree, How Long, Blues Leave Me Alone, Sinner's Prayer, Motherless Child and It Hurts Me Too.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Firstly:<BR>This is a movie that gets better every time you watch it. Chances are, if you didn't understand this movie, you are stupid [no offense]. I only say this because so many people complain about it being too confusing and random. Perhaps these people never took basic philosophy or even English courses that would help them catch the important clues.<BR>Another complaint that I noticed is that this movie was slow. A lot of people say that. I suppose that they were expecting this to be an Action/Horror sci-fi instead of an intellectual one. Sorry folks: This movie is for thinkin' people and not for the average public-schooled American.<br />Here's are some tips:<BR>-If you don't get the movie, watch it again. Like Fight Club, this tip could help you understand it a lot better so as you can appreciate what's going on.<BR>-If you think it's too slow, stop watching it. You obviously can't handle the movie or any of its messages. The best thing to do is to quickly eject the DVD and replace it with &quot;Predator II&quot;, which I am sure is more to your liking.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first heard this CD when it came out and was overly impressed with No Such Thing, Your Body Is A Wonderland and Back To You. Most of the other tracks I would skip over. For some reason one night I just put the CD in and I started to listen to all the songs and well the rest is history! Listening to the guitar on this CD is enough for me to give it 4/5, the vocals and lyrics make it one of the best CDs I own. I'd highly recommend this CD to anybody.
048622709X|4.0|This is a superb little book to have around the studio at all times. Although there are one or two better books on the subject of drawing this most difficult of body parts (Burne Hogarth's 'Drawing Dynamic Hands' is the best), there is nothing to match this one for sheer value for money.<br />While Bridgman's illustrations are a little sketchy for my taste, you can't beat the sheer convenience of having a book containing one hundred different hand positions around when you need a quick reference for a particular hand position...and all for under eight dollars. What more do you want? A chocolate cover?<br />Great illustrations, good, informative text, a handy size, and great value for money. What are you waiting for?<br />Buy this book now!
038572179X|1.0|This book was a waste of my time.  I've never written a review here before, but I feel the need to warn you all.  I don't know why people were slobbering all over themselves to hype this book, but don't believe a word of it.  It never connected with me at all.  None of the characters were believable, and none earned my sympathy.  The inner dialogues were confusing and seemed a bit off, at best.  In a book in which only 1 thing really happens, this dialogue is the most important part of the book and must be executed flawlessly.  <BR>Joyce and Proust are confusing at times, but also succeed wonderfully at capturing this inner life that we all lead.  And this success is what creates the connection between the reader and the books that those authors wrote.  McEwan, in my opinion, tried in many places to achieve a similar result.  <BR>Unfortunately, there is no connection with the reader.  The actions the main characters take seem without any reason, and without any recognizable motive - and this seems a failure rather than a point McEwan is trying to make.  This failure is magnified by dialogue that is forced and seems pointless.  While I respect his high ambitions, in this case it ends in spectacular failure.  His failure to connect results in an apathy that I have not felt in reading a book for some time.  <BR>For those of you who insist on reading the book, read up until the incident where Cecilia jumps into the fountain.  McEwan never makes the reader care about that vase, never makes the reader care about Cecilia, and never makes the reader care about Robbie.  The whole scene, much like the book as a whole, just never rings true.  People don't act, think, or talk as Mr. McEwan describes and his book fails as a result.
B000002UDB|5.0|While many argue that this album is subpar because it lacks a singular vision of Sgt Pepper (whose theme isn't that strong anyway, especially compared to, say, &quot;Dark Side&quot;), it serves another purpose. MMT is a great snapshot of the Beatles at their most psychedelic, and it's a nice, eclectic semi-&quot;greatest hits&quot; package that doesn't repeat songs from their other albums. The only downside is only one George Harrison song, making it the second album in a row he's under-utilized. It also would be nice to have the four Yellow Submarine tracks on here, as they have a similar feel to that of most of this album. The songs:<br />1. Magical Mystery Tour- a good intro to the album, though by itself is a little overrated. 8/10<br />2. Fool on the Hill- Haven't we all felt a little like this? Good McCartney ballad. 9/10<br />3. Flying- A cool, psychedelic instrumental that feels like it should've been extended. Segues nicely into the next track. 7/10 (for its length).<br />4. Blue Jay Way- Why does everyone hate this song? Geoge Harrison's only contribution is a highlight- spacy, haunting, catchy. Maybe you just have to see it in the movie... 10/10<br />5. Your Mother Should Know- Music-hall McCartney in the vein of &quot;Honey Pie&quot; and &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four.&quot; Will be stuck in your head for days. 9/10<br />6. I Am the Walrus- What is there to say that hasn't been said? Insane lyrics, catchy melody, surreal soundscape of noise: John Lennon at his best. 10/10<br />7. Hello Goodbye- Overrated. Decent melody marred by banal lyrics. Paul, leave psychedelia to John and George. 7/10<br />8. Strawberry Fields Forever- &quot;Living is easy with eyes closed/Misunderstanding all you see.&quot; So true... 10/10<br />9. Penny Lane- Very vivid story song. Extremely catchy. 10/10<br />10. Baby You're a Rich Man- Said to be a tribute to their one-time manager, Brian Epstein. Decent song, kind of gets lost among the other greats.  8/10<br />11. All You Need IsLove- From the opening snippet of the Marsailles, to the simple message, great way to close the album. 10/10<br />In summation: Great album, definitely worth the money. Make it your 4th or 5th Beatles purchase (behind Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, Revolver, and maybe Rubber Soul).
B00003CXTG|5.0|For those of you who only give this movie one star and say its inaccurate, maybe you should do some research yourself.  Did you know that the characters Danny and Rafe, represented represented airment in real life, Taylor and Welsh, who also shot down six planes?  When Evelyn used panty hose as a turniqette, surgeons in realife had to use torn sheets as masks when they ran out of supplies!?  What about &quot;Dori&quot; Miller played by Cuba Gooding Jr, the first black service man to shoot a gun and knock down a plane.  What about realife Roger S. Moran, who resembled the red headed character with the speech problem, who tried to wake his fellow officers TWICE the morning they were hit!?  There are many more to choose from, but take you pic and do some research...while this movie does have a love triangle to pull veiwers in and get them to empathize with someone else, it is historically accurate.
0452281881|5.0|i was truly surprised that it would be this well-written when i began reading it (saturday aft, and kept through until after 3am)... then i began reading it again from the beginning, and lots more fell into place in my understanding....<BR>it's an easy read, but a worthwhile one.  i am impressed with the logic and the organisation involved in keeping track of the threads and the plot lines, as well as the care involved in the timestamps of the messages, and the true-to-life differences between emailing someone on your own server vs. external (ie. you'll see the full addy spelled out vs. just the person's name, etc).<br />besides the craft involved in making this hilarous tale work, i also enjoyed:<BR>- the two-facedness of almost every character who lacks integrity, subtlely shown to the reader in contrasts<BR>- DC's characterisation was very believable-- quite a rounded part--&gt; he was acrid, devious, etc. but he could also cut through the smarmy BS he was being handed with sarcastic wit... what a treat-- IRL, a CEO would prolly only fall for it<BR>- despite the limited &quot;camera eye&quot;, a lot was revealed-- appropriately, too-- about people's personality and defects. <br />the things which might have been better IMHO are:<BR>- the ending.... &quot;it is hard to put my finger on why&quot; but it could have been more-- could it be that i simply didn't want it to end?<BR>- some of the emails i could not readily find a pairing for... partially why i felt driven to re-read the novel imediately<br />ALSO:<BR>- not all the britishisms i got... perhaps a native could draw up a handy reference guide(ie. explain the significance of &quot;cards in phone boxes all over W1&quot;, and is &quot;taking the piss&quot; a good thing or a bad thing, wot?)<br />all in all, a truly great piece of comedy and very carefully written!
B00005JMEW|5.0|or hate it.  When it comes to Quentin Tarantino, there is no middle ground.  Personally, I loved it (as well as Volume 2, a wacky yet mature conclusion to the homage-fest that was Volume 1).  Everything from the cinematography to the way Tarantino strategically places music throughout his films, Quentin gets better with each outing.  The House of Blue Leaves sequence alone will be studied in film schools for years to come.  The PERFECT action sequence from a director who has never done an action sequence before.  The pacing, the music, the use of color (from black and white to the silhouetted fight), the hilarity of limbs flying everywhere.  Tarantino is the man.  No one can question his ability to get the most out of his actors.  Where can I start?  Travolta and Jackson in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  Grier and Forster in &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;.  And virtually everyone (especially Thurman and Carradine) in &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.<br />And a little ditty from Tom Moore, taken from an earlier review:<br />&quot;This film features a couple of vengeful females trying to be tough like men.Its a predictable overused theme in many films today and americans are growing bored with it.Watching men do fight scenes is far more entertaining,especially remembering that men invented Kung Fu and sword fighting.Men invented physical toughness too.&quot;<br />Boy, I don't know if I even want to touch that one.  Feeling a little insecure there, Tom?  Have to defend the notion that men are better at being big and bad to boost your feelings of masculinity?  Personally, I enjoyed watching Uma kick some ace.  Here's one American who's not tired of seeing some women kick tail (as long as it's done the right way; i.e. NOT Charlie's Angels).
0451191153|2.0|Ayn Rand cracks me up a bit. I am a Senior studying philosophy and yet I have never heard her mentioned as an important philosopher, never seen her mentioned in contemporary philosophy or even seen any professor feel a need to respond to her. And yet she, and her followers claim they being the true gospel, the gospel of egoism. They claim to be a very influential philosophy.<BR>Howard Roark, the hero of the book (which is very well written and enjoyable as literature) is a sad, overly independent man who we are suppossed to love because of his fierce authenticity. But his unlikable independence comes across as an unrealistic, overly ascetic and uncaring egoist. He doesn't depend on anyone and feels only strongly when forcing himself on the world. He is the epitomie of Heidegger's technologically minded man, and as such an example of a most undesirable and dangerous mindset.<BR>Niezsche portrays a better ubermensch. <BR>Either way, this ignorance to the needs of others and the lack of any ethical duty (see Levinas) towards the other, results in the greedy (...)caste that run around screaming for less government intervention so they don't have to help anybody but themselves. As Pearl Jam would say: That's evolution baby!<BR>So feel free to read the book, enjoy it. But please don't think \\"objectivism\\" is coherent. And don't go around raping people because you think you are a Roark.
0385504209|4.0|While it is doubtful that The DaVinci Code will be revered alongside the likes of William Shakespeare, Dan Brown has crafted a fairly intricate and tight thriller.  When reading this work, it is essential to remember this is a murder mystery at heart, not a volume on theology.<br />The fractured early history of Christianity, the Priory of Sion, Mary and the holy grail and numerous other concepts in this book are not original to the author, but have been freely available for numerous years.  The author merely uses them to encapsulate his mystery and make it far more interesting.  It is certainly not a book that should be criticized like a non fiction book.  Authors are bound to take artistic license here and there to enhance the drama and action in the story.<br />That being said, the book is efficiently written and the action moves at an adequate pace to keep a reader interested through the 450+ pages.  Dan Brown breaks the book into numerous short chapters allowing the reader to have a sense of accomplishment while reading it.  Told in a linear fashion with numerous changes of scene, the reader can easily keep up with the plot and many characters.  Character development could have been better as we don't really get to know what makes any of them tick.  Exposition through narrative is minimal; used only when necessary.  Most exposition is handled by the characters' interaction with each other.  This is a very effective way to reveal the facts to the reader.<br />If you like a mystery and have a theological bent, you will probably enjoy this book.  The proper midset is essential.  If you read this book to criticize it, you will quickly sour on it.  It's not very deep so lay back and have some fun.
B000002G7G|5.0|This is album is stunning from top to bottom.  They only had four official releases, so you might as well have all of them.  It may be the best, it may be the fourth best, it doesn't matter.  What makes them such an incredible force is that they have the capabilities to make a screeching noise album and follow it up with a lullaby album, and they both are better than anything you will find today.  The control over the instruments should not be doubted, they are aware of their limits more than you are.  Lyrically you couldn't wish for greater.  Not Dylan or Young or Waits or Davies or Lennon or Springsteen or Billy Joel ever came up with a line better than, &quot;Between thought and expression lies a lifetime&quot;  And for that reviewer who said &quot;Murder Mystery&quot; is the only flaw on the album, listen to it closer, it is a mystery and all of the elements are there, I've listened to that song hundreds of times and I still haven't heard half of it or figured it out. I'm not one for knocking a band as good as Velvet Underground, if you don't like music too noisy, this is the best one to get, if you do like noise, still get it, get this album, get this album, get it and listen to it and your world will be better for it
0385336810|4.0|If you like the drama then you'll like this book. She goes on a trip for work and has one too many cocktails and spills her guts to non other than the guy that she's suppose to work for.oops, I did it again.
0156027321|1.0|I have to agree with Paul R. Gagnon.    I liked the premise and Pi probably would have made a great short story.  Unfortunately it really didn't pan out to a great novel. <BR>I feel the author has talent but needs to get more of a story line to develop a fantastic story-telling ability.<BR>I'm waiting for Martel's next book!
B0000025ZF|4.0|Much better than Radio Kaos, and musically, the Final Cut.  Roger takes us back to the wall era Floyd sound.  Back to the anger in the wall, as opposed to the contained fury of the final cut.  The tracks flow cleanly into the others, and in particular &quot;Apparently they were traveling abroad&quot; is musically excellent.  In most place this is almost as good as the wall.<br />Not quite 5 stars though, and not quite as original as Amused to death, this one sounds closer to pink floyd.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|For the 2nd time I cried when listening to Michael Buble's tribute song to his grandfather - You'll Never Know. It's beautiful. What a compliment to be paid, grandpa I'm envious of you!<BR>From Nice and Easy, Come Fly with Me, Mack the Knife, My Funny Valentine and more, Buble' hits every note and makes every song his own, and he does it better than any singer I've ever heard.<BR>His sound is so appealing - soothing and rich, and his delivery is like silk, as smooth as could be.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|There will always be people who only have the patience for music like this, so here is their holy grail, this month.   I am assuming that either they are younger, or they don't have any passion for music outside of immediate gradification.<br />Also, for me, it has become necessary for albums to spark thought.  Not a single relevent idea resounds in this album.  This doesn't apply to those who look for immediate gratification.<br />Finally to those interested in her body, rather than the body of music associated with her.  You will eventually realize that there are much more cost effective ways to satisfy those &quot;needs&quot;.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|(see above for a full film synopsis)<br />In short, this film is about a man who finds out he can travel back into his past to change events, which inevitably leads to tragedy.  His main reason was to save his girlfriend from tragedy, but then by doing so, other tragic events happen as a result (the chaos theory comes into effect), and he has to keep going back to alter them.<br />This is an incredibly depressing film!  Literally nothing happy happens and its one tragedy after another, dealing with murder, prostitution, vandalism, even paedophilia.<BR>Its not a bad film, its quite well executed, well acted, but for me the actual way he can go back in time (by reading his journals??? - its a simple as that) is just lazy writing. Its never explained how this 'phenomenon' works.<br />This is a poor mans Donnie Darko in my mind, but I'd rent the dvd and not buy it.
0385507755|5.0|This is a well told, humanistic story of addiction and the abuse of self. Much Like that of &quot;Dry&quot; it serves to not only explain the reasons behind the actions but how to deal with and learn to overcome. It is a courageous story within the abuse of a life like that of &quot;Nightmares Echo&quot;. It has detailed accountablity like that of &quot;Running With Scissors&quot; and in a gut wrenching,hard to put down,well written book that I highly recommend.
B00005JMEW|5.0|(See above for synopsis)<BR>No point in rehashing the storyline for you - you can read that in the synopsis above.  Just my opinion of the film is all thats required here...<br />This truly is an outstanding film:<BR>Incredible action sequences, great characters (especially the 17 year old Japanese assassin) excellent casting and as has become expected of QT, fantastic music.<br />QT has mixed so many exciting genres of film together to make one truly exciting and stylish film.  Spaghetti Western, Martial Arts / Japanese Anime, and whilst its a brutal film, its also very funny.<br />I love the way that to beat the censors, one of the goriest (and lengthy) scenes changes to black and white to beat cuts.  This adds to the overall style of the film.<br />This film is so exciting, it has made Kill Bill Vol2 my most anticipated film of 2004. <br />KILL BILL KICKS ASS!!!<br />The lack of any worthwhile DVD extras are disappointing - I imagine they are being saved for a final box set later in 2004.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I bought this DVD, without even seeing the film in the first place. I didn't see it at the theatres because of all the negative hype on the &quot;glorified violence&quot;. After seeing this film, I can say that it is violent, yes, but without the gore. If you want real gore, go see something like Silence of the Lambs, or better yet, The Passion of the Christ. The violence here is on the level of comic books, and in the tradition of the old samurai films (the 'baby and carriage' series comes to mind). It is a pure delight to see how the film is woven together masterfully, any film student will find it intellectually and artistically stimulating.
B00005JKNC|3.0|...Jim Carrey does a fine job of dramatic acting, the plot is fairly intriguing, there is a cogent anti-McCarthyism subtext, and yet---and yet this film falls short of its potential, mainly during the final 15 minutes or so when it collapses into cornball sentimentalism and preachiness.<br />Looks like a good case of life imitating art: in the beginning of the film, we see Carrey as a Hollywood screenwriter at a meeting with some studio bigwigs with famously horrible schmatzy taste who mangle his written film's ending while trying to please the masses and drive up box office profits.  &quot;The Majestic&quot; seems to have suffered the exact same fate, though probably at the hands of braindead focus groups as much as cheesy studio bosses.<br />Enjoy the first 3/4 of the film, then fast forward through the last bit.
1400079179|5.0|It's no wonder Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci code\\" was the number 1 best-seller of 2003 and keeps going in 2004. It has elements averybody is intrigued of, and likes to read about: criptography, hidden codes, murder, pursuits on land and on air, a beautiful woman, symbology, deceipting works of art, amazing minds, secret societies, the Catholic Church and the secret everybody born on the occidental world has at least once asked himself: what is the Holy Grail and where is it hidden?<br /><br />From the first time I heard about this book it has intrigued me. All elements stated above were, at least for me, more than enough reason to buy this book. I bought it, read it and enjoyed every minute I spent on it.<br /><br />Are the ideas on the book original? Clearly not. But, in fact, Brown mentions some of the inspiration-works to his book in the text: \\"Holy blood Holy Grail\\" is one example, cited at least three or four times.<br /><br />Are the characters ill-developed and somewhat flat? A little, but once you're engaged in read this book, this won't matter a bit.<br /><br />Are the facts depicted in the book true? I don't know, and I think neither does Brown, but in order for his book to sell, and in order for it to be convincing, Brown HAD to create a book  based on the premise that all those facts are true. Anyway, what made me like \\"The Da Vinci code\\" was not only the possibility that all those ideas might be the truth, but the fact that Brown collected all of them, organized them, created a very nice conspiracy theory around them, and delivered us a great fictional book.<br /><br />Saying \\"The Da Vinci code\\" is: bad; unconvincing; impossible; improbable; etc.-etc.-etc. is like saying, for example, that the Indiana Jones movies series are likewise. It's only justificative is: lack of imagination. Hidden facts, obtuse meanings, ancient codes, they exist for us, common mortal beings, to toy with them, to wonder if they are real, what their secret meanings are. Brown did it, and I'm grateful he did. I enjoyed his book immensely. Even the ending, usually the weak point in works of this nature, satisfyed me.<br /><br />Anyway, Dan Brown knows how to write fiction, and he knows how to deliver an excellent fictional book about a subject that gets everybody interested and discussing it in several circles. The sales charts are there to prove it. Bear that word in mind: FICTION. This is what it is. Brown accomplished what he wanted. Good or bad (you can believe what you want) his book is still at the top of the charts, and his future books will also certainly be number-one best-sellers. Brown now wears the self-concious smile portrayed in Da Vinci's most known work of art.<br /><br />Grade 9.1/10e. Brown did it, and I'm grateful he did. I enjoyed his book immensely.

B00005JMEW|1.0|While I certainly admire Tarantino's style as a filmmaker, this is a classic case of something filled with sound and fury signifying nothing.  All style and absolutely no substance, it was like watching a two hour video game fight scene, with the gore setting turned on maximum.  I suppose young boys (and yet to grow up college males) love this kind of mindless blood fest, but I just hated it.  I really hated this movie.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|It's great to hear that bands like Fleetwood Mac can still produce such a good record. I have to admit that the first time that I have heard it, I didn't like it that much. But once you hear it twice and you get into it, you can't stop listening. <BR>There are pretty good vocal melodies, the rythmic guitars and solos fit perfectly with the songs... this is classic Rock n'roll with current production tricks that makes it an album from any era. <BR>Finally, the mix between male and female vocals (lindsey and stevie) it always amazing to hear, they can be so diverse within the melodies, that you can hear many bands in one.<BR>One of the song highlights: Peace Keeper (Hear this one first)

B0001Z52RU|4.0|In this new dramatic film featuring Ashton Kutcher & Amy Smart, Kutcher's character is introduced when he is a child and appears to have blocked memories and blackouts associated with psychological stressors.  Then he is a teen with similar issues, and then he appears as a college student (where Kutcher becomes the character).  At this point, he starts going through his old journals and his mind goes back to traumatic childhood episodes, where he discovers that he can change what happened by mentally altering his actions during the episode recall.  When he returns from these mental flashbacks, reality has changed according to what he did in the flashback.  Unfortunately, each time he tries to change things for the better, another painful reality unfolds.  This is an excellent concept and Ashton Kutcher gets to be more dramatic in this role than in his prior TV & movie parts.  I thought this was a well done movie and expect that the U.S. DVD release will have some interesting bonus features to further explore the concepts of the movie.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I love most of the Disney movies whether they are animated or acted. What impressed me most about this movie was not just the animation, voice acting, and music great, but the moral was super. Most good movies have a lesson to be learned. This one was incredibly simple and to the point. Value all people and learn what they have to offer no matter what their sex, believes, et cetera. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family. It is ashame Disney hasn't learned it shouldn't limit the sales of their movies yet. I think they are going to learn the hard way when someone buys them out and stops the stupid moratorium policy. I know if I could buy Disney the first thing I would do is fire the person or persons responsible for the moratorium and second I would immediately make all Disney movies available all the time. If you see negative votes here there is a good possibility they come from scalpers. They want to sell you used Disney movies for three or four times what they are worth. They don't want them to be available all the time. They want them to be unavailable for at least eight years.
0380977788|5.0|This short novel wins almost every major fantasy & science fiction award but once again the ALA committee blows it by handing the Newbury to an inferior novel. [I'm a librarian and can say that with some amount of authority--although maybe not much.] This book is an instant classic but was probably too dark for the at times very timid committee.  At least Gaiman's not alone.  E. B. White didn't win for Charlotte's Web and S. E. Hinton didn't win for The Outsiders.  I suspect for much the same reasons.  Regardless this is a beautifully written tale about a fine, tough little kid blessed with dry wit and great courage who works her way through events that would panic most adults.  If the book reminds you a bit of Alice In Wonderland, good.  It should.  Both are books that are dark enough to unnerve some adults and good enough to enchant children.  I'll be reading this one to my kids, grandkids and whoever will listen until I'm in my dotage.  Buy it, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Very happy to hear that Gaiman's newest novel, 'The Graveyard Book', has actually won the Newbury Award.  It's a well deserved honor.
B0001I55OC|4.0|Wow this movie was weird.  A secret organization finds out how to travel through time to France in this case.  The war with France and Britan.  I have never thought of the middle ages being so horrible and intense.  I liked this movie because these archeoligists who love history finally realized they were in history and already responsible for the present.  It was the OLD Planet of the Apes type of time travel where the historians discover a cycle!  Cool Very Cool!

B0001VWP8I|5.0|Her Diva Fabulousness Anastacia has moved to a more rock sound than her previous albums, which had more of an R&B flavour.  Her collaborations this time are primarily with Glen Ballard, the man credited with working with such giants as Alanis Morissette and more recently Dave Matthews.  And as long as I was waiting for this album, let me say that every second was worth it.  Written primarily during her ordeal with breast cancer, Anastacia has crafted an album which is far more personal and touching than her previous two masterworks, and listening to her talk about the writing process and how painful it was, how she could write a single verse before being completely exhausted, it makes the end result that much more incredible.  The album opens with \\"Seasons Change,\\" heavy with the guitar riffs and gives us a taste of what's to come.  \\"Left Outside Alone\\" is the second track, and astute listeners will notice that there this is a different mix than the single version, which mixes things up a little.  \\"Time\\" may contain a few trite phrases about the way we perceive time, but she weaves it fabulously in the melody and it's a fantastic track when she's finished with it.  \\"Sick and Tired\\" is one of the strengths of this album, where she details some of her ordeal lyrically, but the song's hook is infections, and I could put it on repeat without tiring of it.  \\"Heavy On My Heart\\" is slower, but much more intimate about what she faced during her illness.  \\"I Do\\" is a much more angry song, and features the vocals of Sonny Sandoval from P.O.D., though his contributions are minimal.  Having read the lyrics, I'm tempted to say that the song is a critique of current American policy, but I'm not entirely sure.  Being as she currently lives in London, it could easily be...  \\"Welcome To My Truth\\" is about still retaining the capacity to love after all of the disillusionment and heartbreak and pain that she's faced, which is fantastic.  Infectious is the rhythm of \\"Pretty Little DumDum,\\" a tale about a woman and a bastardly guy, with great lines like \\"He says that you're the one one / But that's eleven in his eyes.\\"  Fantastic.  \\"Sexy Single\\" was Her Diva Fabulousness' collaboration with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics fame, and it details being okay with not having a man around-great to hear.  \\"Rearview\\" is a great song about meaning to come back to someone to find that that they're gone, but accepting change.  \\"Where Do I Belong\\" slows things down a bit, and the track is quite raw and emotional.  \\"Maybe Today\\" is a fitting final track and the second collaboration with Dave Stewart, slowing things down even more, and it mellows the sounds with a piano and strings, and the lyrics are just fantastic.  It's official-Anastacia is an absolutely amazing album.  I'd go so far as to give it an 11/10.

B00003CXXP|2.0|At least part of the scientific community has an intense interest in the possibility of artificial intelligence and that interest is reflected as an obsession among some science fiction writers and devotees.  I have a casual relationship at best with the sciences myself and I generally find science fiction not to my taste.  There are exceptions.  I thought \\"Blade Runner\\" was one of the finest films made.  But I emphasize that \\"Blade Runner\\" is an exception in my book.  \\"Blade Runner\\" rises above much of the rest of science fiction because although the film seems to be about robots it is clear by the end the film is a mediation on the human condition in the face of death.  The problem with A.I. is that there is no such reflection on the human condition; instead, the concern is about the future welfare for the fantastic machines we may build in the future.<br />Many in the scientific community believe that people are essentially \\"walking machines\\"-fantastic \\"machines\\"-but \\"machines\\" nonetheless.  What is meant by this is the rejection of any notion of a \\"spirit\\" which animates the body.  We are simply collections of atoms which evolved over great stretches of time-a complex amalgam of conditioned stimulus and response reactions.  Moreover, it is believed that consciousness and thinking as we commonly think of them are really illusions-they are no more than physical chemical interactions within the body.  In fact, the notion we have of something called \\"I\\" is also just an illusion.  There really is no \\"I\\" and educated men and women really shouldn't take the concept seriously except as a way of speaking.  Philosophically, this is known as \\"radical materialism\\".<br />If you accept these premises, then one can believe it is possible to one day create a \\"thinking/feeling\\" machine, which very much resembles a human being.  Indeed, such a machine could one day be regarded as very much the same thing as a human being.  And why not?  If one assumes that there is no \\"ghost\\" in the machines we call human beings then we can dispense with any concern that these fantastic machines we will build may need a \\"soul\\" to be regarded as \\"real\\" beings.  Thus since we will be essentially equal we need to care about their dignity and well being.<br />In science fiction we as the reader just have to accept that certain assertions in the text are \\"just so\\".  But when a serious \\"real world\\" message is being made we have to question the foundations that message is laid upon.  Much has been made of the similarity between the story in Artificial Intelligence and the story of Pinocchio.  But a comparison of the two stories only shows how different they are.  In A.I., David is made by human beings.  David is much like other robots these humans have made except he is programmed to have \\"feelings\\" and \\"affections\\".  David's dependence and love for his human \\"mother\\" are imprinted and programmed in-once so imprinted it is irreversible.  David's \\"human mother\\" is essentially \\"his\\" as long as David exists.  If something goes wrong and David's human parents no longer want him, he must be returned to the manufacturer to be deactivated.<br />In Pinocchio, a wooden puppet is made to live by a magical spiritual being.  Although it is not explicitly stated, we understand that the wooden Pinocchio has been given a spirit or soul.  Pinocchio's affections and feelings do not have to be programmed in because they are real aspects of his soul.  Both Pinocchio and David want to be real boys.  Both feel deprivation with the separation from their \\"human parents\\".  The message of Artificial Intelligence seems to be we should be very careful in building artificial beings because we may develop creatures who are essentially like us except we will feel free to subjugate them and submit them to inhuman cruelties.  Pinocchio's message in part is a Christian one.  It's message is that our human failings lie not in our \\"flesh\\" as the Gnostics believe but in our souls.  Because Pinocchiohad a soul he was \\"real\\" and he was capable of real human failings and greatness.  In Christianity, wood is a symbol for man.  The Great Carpenter fashions men to His purposes.<br />Human beings have long had a fondest for their tools.  While men and women often treasure their tools and inventions, they have never regarded them as equals to themselves.  If one believes the only beings that really matter are those with spirits or souls, it is unclear why we should care about \\"machines\\" with the intensity Spielberg and company want us to.  Moreover, there are serious doubts that \\"artificial intelligence\\" as they mean it is possible.<br />The message of the film is that like an unwanted baby it would be better if such a \\"thinking/feeling machine\\" were never brought into the world.  But the more serious question is is the \\"lack\\" in that unwanted \\"baby/machine\\" or is it is our hearts?  Exploring that question would have given us a far different film.had a soul he was \\"real\\" and he was capable of real human failings and greatness.  In Christianity, wood is a symbol for man.

B00005QIPH|4.0|Before all the cynics start, the 'hype' had no effect on me because I never heard any of the hype.  I had seen 'Last Nite', '12:51'and 'Reptilia' on music channels, all three of which I found infectiously catchy.  Nobody had ever told me about the strokes, and I don't usually buy music magazines, so I went out and bought both albums based on hearing these songs alone.<br />I came home and listened to this album, and I was very pleased with my purchase, although at first I thought some of the songs were a little similar to each other.  I dispelled this idea after listening for a second time and began to enjoy each of the tracks on different levels.  No, they don't fill me with some deep emotion or inspire me to achieve greater things, but they do make me feel good, very good.  Each song flows along seamlessly.  The guitar playing is excellent, everything has a fantastic rhythm to it and the lyrics are delivered brilliantly.<br />Many people don't like the Strokes because they don't like that the fact that they are highly influenced by past bands.  So what?  The fact is that, these days, there aren't many bands around who make music like the Strokes do.  I see it as bringing back a good thing from the past.<br />I enjoy every song on the album, and I would say that 'Take it or leave it' is just about my favourite.  4/5 because, despite being an excellent collection of songs, it isn't quite long enough to be considered a classic.  Great to listen to and as good as 'Room on Fire'.  Can't wait for their third release.

0156027321|5.0|At the beginning of this book, the reader is informed that the main character, Pi Patel survived a terrible ordeal aboard a life boat many years ago.  During the course of the book, he tells the story in great detail of how his father attempted to move his family from India to Canada.  Pi, along with his parents and brother, was aboard a ship that sank.  He ended up on a life boat with a small group of animals, which his zookeeper father was transporting to various zoos.  By his wits and by the grace of God which he worshipped as a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu, Pi does survive an experience which would have killed a person with less hope or fewer survival skills.  At the end, Pi is questioned by two Japanese men who represent the company who owned the ship that sank.  They do not believe his story and so Pi tells the story again, in a condensed form and changes some of the details.  The reader is left with the dilemma as to which story is true.  This is an extremely creative book which you won't soon forget!

0812550706|5.0|The experiences of Ender Wiggins hallmarks the strategy concepts surrounding decisive warfare wins; through out the book Ender wins against Stilson, Bonzo, the teachers, and the buggers; early in Ender's young life, ender learns how to kill; Ender's circumstances of killing were observed by the I.F, who did not intervene to prevent the homicides; instead the I.F learned Ender's isolation, desire to win, and creativity could be harnessed for their own purposes. Nevertheless, Ender is a killer, a dark character, darker than Peter. The buggers view humans as not intelligent and excessively brutal and violent. The Buggers attack earth and start a war. The buggers could have originated from earth, are mentally connected, and travel the space distance faster than the speed of light.<br />Peter is the antagonist. However, Peter never kills, he manipulates, threats, and twists both Valentine and Ender to conform with his plots. It is Ender's desire to receive Peter's love. Peter and Ender divide as brothers with Ender becoming a great general and Peter the controlling political force of earth. Peter becomes Locke and Valentine, Demosthenes using their father citizen key to gain access to the nets. Locke and Demosthenes are recognized as great political writers controlling the minds of people of the earth; Locke supports the Warsaw pact and Demosthene a moderate view appealing to the common man for the war. After Ender destroys the buggers, Locke ostracizes Ender to the Bugger world. In the last effort repudiation of Peter, Valentine leaves with Ender to the Bugger world. Ender will arrive at the bugger world in two years, realize familiar scene from the desktop, find a the queen hive, and desire to restore the buggers.<br /><br />Interestingly Ender never realizes, he has killed both Stilson and Bonzo, instead he believes his victories are a product of superior intelligence, remorse is never a part of the experience; the I.F carefully controls Ender to produce an objective killing machine. So, Ender believes pain is good and pain can be used to control or defeat enemies. Even after being betrayed by the I.F, Ender realized he was glad too be a survivior and rejoices in not being killed by the buggers with his friends. Ender's soldier revered him as their commander.<br /><br />General Pace and Colonel Graf careful protected Ender and manipulated him into becoming the supreme commander of the I.F forces against the buggers. Ender training forms him into a fanastic commander, order intricate battle advancements, sacrifices, and surprising offensive tactics. Ender learns to always win, sometimes breaking the rules to win, but always winning. The game becomes reality. Ender learns from Maser Rankham the first bugger victory came when Rankam surprised the buggers by attacking the queen ship, apparently the bugger never thought such an attempt could be done and once the queen was dead the drones were helpless because the collective mind links were useless and so they eventual all died.<br /><br />The supreme command had to be young. Ender was young, seven when he entered the academy and twelve when he lead the I.F forces against the buggers. Youth allowed Ender's inhibitions to act too remain at a minimum; he was willing to take risks and adapt with creative strategies and attack patterns; the result being defeat of all the training armies in the school: fatique odds matching him unevenly against multiple armies, unfair advantages, and eventually 1000 to 1 game scenerios were all part of the game. Ender learns the Greek warfare lesson, \\"if you want to win, don't play the enemies games.\\" In the case of 300 Spartians depending a narrow pass against hundreds of thousands of Persians with kill ratios around 15,000 men to one Spartian.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|Fog of War, a film I first saw having heard nothing about but saw randomly, is a brilliant work by Morris.  On a repeat viewing, the lessons by McNamara held no less poignancy nor emotion.  Although in the latter half of the film the pacing starts to drag a bit, I would not change it--the pacing is the way it is simply because it is material that must be absorbed, realized, internalized, and chewed on.  Having recently read A Rumor of War, by Philip Caputo in addition to a good, if dense history of the war by George Herring, it made watching Fog of War all the better.  Highly recommended--both the man, and the movie.

0553269631|5.0|I stumbled upon The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter a couple of years ago and purchased it for a dollar.  I think it was on one or more of the &quot;greatest 100&quot; lists that folks publish on various boards, so I scooped it right up.  I did enjoy the writing and the complexities of the story, even if it is occasionally bleak and sad.  One aspect I loved is that it did hone in on a tiny microcosm within a single town, showing universality in a finite manner.  <br />The main &quot;lonely&quot; characters look to the deaf-mute John Singer as possessing incredible listening and audience skills, and they all literally go to him, turn to him, for obviously merely tacit advice, to pour out their hearts, while revealing their troubles and dreams.  It is as if they project the answers they are searching for onto his dignified and quiet persona.  Little do they know that he is as lonely and mixed up as they are, after losing his companion to insanity.  Singer's stream of consciousness is noteworthy.<BR>The book moves back and forth among each character's story, but it is linear and easily followed.  The budding teenager Mick stole the show, and I found Doctor Copeland to be the most interesting character, yet the questions left surrounding the human condition involving racism, family, communism, alcoholism, aspirations, relationships, etc., run the gamut of human existence, and they are sensitively portrayed by an amazing (at the time) 23 year old writer.<BR>This novel is a stellar example of a work standing the test of time.<br />Roe<br />Recommended.<br />Roe

Wagner<br />Loving Family<br /> John Grisham, in his eyes that Christmas was more of a chore then a holiday with family, friends, tree, lights, gifts, and fire.  Grisham novel, Skipping Christmas is a five-star rating, because he shows that Christmas is about the friends, and the family.  Grisham shows Christmas is not about how many ordements you have on your tree or if you have a ham or turkey for dinner but is about how people come together and show there love.  Grisham talks about how people can come together and help each other out when they are down on their luck.<br /> This book is all about a family that wants to skip Christmas.  Their daughter Blair goes away to Peru a month before Christmas and will not be back for a year.  Her parents Luther and Nora decide to go away for Christmas to take a cruise.  It sounds like a wonderful idea.  They would not do anything for Christmas no tree, Christmas party, lights, and no frosty on the roof.  Luther was a tax accountant and he did not like spending all his money on Christmas and going to the stores and buying gifts and waiting in traffic to him was a chore not a pleasure.<br /> Luther and Nora went each day trying to avoid anything to do with Christmas the neighbors tied to sell them calendars, trees, and fruitcakes but all they said was that they were sorry but they were not doing Christmas this year.  They were all confused and upset and wanted to ask so many questions but did not.  There was a contest for most decorated road in he town and one neighbor named Frohmeyer always wanted to win.  The whole road was to put a frosty on the roof of the house so each house would be somewhat the same.  Frohmeyer wanted Luther to do Christmas so bad that he took a picture of Luther's house with no lights or frosty on the roof and sent it to their local newspaper.  Luther was mad but did not give up they were only a couple of weeks away now.<br /> A couple more weeks later on Christmas Eve day they both slept in late.  When they got up they were ready to pack and go on there cruise until they got a phone call it was Blair there daughter said that she would be home for Christmas and is bring home her fianc&eacute; named Enrique.  They wanted her to come home and so they said that they are doing the party, tree, frosty, and Christmas.  They stared planning everything out Luther would go get a tree, and decorate it while Nora would go get food and think who to invite to the party.  Luther got a tree but when he got home it was nothing more then branches so his neighbor loaned him his tree seeing that he goes away each Christmas with his family.  He decorated it and started calling people for the party.  There was everyone was busy.

B0000942HV|1.0|They say that the sign of an artist losing his creativity is that he begins to plaigarize himself.  In the case of Mr. Oldfield, we can see one of the most startling cases of self-plaigarism in the history of recorded music.  He has taken his most successful album and pilfered it for ideas and inspiration not once, not twice, not thrice, but FOUR TIMES.  Mike, STOP IT!  <br />The latest, Tubular Bells 2003 represents a recent trend in the artistic community that is deeply disturbing to me.  The REMAKE.  Let's take a classic moment of artistic inspiration and creativity, and make it again so that it's brighter and shinier and free of all the rough edges.  Be honest, was Star Wars really improved when George Lucas vandalized it?  Did the Psycho remake add anything whatsoever?  It seems as if the art industry has become so utterly devoid of originality that all they can do is feed us leftover goulash made from past efforts.<br />And now we have Mike Oldfield and Tubular Bells.  As a young musician, he created one of the most original, creative and incredible pieces of music ever recorded.  On the original recording (as with any original), we have, captured on tape, the moment of inspiration.  All great works of art have this.  It is something intangible that comes through, something that's hard to describe, but you can FEEL it.  You can feel the excitement that the artist felt at this moment of inspiration.  It doesn't HAVE to be technically perfect.  To remake a masterpiece with the aim of infusing technical perfection entirely misses the point.  The new Tubular Bells 2003 might just as well have been a computer generated copy: technically superior, but entirely devoid of emotion, humanity, that intangible feeling that made the original so special.<br />My advice to anyone interested:  DO NOT BUY THIS.  HURRY UP AND BUY THE ORIGINAL RECORDING BEFORE SOMEONE DECIDES TO MAKE THE 2003 VERSION THE ONLY VERSION AVAILABLE.  <br />Recognize this for what it is.  It is not awork of art.  It is a business decision.  Like all remakes, it is a quick and easy way to make few dollars without really having to work at it.<br />There.  I'm done.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is my favorite Pink Floyd album because it has so many dimensions.  This is an album that one could sit and think about for hours or listen to while mopping the kitchen floor.  Animals is a short album, only five songs and under forty-five minutes long, but contains more genius in the lyrics and music than most of today's ninety minute compilation discs.  The thought-provoking lyrics and songs in Animals show Roger Waters at his creative best, while the guitar and other music in the album show the talents of Dave Gilmour and the rest of Pink Floyd.  <BR> To call anything Pink Floyd made \\"underrated\\" is unfair.  The band was one of the most popular groups of the seventies, and holds two albums on the Top Twenty Best Selling Albums of all time.  However, Animals never got the public press it deserved, mainly due to the fact that none of the songs off the album could be played on the radio as singles.  The five songs on the album are either under two minutes or more than ten, which does not appeal to everyone.  Also, this album came between the two of the band's biggest albums, Wish You Were Here and The Wall.  The production of Animals rivals that of Dark Side of the Moon, and Animals is an excellent example of Pink Floyd's creative and musical genius, which can be seen just by looking in the liner note artwork.  <BR> The signature of Pink Floyd, however, is not their notoriety but their music.  Animals contains five brilliant songs that with masterful guitar and drums and thought provoking lyrics.  My favorite lines are found in the seventeen-minute masterpiece \\"Dogs,\\" a bitter satire on money-hungry business people.  These lines play on the life of these people, like \\"... In the end you'll pack up, fly down south, and hide your head in the sand; just another sad old man, all alone and dying of cancer.\\"  Another interesting lyrical point in the album is the numerous references to \\"the Stone.\\"  One could ponder the meaning of such mentions, or just enjoy the music.  Also, the guitar solos in Animals, especially on \\"Dogs\\" and Sheep,\\" will have you convinced that Dave Gilmour is the best guitarist of all time.  <BR> Although it is not as heavily drug influenced as earlier Pink Floyd Albums such as Dark Side of the Moon, Animals has its own distinct sound and feel, as well as noteworthy lyrics and guitar.  I would recommend this album to anyone with the capacity for abstract thought, and I would tell him or her to be prepared to find themselves astonished at the creativity and savvy wit of Pink Floyd.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|If you are the type of person that needs art films explained to you by your deeper minded friends when the movie is over, then this film is difinitely not for you.  This movie is hilarious and thought provoking all at the same time.  Bill Murray is phenomenal!  It's not that he is being real, as some other reviewers have written, it's that he can make the most mundane scene just drip with funniest irony imaginable.  This may be one of his best roles of all time.  You will know you understood the movie when it makes you think and rerun it in your mind over and over again just absorb every little bit of absurdity, hilarity, and subtle nuances.  There is a plot despite what many reviewers have said, loneliness.  At least see it once (rent it, don't buy at first), if you don't like it, fine, but if you do spend the money to own it as it will probably become one of your all time favorites.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is an incredible movie - powerful, great acting, and innovative techniques.<br />Brilliant, and a definite must see.
B00009APK1|2.0|ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. . .<br />This movie is at most mediocre as is The Fellowship. The acting is amazing and the music is beautiful, but everything else sucks.<br />The special effects are overwhelming and beat the simplistic storyline down into a bloody pulp. The biggest problem with these movies is the directing. It's tedious, and boring, scanning vast scenery slowly and mind numbingly; the beginning credits whoich lasted no more then three minutes felt like 20. And as for the movie's length at three hours, it felt like more like five, because of poor character developement.<br />The stupid dialogue is set as a volume so low a dog couldn't hear it, and the soundtrack is set so loud that someone could here it from one-hundred miles away. Whatever charm the books seemed to have have been erased with these movies. Personally, I find the whole concept stupid: a bunch of humans and mythical creatures trying to toss a supernatural ring into a volcano uncreatively called mount doom so that they can get rid of an all powerful autocrat and install their own all powerful autocrat. And what's more, the kid who risks his life and goes scytzophrenic to throw the stupid ring in mount doom doesn't even get to be king? I'd like to give each member of the Fellowship of the Ring an uzi, grenade launcher and MP5 and see what the dark forces of Sauron could do.<br />And back to the specifics to this movie. It and the Return of the King starts off with no backtracking and begins exatcly where the Fellowship left off, leaving people who aren't directly familiar with the storyline lost.<br />This movie is a Royal Bore. Don't waste your money.
B0000C8AQM|3.0|I know the song &quot;the wait&quot; from metallica is in the film but not on the soundtrack.  Maybe that's the one you want?
0767805712|4.0|A great sci-fi film that has genetic engineering, class discrimination and an intriguing murder mystery. Ethan Hawke is fantastic as Vincent, a man with a heart defect who has to fool the world in order to be a recruit for space flight. Jude Law's performance as Jerome, the cripple who gives his own identity to Vincent, is one of the best performances of the 90's. Law's best scene is when he has to climb the stairs only using his arms. Amazing!
B000007638|4.0|This CD is awesome. The only track on it that I don't like is My Love, and to be fair I hated that one before I got WOA, so I'm a bit byast.<br />But everything else is awesome. One track that I didn't expect to be a highlight was &quot;Medicine Jar&quot; - but it really stands out as a testament to Wings's ablility to rock like no other.<br />The live version of Listen to What the Man Said is great too - if you have already cast this song aside as too poppy, hold your judgement until you hear Wings do this live.<br />Again, there really isn't a bad track on this album - and it's worth the import price just for &quot;Soily&quot;!!!
0446310786|5.0|I have been reading some of the so-called 'American Classics' and this is one of the few that is actually a great story.  Harper Lee did a great job of developing the main characters and tying in different sub-plots into the main plot.  It was also interesting to read about the southern culture in the 1930's.  The author did a great job painting a picture in the minds of ther readers.  And, of course, there was a positive message about race coming from Atticus and his two children.
B00005JMEW|4.0|I have never been a fan of Uma Thurman's work.  Often times her demure, stone-like prescence in films pushes, not gravitates, me towards her.  Likewise, Quentin Tarantino does not have my regards as being one of the best directors in the last decade or so.  But what Uma and Tarantino do in Kill Bill could have finally changed my mind.  Blending gratuitous violence, stilted-one liner dialogue, and highly stylized cinematography and fighting sequences, Kill Bill is an odd homage to stereotypical Kung Fu era films and spaghetti westerns.<br />A little plot goes a long way for Tarantino in Kill Bill Vol.1.  The Bride (Uma Thurman) is left for dead on her wedding day.  She fell victim to a vicious crew of assassins, and ultimately received a bullet to the head after begging for her own life and that of her unborn child.  Four years later, after awakening from her comatose state, she vows revenge.  So begins her epic journey.<br />The fight sequences in Kill Bill are delicious, spellbinding moments, only stilted by the sometimes VERY UNNECESSARY blood fountains that spray from dead goons severed limbs.  Most engaging are the animated sequences.  They are absolutely gorgeous, and happen to be one of the most poignant spots in this otherwise odd movie.<br />In Vol. 1, viewers are introduced to Vernita Greene (Vivica A. Fox), and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu-in one of her best performances to date.)  Daryl Hannah also has guest appearances, mostly in the form of flashbacks.  Bill Carradine is only shown in snippets, so as to add to his sadistic and cold demeanor.<br />Uma Thurman may appear as an odd choice for such a film.  Interestinly enough, she embraces the role of the Bride, giving the otheriwse obscure woman an identity that you either like or hate.  While Kill Bill is a violent and sometimes silly film, there are plenty of poignant and serious moments that add balance and credibility to the film.  In what could be the best action movie in a long, long, long time, Kill Billmay also be the most violent, and as stated before, this is not always a winning attribute.<br />All in all, Kill Bill is a pleasing action-thriller.  Uma's quiet demeanor, Lucy Liu's ice-cold agenda (she is also given the most background history in the film-animated sequnces and all), and Vivica's blackploitation-like attitude add another dimension to what could have been just another action film with good eye candy.  Kill Vol 2. should be a great ending to odd and at times beautiful film.
0156907399|2.0|Slow isn't necessarily bad, but in this book it was.  I am biased against the `consciousness' style of writing, so my perception of this book was already negative before I started reading it.  The book wasn't too difficult to understand (unlike The Sound and Fury by Faulkner) but it was just plain uninteresting.  William Bankes (a character in the book) said concerning literature \\"let us enjoy what we do enjoy,\\" and I simply did not enjoy Virginia Wolfe's book.
B00005JMEW|1.0|this definitly was not tarintos best movie in fact it was easily his worst i love all of the other quentin movies but this one had suck a horrible plot it was like he just thought a plot so that he good have an excuse to have as much fun as he wants with the action all though i did like the japanese animation part that was very good but as far as the rest of the movie goes you would be much better off buying one of his older films throught out the movie i felt like i had seen this before sadly i cant recall where also i kept feeling like something was missing from the movie like it was a sequel to another movie or something.<br />Basically in the movie uma thurman wakes up from a coma that she was put into after her family was killed at her wedding<br />she kills the janitor who has been raping her while she has been in a coma then she goes finds one of the people who was at the wedding and help kill her family so she kills her then her daughter sees and uma thurman says she was not ment to see that she leaves the house goes to japan to kill another member there she goes to a place where she trains and is equipped with a sword then she goes and kills the jappanneese girl and that is the end of the first movie<br />Everyone is sayiing this review is not helpful but you know what im being blankly honest the movie was terrible and if you dont like what i have to say im sorry im just trying to help people out there who are about to make a bad decision and buy this movie
0684800713|3.0|This book is an account of several characters that are complete losers.  The story never picks up, and the account of people getting drunk continually is uninteresting.  Hemmingway makes use of a lot of dialogue that is sometimes hard to follow.  The one bright spot of the book is the way that the author reveals the culture and landscape of Spain.  He wrote in a way that made the Spanish atmosphere very vivid.  I enjoyed Hemmingway's book, Old Man and the Sea much more than this book.
0446525537|5.0|I don't remember when I have been so emotional over a book. Movies, maybe, but not books. Eventhough this was one of the sadest books I have ever and probably will ever read, I will also keep a copy. The story of the high school couple is so unbelievably sweet and touching. Once you begin reading the book you just have to know what happens. I could not, no matter how hard I tried, put the book down to finish later. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what true love is and/or to anyone who just needs a good cry.
0679879269|5.0|I absolutly LOVED IT!!!!! This is THE best book of like, all time. read it, and you won't regret it. the charecters rock, (especially Will), the plot is SO cool, (especialy the part about the world of the dead), and over all this book rocks, so read it.
B000002TQV|3.0|I just don't see why everyone loves this cd so much! It's an okay album, and would be pretty good for any other rock band, but it's Radiohead... I find every other album so much better. That includes Pablo Honey. I just don't get it. Just when I think a song has the potential to go somewhere cool, it gets screwed up by some awkward interlude or something... Call me crazy, but this is definitely their weakest album. I'm not going to say the worst album, because nothing they touch can be 'bad.' BUT... I don't really like it... Buy OK Computer, Amensiac, Pablo Honey, Hail to the Thief BEFORE you buy this record and judge Radiohead.<br />(...) Now that I've listened to the album more, I'm going to retract my opinions to some extent. I think I was simply unprepared for the very \\"high-end\\" (treble) mix of the whole album. The songs themselves are quite good. I think I'll move my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars... The sound quality just doesn't come close to any of the albums starting with OK Computer.
B00005JMEW|5.0|No other woman could take this role except Uma Thurman. She did brillantly in this. I can't wait to see Vol. 2. The blood in this was great no not great outstanding along with the action sequences. The ending sequence was non-stop fight. It's either kill or be killed and this movie proves it. The music was great along with the film. The story goes like this: Uma Thurman (code name: Black Mambo) is about to get married in El Paso, Texas, but gets shot down by her soon to be hubby Bill and 4 of his Viper Assasins. Uma wakes up 4 years later out of a coma and gets revenge on all those her almost killed her. First on the list is O-Ren-Shii, but you don't see that scene to the very end first you see V. Green at her home get killed. Then Uma gets some of the best japanese steel from a retired sword maker and goes after O-Ren-Shii or whatever her name is and kills all her crew. Uma only kills the two in this film and the rest I suppose in Vol. 2 or maybe even a Vol. 3 I hope. The movie is so fast paced (exciting) that you won't believe it's been 1 hr and 50 mins when it comes to a finish. This is one of years best films along with Vol. 2 even though I haven't seen it. Check it out!
B0000035E7|5.0|This is one case where the legend really precedes the record itself. Cut for about 600 dollars in Jack Endino's studio over just a matter of days, this captures Nirvana at a formative stage, still indebted to the murk that became known as grunge, yet not quite finding their voice as songwriters. Which isn't to say that they were devoid of original material, since even at this stage Kurt Cobain illustrated signs of his considerable songcraft, particularly on the minor-key ballad &quot;About a Girl&quot; and the dense churn of &quot;Blew.&quot; A few songs come close to that level, but that's more a triumph of sound than structure, as &quot;Negative Creep&quot; and &quot;School&quot; get by on attitude and churn, while the cover of &quot;Love Buzz&quot; winds up being one of the highlights because this gives a true menace to their sound, thanks to its menacing melody. The rest of it sinks into the sludge, as the group itself winds up succumbing to grinding sub-metallic riffing that has little power, due to lack of riffs and lack of a good drummer. Bleach is more than a historical curiosity since it does have its share of great songs, but it isn't a lost classic - it's a debut from a band that shows potential but haven't yet achieved it.
0385336810|5.0|This is a great book!!!  I read it in about 1 1/2days and was up until 2:30 in the morning finishing it.  It was so exciting I didn't want to put it down.<br />This book is about a 20 something on her way back from a presentation who spills her guts to the guys sitting next to her on the plane when she thinks they are going to crash.  Though she is embarassed when she realizes what she's done, she figures she won't see him again so it doesn't matter.  Days later Emma finds out that the guy she told her innermost secrets to is the CEO of her company.  <br />This book is as exciting, funny and cativating as the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series.  However, what makes this book even funnier is waiting to find out what secret about Emma that the boss remembers next.  <br />This is a must read and a must own for any book collection.
0440539811|5.0|I have just disovered a book that shall accompany me together with the Wilson/Shea epic wherever I may go - &quot;History: Fiction or Science?&quot; by A. Fomenko, ISBN 2913921023. If &quot;Illuminatus&quot; was the book that made me sceptical about everything I knew about how human society functioned in general, this bombastic historical tractate focuses on exploding the collection of myths that we call human history nowadays. I simply cannot recommend both of them enough.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|this is a horrible poor excuse for an action/war movie.  i've only shut off 3 movies in my whole life without finishing them and this is one of them and i watch plenty of movies, i own over 400 dvds.  the movie appears to be awesome from the previews, but this is a trick to get you to see it.  after watching this for a little over an hour, i wanted to rip my hair out of my head because it was rediculously boring.  i would give this negative stars if i could.  russell crowe is an excellent actor, but hopefully he chooses better roles in the future after this one.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I would rather use my computer, and burn copies of my old videos onto DVD than buy something I never wanted and absolutely despise. Of course, the DVD collection will make Billions more for Lucas Film, forcing him to direct more attrocities, or add special effects to other great movies.  Why doesn't he go back to American Graffiti and add some more tire smoke.  Could improve my viewing pleasure, a little.<BR>    I mean i can't wait to stand in line next MAy for the Blockbuster finaly, and clap and applaud and cheer that he has finished destroying the best work he ever did.<BR>   That is if I don't fall asleep, during the riviting dialogue with utter Brilliant Direction!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Being a huge Bill Murray fan, I went into this movie wanting to love it. In fact, I purchased the movie before we even watched it! I went into it with no expectations except that it was going to be wonderful in an unconventional way. But try as I might, I couldn't like it. I found myself zoning out. My fiance and I discussed it at length, trying to understand why we didn't like it or why we didn't &quot;get it&quot;. Then it hit me - it shouldn't be this hard. Just because some people consider it a great work doesn't mean everyone will. Murray has a few funny lines as you would expect, but the dialogue is extremely limited. A close friend of mine loved the movie because &quot;she knows what it feels like to be lost&quot; - she connected with Scarlett Johansson's character. I'm not sure if that means anything. Very rarely do I watch a movie, especially one so critically acclaimed, and feel as though I've wasted my time.
0385504209|3.0|Sometimes you wonder what makes a book such a best seller.  Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code has some suspense and intrigue.  However the complicated symbols and coding does not come over too clearly.  Also, it relates to a small audience.<br />Furthermore, the character development is mediocre at best.  The reader gets a very basic idea of what makes each character tick.<br />I will admit that the ending is quite creative.  There are a few interesting non-predictable moments as well.  However, the scope seems for fans of mystery and intrigue.  Nonetheless, there must be a lot of fans for that type of novel because this book is selling quite well.
B0000C7GG2|4.0|They are quite something in concert.  Don't miss them as your are going to get more than for what you paid.  Tickets were only $15 CAD but the prestation was worth a lot more.  Lots of light effects in the old days way.  Mattew Bellamy really gives himself in concert, his playing the keyboard with his guitar around the neck because he has to jump between the two and sing on top of that, his singing is not an easy one.  Not a lot of artist would be able to offer such a performance.  I have to say that my boyfriend hates when I put their cd's on (too noisy for him) but he was ravished to see them in concert.<br />Their music is unique, alternatif sometimes hard, sometimes soft and they often includes small piano passage in a way of hard Chopin-Rachmaninoinoff or a dance twist.  Bellamy's voice is from another century very falsetto.<br />Favorite song is &quot;Hysteria&quot; followed by &quot;Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes&quot;, &quot;Time is running out&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse please&quot;.<br />An overall great purchase.
0312263120|1.0|Digital Fortress\\" hints at being a thinking man's technothriller - using codes and human intuition instead of fighter jets and nu-cue-ler subs. Instead, it's full of implausible characters and uninspired plot twists, and worst of all, it never stops reminding you how smart it thinks it is.<br />THE PLOT: a disgruntled/now dead programmer has created a seemingly unbreakable code: \\"Digital Fortress\\", setting off a fierce hunt for its code key. While the key to DF is distributed on the internet, it's encrypted by the DF. Whoever unlocks the code will have access to the ultimate protection against decryption. Hostile governments, organized criminals or terrorists will be able to communicate freely over the internet completely immune to detection. Fearing this, the NSA (the US agency responsible for signals analysis and cracking codes) sends free-lance genius Dave Becker to Seville, where the programmer died. Strathmore, the NSA's head code breaker hopes that DF's creator left some clue to the code key behind. Unfortunately, Becker isn't alone on his hunt... <BR>Meanwhile, back at the NSA's high-tech HQ, Susan Fletcher, our hero's brilliant and sexy NSA genius of a girlfriend, tries picking up the mystery from her end of the Atlantic, where TRNSLTR, Strathmore's newest codebreaking supercomputer, is busy melting itself down trying to crack DF. Unfortunately, it looks like somebody is after Susan's as well - from the inside - and we get the hint that she shouldn't feel as safe as she does when Strathmore is around. Back in Spain, Becker quickly learns that DF's creator had worn a ring when he died - but it's missing. Quickly guessing that inscriptions on the ring say more than \\"one ring to rule them all\\", our hero tracks it across Spain, learning how quickly it moves from owner to owner. Unfortunately, whoever owns the ring (even briefly) is marked for death by a mysterious assassin - a deaf killer who never misses, and catalogs his kills on a Palm Pilot. <br />HOWEVER: This novel was horrible at just about every level, lacking in style or substance. It's not only strikingly unintelligent, but strikingly arch. To read \\"Fortress\\", you'd think Brown learned more about cryptography and the NSA than most people cared to hear about, and thus crafted a novel based on his \\"insider\\" info about cryptography. (Brown's story heavily relies on a perceived ignorance of what the NSA stands for - an agency, he writes, that only a small percentage of Americans understand. Rather than showing that Brown is a writer who has learnt what most us can't, \\"Digital Fortress\\" proves that Brown focuses on remote subjects not likely to have a large number of experts who can effectively challenge his pretensions of realism.) Actually, I learned more about cryptography while writing a paper about the Walker Family Spy Ring in high school, and most will probably learn more about the NSA watching \\"Sneakers\\" or \\"Good Will Hunting\\". How do you like them apples?) Instead of intelligent clues, Brown's story builds on arcane trivia (the etymology of the word \\"sincere\\", certain technical details distinguishing the different a-bombs used against Japan). I was able to piece together some of Brown's clues, not because I'm smarter than most, but simply because I watch a lot of the History channel. <br />Getting past the \\"thrill\\" and \\"techno\\" aspects of the story, what's left is thin - Brown's ring-plot provides an excuse to send our hero across Seville, hunting the ring, making this less of a novel of any genre than a college-writing version of \\"Where I Went Last Summer\\" (complete with Spanish dialog repeated in English). <br />Brown's thin story is plumped, not with some redeeming characters of depth and intelligent plot turns, but with unbelievably stupid characters and unbelievable plot twists. Our hero is no action hero (he stays in shape playing racquetball), yet he manages to elude the hitman who has carved a path of precision-guided death across Seville. Susan is beautiful and brilliant - though Brown never leaves us doubting as to which half matters more (Susan is probably the least independent, most vulnerable, unintelligent and otherwise dated female character I've seen in any technothriller; even her smarts are just a convenient device to explain why she's working with the NSA.) Strathmore is supposed to be a cryptographer par excellence, yet he defies belief - he's so obsessed with DF that he rams it into his priceless super-codebreaking computer, bypassing security checks meant to protect it from viruses. He does this despite knowing that DF is obviously more than it appears (its code for heaven's sake!!). There's another NSA co-worker, a guy who's supposed to set off our alarm bells, but it's obvious that Brown only means him to distract us from Strathmore since Brown couldn't be bothered to come up with more characters. Like Strathmore, the rest of the denizens of NSA headquarters are so dim, it's inconceivable that they'd be trusted to run a third rate ISP, let alone the most sophisticated code-breaking computer in the world. (Typical for low-grade technothrillers, Brown is so obsessed credentialing his characters as geniuses, he devotes little time to writing them even slightly smart.  They're stellar when it facing Brown's artificial plot challenges, but in common sense terms, Beavis and Butthead would eat these guys for lunch).<br />By the climax, I couldn't care whether the NSA would be destroyed by the killer code, mostly because the author had by then changed from telling a story to giving a pitch for some splashy action movie, making the novel's Hollywood aspirations annoyingly clear. In short, storm some other fortress.
B00004SVID|5.0|This cd changed my mind about the wall and made me like it alot more it is all played perfectly and usually with some really creative instrumental additions to the studio. I rate the regular wall a 4 but this cd is a 5 because its much more emotional, songs like The Thin Ice,Mother,One of my Turns, Vera and many more all have a much stronger force to them.I would much rather have this if i could only have one but you need both. Happiest days of our life is the low point of this cd but its not a bad version its great its just the lyrics aren't as insane sounding and not as much of a hook for Another Brick Pt.2 which is performed wonderfully as is Pt.1. David Gilmour plays unbelievably throughout. Run Like Hell is probably the most outstanding along with Hey You ,Comfartably Numb and Young Lust.Mostly Daves works stand out to me but don't forget about Roger Waters He is who makes Run Like Hell complete along with many many many of his original peices. I'm not sure but I think the CD gives all the credit to Roger for producing it even though Dave gave a huge effort along with Rick Wright and Nick Mason (during the years they toured the wall Roger Waters had became an egomaniac and wanted compelte control of the bands direction and actually kicked out Nick and Rick, they did play most of the songs on here impressively)His contribution to the album was undeniably brilliant nonetheless Also this is the only post ummagumma live cd featuring all post syd barret days members so it is a must have for any kind of listener.The only other live cds that i enjoy this much is Led Zeppelin's-How The West Was Won or maybe P.U.L.S.E. or One More From The Road<BR>5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I just love american life from the first track American life to the last. Madonna has really taken the listener for a ride with each song. I love love profusion it is a great song and could be anyone wedding song I think it that good! Nothing Fails reminds me of two of her other hits into one song. Die another day just has to be one of the best Madonna tunes to day. Hollywood is a good car ride song. American life is one of thoes songs that you need to listen to again to understand what Madonna is talking about.<br />That is all for now. Long Live The Queen!
B00005JLXE|5.0|Don't let negative critics fool you. The Daredevil movie IS based on the comic and Kingpin IS a Daredevil villain. Some people just don't know what they are talking about. You can buy great graphic novels and collections of Daredevil back issues from Amazon and see that Kingpin IS in the pages of Daredevil. There are many many moments inspired by the books and that's impressive. Give it a look and don't believe just what the ignorant have to say.
B0000019PA|5.0|this album is not about being a great singer. this album is not about being a great guitarist. its not about being complex or knowing things about song structers. it is certainly not about having to get used to it. and its not about living up to hype. this is not a progressive rock cd. jeff mangum has a special talent of being able to move you with an acoustic guitar, three chords, and a voice that is \\"not all that impressive\\". of course this isnt true for everyone, i suppose. if you find yourself unable to understand its because this kind of talent is not easily measurable. you dont recognize jeff mangums talent in the same way you recogize that someone is a great singer, or a great guitarst. it's much deaper than that. this is one of the greatest PEICES OF ART of our time. everything isnt always about how hard something has to be. this album is simple and sweet. its genius and abusrd. its crude and sophisticated. its everything that makes not just a good album, but a good feeling. the fact is, jeff mangum could say more with an elastic band and strep throat than cedric bixler could ever say with 30 of the greatest musicians who ever lived and 10 thousand voice enhancers.
0385336810|3.0|In the fashion of the Shopaholic books, this one was addictive, easy and quick to read, and had a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud... and recieving strange looks from people around me... oh well! My greatest qualm with this one however, was the amount of language. There was an excessive amount of swearing, which was fortunately not seen as much in the Shopaholic books. It often distracted from the story and was rather unnecessary in most cases. For this reason, I am hestitant to recommend it to a number of my friends. <BR>So if you are put-off by foul language, stick to the Shopaholic books. If you can get past it, the story is quite humorous, albeit not quite as up to par as her previous works. I would give it 3 and a half stars, if the choice was available.
B00008DDXC|3.0|Choose &quot;Wide Screen&quot; or the &quot;Pan and Scan&quot; version?  Here is some help: For the most part in any DVD, the Wide Screen or &quot;Letterbox&quot; version is supposed to &quot;PRESERVE&quot; the aspect version that you saw at the movies. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; versions were probably filmed using 1.18:1 aspect ratio, but Warner Bros Pictures used a 2.35:1 aspect ratio to transfer to the widescreen DVD.  This is good for the new widescreen tvs, but, this also cheats you out of this movies' integrety; whereas it deletes both the top and bottom portions of the original film. Some movies are SHOT in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and you usually do not lose anything with those - (why couldn't they just do the 1.18:1 aspect ratio as it was meant to be seen?) For purists, it's fine for the new television monitors and tvs, but I would prefer the full top to bottom view of the actors and things that they are holding and the hand movements. <br />The TV or the &quot;Full Screen&quot; version, (Still not 1.18:1 aspect ratio), was meant to fit on a regular TV screen. Here, little portions are lost in the left side of the film. I prefer to take the little loss on the sides versus losing the top and bottom, showing clapping, wand holding, etc to be seen, so skip the widescreen and purchase the &quot;Full Screen&quot; version if that is what you want.  Either way, the movie is a PIP!
0061015725|3.0|The paperback cover quotes the New York Times Book review in part \\"Terrifying . . .irresistibly suspenseful.\\" Indeed, the story Michael Crichton spins has elements of terror and at times the suspense grabs hold of the reader and does not let go. <br />A tale of science run amuck on the tracks of greed and stupidity. Crichton mixes an old formula with new science.<br />The finish is written as if the Crichton has a deadline to meet. Definitely, unsatisfying for a Michael Crichton read. <br />Fortunately, for the reader, a bad Crichton book is better than most other authors seem able to generate on a good day.<br />Reduce your expectations and the book will be satisfying.

Nothing is as good as the book, (your own imagination is used there), but the movie does give some nice escape in imagination with some excellent acting and computer gra-fix!
0156027321|2.0|&quot;I have a story that will make you believe in God.&quot;  This is the presumptive theme of the book.  But reader beware.  After you have navigated Pi's fantastic South Seas adventure, the narrator will slap you in the face with a very different theme:  &quot;which story do you prefer?&quot;; or in other words, God is good precisely because he is a fabulous relief from vile humanity.<br />If yours is a postmodern devotion, then you will enjoy this book from beginning to end. You probably also enjoyed Umberto Ecco's &quot;Island of the Day Before.&quot;<br />Otherwise, you're likely to finish the book feeling disappointed after you skim through it, or manipulated if you read for meaning.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I mean the title of this review literally.  I watched it while I was scanning a book for a publisher, and it was a good minor distraction from the mechanical drudgery of picking and placing paper into the scanner, since there wasn't that much plot to follow, so if I missed anything, it didn't matter.<br />The movie opens with a commentary by &quot;Selene&quot;, a &quot;Death Dealer&quot; mentioning &quot;Lycans&quot; and a &quot;war&quot;, and the next two thirds of the picture are essentially Matrix-style gunfights and chases, peppered with occasional respites when the director and scriptwriter seem to run out of &quot;Ok, what can we shoot at or blow up next?&quot; ideas.<br />After about two-thirds of the picture, you finally get to find out what's actually going on, who is fighting whom, and why the previous hour-and-fifteen-minutes of bang-bang-boom-boom has been happening.  By that time, you may not care.<br />Cinematically, it's &quot;Matrix&quot; meets &quot;Clothing by Leather Masters&quot;, shot in a uniformly gray-blue color scheme that leaves every battlefield in the movie looking like every other.<br />The only saving grace in this whole pointless and uninvolving exercise are the shots of Kate Beckinsale's face.  She's a superb actress, emotes well, and has a face which would haunt the dreams of a Renaissance painter or sculptor.<br />My advice: Rent once, rinse from memory, and don't bother with the sequel.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Jaws has something for everyone. It has a bit of the classic disaster movies of the 70s like \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" and \\"The Towering Inferno.\\" It has a bit of the classic Hitchcock suspense films like \\"Psycho\\" and \\"The Birds.\\" It has a bit of the teen B-movie slasher flicks. It's a buddy picture. It's a road trip movie. Now a lot of directors could take these elements and make a lousy movie, but Spielberg turned it into Hollywood gold.<br />The casting and character development in the movie are excellent. Robert Shaw's Quint, especially, is unbelievably good as the salty shark-hunter. His monologue about the USS Indianapolis demonstrates in a couple minutes the depth of his character who, prior to that scene, was almost a caricature (the quote in the title of this review is an example of his charming wit). Dreyfuss and Scheider also create characters with nuanced depth. Spielberg even takes Murray Hamilton's character, Mayor Vaughn, who at first seems shallow and smarmy (\\"Amity, as you know, means friendship\\") and in the hospital scene transforms him into a real person.<br />Included on the DVD is an excellent documentary looking at the making of the movie, which does a great job at spreading credit for the film's success beyond just Steven Spielberg, as well as throwing in a lot of filmmaking trivia. The other extras on the DVD are a mixed bag. The deleted scenes are worth watching, though appropriately deleted from the final version. The outtakes were a disappointment (you'd think Roy Scheider would have test-fired the gun after it jammed the second time). The trivia game is nice once through. The Windows screensaver amounts to 5 still images (most of them mediocre) from the movie that endlessly repeat. A commentary or two would have been great ... maybe for the 30th anniversary.<br />Jaws was one of those movies that was an instant hit and continues to impress. It's still in the Top 30 box office draws (even ahead of Monsters Inc., Batman, and Men in Black) -and with good reason: it's simply an excellent movie. If you've never seen it before, you're missing a thrill (literally). If you have seen it, but don't have it on DVD already, get it now; it doesn't disappoint.
B00005OM4N|3.0|this album is ok, not like the last 2 and some of the tracks are kinda cheesy.
B00005JMUA|3.0|Okay, QT's onscreen loveletter to Uma Thurman has reached it's conclusion.  Not a very epic one though.  I think that most people who enjoyed the first installment will not like this one as much.  Those who didn't like the first one at all might like it, but probably not.<br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie.  The acting was top-notch and Uma should definatley get a nod at Oscar time.  The influence of many types of genres is evident and fun to watch.  The sparse action is great when it happens.  But I left the theater feeling gyped somehow.  The dialog had it's good parts, but much of it didn't seem to pertain to the movie or go anywhere.  And there is so much of it.  If you are execting the wit and satire that harkens back to Reservior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, it really isn't there.  And the climax of the movie...well, it was a bit anti-clamatic.<br />Kill Bill Vol.2 isn't a terrible movie, it just doesn't live up to it's potential.  It is a suitible companion to Vol. 1, but you just can't help but think that if he mixed the elements of the 2 movies together a bit more, a great whole would have been the result.
B00004SCX6|5.0|this has got style, class (...). the tracks oops...i did it again, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know, Stronger, Lucky, One kiss from you, when your eyes say it give the album the touch of collector's edition to this hot album
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie about drugs? SO sad to see that viewers dont know how to read a metaphor, it is as much about drugs as it is about prostitution, criminality, exploitation of labour, commerciality, etc., they're all in the movie and yet they do not define it. <br />The ample reference movie makes to drug abuse is a metaphor for the hallucinatory &quot;systematic destruction of hope&quot;. Capitalism is a system of ghosts: the more it destroys the inner human the more it displays a mirrage of dreams of happiness. Every dream has its dark side, folks, and every nightmare has its dreamlike nature. Dont forget that for all the happy faces you see on television, lottery winners etc. there are those who decay in utter despair, and for  all the dregs of the underworld, there are those who live on top of empire buildings.<br />If &quot;Leaving Las vegas&quot; portrays the suicide on the individual level, &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; is the suicide on the collective one. And this is not about just a bunch of drug addicts, our whole society is rushing blindfolded to a horrifying end.
B000002H2H|5.0|I know that is alot to say of a cd; and that a 5 stars must signify excellence. All is true of this cd. I know most say that Master Of Puppets and And Justice For All are better, but I find this cd more rewarding. While M.O.P. was heavy and A.J.F.A intricate, I felt that R.T.L. combined both aspects. It was heavy yet melodic. The boys really sounded well on this album-they also sounded good on the other two aforementioned cds mind you- but this cd had alot of heart. While there are only 8 songs on this disc, it still manages to feel like an eternity. I HIGHLY recommend this cd for your introduction into Metallica, or for your next cd purchase. All of the songs are just fantastic, but, in my opinion, the following are standout tracks:<br />For Whom The Bell Tolls<BR>Ride The Lightning<BR>Fade to Black<BR>Creeping Death<BR>Trapped Under Ice<BR>Fight Fire with fire<br />That is pretty much the whole cd. The other two songs are all right in my opinion, and are worthy of a listen to every time. I highly recommend this to any rock fan and metal fan. I also recommend any release before their self-titled release.
B0001VWP8I|4.0|Anastacia in the past has released some absolutely brilliant music. She has a unique voice and so much talent that she is fast becomming one of if not my favourite artist.<br />I have seen her perform live and she has been in tune for every song (6 or so).  This is hard for any artist and in the past i have never been dissapointed with any of her song choices on her albums.  Sure i may not have really liked them but there are never any which i flick past.<br />When i heard about this new album i was a bit sceptical.  First off i have not heard a brilliant album since delta goodrems - innocent eyes (if you dont know who she is, you will soon :). Secondly i thought it was going to go in the same direction as so many artist these days (do we need another rnb/hip hop album?)   <br />The songs:<BR>1. Seasons Change:<BR>Great vocals here and a nice beat, use of guitar and drums are good and dont overwhelm her vocals.        <BR>2. Left Outside Alone:<BR>The single and song that made me want to listen to the album.  The only really poppy song which i think is a good thing.      <BR>3. Time:<BR>Interesting and a good mix of electronica and vocals. Could be a catchy song if listened to more.     <BR>4. Sick & Tired<BR>I think she makes great use of her voice here and her new style is really comming out in this song.        <BR>5. Heavy On My Heart <BR>Somewhat of a ballad, very slow song but a great one at that.       <BR>6. I Do Feat Sonny from pod.    <BR>Makes use of sunny great and definately a great song.    <BR>7. Welcome To My Truth <BR>Interesting song, not one of the best but definately still good by todays standards.       <BR>8. Pretty Little Dum Dum  <BR>Very interesting intro (never heard anything like it).  Vocals here are different which is good.     <BR>9. Sexy Single   <BR>I can relate to this song so well so this is already one of my favs.     <BR>10. Rearview  <BR>Definate winner.  She has made another winner with this song and i love it.<BR>11. Where Do IBelong  <BR>Another sentimental song.  This is about battles and i like its beat.      <BR>12. Maybe Today  <BR>Piano is used well here.  Not one of her best but brilliant by todays standards.<br />I think this album bar none is the best we have seen this year.  It has a fresh feel and steers clear of rnb (thank god).  I am a fan of Anastacia and love her new album.  I think it has something on there for everyone (or anyone who has been through tough situations in life.)  <br />While the songs may not be poppy as such or catchy (there are quite a few mind you.) this will do well simply for the fact she has done something totally different to everyone else and has created a new album which will make an impact in an oversatuated market.  <br />I would give it 4.9/5.  While its nearly perfect there is always something to improve on.  This is her 3rd album and while i cant say if its her best it is definately suited to her.  I think she has taken a group of songs which would have bombed under britney, christina or any of the other miriad of barbie clones (i do like these artists but am starting to want something different) she has made them great.
B00005JLYW|3.0|(...)It is true it is not Academy Award winning material but then it was never intended to be. It is funny, action packed, sexy and fast paced. The movie doesn't rock your world but it is certainly worth watching. Besides it is getting old listening to people complaining about scenes and stunts that are \\"impossible\\" or \\"things that could never happen in real life\\". Entertainment is not real life, it was never meant to be. Get over it.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem was somewhat of an unknown quantity up until 2002.  This darling of the Australian music scene swept the aria awards (like the grammys) grabbing 6 of the 7 awards she was up for and only getting pipped by the absolutely great band powderfinger.<br />The tracks on this album are not only unique but each one tells a different chapter of her life like you are reading a book and trust me you do not want to put this book down.  I love this artist so much that not only am i sure she is already a star, she will be the biggest star Australia has ever.<br />She has had 5 number one singles and is about to release her 6th.  Not only is she going to be huge internationally she will bring back the type of music we all love.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I had Kill Bill recommended to me by almost everyone I knew who saw it. So naturally I was really hyped to see it when it came out on DVD (because I don't like paying $9.50 for a freaking movie viewing). The action scenes were good, but there were a few things that were just wrong with this movie. First there are the little things that were wrong it. For example, when Uma's character was flying to Japan, did anyone else notice that she was holding a 40 inch sword? WHILE ON AN AIRPLANE!? C'mon people I realize that this was suppose to be unrealistic, it is an action movie after all, but thats just stupid. Also, why does she magically have a sporty motorcycle with matching yellow custom fitted leather outfits, right after getting off the plane? Then there are the big things that were wrong that they kept doing over and over, like the blood. The blood was ridiculously overdone. When someones limbs and/or head was chopped off, a  cartoonish, 3 or 4 foot gyser would erupt from the freshy inflicted wound. Stupid. And then not forget the random crap they just threw in for no apparent reason. Like the gross, sadistic, ugly looking 5 minute aimation scene in which Lucy Lui's parents are brutally murdered in front of her. Also, there are 3 fight scenes in the entire movie. One in the beginning, and a huge one at the end. The one in the middle is too short and is in anime. Stupid. The movie is just not well constructed. In between the beginning fight scene and the one in the end the movie is downright boring. It's filled with choppy storytelling and random flashbacks. Maybe it was just to overdone for me, but personally I didn't care for it much.
B00006RU5B|5.0|...for a time anyway.<br />I heard the first track off this album last summer in Oslo Norway.  I was half watching videos, half getting dressed/drunk in my hotel room.<br />The video for &quot;Show me how to live&quot; blew my musical stack.  Insanely good rock, fast cars, thermal undershirts, fire...I totally had to change my outfit (wore some kind of rockish leather number to Olodum, one of Oslo's most famous outdoor restaurants in the summertime)...and then later shaved my goatee in favor of what Chris Cornell has (which is kind of like a vertical moustache extending from the bottom lip in a straight line then fanning out in a frenzy at around chin depth).  Anyway, that config. didn't work out well for my taste, but this CD did.<br />I just read a three star review for this CD!  MADNESS!  5 stars doesn't mean perfect, it means excellent.  There are a few &quot;decent&quot; songs on this album, but every other song is good, and a few are insanely good!  My favorites are:<br />&quot;Show me how to live&quot;...cost me a goatee, but was worth the several kilograms of adrenaline repeated play has pumped me with.<br />&quot;What you are&quot;...I love when Chris gets angry.  I love it more when he gets angry about love.  This is a fantastic breakup song to smash S@#! to.  If you're into that kinda thing.<br />&quot;I am the Highway&quot;...Hauntingly beautiful rock song.  Lots of airplay so I won't describe.<br />&quot;Getaway Car&quot;...This turned out to be my favorite track on the CD.  Probably the best display of Chris' unparalled vocal talent.<br />And those are just the songs I consider amazing.  This CD is a wonderful choice for anyone who loves rock, but mandatory if you loved Soundgarden.<br />Hope this helped...
0316921173|4.0|I painfully remember those thick bodacious books of the 1970s that I labored through as if on a chain gang: those capacious fictions which were a contemporary answer to Joyce, Proust, Mann, and Musil. When these books of genius emerged, people were rightly afraid. A disturbed person could kill someone with this weapon called a thousand-plus page book : John Barth was a little before my time, but Thomas Pynchon wrote these types of books that were actually best sellers (his bloated-ness included comedy, and hip academics jumped on board), and Gilbert Sorrentino came through at decade's end with the brilliant Mulligan's Stew, a novel about a novelist writing a novel, with a play and assorted journals. Anything but a good old story. These inflated novels included everything, but the readers of the 1980s were not so friendly to these sorts of self-conscious fiction. When David Foster Wallace writes, &quot;It's funny what you don't recall&quot; in the new book, he's pulling our legs. Only if he didn't remember.<br />I am thinking now of the genre's swan song of Alexander Theroux and Joseph McElroy. Theroux's Darconville's Cat, an encyclopedic love story and study in misogyny, was a heavily promoted book, and eventually died on the bookshelves. I sense that Henry Holt's belated reissue plans have not went so well due to that reason. McElroy's Women and Men had a similar push, plenty of reviews and essays, but little sales. Readers rebelled against the genius writer. Ten years later, hardly anyone can remember who McElroy is. Even Pynchon was smart enough to produce a short novel after many years in obscurity.<br />Just think for a minute about the few novels in the past few years that have received serious literary appreciation; most of them clock in under 300 pages: Nicholson Baker, Rick Moody, Stephen Dixon, Philip Roth, Suzanna Moore, etc.  The general consensus would be that anything more is pretentious, an act of stretching what should be condensed. Even in the wake of highly technological advances, readers expectations have been damaged by impatience. Even yours truly can't sit still!<br />Which brings us to Infinite Jest. Wallace has been artistically silent for many years. So has Jay McInerny. If you don't count Wallace's half-baked tell-all about rap music, Signifying Rappers , his last book of stories, Girl With Curious Hair, was more than six years ago. So when his new book came in I was immediately concerned with the size: Could I commit two weeks of my life to such a book? Such demands are heavy duty and only the most religious could give up their lives of TV watching and Lollapalooza attending. I cracked open this massive tome, with almost 400 footnotes (some obtrusive), and the book hurt my arms and after reading a few pages, my neck began to hurt.  I remember years before, how I read the first 100 pages of Women and Men about four times before I abandoned it entirely.<br />I thought it odd that a writer like Wallace, who has relied so heavily on TV, now expects me, the reader, to sit down at a desk, and actually slow down my novel-reading habits.  As I studied Infinite Jest, a novel plotless and expansive, it turns out best read in an interior mental voice that sounds like a pedagogic and fat lecturer. Once this verbal tick is assumed it's easier to follow the over-analysed obsessed monologues, the hundred-odd characters, mostly centered around a drug rehab halfway house in Boston and a group of tennis players, one named Harold Incadenza of the Enfield Tennis Academy. The history of tennis is mixed up with drugs, chemicals, activity in Quebec, and Phoenix, Arizona.  What the book is inevitably, cannot be regurgitated, but only experienced. Eventually Wallace has written another heady book about solipsism and alienation. What a downer!  In conclusion, this is a daring book, and I don't know if it will attract any readers. Looks like there's another Titanic on the horizon! All the best of luck to you, sailor!<br />Endnotes:<br />(1)Infinite Jest is 1079 pages. Good luck!<br />(2)One wonders what was actually cut from the book, if any material?<br />(3)Rumors about the next Pynchon book is that it is short and Beckett-like.<br />(4)Several of the authors that I have interviewed: Mark Leyner, Martin Amis, Mary Gaitskill, Rikki Ducornet, Lynne Tillman, and so on.<br />(5)I couldn't imagine sitting down and reading a good old 19th century novel by Dickens or Thackerey. I have heard about people dedicated years to Proust. (Ha!)<br />(6)I guess that Wallace was too white to have known about Dolomite.<br />(7)Among book reviewers the hand signal of &quot;two inches&quot; width made with thumb and forefinger has come to signify &quot;That Wallace guy has written one thick book!&quot;<br />(8)When I finally finished W&amp;M a few years ago, I felt ripped off. The characters never meet. I think that's McElroy's achievement: To have readers invest in you and rip them off.<br />(9)Wallace is the master of the endnote. Thanks to Microsoft. I guess that they're supposed to be like TV commercials.<br />(10)In fact, this book reminds me of Vineland, by Thomas Pynchon, as it does of McElroy. Well, at least Wallace is ambitious, I'll give him that.<br />(11)Wallace always had disappointing women characters.<br />(12)I don't want to give the impression that this is an unworthy book. It is a challenging book, but as readers there are few risk takers left. Wallace is an important writer, no doubt. I just don't want him writing me any more angry letters for my opinions. So what: I find his depiction of Los Angeles to be of minor interest whereas when he writes of the Midwest, it is always intelligent and interesting./>Endnotes:<br />(1)Infinite Jest is 1079 pages.

B000003S5H|5.0|I heard a bunch of wonderful things about Air through the musical grapevine and in reviews such as this one, it wasn't until I bought the CD and listened that two things were confirmed:<br />1.  This is among the best ambient music CD's of our time; and<br />2.  I'd been listening to this CD for years.<br />As it turns out, the owner of a local lounge (Blue Agave in Santa Barbara CA.) has had it on rotation for the last few years.  I'd been intoxicated (literally and figuratively) to (and by) this music for quite some time now standing outside on their little patio, drinking, smoking, carousing...<br />I usually like to call out certain songs on CD's I review as noteworthy.  I won't in this case however because every track is excellent.  They did a wonderful job stitching their arrangement too, each track, while different, blend seemlessly into each other.<br />Unlike allot of ambient music, this CD will chill you out, lift your mood, but won't put you to sleep.  I'm sure this was by design....a noteworthy accomplishment in that unlike the equivalent to musical smelling salt, whenever a faster paced track comes on, it doesn't offend with overly loud or obnoxious beats.<br />If you love this album, consider trying a few other similar artists.  The first one that leaps to mind is Zero 7.  Their new album &quot;When it Falls&quot; is a brilliant and similar comparable.  Another wonderful new talent is Solar House, they have a newer CD called &quot;Magic of the City&quot; that is a bit more upbeat, but still very seductive and ambiance friendly...<br />Hope this was helpful.<br />Enjoy.
B000006045|5.0|It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening \\"Angel\\" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!
0312995423|3.0|It's not a bad read, but many situtations were fairly predicatable.  That kind of elimated some of the suspense.
0425098478|4.0|The issue is that most of the managers are not effective.<br />The conclusion is that if you use the One Minute technique, you can become very effective.<br />The One Minute technique is:<BR>One Minute Goal setting- Take time to set major goals as that the employee knows what needs to be done.<BR>One Minute Praising- Praise your employees by catching them doing the RIGHT thing<BR>One Minute Reprimand- First reprimand the BEHAVIOR, Second encourage the PERSON (shake hands)<br />There are examples given to explain each point.<br />This books is a bestseller because of it's simplicity. But subsequent books by the authors have acknowledged the need of more than the above 3 items.<br />It is good in theory but it's practice demands much more.
1592400876|4.0|A great way to begin investigating the more subtle rules governing punctuation.  It will probably not make you an expert, but will give you the tools you need to start practicing to become one.  <br />The author is terrific.  It's as though you've got your very own witty English schoolteacher guiding you while you read.  I would recommend this book to anyone just starting out (like me) or to anyone looking for a refresher course.  <br />Although there are some subtle differences between the rules for the US and UK, the author makes a point of providing examples of how things differ.  <br />This is the type of book you can refer to later on; it provides numerous examples of proper usage, and is organized in a way that makes it easy to access the rules you would like to review.<br />A funny, fast, and informative read.  I really enjoyed it.
B0000942EX|4.0|On the one hand \\"A Passion Play\\" is clearly attempt by Jethro Tull's eccentric leader Ian Anderson to recapture the heights the group reached with their \\"Thick as a Brick\\" album. While the final judgment would have to be close but no cigar, this is still one of the better Tull albums. I have always found the parallels between the \\"story\\" and the Passion of Christ to be somewhat forced at best, but Anderson likes to be pretentious and enigmatic whenever possible when it comes to his lyrics (is Anderson supposed to be a fallen angel at one point?).  The album was conceived for live performance, which included a short film of the album cover ballerina in action and the strange little interlude of \\"The Hair Who Lost His Spectacles\\" (In a nice touch for those who caught the \\"Passion Play\\" tour back in 1973 the video track for \\"The Story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\" is included as well on this CD).<br /><br />The story, if you want to call it such, is about a man who has just died and at the gates of heaven is reviewing his life.  What he realizes is that life on Earth is better than an eternity in paradise.  As always, there is the hodge-podge of musical influences with flamenco thrown in with the classical, blues, jazz, folk and rock we came to expect from Tull. This is certainly the most pretentious album from Anderson's fertile mind, which is why it ends up being less of a success than \\"Thick as a Brick.\\" The less you listen to the lyrics and try to work out the message, the more you will enjoy the music and the album. The problem, of course, is that Anderson does not really want you tuning out the lyrics and the \\"plot\\" of the album.<br /><br />For those who have always been wondering what the titles of the individual \\"songs\\" in this organic work are called, I offer you the following list for what it is worth:<br /><br />1. Lifebeats<br />2. Prelude<br />3. The Silver Cord<br />4. Re-Assuring Tune<br />5. Memory Bank<br />6. Best Friends<br />7. Critique Oblique<br />8. Forest Dance #1<br />9.

B00000JCOV|1.0|Nu-metal is such a terrible form of art...I cant stand it & hopefully it will die along with rap & pop music! Im some one who respects ppls taste and if you like nu-metal  or rap or pop its alright even tho it sucks but hey it's you \\"thing\\" but i just dont see how you can like it.Anyways,(...)let's start off with their music which isn't realy good because they do not have any talent, to begin with...I mean, 9 ppl ? (...)If you need people in your band that show weakness!All & all aside from the queer  masks which isn't even scary looking to be honest they all p***y looking gayish mask!The music right ?From the first track to the last its basically  boring,not heavy, repetetivy, & Corey's vocals are horrible he can't sing or scream good its not even close to being brutal. Skip this and go for bands like scar culture,napalmdeath,mortician,cannibal corpse,theredchord,dillinger escapeplan,,killswitch engage, cephalic carnage,krisiun, & others. The latest shai hulud & burnt by the sun are pretty amazing!
B00003CXI1|4.0|Choose \\"Wide Screen\\" or the \\"Pan and Scan\\" version?  Here is some help: For the most part in any DVD, the Wide Screen or \\"Letterbox\\" version is supposed to \\"PRESERVE\\" the aspect version that you saw at the movies. \\"Harry Potter\\" versions were probably filmed using 1.18:1 aspect ratio, but Warner Bros Pictures used a 2.35:1 aspect ratio to transfer to the widescreen DVD.  This is good for the new widescreen tvs, but, this also cheats you out of this movies' integrity; whereas it deletes both the top and bottom portions of the original film. Some movies are SHOT in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and you usually do not lose anything with those - (why couldn't they just do the 1.18:1 aspect ratio as it was meant to be seen?) For purists, it's fine for the new television monitors and tvs, but I would prefer the full top to bottom view of the actors and things that they are holding and the hand movements.     The TV or the \\"Full Screen\\" version, (Still not 1.18:1 aspect ratio but shows the bowl being pushed on the table by Hagrid), was meant to fit on a regular TV screen. Here, little portions are lost in the left side of the film. I prefer to take the little loss on the sides versus losing the top and bottom, showing clapping, wand holding, etc to be seen, so skip the widescreen and purchase the \\"Full Screen\\" version if that is what you want.  Either way, the movie is a PIP! I thought that the essence of mystery mixed with human emotion is nicely portrayed.  Nothing is as good as the book, (your own imagination is used there), but the movie does give some nice escape in imagination with some excellent acting and computer gra-fix!
B000006TRV|5.0|I have been a Floyd fan for almost a year now. I got Dark Side of the Moon, Division Bell, Wish you were here, and ummagumma. I got the Wall about one month ago, and it is tied with DSOTM for my fav Pink Floyd cd. Every time I listen to the Wall i go on a headtrip, and have these images and colours fly through my mind. Comfortably Numb is definetly my favorite Floyd song, the guitar solo is legendary. Young Lust and Run Like Hell are runners up. Currently though, I've been hooked on The Trial, I love the dialouge, and then when it gets all heavy, its so trippy. I recomend this album to anyone who doesn't have it, if you are a Floyd fan, or not, this is a great album. it is worth the $40.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS tells the story of a family: four girls and one boy that contains little to no sibling rivalry. The family seems to be multi-talented and the only crisis is when the upper middle class family almost moves from St. Louis to New York, even though the viewer knows the family will never leave the beloved city. The older children have love interests, but there is only a limited amount of romantic fireworks. Still, the movie is magical. Viewers believe a happy family such as the Smiths exists and that life is as happy as it can be in 1903/04 St. Louis. Why? Because MGM with its arsenal of great stars and gifted production teams creates this magical world. Given that this film was first released in 1945, it was just what the world needed at the time. It still has magic today.<br />Since most people who will purchase this film will love all the extras that come with DVD's, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS will not disappoint. Liza Minelli introduces the set (her mother is the star and her father the director). There is a commentary by Garland's biographer John Fricke and co-star Margaret O'Brien as well as a making of the film and trailers from Vincente Minelli films. All great extras for the movie and trivia buff.<br />Enjoy!
B000002HMH|2.0|This album was definetly the low point of Metallica's career, even though Reload isn't no better. So much crappy songs on here with 4 or 5 good ones. Until it sleeps, Hero of the day, king nothing, cure, thorn within, and Outlaw Torn, are sweet tracks, but the rest suck. I thought the house jack built was Metallicas worst song ever. The vocal solo is so stupid, and the lyrics suck. Mama said and bleeding me are ok. Get AJFA, RTL, KEA, and MOP before this one, yikes.
B00000I8UF|5.0|You cannot deny how great this record is. This is THE record that got me into jazz 5 years ago and ever since, i have been hunting down every Blue Note albums. Moanin is highly recommended. Get this now !
B000002TPS|5.0|Youthanasia was the very first Megadeth album i got, and it is definetly on my top 5 fav studio albums by Megadeth. Its a heavy album, with aggresive tunes, although it is not as thrsahy as previous albums, but still very melodic, and heavy. Heres the rundown of the songs:<br />1.Reckoning Day - 5/5 - A powerful opener, with a cool song setup, solos here and there, nice little fillers.<BR>2.Train of Consquences - 5/5 - Sweet guitar part, and catchy chorus, with awesome solo.<BR>3.Addicted to Chaos - 5/5 - This is one of my fav drum parts on the cd, its simple, yet it is the foundation of the song.<BR>4.A tout le Monde - 5/5 - Great vocals in this song, which has quicky turned into a Megadeth classic.<BR>5.Elysian Fields - 4/5 - Great song, sweet backup vocals.<BR>6.The Killing road - 5/5 - Love the lyrics in this song, the best guitar solo      on this cd, one of the faster songs.<BR>7.Blood of Hereos - 4/5 -  This a good song, the only thing wrong is it is a little repetetive, but still cool.<br />8.Family Tree - 5/5 - This one of my favs, insest is gross, but  thats what makes it cool. Killer song, sweet solo.<BR>9.Youthanasia - 5/5 - Cool title track, great lyrics.<BR>10.I though I Knew It All - 5/5 - Great song, what more can i say?<BR>11.Black Curtains - 4/5 - This my least fav on the cd. Its still kickass, but it and Elysian Fields are my least favs.<BR>12.Victory - 5/5 - This is a sweet song, so original. This song, Train of Consequences, and Family Tree are my favs off this cd.  <br />Overall, this is a Megadeth essential, get it.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I guess when you have money and connections in Hollywood you can<BR>slap together something as bad as this and call it a movie.
B0001XAPX8|3.0|I wonder about the book upon which the film is based. Somehow I imagine that all the characters and their stories unfold in a more graceful way than they do (or can) with the limitations of a film. Nevertheless, the film does manage to convey both the seeming injustice of what happens to Anthony Hopkins' character as he nears the end of his career and the irony of it happening. It reinforces, in much the same way as the more recent House of Sand and Fog adaptation does, how obsessed people are with preserving a front or facade behind which they have lived for so long that they no longer know how to live otherwise, nor how to acknowledge the truth of their circumstances, even if it would save them. <br />Hopkins is predictably good in the role; Gary Sinise is good but somehow superfluous in his role as the narrator of the story; Nicole Kidman is good but somehow still not believable here because she is just too beautiful, too demure. In some ways, she is excellent and fits well in this role as a woman who has left behind a privileged background and gone down a path riddled with so much loss and misfortune and grief that she has deteriorated into the standoffish and icy woman she seems to be. But does she fit the role of cleaning woman and woman who awakens early to milk cows? Almost, but not quite. She did not disappear into this role. As a completely unhinged, disturbed Vietnam veteran/Kidman's husband, Ed Harris is somehow... alarming. In a good way.<br />The back story about the history of Silk's (Hopkins's) character is a well-handled matter, which ultimately clues the viewer in to the irony and sheer ridiculousness of charges waged against Silk in the present day.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has gotten a lot of undeserved flack from music lovers and critics alike. I believe she deserves more credit from the music industry and I believe this album proves that much. Britney has grown over the past few years and it can be seen in her music. Thankfully Britney has not only evolved personally but also musically. &quot;Breathe On Me, Toxic, Touch Of My Hand, Everytime, and Showdown&quot; all display Britney's depth nicely. Something Britney deserves credit for is being able to produce a better album each and every single time. I'm very proud to be a Britney fan and I can't wait to see what the future holds. She truly is the second coming of Madonna.
B0000DKTU9|5.0|This CD is HOT!!!!!!!!! The great Miss Alicia Keys is only 22 years old and is one of the ONLY artists since the legendary Prince to write, produce, arrange, compose, AND perform all of her songs!!!!<BR>There are mellow jams on this CD as well as some hyped beats like &quot;Karma&quot; and &quot;Heartburn&quot;. If you have yet to purchase this CD/DVD combo, what r u waiting for???!<BR>The DVD is hot as well- behind the scenes with Alicia and her peeps on the road, interviews, etc. Add this to your CD collection for sure! She is destined to be a legend!
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is an excellent movie.  My most favorite character is Dory.  She is hilarious but exasperating.  One of my favorite parts is when Dory is jumping on the jellyfish like a trampoline.  I like the fish way of life in this film.  It is sad in the beginning but it gets much better.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|To paraphrase a line found within this film, this is a movie to love! The writing and the directing are solid. It successfully delves into the realms of comedy and drama both without becoming too much of one and foresaking the other. <BR>Is it intelligently written? Yes. Does &quot;intelligently written&quot; mean that it's &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;? Of course not! But then, would a romantic comedy benefit from an austere take on life like some whine is missing from this film? Probably not. Besides, there are other worthy films that achieve that goal and are available. Sometimes, I think cynicism is confused or equated with&quot;intelligent&quot;. Rather, it's intelligent in the fact that it does not blandly parcel out the storyline like so many movies do these days. It doens't pander and go for the easy laughs and/or sight gags. I intensely dislike movies that seem as if written from a board room of Hollywood executives. Fortunately, this movie is not one of them whereas &quot;Sleepless In Seattle&quot; was (for me).<BR>The acting is fantastic! Keaton and Nicholson could charm an audience by reciting the ingredients off of a soup can! They're chemistry together feels genuine and they hit all the right notes from the smallest inflections to the larger, overall actions within the storyline. All of the other actors are solid in their performances as well and lend credibility and their own sense of charm as well. <BR>The music in this movie is great too and works well to support the tone without being intrusive. <BR>My only criticism (and it's minor) is that it dragged just a tad three quarters through the film but picks up again towards the end. There really are no holes in the story which I was pleased with. <BR>All in all, this is a movie that will give you a lift without sacrificing intelligence or compromising integrity for the sake of doing so. &quot;Somethings Gotta Give&quot; is not only a movie to  love but one to own as well!
B00000JCOV|4.0|In my opinion this is a good album, better then there Iowa one.  There was really only 1 song that i didnt like whcich was scissors, and the intro was a bit weird but not bad.  Slip it out, and wait and bleed are both singles from the album and are very good.  This band is great because of the use out the dess and sampling that most bands do not have, it give a unique sound.  This is not my favorite band, i like linkin park, red hot chili peppers, pearl jam, nirvana, and incubus too so i am not a mega fan of slipknot.  In conclusion 4 stars, mostly good stuff here.
B000002LQR|5.0|this has to be possibly one of the greatest cd's of all time. Listen to it, because it will change your life. Flea drives the band with his raunchy slap bass throughout the entire record. John Fruciante has loud, obnoxious solos, but they seem to fit the style they are going for. While many people only kmnow this record for Give it Away, please do yourself a favor a buy this cd. Every track is amazing and you will never get bored of it.
B000002HEP|1.0|A set singularly lacking in imagination or originality coupled with mediocre production. Even the cover art, by the late Marc Rude, is below his usually high standards.
B00005MP58|5.0|I actually like the dvd better than the vhs because the colors are more vibrant and you don't have to change out the tapes every 45 min. It's a great movie to have on in the background when cleaning the house or folding laundry. I highly recomend it.
B0000399WC|5.0|Quite easily one of the greatest stories ever!! I came about this movie since my dad had a big dusty book on the shelves downstairs called: Papillon. Once opened, I realized the author, Henri had the same last name as I did, and it turns out that I am of the same bloodline as he was. This sparked my interest, but of all due honesty, this is one of the GREATEST STORIES EVER!!!! Easily comparable to the Shawshank Redemption, which is also a great movie. I HIGHLY recommend the movie (and book as well) to anybody and everybody!!!<br />Nicole, tu voulais savoir si une version francaise serait disponible. Je ne crois pas qu'une version francaise a été produite, mais la version anglaise contient des sous-titres franco. Je recommende TRES fortement que tu visionne le filme, car ca vaut la peine de lire chaque phrase!!!! EXCELLENT FILME!!!
0312995423|1.0|Da Vinci Code was fascinating and I was expecting another good read, but was sorely disappointed. I don't totally blame Dan Brown - the publishing company unearthed this obviously older novel to piggy-back on Mr. Brown's current popularity. It was terribly out of date and full of holes.
B0001ADB8C|3.0|2004 *finally* sees--after seemingly endless delays from all sides--the re-release of George Harrison's post-Capitol output on Dark Horse records. To some, the idea that any former-Beatles material could ever be out of print is pure sacriledge; this set (and the individual reissues that accompany it) puts right that wrong.<br />Unfortunately, the six albums contained in this collection--33 and 1/3, George Harrison, Somewhere in England, Gone Troppo, Cloud 9, and Live in Japan--have always represented a maddeningly inconsistent period for Beatle George. While two are generally highly regarded (33 and 1/3 is viewed by some as a lost classic, and Cloud 9 is--quibbles about Mr. Lynne's production aside--one of the most unexpected career renaissances ever), some of the other albums are not looked at as kindly by the scrutiny of hindsight. &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; and &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; aren't bad albums by any stretch of the imagination--the latter is somewhat unfairly maligned--but to use another former-Beatle parallel, they are the &quot;Mind Games&quot; to All Things Must Pass's &quot;Plastic Ono Band.&quot; <br />On the plus side, the &quot;remastering&quot; done here is far, *far* better than the hackjob inflicted on &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot; Granted, the original Warner Brothers discs were pretty good to begin with; however, there are little improvements here and there, and the drive to &quot;modernize&quot; the sound by compressing it to death is thankfully not in attendence.<br />Bah, enough with the critical caution. All of these discs have their champions, and there're certainly gems lurking within; I, for one, am a big fan of 1979's self-titled effort, especially the racing tune &quot;Faster.&quot; The albums are definitely worth hearing.<br />But is this super-expensive boxed-set the answer? To the casual fan, the answer's a resounding &quot;no!&quot; The booklet is nice, I suppose, and the somewhat-rushed DVD does fill a niche (althoughnow that I know what the &quot;Live in Japan&quot; shows *looked* like, I'm even less fond of that somewhat-sterile live artifact), but only seriously hard-core collectors will see these perks as being worth ~$50 more than buying the discs separately at retail. The DVD in particular feels like a &quot;preview&quot; more than a collector's exclusive; where, for example, is &quot;Blow Away,&quot; and why don't we get more of that TV appearence for &quot;This Song?&quot; Worse, the paltry bonus tracks/annotation on the CDs don't really make these &quot;upgrades&quot; significantly more attractive than the original Warner Brothers discs, which have been hitting used bins en masse. We were promised a cornucopia of out-takes and rarities, and if they're being saved for a future boxed-set down the line, making *this* your collector's expenditure seems somewhat silly.<br />Verdict? I'm not saying that the &quot;Dark Horse Years&quot; boxed-set is bad, nor am I saying the albums aren't worth investigation. They are! But this set is an unfortunate reminder of what could have been, and it offers very little value over simply buying the discs separately. And if one merely wants to *hear* the albums, the dumping of &quot;old&quot; editions of the albums makes that very affordable (and heck, it isn't like old LPs were ever difficult to find). This &quot;Dark Horse&quot; set reminds one of those super-expensive &quot;Songs by George Harrison&quot; comps that offered very little value for a lot of money. Let's hope the Harrison estate reverses that trend in the future.
076790592X|5.0|The most impressive thing about Morrie that comes through in this book is his humanity. Morrie doesn't try to make his disease look better or worse than it is, nor is he the victim of it. He brilliantly conveys his sense of what makes a life worth living; it's not making money, or being famous, or working ones self to exhaustion. Morrie focuses on those things we can look back on at the end of our lives and know that our time on this planet was not wasted, &quot;are you giving to your community&quot;, &quot;are you at peace with yourself&quot;. One of the most important of these to Morrie is  relationship, specifically asking &quot;Have you found someone to share your heart with&quot;. Some people would ask that question and you would feel compelled to smack them, but with Morrie, it feels like he is asking to bring us closer to ourselves, as if only by giving to another can we fully be alive.<BR> <BR>On the topic of relationships, I have another book I'd like to recommend to you, &quot;Working on Your Relationship Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. It reveals the Kanes unique approach to having people rediscover their ability to create and maintain over time relationships that are vibrant and alive. The book has both theoretical foundations for relating and intimate vignettes from the Kanes seminars that allow you to see these principles in action.<BR> <BR>I highly recommend both of these books to you.
B000046PVN|5.0|John Williams is the man in Hollywood when it comes to composing movie scores. If you want some evidence to back that statement up then purchase this soundtrack.<br />The theme for Superman:The Movie could possibly be the greatest score ever for a film. It's an absolutely amazing song. The brass work in the song is incredible. The melody in the song is amazing. John Williams is known for his heavy brass parts and the trumpets are incredible in this song. When they hit that climax of that short run in the melody I smile everytime. It's such am amazing song and makes this soundtrack worth the price.<br />The rest of the cd isn't bad, but nothing can compare to the theme. A lot of the songs on the soundtrack contain parts from it. This really is an easy listening peace that you will listen to every song.<br />If you love John Williams then buy this. If you love Superman buy this. If you love classical music then buy this. You won't regret it.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|You've seen the movie you know what happens and if you havent seen this movie I suggest you pick it up and see what everyone is talking about.  I own both editions of this movie.  I have this edition which just recently came out and the previous one released years ago.  This one has a lot of bonus features but I've never been one to get all excited over bonus features.  All I really care about is the movie it self and this is one that no one can afford to miss.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|At a price of $13.49 for fourteen really solid songs, this CD is a good deal.  There also a couple of good songs from the second half of the album.
B00014TJUC|4.0|I find it strange that &quot;Absent Friends&quot; is heralded by various editorial sources as being a &quot;return to form.&quot; More properly, it's a return to a stylistic base (I'm one of those people who believes that Regeneration was a fun variation on a common theme). But oh how good it is! Those who're hankerin' for a return to the chamber-pop indies days of the Divine Comedy will love this release...as should, well, everyone else, ideally.<br />&quot;Charmed Life&quot; sets the tone; from its piano intro, it's immediately evident that the &quot;old&quot; Divine Comedy vibe is back. Refreshingly, Hannon has learned from his &quot;Regeneration&quot; experiment, and manages to meld his older style with that newer approach on some tracks. &quot;Leaving Today&quot; combines &quot;Regeneration&quot;'s moodiness and atmospheric approach with a lush, dramatic string arrangement. &quot;Wreck of the Beautiful&quot; continues in this tradition. Essentially, the tone retains the old Divine Comedy playfullness, but isn't afraid to indulge in introspection.<br />The more characteristically Hannon moments are also delightful. I absolutely adore &quot;Come Home Billy Bird,&quot; which features some of the most entertaining lyrics on the album (I've seen reviews that critique it as being &quot;formulaic.&quot; Ehh. If it's by numbers, it's at least done very, very well). And I have a soft spot for &quot;The Happy Goth,&quot; a song I saw Mr. Hannon play while he was opening for Ben Folds in New York a few years ago (my formative DC experience, natch). <br />Cons? The album seems to drag somewhat near the end, and there is a distinct lack of uptempo numbers (&quot;Billy Bird&quot;) excepted. &quot;Laika's Theme&quot; is pretty, but doesn't really go anywhere.<br />Verdict? A worthy entry in the Divine Comedy canon; to experienced fans it could conceivably either sound like more of the same or a welcome return to normalcy, but I'll stand confident in my statement that I just *really, really like* the thing. It's currently only available as a pricey import (and is, I gather, probably copy-protected in much of Europe), but presumably that'll change in the upcoming weeks. If you've never heard the band before, this is a great place to dive in.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|The DVD Collection is really outstanding and I don't want to spend your time reading the same comments that other users put on Amazon.<BR>The only additional comment is related with the Spanish Audio Track that has a problem: On the extended versions, you can hear spanish UNTIL there is the extended minutes where automatically the DVD sounds in English Subtitled to Spanish.

0375703764|5.0|Just flipping through the pages of House Of Leaves, one can see that it's anything but an ordinary read. Paragraphs written sideways, &quot;missing&quot; bits of text, and pages with one or two words on them, all help to develop the book's incredible sense of foreboding and unease. There are also a ton of footnotes included (many simply for interests sake), and going through them all makes for a considerably labyrinthine reading experience. In fact, there's a whole chapter devoted to labyrinths. Go figure.<BR> While some tote this book as a thriller, I disagree. Granted, there are a few places where there is a feeling of suspense in the air, but most of the book is just really, really interesting reading. There are philosophical quotes, stories of life on the streets, examinations in psychology, and pretty much everything else included within the confines of it's pages.<BR> Perhaps one of the most intriguing things about the book however, is it's deep dissection of it's own components (a novel that studies itself). The Truant and editorial comments, as well as the professional quotes all come together to create something of an examination of the book, within the book (it is written as a documentary after all), which leaves us with both more, and less to think about once we're through. On one hand, this professional dissection of the novel answers many of the questions for us, giving us little to wonder about. Adversely, we can take our own perspective on these examinations and develop a personal view of the events in the book. Despite all the theories, and interviews included, however, there is still a great deal of material left to our imaginations.<BR> Overall, House Of Leaves may just be the best book I've ever read, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to form their own opinions about what they read. I will warn you, however, that the ending is somewhat inconclusive, and there are many unanswered questions. Depending on you're approach to the book, this may ormay not be a good thing.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|Al Pacino plays Carlito Bregante, an ex-con who is very famous for his previous crimes but is trying to lead a straight life.  This is an excellent movie for anyone but a definite must see if you are an Al Pacino fan.  Carlito slowly gets pulled back into the life he lead before because he is trying to help the people he cares about.  I'm not gonna tell the whole story because I dont want to ruin it for those who havent seen it.  But this is a great movie and I recommend it for everyone.
B00004R99J|5.0|I really love this movie.  First of all, nobody should be getting their pants in a bundle just because the movie does not exactly follow what &quot;actually&quot; happened in history.  You have to remember that this movie was ultimately made for children and it does give them enough info to realize what is happening in the story.  The animation is good, and the facial features are wonderful.  But, I would have to say that my favorite thing about that movie is the music.  The rest of the movie is great, but the music is magnificant.  The song &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; is one of the greatest songs.  I also think that there is plenty of humor in the movie( most of it from grandmother willow). I would really recommend this movie to anyone.
6305907145|1.0|I am a Jane Austen fan and was so utterly disappointed with this movie.  It was nothing like the real &quot;mansfield park.&quot;  there were so many distortions of characters and plots to make it shorter.  &quot;mansfield park&quot; is such a good book and for them to have given the wrong perception of the novel by making this movie was an insult.  it would have been better off not made at all. if you've ever read a Jane Austen novel, and watch this movie, you'll probably turn it off because it's so inconsistent with her style and characterizations.  whatever you do, please do not watch this so-called &quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; it's a waste of your time and money.  Go read the book instead, the book is phenomenal. If it were possible, it'd give this movie a -5 stars.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Revolutions is the final chapter of a marvelous myth. Properly understood, we can appreciate that the Matrix Trilogy is the Wachowski brother's version of the story of enlightenment - the story of Self realization; the story of Consciousness transcending the dualistic smaller egoic versions of self that keep \\"us\\" preoccupied and transfixed short of the ONE. The brothers are synthesizers - they are telling their story blending references to all the traditions, but focusing on the common denominators that allow the traditions to be appreciated as a whole - as one truth. That's why the story has such ecumenical appeal. But this mixing of metaphors is also the source of much confusion, resulting in what I have often referred to as Matrix madness. <BR>The confusion of Matrix madness, however, can be resolved by coming to some kind of coherent understanding as to what it is that the movie symbols symbolize. There are so many inter-related symbols that need interpreting; I doubt that anyone could map all of them to the original intent of the Brothers. And as with all metaphoric interpretations, the validity of the mapping is always driven by the personal context that the interpreter brings to the task. But there is one interpretive mapping that in my view is key to all the others, and that is this: the characters in the movie represent aspects of you, the viewer of the show. Humans represent human spirit, and map to the subjective / spiritual / intangible domain within you. Matrix programs represent brain based neural programs, and map to the objective / machinery / mecha domain within you. The movie is about you, the viewer - the witnessing Self. If one follows this line of representation, then it follows that the matrix is your mind; it re-presents the world as you experience it. The (three) cities are ontological worldviews; and the buildings and structures within the cities are aspects of your self and your psyche. Spirit meets mecha in the matrix of your mind. What'smore, we see that the spirit and machine domains are correlated with each other - that one supports the other, that they are reflections of each other. The matrix world is your world; the world encoded in your mind. Meta-mental value laden soul ships hover in an abstract domain beyond the matrix and feed the matrix form `above', whereas evolutionarily derived mecha generated programs from the physical domain feed the matrix from `below'. Everything in our world and in the Matrix world is dualistic; opposites define each other. There is no left without right, no right without wrong, no good without evil, no ascent without descent. What's more, there is no spirit without mecha; no transcendent without an immanent; no Neo without A Smith. <BR>Each of us has a notion as to the referent of the pronoun \\"I\\", but for most of us it's actually very difficult to define that notion using the tools of language. Nevertheless, body, mind and spirit do evolve in each of us as we grow in life. The movie viewer's worldview (sense of self) expands as the story unfolds to progressively encompass more characters, more cities and more complex relationships and tensions within and between them. The story is about how the warring dualities of these elements within you (the viewer) can ultimately be resolved, not by conflict, but by synthesis, allowing the many to become the ONE. <BR>\\"Seeing\\" this version of the Matrix may require some thinking, reflecting, and reading. It's not that easy to \\"see\\" or \\"be\\" the one. For those having difficulty (with Reloaded/ Revolutions) converting what seems like meaningless techno babble and trite dialogue or a rambling tale of kung fu fighting into a coherent story line about enlightenment, an open minded reading of just about any spiritual work with a mystical bent will definitely help. This is true because all such readings are also maps of the very same territory encoded in the Matrix. But to see all that the Matrix has to say, one needs to understandhow the trilogy also embraces the scientific worldview in general and certain aspects of quantum mechanics in particular. The story is pointing towards a resolution of the (apparent) conflict between science and religion, between mecha and spirit, between \\"its\\" and \\"I\\". To see these issues through the Brother's eye/\\"I\\"s, one needs not only some familiarity with the interior of many religious traditions, but also at least a cursory understanding of postmodern philosophy, and a layman's working knowledge of quantum mechanics as it applies to duality, complementarity, causality, and choice. And yes, that may seem like a pretty big problem. But if you understand that the Matrix really does have you and all of us, and if you therefore want to understand what happened to a great story that perhaps seems at times to have lost its way - you may, in fact, wish to consider looking more closely into the whole rabbit hole of consciousness. <BR>Two of the very best Matrix ciphers that I have found (and I believe there are many) include: A Brief History of Everything by Ken Wilber (or really almost anything that KW has written), and The Tao of Physics by Fritjof Capra. In that Wilber is a grand spiritual and philosophical synthesizer (integrator), and in that the brothers have (IMHO) quite the same intent, I believe that once you discover how to overlay Wilber's model/map of human consciousness onto that of the Trilogy, you will find that you can, indeed, decode the Matrix. Capra, in The Tao of Physics, presents an `enlightened' physicist's view of the same integrating principles, speaking to a realm of understanding and awareness that transcends duality in both the physical and spiritual domains. <BR>All that having been said, might I suggest an alternative and simpler path to the appreciation of a beautiful story: review your own religious and philosophic traditions from a mystical perspective, learn a little something about numerology - then find and interpret EVERY number inthe movie. Play with the implied punctuation in the movie dialogue. Pay attention to colors and color balance. And perhaps most importantly, think about the \\"I\\"s (eyes) of each and every character. Then watch the DVDs very carefully, more than twice, and just try hard to see the Matrix for your Self.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never wrote any review for anything before so this is my first time. I honestly felt I should write a review for this show because it deserves a recommendation. I don't watch much TV, and although there are a few shows on that I like I would never buy the DVDs. Heck, I don't even know why I bought these, guess I was just bored and had a few bucks to spend and was looking for some good entertainment. The number of 5 star reviews for this show sealed the deal for me (although I found out later some of these were written by devoted fans to bump up the DVD's sales... I probably would have thought twice about buying if I found out earlier. I am glad I didn't). After watching the entire set I know why the fans are so devoted. The dialog is witty, the characters(and their relationships) are interesting and real, and the storylines are solid. Some maybe turned off by the fushion setting but it makes perfect sense in context. Each episode is fresh and honestly better than most TV shows and movies out there. There's a good balance of action, drama, and comedy. This show will lead you to think the plot was going one way then completely surprise you (in a good way). Even if you knew things weren't going the way it seems you wouldn't know where it would end up. Special effects are good. Watching the cast/crew interviews you can tell they loved working on this show and the results show. This show is not like your standard scifi with the techno babble and boring moral people. The characters are real people in a gritty world. I just wished this show was longer since by the end you can see hints of real interesting things developing on the horizon. Too bad FOX cut the show short, they had a real gem on their hands (what the heck were those guys thinking?). At least there's a movie in the works. Hope another network picks it up if it's a hit. Overall I recommend it to anyone who likes scifi, westerns, or just plain old good TV.
B000001Y16|5.0|Its hard to get on here and rate a 2pac album and say something that hasnt already been said.  Many people think that this is his best album... but I'm not sure which one is his best.  But this is definitely in the top 2 or 3.  This is a short album but it has some very deep and dark lyrics.  You could tell that Tupac was in a dark time in his life.  The album starts off strong with the hard hitting diss to his enemies with BOMB FIRST, next comes HAIL MARY and we all know how great that song is.  TOSS IT UP is more on a party or dance level but still a great song.  Pac shows his love for Cali in 2 LIVE AND DIE IN LA.  BLASPHEMY is probably my favorite song on the album because of the lyrics.  I love listenin to what Pac has to say and you can tell he put a lor of emotion in this song.  LIFE OF AN OUTLAW is another upbeat song from Pac but with deeper lyrics.  JUST LIKE DADDY is another on of those song Pac has made for the ladies.  KRAZY is a great laid back song to listen to but Pac grabs your attention again with more deep lyrics on WHITE MANS WORLD(great song)  ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND is a great song with PAc talking about his girl and his gun. (way better than Jay-Z's version)  HOLD YA HEAD is another song where Pac tries to lift you up with positive lyrics. In AGAINST ALL ODDS Pac targets his enemies again with another great track.  <br />The best thing about this album is that every song is good and it gives you such a variety of Pac's style.  5 STARS for the GREATEST OF ALL TIME
B00014NE62|5.0|This is the story of the love that dared not speak its name during the time it couldn't speak.  Maurice is the title character of an E.M. Forster novel that Forster himself opted not to have published until after his death, due to the content.<br />James Wilby and a then-unknown Hugh Grant star in this fabulous Merchant-Ivory production, that carries with it all the hallmark opulence that Merchant-Ivory are known for in other films such as 'A Room with a View' and 'A Passage to India' -- the music is impressive if understated, the characters superbly played by the actors (look for Simon Callow, himself a gay actor, as one of the innocent Victorian onlookers, and Ben Kingsley as a rather interesting character, one of the early psychologists to attempt to engage in what is today called reparative therapy).<br />Maurice (Wilby) is trying to come to terms with being gay in his college days in late Victorian England.  Clive Durham, a young man of property (Grant) has done the \\"gay\\" thing in college, but decides at some point that his station in society is more important, so he does his best to repress his true feelings, which leads to regret.  Is this the same regret Forster had during his lifetime?  My favorite line from the whole film has to be the psychologist Kingsley, who says the English have always been \\"disinclined\\" to accept human nature.<br />The film does have a moral, but not one that hits you over the head.  In the end, this is a love story, although not the kind you might expect, and we are left with an ambiguous ending, just like Forster's novel.<br />The DVD has many extras, including deleted scenes, a reconstructed beginning, interviews with actors and production figures, and is re-done for the DVD with a stunning transfer.<br />This is one of the best films ever made.
0805066691|5.0|This book first of all has fantastic details and has the closest depictions of the Indian Wars during this time period. I've read some of the other reviews and was disappointed to see certain comments made about how one-sided or biased this book was. It was from the Native American's point of views but much of it was all too true. Sure it wasn't right that the Indians attacked settlements but then again, was it right for white settlers to come in and take over land that was already inhabited to begin with? They believed in Manifest Destiny and that they had the right to supposed \\"free land\\" and that because primitives just lived on it and because they didn't farm it, they really had no rights to it. A good \\"modern example\\" would be this, how would you like it if the government was to move you from your home in which you had settled in and you liked the area, but then they kept moving you from house to house until you were put in an area that had nothing. Especially, in a centralized location where your food supply was taken away and instead the government had purposely given you a rotten supply of food. Tepees back then were like the RV's of today. They were not permanent homes for the Indians, but they started using them because they were always getting pushed further out to the West out of their villages all over the U.S. When flight was no longer an option, sadly, the only thing left for the Natives was fight... I realize this book in some ways seem controversial but I'll put it as my college History teacher had mentioned, this book is the closest thing to the real deal.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|.<BR>One of the most interesting aspects of LIT is the market's reaction to it:  most of those who caught it in a theater loved it, and a great many who've seen it first on DVD are angry with it.<br />Why?<br />1) Well, the grouches are quite right--it's not much of a comedy, there's very little story, and the characters aren't going through giant transformations across the course of the film.  If you're sitting at home with your significant other or a bunch of friends, if you're talking, if the sound of crunching snacks in your head is louder than the soundtrack, if the lights are on or the phone rings, forget it, you're done--it's like visiting a zen rock garden with a GameBoy, and your only shot at liking this film is personally relating to what the characters have experienced, or if you've been to Tokyo.<br />2) The rabid fans are quite right too--LIT is an \\"experience\\" film that is mismarketed as a Bill Murray comedy; it's all about sights and sounds, not story.  It lets you know this from the very first shot, a long, wordless look at, um, Scarlett Johansson, with a quietly rising and subsiding sound clip from Kevin Shields, the songwriter of the greatest lost band of last twenty years, My Bloody Valentine (if you don't know, YOU BETTER ASK SOMEBODY).  There's every chance this bombs at home, but in a theater, in the dark, with great sound and everybody shutting up, it works.<br />That first shot sets the tone for LIT.  There's not a single jump cut or sudden burst of sound in the entire film--it's supposed to be a slow, alluring, engulfing experience; again, this is terrific in a theater, but it's a fragile spell, and it's easy to see why it might not work at home.<br />3) The grouches are also right when they criticize the dialogue.  In literal terms, not a lot is being said.  If you don't attach to the characters at all, it isn't hard to start hating a young, pretty, apathetic whiner and a rich middle-aged whiner, both given the luxury of fretting full-timeover existential problems, which, if you don't like the leads, seem pretty trivial.  It's not hard to see why that doesn't make for a fun movie night.<br />4) The rabid fans can argue this one--LIT is very much about what's NOT said.  <br />Think about the most verbal characters in the film: they're babbling.  The sweetly inattentive husband is wildly inarticulate--he's perpetually distracted, and constantly interrupting his own train of thought.  The starlet (a snarky sendup of Cameron Diaz) grows more vapid by the sentence.  Bill Murray's wife is nothing but a telephone voice, transfixed by carpet swatches and bored by everything else.  And from the dead-serious commercial director to the ebulliently idiotic talk show host, there's no clear translation of the spoken Japanese.  For God's sake, when she over-emotes her way through Scarborough Fair, the lounge singer is a self-parody, unintentionally echoing Bill Murray's famous SNL parody of a lounge singer pouring out Scarborough Fair.  Every one of them is lost in translation.<br />In a different way, so are Bob and Charlotte.  The reason LIT doesn't have a story is that the entire film is an interlude--two people who suddenly find themselves together, sharing a break from their lives.  <br />And they both seem to really need it--they're sick of the meaningless conversations and logistics that drive their worlds.  It's a classic use of the medium, to show the huge gap between what's said and what's seen.  Bob and Charlotte are wonderfully quiet and accepting of each other from the get go--they don't have talk much to connect.  If you watch for it, there's a silent shift in the film:  before she meets Bob, Charlotte is rattled by how numb she feels when she visits a temple and retreats to her hotel room, surrounding herself with junk media.  Before Bob meets Charlotte, he sleepwalks through his workday, producing junk media.  After they meet, when they spend time on their own, they wander wordlessly and beautifullyalone:  Bob golfs by himself with Mt. Fuji in the distance, and Mt. Fuji floats by Charlotte on a Kyoto bullet train, as she heads off to visit another temple.  They're discovering a less bewildering, more personal Japan, and retrieving themselves as they do it.  And all this is shown, not spoken.<br />5) The grouches have a point: nothing freaking happens in LIT.<br />6) The fans answer:  yeah, exactly.  The key to the film is what doesn't happen between the characters.  It's no accident that LIT takes place in bustling, frenetic Tokyo, or that the main characters are hopelessly jetlagged and out of sync with everything except each other.  If that doesn't sink in early, then you'll miss the many charms of LIT, from the long, lovely shots, the sweet, spare exchanges between Bob and Charlotte, the gorgeously slow shoegazer/trip-hop/dream pop soundtrack (the best since Trainspotting, High Art,and Ms. Coppola's last film, the Virgin Suicides), and the electrifyingly silent ending.<br />So, sorry if you hated this film.  Have a drink, maybe two, turn the off lights, don't talk, watch it again, and you might change your mind.<br />(Oh, and if you take into account EVERY image of Japanese people in this film--the businesspmen and women, the artists, the florists, the crowds in the street, the surfers, the strippers, the monks, the bride and groom, the elderly patient, the doctor, etc.--it's harder to argue that LIT is an anti-Japanese film, and easier to see it for what it is:  an outsider's POV of a few silly and sublime experiences in an unfamiliar culture).
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather Part 1 - Arguably the greatest film of all time, this movie is undeniably a masterpeice. <BR>The Godfather Part 2 - By far the best sequel of all time, this is a cinematic experience must be viewed by all who think they know movies.<BR>The Godfather Part 3 - Considered by many to be a cash in, this is still an incredible movie in its own right. Say what you want about part 3, it is still a passable ending to the best film series of all time.<br />Extras - Each disc comes with a comentary track by coppola, and some others. Best comentary ever, in my opinion. 5th disc contains hours of extras, several making of features, trailers, a interesting family tree, photo galleries, and much much more.<br />Recomendation - although somewat pricey this set is a must own. Buy today!
B0001I55OC|5.0|Although it is not as good as the book, the movie is full of action and interesting enough to keep your attention. The actors do a very good job and what I especially liked was the costumes -- they were period-accurate but not in-your-face costumes like most Elizabethan era costumes. Some ideas may seem like we have seen them a lot (with all the other time-travel movies), but this was still unique in some ways (the book was even better). Good movie worth watching.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I am so tired of seeing the horrible reviews this movie recieved.  I am 20, so no, I didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's watching this show.  However, I DID grow up in the 80's and 90's watching this show, so maybe I just have a different take.  Okay, so Freddy Prinze, Jr. was not the most perfect choice for Fred.  A lot of reviews resent his representation as an attention starved and fame hogging character, but I have to say that while the movie took it to the extreme, it by no means pulled it out of thin air.  And Daphne was always getting captured and lost in the spooky old dungeons and mansions, and it was normally Velma or (Duh duh duh!) good ol' Freddy to the rescue.  And the romantic connection everyone is claiming came from nowhere at the end of the movie?  Were ya'll even watching?!?  While Gellar and Prinze may only have been chosen for their star power and not for their excellent casting as the characters, they DO portray the relationship that we all know existed between Daphne and Fred rather well.  And NO ONE can tell me Velma and Shaggy weren't brilliantly casted!  <BR>The plot, while not in the &quot;Scooby Doo, Where are you?&quot; fashion, is more along the lines of &quot;The Thirteen Ghosts of Scooby Doo&quot; minus Vincent Price.  The monsters are real, not masked men. And for all the Christians bashing the movie for that reason, be forewarned, if you deny the existence of evil in the world, regardless of your religion, then you open yourself to it.  Being unaware doesn't exclude.  Besides, this was a FUN, FAMILY ORIENTED movie, remember.  The occult elements were in Scooby Doo fashion, discovering new legends associated with the area in which they are investigating the mystery.<BR>In essence, if you enjoy this movie for what it was intended to be, which was a fresh representation of fantastic characters, which remains true to the ideas implied in the series, as well as a fun film, then you'll get the point.  If not, then &quot;Zoinks&quot; you take things way too seriously.
B0000039QA|4.0|I know many people will argue that Biggie was and still is the greatest emcee ever to touch the mike, and that Life After Death is pure evidence of this.  I'm not one of those people.  I believe that BIG was a great artist and his absence from the game left a void that has yet to be filled, I don't believe he was the greatest, nor was this album the greatest.  This is a two disk album with only about 8 or 9 tracks that I would even consider good, and last I checked, good isn't = to greatness.  When BIG was on point, he was on point, and songs like &quot;I got a story to tell&quot; truly showed his skills as an artist, but Mo Money, more problems, and few other tracks on the album kinda had me like, that was okay, but not great.  The only thing that made this album memoriable for me when I first purchased it back in 1997, was the fact that Big had passed away.  I feel if he never died, I as well as many others wouldn't have gave this album as much attention as it recieved.  Overall a good album, but not the greatest.  Maybe if it was a one disk instead of double and without all the fluff, yeah I could probably see myself calling this &quot;One of the Greatest Albums&quot;, but I can't.
B000025802|5.0|I recently, actually just before purchasing this set, received Vaclav Neumann's set with the Czech Philharmonic.  A really good set to compare this one to.  I also have had, over the years, different performances of the late symphonies with, Ormandy, Szell, Sawallisch, Walter and Carlo Maria Giulini.  When it comes to lush sound and playing, nothing tops the Philadelphia Orchestra.  It was the first time that I had a chance to listen, side by side, the 7th, 8th and 9th.  But, I must say overall this set is truly magnificent.  In fact Maestro Kubelik's reading of the 2nd symph. helped me to understand the work.  Neumann, although wonderfully played by the Czech orchestra, somehow couldn't bring across the meaning of the work to me, along with the strings sounding like they were in another building somewhere.<br />To me, all of Dvorak's sympyhonies are a set of tone poems that are molded together through a cyclic theme that pops up here and there.  They are all so beautiful and magical and powerful, yet seem to weave together into a beautiful whole that can be called a symphony. <br />My favorites used to be the 1st, 4th, 7th,8th and 9th.  Now, because of the maestro's reading, the second and a deeper love of the fourth.  Infact, I want to add that the second may be the composers best work. Very creative and spontaneous but beautiful and powerful at the same time.  The slow movent of the fourth maybe one of the most beautiful slow movements of any symphony ever composed.<br />His readings of the 3rd, 5th, and 6th are superior also.  In a critique I wrote for the Neumann set I said that the strings were so poorly miked that it took away from his readings and the Kubelik readings magnify this tremendously.<br />The Berlin Philharmonic is wonderful in this set.  I wish DG would have recorded the other works with it.  The recordings with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra are very good, but the viruosity of the BPO would have added even more to the performances.<br />This set is an absolute must have for any basic library of classical music, and a must have for any Dvorack lover, the most underated and underplayed composer of them all. I wonder how few know that Dvorak truly amazed Brahms and Brahms even published some of the symphonies for him.
B00005JMEW|4.0|The film itself is incredible, no other word to discribe it. Most that do not like the movie dont realize it for what it is, a tribute to the great movies that dominated the 70's. the reason this movie did not recieve a 5-star rating is simply because of the lack of extras. A 20 min. making of, some music videos, and trailers from Tarantino's other movies. How hard is it to add some deleted scenes? or record a commentary track (Tarantino has yet to do one for one of his 4 movies). <br />Recomendation: Buy it.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|This recording works fine for what it is, just a fun tribute that is not meant to equal or surpass the original recordings. It's a great band covering some of their favorite Robert Johnson songs sometimes sticking close to the original arrangements and sometimes not. It's not all about Clapton and that will leave some fans disappointed but it does feature tight, controlled ensemble playing that's reminiscent of the early Muddy Waters bands of the fifties. Another reviewer cited Jimmy Rogers classic album Chicago Bound as an example and Muddy Waters Sings Big Bill Broonzy also comes to mind. One also needs to keep in mind that this is an album of covers and as such it's unrealistic to expect it to sound as deep or as haunted as the original work. Ask yourself whether anyone has done a version of Layla that's as tormented as the original and then buy this CD for what it is, just a solid blues album that was meant to pay tribute to Mr. Johnson not compete with him.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I first heard of The White Stripes when I saw that they were nominated for some Grammys.  After watching the Grammys this year, I sort of caught on to their performance of &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;.  It has a good beat and is fun to listen to.<br />So I decided to buy their album.  I was a little hesitant, because I normally do not listen to this kind of music (Indie Rock, etc.).  BUT I have to say that I'm glad I bought the CD.  The music is exciting and full of energy.  They are a great classic rock band.  I mean, their style is classic.  They sound like they are from the 60's.  I really enjoy the CD.  If you liked &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;,  you will like the CD.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Kill Bill is the typical american film. With lots of super special effects with lots of violence and with bad actors. But this is the kind of films that americans likes. I am upset because we are going to have 100 kill bill films. Thats the same that happend with good films like matrix 1 or terminator 1. There were good films. But they made another 2 films on the american way. They won millons of dolars but they ruined what it was a good story.Continue watching jack ass ,beavis and buthead. The mirrors of the american society<br />schwarzenegger for president!!
0767830555|4.0|If there is one film that defines &quot;timeless classic&quot; my pic would be Scorsese's Taxi Driver. DeNiro not only gavethe best performace of the year (1976), arguably the best performance in all of cinema. This film introduced Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas, Casino) and one of the best actors the world will ever see, Robert DeNiro. The only reason this DVD does not achive the 5-star rating is because of the extras. Very good in their own right, but this movie deserved better.

B0001LJCPC|5.0|First, to the reviewer who liked the track in Volume 1 that is heard when Uma cuts off Sophie's arm.  That is 'Death Rides A Horse' by Ennio Morricone and is available on his 'Legendary Italian Westerns' CD.<br />My question.  Does anybody know the track in Volume 2 when that is playing after Uma escaped the coffin and is walking through the desert to Budd's place?<br />The actual Cd is good and should not disappoint fans of Tarantino's soundtracks.  Sure there are soime tracks missing but it is still a good buy if you loved the movie.
B000005DQR|5.0|In 1998 I had a crush on a girl named Ellie.  On a rainy day we decided on an awkward quasi-date to Rasputin's Records and Blondie's Pizza.  I sat down in the passenger seat of her beat-up Accord, she started the engine, and her tape player introduced me to a twinkling piano and hypnotizingly slow breakbeats. The notes fell like raindrops on her windshield, and forever in my mind, that moment, Ellie's perfume, my nervous tension, and DJ Shadow's &quot;Building Steam With A Grain of Salt&quot; were locked inseparably together.  Whenever the rain starts to fall -- not a hard rain and not a sprinkle, but a steady, plodding, relentless patter of water on earth -- I think of this song.<br />Josh Davis, also known as DJ Shadow, makes that kind of impact with the arcane record samples he artfully merges into cohesive, thoughtful, revelatory aural collages.  He is obsessed.  He digs up sounds you and I have never heard before, and maybe a thing or two we have heard before, and fuses them into some brilliant new heterogeneous dream with the power to stir the subconscious and induce sheer awe.<br />Once I bought his CD and broke free of the hold that &quot;Building...&quot; had on me, I got accustomed to the other twelve tracks of the album.  There were many pleasant surprises.  I found &quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot; just as addicting as the song that got me hooked in the first place, a loping, seductive, scratch-heavy, impossibly beautiful five minutes and two seconds.  &quot;Changeling&quot; was another fast favorite, like a lush sunset after a long summer day.  &quot;Stem/Long Stem&quot; creeped me out with pernicious string samples surrounding a single lonely chime.  And although it took some time, &quot;Mutual Slump&quot; eventually won me over with its dual personality: crashing percussion and ugly guitar riffs on the one hand, and a mournful, echoing backdrop offset by a shy girl's spoken diary on the other.<br />Many have already mentioned what an impact this album had on a number of prominent artists such as Moby and Radiohead.  DJ shadow's influence has reverberated for several years now in the music industry.  But for me, I can only attest to what it did for me when seated next to an unreachable girl, in the midst of my quixotic quest, on a gray and rainwashed early spring afternoon.<br />It was nothing short of an epiphany.album had on a number of prominent artists such as Moby and Radiohead.

B00013PHGS|3.0|I would dare to disagree with the most reviewers here.<BR>Yes, this album shows very high quality production.<BR>But I guess I had been spoiled by Air's &quot;Premiere symptoms&quot; and &quot;10,000 Hz&quot;, which were full of spunk, energy, and freshness, which are so rare nowadays.<BR>I found &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; rather boring, actually. It sounds just like other so popular today &quot;chill out&quot;, elevator music.<BR>Expect to hear it repeatedly in upcoming months in your local Crate&amp;Barrel, A&amp;F, Guess, and Nordstrom stores.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|This was not the \\"Greatest Wrestlemania of All Time\\". It barely breaks the top ten of Wrestlemania's.  There have been so many better shows, Wrestlemania and other PPV's, throughout the years. <BR> <BR>Cena versus Big Show was a decent match, nothing special. 5/10<br />Y2J versus Christian.  Jericho is my favorite wrestler around right now and I really like the CLB too.  These guys were not given enough time.  Good match but too short and with a bad ending.  Hopefully Trish won't be so frickin' annoying now that she is a heel again.  6/10<br />The Triple Threat for the title was a good match but far from the \\"Greatest Wrestlemania Main Event of All Time\\".  Look into Rock vs. Austin at WM 17.  Shawn vs. Bret in an Ironman Match at WM 12.  Both of those matches were far superior.  8/10<br />The women's match was a waste of potential.  Both ladies are very proven but were not given a good opportunity.  Crowd also sucked during this one.  4/10<br />What wastes of time were both of the tag matches and that God-forsaken Playboy Evening Gown debacle.  They all three get to share the same space in my review. 0/10 0/10 1/10(for lingire only) <br />The Cruiserwieght Battle Royal was a nice waste of time too.  Theses guys are all very talented but the match was horrible.  Short, but pointless.  Reminded me a lot of the Gimmick Battle Royal at WM 17.  At least that one was supposed to be funny (Ultimo Dragon slipping during his intro...TWICE!). 3/10<br />Brock versus Goldberg?  Somebody shoot me.  Good riddance to that pouty, no talented and uncoordinated Goldberg.  WWE is a better place without him.  Brock had great potential and talent but never fully utilized it.  See ya later Lesnar.  Oh, the match?  Worse that than passing a kidney stone the size of a golfball.  Thank your makers that Stone Cold was out there because the fans may have rioted were it to be otherwise.   1/10 (for the saving presence of good ol' Steve)<br />Rock and Sock against Evolution.  What a waste of the Rock's one comeback match of the year.  This was nothing more than a decent Raw main event.  6/10<br />Undertaker and Kane.  Good match.  Very short and didn't really deliver the promise of \\"The Deadman\\" returning.  Undertaker was more like \\"The American Deadman\\".  Paul Bearer's return was the highlight of this one.  Oh, and Kane's entrance rocked too.  6/10<br />Kurt versus Eddie.  Decent match considering that Kurt should not have been wrestling for the second consecutive Wrestlemania.  The match should have had a better ending.  Kurt Angle is possibly the greatest athlete and wrestler to ever step into a WWE ring.  He also has some of the greatest mic skills next to Stone Cold, The Rock and Jericho.  8/10<br />If I have forgotten anything than that is because the PPV was very forgettable.<br />I saw Backlash yesterday an must say that it was a far better PPV than Wretlemania was.  Much like 1999 when Backlash was the PPV that Wretlemania should have been, the same can be said for this year.  Just because the WWE and the announcers tell you that Wrestlemania was the greatest thing since Donald Trump's hair does not make it true.<br />I am a huge WWE fan and have been for nearly 20 years.  I still love the company but this was just a bad show.  The end.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Tarantino's gift for &quot;easy&quot; moviemaking is unsurpassed.  He doesn't burden the viewer with extraneous matter and the result is a free flowing, singsong of a movie.  There are indeed some parts of Kill Bill 1 that will cause moments of discomfort to the more sensitive viewer, but those shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the story.  Taranatino's fusing of anime and live action, while not strictly new or even experimentation, works and that's what matters, taking viewers to places not usually visited.  Good movie and highly recommended.
B00000I07P|5.0|This album could be a classic I am not going to lie to you I like the 1980s rock music plus this album has songs like Livin on a Prayer and you give love a bad name.This is a great album this is pretty enjoyable folks sold million.<BR>Lyrics 10/10 Production 8/10 Music 10/10 Style 10/10 Voice 10/10<BR>Overall=48/50 This album gets 96% This is 5 stars.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The perfect tribute for the perfect artist with perfect love, that's what this is.  As the cynic I can sometimes be, I am emotionally touched by this tribute.  Very personally do I feel my admiration and love for George.  Anything less than this tribute would have been insulting, anything more would have been too.  It's genuine love displayed by people who loved and cherished a rare type of person in this world, who is even rarer among musicians.  He walked his talk.  He is George Harrison, a man who has influenced millions, if not billions of people.  Buy this DVD set and you will be moved very deeply by the gratitude and affection shown by his friends.  Brilliant, if I could give it more stars your monitor would be filled with them.
B00000K0T8|4.0|Everyone knows that 96 was a different place than it is now. Ghostface Killah finally dropped his long awaited solo debut, Ironman. Today, some fans are still debating as to whether this album is a classic or not. I'll answer that question, but with this release, completely fresh after the release of the CLASSIC Raekwon debut album(Cuban Linx) and the CLASSIC GZA Liquid Swords album, Ghostface was out to prove that he could represent on the solo tip. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: This is a tough one, but THE stand out songs on this album are Iron Maiden, The Faster Blade, 260, Assassination Day, Winter Warz(the first and ONLY song where Cappadonna steals the show), Box In Hand, Daytona 500, All That I Got Is You, and Black Jesus. Other than those highlights, everything else IS worth your time as well.<br />Production: Thumbs up, another awesome RZA production, sans one track.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.<br />Originality: Thumbs up.<br />The Last Word: Overall, this album IS a classic, as Wu-Tang were still in their primes and they maintained their dominance in the hip hop world. Ghostface only got better as the years went on, releasing more polished albums(not taking anything away from this release). To the WU fan(or the hip hop fan), I recommend this album. You will not be disappointed.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed is way beyond Pearl Jam. Only followers make this claim. I like Creed alot, yet I hate with a passion, Pearl Jam. I think they suck. If Creed was PJ then I would like PJ, seeing as I like Creed. Mark Tremont writes much deeper and darker music then PJ. Homan Clay is there second best album. Well Done and definitly is not like Eddie I like to wine Vedder.
B0000028M7|1.0|This group of people suck and any reject thats listening to this stuff is bad I want that dog Zack aka the 15 year old to shut up give the Beatles what you wan't but don't diss rap it is just as good as the Beatles.The Beatles will and will forever be over rated even thought they are good and the paper came out last week and said Mc Cartney is the best Beatle<br />I HEARD SOME of this reject crap and said this truly sucks.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|This movie is really a great but also very bleak representation of what life as a colonial era sailor must have been like. Most movies portray pirates as having fun and partying but M&C shows a much more realistic perspective where the sailors faced dangerous seas and attacks from French and barbarian ships in the Atlantic. <br /> Captain Jack Aubrey is the captain of his ship along with his sidekick surgeon (played by Paul Bettany) and is sailing in the South Atlantic to track down an enemy warship sent out during the Napeleonistic wars in France. A lot of very bleak and sometimes depressing parts are where some of the children are also on board the ship, at the mercy of the seas and weather, plus possible attack by French naval forces. <br /> The movie is really good but sometimes drags on in some places. Some of the scenes are also dull and even depressing but that's what M&C is about: The realistic portrait of the dangers and isolation of 1800s navy duty, plus bravery, loyalty, and faith. It's not \\"PIrates of the Carribean\\" where it's all like slapstick battles. <br /> \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World\\" is an excellent movie and I look forwards to getting this on DVD!! You should too!!
B00005JLXE|1.0|If you thought Hulk and Spiderman were bad movies, then you ain't seen this one. To say it clear and soon: This is the worst super-hero movie ever made. Even Lou Ferrigno's Hulk tv series is better.<br />And it's not a small feat. The movie is based (or so it seems) on probably the best comic ever published by Marvel, Daredevil as written and drawn by young Frank Miller and Klaus Janson in the early 80s. But the only thing they kept is the character's names (Daredevil, Elektra, Kingpin, Bullseye, etc). Their aspect, personalities, relationships, and the whole plot itself bears no similarity with its source (so I doubt it was ever the source), and the changes are only for the worse. The movie is just too bad to waste time going into depths about how they transformed a great, dark, violent, ambiguous comic into a floppy, puerile, idiot film. It's just the modern hollywood formula: make everything as simplistic, senseless, edgeless, and infantile as possible. And with this flick they reached bottomless depths of derision. Really, it's THAT bad. It's hard to believe that the same industry (well, but not the same studio) spawned the excellent X-Men movies.<br />I rated it one star because it was the lowest available. But five stars below zero is more like it.
0062502182|1.0|Reading this book was akin to being trapped in a stale fortune cookie for several days.  The message in this book is worthy of a bad Hallmark card not a novella.  There is no sense of place, no characterization, and no real spiritual depth.  Readers shouldn't waste their time with this tripe.  Read the real stuff instead: Hesse.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is a review written by an ordinary, non-cinema buff whose only other encounter with a Tarantino film was Pulp Fiction. I rented this movie (which I have now ordered for my own) simply out of curiosity, and nothing more.<br />What can I say. I was blown away. From the mixture of genres (spaghetti western to anime to old-time badly dubbed black and white Asian flicks) to the incredible camera work to the kick-you-know-what acting (and fighting) to the mix of color and black and white to the incredible but somehow-it-works plot, this is simply an experience not to miss.<br />Yes, it is incredibly violent. It is also incredibly fun, incredibly beautiful, incredibly exciting, incredibly everything. I loved the Japanese girl group (especially the two extra songs in the additional scenes); I loved the beautiful choreography of the final fight in the snow; I loved Uma Thurman half to death; I loved Lucy Liu; I loved the wickedly evil cameo by Darryl Hanna; sheer spectacle of the entire thing.<br />And while I normally eschew the directors' comments as incredibly boring, NOTHING about Tarantino's comments are boring. He explains the movie with such enthusiasm, such complete lack of self-consciousness, either professional or personal, that you feel he is having a drink with you in your livingroom. Fascinating, endearing, wonderful.<br />Simply a must-watch, must-own DVD, in my own humble opinion.
B000002MM8|2.0|This is one of two DCD albums that I've heard. If it is any indication of the rest of their corpus then I'm staying far, far away.<br />Each to their own- I find the instrumentation over-bearing and fake-sounding- slick and studio-ish. This evokes about as much earthy mood as the soundtrack to your average super-nintendo RPG. The lyrics are usually trite, often idiotic and at times just plain maudlin, &quot;And the past is now your future/It bears witness to your soul/ Make sure the love you offer up/ Does not fall on barren soil...&quot; Never mind how badly the lame-montone singer guy warps his syntax (rhyming soul with soil?) in order to force the rhyme- wasn't that a jack handy musing on SNL a couple years back?<br />Their attempts at evoking the sensual/erotic textures of some Would-be mid-eastern twilight olive grove fall flat, mostly due to the cumbersome electronica tweaks and beats. A few tracks are kinda palatable (when the girl is singing in some other language, thereby masking the lyrical idiocies) but not worth buying or subjecting yourself to repeatedly.<br />I guess this just ain't for me. If it makes your average ageing goth-mom dim the lights and dance about, nostalgic for the early nineties colllege spoken word scene where she lived so brazenly... all the more reason to let these cds find new homes in landfills and sale bins across america the great.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I didn't like OK Computer the first time I heard it. A few more listenings, and I was in love with it; a few more, and I considered it the best CD I'd ever heard. However, very little of the appeal of this music comes from anything that could ever be deemed &quot;pretentious&quot;--I love it because it sounds good. Sure, it's interesting from an intellectual and musical perspective, and it's great that OK Computer has all of that depth, but it's the sound that makes it a great album. It's supremely &quot;listenable&quot; and manages to make even 12-hour plane rides bearable--and that's pretty high praise.
0679428895|4.0|Harris' Pompeii does a very good job of combining history with fiction.  Through the research I have done, I have found the novel to be very historically accurate.  This is a plus for the book considering the fictional plot is very simple and doesn't have a lot of development to it.  The characters also are one-dimensional for the most part, all though there is some change in attitudes in Ampliatus, Corelia, and Attilus.  This doesn't bring down the book though, because the way Harris uses historical data to make the novel interesting is superb.  I found it to be a book I couldn't put down, as I always wanted to see what would happen on the next page.  I was a little disappointed with the ending of the book.  I felt like Harris did a good job of building up to the climax, but then the book just seemed to drop off.  Almost as if the last chapter was missing.  This is the only complaint I have of the novel.  Overall packed with high energy and lots of excitement.  A good and easy pleasure read.  Recommend to all.
B000001FZK|5.0|When I bought this album in 1992 I wasn't ready.  I was a huge fan of Talk Talk, right up until the album that came before (Spirit of Eden, which is brilliant by the way...).  I loved the departure from pop for them.  In fact, it was the quiet, dark, atonal moments in the previous albums that, for me, made Talk Talk stand out.  But Laughing Stock was thick where I wanted thin, liquid where I wanted solid.  I sold it a year later feeling sure it was brilliant and that I was missing out on something wonderful, but unable to appreciate it.<br />Laughing Stock was an album you couldn't be prepared for because there was nothing like it.  Even it's predecessor Spirit of Eden couldn't prepare the listener for the murky, uneasy, passionate journey that Laughing Stock is.  Other reviewers have said it was ahead of it's time.  If that was true in 1992, it's even more true now.  Mainstream music is, with the exception of the last 3 Radiohead albums, still ignorant of this album.  Laughing Stock is like pure grief in that the only way to make sense of it is to let go, let it wash over you and not try to make sense of it at all.  It is painfully brilliant, hugely musical and very peace-inducing if you can surrender to it.  It's not an album to dance to, or to try to decipher in one evening and I don't think there's one hook on the whole thing.  It's the kind of album you put on over and over again until suddenly you notice that everything else starts to sound kind of hollow and trite in comparison. <br />I once read an article with the engineer who explained that every instrument was recorded from a distance (most instruments in pop music are recorded with the microphones only inches away) and almost always in mono.  The drums, for example, were recorded with one microphone from about 10 feet away instead of the traditional rock setup with a mic about 2 inches away from every drum, mixed in stereo and compressed to be full, loud and immediate.  Nothing in Laughing Stock is immediate, especially the vocals, which (again, breaking tradition with 99.999% of all pop recordings) have no special priority over any other instrument and, as a result, are often buried in the mix. Silence and space play an important roll in this album as does the complex and often adversarial relationship between harmony and disonance.  <br />Years later, after hearing 'Tago Mago' by Can, 'Kind of Blue' and 'Bitches Brew' by Miles Davis, I stumbled upon an old tape copy I'd made of 'Laughing Stock' and was overwhelmed by it's brilliance.  What had before seemed aloof and impenetrable felt intimate and almost painfully, passionately naked. I ran to my nearest record store (back when we had record stores) and bought my second copy feeling a lot like a man who has realized his error only a moment before it was too late.  I put the CD in my CD player and played it constantly for about a year.  <br />By the time 'Kid A' came out by Radiohead I felt unsurprised. 'Kid A' was great.  I'm a big fan. But for me, it wasn't revolutionary, it wasn't groundbreaking.  I had already been to the source.  <br /> Laughing Stock is deep stuff, and there there is no other album quite like it.  If you like modern Radiohead, if you like Tom Waits, if you love Can, Holger Czukay, or David Sylvian, you will probably love this album. But you won't love it right away.  Give it time.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Against my better judgment I rented Kill Bill 1 last night - what a mistake! Talk about gratuitous violence! and his style is so pretentious that it makes me cringe...he's so cool man, cause he's, like you know, an auteur - and even Sonny Chiba and David Carradine are in it!<br />The thin as air plot is so lame that Chop Socki Tarentino has to resort to subtitles, cartoons, and voice-over's to help move it along. This isn't just a bad movie, it's a bad movie that is so conceited that it made me feel like a chump for watching it.
B000060P79|5.0|this cd rocks. all the tracks are cool. the one problem is that lots of simple plan's song's tunes are the same. i love it so much that I'm even listening to it now... 10/10
1592400876|5.0|Lynne Truss so eloquently expresses the frustration that many of us feel when we see inept and haphazard use of punctuation, especially when this incorrect punctuation is published or found on permanent signage.  Her accounts of her encounters with mis-punctuated text are entertaining and often hilarious.      Those of us who are fellow \\"sticklers\\" often feel despair or even anger when we come across text that is not punctuated correctly.  However, there is room for us to laugh at our own obsession and take a step back to note the comedy in the common errors in the language.  Truss presents this humorous perspective while still setting a serious, take-no-prisoners tone on the need for everyone to strive towards correct punctuation usage. She not only explains the history of punctuation marks but also clarifies why knowing the history of the marks is beneficial to understanding their usage and evolution.    Trust deserves extra commendation for focusing her book on discussions of punctuation and not straying into the topics of misspellings and incorrect grammar, as tempting as that must have been.      This book will be most appreciated by those of who pay close attention to detail, not only in our own writing, but also in the writings of others.  While Truss clearly explains the rules for the usage of various punctuation marks, I would hesitate to call this book instructional or label it a reference manual.  Instead, it's more of an entertaining read for those individuals who feel exasperation when they come across the misuse (or absence) of apostrophes, commas, hyphens, and the like--these readers certainly will find a kindred spirit in Truss.
B00003CX9E|5.0|AFI recently rated its top 100 movies of all time. The list has some occasional questionable rankings, but nonetheless, gives credit where credit is due. Citizen Kane was ranked #1 on that list. Is it the best movie ever? In my opinion, not hardly. But it is a marvelous work of film and is certainly worth taking the time to watch.<br />The story is of the life of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. At a young age, Charlie Kane rises from poverty and takes control of a virtually unknown newspaper chain. In an attempt to become a citizen of the people, he strives to popularize himself with the public and provide more and better information than his lofty competitor. But in the end, Charlie Kane dies in his extravagant statue-laden palace of Xanadu, alone and unhappy.<br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie is that it avoids the traditional chronological timeline that many movies follow. Instead, it follows through a series of flashbacks among Kane's closest friends and acquaintances as they divulge their information and experiences of Kane to a reporter seeking to gain insight about the recently deceased and highly influential man. The timeline is frequently disrupted, a style of movie making that has become more and more popular in recent years, and the movie throws the viewer into a number of important periods of Kane's life as being told by the various people interviewed by the reporter. The reporter that seeks to learn more about Kane learns that his dying words were &quot;Rosebud&quot;, but despite his frequent inquiries, he is unable to ascertain who exactly Rosebud is. Ultimately, the reporter never learns the true nature of Rosebud, but the viewer learns of the secret in the film's final scene as Kane's childhood sled is seen smoldering in a furnace, the word Rosebud painted on it. The question to the viewer then becomes: What is it about Rosebud that was so important to Kanein the end? It is, in my opinion, his nostalgia and longing for the days of innocence of his childhood. As a child, with no cares or worries in the world, Rosebud ultimately symbolized the happiness he felt at that period in his life, despite his impoverished state of living. As a dying man, he was unhappy, alone, and living in a state of perpetual despair, even with all of his luxuries and incredible wealth. And although the reporter never learns of the nature of Rosebud, he does in fact obtain his true goal of learning about the incredible life that was led by Charles Foster Kane.<br />The technical perfection and excellence that is associated with this movie is indeed profound. Camera angles, lighting, and other marvels of movie-making which I am not overly familiar with are still readily apparent to the amateur viewer. Focusing on the technical aspects of the film, one can surely appreciate the attention to detail that Welles put into making this extraordinary masterpiece and appreciate the aesthetic qualities that it exudes. <br />This movie was indeed way ahead of its time and is still thoroughly loved and marveled at by movie lovers to this very day. Despite its criticims from the common, shallow, popcorn munching, &quot;more explosions and FX, please&quot; movie watcher, this movie is an incredible work of art and worth seeing by anyone that appreciates superb film-making.
0446677450|2.0|While I found the stories appealing at first, if you dig deeper into the book the message becomes evident:  &quot;You too can become rich with these simple techniques.&quot;  In this sense it is no better than a get rich quick infomercial.  The sad truth if there was such a simple formula to making money, everyone would do it.  Just keep this in mind while reading or considering the purchase of these types of books.

6304233639|1.0|Yesterday in France, where I live, they projected this movie on the TV's 1st channel. Frankly, It's difficult to find a film that would be as stupid and pretentious as Independence Day. People who made this movie must be simply a little bit sick.<br />Just look at the story: US Independence Day becomes the Planet's Independence Day due to the awareness and courage of US people; other countries survive because they follow US salutary instructions.<br />I addition you have:<br />- Ridiculous protagonist's acts and dialogues<br />- Cartoonesque (at best) representation of characters<br />- Over-abundance of cheap rally-around-the-flag propaganda<br />This film should never exist.

B00005JM02|5.0|After &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, its becoming more and more doubtful that Pixar knows how to make a bad film.  Following &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, and &quot;Monster's Inc&quot;, and &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;(which, though good, was outshined by the similar animated film that year, &quot;Antz&quot;), Pixar seems unable to do wrong.  Finding Nemo follows a father's search to find his son who was snatched by a scuba diving dentist.  During his seemingly impossible search, he runs into a fish with short term memory loss, Dori(who is played astoundingly well by Ellen DeGeneres).  What follows is a surprisingly sweet, gentle, and funny film with spectacular animation.  This is a movie that you cannot aford to miss.
B00009Y3S9|5.0|The film Frida and the accompanying background material here is a visual entertainment that seems to be oriented to the current fascination with her art as an expression of inwardly turned, self-referential, and pyscholoigcal concerns. The acting, direction, and production design here are all masterful.<br />Yet, there seems to be a simplification to enable glorification.  Frida emerges as a saint, a heroine, but not a real person.  In fact, she seems unrecognizable compared with the versions of her life that were told and people who knew her before she became worthy of the same treatment as The Lion King. While lip service is paid to her disability and pain, one never sees the real pyschological expression of that pain that everyone who knew her talks about marking her personality. But then, this film seems to be faithful to current hipster's glib<br />reducation of Freida Kalho to a highly \\"collectable\\" stereotype.<br />People I knew who knew her 1938-1942 and the biographies that were written about her before she began to be taken up by the New York hipsters, tended to talk about how the pain and difficulty of her life were expressed in a personality that was not exactly the sweet, sunny, firm clear, fair and always just character portrayed in the movie. The condition created by the Frida Fad of the past 10 years has made her into such a non-person, such a glorified abstraction, that otherwise serious grownups who have no real knowledge other than she is now popular and \\"collectable\\" wince when you tell them people world wide for their warmth, judgement, and trust who saw her every day for years could say that Frida was not always fun to be around. No less than the Diego depicted in her film, Kahlo did not really understand the consequences her own personal picadillos and adventures could have on people who had more conventional views of life and love, and who needed stability in life.<br />The movie is either false or ignorant about why Trotsky moved out of the Blue House.  He did not move out because of Natalia Sedova's anger over the affair. [ The affair really break Natalia's heart and almost caused a split among the Trotskys, although that split was healed. Trotsky is almost rapsodic in his diary when he realizes his love for Natalya is there emotionally and physically and they are still together.] Trotsky and the Riveras split due to a deep and public political disagreement over elections in Mexico. Diego was making public statements that gave people the impression that Trotsky was backing a right-wing candidate for President of Mexico that Trotsky stridently opposed. Moroever, Diego's actions gave the false impression that Trotsky was publically intervening in Mexican politics, something Trotsky resolutely refused to do.  Both Trotsky and the Mexican section of the Fourth International, the world organization Trotsky founded, had to disassociate themselves from Deigo at this point.<br />This movie uses Kahlo's association with Trotsky to give a gloss to her and Rivera. Unlike the Mexican movie made about her entitled Freida (this is the name Kahlo was born with, not Frida), this film does not tell the view that in the late 1940s, Rivera and Kahlo became ultra-Stalinists.  They revived their friendship with David Alfred Siqueros who had attempted to murder Trotsky.  Frida Kahlo issued public statements denouncing herself for having had sex with Trotsky and pledged her eternal devotion to Stalin. Of course, this aspect of her life doesn't fit into the kind of marketable hagiagraphy that has less concern with the reality of a person and of politics than it does with a marketable image. It is true you do see a picture of Stalin on a canvas toward the end, but it is not clear to anyone who isn't already familiar with the story.<br />I also was disappointed in the actor they had playing Diego. He played his part extremely well, but he was just not the right person for anyone to think to be Diego. The person was an Englishactor, apparently of Italian or Spanish origin.<br />Diego was mostly if not entirely Indian, whereas Frida was actually half German Jewish.  Diego actually did the rough outlines and instructions of his murals and then got very indigenous Indians to paint in the colors with their rough brush strokes.<br />This attempt to identify with the non-European art and culture and political identity of Mexico was a big part of what Diego and Frida were about, but it gets no play or reference in the movie. Frida adopted the regional dress of one of the most indigenous areas of Mexico,rather than follow the Europe-centered fashions of Mexico's intelligensia. Mexico is a nation where the the vast majority, the scores of millions of people of mixed and all Indian blood have traditionally struggled against an elite which emphasizes its \\"Spanish\\" ancestry.  Diego's proclamation of his Indianness and his sucess in Mexico as a mostly Indian cultural figure, and Frida's decision to identify with this was central to their lives and impact on their times.<br />To me what is rather unfortunate is that while Kahlo's art was interesting and beautiful, and great in some ways, Diego is simply lost in all of this. He was one of the great artists of the 20th Century, far more significant than Kahlo in his impact on Mexican, Latin American, and world culture. Moreover, particularly for Mexicans and other Latin Americans, the cultural ideas about reclaiming the Indian identity and linking with the popular masses and the pre-Columbian cultures that he advanced were very important, not just for artists, but in political and literary circles as well. Diego played an important role fighting with his friend Andre Breton in charting an independent and radical artistic and intellectual response to Stalinist theory of \\"socialist realist\\" art.  Pathfinder Press has just come out with a brand new updated and better noted and glosseried edition of Breton's What is Surrealism which contains the declaration on Art and Artists in the 20th Century that Deigo, Trotsky, and Breton wrote together.<br />Of course, all of Deigo's work dealt with the political struggle of Mexico and the world's working people to fight against imperialism and capitalism. This isn't very marketable among the upper middle class fadists at whom this film seems to aimed. They prefer a Frida and a Diego whose personal concerns about romance, sex, and personal fame are at the center of their lives, not two fighters for a socialist world!ctor, apparently of Italian or Spanish origin.<br />Diego was mostly if not entirely Indian, whereas Frida was actually half German Jewish.

630529142X|3.0|This movie is very funny in some aspects, however it's very hard to laugh or enjoy in comparison to Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. I really loved Adam Sandler, however any movie made after Billy or Happy just seemed to lag off really badly, (i.e. Little Nicky, Big Daddy and various others)<br />I wasn't too thrilled with this one, except Kathy Bates, Blake Clark and Henry Winkler pretty much saved it from drowning (bad pun I know) in its own title. <br />I'm kind of disappointed with this movie, but I wouldn't say not to watch it or buy it because if you love stupid comedy like I do, then you'll like this. I'm more apt to rent it rather than own it (if I didn't own it already)
B00009V7T2|5.0|Absoluely the best cd I have ever heard. I love all types of music, but if your a fan of good rock music De-Loused in the Comatorium should definetly be in your cd collection.
B00006FDCD|1.0|when i first seen this movie, some of the parts were pretty good but the rest of the plot were really stupid. i mean come on these grown people are still scared and afraid about that stupid looking clown that doesnt even look scary??? how they even tried beating the crap out of him or even killing him??? this is the most stupidest movie i ever seen and there's movies more scarier than this one and it is so boring to watch too. and this movie isnt even scary not for me to say the least. if you want to watch true scary movies go buy The Exorcist. enough said about this film.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This has to be one of the best &quot;Vacation&quot; movies made yet. I cannot express this enough. It's definitly on my list of all time Christmas Classics, and you can still watch it throughout the year!<br />The &quot;Vacation&quot; movies really dig into almost any typical American's search to make the perfect vacation, life, experience for their family. Chevy Chase and Beverly DiAngelo just highlight it and make it all funny. I have had many friends and neighbors we could dub &quot;the Grizwolds&quot; over the years because of the bumbling things they've tried to do and these movies hit home, especially Christmas Vacation.<br />Buy it, love it!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This film,in my opinion,returns the Matrix to its roots:terrific visual effects,jaw-dropping action scenes,and a easy to follow story line.Hugo Weaving and,surprisingly,Keanu Reeves,turn in exceptional performances(Keanu actually cries during the death of one of the people he cares about dies)as Agent Smith and Neo,aka,Mr.Anderson.All in all,a terrific final chapter that more than makes up for Reloaded.I recommend it!
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is so cool!  The music is awesome and there are a ton of little, interesting details that sound really cool.  I really love the guitar.  If people have a problem with the vocals being female, get over it because girls can do anything boys can and do it better.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|There are two things I must point out before my review:one,don't expect this film to explain the events in the first film because this films starts off right into the action and two:pay attention to the dialogue. You will be lost in this film if you don't.Now on to the film:this film was good but,in my opinion,it just is not as good as the first or third films and is a tad too confusing. Still,it features some incredible visual effects and some amazing action scenes(the Burly Bawl is one such scene).I recommend it,but only if you liked the first one.Great film overall!
B000000WFU|5.0|I first came across the title track Adiemus when it was used in a statewide schools music exam and it entranced me (fortunately I was the supervising teacher not a student trying to do the exam!)<br />The phonetic use of vocals is very beautiful. Reminds me of the way Pat Metheny uses voices but in a different style.<br />Its not easy to find over here and everyone who hears my CD wants to get it. Also check out His &quot;Adiemus Variations&quot; for strings on the Diamond Music album.
B00000K19E|5.0|This film,in my opionion,is one of the greatest movies ever made!The visuals effects were great  at the time of this films' release and they still hold up well today.Also,unlike the sequels,this film makes sense! It is not confusing at all! too bad the sequels weren't like that. All in all,a great film! I recommend it!
B00003W8NM|3.0|I've realized how this film was well-executed, it entertains, and it makes you think.  So why only three stars?  Because it was based off a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, who - in my honest opinion - is basically a walking, talking advertisement for the Landmark Forum.  Far be it from me to knock the film on it's own merits, but I know many people in the world have taken &quot;Durden-isms&quot; to heart.  I've found that this film is realistically the anti-thesis to all of the philosphies abound in it, as we see the main character begin to drift away from his ideological contemporaries.  I feel as though this film, arm-in-arm with &quot;The Matrix&quot; (created by the Wachowski Bros - also members of the Landmark Forum), are indirect advertisements for the Landmark Forum, in that they undermine the value of subversion by betraying the respective 'revolutions' at the end of both plots.  The nearly apparent statement made here is that &quot;resistance is futile.&quot;  Not that I take Fight Club seriously as a philosphy, but I think I'll stick with my genuine appreciation for revolution and subversion, and not hand it over to a cult posing as a corporation so that it can pretend to be the &quot;cool&quot; place to be.
B000062XFG|5.0|The First Season of Star Trek: The Next Generation gave the show a firm foundation and a good block to build upon.  We saw a new Doctor in Kate Pulaski and it picked up right where the First Season left off.  Geordi LaForge has been promoted and is now serving as the Chief Engineer, Data's qualifications for being a lifeform are questioned, and argueably the best villain in Star Trek is introduced.  Unfortunately, there are 22 episodes in this season instead of the normal 26 episodes due to a Writers' Guild strike, however, the season finishes strong and gives another block for the upcoming savior of Star Trek third season.  Though short, Season Two is a great season in this show.<br />Personal Favorite Episodes,<br />Where Silence Has Lease, Elementary, Dear Data, The Outragous Okona, Loud as a Whisper, The Measure of a Man, Contagion, The Royale, Time Squared, Q Who?, The Emissary, Peak Performance
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Dianne Keaton and Jack Nicholson are on fire in this new romantic comedy.  Finally a movie has been made for the over 50 crowd.  Ironically it can appeal to anyone, not just seniors.  I had so much fun watching this film.  Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and Keany Reeves highlight the supporting cast.  The film may be a tad offensive to the older folks, but it is completely likeable.  Keaton reprised the Annie Hall type role once again, and Jack Nicholson plays a cooky Hugh Hefner type.  I applaud this film.  All Rom. Comedy film fans should see it.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Let me get one thing straight: all those who gave this CD a bad review were expecting to hear Robert Johnson. You want RJ? Get yourself the complete recordings of RJ.<br />This is Eric Clapton interpreting Robert Johnson and I think he did an admirable job. There are plenty of new wave acoustic blues guys who do standard acoustic note-for-note replays of Mr Johnson's work. What Eric did is take the general mood of the tune and update it somewhat and give it his own little signature twist.<br />What you get in the end is a highly enjoyable blues recording.<br />Okay, Me &amp; the devil may not sound as haunting as when RJ sings it, but to accuse this record of sounding bland and white bread is doing it injustice.<br />Hope Eric releases more of these beauties in time to come. He really has his own voice in playing the blues, with instantly recognizable guitar lines.<br />Maybe he should consider doing an all-blues live tour?<br />4/5 for me. 5/5 I reserve only for quintessential recordings.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am so happy that musicals have made it back to the Hollywood spotlight.  Chicago is a new musical classic from the 21st Century.  The movie seems old even as if it was made in the golden years of MGM or Warner Brothers.  The acting was superb, the music was great, and the songs were addictive.  It is a very fast paced, sexy, vibrant outburst of crime and jazz in the 20s.  Renee Zellweger played the sweet innocent Roxie Hart.  Richard Gere plays another millionare, but this time he is a singing one.  My favorite acting from the film came from Queen Latifa, who played Mamma Morton, and Catherine Zeta- Jones who played the gruff and bold Velma Kelly.  All around the movie was awesomely put together.  It all blended into a fantastic film.  One of the best musicals ever.
0803723865|5.0|This was a gift to my daughter a few months ago.  She recently turned two and asks me to read this book at least three times a day.  She loves all the characters in the book and even identifies the mushrooms, pinecones, woodpecker...  and she now says \\"Amazing!\\" and \\"Astounding!\\"  She can also describe the gruffalo in great detail, just like the book does.  I plan to give this as a present to all her cousins!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|A HIT......A FEW SONGS WERE SKIPPED, BUT OVERALL.....ANOTHER HIT. #9 IS HOT!!!!!!!
B00005JMX4|5.0|That's all can I say. I have seen the film in England (where I live) and it is absolutely hilaric. I was laughing from begining to end.... Crazy!....Soundtrack is really appropriate as well. Cracking film!
0385510438|5.0|My reaction to Grisham's recent books has been varied.  In &quot;The Summons&quot; and &quot;The Brethren&quot;, he seemed to have grown bored of his own writing, whereas &quot;A Painted House&quot; and &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; were attempts at new and great things.<br />&quot;The Last Juror&quot; starts off with a long character sketch, as though Grisham didn't have a better way to kick things off, but then he speeds us into a gripping story.  He introduces us to some memorable characters, and, as always, his dialogue and insights into human nature are superlative.  We witness a murder and the resulting trial through the eyes of a green newspaper editor.  We come to love and despise some of the townspeople.<br />And we wait for the dreaded moment when the murderer gets paroled, vowing revenge on his trial jurors.<br />If Grisham had skipped the whole second part of the book, he would have done nothing to disturb the plot.  The book would qualify as a breakneck thriller.  Instead, he spends a number of chapters providing a look at small town life in the early 70s.  War, racism, and capitalism are tackled--with commendable wisdom, yes--but the story drags.  Once we wade through to the third part, the story takes off again.  And Grisham adds a believable twist at the end.<br />I put this one down feeling that it was one of his best ever, save the social exposition in the middle section.  &quot;The Last Juror&quot; will not be Grisham's last word. Thank heavens!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|I admit that I'm an Eric Clapton fan from forty-some-odd years back, before Cream. But I'm disappointed. This is an OK album, worth about 2-1/2 stars. <br />The biggest problem is that this album is that it doesn't offer much variety. I go way back on the blues, but it the songs on this album all start sounding the same to me. <br />And isn't this deja vu all over again? Isn't the 11th song on this album &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot; from the Cream album???? Sounds identical to me.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|I have to begin this review by stating that I wanted very much to dislike this album. This feeling was based solely on the (in my opinion) lackluster &quot;From the Cradle&quot;. I feared that Mr. Clapton would repeat his past mistake, namely trying to alter his voice to sound like an &quot;authentic&quot; blues singer.<br />While there is a little bit of that on Me &amp; Mr. Johnson, for the most part the vocals sound like Clapton singing, and not Clapton mimicking Robert Johnson. The musicianship on the album is spectacular, despite some tired and overused arrangements (ie Possession over Judgement Day.)<br />Finally, while trying to remain true to the original verse, Clapton just can't carry off some of the lyrics. I guess its just that a middle aged financially stable white guy probably doesn't have the same life experiences as a Delta Blues singer from the early 1900's!<br />If nothing else, hopefully this album will draw its listeners toward Robert Johnson's original recordings; and there they will truly hear a hauntingly great musician who was far ahead of his time.
B00005JMEW|3.0|OK but not as impressive as the viewers claim. The actors don't even know how to hold a sword properly (not to mention posture) and that's a shame because even I can wield a sword much better than any of them. (I've been practicing Kendo for \\"only\\" 3 months.) What a shame that this is all they can do after rigorous training. Also the story didn't flow well due to bad editing. This film is all about watching cool stuff and nothing else. I'm aware that this is a post-modern film, exploiting some elements from films made in the past, but this film is not a good movie.<br />P.S. France=England?? You all know that's not true. Then why China (Hong Kong)=Japan?? Tarantino doesn't certainly understand a thing about the differences between two.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I don't get this.  A few months ago when the Alien Quadrilogy was released everyone called it a milestone in presentation and one of the best DVD boxed sets out there.  It was and still is.  It included the original and special edition of all four Alien movies and spanned 11 DVDs in length and included uncoutable extras for each film.  Lucas, on the other hand, has decided to release this sub-par boxed set that only gives customers the special edition of each Star Wars film and not nearly as many extras.  It is a compromised set for what otherwise could be another great piece in your DVD collection.  I'm gonna pass on this one in the hopes that the original versions will be released sometime in the future.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I must admit, I hadn't heard of this band before the Ipod commercials. Once I found out who they were and what they sounded like I ran as fast as i could to buy this album. These Aussies have brought back the true definition of Rock with their album \\"Get Born\\"! Personally I think their best tracks are \\"Lazy Gun\\" and of course their two radio singles \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" and \\"Cold Hard Bitch.\\" I enjoy their slower ballad-like songs as well, but there's nothing like the fast paced garage rhythm of the upbeat tunes! Obviously i encourage anyone to go out and by this cd and support a new undeniable talent!
B000060P79|5.0|An awesome punk album. It's not the poser trash people are sayin it is. It's real punk of today and I find it way better than the Sex Pistols. They had no talent. Buy this awesome CD NOW!!!
0446677450|5.0|This book is simple, easy to read and straight to the point. It contains very valuable financial advice that is simplified and supplemented with examples. The perfect book for beginners, ages 15 to 30, and even new investors of all ages.
B00008OLYN|4.0|One has to admire Opeth's courage in crafting an album like Damnation. As a band founded on balance between heaviness and delicate beauty, the last thing you'd expect them to do is go out and create an album that's totally mellow. Nonetheless, that is Damnation - a beautiful (as always) collection of almost exclusively acoustic and clean electric songs. Mikael Akerfeldt's clean voice is at its most impressive and his songwriting craft is wonderfully tight. No track clocks in at over 8 minutes, an unusual achievement for a band that routinely writes songs in the double digit time figures. And make no mistake at all, there are moments of pure beauty - most notably the entire 4:30 of Hope Leaves, one of Opeth's finest moments.<br />However, with the absence of heavy parts it seems as though a bit of Opeth's soul is not present here. Certainly Damnation is a satisfying listen in moderation, and a brilliantly crafted rock album. But by comparison to earlier Opeth works like My Arms Your Hearse or Blackwater Park, Damnation just doesn't hold up under the strain of repeated listens. The surprises don't pop out, and there isn't much of a sense of release a lot of the time. A longtime Opeth fan might be tempted to go back to those earlier records to get that sense of release and completion that this one ultimately lacks.<br />Damnation is still a brilliant rock album, and one likely to appeal to a broader cross-section of music listeners than any of the previous Opeth records. Those who loved those older albums, however, may be disappointed. Recommended tracks: Windowpane, Weakness, and especially Hope Leaves.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones is no doubt a distinct and unique artist.  Comparing this album to her last, it is different but in a good way.  I didn't find it as too country as some reviews here, but rather a smooth blending of jazz, bluesy, and country.  The first album was more jazz like but i wouldn't say it's solid jazz, but more of a pop jazz kind of way, yet unique.  This album takes a different direction but the way Norah Jones blends in her unique style with the help of her band is amazing. This album definetly doesn't sound popish.  Some may not like this CD because of it's relaxed sound but if you listen carefully the blending of the lyrics and the acousitc instruments are just fabulous.  Norah Jones is one of a few great artists that comes along rarely these days.
B0001IN080|1.0|Don't expect this DVD to be of the same &quot;high standards&quot; as Michael's studio productions, it is just the opposite.  The songs are presented in MTV-Video type style, with edits staying no longer than two seconds on a single scene, oftentimes audio and video is interwoven from different performances.<br />While this &quot;shock and awe&quot; approach might work for hip-hop music it totally destroys the balance and intimacy that the material calls for (and that Michael prides himself in being passionate about), and ultimately doesn't do his talent much justice.<br />The whole package is clearly a filler product with the CD simply rehashing live peformances of the DVD (and adding two new studio recordings recorded for his debut album).  The only revelation is provided in the form of three bonus videos, which show Michael and his band in the studio.<br />Production values of the DVD are below par, picture oftentimes grainy and shaky, and the producers didn't even bother with surround sound or anamorphic widescreen presentation!  A huge disappointment for fans of the Canadian crooner, as the DVD fails to capture the magic of his live performances.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|The creaking of a bow overhead and the thundering of cannons all around you, the senses are bombarded in a DVD which arrived this week.<br />Fox Home Entertainment's transfer of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is so vividly presented in both audio and video quality that the studio undoubtedly wanted viewers to feel as if they had taken to sea themselves for all of its 138-minute running length.<br />Based on the acclaimed novels of Patrick O'Brien and his hero Royal Navy Officer Jack Aubrey the plot concerns his Ahab-like obsessive quest to track down the French Privateer Archeron across the oceans of the world.<br />In command of H.M.S. Surprise the British ship seems an unsuitable match for their quarry. The enemy vessel has greater firepower and is seemingly impervious to cannons fired from Aubrey's battery. It becomes clear after the first engagement between the two that Aubrey  is going to have to rely on his wits to outwit his adversary.<br />Down the coast of South America, around the vicious Cape Horn and north to the Galapagos Islands the Captain stays doggedly on the tail of the Archeron, narrowly missing his own destruction until the final heart pounding confrontation.<br />Australian director Peter Weir holds no punches in his portrayal of life aboard an early nineteenth century warship and Russell Crowe along with his \\"Beautiful Mind\\" co-star Paul Bettany both give sterling performances as the Captain and his best friend Ships Surgeon Stephen Maturin. Simply put \\"Master and Commander\\" is a triumph of movie making and arguably one of the best movies to be put out by a major studio in recent years.<br />Similarly the DVD holds no punches presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio in a fine transfer. Color accuracy is excellent and edge halos have been eliminated.<br />The movie is available in both a single disc edition and a special two-disc edition with a generous selection of extras.
B00008O31H|5.0|The Black Keys are two guys from the American mid-west, hard as it to believe that only two people make this thick, rich audio gumbo.  They play the blues, post-modern blues with licks of psychedelia and rockabilly, white mid-west blues, punk blues.  They write original music, even though you'll swear some of those songs have got to be fifty or sixty years old.  Can two white kids from Akron, Ohio play the blues with anything like conviction?  Oh, yeah.<br />Patrick Carney plays drums, and he plays them heavy, the kick-drum thuds into your stomach, the cymbals are muted like they're coated with years of cigarette smoke from greasy clubs and roadhouses.  This guy ain't a showoff drummer, he's a hold down the groove until you find yourself breathing in time sort of drummer.<br />Dan Auerbach plays guitar like he's stringing barbed wire, through an old Ampeg amplifier that is one gig short of meltdown.  And he sings like he's done time in Mississippi jails, impossible, this guy is in his early twenties, where did he get the chops to stream that kind of pain through his voice?  Can he write a blues lyric?  \\"She want to get out the car, in the middle of the road, her screamin' and hollerin', it's getting mighty old,\\" yup, he can.<br />This album reeks of cigarette smoke and beer and gasoline fumes, the whole tone reminds me of Exile on Main Street, it's gritty and earthy, three a.m. blues when the band is past caring about the audience and just playing their pain away.<br />So, The Black Keys, with a guitarist who sounds like he's channeling Elmore James and a drummer who sounds like an idling Chevy 327 with bad lifters are now on Fat Possum records, the real deal.  Their music is thick enough to chew, it tips its hat to all the right forefathers(...).
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentiin Tarantino is fantastic as a director. When searching through the features i found out it was missing his commentary<BR>which i wanted to hear but the movie was awesome and the making of featurette was cool. i strongly reccomend this movie.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Monsters, Inc. is one of Disney's best movies they have made in a while. Whoever, came up with this idea was truely genius and had alot of imagination. Mike and Sully were the true stars of this movie, along with the voices behind them. The two of the voices matched each of the characters personalities and characteristics perfectly! Roz, was absolutely hilarious, my favorite line is &quot;I'm watching you Wasowsky always watching you!&quot;. Boo also was very believeable when she dressed up as a monster. The scariest part I felt was the part where they were trying to suck the screams out of Boo and the rest. <BR>This is one of my favorite movies along with Finding Nemo. I think this is because the same guy wrote both. This writer is very creative and I cant wait to some more of his works.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|This album seems to be a warm up for Nas,s new album streets disciple to realease. This  remasterd version would basicly be the oringinal Illmatic if nas diddn't add the 2nd disc. The remixed versions of the songs nas did just blew me away.His new tracks are ok, like on the real is really good but Im not really feeling star wars. I think that the only downfall to this album is that nas  diddn't remix all of the songs from illmatic. In my opinin that would of made the album hotter.Go cop the album if your a NAS fan and you collect his albums and  you want snack to hold you until Streets Disciple comes out.
B000002UA0|5.0|Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the greatest album of all time (along with Zeppelin I, which is of a very different flavor).  What makes Piper so unique is the way the music actually is a story in itself, supported by Syd's imaginative lyrics.  One good example is in &quot;Flaming&quot;, when Syd says &quot;Ever so high....&quot;, the music actually ascends, the vocals signaling the rising action of the instruments.  Another singularly brilliant aspect of the album are the dreamy psychedelic codas at the end of many of the songs.  For those of you who don't know, Syd named this album after a chapter in Kenneth Grahame's story, The Wind in the Willows.  It is a brilliant chapter, and offers some insight into the feelings that may have inspired Syd's music.  Listen to the album a few times, read the chapter, and listen to it again.  If you don't have the book, just search for the chapter on google.  It's there.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Though many of U2's fence sitting fans jumped ship for this album, they may want to take another look at U2's artistic stab at the lighter side.  In fact, this album really does stack favorably to it's more heralded immediate siblings.  The younger, All that you can't leave behind, is a fantastic back to basics tug on the reigns but it is not the album that Pop is.  the older, Zooropa is also fine but a little too directionally challenged for my liking.  Is Pop another Actung or Joshua Tree? No, but nothing ever will be.  Enjoy Pop for all of it's own personal greatness.  You won't regret it
B0001AP12G|5.0|One of the best hip hop CDs I've heard in a long time. &quot;He's a real soulful dude...&quot; His lyrics have a universal truth--pure and honest--and people can relate to them. The beats are phenomenal too!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Simply a fun romp through this genre. If you look at the trilogy as  birth, life, and death you can see why this one matches is the frenetic intensity of being alive.<br />If you don't like myth building and action, put this movie down and slowly back away...
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonce is obviously talented. She has written and produced Destiny's Child's greatest hits and when the group had problems and was about to disappear, Beyonce kept it together. Of course she's hated: she's strong, beautiful, powerful and extremely TALENTED, with an amazing voice. But this album is just a confused mess, there are a few good tracks but they're not enough to make it a real good album.....it's very disappointing, she has the talent to make great music but I can't hear any talent on this album....I still love her though and hope she'll come back stronger than this.
6303433766|4.0|This movie, based on a true story, and set in New Zealand, during the 1950's; features the introductory performances of Kate Winslet (of numerous movies) and Melanie Lynskey (currently seen as Rose in Two And A Half Men).  It's a disturbing movie, about an &quot;unnatural&quot; friendship that develops and the &quot;fatal&quot; consequences for the mother of Lynskey's character.  As the two young women plot their murder, they develop a fantasy world; populated with older movie and music stars; including Orson Welles and Mario Lanza.  The man portraying a young Orson Welles was particularly, and unncanny was his resemblance, well cast. It was fairly sensual in places, which surprised me; given that there was little, if any nudity, although according to Craig Hosada, of the book &quot;The Bare Facts Guide&quot; there is, but it's brief, and may have been &quot;lost&quot; to &quot;modification&quot; for the smaller screen.  This doesn't detract too much from very emotional performances, by Winslet and Lynskey, [which made there characters very sad, at times, as they yelled and cried a lot] but also made them strangely sympathetic.  Winslet was clearly the more &quot;sophisticated&quot; one, but Ms. Lynskey held her own, as the plain[er] looking, but equally strange, highly emotional, young woman.  I'm not sure if a sequel would be in order, given that each is doing many different things now, but it would be an interesting idea to see them &quot;several years on&quot;.  Overall, not a bad film, not a great film, and certainly a place to start for both of them.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I think I've said enough. What more is there to say? Pure Brilliance.
0345440900|2.0|This book was less than &quot;average&quot;.  However, this is a book that I believe to be written for the parents who are in need of immediate assistance in parenting their newborns.  The book was a waste of my precious time.  As all new parents can relate- they don't have time as they bring their newborns home, experience sleep deprivation, heal from the labor and feed every 2-3 hours.  The content in the book was basic common sense or information I had already learned from birth classes offered at my hospital during pregnancy.  It was a waste of my time and money to read 276 pages that could have been summarized in a few page essay.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Never a more dissappointing sequel will you ever see.  Not since the addition of Jar Jar Binks to Star Wars has a movie's plot line suffered such a budget cut on the alter of special effects. Buying this movie simply sends a message to hollywood that you don't want any stories in your movies.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|Wow! I'm disgusted at how rudely people are reacting to this CD and band. If it works, it works. It doesn't matter if they get their inspiration and sound from other bands. You don't have to take your snobbery pills and bash the hell out of this stuff. If I didn't like something, I wouldn't write a review, or would calmly explain my distaste in a polite manner. I, personally, really like this band and CD beCAUSE they remind me of the days when rock rocked. Some of the ballads are a little taxing to listen to all the way through after a few rotations, but this CD is still a rockin' piece of plastic. I recommend it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a sci-fi buff I have watched plenty of series in recent memory (next generation, deep space 9, voyager, lexx, dark angel, farscape, stargate), and would have to say that the only one that might compete with firefly since next generation is farscape.  Missed firefly when it was on TV, but watched an episode off of the school network and bought the DVD's that week, have watched them through twice in about 6 weeks (which is exceptionally rare for me) and am anxiously awaiting Serenity, and hoping it is aired.  With all the crap on sci-fi no (tremors, scare tactics...) here's hoping that they bring back farscape (mini-serious is coming) and that someone picks up firefly after the movie.  Note, have watched buffy from the beginning and last season or 2 of angel, so firefly isn't the only Joss show I like, but I think it had/has the potential to be the best.
0486408434|5.0|Best introductory/intermediate book to card magic ..<br />Book I say,  I think for me at least the  DVD/videos out there that display actual sleights are a better tool.<br />RRTCM has a few nice tricks in it also some that are older than the trees but they still amaze most laymen.<br />Once you get past the old trappings, the tricks stand the test of time .
B00004WEJZ|3.0|After watching the movie, and enjoying it, and then reading the mostly negative reviews, I will still admit that I actually thought it was a pretty good movie, and I will tell you why;<br />First of, at first I was extremly dissapointed by the lack of the gun barrel intro and familiar james bond theme. But then I realized that it actually was a breath of fresh air. The intro with the war games and the never say never theme song was quite memerable and cool to me. The intro gave the movie a jazzy, serious tone that appealed to me. If it had the usually intro, this movie would have no doubt been viewed as cheesy and b rate. The special effects with the b-1 and missiles were ground breaking at the time, and are still impressive by today's stadards in my opinion. The jokes at the begining of the movie were funny but were lacking near the end. Connery definenty looked the part.  The jazzy music was well made and catchy in my opinion. <br />If you're a Golgo 13 fan like me, you will understand why I liked this movie so much. but I can understand why Bond fans were dissapointed by this soupy version of the super-spy.
B0000691TJ|1.0|of course the best ramones albums are the first four which are absolutely essential classics, so i wasnt expecting much from this later offering, but i had just been pleasantly surprised by the strength of material on pleasant dreams and hope there might be a few decent stand out tracks, but the whole album sounds like filler, even the title track which is one of the better tracks. id recommend the first four albums and the anthology, then maybee end of the century and pleasant dreams, but i think by this point in their carreer they had lost there way a little.
B000065PUE|4.0|Alot of people would tell you that &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; is their best offering, and I really like &quot;Bossanova&quot;, but most should say &quot;Doolittle&quot; is their peak, because it is. Truth be known, this album probably kickstarted the whole &quot;alternative&quot; explosion as much as &quot;Nothing's Shocking&quot; or &quot;Nevermind&quot; may have. It probably influenced more people too. This album might include a few of their most popular songs, but the greatness lies in tracks like &quot;Debaser&quot;, &quot;Wave Of Mutilation&quot;, &quot;La La Love You&quot;, and &quot;Gouge Away&quot;. Of course everything here rocks, like most of what they've done. For bigger fans this is an absolute must, newcomers might just want to check out the new &quot;Best Of Pixies&quot; disc.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|The track where the Bride has escaped the coffin and is trudging along, dirt-covered, through the desert, is--I believe--Bernard Girard Christophe's &quot;The Sunny Road to Salina.&quot;  The track was recognized by fans in some of the earlier trailers and an mp3 was posted at one of the Kill Bill sites I frequent.  I really liked the track and was keeping an ear open for it while I watched the movie. Excellent placement.
B0000029DD|5.0|There's not alot of 5 star ratings out there, but \\"Grace\\" is easily one of those. I think anyone who knows it probably has trouble describing how amazing it is to others. More than anything else there's his voice, which I would call angelic. From highs to lows it's pretty much perfect. But the music is also impressive, just as good, and is also very moving. Much of the album is very rock, and they do that well, but much of it is also very delicate and peaceful, and has been mastered as well. \\"Jeff Buckleys\\" death in the Mississippi river was indeed tragic, but not hearing this piece of work would be too. Again, 5 stars.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is simply the best show on Broadway right now! While there are a few songs that don't shine on this CD, Defy Gravity, Popular, Dancing Through Life and What is This Feeling? truly stand out! Totally worth it!
B000002OK3|3.0|I'm more a fan of the film, but still decent tunes on here. Truthfully, these 16 tracks contain just 8 songs, the rest is dialogue from &quot;Steven Wright&quot; and others, and amusing just a listen or two. To be honest, unless this is your favorite movie ever, I think you'll find half of these songs annoying, and the only ones I really enjoy are &quot;Fool For Love&quot; and &quot;Stuck In The Middle With You&quot;. The rest have been overplayed to death. I like the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; disc more, but still only play that once a year. I'll tell you which &quot;Tarantino&quot; soundtracks are excellent though: &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and &quot;True Romance&quot;.
B00003CX9E|2.0|Long, boring, pointless, ridiculous.    Orson Welles : He wrote, produced, directed, and starred in Citizen Kane...    ......Aaaaaaaand?.......    Big deal. Oh, so he was 25 at the time? Who cares? The movie is overrated beyond anything you can imagine. Yes, I do like character studies. I do prefer dialogue over fight sequences. I don't care about action and explosions, you freakin elitist morons.    #1 film of all time? Sh'yeah right. There's literally HUNDREDS of better films out there. This was one time the Oscars actually got it right. How Green Was My Valley completely lynched every single Oscar from this so-called \\"masterpiece\\". Best Director, best cinematography... hehe. Sorry, Welles, old chap. You got a little too slap-happy, there. And no, I am not a trendy MTV-nerd. I watch a lot of Fellini, Herzog, Kurosawa and Kubrick. I'm not saying that makes me some sort of important and superior film buff or anything (it really doesn't, actually), but I just wanted to make it clear that I do NOT watch Michael Bay and Paul Anderson movies. The Third Man was much better. Citizen Kane is just boring tripe.    I don't care about his stupid @55 sled.
B00008H2LB|4.0|When these guys first appeared with Hybrid Theory, they were simply amazing. Reanimation was nothing and Meteora is just good.<br />Foreward: Doesn't count, just and intro<br />Don't Stay: 8/10 - Pretty good opening song, fast and crazy. Gets old after a while though, and definately not as good of an opening as Papercut. Typical song with Chester taking over with his melodic screaming.<br />Somewhere I Belong: 9/10 - Great song. Great rapping, lyrics, and just overall sound. Awesome bridge too. First single.<br />Lying From You: 9/10 - Another great song. Chester's screaming is awesome and the bridge is cool too. Fourth single.<br />Easier To Run: 7/10 - Good and emotional, but just doesn't sound like Linkin Park.<br />Hit the Floor: 7/10 - OK, but not really catchy. Great lyrics though.<br />Faint: 9.5/10 - Just purely awesome song. Fast and heavy. Awesome drumming, guitar, and bass playing. Chester's screaming is just superb on this one. Great bridge. And just a fantastic song. Second single.<br />Figure.09: 8.5/10 - Great song. Great screaming, rapping, and awesome bridge. Should have been a single.<br />Breaking the Habit: 6/10 - Just not very good... Good lyrics though.<br />From the Inside: 8/10 - Pretty good song. Could blend some more rapping with it though. It's still pretty good though.<br />Nobody's Listening: 6/10 - Oh yeah, good rap song, but c'mon. Linkin Park ain't about rap. That's not what made them a great band. It's the fusion of rap AND rock.<br />Session: 8/10 - Wow. Even though it doesn't go and it's all instrumental. It's pretty good.<br />Numb: 9.5/10 - Amazing song. Just amazing. Emotional, believable, great melody, lyrics, and everything. Not quite as good as In the End though. Third single.<br />Originality: 9<BR>Lyrics: 10<BR>Sound Quality: 8<BR>Musicianship: 8<BR>Album Art: 6<BR>Overall: 8<br />Overall it's a pretty good CD. Not as good as the first though. Hybrid Theory could possibly be one of the greatest CD's ever. Not Meteora though. I think they just tried to hard. But I can't blame 'em. How do you make a follow up to somethin like Hybrid Theory?
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is excellent! Everything from acting, directing to the storyline. One thing to mr. Tomas (earlier reviewer): Lenny did in fact have a tattoo reminding him of his condition. It was in the most often seen place, on his hand! It said &quot;Remember Sammy Jankis!&quot; reminding him of the ex-customer with the same condition. Also, you probably missed the point on &quot;conditionilizing&quot; the memory, so even when you don't remember something, when it gets repeated long enough, your brains get conditionalized to it.
B00004Z459|4.0|Wow. When these guys started, they really started... All I can really say is amazing.<br />Papercut: 9.4/10 - A great opening song. Fast paced, great music and all.

Still excellent though. Rock on Linkin Park
B00005S6K8|5.0|\\"i have owned both versions of Sabrina for a few years. i find myself rewatching the remake over and over again. i adore audrey hepburn (having watched every movie she was in) but I feel that the 1954 version is a little dated and in need of a re-make. if you had to remake a movie, why not Sabrina. this re-make is a visual delight, with scenery and settings so apt for the occasion. throughout this movie, i never for one moment wondered what it would be like if audrey hepburn had played the part in this one. julia ormond's performance was seductive and credible. she was perfectly cast for the part. I agree with the reviewer who said that julia ormond should be the actress for \\"The Audrey Hepburn Story\\" which I would not recommend anyone to see, not Jennifer Love Hewitt. I checked out other Julia Ormond films, investing in the purchase of Smilla's Sense of Snow, Legends of the Fall, Nostradamus and have always found that a rewatch of Ormond's Sabrina was a better use of time than watching her other films. I have always wondered why Julia Ormond made so few films and so little is known of her. I would have liked to see more of her in films where an audrey hepburn calibre actress was called for. incidentally, audrey was hepburn's film name. Audrey was originally Edda (refer to special features in My Fair Lady).\\"
0790729725|3.0|This is my favorite mob movie of all time. Sure, many will argue that the Godfather is superior, but Goodfellas is the film of my generation. Since I love this film so much I have chosen to wait, impatiently, until the special edition dvd is released. I've heard that Warner Bros. will be releasing it in September 2004. My friend has the original dvd, and I have to say that the transfer is sub par. The sound quality is lacking and the disc must be turned over halfway through the film. If the heresay is true, then September will be a glorious month.
B00005V9IK|3.0|&quot;Independence Day&quot; could have been a great film.  It's got the huge explosions that draw in big summer crowds, it's loaded with fodder for popcorn popping, but after that...<br />Honestly, this isn't a terrible movie.  It will hold your attention for the entire duration of the film.  The visuals, especially the opening sequence showing you just how tiny the moon and our little neck of the universe can be, are fantastic.  The special effects are top-notch and the acting is over-the-top, loud-mouthed and fun.  The aliens are believeable enough and I liked the touch of Roswell thrown in to give the story a little substance.<br />However, things went downhill from there.  Now if you've read my review of Emmerich's &quot;Godzilla,&quot; you already know that I liked that movie.  But the reasons I liked it are the same reasons that I'm not overly fond of &quot;Independence Day.&quot;  Like the large lizard flick, the story has no originality to it whatsoever.  It's a blatant rip-off of all those old Sunday matinee sci-fi movies.  At least &quot;Godzilla&quot; had the decency to impregnate the title character.  Tons of buildings are destroyed in both films, but &quot;Godzilla&quot; more or less just toppled things over trying to hide from the baddies.  Only Madison Square Garden received any extra special attention.  In &quot;ID4,&quot; buildings were destroyed to show people just how nifty the special effects were.  The two biggest disappointments in &quot;ID4&quot; had to be the virus implanting ending(just too unbelieveable) and Will Smith.  Normally I like Mr. Smith, but he's just too annoying in this movie.  I found myself hoping that one of the aliens would have whacked him just to shut him up.<br />In closing, I have to say that this is a fun movie to watch if you like explosions, but for some reason, this movie doesn't click with me like &quot;Godzilla&quot; did.  I know they are different films, but they were created on the same larger-than-life scale.  &quot;ID4&quot; takes itself too seriously.  It's nothing more than a glorified cheesy sci-fi movie that's fun to watch, but just not fun enough.  For a better time, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has explosions galore, including some cool bug guts.  If that's not your speed, check out &quot;Armageddon.&quot;  It has that whole &quot;end of the world&quot; thing going for it.  Both of these movies don't take themselves too serously, and they are a lot more enjoyable to watch.  If that still doesn't fit your bill, break out the old Atari and play &quot;Space Invaders.&quot;  Now that's entertainment.&quot;ID4&quot; takes itself too seriously.

B00008O31H|5.0|At the risk of just echoing previous reviews, I feel that it is necessicary to emphasize what a breath of fresh air the Black Keys are.  Well, that's an ironic way of saying it, becuase this album will have you feeling like your sitting at a table in whatever smokey, dirty bar the Black Keys are playing at tonight.  At a time when Emo and other soft, cookie cutter &quot;rock-and-roll&quot; groups are dominating the charts, it's refreshing to know that there is a band out there that still wants to make music, not just money. The black keys are that to a T. They are all the hype.  They prove on this album that two talented musicians are better than four or five uncreative hacks.  In this era of subwoofers and bass emphasized music, you won't miss the lack of a bass guitar on this album.  For anyone who either misses, or is sorry they missed, the era of Jimmy Hendrix, Led Zepplin, and George Thorogood, your second chance has come along.  IF you buy this album, you WILL like it, if you like real music.  You don't have to like the blues, or classic rock, or any genre in particular.  You just have to like listening to two talented guys enjoy what they're doing on their instuments.
6305127646|5.0|I waited until recently to see The Saint. I'd heard that this was not like the novels and Saint fans wouldn't appreciate it. Nobody told me it was about the early days of The Saint. I watched it a few days ago with reluctance and was won over completely. What a wonderful movie! Shame on me for not watching this sooner. This is a grand adventure and Kilmer is quite good as the early Saint. Fans of The Saint should definitely see this film. I doubt that they will make a sequel, but I'd love to see Kilmer in The Saint In New York.
0385334206|5.0|Well, with 187 reviews to date, just about every angle has already been touched upon by previous reviewers on this site.  <br />I'll only add one more possible angle: reflect on yourself by using this book.  Some others have hinted at this also.<br />Example: Many reviewers who disliked the book, or liked it only tepidly, felt it was &quot;racist.&quot;  Well, in PC terms, of course, it is just that.<br />But that's not the point.  The point is, &quot;You&quot; feel that way.  Or you don't.  This is how Vonnegut's use of the &quot;n&quot; word and the stereotypes affected you: you got a little hot about it, or you didn't appreciate it, or you did appreciate it, or you thought it was funny.  How did you react to that?<br />And how did you react to the author as character in a novel?  It rarely happens, but Vonnegut did it well, I think.  It never gets phony, but it points to phoniness, as a potential, in us and in our love of fiction.<br />That's how I felt.  How did you feel?  Diximus.
B0000630YA|4.0|With this album, Alice was not content to showcase some of his all-time greatest songs, he did it with one of the hottest studio and live line-ups he ever had. The lead guitars were by Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, who had previously been the incendiary team on Lou Reed's 'Rock and Roll Animal'. But beyond this, this album shows Alice's sense of humour at it's best. This album is worth getting for the Vincent Price cameo on 'Black Widow' alone. As for 'Cold Ethyl', 'Only Women Bleed', and 'Department of Youth', well, you'd have to be made of stone not to chuckle everytime you hear them. Just great.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|&quot;The best thing about being an artist is that you get to travel overseas to places like Canada.&quot; ~Britney Spears<br />I'm sorry, but this piece of trash pop star is too stupid to take seriously. The only reason she's gotten anywhere is because she's hot, not because she's talented. <br />And you can go ahead and click &quot;no&quot; where it asks if this review helped you. I honestly don't care. I just need to warn all the people who want to hear some real music. There is no real music here. It is overprocessed bubblegum pop. The end!

0553583182|5.0|Another reviewer mentioned that the techniques outlined in this book are nothing new - I agree. This book definitely appeals to me because Dr. Murphy has taken universal or spriritual laws and explained them in a very simple manner. Dr. Murphy teaches the reader how to apply techniques such as autosuggestion. His clear, simple and practical methods motivated me to begin and continue to apply these techniques daily. I can truthfully say that by day and by night I am being prospered in all of my interests. <br />You'll like this book if you enjoyed Napoleon Hill's Think And Grow Rich. Many of the same pricipals can be found in Murphy's Power.<br />I'm interested in corresponding with individuals that are applying the techniques in this book and seeing favorable results.

0385510438|5.0|Using a small Mississippi town during the 1970s as a backdrop, John Grisham renders, what I believe, is his finest novel.<br />Unforgettable characters, traumatic events, unforeseen twists and a life-like conclusion combine to create this fast-paced read.  Too many of Grisham's books, in my opinion, conclude with forced endings.  It is almost as if the author is worn-out by the plot and his characters so he forces the story into an unreal finish.<br />That is not the case with this book.  Set in the south during desegregation, the end of the Viet Nam War and the beginning of suburban and rural sprawl, Grisham characters are believable.  They reflect the times in which they live.  They live; they die.  They enjoy success; they struggle with life's dilemmas.<br />This is not your typical Grisham novel.  I, for one, am grateful for that.  Novelists should grow with experience.  With this book, Grisham leaps from the category of \\"popular novelist\\" to \\"great writer.\\"
0375422307|5.0|This graphic novel is a masterpiece along the lines of Maus.  The medium helps convey the naive views of a child living through the Iranian revolution.  The outcome is a brillaintly subjective telling of a period of history and people that frequently gets oversimplified in a black and white world.<br />There are moral questions that do not fit so easily into clear right or wrong.  Is the corrupt government supported by the West really that much better than what was promissed by the revolution?  And what went wrong with the revolution?  Why is Iran the one middle eastern country besides Israel that has a pro-US street despite everthing?  Tough questions, but the book provides good clues.<br />The book is a very easy read, but delivers a stirring impact.  You'll find yourself finishing it in a matter of days, loaning it to a friend, and receiving it back within a week.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|(Not like this movie needs another review, but we're all here because we like the sound of our own words, right?)<br />I am not a huge Matrix-head, and not really an action-movie fan, either. I particularly have no patience for action sequences, CGI or otherwise, that just show off someone's moves without advancing the plot. (Example: I thought the freeway chase scene in &quot;Reloaded&quot; was an excellent time to go get some more Junior Mints.) For that reason it did not bother me at all that the grand climax fight scene in the rain was preposterous -- who cares? And for that reason I actually liked the battle in the dock of Zion -- it felt more like a good war movie of a city under attack, less like a gratuitous display of action.<br />On the whole I found Revolutions much more enjoyable than Reloaded. I agree with all those who said that the entire fabulous, original concept was pretty well worked through in the first movie, but at least this one was fairly straightforward, didn't trouble itself too much with philosophy, and had a nice sense of appropriate resolution. <br />I even found pleasure in the obviously derivative elements, if only because they helped me keep track of what was going on. For example, during the battle at the dock it occurred to me that this was the equivalent of the battle of Minas Tirith -- trying to keep the enemy at bay while Frodo/Neo is invading the enemy's territory, doing the real saving of the world.<br />But I still don't get what that Merovingian dude is all about.
B00000HZH7|5.0|Music itself is a progression and the metal genre is no different. When it comes to death metal, it has its roots in thrash with bands like Metallica, Slayer and Venom. Than it gets heavier with thrash bands who point the way to death metal like Kreator, Sodom, Destruction, Dark Angel and this band, Possessed who are the sign that leads to death metal with Death being the front door. It all starts with this album. This is one of the classic albums that influenced a lot of the early death metal bands like Cannibal Corpse and Vader. Those 2 bands have covered songs from this album. Cannibal Corpse covered The Exorcist. That version is on the Hammer Smashed Face EP. Vader covered Death Metal. That version is found on Future Of The Past. <br />Anyway, here's my review. This album has a lot of early death metal elements making it an album ahead of its time. Lets discrible it first by the music. The music is like a mix of Metallica's Kill 'Em All, early Slayer albums like Show No Mercy and early elements found in Death's Scream Bloody Gore. It's heavy, brutal, intense, evil and satanic. It has plenty of speed with some mid-80's style thrash but with death metal elements like blast beasts and rolling snare drum sounds. The vocals on the other hand sound a lot like the late Chuck Schuldiner (Death/Control Denied). Chuck has admitted in an interview that this album influenced him and you can tell just by listening to the vocals as well as the music. Some of the best songs here are The Exorcist, Burning In Hell, Evil Warriors, Seven Churches, Satan's Curse, Holy Hell, Twisted Minds and Death Metal. Buy this album and prepare for a joyride through Hell. You'll ejoy it.
630463949X|5.0|I First came across the CD of this concert a few years ago.My mother had it lying around the house for ages.Then for no reason i thought i'll try this for something new,and i have never turned back.I then bought the DVD and to my delight i found it had an extra five songs.It's Lindsey Buckingham's perfromance that will blow you away,and the version of I'm So Afraid is prob the best live version of a song I have ever seen.Until I heard this concert I had never even listened to a full fleetwoodmac album and now i own 15 albums and building plus I went to see them in the recent Say You Will tour.If your a new or old Mac fan buy this DVD it's the best ever.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Slayer albums in my collection. I bought it sometime in the Spring of 1995 as part of a first-time $100 spending spree which also included the purchaces of Broken Hope's Repulsive Conception, Morbid Angel's Domination and Magedeth's Killing Is My Business and Youthanasia. When I finally got around to listening to this album, like any and every Slayer album, it delivered.     Now before my review, I need to bring up something that's very important. The reason that I'm bringing this up is so that there is no confusion. There are 2 versions of this album in existence. The first is the triditional with all the tracks from Angel Of Death to Rainning Blood. That version is out of print and the only way to get a copy of it is at places like E-bay, Spec's/FYE (in the used CD section) or here at Amazon.com. Now, the other version is the one with the 10 basic songs along with a remake of Aggressive Perfector and a remix of Criminally Insane as bonus songs. Hold what I just said in your head for a minute.     Let me not forget to say that this review is a remodling of my old review of this album. At the time I did it, the only version of this album that was available was version #1. Now, version #2 is the only version available of this album. Let's also not forget that here at Amzone.com, there are certain albums that are out of print. They can only be available here as used CD's and sometimes as imports. Files for these dead albums are put online so that old fans can still write reviews on them despite them being out of print. Some albums get re-issued and some of the reviews written for these albums when they were dead can be added to reviews for the re-issues. Now back to what I was saying about the 2 versions of this abum. I already have both versions but since version # 1 is out of print, all of the reviews for this album in general are now centered only on version # 2. Since I do have both versions and the reviews for this album are only centered on version # 2, that version will be the one that I will review.     Now for my review. This is Slayer's fifth release but it's their first one on Def Jam or American Music. This means a new direction for the band from every angle. Slayer is one of my favorite bands of all time and this is one of those albums that proves that the indestructable power known as Slayer is for real. This is one of the best albums in the history of thrash metal and one of Slayer's best. This album has it all. It's heavy, brutal, intense, all-out, assulting thrash metal. It's has plenty of speed with some slow and medium parts but it's all heavy. The lyrics are still dark, evil and satanic but not satanic all of the time. There are still songs about Satan but there are also a variety of other subjects but everything is still dark. Some of those subject are about murder, diseases, revenge, death and religion being a waste of time. Those kinds of subjects will become the more focused themes in the band's future albums as they slowly leave the satanic imagery behind but this will in no way effect their music because they will always deliver. This album also has 2 bonus songs. One is a remake of an old song called Aggressive Perfector. This is not the version on the Haunting The Chapel EP. The sound and production are pretty much in vain of the rest of the album. The second bonus song is a remix of Criminally Insane. This is a different version from the original on the album. So I will let Slayer fans judge fore themselves. All in all, you get the whole Slayer package. The album is so good that it's very hard to choose a favorite set of songs because you will end up choosing every song on the album. So some of the best songs on here are Angel Of Death, Piece By Peice, Necrophobic, Altar Of Sacrifice, Reborn, Epidemic and Rainning Blood. Get this album and you shell reign in blood.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Being a Marilyn Manson fan for sometime, i really think this is his best album with fantastic songs like 1996 and tournicet. it really shows that hes not some stupid stoner but a really intelligent dark goth.every song is very dark and simply magnifesent. I also think this blows his fellow gothic rock bands lke slipknot and cradle of filth out of the water. Simply a must buy
B000002H33|5.0|This one of my favorite Metallica albums. I bought it on cassette in the spring of 1992. Right about this time, the Metallica train was at full momentum and going strong. The band was touring the world as well as gainging new fans while retaining old ones. Nothing could stop Metallica and it showed. So anyway, after getting Ride The Lightning, I went ahead and got this album, Master Of Puppets and like any other Metallica album, it delivered.    Now for my review. This is one of Metallica's best albums and it's the last one they made with bassist Cliff Burton, RIP. With this one, they still continue where Ride The Lightning left off but with a different sound and a whole lot of improvement. You still have those heavy, brutal, intense, all-out, thrashing, bashing, pulverizing riffs that the band is known for but there's also some serious musicianship, dynamics, melodies, accustic passages and magic moments. So this album has all of the basic, important elements that make the band who they are and a whole lot more. So no one will be dissapointed. Some of the best songs here are Battery, Master Of Puppets, The Thing That Should Not Be, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Orion and Damage Inc. Get it and get damaged.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie surfed on the blood of violence and nonsense.  The fatalities are overly exagerated.  It is unbelievable.  I can't believe that I wasted my money on this crap.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one of my favorite Metallica albums in my collection. I bought sometime in the spring of 1992. Right about this time, Metallica was quickly becoming one of the world's greatest bands. The Black Album was released and the band was touring the world and making a name for themselves and well as developing a new fan base while adding to their legions of long-time fans. I was a part of that new fan base and for me, it all starts with The Black Album but instead of going backwards, I went ahead and bought Kill 'Em All and worked my way foward. So after getting Kill 'Em All, next was this album, Ride the Lightnining. So where I got this album, look it home and listened to it, it delivered like only a Metallica album can.     Now for my review. This one of Metallica's best albums and it's a real heavy one. It's a little different from Kill 'Em All because it's not straight ahead thrash metal all the time. It's still has those heavy, brutal, intense, furious, thrashing, smashing, bashing, all-out, in-your-face, pulverizing metal riffs that Metallica could only deliver but there's also some dynamics, musicianship, melody, some accustic passages and magic moments. There's some slow and mid-placed songs as well as fast, brutal songs but it's all heavy and brutal. So no one will be dissapointed. It has it all. Some of the best songs here are Fight Fire With Fire, Ride The Lightning, Escape, Creeping Death and The Call Of Ktulu. Get this album and get shocked.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin did a spectacular job with this movie, its truely a tribute to all samurai movies and plus has a great plot any person who says its a rip off obvious ought to rethink what they are saying.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is one of Metallica's best albums and it's the first one with Jason Newsted. It's probably the band's longest record but still entertaining and heavy to say the least. Your still have those awesome killer riffs, musicianship, dynamics, solos, accustic passages and magic moments that every Metallica records has but it's always something along these lines but never anything boring. Every song is different and has it's own identity and this is the chemistry with any music Metallica makes. This album in particular is no different and it delievers like all Metallica records. Every song here is amazing, mind blowing and unforgettable. Some of the best songs are Blackened, ...And Justice For All, One, The Shortest Straw, Harvester Of Sorrow, To Live Is To Die and Dyers' Eve. Get it and get smashed by the hammer of justice.
B000002BFL|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this is the best album Bruce has ever made.  As I own practically every album he has released, I am speaking with some knowledge.
B000062YB1|5.0|This is my favorite Slayer album in my collection. I bought it on September 13th, 1993 (which was my 17th birithday) along with the puchaces of Sepultura's Arise and rap albums like Willie D's Goin' Out Like A Soldier and Bagnin' On Wax by Bloods & Crips. I bought all those albums on cassette and I took them home to listen to. When I got around to listening to this album, I played it and it delivered.     Now for my review. Every new Slayer album always means a new direction for the band. The music is still heavy, brutal, intense, furious, assulting thrash metal like Slayer can only deliver. There's plenty of speed songs, slow songs and medium-paced songs but there all heavy, all killer, all evil and all dark. You still get aggressive vocals, killer riffs, solos and drumming attacks. The lyrics are a mix of the satanic as well as the more realistic themes. So you get the best of both worlds. Just a reminder, the satanic lyrical content makes its way one last time on this album. The next release will be LIVE Decade Of Agression will be a live double album. After that, all of the albums that will follow will have no satanic content whatsoever. The whole Satan thing will be a dead issue as the more realistic themes become most of the focus of the band's lyrical content. Not to worry become this will certainly not change the music. The music will still be as aggressive as ever and Slayer will always be Slayer. Lets also not forget that this is the band's last album with Dave Lumbardo. After LIVE Decade Of Aggression, Paul Bastaph will take his place for the rest of the band's carreer until Dave comes back after God Hates Us All and the Soundtrack To The Apocalypse boxset. So this album is pretty much the end of an era into a brand new one and Slayer goes out with a bang. So this album pretty much delivers the total Slayer package. Some of my favorite songs here are War Ensemble, Spirits In Black, Dead Skin Mask, Hallowed Point, Skeletons Of Society, Temptation, Born OfFire and Seasons In The Abyss. Get it and take a ride through the abyss of Hell curtesy of Slayer. You'll enjoy yourself.
B0001I55OC|4.0|3 1/2 stars.    The amazon.com reviewers for this movie seem to be mostly of two types:  middle school kids and pseudo-intellectuals.  This is neither horribly acted, nonsensical trash, nor is it an instant classic/tour de force/best movie ever!!.  It's an entertaining movie with some fair-sized shortcomings.    First, let me address the people who compare this movie with the book.  As a history buff, I found the book terribly entertaining but terribly flawed (in fact, if you want to read my review of the book, look for the amazon.com review with that exact title).  I found at least twenty significant plot flaws in Crichton's book and I really have to wonder how the editors let it loose on the public without tying up many, many loose ends or logical inconsistencies.  Happily, the director Richard Donner and/or his screenwriters cleared some of those up, often by simply omitting them from the movie.    For instance, the protagonists in the movie have a reasonable number of moderately plausible escapes from danger, one of which involved Kate climbing out of a castle tower.  In contrast, in the book Crichton thought it would be clever to have our heroes make over a dozen utterly incredible, miraculous escapes, three or four of which feature Kate rescuing the others by virtue of her Spiderman-like climbing abilities.  Donner also rejected Crichton's ridiculous technological flaw in which he claimed that ITC's machine isn't actually a time machine, but instead sends people to alternate universes occurring at different points in time; if so, how could Professor Johnson, who visited a different, semi-parallel universe, have left his note and glasses 600 years ago in our universe?  The cinematic ITC does not mess with elaborate explanations, but simply states that they must be going through a \\"stable wormhole\\" into 1357 France.  Donner also sensibly axed Crichton's absurd \\"Green Knight of the Chapel of Death.\\"  Donner's Claire was a much more simple, believable character than Crichton's (i.e., she wasn't sleeping with or otherwise manipulating every non-peasant male in the story).  Who really cares if the character Chris is the professor's son in the movie, especially given that he does not act quite so foolishly as he did in the book.    Let's address the acting.  On a one-to-ten scale, the actors here range from about a four to perhaps a six.  It was no oversight that none of these performances received Oscar nominations, but they weren't horrendous, either.  Pretty much every performance was better than anything you've seen by Arnold Schwarzeneger, Adam Sandler or maybe even Kevin Costner.  Nothing memorable, but nothing so poorly done that it ruined the movie.    There are some problems with this movie.  First, Marek seems too attached to Lady Claire based on very little exposure to her.  It might have worked if there was another 20 minutes of interaction between them in the movie.  Next, I didn't think Lord Oliver was quite sinister enough.    There was also some ambiguity about time in this movie.  The spotlight reviewer claims the movie was set in the year 1971.  Although at the end, there is some mention about that year in reference to Marek's life, I think that may have been the year of his birth.  The movie is either set in approximately present day 21st century or has some big gaffs (I don't recall seeing any cell phones or four wheel drive Volvo sport utility wagons in 1971).    Overall, I thought the siege and battle were pretty well done, especially the trebuchets (medieval artillery, like a catapult), except for the archery aspect.  First, the castle defenders shoot fire arrows, for no discernable reason, then they switch to regular arrows, which the French call \\"night arrows\\" and decide to retreat because of them??!?  Doesn't make much sense.    Donner kept Crichton's subplot of Professor Johnson creating Greek fire, for no particularly good reason.  Just exactly how is it that an archeologist knows how to make an ancient chemical weapon that modern chemists can't duplicate?    I rather liked Crichton's end for Donniger better than the movie's, sending him back to a slightly different period of medieval France, exposing him to the plague, but that would not have worked in the movie's technological world.    In summary, this was a decent medieval action-adventure/sci-fi movie.  It has a very interesting basic plotline, with nothing either stellar or abominable.  It doesn't follow the book exactly, which actually is a benefit - this is one of the few movies that is better than the book upon which it is based.  Sit down with some popcorn, refrain from microanalysis and enjoy it.
B000002H97|5.0|I remember back in 1991, when I started getting into the heavier kinds of metal and it all started with this album. But before I ever got this album, I already heard of Metallica before. Many kids in my middle school were wering their shirts. Plus, I would see albums like Kill 'Em All advertized in Columbia House adds placed in magazines. At the time, I was just a conservative God believer with limited metal knowledge just avoiding anything satanic like any God believer would do. I was never a reckless, rebellious teenager but I was just a youngster who didn't know to much about life.  <br />Anyway, I heard of Metalllica before until I saw the original video for One on an MTV countdown in late summer of '91 but it wasn't until I saw Metallica on the 1991 MTV Music Awards preforming Enter Sandman. After that, I was hooked. Than, a friend from school let me barrow this album on cassette. When I took it home and listened to it, it was a divine moment that I would never forget. Every song on the album blew me away. So I bought the album the following year and the rest is history. <br />Now for my review. My opinion on this album hasn't changed since the first time I heard it and I don't think it ever will. Every single song still has the same appeal it had years ago. This is an album with plenty of heavy, brutal, thrashing, smashing, pulverizing riffs, fast, medium and slow parts and many magic moments. Some of the best song are Sad But True, Hollier Than Thou, Wherever I May Roam, Don't Tread On Me, Through The Never, Of Wolf And Man, The God That Failed and The Struggle Within. Buy this album and prepare for a rollercoaster ride. You'll love it.
0345298349|5.0|It was unfortunate I saw the Hollywood version of &quot;Gorky Park&quot;  before reading the novel.  The film does not do justice to the main character or the storyline.  It cannot compare to the book!  After reading &quot;Polar Star&quot; and Red Square&quot;, the second and third installments of the series, I picked up the original and loved it.  More recently, &quot;Havana Bay&quot; was published, and later this year a long-awaited fifth novel, &quot;Wolves Eat Dogs&quot;, will be released.  Arkady Renko, the protagonist of the series, is an honest, dedicated, hard-working Ukrainian cop.  When he was Chief Homicide Inspector for the Moscow Prosecutor's Office, he took charge of a grisly murder case involving the international fur trade.  Very quickly, he fell afoul of the KGB.  That's how his troubles began, which pursue him throughout all four novels.  I recommend this series highly.  The settings are supurbly drawn -- from snowbound Moscow to an Arctic Sea fish processing ship, from a steam-filled banya to the steamy port of Havana.  Wherever he goes, Arkady brings his cynical love-hate relationship with the Soviet system which often impedes his work.  Like Columbo, he outsmarts the sly evil-doers while seemingly fumbling his way along the investigation.  And he has more lives than the proverbial cat as his sleuthing lands him in the most lethal stews!  Author Martin Cruz Smith has created one of the most likable protagonists in police fiction.  Cleverly  writing the character as just &quot;Arkady&quot; --  intimately using his first name -- helps endear him to the reader.  We care for Arkady because of his moral strengths, his humility and compassion, and despite his weaknesses.  Along the way, Arkady has fallen obsessively in love with the most unsuitable woman imaginable: an obnoxious, abrasive dissident who not only treats him like dirt and breaks his heart, but is the cause of his political woes.  It is hard to lament in the least her later demise!  But wesympathize with our hero's suffering and rejoice in his small rewards.  Reward yourself by reading this exceptional series, beginning with &quot;Gorky Park&quot;!
B00003CY6M|5.0|If you love romantic comedies, you will love this.  In this movie, two people meet in a new york department store, have a wonderful time, and then leave it to fate to have them meet again.  A few years later, they are both about to get married to different people and go on last minute searches to find each other and get closure before tying the not.  They often cross paths and just barely miss each other, which can be pretty funny, and jonathan's (john cusac's) best man is hilarious.  A must see.

B00005JGAB|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing album.  Originally clocking in at under thirty minutes with fourteen tracks, it started an era that still holds true today.  &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; truely was the shot heard 'round the world.  And &quot;Beat On The Brat&quot;, their ode to rich mothers' children, keeps the album rocking all the way through.  &quot;Judy Is A Punk&quot; is based off of two Ramones fans, Jackie and Judy, who were always seeming to get into trouble. The Ramones would later do a less successful sequel to the song on the Phil Spector-produced &quot;End Of The Century&quot;.  Speaking of Spector, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot; sounds something right out of the early sixties.  It's excellent.  The entire album is fantastic, and defines true punk.  <br />Okay, to clear something up.  Some people are saying that the Ramones are more pop-punk, and that they did not actually start the era, but artists like The Stooges, New York Dolls, the Velvet Underground, T. Rex, and MC5 did.  This is both true and false.  Those five artists may have helped start an all-new sound, but the Ramones were more influenced by the likes of the Beach Boys and The Beatles than any of those three.  They wanted to play music that was unlike anything else at the time, becasue like many others they were dissatisfied with the current pompous and exaggerated music.  When this album was released in 1976, it sparked hundreds of other bands, calling themselves &quot;Punk&quot;.  The Ramones were the first band to truely be a punk-rock band.  Once that was established, The Stooges and those bands becames known as Pre-Punk.  <br />Buy this album.
B000000OUJ|5.0|The first time I heard this album was on some crappy old tape which I had borrowed from a friend of mine around early 96. I had the tape for about two months and I only ended up listening to it because I was extremely bored at the time. I don't know whether it was the unique production, The GZAs voice or his flow but I got hooked to this album. I was amazed at how some dirty, old tape could be so good to me. My friend never got it back for another five monthes. <br />This album had got some very unique production to it and displays that true Wu sound for anyone who's a fan. I believe this to be one of the best albums from the Wu camp and even if you aren't a fan one thing for sure is that this sound was and is different and The GZA's intelligent too.
B0001GF2DS|3.0|In the final shootout the score starts too early when Blondie drops the stone.So all the power in that shot is gone.In the short version(2h40min)the score starts half second or so later.<BR>Also the new dubbing sounds quite bad.Good movie but not so good release.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|There is music and then there is Music. The former is an assemblage of words and chromatic sounds that will entertain you. The latter is the expression of humanity. George Harrison is one of the rare people of his generation to have made Music. Wether you like(d) the Beatles or not, even if you didn't follow Harrison's &quot;life after the Beatles&quot;, absolutely buy this DVD. It is a grandiose homage to a beautiful human being, a clever, spiritual and sensitive man. I can never help but wonder at the richness of his lyrics, even when he let out his cleverly sarcastic sense of humor. His melodies, combined with his frail but expressive voice, always served the text perfectly (although sometimes the songs were overproduced). George Harrison, in spite of his fame and fortune, always remained the kind of person that we should all aim to become. The world would be a much better place...<BR>Oh yes, and &quot;god&quot; Brooker singing Old Brown Shoe brought a damn big smile to my face !!!
B000089CJI|5.0|What more can be said about the Postal Service's amazing CD &quot;Give Up&quot;?  Wonderful, dreamy, synth pop.  I don't know anybody who hasn't fallen in love with this CD!  Listen and be amazed!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is another great Tarantino.  A great revenge movie, Tarantino spends the first movie of two parts showing the blunt of the bloody revenge, leaving the story to be more developed in Kill Bill Vol 2. The acting is superb for an action movie, and although there is an excess of blood and gore, it is so much that it is almost laughable.  A definite for any Tarantino or action movie fan
B00003CXCT|5.0|I think the New Versions tell the story of Luke better than the orginal and even it does'nt who will not add this to their collection. Holla if you here me.
B00009W0U4|3.0|A movie is a vehicle by which it detaches the viewer from their real life and absorbs them into the fantasy life of the film. Fantasy and Detachement are the number one reasons why movies make so much money. Holloywood banks on those two things, sO much so that I believe that very few films are allowed to remind us of our realities. Disturbing and brutal films such as Irreversible do the opposite.  They suck you in only to slap you in the face with realty. Movie-goers are not used to this. I wasn't used to it either, but that's why I liked it. I realized that in my own mind I had glossed over violence and rape. Thinking it's always the nice and clean situations of \\"Law and Order\\" or CSI. This is not always true and this movie proves it. Did it have to be so brutal in it's depiction of those crimes? That's debatable. What's not debatable is it's affect. You are  in no way Detached from anything while watching this movie
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I watched this after the Oscars and I can see why Sofia won, however it's not my cup of tea.  Call me shallow, but I just didn't get it. Great soundtrack though! Debbie Farmer, parenting author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat'
B00005V1B1|5.0|Truly a Great progressive rock album.  Has tonal and mood swings. Beautiful lyrics coupled with great melody. Captures a very classic progressive sound of the period.  One of the greatest Groups on the face of the Earth.  Always a good fresh listen on any of their albums. Mirage, though has some of their most coveted songs!!!!  I play it every day and somehow feel a little closer to the heavens above.  This album is a monumental achievement. Definitely a must have. LONG LIVE CAMEL!!!!!
1592400876|4.0|I bought this book because of the catchy title.<br />I was surprised to find out that this book has great punctuation rules for the UK, but they are very different from what is considered correct USA punctuation.

B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Maroon 5 on the radio with Harder to Breathe. While I liked the song, I am hesitant to pick up cds of new artists for fear they are the next one-hit wonder. So, I forgot about it. Then, I saw a delightful movie called Love Actually and I picked up the soundtrack.  One of the tracks - a combined version of Sweetest Goodbye and Sunday Morning, put Maroon 5 back on my radar.  Several friends mentioned it was a great cd, and I was convinced I should pick it up.<br />Rarely do you come across a cd that is this good and all the tracks are well worth listening to.  SONGS ABOUT JANE is a fantastic collection that shares the story of a six month relationship the lead singer had with a woman named Jane.  Contained within the tracks is all of the anticipation, anxiety, love, betrayal, regret, excitement, loss and wonder.  While the relationship is no longer, Maroon 5 has compiled a cd that is totally accessible to the listener, one that each of us can find one if not more of the songs with which we can identify.<br />I am anxiously awaiting their next effort...
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Julia Roberts did a good acting job in this true-to-life film.<BR>I enjoyed it, even though the message seemed, at times, to be a bit heavy handed. I recommend it. Debbie Farmer parenting author,'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat'

DENZEL WASHINGTON WON A WELL-DESERVED BEST ACTOR OSCAR FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first saw Firefly, I wasn't sure I was going to like it. It was a Western ... set in space ... where people cursed in Chinese. By the end of that first episode, however, I was hooked. The dialogue was sharp and fresh (an overused description, but apt in this case), the characters were interesting, and it was, by turns, beautiful and funny and sad and true. What more can you ask of a show? Well, ratings, apparently -- but Firefly didn't get those only because it was A) put in the Friday night death slot, B) got no advertising support from FOX, and C) was preempted for weeks after the first two episodes (for baseball playoffs). You just can't do that to a fledgling show and expect it to get the ratings.<P> But Firefly isn't dead yet. Thanks to very outspoken fans and the relentless dedication of Joss Whedon (the show's creator), Firefly will take flight once again -- this time on the big screen, as the film &quot;Serenity.&quot; With any luck, the film will cause the show to be picked up again.<P>I can't honestly say this about any other show, but I really actually MISS Firefly, even though it's been off the air for months. Thanks to this DVD set, I can see and love these stories again, and wait for the day when &quot;Serenity&quot; hits theaters.
B0001US8EO|5.0|I absolutely love this film!<BR>It is the best Earp movie ever made.<BR>I like how they cover his whole life's story which is something I always wanted to see.<BR>Costner was fantastic as Wyatt. The rest of the cast was fantastic. A great job of casting parts!<BR>Quaid was unbelievable as Doc! Can you imagine what he went through to transform himself into this character? Nobody else has come remotely to Doc as Dennis has! Way to go, Dennis! You are one heck of an actor!<BR>The filming was great. Locations were beautiful.<BR>You couldn't ask for a better film on the subject!<BR>I am so happy to see this film finally coming to DVD!
B00005JMEW|1.0|I find it sad that this movie has received such accolades when it's nothing more than one gratuitiously violent scene after another. For example (spoiler alert), early on in the movie, Uma Thurman kills the mother of a four-year-old girl -- right in front of her. (And since when do four-year-olds ride the schoolbus? Get a clue, Quentin.) Later, during the anime sequence, a young girl hides under the bed while her mother and father are brutally, graphically slaughtered. Ha, ha... am I supposed to laugh now? Do yourself a favor and skip this disgusting, unfunny waste of celluloid and buy something that will make you feel good. Like, say, Chaplin's &quot;City Lights.&quot;
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|'Is this it' was no doubt a boldly phenomenal debut album, but the Strokes prove they're not a fluke with this follow-up that will blow you away on about the 3rd or 4th listen.  On the first couple listens you're thinking &quot;Yeah, this sounds about what I thought it would be...the Strokes...revisited.&quot;  Then you discover the details of each song and you suddenly realize how perfectly put together each instrument is, how refreshingly crafty each song is, how much you wish you had thought of the amazing guitar parts in the song &quot;Automatic Stop&quot;, and how their breakthrough style is something you're quite grateful for discovering.  I'm not going to compare them to anyone or say that they ripped of this person, etc., I'll just say that this is a fantastic album that you will love...forever.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I missed &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; when it was in the theaters (you have to move quickly up here in the Northland because we have only two movie theaters with a limited number of screens and films can disappear before you know it), but this turned out to be to my advantage.  Quentin Tarantino did not plan on &quot;Kill Bill&quot; being told in two &quot;volumes&quot; but Miramax decided that a four hour revenge film would be a bit much and consequently we end up with &quot;Volume 1&quot; coming out on DVD the same week &quot;Volume 2&quot; opens up in the theaters.  So having seen the Bride (Uma Thurman) take care of the first two names on her &quot;to do&quot; list I can treat tonight as an intermission and go see &quot;Volume 2&quot; tomorrow.  This is good because if I had to wait four months to see the second half of the film I would be pretty ticked off.<br />Once upon a time in El Paso, Texas a wedding party is slaughtered execution style.  However, it turns out that the Bride, who is pregnant, is not dead but in a coma.  Four years later she wakes up in time to save herself from insult being added to her ingury.  After dealing with a few annoying details, such as somebody trying to rape her comatose body and being unable to get her legs to move, the Bride puts together her list of people to kill: (1) Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), (2) O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), (3) Budd (Michael Madsen), (4) Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and (5) Bill (David Carradine).  There is more that happens in this film than eliminating the first two list (and since there is a Volume 2 telling you that the Bride survives Volume 1 does not constitute a spoiler), such as an anime telling us how O-Ren Ishii became the Queen of the Tokyo underworld.  But Tarrantino is all about how the Bride takes out her first two victims and the triumph of style as substance, especially when style means fountains of blood gushing from human beings that would make Akira Kurosawa proud.<br />You have to keep in mind that Tarantino has seen and committed to memory more movies than any other human being on the face of the planet.  The following is a list of movies and television series that are supposedly referenced in &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot;:<br />&quot;The Lodger,&quot; &quot;Scaramouche,&quot; &quot;The Wings of Eagles,&quot; &quot;The Magnificent Seven,&quot; &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; &quot;Tsubaki Sanjûrô,&quot; &quot;The Manchurian Candidate,&quot; &quot;Marnie,&quot; &quot;Honey West,&quot; &quot;Tôkyô nagaremono,&quot; &quot;I Lunghi giorni della vendetta,&quot; &quot;Da zui xia,&quot; &quot;Modesty Blaise,&quot; &quot;The Green Hornet,&quot; &quot;I Giorni dell'ira,&quot; &quot;Le Scandale,&quot; &quot;Ironside,&quot; &quot;Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro,&quot; &quot;Kurotokage,&quot; &quot;Da uomo a uom,&quot; &quot;La Mari&eacute;e &eacute;tait en noir,&quot; &quot;Twisted Nerve,&quot; &quot;C'era una volta il West,&quot; &quot;The Wild Bunch,&quot; &quot;Siu kuen wong,&quot; &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; &quot;Hannie Caulder,&quot; &quot;Black Mama, White Mama,&quot; &quot;The Last House on the Left,&quot; &quot;La Novia ensangrentada,&quot; &quot;Il Grande duello,&quot; &quot;Joshuu sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô, &quot;Shurayukihime,&quot; &quot;The Doll Squad,&quot; &quot;Tian xia di yi quan,&quot; &quot;High Plains Drifter,&quot; &quot;White Lightning,&quot; &quot;Shura-yuki-hime: Urami Renga,&quot; &quot;Truck Turner,&quot; &quot;Uomini duri,&quot;  &quot;Crash che botte!,&quot; &quot;Onna hissatsu ken,&quot; &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds,&quot; &quot;Thriller - en grym film,&quot; &quot;Du bi quan wang da po xue di zi,&quot; &quot;Profondo rosso,&quot; &quot;Switchblade Sisters,&quot; &quot;Black Sunday,&quot; &quot;Eaten Alive,&quot; &quot;7 note in nero,&quot; &quot;Hao xia,&quot; &quot;Yagyû ichizoku no inbô,&quot; &quot;Game of Death ,&quot; &quot;Grease,&quot; &quot;Wu du,&quot; &quot;Patrick,&quot; &quot;Day of the Woman,&quot; &quot;Hattori Hanzô: Kage no Gundan.&quot; &quot;Paura nella citt&agrave; dei morti viventi,&quot; &quot;Resurrection,&quot;  &quot;Shogun Assassin,&quot; &quot;Si wang ta,&quot; &quot;Makai tenshô,&quot; &quot;Escape from New York,&quot; &quot;Xian si jue,&quot; &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,&quot; &quot;Tenebre,&quot; &quot;The Professional: Golgo 13,&quot; &quot;Scarface,&quot; &quot;Gai shi ji hua,&quot; &quot;Year of the Dragon,&quot; &quot;Wong ga jin si,&quot; &quot;Hard to Kill,&quot; &quot;3-4x jugatsu,&quot; &quot;Miller's Crossing,&quot; &quot;Hong fen zhi zun,&quot; &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; &quot;Fong Shi Yu II: Wan fu mo di,&quot; &quot;Tai ji zhang san feng,&quot; &quot;True Romance,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; &quot;Jûbei ninpûchô,&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn,&quot; &quot;Full Tilt Boogie,&quot; &quot;Kite,&quot; &quot;Wei&szlig;kreuz,&quot; &quot;SF:Episode One,&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money,&quot; &quot;Proboscis,&quot; &quot;Wo hu cang long,&quot; &quot;Batoru rowaiaru,&quot; and &quot;Koroshiya 1.&quot;<br />I was happy I recognized over two dozen of the films on that list, and that is not even close to a passing score percentage-wise.  For all I know every single scene and shot in the film is lifted from something else, but the onslaught of references is apparently so relentless that everything old becomes new again, especially without a commentary track when QT can tell us the origin of each and every homage.  At this point what is most memorable to me is watching O-Ren Ishii and her posse walk glide into the House of Blue Leaves with the soundtrack giving them energy and the final showdown in an exquisite garden at night with gently falling snow where O-Ren in her white kimono and the Bride in her yellow biker suit do their dance of death with Japanese steel.<br />With &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; Tarantino made his impression upon our ears with scene after scene of great dialogue.  No wonder the soundtrack for that film had clips of some of what came rolling off the tongues of the actors (usually Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a corpse in this film).  But with &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; Tarantino's blood feast is mostly for the eyes.  Imagine what he can do if he every puts those two together in a single film.  Until then, we can see how the Bride deals with the rest of the people on her list.  This film is not for everybody, but then what Quentin Tarantino film ever was?.&quot; &quot;Paura nella città dei morti viventi,&quot; &quot;Resurrection,&quot;  &quot;Shogun Assassin,&quot; &quot;Si wang ta,&quot; &quot;Makai tenshô,&quot; &quot;Escape from New York,&quot; &quot;Xian si jue,&quot; &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,&quot; &quot;Tenebre,&quot; &quot;The Professional: Golgo 13,&quot; &quot;Scarface,&quot; &quot;Gai shi ji hua,&quot; &quot;Year of the Dragon,&quot; &quot;Wong ga jin si,&quot; &quot;Hard to Kill,&quot; &quot;3-4x jugatsu,&quot; &quot;Miller's Crossing,&quot; &quot;Hong fen zhi zun,&quot; &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; &quot;Fong Shi Yu II: Wan fu mo di,&quot; &quot;Tai ji zhang san feng,&quot; &quot;True Romance,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; &quot;Jûbei ninpûchô,&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn,&quot; &quot;Full Tilt Boogie,&quot; &quot;Kite,&quot; &quot;Weißkreuz,&quot; &quot;SF:Episode One,&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money,&quot; &quot;Proboscis,&quot; &quot;Wo hu cang long,&quot; &quot;Batoru rowaiaru,&quot; and &quot;Koroshiya 1.&quot;<br />I was happy I recognized over two dozen of the films on that list, and that is not even close to a passing score percentage-wise.

B00007ELJX|3.0|I hate to say it, but I was a bit disappointed with the movie simply because the movie was just too hard to follow. While watching the film I was thinking about Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; movie because like &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; made no sense to me whatsoever. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it had one of my favorite actresses in it (Patricia Arquette) with plenty of hot scenes with her. It also featured my favorite hard rock/metal band &quot;Rammstein&quot;. I'll have to say the movie lived up to its name for I was LOST throughout it.
B000002LQR|5.0|Funkadelic in your face jams that have and will stand the test of time. A Chili Peppers masterpiece from start to finish. I thought I lost this disc a while ago but due to a recent move it has resurfaced. One time through the player and I am hooked all over again. Early 90's feel like eons ago, heidi fliess in full swing and the Peppers were GODS on the west coast...  this is one of the best from the era, go ahead and due yourself a favor. Hypothical quesiton. If you only had 10 discs to take with you for the rest of your life this might just make my list....its a tough call. <br />Others to take a look at:<BR>Burning Spear- Far Over<BR>Kruder and Dorfmiester- K&amp;D Sessions<BR>Anything from &quot;Junkie XL&quot;<BR>Dub Tribe<BR>....
B00005T30L|4.0|I was totally not expecting to like this movie, the cover wasn't that creative, just two rather unattractive chicks. One of whom people seem to go ga-ga for, and she looks much better without the 20lbs she had to gain for this! I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing along with Seymour (played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi) and identifying (slightly) with Thora Birch's character, Enid. She's the kinda person you could be friends with; she's so fantastic with the dry humour! However, I'll always know Thora Birch as Teeny in Now &amp; Then, and she's still the same, just a little more grown up, but she still does the same facial expressions. At least she doesn't have to put Jell-O filled balloons in her bra anymore!<br />Steve Buscemi did his character, the overly eccentric and dorky Seymour, who Enid almost seems to grow an obsession with, which results in something which is quite embarrassing and cringe-worthy, especially the aftermath. You really do feel sorry for him, especially since he seems to be after Enid more than usual afterwards.<br />You get a whole background to Enid's character - her wimpy father, her dress sense, her bedroom, her taste in music/films. But what was really disappointing was the lack of background information about Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) character. She was basically a tag-along, and did all the following of the leader, Enid. Her character could have lots of development to it, but she was pushed aside to overly-extend Enid's character and home-life. Scarlett has definitely changed since Ghost World - she's gone platinum blonde since 'appearing' in films like Girl With A Pearl Earring and Lost In Translation. Rebecca seems to come and go in the film, she doesn't appear that much, and disappears for a lot of the film, along popping up now and then.<br />I really saw similarities between this and Romy &amp; Michele's High School Reunion. And any other high school movies along these lines.<br />At the start, I did not like Enid. She basically bossed Rebecca about, told her what to do and when and then she started on Seymour! Towards the end, I really began to feel for her, and felt a bit sad. This film said it was like no other &quot;teen comedy&quot; which seemed to imply it was a teen 'comedy'. Am I missing something, cos most of the film made me feel really sad, when it came to Enid &amp; Rebecca falling out, or the awkwardness with Enid &amp; Seymour. Sure, Seymour was funny, but with me identifying with Enid, I think you'll find this film a bit sad. If you identify with Rebecca, then you'll find it even sadder!<br />I'm so happy to have seen this movie, and it's a great addition to my collection, don't you think?! I'm still a bit freaked that I identified with Enid that much! But this is definitely a movie to get, although the whole Ghost World title doesn't have a lot to do with the movie (although a very cool and original title) - just don't think you're actually seeing a film about ghosts.like Enid. She basically bossed Rebecca about, told her what to do and when and then she started on Seymour! Towards the end, I really began to feel for her, and felt a bit sad.

0312263120|1.0|I would call this novel an interesting, easy read if not for its plot holes and many factual inaccuracies.<br />The main plot relies on the idea of an unbreakable code, the Digital Fortress.  Unfortunately the idea is nonsense -- their 'rotating cleartext' would ensure only that the message couldn't be read.  The government's supercomputer could break a code with a 256-character key in 12 minutes, but were able to break a code with a 1-million bit key after only 3 hours... Even if a supercomputer could break a code as complex as the first in 12 minutes, the second would take many lifetimes of the universe to crack.<br />Similarly, if the virus code had a 256-character key, no one trained in cryptology would allow the supercomputer to run for hours on end, since once it failed to recognize plaintext the first pass through, it would simply fail.<br />Despite the fact that the main characters were cryptologists working at the top secret NSA, typical cinematic-style passwords are used frequently - thee major codes are as short as 1-5 characters!<br />Let's not even get so far as to consider the implausibility of a virus in an encrypted message (since the data is treated as data, not an executable).  That's too much to expect of a novelist, right... even if the book is &quot;the most realistic techno-thriller&quot; as quoted on the back cover?
B00006RCNW|5.0|it is the best show on tv.
B00008973Q|1.0|I'll repeat the title of the review.  It's not the movie.  I think Kurosawa is just amazing, and I feel this film is fantastic.  I already owned the other DVD release of this film and I ordered this one because honestly, the picture quality of the other is harsh to watch.  And it's true this version is much cleaner, but they changed the aspect ratio.  Ran was shot originally in a 1:85:1 ratio.  For this new DVD they scanned it into the computer using an HD system, and chopped the frame from 1:85:1 to 16:9.  It's hard to really compare the two ratios, but being a film geek when I started the film immediately I knew something was wrong when the image was bigger and the end of Kurosawa's name was chopped off.  I pulled out my old version of Ran, and threw it on my computer and played the opening titles side by side.  Sure enough, the edges of the film have been chopped off.  Now, this won't bother most people.  But for a film student like myself, it bothers me to see people mess with someone else's art in this manner.  It's worse than Lucas butchering Star Wars or Spielberg and ET (albeit not by much) because it isn't even their film!  Other films have been cleaned up and placed on to DVD without distorting the image, many Kurosawa films in fact.  It bothered me to see it, and I was pretty let down, this is just a fair warning to anyone else like me.
B000002UAX|5.0|it's simple. The White Album has got to be the greatest album ever. <br />It has everything you are looking for. Some songs being more folk music, some more punk (Helter Skelter). If a teacher taught the development of different types of music, he would just need to play this album. Helter Skelter is an great example of The Beatles' punk rock side. It shows how The Beatles were the fathers of punk. Most of their songs show that they greatly contributed to classic and hard rock. Country was influenced. THIS ALBUM IS THE GREATEST.<BR>It is near perfect. The only problem is too much Yoko Ono (evil woman who broke up The Beatles) with a few lyrics in &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill.&quot; <BR>eh, with every song on this album being GREAT, including that. I think that it is okay.<BR>Thanks for Reading.
B0001Z363W|5.0|This is a totally awesome album.  The musicianship is supreme and so is the songwritting. It's the heaviest acoustic stuff I've ever heard!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm not particularly into this genre, but after hearing about 5 songs that got radio play (that I liked prior to finding out who the performer was), I decided to break down and buy the CD.  I am so glad I did!  The entire CD is excellent.  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXXS|4.0|This is a great movie, it is full of action, and the dinasaurs are very realistic. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because I gave Jurassic Park #1 5 stars, and no movie is better than Jurassic Park #1.
B0001ENYKS|2.0|Like the Broken Social Scene, I've given this album repeated plays only because it gets such stellar reviews from people I trust. That being said, I can't get past the fact that this album has maybe 2-3 decent songs, plenty of filler, and a few tracks that are downright unlistenable.
B000002UJQ|2.0|The singer spends most of the album imitating Unforgettable Fire-era Bono, slurs his words in an effect that can only be called pretentious (or lacking in anything to say). The band really is quite good. But overall, the melodicism is soupy, the effect unfocused. The standout here is &quot;Karma Police.&quot; But all in all, a hideously overrated album. As with Averil Lavigne, I'm sure kids think this is terrific. They'll know better in a few years.
1592400876|4.0|I'm sorry you didn't care for this book. I thought it was fantastic, and brought to light many of the same grammatical foibles that bother me. I don't consider myself \\"pointed-headed and grammar-obsessed,\\" although I am very careful with language and punctuation.  While I agree with you that \\"it's better to have something to say and say it with skill and grace,\\" this applies only to the spoken word. It is difficult to write anything skillfully or gracefully when you lack basic punctuation. And while I also agree that \\"Our language evolves,\\" to cling to the niceties of grammar and punctuation is to embrace the bigger picture, not to miss it. As our language evolves so quickly, it is vital to retain elements of standard punctuation so that meanings are not misconstrued. To punctuate correctly is to ensure that your message will be read clearly and understood as you intended.
B00016POFE|5.0|This is the first DVD-A release that I've purchased and I must say it is quite an impressive item.  IN ABSENTIA is an excellent recording by an equally excellent band.  The DVD-A version is a must have even if you already own the CD version.  The sound quality (even with the crisp sound on the CD) is better and it's a wonder to behold in 5.1.  The DVD cut also contains three bonus tracks; DROWN WITH ME- an obvious IN ABSENTIA cut out that has some great harmonies, CHLOROFORM- which harkens older, SIGNIFY era Ptree, and a kick ass rocker- FUTILE- which is one of the band's hardest tracks ever and is absolutely cool.  Included as well are three videos; BLACKEST EYES- with some live band footage teamed with disturbing imagery, STRIP THE SOUL- which is chock full of unsettling visions, and WEDDING NAILS- which is mostly dark, slow moving images.  The extras make for a nice reason to buy this DVD if you already own the CD, and the quality is unmatched.  The next major release I purchase will make for a hard choice between the two formats, and I might end up with both.  If you're not a fan of PORCUPINE TREE this is a cool item to start with and if you ARE a fan already you SHOULD have this already.
B0001FGBL6|3.0|In case you're wondering, I do NOT have a predisposition to dislike artists from the Netherlands.  It's just that I haven't been impressed by any of these &quot;marvelous, unbeatable&quot; bands like Within Temptation (sorry, but I don't understand why people say they have a good singer - and this is coming from a trained vocalist) and After Forever.  But I'm always open to something new, so I tried out Epica.  Like After Forever, Mark J. tries too hard to be 'unique,' only to shroud himself in a gown of cliches so thick you could asphyxiate a hippo with it.  Come on, choirs and orchestras?  Sure, six years ago, when the first Tristania albums came out, choirs in metal were a novelty (and performed in a way so that they stood out).  Orchestras were great when Winds and Penumbra were doing them, or when the symphonic black metal movement was in its nativity.  But now, EVERYONE and their mother is recruiting an orchestra and a choir to help their band.  Now, this is fine, it's just that in most cases, such as this one, YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM!  And when you can, you can't distinguish the orchestra from the synthesizer, and the choir just sounds like the female singer doing voice-overs.  Like After Forever, they need to make much more use of the male vocalist (who if I'm not mistaken is the infamous Mr. Jansen), because he has a very effective and well-developed growl.  Now, the female singer:  Not as good as Floor from After Forever, but FAR better than that whiner in Within Temptation.  She sounds like she's struggling at times, but doesn't get off-key.  But the thing that really makes this band better than the two aforementioned artists is that their guitars actually sound like guitars!  With WT and on After Forever's Decipher (the only one of their albums I have so far), the guitars get drowned out by the keyboards, giving them a very transparent and toned-down sound.  Epica's got the keyboards and guitars at perfect volumes, so that each instrument seems to complementthe other.<br />So in the end... if you're one of those who loves After Forever, then I'm pretty sure you'll like Epica too.  They are certainly a good band, especially if you don't pay any attention to the oh-so-original (I've never been more sarcastic in my life) lyrics and concepts.  So, check these guys (and gal) out; you might be surprised.
B00005JMEW|5.0|For the past decade, American cinema has produced the worst there was to be made in terms of filmmaking, as well as the best. In the Hollywood brain-washing jungle universe, Tarantino belongs to an endangered species : the brilliant director. For most of the Hollywood-addicted zombies, or &quot;average movie-goers&quot; as officially stated, Tarantino's &quot;oeuvre&quot; doesn't stand much of a true appreciation chance. It is like hoping for an illiterate to appreciate Shakespeare,Proust,Dostoïevski.Thus, unsurprisingly , &quot;Kill Bill&quot; wasn't a thrill in the ranks of those who still mistake John Ford with Henry Ford, don't have a clue about The New Wave in Europe, John Woo's Honk-Kong period,Japanese animation or Sergio Leone's westerns. How could they not find &quot;Kill&quot; &quot;boring&quot; as I happened to read? Tarantino is everything American cinema was at its best and everything it should be, yet it is outstanding to witness the foreign trend of his work, the broad references which appeared to elude so many.<br />Eventually, for every person with a functionning brain and intending to keep it that way, buy &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, the rest, as Bono sings &quot;will pass&quot;.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I can't tell if this is a sucker ploy or not.  Will they finally release the editions that I and many others want after sales of the \\"special\\" edition begin to slump?  That shows how bad things are getting.  They will do anything to get you to buy the same thing three and four times over.<br />I'm holding out for the original editions.  If they never come, oh well more money for better things.<br />P.S. Don't be at all surprised if next year they come out with a 6 DVD box set that will end up being the only way to buy \\"episode 6\\" (or the original versions).
B00003CWL6|5.0|The movie reminds me of a painting.  Every touch of paint is put on very carefully.  The result is a masterpiece.  This movie also reminds me of the 1950's classic, Sunset Boulevard.  Spacey's character is much like William Holden's character.  Both want to be better than their current state of affairs.  Kevin Spacey gives one of the best performances of the decade.  Sam Mendes' first movie is his finest.  He would be hard pressed to make another as great.
0553260111|4.0|Jason Bourne is a man with extraordinary skills. He has an altered appearance, access to millions of dollars and can get more using his many talents. The problem is that he does not know who he is, how or why he has acquired his skills and where he comes from. He is a man with no memory.<br />Stranded in Southern France and nurtured back to health by a drunkard doctor, Bourne is desperate to regain his past, future and identity. How can he do it though if he does not know where to start and what to look for? Moreover, there are individuals out there gunning for his life. A Canadian woman is helping, but will that be enough to remain alive when international assassin Carlos will do anything to end his life?<br />The thriller moves fast and weaves into and out of different cities and personalities. Twists abound and Bourne has to move fast or risk staring into the eys of death. The book is an action-packed and fast-paced tale of espionage and international deception, with many incredible and often far-fetched coincidences and breaks, but for sheer heart-pumping action The Bourne Identity moves as fast as a bullet to the heart.
B0000931OG|4.0|Like a lot of others, I didn't really like this when I first heard it but grew on me slowly until I loved it! I knew it wasn't going to be like Parklife, but this is nearly as brilliant and very different. For me, Caravan, Out of Time and On the Way to the Club are the highlights. But I think you have to listen to the whole album to get the most out of it.
B000002LRX|5.0|I listened to this album in the Navy and while it was playing I ended up not knowing where I was and didn't want to find out.  The music has an almost narcotic effect on you and you can't get popped on a drug test for it.  Its insanely addictive and the more you hear it the more you want to listen.  Just like a drug now isn't it :)<br />L8r
B000002UTT|5.0|I have to Say that this Cd holds alot of special memories for me when I younger and first owning the Cassette I received as a gift it got played over and over again, now I have the Cd and it is played quite a bit as I find that not only do I find it nostalgic it's also one of those Cd's that you can never tire of.My favourite songs on this have to be &quot;Paint(I can liten to that one over and over), Dance Away, Listen to your heart and Cry.<BR>This Cd takes me back to my Teen years with my bestest friend Sarah.Greatest times.:-)
0345452577|1.0|Kellerman has lost it!  Years ago, when I first discovered his books, I could not put them down.  Now I read them through our local book club as punishment. He has become blas&eacute;, predictable, self-involved and should be put out to pasture.  I sometimes wonder if he has a secretary who fills in the gaps once he has decided on the storyline.  Never again, not even for our book club.
B00004T9UF|5.0|i jerked myself all day once when i was listening to eminem, it was like non stop jerking time,  then i went to my neighbor and i chased the man with a siccor for half an hour than i took my video camera to tape myself (...)after that i shot that silly old man in the head and cut his his wife in pieces than when i got back home i listened to the second half of the album. So you know it's wicked!!! Buy this album cause there are nice beats, rhymz and flows on it.
038572179X|3.0|The writing is luminous, no question about that.  But the plotline is most troubling.  A promising young man  - who has recently graduated with first-class honors from Cambridge - of humble origin is sent to prison on the unsupported and false testimony of a hyperimaginative 13 year old girl?  McEwan doesn't even allude to the trial, which could have been a fabulous opening for some real drama.  And Cecelia, the thwarted older sister who suspects the truth, stands mutely by and allows this to happen to her lover, after her own privacy has been monstrously violated and she has been grievously wronged?  Instead of dragging Briony into an empty room and slapping the truth out of her?  And what kind of ludicrous police investigation would allow such an injustice?  Didn't the accused have a solicitor at trial?  Is this merely class bigotry writ large?  Not in 1935.  All of these issues are problematic.  The middle section of the book, concerning the BEF evacuation at Dunkirk, is much too long and overdone, a digression from the central theme.  And the conclusion is intellectually dishonest and unsatisfying after such a build-up.  In the end, there's no atonement at all, which makes the title a misnomer.
B00009W0U4|1.0|First of all, the cameraman needs to learn to hold the camera steady in his hands. Be prepared for 95 minuts of shaky, unstable, jerky camera movements on your screen. After the first five minutes I got seasick. Also the movie is shot in dark colors, and usually you have hard times seeing the details, and only observe moving silhouettes (in addition to the graininess and annoying jerky camera movements). The first murder scene in the basement of a sleazy gay club is not worth watching at all, as it tells nothing, signifies nothing, and from the cinematographic viewpoint made especially badly and unconvincing. The rape scene is also very unnatural and laughable, making me think that the movie had no director whatsoever. All in all the movie is a big waste of time - the storyline is one-dimensional and boring, the acting is poor, the directing is virtually non-existent, and the camerawork is the worst in years. I don't know why all those critics were raving about the flick, but even the mediocre Kill Bill would be much better worth of your time and money.
0739432176|5.0|This is an adventure that will keep you on your toes. You never know what will happen. Garth Nix develops the characters in detail and describes so well that you can almost feel what the characters are going through. It is a well balanced series that contains just the right amount of adventure, magic, and suspense.
B00008AWOG|5.0|The compositions show the progressive influence that's so affluent within their artistic trajectory. The ambiance pervading this album is that of somber melancholy. A lugubrious tale about a man being exiled from a town and his beloved Melinda only return to her and find out her promise is made to another, though I won't reveal the ending. TAKE NOTE: If you listen closely to &quot;The Moor,&quot; about 9 or 10 minutes into the song, when it quiets you can hear a sigh. Now this sigh was not Mikael or any of the other members. They recorded the vocals for that song at night while not a body was around outside the studio. Very mysterious indeed. Anyway, each track is a masterpiece and &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; is their best all-clean vocal track. P.S. I saw them play &quot;The Moor&quot; live at Graceland in Seattle, it was there first time performing that song live and it just happened to be my favorite song of theirs, emotionally powerful live band. In addition, good lyrics accompany their majestic music and they're music lovers, not just metal heads. Down-to-earth lads. I highly recommend this album to real music lovers not just metal heads. My personal favorite Opeth record to date.
B0000C8AUO|5.0|Wow! One word for this album...amazing. David Bowie has certainly made it clear that he is alive and kicking...and has no intentions of retiring any time soon. &quot;The Lonliest Guy&quot; is a moving vision, while &quot;Never Get Old&quot; definately reflects Bowie's career and the views of his fans. This album certainly shows glimpses of his 70s sound, but he has made it feel very modern too. He is an incredible performer (check out the Reality Tour), and an artist who will live forever in the heart's of his fans. We know he'll never get old!!
1400031362|5.0|This writer has me hooked on this series!  I know that anyone who enjoys this type of reading material will no doubt enjoy this book and this series!
B0000844MS|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies. It's one of those rare films that stayed fresh until I saw again last year. I wasn't disappointed with it at all. Sometimes with movies you h ave false memories of how the story went.<BR>I didn't have a problem like that with this movie at all. Even though there are not many characters in this film ( it mostly revolves around Sarah and King Jareth. ) It is a lot of fun to watch.<BR>It's a great way to get kids interested in fantasy and some what of a family movie as well.
0743243307|3.0|I bought Brick Lane\\" because of all the publicity surrounding the author Monica Ali and her debut novel: \\"A magnificent coup\\" according to the Observer\\", with a \\"comic touch\\" according to the \\"Guardian\\". Neither did I find \\"Brick Lane\\" magnificient, nor a coup. Hints of a comic touch may have been there, but I must have missed missed them.<br />Don't get me wrong, at times I did enjoy reading \\"Brick Lane\\", but it was not a book that I did not want to put down until I had finished reading the last page. It started out good, but weakened by the page. <br />\\"Brick Lane\\" is basically the story about Nazneen's and Chanu's marriage, their life in Tower Hamlets in London and that of a woman who was left to her fate until she took fate in her own hands. Throughout Nazneen's stay at Tower Hamlets she receives letters from her sister Hazima, who ran away from home for a love marriage (whereas Nazneen submitted to her father in marrying Chanu). Hasina's letters are not only updates of life in Bangladesh but also mirror Nazneen's life in London.<br />Some of the characters are indeed very well developed, but mostly I found the read tedious and somewhat lengthy. 200 pages less would have sufficed and a tad more spark would have been good!<br />Result: Don't set your hopes to high on this one or you might be as disappointed as I am!
0345452577|3.0|I generally don't like it when my authors go off on tangents and write something else other than what they got me hooked with. I loved the first Alex Delaware novel and became an avid reader of all his adventures.<br />I was mildly disappointed to find that The Conspiracy Club wasn't a Delaware novel, but when I discovered that the protagonist was a psychologist, I decided it might not be too bad.<br />It wasn't too bad. It took me longer to become engaged in Carrier's adventures than it does with Delaware. I also found the plot development to be somewhat ponderous. The book moved turgidly in the beginning and the premise seemed just a little bizarre. Of course it all became clear at the end, which I suppose is what an author shoots for, but it doesn't make for a really gripping book.
B000002KE2|5.0|Black Sabbath was on top of the world by 1972. Always dismissed by rock critics, they made fans in legions. Their 1970 debut album, BLACK SABBATH, broke all the rules about how to win popularity and shot to #23 on the U.S. Billboard album chart. Their same-year sophomore record, the gloomy, eerie PARANOID, broke the coveted Top Ten and landed at #8. Their third album, the gloomier MASTER OF REALITY, jetted past both records to the #4 spot. The once-dirt-poor band was now being driven around in limos, touring as the headliner and playing in 20,000-seat arenas. They ranged in age from 22 to 23 years old.<br />Despite their sudden fame, Black Sabbath played to the fans. They always did. In 1972 they took a couple of months to record their fourth album, simply titled VOL. 4. This was in stark contrast to their previous works which were recorded in a matter of days. The front cover, showing an infrared Ozzy giving the fans his trademark double-peace-sign while singing, says it all: this was a fan's album. Black Sabbath was not going to disappoint. Sure enough, they didn't. <br />If anything, Black Sabbath branched out on this record. Though the sound on most of the ten songs on VOL. 4 was still decidedly raw and powerful, there were clear signs of maturation. One of the most obvious examples was on the first song, the eight-minute epic medley &quot;Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener&quot; which opens with a muscular riff and then goes through movements and time-changes, just like a classical piece. It is not an instrumental, however, as Ozzy sings---very well, I might add---on a good portion of it. Another prime example of the band's maturation of sound is the piano-driven, Mellotron-infused ballad &quot;Changes,&quot; which apparently a lot of people have recently discovered for the first time. As the songs lyrics go, &quot;I feel unhappy, I feel so sad/I lost the best friend that I ever had.&quot; Ahhhh...you can just feel the heartbreak! Still another excellent example is the incredible, lilting, absolutely beautiful 2:50 instrumental &quot;Laguna Sunrise,&quot; which is by far, hands-down, the best song to play for anyone who thinks that Black Sabbath equals noise. The song is so gorgeous in its imagery that it's indescribable to this day!<br />I'm not going to go through each and every song on VOL. 4, but let me just point out the best ones that I haven't yet mentioned: &quot;Supernaut,&quot; with one of the most recognizable introductory riffs of any Black Sabbath song, is among the most respected; it has been covered several times over the years, most notably and recently by the Industrial/Grindcore band Ministry. Funky for a Black Sabbath song, you can just picture the band performing it on an early-'70's TV show, with infrared photography &amp; all! (Ah, the good old days of rock music!) Of course, another one of the Sabs' most famous and respected tunes is the anti-drug epic &quot;Snowblind.&quot; With its multi-part structure and sudden time-changes, it remains among their most compelling and best-loved tracks to this day. The last song, the medley &quot;Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes&quot; is fiercely individualistic, another Ozzy lyrical trademark.<br />As with its predecessor MASTER OF REALITY, this album's sound is uneven. Sometimes it's clear as a bell (&quot;Laguna Sunrose&quot;), other times a bit crackly (&quot;Changes&quot;) and still other times flat and muffled (&quot;Supernaut&quot;). However, it's still among the very best Black Sabbath albums ever. It makes me wonder, as Ozzy was raising his hands in his famous double-peace-sign-salute, did he have any idea that the Vietnam War was going to end in the following year?<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B00008OLYN|5.0|This CD embarks on new eras and times that no band could ever touch upon save Opeth. The timeless meloncholy and ethereal interludes leaves you caught up in a flurry of a modern sonata of musical brilliance and epic melodies. This really defines the art of music and bringing emotion into melodies.
B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath's third album MASTER OF REALITY was recorded within a few days in 1971 and released the same year. Comparing it with their first two albums, BLACK SABBATH and PARANOID (both 1970), I'll say it like this: The former album was The World's Introduction To The Band Formerly Known As Earth and was basically a series of extended blues jams (with the exception being the foreboding title song), while the latter was Black Sabbath Showing The World Their Full Range and was an affirmation of their new-found style in showing the range of their creepiness, ranging from hard and fast (Paranoid, Electric Funeral) to soft and slow (Planet Caravan). MASTER OF REALITY, however, is pure gloom and doom. To put it metaphorically, BLACK SABBATH was the initial tremor, PARANOID was the earthquake; MASTER OF REALITY was the dense aftershock.<br />The rather plain cover basically says it all: the music is black, very black, with shades of dark purple and gray. Considering all that was going on in the world at the time, this music was apt: The Vietnam War was still going on and, at that time, had no end anywhere in sight. People were being beaten senseless and, in the case of Kent State University in Ohio that year, even killed---just for protesting against this inhumane and immoral war. Race riots were the norm. Peace seemed like a toddler's fantasy. Nixon was President. This was the context of the times in which Black Sabbath recorded &amp; released this, their third album.<br />Sporting the deepest, darkest riffs this side of a dead plane engine, MASTER OF REALITY opens with the infamous ode to marijuana, &quot;Sweet Leaf,&quot; goes right into the argument for life after death (and God), &quot;After Forever.&quot; By the way, anyone who still wants to argue---incorrectly---that Black Sabbath were into Satan needs to be shown the lyrics to this song, which says plaintively, &quot;Perhaps you think before you say God is dead and gone/Open your eyes, just realize that he is the one, The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate.&quot; <br />Anyway, the band then segues into a very short and odd-sounding instrumental &quot;Embryo,&quot; then goes right into the dark, fast plea for peace, &quot;Children Of The Grave.&quot; Again for the doubters, this song says, &quot;So you children of the world listen to what I say/If you want a better place to live in spread the word today.&quot;  The next song is a beautiful, one-and-a-half-minute instrumental breather, &quot;Orchid,&quot; which shows that guitarist Tony Iommi knows how to do a lot more than just crunch electrical chords. Then comes the deep crunch of &quot;Lord Of This World,&quot; which addresses the ways of evil by saying, &quot;Your world was made for you by someone above/But you chose evil ways instead of love.&quot; <br />Next comes one of the most beautiful, depressing songs ever, the extremely moody, dark, soft and acoustic rejection ballad &quot;Solitude.&quot; Despite what some people think, this song is actually sung by Ozzy Osbourne, NOT drummer Bill Ward. (Many people don't realize that Ozzy can display vastly different intonations with his voice; it's just that he doesn't usually do this. Bill Ward has in fact, sung lead on only two Black Sabbath songs ever: &quot;It's Alright&quot; from the 1976 clunker TECHNICAL ECSTASY and &quot;Swinging The Chain&quot; from the 1978 Ozzy Osbourne swansong NEVER SAY DIE!) &quot;Solitude&quot; is extremely sobering, even numbing, and is an excellent song to play for people who think that Black Sabbath is all about noise. Beginning with the lyric, &quot;My name it means nothing/My fortune is less,&quot; &quot;Solitude&quot; is poetic and heartbreaking. Then, just in case we forgot that we are, in fact, listening to a Black Sabbath record, the final track &quot;Into The Void&quot; comes roaring at us with some majorly deep, fast, heavy riffage from Tony Iommi while Ozzy sings about the hypocrisy of NASA and the Space Program, &quot;Rocket engines burning fuel so fast/Up into the night sky they blast/Through the universe the engines whine/Could it be the end of man and time?&quot; <br />With lyrics so poignant, with songs so powerful, is it any wonder that this album was more popular than either one of their first two albums? (Look it up: BLACK SABBATH got as high as #23 on Billboard, PARANOID hit #8 and MASTER OF REALITY went up to #4.) Is it any wonder that Black Sabbath, on their 1998-99 Reunion Tour, played almost every single song from MASTER OF REALITY? Sure, this album is only about 34 minutes long (making it the shortest Black Sabbath album ever); however, it is the quality of the songs that matter. MASTER OF REALITY has quality coming out in spades.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Illmatic is in my opinion, the best hip hop cd ever created.  Nas blesses us with some of rap's tightest lyrics, strung togther with simple, effective beats.  The anniversary edition offers us a few remixes, decent at best, just nice to have some new Nas material for any fanatics.  However, the full original recording is here, which if you have not heard is a MUST HAVE for anyone who is a fan of hip-hop music. Cop it.
B000001ESP|5.0|CAMERA EYE, the 10 minute opus in the middle of the album, alone is worth the price of admission!  This album is absolutely fabulous.  Not only do you get CAMERA EYE...but you get TOM SAWYER and YYZ too...it's just a classic album that no good rock music collection can live without.
B00018D44U|5.0|The first thing I noticed about this album is the greater emphasis Norah puts on her Texan roots. There is definitely more of a Texas-fried feeling to the music.  What I mean by that is the greater use of the acoustic guitar and the percussion--also, the twangier qualities in her voice.  The album starts off with a beautiful, warm and introspective song (SUNRISE), and moves on smoothly to other tracks, revealing the many facets of Norah's versatility as an artist.  Whether she is doing a cover of Tom Waits' song, LONG WAY HOME, or adding her own words to Duke Ellington's MELANCHOLIA, recorded here as DON'T MISS YOU AT ALL, Norah maintains her classiness and sweet sound, and we also see that her Southern upbringing has instilled in her a real feeling for the music she sings.  Though some people really didn't like her duet with Dolly Parton, CREEPIN' IN, I thought it really showed off her vocals in a great way.  I could she and Dolly were having a good time.  Though, stylistically, they are quite different (Dolly is more bouncy, while Norah remains low key), it was a lot of fun to hear!<br />Please give this album a chance.  Many of the reviews I have seen have been lackluster, but, this Norah fan gives it a true vote of confidence!
B000002IOW|5.0|This album was my first taste of the band RUSH.  I discovered this wonderful disc in 1991...and haven't looked back since.  I now own all 30 years' worth of music from this great band....and always look forward to their next release.  This album is just....great.  There is no other word to describe it.  All of the songs just mesh together so well...and the subject matter is great when you want to get away from blah love songs on the radio.  AVAILABLE LIGHT AND SUPERCONDUCTOR are the highlights of this gem....which every avid music fan should own!  Anybody who can make a song centering around the production of sound and tv (AVAILABLE LIGHT) has to be good!  The only let down was that RUSH dropped Rupert Hine as a producer after ROLL THE BONES.  I wish they would get him back....  Other than that, enjoy this!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I had to add my two cents about this album. I have never heard such a beautiful, brilliantly arranged CD before!  From DON'T KNOW WHY, the song that probably everyone has heard, to THE NEARNESS OF YOU, Norah shows off her talent as a jazz chanteuse, blues crooner and sensitive pianist.  Listening to her music is like listening to the beat of my own heart.  There is something so earthy and clear about her sound.  Norah paints a picture with her voice.  Other songs I highly reccomend on this album are FEELING THE SAME WAY ALL OVER AGAIN, SEVEN YEARS, THE PAINTER SONG, I'VE GOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, and every other cut on the album.  Norah is a treasure.  The critics and the deejays were not exaggerating about this fine debut work.  We have her mother, Sue Jones, to thank, for her continued inspiration of Norah.  I am sure Ravi Shanker, her father, must be proud as well!
B00003CXCT|2.0|While I agree that having this trilogy on DVD finally with all of the new features (not new effects) and extras is probably a good move for star wars fans, I can't say I am excited about the release the way I wanted to be.  Episodes I and II were a huge disappointment and further brought to light how Lucas ruined the original 3 with the re-release.  It is worth it for anyone to get a good laserdisk copy of the original movies and get someone that loves them to sample it down to DVD format.  Laserdisk was great quality and with the affordable HD video editing software out there today, a good DVD of the orignal 3 can be made.  There are probably even people selling the orignal releases somewhere out there.<br />I am not a fanatic at all. Lucas really did ruin his creation and reputation.  Not quite as bad as Michael Jackson, but close.  I am a real-world casual movie lover and this is just bad.

0375703861|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book for its sometimes hilarious insight into a culture that seemed less familiar the more the story progressed. The characters are well drawn and engaging. Highly recommended both as an entertaining read and &quot;real literature.&quot;

0385510438|4.0|While the on-the-surface synopsis of The Last Juror may indicate it to be just another in a long line of murder mystery and courtroom thriller, it is anything but.  And...this is a good thing.  While certain elements of the novel tend to be formulaic, there exists, however, a refreshing vibrancy that emanates from the wistful idealism of our hero protagonist Willie Traynor and his anything but unlikable friend and confidant Miss Callie.  For Grisham fans, it is a return to the idyllic fictional Mississippi town of Clanton in Ford County set in the 1970s -- last visited in A Time To Kill.  Also reprising their roles are the enigmatic divorce lawyer Harry Rex and the slimy and slippery Lucien Wilbanks.<br />What makes this book unique and refreshing is that it is not a mere &quot;legal thriller&quot; recounting a courtroom drama ad nauseam.  Told from a callow journalist's point of view, it serves to break the mold of sorts.  We are taken along for the bumpy, yet highly enjoyable ride as Willie Traynor opines with admirable conviction in his editorials for his newly acquired Clanton Times on topics ranging from Vietnam, Bargain Center, the Padgitt trial, etc.<br />Traynor's idealism and courage of conviction are contagious and make the book worth reading alone.  Grisham's well-placed humor, able characterization, &amp; seemingly effortless insertion of multidimensional supporting characters such as Sam, Lucien, Margaret, &amp; Baggy also add to the story immensely.  Good stuff.
B00008DDSC|3.0|It's VERY refeshing to see an unconventional love story like this one.  I have gotten fed up watching offerings such as Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, Maid in Manhattan.  Yes, they are feel-good movies but sometimes, I do wondered if those movie moguls are insulting our intelligence.  This movie illustrated to us that love could &amp; would happen to anyone of us, &amp; love needn't be fallen to us in a conventional way by any means.  What is love, we might say.  It's naughty, surprising, tantalising &amp; humorous in a dark way.  There isn't much addition in the DVD other than the commentary.  For those of you that yearn to watch something out of ordinary, please give this movie a go.  You would be pleasantly surprised!  Recommended.
B0001AP12G|5.0|It's hard to explain this album, which is destined to be a classic, mainly because it is a fresh sound that I don't think I've ever heard. It's not gangster or thug rap. It's not abstract. It's not comical. I'd describe it as poetic. Kanye keeps it interesting throughout the entire album (which is very difficult to do in 20 tracks). His subject content is great and varied throughout the entire album (not to mention the amazing production, which is not surprising). We all know Kanye can produce a beat. He is not on the same level, nor does he have the same seniority as classic producers like DJ Premier or Pete Rock, BUT he is one step below them and will continue to be. But the fact alone that Kanye can rap AS WELL AS produce is amazing. He has stories to tell in popular tracks like &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, &quot;Through the Wire&quot; (great song) and &quot;Spaceship&quot;. &quot;We Don't Care&quot; is another catchy track with a great beat and meaningful lyrics. I think it's neat that he devoted a song to Jesus in &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;. You don't hear that much about God anymore. Kanye shows his faith in God in the deep track Jesus Walks. Flip it around and you've got a few fun tracks like &quot;School Spirit&quot; and &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;. I especially like the hook from School Spirit, which is a little comical when makes fun of the frat names. Switch it up again and you have a little bit of raw production with &quot;Get 'Em High&quot; with a featured appearance from Talib Kweli. More clever lyrics from Kanye in that song. &quot;Two Words&quot; is another great song with appearances from Mos Def and Freeway. The production captured me more in that song than the lyrics. &quot;Family Business&quot; is another one of his personal tracks where he talks about, yup you guessed it, his family business. And last, but not least, my favorite song on the album, &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; was a deep captivating track with an unforgettable appearance from Jay-Z. Kanye, Jay-Z, and another rapper (I have yet to figure out his name) drop amazing deep verses about various subjects such as philosophy, Jay talks about his past in the rap game, and Kanye runs down a little bit of his past as well.       I love how he does such a great job of spreading it out and not limiting himself to one aspect of rapping like most rappers love to do these days. It's so refreshing to NOT hear crap like &quot;IF YOU F**K WITH ME, I'LL END YOUR LIFE&quot;, or &quot;WE'RE STRAPPED WIT GATS AND GUNS&quot; or &quot;e'rrybody in the club gettin tipsy&quot;. It actually fills me with happiness to know that hip hop is staying afloat (for now).
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Reality is a great escape.  The vocals are amazing and the hooks are addictive.  Bowie is a timeless legend and will always make great music.  I love that this album is outside the box and that the songs hit you.  The guitar rifts and editing are amazing.  The songs all belong together on this album and the sound is intoxicating.  The best songs are &quot;New Killer Star&quot; and &quot;Days&quot;.  &quot;New Killer Star&quot; has a driving beat and origanlity.  &quot;Days&quot; is a song that haunts you and the chord changes are so fluent.  The whole album is a detour from the usual.  This is music.
1586215833|3.0|I'm listening to the audio version of this book, and without going into great detail, I say it's worth a three-star rating. The one thing I wanted to get off my chest is that I wanted to strangle the narrator, Scott Brick, about a half-hour into the book. He could be a really fantastic book narrator (actor, really, as in a one-man-show) if it weren't for the irritating inflections he uses at the end of Every Darn Sentence. There are two. One being an incredulous note that, combined with the other, makes all the conversations sound like they are carried on between an old Jewish man and a Valley Girl. I really wanted to reach in there and grab him by the neck. Stop it!
6305537321|1.0|DIDN'T ANYONE READ THE BOOK?  Capote hated this film.  So do I.  I love Audrey Hepburn (\\"Sabrina\\" is a treat, \\"Funny Face\\" is sublime), but she isn't Holly Golightly.  This is one of my all time favorite books, and one of the great American masterworks of the 20th century.  Capote saw Holly as a young Marilyn Monroe type - sexy, manipulative, ignorant, bold and brash, but deeply vulnerable.  The script is one of the worst \\"adaptations\\" ever.  The only actor in this film who seems to bare any relation to a character from the book is Buddy Ebson as Doc.  He seems to have stepped out of a diffrent film.  A better film. I want to see THAT film!  Patricia Neal's character isn't in the book.  She's not bad (she was better as the negro maid in \\"Hud\\" - oops, I guess they changed that role from black to white for the film).  Mickey Rooney is an abomination as Holly's Japanese neighbor - I cringe just thinking about it.  Instead of Capote as narrator we have the VERY heterosexual George Pappard....if I go on I'm going to start drinking again.  PLEASE somebody make a good film of this beautiful story.  It's April of 2004 - Scarlett Johannson would make an ideal Holly (she's the perfect age - 19). Billy Bob Thornton would make a heartbreaking Doc.  Come on Hollywood, I dare ya!  Oh, on the positive side, I loved \\"Moon River.\\"
B000002TQV|5.0|So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star.  So you want to write and play music that will reverberate the eardrums of millions and pass the generations in precious timeless capsules of nostalgia.  So you want to write an album that stacks among the greatest collections of songs ever assembled.  Well, get in line, because the list of imitators is long and the sea of influences is wide.  <br />Not since the Beastie Boys innocently began rap's sampling parade (that eventually culminated in Puff Daddy reinterpreting a classic Zeppelin anthem) has there been so much outright borrowing of original material.  If you listen closely to any given new band, you can hear the history of rock all jumbled together in a neat little package, mostly grouped under a new movement that is being hyped like the second coming of grunge.  Although it could be argued that nothing is original anymore and that, like humans, all music has evolved and can be traced back further than primitive chants, the over sensationalized emo-indie-pop-rock genre has gotten old and boring rather quickly.  Its shelf life is dwindling into the shadows of the musicians that were the inspiration, with only a small, negligible flea bite of an impact made in the collective rock and roll consciousness.  <br />Interestingly enough, amid all the complimentary homage to classic acts as diverse as the Beach Boys and Television, there have been a handful of blatant replication attempts targeted at one landmark album: Radiohead's The Bends.   And rather than name names, it's more productive to try sending a message to future bands feeling ambitious enough to try the same thing...<br />Why try to replicate perfection when your attempts will only end up slapping you in the face of your own creativity?  The Bends knows no imitators.  It can kill anything in its path.  So don't even try; instead, just listen.  And as you listen, forget the existence of an album called OK Computer.  While you're at it, erase Kid A and Amnesiac from your memory.  Hail to the Thief is nothing but an eerily clairvoyant reference to the man who will become President Bush.  Radiohead has yet to innovate and radically change the way we listen to music.  <br />The Bends is a classic rock album, pure and simple.  Almost devoid of traceable influence, context, almost purely original, it pulls you in and connects your brain to its inhibitors.  Its strength lies in its ambiguous, overarching theme of mysterious discontent, carefully followed in a variety of incarnations from the spaced-out \\"Planet Telex,\\" to the gorgeous, driven \\"Sulk.\\"   From song to song you're blindsided, unable to see what you've left behind because you're already highly anticipating whatever's around the corner in front of you.  And not only is this a fitting, overly hokey namesake metaphor for the album itself, it also applies well to its creators.  <br />So instead of trying to keep up, bow down on the ground and lift your glasses instead.  Here's to the band that truly keeps us guessing and continues to surprise with restlessness as urgent as the official definition of \\"the bends\\" (as it relates to scuba/deep sea diving.  Look it up if you, like me, hadn't heard of it before listening to this album).  By the time legions of followers arrived on the scene to replicate The Bends (that would be the early 2000s and beyond...until these blokes suddenly figure out not to) good old Radiohead could be found onstage bending our minds yet again into the unknown, providing a hauntingly beautiful rollicking landscape for the next foray into the sonic unknown.  Let the journey continue this time without the followers slowing us all down. <br />In closing, for the sake of spurning an increase in originality, I leave all potential The Bends imitators with a notable quote to put in your pipe and inhale slowly, surely, and deliberately.<br />\\"You can't just copy somebody. If you like someone's work, the important thing is to be exposed to everything that person has been exposed to.\\" <br />-Bob Dylan (quote taken from 4/4/04 Los Angeles Times story)

B00003CX5P|4.0|Despite all the bashing it got from hard-core Star Wars fans, &quot;Episode I--The Phantom Menace&quot; was still very entertaining. The visuals are among the best I've seen, and the movie help my attention.<BR>The plot basically centers around Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). The military-like Trade Federation has blockaded the small, peaceful planet of Nabbo. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are sent in to act as ambassadors; however, the Federation turns on them and they end up fleeing to Naboo, where Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) is being forced to sign a treaty.<BR>After rescuing the Queen from the Federation, the Jedi take her to the (familiar to Star Wars fangs) desert-planet of Tatoonie, where they encounter a young boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Yoda and Samuel L. Jackson have cameos, and Ray Park plays Darth Maul.<BR>Like I said above, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is no classic, but I still enjoyed it. Jar Jar Binks, for all his clumsiness, was tolerable. The special effects were amazing, to say the least. I think the film's biggest problem was Jake Lloyd as Anakin. His acting was not convincing; you can really tell he's just some poor kid who got thrown into a huge franchise movie.<BR>So, whatever you may hear about it, &quot;Episode I&quot; is almost on par with the original trilogy. Did I mention the incredible bonus features on the DVD? It's definitely worth your money.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Heard a review on NPR today and had to pick up a copy before sundown. I wouldn't know the Queens of the Stone Age if they fell on me, but I do know the Eagles of Death Metal keep it fun and loose. &quot;San Berdoo Sunburn&quot; is a gem; the straight-up riffs and drum sound familiar, but there's something fresh in there that should make you smile. If you're looking for more than that, move along...
0345452577|1.0|This is BY FAR the worst Jonathan Kellerman book ever.  I have been reading JK for over 10 years and have read almost every book of his.  This book moved SO slow and he spent too much time building up characters that were not integral to the plot or at least not the murder mystery plot part.  He spent more time building a love relationship between the main character and his girlfriend than he did solving the crime.<br />1 word: BORING!  If you are a fan of JK, don't buy this one.  It has strayed too far from his main type of storyline.
B000002JR8|5.0|God what an awesome CD. The highlights are Becoming,5 minutes alone,I'm Broken,Slaughtered,25 years. But really all the songs are good. This is one of the few CD,s i can listen to all the way through. Pantera is by far the best metal band ever and Dimebag Darrell is awesome. Buy this CD by all means you wont regret it
0375713751|4.0|Having heard so much hype about this book, I had to buy it and check it out for myself.  I could immediately relate to the heroine, Kate, and overall, thought the story was a good one, if a bit on the \\"lite\\" side.  I did enjoy the story though, and thought the plot twists were funny and surprising.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Am I the only one who watched Revolutions 30 times and still has no idea what happened at the end?  I know trinity is dead, and that there was a big fight.  However, there is no closure to anything.  There is nothing to let the viewer know the fate that awaits Neo, other than a lot of light.  Furthermore, how did Neo beat Agent Smith.  Smith was beating Neo up, but then Smith basically explodes...how did that happen? The first two movies were great, this movie is fun to watch as well until the end.  You are left knowing less than when the movies started.

The songs are catchy with good beats.  Knowing the fact that the movie is based on a true story makes the murder a little disturbing...yet do not allow that to deny you from this incredible movie!  Also make sure to check out the Bonus Features on DVD.  Overall the movie is hilarious and amazing.  I'm not sure if I can find a word to describe just how great this movie is...well, maybe FAAABulous!!!
B0001VWP8I|5.0|On her 1st album, &quot;Not That Kind,&quot; I LOVED &quot;I'm Outta Love.&quot;  On her 2nd, I LOVED &quot;One Day in Your Life,&quot; the domestic version, the UK version, and the remixes.  I did not like the albums.  Finally, on her 3rd album, I am smitten with the whole project.  Still some retro influences, but her soulful voice seems oddly enough to fit in snugly with the edgier, rock-flavored tracks.  Although I'm aware that the bulk of this set was recorded while she was recovering from her breat cancer battle, this album sounds like she might have enjoyed it for itself.  I don't know, I just know that I can't wait to get to the end so I can start it over again.

Anybody who has watched the movie (and chances are if you have seen the movie once, you have seen it three times), has probably heard the wonderful music in the background.   This is an awesome soundtrack with a unified theme, I love it so much that I use it to pump myself up before shows, and audtions, and sometimes before basketball games!  It makes me feel REALLY energized.  I had such a good time listening to it, that I went out to get the band arrangment!  A definet MUST!
0060005688|5.0|In his new book The Paradox of Choice - Why More Is Less, Barry Choices. We're surrounded by them. Whether we're trying to pick out a new pair of jeans, shopping for car insurance, getting groceries, selecting a long-distance phone carrier, ordering a cup of coffee, or even deciding which spiritual path to follow, we're faced with a staggering amount of options. Just this weekend, my husband and I were shopping for a new dryer to replace the one that gave up the ghost. The amount of dryers was dizzying; they even had digital dryers! Like I jokingly told the salesman, when I do laundry, I don't want to have to do mathematical equations to figure out what numbers to key in...I just want to dry my freakin' clothes!<br /><br />The author contends that it's crucial for us to feel like we're in control, but in the face of so many options, is the process of selection back-firing on us?<br /><br />Schwartz contends that it is. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, the author shows how the dramatic explosion of choice--from the mundane to the profound--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. He tells the story of how he used to be able to go into a store and just get a pair of jeans. Being one to wear his jeans until they fall apart, he finally went to the store to get a new pair. A salesperson walked up to him and asked him if she could help. \\"I want a pair of jeans--32-38\\", he said. She proceeds to ask him if he wants them slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit, baggy, or extra baggy? Stonewashed, acid-washed, or distressed? Buttton-fly or zipper fly? Faded or regular?<br /><br />He was stunned. He sputtered that he just wanted regular jeans...you know, the kind that used to be the only kind? Schwartz then begins a mission to find out the range of choice for Americans. He goes on to list some pretty eye-opening statistics. For example, in his local supermarket, he found 285 varieties of cookies. Just the chocolate-chip cookies alone had 21 options! At his local electronics store, he counted 85 different telephones, not including cell phones. Even shopping for colleges has become an intellectual shopping mall.<br /><br />And speaking of malls, did you know that Americans go to shopping centers about once a week, more often than they go to houses of worship? American now has more shopping centers than high schools. However, when asked to rank the pleasure they get from various activities, grocery shopping ranks next to last, and other shopping fifth from the bottom.<br /><br />People are shopping more, but enjoying it less. But why? If they do enjoy it less, why do they keep doing it? This is the crux of the book, where Schwartz cites fascinating studies including Why Choice Is Demotivating. He also examines why it is that the excitement of purchasing new items seems to wear off so fast, and why we sometimes actually feel badly about our choices. For one, humans are adaptive. \\"Familiarity breeds contempt\\", as the old adage goes. But it's also the fact that we second guess ourselves after a purchase, mulling what we could have chosen, as well as asking ourselves if we really chose \\"the best\\".<br /><br />Choosing \\"the best\\" is a trait of maximizers. Schwartz says that maximizers tend to be less happy than satisficers. Satisficers are those who choose with the mindset of \\"good enough\\". But because America is a culture where many seek \\"the best\\" and compare their choices and lifestyle with their neighbors and media standards, most of us are maximizers.<br /><br />What are some of the qualities of a maximizer?<br /><br />1. Maximizers engage in more product comparisons than satisficers, both before and after they make purchasing decisions.<br />2. Maximizers take longer than satisficers to decide on a purchase.<br />3. Maximizers spend more time than satisficers comparing their purchasing decisions to the decisions of others.<br />4. Maximizers are more likely to experience regret after a purchase.<br />5. Maximizers aremore likely to spend time thinking about hypothetical alternatives to the purchases they've made.<br />6. Maximizers generally feel less positive about their purchasing decisions.<br />7. Maximizers savor positive events less than satisficers and do not cope as well (by their own admission) with negative events.<br />8. After something bad happens to them, maximizers' sense of well-being takes longer to recover.<br />9. Maximizers tend to brood or ruminate more than satisficers.<br /><br />Is it any wonder that we buy more, but enjoy less? What drew me to this book was because I knew that I was the type of person that obsessed over purchases, taking forever to select an item. I used to be so indecisive at a restaurant, taking 20 minutes to figure out what I wanted! What am I in the mood for? How will I feel when I eat it? What's the tastiest thing I could order? I'm much better than I was, but still... I also noticed the trend to second guess many of my purchasing decisions and wondering if I could \\"do better\\".<br /><br />So when I read about this book in Parade magazine, I ordered it from Amazon.com. The great thing about this book is that Schwartz synthesizes current research, and shows how eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He even offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices we have to make.<br /><br />Oh, and I picked my new dryer rather easily. I knew I wanted an interior light, a manual dial, large capacity, and a signal to let me know when the clothes were done. However, my husband kept standing there with a \\"deer in the headlights\\" look. (And finally agreed with my choice.)<br /><br />Do you think locking him in our bathroom with this book might help? Not a lotta choices in there, after all...urchases they've made.  6. Maximizers generally feel less positive about their purchasing decisions.  7.

630512762X|2.0|This movie has a great premise.  Take the face of your enemy and become him to destory him. But I promise you, if you have any intelligence what so ever you will realize that this the dumbest idea ever. At least whoever the hell wrote the movie, tried to make sense out of it, tried to make sense out of cutting your d*mn face off. But the whole thing could have been avoided if they had just beat the crap outta who they needed to get the info from. Nick Cage and John Travolta have no where near the same body. How'd they change that? Yeah, John lost weight but how'd Nick gain weight? You'd have to smoking rocks in order to believe they could pull this movie off, and then smoke more rocks to think that someone could be talked into having their face cut OFF.  If you buy this movie, you should also buy some Enron stock and book your flight for Iraq for that mid-summer vacation.  Trust me and keep your face on.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These movies are spectacular.  Everyone knows they are.  Many people a writing reviews criticizing Lucas, and there are other forums to do that.  What's worse, they're criticizing him before the entire storyline is finished.  For now, watch the movies, enjoy the adventure, and stop whining.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Part Greek tragedy, part teen-angst drama, part music video, part surrealist set-piece; Donnie Darko tells the story of a young man living, like a stranger, within his own family while dealing with very real demons of schizophrenia and self-imposed isolation and an (imagined?) demon in the form of a hellish looking 6' talking rabbit named Frank.  There is a seething undercurrent of rage, frustration, and teenage existential confusion throughout the movie, which is brilliantly woven together with supernatural and science fiction elements.  Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as the title character who's above-average intelligence and disconnected, fatalistic viewpoint and morbidly ironic sense of humor eerily portray the mindset many loners who find themselves on the fringe of high school society.  The \\"Sparkle Motion\\" dance sequence evokes memories  of Nirvana's \\"Teen Spirit\\" video with its slow-motion film style and backdrop of anarchic destruction intercut with a school talent show.  Notable performances given by Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and the star's real-life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal (playing Donnie's sister, Elizabeth Darko). The moody score and dark 80's new wave soundtrack heighten the sense that this movie conveys visually and narratively; a sense of foreboding and of imminent disaster and that the protagonist is on a journey of discovery, but one that may lead to answers he may not be prepared to cope with; one which he is compelled, like a prophetic dream, to see through to the end.  The DVD has the added bonus of containing the music video for Gary Jules' brilliant and haunting cover of Tears for Fears' \\"Mad World\\" which, now three years after it's inclusion in Donnie Darko, is gaining much deserved radio play.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Being a rabid fan of the original 'Matrix' film, I suffered through the second in anticipation of the Big Finish - and was wholeheartedly disappointed. My S/O and I were both laughing by the second hour. Cliched rah-rah/love-you-baby speeches that a ten-year old would write; philosophical hoo-hah so esoteric and amorphous that you start to wonder if even the Wachowskis have any idea what it means; too many repetitive CGI battle scenes. Squids, machine guns, squids, machine guns, repeat, repeat, repeat. Even the Machine City looked pathetic. I saw the first one and was inspired; I saw the second one and was confused. I saw the third installment and, as another reviewer put it so aptly, it was an autopsy. I wish they'd stopped after the first one.
B00004VXF2|1.0|I own half of this original double album on vinyl.  Thankfully I got it for free, because I might have otherwise bought it, being a big Lou Reed fan.<br />A lot of Lou Reed fans probably do buy this, especially since it was re-issued on CD.  I mean, you plunk down your hard-earned money for an album released by a major label, by an artist you admire, and you expect to get your money's worth.  Or at least an attempt to give you your money's worth.  If you want to buy it, at least try to find a store which will let you listen to it, before you pay your money.<br />If you have to have it anyway, to complete the collection, or if you really must insist it is brilliant, at least you will know what you are getting.  If you can't listen to it anywhere before you purchase it, tune your FM radio between stations.  That is basically it.  A double album of noise.  Honest.  A large enough number of reviewers here are saying it is just noise, that you should at least give us the benefit of the doubt, and try to find out for yourself before you spend your money.  Consider, it's far easier to imagine people trying to be clever by praising noise, than it is for so many people to randomly choose this one album to unfairly attack.  Isn't it?<br />My personal opinion is, whether it was bold and inspiring for Lou to release something as unexpected as a double album of noise or not, this is not something you need to pay for.  Truly original noise can be heard on your FM radio dial any time you want, for free.  If you like what you hear, you can record it yourself.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched the miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; then had to purchase the book!  One reviewer said it was not as &quot;real&quot; as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  Well, excuse me, but this was REAL!  Private Ryan was fiction. It was written and honed by Hollywood.  I am sorry that real life is not as exciting as fiction but this series was accounts of real men who actually lived this war!  I recommend this series to anyone interested in how war affects real soldiers. I have purchased the VHS of this (although I did tape it off HBO, loaned it to friends and never seen it again!) and will buy the DVD.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I have a huge collection of live music. I bought this cd last summer and since then it has become one of my favorites.  These are great performances of some of Skynyrd's best tunes. The sound quality is excellent. It comes neatly packaged and I believe its well worth $27. I would highly recommend it to any LS fan.
B0001LJCMK|3.0|This would appear to be demo tape recording of some songs that were never finished. Maybe it's me , but I think jangly loose production, raw drum feeds and false starts at the beginning of tracks were best left to The Beatles. It's not particularly crafted stuff this, and indeed is obviously done just for the fun of it. Nice to get paid loads for having a laugh though it must be, if I were them i'd want to leave something a bit more lasting (and satisfying) when I popped my cloggs.<br />You won't be listening to this after a couple of months, so you just have to ask yourself if you think the laugh was worth the cost of the CD. If not, drop a star from the rating. However, at least it's more original throwaway pop rock than most.
0380789035|1.0|With such a big book it's almost impossible to know where to begin. So let's go for page one: &quot;Shadow had done three years in prison...&quot;<br />So immediately, had I not known (from the title, the blurb, the hype and the simple self-awareness that comes with being a player in the whole reading 'thang') that what we were dealing with here was a fantasy-type novel, I'd imagine this to be some trashy crime housebrick of a read. Down-at-heel drifter falls out of clink and straight into complex plot involving lowlifes, hot women, guns and cash. The sort of thing Jim Thompson did with aplomb (and, heck, economically) and everyone else has been trying to copy for years.<br />I mean, 'Shadow', what's that? Shadow? My initial incredulity at that first line stayed with me for a long, long time and it's not until p261 (in my hardback version) that a half-hearted explanation comes along. It might appear a strange thing to get hung up on, but if you're going to call your main character Shadow, you better come up with something damned good with which to back it up and &quot;I'd just find adults and follow them around&quot; didn't do it for me. In my world that'd make your nickname Odd Boy, not Shadow. Shadow? No, there had to be more to it than that, not to mention all the strange things (a dead wife being the least of his worries) that happen to him, and before too long I'm afraid that any shocks and surprises concerning our man's past or destiny had been dissipated by putting the big fella in a pigeonhole marked 'big revelation coming up'.<br />Let's break away from him for a second.<br />The basic premise of the story, that the immigrants who came to America brought their gods with them is, I guess, an appealing one. Why not? You could imagine, say, Aldiss or Bradbury or Michael Coney getting some mileage out of a short story on that subject. But a 500 page hardback? 600+ softback? I began to wonder what it was Gaiman was hiding. Why all the detail, why the endless referencing of the scared ancients, why the tortuous details about bloody coin tricks? I'll admit I didn't get what it was, but I sensed a con coming along. I knew we'd have the rug pulled from under at some point. I spent most of the book waiting impatiently for the twist, muttering 'get on with it' at regular intervals.<br />It doesn't help when you're losing faith in something, for that faith to be stretched, but several times we're asked to suspend our disbelief ever higher: there're the gods of course, then we have zombies, talking ravens (Gaiman has clearly read MacDonald's Lilith), talking dogs, talking fire, talking bowls of chilli con carne. OK, so I made the last one up. Where were we? Oh, yes: a supposed clandestine agency; a murder mystery on Walton's Mountain; a protagonist who knows Herodotus, picks up council minutes as a casual read, gets access to a library and then never bothers to do a moment's research on his boss who happens to be the Norse god Odin (?!). Oh, and he dies and comes back to life too, did I not mention that? By the time we hit the revelatory segments, I was rolling my eyes to the heavens [sic] almost every five minutes.<br />It seems, all of it, completely aimless. It did me no good at all having zero sympathy or empathy for Shadow (Shadow?!). I simply didn't care about his plight, or Wednesday's, even. I couldn't drum up enthusiasm for the nearly dead gods, or the fully dead Laura, or anyone. Apart from Sam, who at least referenced the Onion, so is fairly likeable in that regard. Everyone else could go to hell in a handbasket as for as I was concerned. Oh, and hey, they do. Kinda.<br />As has been mentioned below, the battle/climax is woeful. You build up to something for what seems like an eternity (ho ho) and then say 'actually ...nah'? It's incredibly lazy, startlingly so. At the height of it he comes up with: &quot;The paradigms were shifting. He could feel it. The old world, a world of infinite vastness and illimitable resourcesand future was being confronted by something else - a web of energy, of opinions, of gulfs.&quot;<br />What? Sorry, what? It means nothing. Like Stephen Fry in Room 101, I have to confess that I do not have the requisite reservoir of splenetic juices to summon up just why I despise the misuse of the word 'energy' so very much. The ending, the denouements of the separate story threads, the pat conclusions, they're all so frustrating, and they're all run through with this dreadfully woolly language. Gaiman actually puts together a workable and efficient set of action sequences in the first half of the book (the plane journey where he meets Wednesday, the deaths on the train car, etc) but then falls down by talking about bloody 'energy' and simply finding Laura 'in a side cavern' (and riding giant birds, how throwaway and blink-and-you'll-miss-it is that? Eh? Come again?) This is draft 1 stuff, isn't it?<br />I understand that Gaiman used to write comics. Well, it seems he still does, he just forgot to include any pictures in this one.<br />Did any aspects of the book hold my attention? Maybe, and like I said, the initial premise is an interesting one, but the forgotten gods in the end are presented to us so quick-fire and one dimensionally that it's impossible to take them seriously at all. Like, there was a minotaur in there for a whole sentence, or am I mistaken? It's tiresome and dreary and ultimately Gaiman came across to this reader as someone who read some really great books about gods and felt he just had to get 'em all in.<br />My last word is reserved for the missing kids sub-plot. Hinzelmann didn't have a neon arrow pointing at him with IT'S THIS GUY writ large upon it, but he may as well have done. Outrageously transparent. Please tell me no-one was taken in by that?ources and future was being confronted by something else - a web of energy, of opinions, of gulfs.&quot;<br />What? Sorry, what? It means nothing.

B00005JMFQ|2.0|This film is guilty of the following crimes:<br />1. Typecasting Hugh Grant & Colin Firth in Richard Curtis type roles by Richard Curtis.<BR>2. Wasting Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman's acting talent with poorly developed roles.<BR>3. Leaving the only plot thread worth caring about (Emma Thompson's fine performance - hence the 2 stars) unresolved.<BR>4. Putting forth unbelievable character performances (Liam Neeson's Son & The Prime Minister's Maid being the worst).<BR>5. Putting forth unbelievable plot threads (most of them).<BR>6. Giving us a scene where a bloke stalks a woman with hand written placards, which manages to be both sickly and creepy at the same time, and leaves the audience unsure of whos meant to love who...actually!<BR>7. Turning up the sugary syrup quotient to an unbearable level two thirds into the film in the hope that no-one will notice that the director had bitten off more than he could chew.<br />In fact, I feel sick writing this. Buy \\"About a Boy\\" instead. It has acting and meaning, and is still warm and fuzzy without being barf inducingly ingratiating and over the top.
B00006AUIG|4.0|a scary film for people who think
0553274503|4.0|(I just want to preface this by saying i've only read the short story, not the actual novel, but i felt i had to get some opinions out there, so take it or leave it)<br />I found this story fascinating, since intellegence has always been something i've been trying to figure out. When i was 10 or 11, i was told that i have a very high IQ (not newhere near genius, but high nonetheless). Over the years i came to realise that intellegence is highly over-rated. Our society places way to much of an importance on intellegence, even so much that people think that if you are more intellgent, you are a better person.It is helpful, sure, but no more so than many other things, and it most certainly DOESNT make you a better person than anyone else. Also, there is terrible discrimination against stupid poeple. I have a good friend who is, and he faces much the same things Charly does, though mostly behind his back. Its terrible!<br />Anyways, thanks for reading my random rant. I hope this was helpful at all, and p-lease read this sotry/book, its awesome
B00005JMF6|3.0|I love good thrillers.  I am a Hitchcock fan for life.  I watched the movie last night.  I thought it was going to be a psychological thriller.  It was OK.  Too much blood! Halle earns three stars just for being in such great physical shape. Many of her escapades however did not follow any logic (i.e. she's riding home in s storm, calls her husband, he is not the least bit concerned, sees a bloodied ghost about the time he might have died; flashbacks provide a convoluted indication that she arrived home followed a trail of blood to her husband's body, supposedly chopped up by her.) Did the ghost take on her appearance to do the crime?  Now, if you go home and find lots of blood, are you going to stay?  Also, when Halle was being thrown around her cell and the surveillance cameras did not see a second person, was there something about the sheriff's knowledge of photography that was totally missed? Why did the kind guard give her his keys, when the whole place was in an uproar over her escaping her cell?  Now, I do have a question --who did butcher the husband, the ghost??  From the lost boy poster at the end, I can tell there a sequel is likely.  I won't feel drawn to see the sequel.  There are too many loose ends to make this thriller work.
0060254920|5.0|\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" was one of the first books to depict children as less than cherubic, but still completely loveable and forgivable. The imagery is dark, but appealling. The language is simple, but the meaning complex. The message is timeless: we all can be naughty sometimes, but most of us are lucky enough to have a place where we are \\"loved best of all\\". It's a terrific book.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones continues to deliver beautiful music that sounds like it's being sung to you and you alone. The criticisms about the softness of her overall tone are depressing and aggravating. One artist need not embody every tone or mood. It's okay to slow dance once in a while. Sometimes it's nice to have a romantic whisper close to the ear. In a bombastic and plastic soundscape where we have Christina Aguilera jack-hammering our skulls, Hillary Duff singing bubble-gum double entendres (\\"Come Clean\\"), and Jessica Simpson crinkling her nose to a point where I fear I shall go mad, Norah Jones continues to be a breath of cool, sweet air. One comment about the cover, and it's more of an amused observation than a criticism. After the suggestive lyrics to \\"Don't Know Why\\" (...I didn't come), apparently the cover's designers decided to go for another method of suggestiveness by positioning the title \\"Feels Like Home\\" at the level/in the proximity of the lovely Ms. Jones'...er, chest. \\"Feels Like Home\\" indeed! But maybe that just indicates that Norah sings from the heart! :-)
B000066NW0|4.0|I Love the CD it gives me insperation and helps my mind think, and I like the beats and rythym.<BR>I can understand that some people don't like her CD but thats no reason to put it down and curse about it, cursing will never solve anything. Some of us like her music. And yes, she does write her own songs. If you stopped trying to categorize her music and then you could enjoy her music. She is not a poser maybe shes just a mix up of styles, that express her. <BR>And who said that Avril hated her fans? That is not true, doesn't every pop star or singer love their fans? They are the ones who support celebrities.<br />Otherwise this is a great CD in my opinion, it describes what teenages might go through in their life.<BR>Oh, and just because you hate the artist doesn't mean you have to hate their music. Like me I like one song from Hillary Duff but I can't stand her. I don't know about you but I see music differently, I put it through my mind in images, just like Come Clean by Hillary.<BR>I also perfectly understand that some people can be horrendously annoying about different singers, don't bother with them, you've got the music that you like.
0156027321|3.0|This has been very popular, and gotten great reviews not to mention winning the Mann Booker award, but to be blunt, I didn't enjoy it much. The story was interesting and the main character, Pi, a sixteen year old boy, was wonderful.  But despite the fact that I read and enjoy the goriest murders and such in the thrillers that I love, this book was just too disgusting for me.  I did enjoy the first half - Pi's family owns a zoo in India, and reading about the lifestyle of a child being raised in a zoo was fascinating, as was learning about  all the animals, that was very interesting and informative.  And Pi's search for religious enlightenment was touching and at times, laugh out loud funny.  But the second half of the book is basically a survivor story, and it left me cold. I found myself skimming through pages of detailed information on one animal eating another while still alive, and various methods of staying alive while eating fish eyes and so forth. I just don't enjoy that sort of thing. Yes, the writing is beautiful and descriptive and the story is compelling.  But it's just gross.
B00006F83Y|5.0|First off, I'm going to have to say that Queens Of The Stone age is the best, most original band to come out of the music scene in the last 6 or 7 years.  They're truly original, and anyone who listens to their music knows that they are listening to something different.<BR>  Their latest offering, &quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot; is by far one of the best CD's I have ever heard.  Not only does it sound great, but musically it's flat out incredible.  I'm not a drummer, or even a Nirvana fan, but Dave Grohl is the man.  This Album also shows the musical genius of Josh Homme, who writes almost all of the material.  Anyone who slags this CD should take a step back and look at the music scene right now, and compare it to this band.  Gorgeous harmonies, Josh Homme's sweet vocals, pummeling drums, and killer guitars make this CD a must have.<br />&quot;You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire&quot;: 9/10.  This track slams you into the CD, as it's maybe the heaviest song on here.  With bassist Nick Oliveri doing his trademark depraved wildman howls, and Josh Homme playing simple, yet heavy and ballsy riffs, this song rocks.<BR>&quot;No One Knows&quot;: 10/10.  This song had the misfortune of being extremely overplayed on alternative radio, yet you listen to it and it never really tires.  Great rythms and vocals from Josh Homme.<BR>&quot;First It Giveth&quot; 10/10.  One of the best songs I personally have ever heard.  This is one of the tracks where you realize that Dave Grohl is simply incredible(and he uses a single bass pedal!). Cool harmonies, killer tempos; this song is absolutely killer.<BR>&quot;Song for the Dead&quot; 9/10.  Another heavy track, where the drums pound you behind Homme's and Oliveri's trademark Trance-like vocal chants.  Also the first track to prominently feature Mark Lanegan, who is one of the most unique singers of our time.  Killer Dave Grohl ending.<BR>&quot;The Sky Is Fallin'&quot; 10/10.  The trippiest, most trance-like song on the CD.  Put this on and just sit back and listen, as it is truly amazing.<BR>&quot;Six Shooter&quot; 8/10.  Easily the most underrated song on the album.  Simply put, this song is pure balls, with Oliveri just shredding his throat and going crazy.  This song is not filler!!  It was going on Nick's solo album when Josh Homme heard it and adamently suggested it go on 'Songs For The Deaf'.<BR>&quot;Hanging Tree&quot;  9/10.  The next song to feature Mark Lanegan, and, like all of the songs on this album, it is totally uniqe.  Lanegans vocals, are laidback and low, yet intense and emotional.  The propelling drums push this song to cool heights, while the effects-laden guitars give it true depth.<BR>&quot;Go With The Flow&quot; 10/10.  The second hit off the album, and it rocks.  The best, coolest, most tripped out four chord song I've ever heard, of which Dave Grohl can be thanked, as it's his drums that make it so unique.  It was also nice to see the killer video on MTV, nestled in between crap like Justin Timberlake and J Lo.<BR>&quot;Gonna Leave You&quot; 8/10. Featuring Oliveri on lead vocals, and showing that he is actually a talented singer, not just a screaming madman.  However, while this track does shine, I find it personally to be the least interesting on the CD.<BR>&quot;Do it Again&quot; 8/10.  Like &quot;Gonna Leave You&quot;, only better.  Homme sings lead on this, as he is the primary singer in the band.  Great groove song for playing in your car with the windows down.<BR>&quot;God Is In the Radio&quot; 10/10.  Great song about the commercialization and hypocrisy of organized religion.  Lanegan sings lead on this, and it's just a really cool jammed out song that displays the band's dynamics.  Sweet chorus too.<BR>&quot;Another Love Song&quot; 10/10.  Definitely one of my favorites.  I think the simplicity of it make this song the most overlooked.  Listen to it and you'll see it's like a mid-60's, psychadelic rock song, with background chanting thatgives it a dark, almost satanistic vibe.  Oliveri is on vocals again, although it isn't as obvious.  Just a really cool song.<BR>&quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot; 10/10.  Heavy, melodic, Queens Of The Stone Age.  Awesome drums, cool lyrics, and raw energy makes this track one of the standouts.  Definitely one of the best, creepiest songs on the CD.<BR>&quot;Mosquito Song&quot; 10/10.  Listen to this song with the lights out when you go to bed, and you'll appreciate it a little more.  Definitely the standout track.  P.S. It's about chasing some guy through the woods and eating him alive.  F****'in creepy.<br />Thanks, and hail to The Stone Age!!
B00005B36H|5.0|i must say that this is definately tool's best album to date.  the music is tight and intricate and splashed with vivid color and beautiful lyrics.  most listeners won't get it the first time that they hear it.  for most it just goes over their heads and is too much to take in- preffering shorter and more radio friendly (catchy) songs to enjoy.  for anyone wanting to take a trip beyond what is considered &quot;music&quot;, i highly suggest this masterpiece.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson manages to convey wit, humor, insight, and information in a way that is unmatched. He's every bit the ideal travelling companion. I found this book to be thoroughly engaging and informative, and I was sorry to finish it.
B00003CXA2|3.0|Ok, ok. This is a good picture .And Tom Hanks is definately at the top of the bar. And any true Tom Hanks fan must add this to their collection. I just have to ask you, have you seen the picture SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  Yes ?, Well which picture do you think was better. ?  Right.  So why did GUMP steal the Best Picture Academy Award that year?  I know I need to let this go, but this is the only thing I have against this fine picture.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|The DVD is awesome to say the least!  Seeing the DVD after seeing the TV showings of this concert was like stepping back through all the years I grew up with this woman's awesome talent and music.  Seeing the DVD made me want to go see the concert in person when it came to my city.  This tour was truly fabulous and a shining tribute to Cher.  She truly is THE - ONE - TRUE - DIVA!
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin..Only together for 10 years..and NO they did not BREAK UP..The band lost a very close friend when Bonzo died and together decided that Led Zeppelin simply could not continue without him..A decision I regret that they made but I deeply respected them for it..I am a drummer and have been for close to 40 years..Bonzo is the reason I picked up drums in the first place..As for Led Zep IV..no doubt a very very solid album..though my personal favorite is still Led Zep I, this is in a close second..The only thing I have ever not liked about this album is that it contains both Stairway To Heaven and The Battle of Evermore..My opinion is that if The Battle of Evermore had been on a diifferent album it may have been as huge a classic as Stairway..certainly a lot more intricate in layered vocals, mandolins sitars, and guitars..the song is a musical masterpiece in contrast to the siplicity of Stairway..Not taking anything from Stairway it is about as good a wriiten song as you have or will ever hear..The Amazing thing about Led Zeppelin is that they were always on a musical journey..no 2 albums were alike and no 2 songs sounded the same..even in concert the band re-arranged songs..played things differently from one night to another..Man you want to know why there is such a huge demand for unreleased live material..because Led Zeppelin JAMMED in concert not just played their songs so one night was totally different from another..And when a band is as good as this..you gotta have all you can get your hands on..Jimmy Page admittedly is NOT the greatest guitar player in the world..But he IS the greatest guitar COMPOSER that has ever been. Listening to Led Zeppelin from Led Zep I (My All Time Favorite Still) all the way thru In Through The Out Door is a magical, mystical musical journey..If you are a new fan of Led Zep, I recommend strongly that you buy them and listen to them in the order they were made. Read why Page did things the way he did in response to music critics from one album to the next..it will amaze you. Do you know why for instance that Led Zeppelins Fourth album was released with absolutely nothing written on the cover..No band name no album title..I grew up with this music..read the Rolling Stone Paper and other magazines as each release was rated and critiqued..and with each critical review that set the band awash and crashing..Page came back with the next album that smashed them to the ground and drug them thru mud..you would think that after a few albums thet gained momentum not only in musical scope but in real musical genius as well that they the critics would bow and beg forgiveness..but they never did..always predicting the demise of Led Zep.. When they had the nerve to say that Led Zep was selling albums because of their name after Led Zep III, Page released Four with nothing on the cover and it became the highest selling album in the history of Rock and Roll. Did the critics stop No..But neither did Jimmy Page and he ALWAYS came out the victor..

1592400876|5.0|Maybe one has to be an English teacher to love this book, but I am and I did. It's always encouraging to discover someone else who shares one's own obsessions.  I too am enraged by the ubiquitous misuse of quotation marks (not the same thing as \\"quotes,\\" incidentally, even in the US). And as Ms Truss points out in the chapter on the apostrophe, differentiating \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" is so simple -- there's NO EXCUSE for confusing them.  Also I was delighted to learn that the comma I was taught to include and my children were taught to omit is known as the \\"Oxford comma.\\"<BR> Many of the other customer reviewers seem to have missed the point of this book: it is a funny book about a serious matter, not the other way around.  If you cringe every time you see an RV with \\"\\"The Smith's\\"\\" emblazoned across the back, you will enjoy Eats,Shoots and Leaves.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I keep hearing people say that they want the originals.  Well, if you watch the special editions you would realize why he is not releasing the originals.  Cause they are gone.  The elements had corrupted them so badly that if they had not made the special editions, Star Wars would be gone totally.  And persoanly, i like the new effects.  It makes the films looks \\"more real\\".  And the added scenes were nice.  I like learning more about why Jabba is mad at Han without having to read the whole Han Solo Trilogy book set.  And the new Death Star attack sequence was great.<br />Besides..when it comes down to it, its his movies.  We didn't write them.  It is his universe and his imagination.  Apparently he envisioned it with the extra scenes.  I like the special editons cause they add more story to the already great story.<br />The only thing i wish he had included in the bonus disk (which maybe he did and we just don't know it yet) are some of the other deleted scenes that he never put in.<br />But overall, the changes were good to keep up with the times and the story was just made better.  Besides, you can't release the originals if they are gone.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Listening to this reminds of the part in the movie Ghost World where a woman is talking to the blues collector and says &quot;If you want to hear real blues you have to hear 'Blues Hammer'&quot; and this cheesy electric guitar playing white boy comes out singing about picking cotton.  EC is not that bad but there is no way for ANYONE to tackle the original material of Robert Johnson.   But don't take my word for it, just listen to the complete recordings of Johnson and then this back to back.  I give EC credit for possibly getting more people interested in Johnson's work though.
B0001D0FTW|4.0|I was first introduced to Edguy's music through lists of top metal albums here on Amazon.com, where &quot;Theatre of Salvation&quot; was repeated again and again. This is my second Edguy album, and it does not disappoint, although it is wholly different from &quot;Theatre&quot;. The overall tone of the album is much darker and heavier than &quot;Theatre,&quot; and has a much stronger &quot;true metal&quot; feel than many of the tracks on the opera-like &quot;Theatre&quot;. Many of the songs here are mid-tempo paced, yet retain their heaviness, catchy melodies, and awesome choruses. While it's truly tough to choose the &quot;best&quot; tracks on this album, because they are generally all well-done (even the silly &quot;Lavatory Love Machine&quot;), I particularly enjoyed &quot;King of Fools&quot;, &quot;The Piper Never Dies&quot;, and &quot;Under the Moon&quot;. &quot;Down to the Devil&quot; has a great guitar solo as well.<br />In a nutshell, if you enjoy melodic metal (Dio, Iron Maiden, Hammerfall, etc.), &quot;Hellfire Club&quot; delivers. The guitar work is great and Tobias Sammett has an amazingly powerful voice in the vein of Bruce Dickinson and Queensryche's Geoff Tate. Recommended!!
B00004T9UF|5.0|It would be trite to say that those who don't like it don't get it; there is certainly weight in arguments concerning occasional flaws in production, Eminem's 'shady' singing skills and moments in which the 'voice of troubled youth' is a little more youthful then this otherwise poignant, mature release sets as it's standard. Having said that, one can't help but consider the extent to which those who badmouth the 'Marshall Mathers LP' invariably fail to grasp quite the handle Eminem seems to have on the dissociative, anti-social, pseudo-rebellious trends in our young generation. The irony, of course, is that those who so vocally don't quite understand are the causal link that creates such phenomenon by which they are so confused and irritated. My annoyance of the ignorant aside, this album is a witty, articulate example of someone who not only connects with the voice of intelligent, angry youth but communicates it with breathtaking skill. Guest appearences (regretably fast becoming the hallmark of his predecessor Dr. Dre) are kept to a minimum and what we are left with is a series of masterly woven tales of anger, frustration confusion, egotism and indulgence. Rather then exploit the  'born on the streets' element permeating so much of rap at his time, as if all involved are competing for credibility, Eminem focuses his subject matter on this recording on his confusion as to his status as a 'kid who got rich' and role model, as to his societal place and perceived requirements of such and as to his desire to just 'be a young person' with all the indulgence and wrecklesness that entails. I empathise to where he's at here and can only admire the way he brings that to me as a listener in a way that connects with me musically as well as politically.
0767817486|4.0|I have read some of the reviews posted here for this movie and they almost laughable. People need to lighten up a bit and stop being so goddam politically correct. This true life story is a Hollywood dramatization folks. Its purpose is to entertain. And I for one am not ashamed to say that I would watch this movie just to look at Brad Davis in the buff. Nuff Said.
0060934700|5.0|There is so much variety in this book you'd think it wasn't written by the same person, but it is, and how well it was done.<br />Most of it pertains to sci-fi/fantasy, as that is what Gaiman usually writes. Some of the stories are truly touching, some haunting, and some very funny.<br />There are about 30 short stories and poems. <BR>There are brief introductions to each piece, which is very interesting.<br />Good for a read every now and then or all at once. Good stuff that you will remember for a long time after reading it. It blew me away, especially the last two stories, &quot;Murder Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples.&quot; Those were the most memorable and well written, in my opinion. Just like they say, save the best for last.
0618001905|3.0|The story in &quot;King Leopold's Ghost&quot; is a powerful one -- colonization taken to its extreme -- but the book is rendered mediocre by the author's trite moralizing, lack of historical rigor, and tiresome reliance on depicting every actor with either a halo or horns.<br />Hochschild's constant speculation into motives and fits of amateur psychoanalysis made it difficult to separate the matters of record from dramatic characterizations. The substantive research is rather thin and commonly presented in relative terms such as &quot;many&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, and &quot;few&quot; without context for comparison. At no point did I gain a clear insight into how widespread or coordinated were the atrocities or how damaging the secondary effects may have been (the chapter addressing this is awfully feeble). Leopold, here an antagonist of extraordinary guile, is only weakly connected to the governmental and business interests with which he worked; the reader is given pages of anecdote concerning the king's depravity with nearly no overview of the system in which he operated.<br />The final chapter is a model of the book's flaws. It considers the Belgian process of forgetting which followed their foray into colonialism, aided by international sympathy during the first world war. Instead of pursuing this interesting and somewhat complicated topic in more detail, however, we are duly regaled with additional vignettes of heroism and villainy. The book then concludes with a sermon aimed squarely at us in the choir. While some readers might find this inspirational, it bored me.<br />Assuming that research into the history of the Belgian Congo is ongoing, I'll look for a more definitive and less melodramatic account.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|I coudn't agree more with moviegrlll-- how any self-respecting woman could find Jack Nicholson's character (and his real self) appealing to the point of givung up one's autonomy and self-respect  is mind-boggling, and a bunch of patriarchal propaganda horsecrap.
B00005JMEW|4.0|What a terrific movie.Fast paced and a great story. Taratino's use of different cinematic styles really keeps one riveted to the screen. Of course the action/fight scenes are overblown but Uma is fabulous. Can't wait to see Vol.2.
0743454529|5.0|I discovered this book by accident while browsing. I had never heard of Jodi Picoult, but the title and the cover illustration caught my attention. As soon as I read the jacket blurb, I knew that I had to read this book. I started reading and before I knew it, the story was over and my kleenex box was empty. I suggested this book to the other women in my book club before my copy even arrived--I was positive that it was going to be something we needed to read, and so far we've all had the same reactions. The book draws you in and doesn't let go. By allowing almost all of the characters to narrate the chapters(notice the individual fonts for each character), you can really get a feeling for their personalities, with the exception of Kate (for reasons explained towards the end).<br />Ms. Picoult has listed some discussion questions on her website that are thought-provoking. There are more; is Anna's name indicative of her role? Are certain things in life pre-destined and therefore inescapable? Who are we to &quot;play god&quot;, but where do we draw the line when it comes to helping our loved ones? With life, do we measure by quantity or quality? At the end of the story, you are left pondering the title. Is Anna or is Kate &quot;My Sister's Keeper&quot;?
B00008S2VG|2.0|I found this record to drown under the weight of its own  pretensions. I know, I know. Madonna needs to continually evolve as a serious and spiritual artist, and is unable to artistically go back to her roots ie. to music people truly enjoyed. As a woman that thrives on being unpredictable, Madonna would be really doing something bold and &quot;cutting edge&quot; if she challenged herself to return to the tight linear hooks, and simple concise lyrics that made her famous to begin with.  Trust me when I say that 20 years from now, no song from this album will be playing on the radio. But I bet Borderline will be.
B00004Z400|4.0|While &quot;Adrenaline&quot; (probably my fav.) and ATF were amazing in their own right, &quot;White Pony&quot; was a major step forward for the 'tones. Here, they focus a little more on ambiance and build on their songs from beginning to end moreso than ever on songs like &quot;Digital Bath&quot; and &quot;Passenger&quot;. Yet, they still managed to keep their hard edge with possibly their hardest song to date, &quot;Elite&quot; (I don't know what that reviewer who said &quot;Korea&quot; was the hardest was thinking). By anyone's else's standards, this is the achievement of a lifetime. However, with by Deftones' standards this doensn't reach 5 star status. While songs like &quot;Street Carp&quot;, along with the highly experimental (for the 'tones) &quot;Teenager&quot;, aren't complete flops, they come up a little short of the genious of the rest of the album. <br />Oh, one other note. I'm glad I have the origional version, without &quot;Back to School&quot;, because it's a horrible song and Chino knows it. He openly regrets making that song (it's a shortened and slightly altered version of &quot;Pink Maggit&quot;), which he did just to shove it to the man by showing how easy it is to make a hit single after they were accused by the radio stations of going soft.<br />Other songs to check out are: &quot;Feiticeira&quot;, &quot;Knife Prty&quot;, &quot;Change (in the house of flies)&quot;
B00005JMEW|1.0|The worst movie I ever viewed, made no sense at all, I fell asleep twice. What a joke!! And Those ugly toes, why didn't they just cut them off and just have Uma walk around on bloody stumps to a Burger King. And on the way, falling into the wood chipper from Fargo. And what about the whole story line of a bride getting shot in the head, why? didn't she put out? I mean she did pretty a good job while in the coma. Even  Repoman and Rabbit proof fence beat this on by a mile.
B000006YMN|5.0|She has such an amazing voice! I had the cassette tape of this years ago and lost it.  I plan on buying the CD soon!  Every song is fantastic!  Well worth buying!  I'm surprised it didn't do well nationwide.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye if he only releases this CD will go down as one of the greatest ever. This CD is a classic. Kanye has his tongue stuck deep in his cheek and his middle finger way up in the air. And even while dropping hilarious rhymes (Workout Plan), Kanye gets political on tracks like All Falls Down (which MTV censored for its &quot;white man&quot; line). A truly amazing CD. Congratulations to Kanye!
0393316041|5.0|This book contains by far the most astounding collection of stories I have ever read in a single work.  The sentences move together smoothly, and every single one of them is interesting in some respect.<br />I usually do not read books because of the great deal of time involved in getting into the plot, but with this one, you can easily sit down and read a section and get right down into it.  It's that well-written, with enough details to keep you intrigued and at the same time focused.
0380789035|4.0|Read this if you're looking for something completely out of the ordinary, more occult than sci-fi or fantasy.  Masterful descriptions bring this dark, morbid world to life.  Gaiman crosses dimensions of life, the afterlife, and otherworlds like a camera cuts between scenes.  You will be changed, long after you put the book down. Gaiman &quot;shines.&quot;
B00009W0U4|5.0|I don't know where to begin.  I never deal with a sysnopsis when I review on here because I feel there are already plenty of them.  The story is extremely simple - a rape/revenge story told in reverse.  This film is often compared to Momento due to this reverse storytelling.  However, whereas Momento is a puzzle movie, and the device seems more gimmick then anything else, Irreversible uses the technique to convey its message more powerfully.  That message is, quite simply, one of inevitability and if you are not moved by the end of the film, then you must just be in shock.  <br />The violence is intense, but hardly excessive.  The beginning of the film is frenetic but, as it progresses/regresses, it becomes more and more serene.  Every aspect of the film - editing, cinematography, the pacing of the dialouge, setting - support this form.  The effect is powerful, intellectually and emotionally.  This film is not about shock and it will be remembered as a milestone in later years.
B000053VJI|5.0|JUAN LUIS GUERRA of the hit Dominican band, GRUPO 440 (Cuatro Cuarenta)* is by far \\"EL REY\\" amongst his peers even though he still hasn't recorded for sometime. Yet, if I'm not mistaken he has turned to CHRISTIAN LATIN MUSIC and let me say that I had a chance this past 14th February 2004 to witness a truly magnificant performance, \\"CONCIERTO DEL AMOR\\" @ Madison Square Garden with Salsero GILBERTO SANTA ROSA. I have to be honest that I preferred the performance by JUAN LUIS GUERRA de GRUPO 440 over GILBERTO SANTA ROSA.<br />Luis Ricardo Irizuri e Jaunarena<BR>\\"CLARO, LOCO!\\"

B00005JMEW|2.0|I found this movie highly predictable and way more violent than any of the other movies. .<BR>The only really good moments are when they're playing a good piece of obscure music... ie, the intro song &quot;Bang Bang&quot; sung by Nancy Sinatra.<br />My favorite moment was when the flute music plays at the end. (not a spoiler) I kept thinking what Japanese song this was and then I had the strange idea it could be Zamfir, but thought if it was it would be kind of a geeky joke between Tarentino and the few people who actually remember those tv ads for the panflute recordings... And by jove... the song is called &quot;the Lost shepherd&quot; performed by Zamfir. ;)<br />If nothing else, I'll get a nice soundtrack of music from this movie. That's a guarantee with Tarentino movies. :D<br />~L~ who's giving her copy of Kill Bill to her brother
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 really work best when you consider them two parts of a whole. Combined, they tell a whole story and each one has what the other lacks. Volume 1 had style, razzle-dazzle filmmaking, a fast pace, lots of action and gallons and gallons of blood. Volume 2 lacks most of those qualities and instead gives us tried-and-true Quentin Tarantino dialog, more character development, and the biggest surprise of all, real human drama. <br />Dialog, yes. Lots and lots of it. Tarantino makes up for the fact that there was little of his brilliant dialog in Volume 1 by making the follow-up (not a sequel) a thoroughly talky affair. The Bride (Uma Thurman) and Bill (David Carradine) in their long-awaited confrontation, duel not with swords, but with words. Both actors turn in excellent performances which I hope will be remembered next year at the Oscars. <br />Indeed, this film is a major change of pace after the bloody mayhem of Kill Bill, Volume 1. It has the look and feel of a western (complete with references to Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah and others) as opposed to the primarily Eastern feel of the previous volume. Many viewers who enjoyed Volume 1 only for its action and bloodshed will no doubt be disappointed by this. However, Tarantino obviously had more in mind for Kill Bill and intended for it to be much more than just a brainless action flick which pays tribute to many samurai and kung fu movies. In Volume 2, he gets down to the nitty gritty and shows that he's trying to make a real film of real substance. Of course, (...) as the showstopping fight between Uma Thurman and Darryl Hannah reveals, but he's less interested in wowing the audience with action and violence.  <br />Highlights include a scene where The Bride is buried alive which is made frighteningly effective by the brilliant use of sound effects, and a flashback to The Bride's training under kung fu master Pai Mei (played by Gordon Liu). David Carradine simply lights up the screen with his charismatic portrayal of Bill, straddling the line between murdering criminal and lovable human being. It's shocking how far this character is from the samurai-sword-stroking faceless villain that we got only a peek of in Volume 1. <br />Quentin Tarantino just may have made his masterpiece with Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2. He has managed to take the films that influenced and inspired him and turned them into something completely new and wholly Tarantino. Considering both parts as a whole, it adds up to a great movie that will be remembered for a long time to come.

A Must Own for Every Collection!!!
B000068QY7|4.0|This is a much anticipated album for people who go to Bang and Popscene on a regular basis. Or if you have picked up a British music magazine lately. It hasn't been a very good year for Britpop. Blur and Suede have disappeared. Pulp put out a record that was never released in the US and then they got dropped from their label. In the meantime people have been filling up their time listening to bands like Elbow and Starsailor. The first Oasis single came out, &quot;The Hindu Times,&quot; and it sounded like a return to rock and the sound of the earlier albums. Yet all the initial reviews have been sort of waffling. Has Noel Gallagher lost it. He only wrote a little more than half the album. This time out he has a little help from his friends: Liam wrote three tracks, new members Gem Archer and Andy Bell supply one song each. Also ex-Smiths member and free floating collaborator Johnny Marr shows up on a few tracks here.<br />The record starts out with three rocking tunes: &quot;The Hindu Times,&quot; &quot;Force of Nature.&quot; and &quot;Hung in A Bad Place.&quot; The first sounds better than anything from the previous two records. Noel sings &quot;Force of Nature&quot; that also seems like a return to the first record Definite Maybe that was filled with songs about aspirations and optimism. Gem Archer's &quot;Hung in A Bad Place&quot; sort of works out of a Stooges two chord assault. All three seem more crafted after repeated listenings. Where people might have expected a rock record, most of the great songs on this album are slower ballads. &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; is one full of feeling and loss. Liam's ballad &quot;Songbird&quot; recalls country tinged songs by Dylan and Lennon. The songs have a little more substance than the previous efforts, and there is no songs as bad as &quot;Little James.&quot;<br />The events of September 11th seemed to have made an impact on Noel. His response is &quot;Little By Little&quot; which is a far better song than Paul McCartney's &quot;Freedom.&quot; The album ends with two great songs by Noel, including the Beatlesque &quot;Probably All In The Mind&quot; and the acoustic based &quot;She is Love&quot; which Noel also sings in an uplifting way. Then there's two by Liam, including the spacey and dark &quot;Born On A Different Cloud&quot; that begs to be included on The White Album, and the all out rocker &quot;Better Man.&quot;  There's also a bonus track after waiting twenty minutes. But overall it's a good album and probably their second best. Being in America, we don't read about the Gallagher brothers and their love hate relationship in the press all the time. We don't have a sense of growing up with them as many people in the UK do. The people who love Oasis will probably embrace this as evidence of their continued life. Most of us in America only feel that way with Dr. Dre and Beck. Oasis still plays packed football stadiums in Europe. While America only shows up in numbers for Ozzy, Rolling Stones, The Who, and U2. Most of these bands did their best work around 25 years ago. Well, maybe if Oasis stays intact, Americans will finally get their head the Oasis story in 15 year's time?<br />([...]ul McCartney's &quot;Freedom.&quot; The album ends with two great songs by Noel, including the Beatlesque &quot;Probably All In The Mind&quot; and the acoustic based &quot;She is Love&quot; which Noel also sings in an uplifting way.

B000001FXT|4.0|While it is true that Bob Marley was not the FIRST Reggae singer, he was certainly the most famous.<br />This unique reggae beat, with the pulsations of black nationalism, was released in 1979, and has since make it's mark in the world of music. It starts with the hearty lamentation of \\"So Much Trouble in the World\\" and is followed by \\"Zimbabwe\\" which was a song of inspiration for Zimbabwe's guerrillas fighting for Black majority rule in that country during the Rhodesian War/ War of Independence. Marley performed at Zimbabwe's independence celebrations of 18 April 1980. He did not know that the performance on the first day would be reserved for the special guests of the new elite. When the masses tried to attend the concert they where tear-gassed and hounded out the stadium by Mugabe' s militia.<br />Marley responded by singing \\"War\\". The next day his performance was subdued as he was already disillusioned by the behaviour of the new Mugabe regime.<br />Today the song `Zimbabwe' is sung as an anthem of Zimbabwe's pro-democracy movement as are other Marley hits like ` Get Up, Stand Up\\"<br />It is clear that Marley would not have approved of the genocidal dictatorship that Mugabe built up, in the last 24 years, any more than he did the white minority government of Ian Smith.<br />There is the angry condemnation of the `Babylon System' and the Black Nationalist anthem  \\" Survival\\" with the lyrics \\" Were the survivors! The Black survivors!\\"<br />This was one of my first albums so the heady beat of this album holds great memories for me.<br />\\"Africa Unite\\" is another is an ode to Marley's idealistic dreams of Pan African unity. And ` One Drop' is spiritual rendition of the longing for a true spiritual Rastafarian quest for authentic ideas of Haile Sellasie (the Christ of Rastafari) and Marcus Garvey.<br /> \\" Give us the teachings of his majesty. We don't want no devil's philosophy\\"<br />You can always put your own interpretations and feelings into these songs , and my own conception of the sentence sung above may be different to that of most Marley devotees.<br />But then that only go's to show the genius of Bob Marley, doesn't it?n conception of the sentence sung above may be different to that of most Marley devotees.<br />But then that only go's to show the genius of Bob Marley, doesn't it?
B00005JMCN|4.0|Toby Maguire and Jeff Bridges star in this factually based picture about a financially struggling racehorse owner and unknown jockey who battle all odds with and old neglected nag and end up winning the Kentucky Derby. I don't mind giving that tidbit away because the ending is a plain as can be from about 2 minutes into the movie. However, that's where the complaints end - it's well acted, very enjoyable, and impressively filmed in all senses, and although it won't I'm sure set anyone's world ablaze, it is one of the better offerings on DVD of late. The widescreen is a must for the racing scenes, and one or two nice extra's on the DVD, outweigh the VHS option. Enjoy
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is to me, one of the greatest books of all time.  I give this book a five star.  I think this book is about children's curiosity and harsh reality of racism.  The book is narrated by a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, who is usually called Scout.  She has an older brother named Jem Finch and a dad named Atticus Finch.  In the first part of the story, Jem and Scout are curious about Boo Radley.  Boo Radley is a very mysterious man and both Jem and Scout have never seen him before, but have heard things about him, mostly bad.  The story then goes on to talk about Tom Robinson, a poor black man accused of raping Mayella Ewell.  Atticus, who is a lawyer, will defend Tom Robinson throughout the book in any way he can, but fails.  Tom is convicted for something he did not do, mainly because of his color.  The trial will deeply affect Jem and Scout's lives forever; and they will also realize, at a young age, the cruelty that comes with racism.  <br />I would have to say that I get into and love reading books that deals with racial issues.  I am bound to be touched in some way shape or form when I read books that involves racial conflicts or issues.  I like books the deals with racial issues because for the most part, I know what one character is going through.  As a minority, I have unfortunately experienced some racial conflicts/ issues that I would not think would happen this day in age.  Unfortunately there are still people out there who aren't well educated enough to realize that everyone is different in their own ways, but should not be judge in any way shape of form.  I honestly think that the only way to solve racial discrimination is through education.
0671027344|5.0|&quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; in many ways, reminded me of of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; with one exception - I cared about the characters.  Stephen Chbosky weaves a tale of teenage life - angst, love, infatuation, friendship, pot and booze, and not fitting in.  The main character, Charlie is just as observant as Holden Caulfield ever was - but replaces resentment and anger with genuine facisnation with people and life in general.  You find yourself *caring* what happens to Charlie, Sam, Patrick and Mary Elizabeth.  This is a book which so beautifully describes adolescense - using a perfect combination of poetry and prose, along with poignant observations - that it will make you feel every range of emotions possible.  I recommend this book highly.
0385335482|5.0|This book is amazingly hilarious. I generally hesitate to buy pink covered books, thinking they target female readers. This book reflects a few months in Rebecca's daily life, she is addicted to buy things even she exceeds the budget. She has many original ways to escape from debts. You will find you have many in common with Rebecca. I couldn't stop my laughters while reading the book in the middle of the night.
B0001I55OC|2.0|To put it simply, Timeline is just one of those movies where you're better off watching the trailer than the actual film itself. A sci-fi/historical adventure flick, timeline's plot involves a son along with a bunch of comrades goin through a wormhole to rescue his father from the 14th century. Of course they arrive at the exact date of a major assault by the french on the english garrason in the village of castle gaurd.<br />This may all sound very exciting, but in practice it is not. The movie doesnt feel very exciting at all and in fact I lost interest half way through. The acting is well below par and the plot is just very uninvolved. The special effects too were not at all very stunning, and nothing about the movie rated all that well with me. Its too bad too, because the preview for the movie looked pretty good... oh well they already got my money to rent it.
B00005R0VH|5.0|layla and other assorted love songs is pure and simple a truely great love album.  Eric Clapton had fallen so head over heals for George Harrison's wife that he had to express his feelings and the only way he could was to write beautiful songs like he did on this album.  The title track &quot;Layla&quot; stands out as probably Eric Clapton's best song ever.  The guitar is claptonesque and the lyrics are so deep and desperate.  I personally have never heard a song of this type where its so hard at the beggining then completely changes into a great piano ballad.  I would probably say that Layla is the greatest rock ballad of all time, and really was the pioneer of all of the eighties love ballads to come.  This album is simplistic and arranged so beautiful.  Clapton really did not plan any of this out, it seems almost like it just came to him one day and these are songs that he wrote in minutes perhaps.  this album really does kick ass, its so good, and i put it right up there with any dylan or beatles album because it has that classic feel to it that you can't go wrong with....clapton is god on guitar, just thought i would add that
B0001I55OC|1.0|This is the worst time travel movie ever made and may be amongst the top 20 worst movies ever made period.  I am more entertained by reading, in disbelief, the reviews of those that actually liked it than I ever was at any point during this movie.  It is atrocious.  Do NOT waste any money only this turkey.
B000002U8G|5.0|shhhh, children, settle down. this is not the place to argue about whether a cd sucks or if it's a masterpiece. i think what we need is for some other people to write reviews.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|There are very few times that a director puts songs to a film and actually end up MAKING the movie.  Kill Bill 1 &amp; 2 are perfect examples of this.  The music was imperative to the mood of the film.  It worked.  Oh yes, it worked.<br />Though the CD is strong all around, two songs blew my socks off on Volume 2.  About Her, by Malcolm McLaren, was a perfect mix of the Zombie's original tune, and it's played at a quintesential moment in the movie.  Perfectly timed, this remix is to drool over.  I also feel that Goodnight Moon by Shivaree is a fabulous find.  It may have only been played during the credits, but it was the tune that made me HAVE to buy this disk.<br />Like other reviewers, I sincerely hope that Tarantino releases the other songs played during the movie that didn't make Volume 1 or 2.  I would LOVE to buy the box set.  In the meanwhile, though, I'm going to bop along to the music I do have, because it's that damn good.  <br />Really, how can you go wrong with a soundtrack that includes Johnny Cash's A Satisfied Mind?<br />In my opinion, you can't.<br />Happy listening!
B00005ASHM|5.0|I was first introduced to Pet Sounds when i bought the album used at a cd store, i had heard all the hype about it, but i always stereotyped it as wierd kind of like a later beatles album.  At the time i was not into that kind of music, but damn how that changed as i got older.  The first time i listened to this whole cd from start to finish i was like is that it? what is all the hype about.  I didnt understand what all the fuss was about.  So i buried the cd in my cd rack and didn't even think about it for a few years.  As i got older i started getting in relationships and went through hard breakups and even fell in love.  During all these changes in my life i decided to polish off the old pet sounds and give it another chance.  and BANG, it opened pathways in my mind that i never knew existed.  What a beautiful album by Brian Wilson, i couldnt put how beautiful these sounds i was hearing were and i couldn't understand how much sense it made to me now as opposed to a few years earlier.  <BR>  I soon realized that the music was reflecting my life, and what is so cool is that this music was made in the mid sixties, and almost 40 years later it still have an impact on someones life like the way it did on mine.  One song that definitly stands out in my mind is &quot;God Only Knows&quot;  I can only hope that someday i have a wife that is also my best friend and i can play this song for them, because i do beleive it is the most beautiful lyrics i have ever heard.  And it is so simplistic.  &quot;wouldnt it be nice&quot; too is a beautiful dreamy song that im sure we all once experienced about being with someone you just think you could be with forever and you wish you didnt have to wait 8 or so years to finally be in that place.  I am so thankful that brian wilson created pet sounds because it has redefined and reshaped my whole perspective on life.  if you can tell, this cd is bigger then life for me, i hope this album can do something for you also.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|To be honest, I've had this album in some form or other for such a long time that I can't really objectively critique it. I will say it's probably Weezer's best work (Pinkerton is strong enough to warrant it's cult following, but has a few moments that bring it down for me), and holds up quite well for now being 10 years old. Not groundbreaking at all of course, but in my opinion still one of the best pop/rock album of the 90's. <br />The sound is noticably improved, but the real incentive for people who already own the album is the bonus disc. Admittedly most of it consists of b-sides, so if you're enough of a fan to have hunted all the singles down, it's a bit redundant, but if you haven't, it's a great addition thanks to strong should-have-been-on-the-album tracks like \\"Mykel And Carli\\" and especially \\"Jamie\\", and the acoustic stuff nicely shows off the band's melodic approach. The live cuts I'm not so sure about (sure it's nice to hear a pumped-up energetic \\"My Name Is Jonas\\", but \\"Surfwax America\\" is marred by some idiot shouting \\"Smoke dope!\\" over and over again over the quiet bridge). The outtakes are pretty interesting as well: In addition to a much shorter version of \\"Only In Dreams\\", a weird rough version of \\"Undone\\", there's also 3 previously unreleased songs. \\"I Swear It's True\\" is a little sloppy in performance and has filler lyrics, but shows potential and is surprisingly Pinkerton-esque for something that was written in 1993. \\"Paperface\\" is probably the loudest the band has ever gotten save \\"Tired Of Sex\\", very reminiscent of The Pixies circa Surfer Rosa, and finally there's \\"Lullabye For Wayne\\", which I can see didn't make the cut because it ultimately comes off like a less-good \\"Surfwax America\\", but is pretty catchy anyway. <br />Ultimately, this might be a bit much to pay for someone who hasn't heard the album itself (not to complain too much, but Pavement's recent Slanted And Enchanted deluxe version had much more extra material and yet generallycosts around the price you'd pay for one cd), but if your original copy is looking a bit ragged and/or you never got around to getting the b-sides, it's worth getting.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|In a nutshell, the new Maiden CD is not very good.  Yes there are some catchy songs and decent riffs, but overall the album is not anywhere up to Maiden standards.  I am a Maiden fan and have seen the 5x in concert and have never been dissappointed.  But this release needs to be picked up in the bargain bin.
0790731479|5.0|If I was told to name one movie that needs a DVD upgrade, it would have to be BEETLEJUICE. It's such a classic, it's hard to believe it's been so overlooked all these years. You know it came out on DVD before DVD's were released with a whole 2nd and sometimes 3rd disc devoted to special features. Also this DVD requires you to press menu in order to veiw it's very limited features, most DVD's start out on the menu and there is a \\"play movie\\" option. Not here, which isn't the worst that could happen I suppose. Even though this film has great sound mainly due to Danny Elfman's superb soundtrack, I would like a DTS soundtrack to enhance it. A director commentary is a must for a film like this. I hope I've made a point here, and I hope to see an upgrade sooner than soon. Don't you?
B000002J1U|5.0|Sure, Led Zeppelin could rock, that is undeniable.  I have never heard anyone nor will anyone ever be able to play like jimmy page did.  He was a God, and Robert Plant's voice was so spiritual and so hard to copy, he is in a league of his own.  Zeppelin's first two albums were so sexy and hard that when Zeppelin 3 came out, everyone was shocked to see a lighter side of of the boys.<BR>I think its very important to listen to this album a few times before really judging it, kind of like \\"Pet Sounds.\\"  This album is so haunting its unreal.  One time i drove to cleveland and listened to Zeppelin 3 over and over the whole way.  Just driving down the highway by yourself in the summer listening to songs like \\"Thats the way\\" and \\"Tangerine\\" is pure bliss in everyway.  songs like this make you really think about where your going in life, especially at my age of 19.  These songs are so beautiful and i do not think that Zeppelin could ever touch these types of songs there afterwards.  I am so thankful that Zeppelin took some time out of thier hard rocking days to put out something suggestive like this and lovely.  I will always consider zeppelin 3 as my favorite zeppelin album because it means so much to me and my direction in life and i will always be greatful for music like this.
0679311718|5.0|A most powerful book that will leave you speechless - at the horror, at the incomprehensibility of the Rwandan genocide, as well as at the travails and struggles of Dallaire's UN mission under tremendous odds. The author involves you by his day to day observations, you feel the daily grind of his army life as well as the unique frustrations placed on him by his UN superiors. Yes the Rwandan genocide could have been stopped had he had the manpower and means - how efficiently we will never know. But to have to stand by while people who expected help were butchered, while endless paperwork had to be filed, while the &quot;genocidaires&quot; went freely about their business thumbing their noses at UNAMIR - it becomes clear why many like Dallaire suffered intensely of PTSD - how can one erase the images? They wrench the soul.<br />Living in Rwanda and being able to associate places and names, listening to people - all of whom were touched by &quot;la guerre&quot; and who lost family -  brings the genocide even closer , although there are no more answers now than when Dallaire was there. I do not know how Rwandans can cope, living next door to returned killers whom they perhaps know personally. I do not know how they can look at the bones of those slaughtered and go on tilling the fields, doing their chores, smiling and hugging... But as one Rwandan said to me, what choice do we have but to forgive, we cannot hate for the rest of our lives (he lost his brother and family while he himself hid for three months and so managed to survive). Instead, he has turned his brother's  property into a restaurant, where there is music and dancing - he thought his brother would like such a memorial.<br />When Dallaire came to Rwanda for the ten year memorial celebration, he saw hope among the people again - may he be right. Plus jamais.
B000007T1M|5.0|undoubtedly awesome music right here. Their second and 3rd CD barely compare to the magnificence of this little prize.<BR>On an average, I play this cd 2 to 3 times per day. I head-bang till I see stars or play excessively violent videogames in teh process. Anyway, take this album and put it on top of your CDs (with the best cds highest on the rack) and feel the bliss that plunges into your mental core, as you listen to this metal roar.

B0000067L2|5.0|I bought this album at the record store a few years back, but the first time i was introduced to the sound of cream was during one of the greatest moments in cinematic history.  while watching the movie \\"Goodfellas\\" i was pretty much focused in on the movie, but when the awesomely haunting chords of \\"sunshine of your love\\" started to play and Deniro gives a dark stare in the bar, my whole life changed in a blink of an eye...i have never heard anything so mind blowing in any type of rock song, it was dark and sexy and i thought of cream as such a cool band.  This album is so unmerciful it is scary.  Clapton had ideas about music and what he was hearing in his head he wanted to share with the world.  the guitar sounds on this album sound like a more polished hendrix with more style and grace.  its too bad that cream did not stay together longer, because these guys could really play.  excellent choice for your cd rack.
B000002KKX|5.0|Out of nowhere in late 1979 came this great debut album from Christopher Cross which earned four grammys in 1980 including best album and best new artist. From the smooth rocking energy of the fantastic song and tribute to the great Little Feat singer Lowell George, &quot;Ride Like The Wind&quot; to the absolutely beautiful, tranquil classic, personal all-time favorite ballad &quot;Sailing&quot; (Best Song-Best Record - 1980), this album has the all ingredients to be hailed a classic.<br />Other great moments include the upbeat, memorable &quot;Say You'll Be Mine&quot; and gentle, flowing gem &quot;Never Be The Same&quot;. The smooth, consistent texture of this album continues with excellent pop savvy, relaxing ballads &quot;I Really Don't Care Anymore&quot;, &quot;Poor Shirley&quot; , &quot;Spinning&quot; , &quot;The Light Is On&quot; and the enjoyable closer, &quot;Minstrel Gigolo&quot;.       <br />Cross definitely had the extraordinary pop smarts and songwriting abilities to put this album together produced wonderfully by Michael Omartian as an all-star group of guest musicians appeared throughout that included notables Michael McDonald, Larry Carlton, Don Henley, Nicolette Larson, J.D. Souther and Eric Johnson.<br />A must have for any collection.....................
B000056NX5|5.0|This version is the best I have seen. It was inspiring and just plain amazing. Glenn Carter as Jesus was powerful beyond words and was supported by a very talented cast. Jerome Pradon was wonderful as Judas. Renee Castle is beautiful and a wonderful surprise by Tony Vincent as Simon Zealot. Surprise meaning that this young man has an extrordinary voice and I would have loved to have heard more of it.
B00005JMSE|3.0|The best review that I have read of this movie is that if you like comic books turned into movies then you will like this movie.  The best thing about this movie is that it has a sense of humur about itsself.  Other reviews have said that Ron Perlman is the one thing that saves the movie from mediocritry but I'm not sure that it's him so much as it is that the Hellboy character seems to be the only one in the movie with a sense of humur.<br />(...)
B00005JLYW|1.0|Hard to think of a worse \\"big name movie\\" than this one. Everything was bad. It has Matt LeBlanc in it. The stunts were in the kung fu mode, and worse than the Vin Diesel \\"XXX\\" crapfest, if that is possible. Falling off the dam into the helicopter was the first clue of up-coming dreck. The moto-cross action was way over the top. If you expected to see much female skin, forget it. Demi Moore has fake breasts - silicone valley. The \\"unrated\\" rating refers to the fact that it has more violence. Did I mention everything was bad? It has Matt LeBlanc in it.    I recommend watching any other movie except Lost and Delirious, Black and White, or Armageddon. People that make movies like this should be neutered and given a celluloid enema of their own film.
0385510438|4.0|\\"The Last Juror\\" is the latest novel out of the Grisham factory of legal thrillers.  This one is set back in Ford County, the setting of his first novel \\"A Time to Kill\\", but we also see Clanton, which I believe was the town from \\"The Chamber\\".  I have not been very impressed with Grisham's work when he has strayed away from the legal world, but this novel is a step back in that direction.  To be perfectly honest, Grisham puts one foot back into the legal matters that he has made his career on, but his other foot is in the day to day style of story he told in \\"A Painted House.\\"  This was an excellent blend of Grisham's two literary worlds.<br />The setting is 1970's Mississippi.  Willie Traynor.  Willie is a young reporter for the local newspaper, who, in an interesting set of circumstances, is able to buy the newspaper and become the new owner of the local paper.  For perhaps the first time in one of Grisham's legal novels, the protagonist is not someone who is directly connected to the law.  The future of the paper does not look good.  It was failing quickly (thus Willie was able to purchase the paper), and it doesn't look like Willie has much chance to significantly increase the number of readers...at least not until the brutal rape and murder (committed in front of the victim's children) with the suspect being part of a family with a deservedly poor reputation.  Willie begins reporting every aspect of the case and the trial (and does not hide his bias), sales of the paper begins to soar.<br />We are taken through the trial (and years later when what happened becomes an issue again) through the eyes of Willie Traynor.  Willie began as an outsider to Clanton, but as time passes he becomes an accepted (if colorful) member of Ford County.<br />I have always liked Grisham's legal books, and this one is no different.  While Grisham may never be nominated for the highest literary awards, his books are fast paced and entertaining and fun to read.  That's important, to read something that you enjoy, and I have enjoyed nearly ever book Grisham has put out.  They are similar and follow a formula, but Grisham is good enough (and is maturing as a writer) that for the brief amount of time that it takes to read his book, we are brought into Grisham's world., to read something that you enjoy, and I have enjoyed nearly ever book Grisham has put out.

B0001DI0FI|2.0|There's nothing particularly *wrong* with Master and Commander, but there's nothing particularly compelling about it either.  For a movie that has received as much hype as this one, potential purchasers of the DVD should understand that they'll get a sturdy sea warfare film that provides a bit of a diversion, but not much else.  There are no surprises here, nothing to really pick out of the pleasant background that unspools as the film progresses.  The characters are forced and hackneyed -- the little kid with grit, the secret pacifist warrior who also has his sensitive and artistic side.  And technically the movie is quite competent, managing to do a convincing job of re-creating a period look.  But there's something about the way the actors work within that carefully crafted period look that undermines it, and once the viewer starts to focus on the fact that \\"that's Russell Crowe up there,\\" the remainder of the film becomes an endurance contest.  You know how they say good actors disappear into the character?  Crowe, who has been great before (e.g. The Insider) and good before (Gladiator, A Beatiful Mind) simply has nowhere to go with this badly written character and inartfully written dialog.<br />I personally suggest that people looking for more compelling sea adventures check out the amazing \\"The Bounty\\" with Messrs. Hopkins and Gibson squaring off, or Robert Shaw in \\"Swashbuckler,\\" or even Pirates of the Carribean.  Even the sea scenes in \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" with Jim Cavaziel work better.  Heck, I'd even suggest \\"Cabin Boy.\\"  It's not that this film is terrible, it's just that there's no particular reason to go out of one's way to see it.
6304457383|5.0|I was extremely impressed with this movie. As I am a blind individual myself, I truly appreciated that this was not one of those ridiculous movies which dealt specifically with how blind people function in the world, but instead presented a realistic portrait of a woman fighting to survive. <BR>Audrey Hepburn realistically portrays Susie Hendrix, a woman who has recently lost her sight due to a car accident. She still struggles to adjust to her new lifestyle with the help of her husband Sam. My only complaint  of the movie is Sam's often harsh treatment of his wife. I realize that it necessary, but considering that this was a recent loss of eyesight, he possibly could have been more patient.<BR>The main premise of this film concerns a villainous drug dealer, Harry Rote (portrayed by Alan Arkin.) <BR>Alan Arkin is superb in his role. He is the most effective villain I have ever seen portrayed. Rote enlists the help of two recently released conmen to retrieve a heroin-filled doll from Susie's home, where it accidentially was taken by Sam. The ensuing struggle is between Susie and the three men, who attempt to deceive her in to handing over the doll. The climax of this film is extremely suspenseful and scary. Another quick note: Julie Herrod, who portrays Gloria, a young girl who assists Susie is extremely good.<BR>This film is truly worth your time, not only because it is suspenseful, but because it tells of the importance of overcoming obstacles in order to help yourself and others around you.
B00005JN1L|4.0|The theme is simple and quite common with Stephen King. He has often used it. A writer becomes suddenly due to some tension in his own life haunted by a doppelganger, his deeper self that he creates like a character in a story and the writer’s life becomes a story, a perfect story. The doppelganger does all the writer wants to do, wants him to do for him. It’s difficult to tell more without spoiling the story.<br /><br />You will recognize Stephen King’s artful suspense when everything looks exactly like it is supposed to look and yet is just a surface that has nothing to do with reality but reality is invisible because it is all inside and when the iceberg tips out of the water it is all so well done no one can see this tip of the iceberg, let alone the iceberg.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is perfect for the job because he can be both extremely disrupted, corrugated or just insane and at the same time, or just a second later, perfectly sane, charming and adorable. He just needs to change glasses or change hats or change his smile because he always smiles from grinning to grimacing via all kinds of lovable smirks. All extremes seem natural to this man who can just shift from one to the other in less than one nanosecond.<br /><br />But altogether and in the end what does this short story turned long feature tell us about the world and life? Not much really except that writers are always living in a crazy world of their own and no one can understand that. They are unbearable in real life. They can have some nice moments but most of the time they live in their phantasms. And you cannot enter their minds. Luckily you can’t and don’t tell me you would like to. All that leads to dirty divorce procedures and eventually suits. Before the divorce all that leads to having lovers and intimate friends, making the writer jealous, in a way to both escape him and provoke him out of his writer’s mind.<br /><br />At the very same time when you are dealing with a real writer who has a genial doppelganger, both genie and genius, the police will be helpless for at least some long, long time, because the police with all their crime scene investigation and their forensics cannot sort out the mind of an author who is not a serial killer and thus cannot be profiled. In fact his crimes are the only way he has to be reborn in a new life and there will be no series in that bloody episode.<br /><br />You should like it if you let yourself go into the story as if it were true, real, life incarnate. And Johnny Depp should be able to make you believe you have entered a completely true and real world. The phantasms are only the cherry on top of the pie and the ice cream for it to be &agrave; la mode.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUe and genius, the police will be helpless for at least some long, long time, because the police with all their crime scene investigation and their forensics cannot sort out the mind of an author who is not a serial killer and thus cannot be profiled.

B000053VAF|3.0|Downsides: Kind of noticeably low budget, and affleck &amp; damon are particularly bad in this movie.<br />Upsides: (1) The plot, as it's presented, isn't totally horrible (yes, that sounds slightly bad, because it kind of is in an absolute sense, but relative to affleck &amp; damon's acting it's actually an upside for this movie), and (2) bethany, jay, silent bob, &amp; the 13th apostle actually are pretty darn good.

B0000029GA|5.0|This is the definition of what hip hop was meant to be. This is a tomb attesting to life. It also has messages unlike most of today's acts. When you can listen to a CD 10years later and still be taken back...you know your dealing with a true work of art.

B0000640VO|5.0|...And just about everyone else, too. Whatever baggage you may or may not have concerning foreign films- drop it now. Amelie is perhaps the most exuberant, stylish and joyful film to pop along in ages. Lovingly made: the acting, the shot composition, the editing and the (very, very) subtle use of CGI...<br /><br /> Widescreen is a must for this one, as much of the film's beauty is chopped out in the VHS release (such as one scene, where Amelie is sitting in front of the TV in a room that's nigh entirely red- save for a small blue lamp to her left. It's a tiny detail, but it fleshes out everything wonderfully- closed captioned: the lamp is gone). Little things, definitely. But then, this is a movie that is all about the tiny details in life...<br /><br />Yes, it's a love story, and as sweet as they come. No need to further belabor that aspect or give away any moments. But you will be surprised many times over. You will laugh at loud. And you will want to watch it again and again, especially with someone you can touch close by. And if you don't have someone- this movie may provide the much-needed impetus to go to France and start turning (not to mention skipping) stones (the shots of the city are marvellous).<br /><br />Then there's Audrey Tautou, whose expressive face is the axis of the movie. Amelie holds your gaze like a naissance de millennium Audrey Hepburn. She has an elfin grace that is utterly sublime and unique. When Amelie smiles, you smile with her.<br /><br />I could gush about this for a long, long time. Rarely do I see a film that brings out the child-like optimist and romantic in me- I tend to go for the unflinching, unredemptive view of humanity (Requiem for a dream and Happiness are two good examples).<br /><br />If you have seen it, then you know why you should get this one- movies like this simply aren't made that often. Especially with such skill and flair (this was, I believe, Jeunet's first film sans Caro ((they did 'the city of lost children' and 'delicatessen,' both great films!)) and the cinematographer's first feature period, though I may be mistaken...)<br /><br />If you haven't seen it- trust a stranger.

0671015206|5.0|This book will make the thrifty feel blessed.  When a $100,000 BMW zooms by, they will think: &quot;I wonder if he can really afford it?

B000059HB7|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of John Wayne's best.....the character development just builds and builds throughout the movie until a thrilling climax. <BR>The all-time show stopper in this movie has to be Stumpy (Walter Brennan)...every scene in which he is involved, the scene is essentially stolen from the other players (re-watch and you will see). He is at his best when whining about being stuck in the jail yet always is cowed eventually into doing exactly what Chance (Wayne) wants him to do....except at the end of the movie when he unexpectedly shows up and helps the good guys (hence, the title of this review)! <br />This is just a fun and feel-good movie pitting good vs. evil and along the way throws in a little humor for relief. This is the first of the trilogy by this director and is the best of the three...but El Dorado is not far behind and Rio Lobo is not anywhere near as bad as it has been depicted. I have all three and when I am needing a John Wayne fix, I can't go wrong with one of these.
B0000D14JV|5.0|I just got &quot;Fready Friday&quot; today and I watched it as soon as I got home, and when I finished watching it I said I love this movie!!! This movie is now one of my favorite movies!! My favorite part in the movie is when they run into each other really hard and fall to the floor haha. And the cool part in the movie is when Anna's band performs! Well, I don't wanna give away the whole movie so my advice is go out today or whenever and BUYYYYYY ITTTT!!!! IT ROCKS!!!! It'll rock on for the rest of your life! :o) :o)
B000002H8F|5.0|My favorite band throughout all of high school broke up when i was in 9th grade. It's ok though, cuz I dropped out before completing 10th. This is they: The Pixies.<br />Ecce Pixies. The first time I heard this (I had bought it earlier that day, in the cheap bin at the Aiken mall on cassette) I listened to it the whole thing, over and over, on the long greyhound ride from SC to WV, going home for Thanksgiving break, 1992... I was one week shy of 14.<br />It's odd- Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa are both visceral angry, snarling little albums- you can hear the progression, but they both sound similar. Same for Doolittle and Trompe le Monde- both are poppy, punky, surrealistic little goldmines with songs about topics as diverse as Roswell, Samson being blind and pulling down the temple pillars (Gouge Away), how we bringing the apocalypse down on or heads, love and gun-running on a panamanian schooner...<br />BUT. Bossanove sounds like nothing else The Pixies ever did. And that's why it's my fave (She's my fave, undressing in the sun...). It's an ethereal, black-as-night, grim but gorgeous album full of reckless punk screaming and the rambling lyrics of Black Francis, Ms. Deal's badass bassery, Dave's fine drumming and the ever-inimitable Mr. santiago's piercing guitar lines. This is the album that made me want to learn surf guitar (before all you cheap copsters with your pulp fiction soundtracks crashed the gates, he he).<br />Velouria, The Happening, Ana (my favorite song by them- a gentle and soft spanish masterpiece that stands out utterly in their corpus, sounds like waves breaking on blue sand at sunset), Cecilia Anne, Allison... This is an album that you can put on and enjoy. Oh, and it works really well if you put it on while waatching Disney's 'Alice in Wonderland,' indulge in some minor league organic substance abuse, turn the tv volume down and- ENJOY.

B0001WTUH6|5.0|Want to see a story reminicent of Anita Blake's adventures?  This is your film.  The animosities of the characters and the story itself strongly remind me of the first time I read \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" and while it isn't her story, I believe Ms. Hamilton would be proud to be able to call these characters her own.  If your one of her starstruck fans, like me, who wish her works would be brought to the silver screen:  this is your film.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I Liked this movie it just was a little dull! It starts off where Reloaded ended. I dont have to say much about this movie its pretty much the same thing as the second one: they try to stop the machines and let there city have peace. The audio is good in a 5.1 dolby digital sourround sound mode. There is a Dual-layer format.The Edition I have is in a 2.35:1 Widescreen aspect ratio but there is also a Fullsceen Edition. The Special Features are cool coming with Trailers, Making Of Featurettes, and a making of the new Online Matrix game. As you can see its a pretty average DVD but its a good movie. Enjoy!

B0001AP12G|4.0|When everyone is talking about one CD you know there must be something good on it. I checked out Kanye West on The College Dropout because it has been the main talk in the hip-hop/r&amp;b community for over 2 months now. The disc is really heavy on the racial negativity but it still comes off as a classic in the end. Kanye West has the type of cocky flow on &quot;Two Words&quot; that makes you expect the worse but over the whole CD there are several good tracks. Talib Kweli and Mos Def help out here, no big suprises, but Common and J-Ivy are pretty hard to reach as well as GLC, Consequence, Freeway, Jay-Z, Twista, Jamie Foxxx and Ludacris. Overall, 4 stars due to the UNNECESSARY skits and the HORRIBLE filler songs &quot;school spirit&quot; and &quot;get 'em high&quot;.
B000002OZY|5.0|The first Who cd i bought was the Millennium Collection. I became obsessed with it and then I read the reviews. It made me realize that this timeless band was MUCH better even than I thought it was. Tommy is WOTHOUT A DOUBT a masterpeice. Some people think that a rock-opera is a silly idea. These people are ignorant and have no paitence, and most definitely have no taste in music. But I'm reviewing the actual album, right? OK.<br />Tommy is an album composed by Pete Townsend (*John Entwistle wrote &quot;Fiddle About&quot; and &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot;). in the late 60s. It was released in mid-1969. Tommy is a story about a deaf, dumb, and blind boy who &quot;sure plays a mean pinball.&quot; Tommy's father dies in battle before he is born, and his Mother tries to raise him. She meets another man and they wed. WHat happens next is the beginning of Tommy's journey that you will have to figure out for yourself. <br />Now, my biggest reccommendation to you besides buying the album is listening to it all the way through. If you don't the story literally means nothing and the songs seem very out of place. Do yourself a favor. Listen to it all the way through 2 or 3 times before you start skipping around to your favorite songs. You will thank me later, trust me. There are many tracks, but some are very short. Also, people who just try to pick out favorites completely overlook the less famous, but equally fantasic songs like 'Sally Simpson,' 'I'm Free,' The Acid Queen,' 'Cousin Kevin,' among others.  <br />All in all, Tommy is a very highly recommended album, especially for every rock fan's library. Don't be fooled by the genre; &quot;Rock-Opera.&quot; It is much more like a rock album. also, don't listen to people who say you should by all of their singles albums before you buy the concept albums (Tommy, Quadrophenia, and the debatable Who's Next). This is not true. Don't let Tommy be the first Who album you listen to, because it will be a lot to handle, and try to get a Whocompilation first, but Tommy is a great intro. to their albums. The ultra-cheap Millennium Collection will do just fine for the compilation. <BR>Happy listening!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I've said in other reviews i've done, Drew Barrymore is my all-time favorite actress. She portrays a sweetness and honesty to her characters. She does great in Romantic movies and this is my favorite romance movie she's done even though I also love Mad Love, The Wedding Singer, and Never Been Kissed. This is my all-time favorite version of Cinderella I think it's one of the few times where a different version than the original was 10 times better. My fasination with the story of Cinderella really started with this there is so much they did that made the movie better than the original did not.<br />  Drew Barrymore plays Danielle Debaberake (sp?) AKA Cinderella. Her mother died when she was a baby and for 8 years it was just her loving father and her. That is until he remarried and suddenly Danielle is left to get used to having a stepmother and two stepsisters around her age. Well 5 min. within the movie her her father dies and her stepmother makes her a servant and constantly verbally abuses her. When Cinderella is 18 is when Drew comes into the picture and she plays a very independent wise spunky and beautiful Cinderella. <br /> Anjelica Houston is priceless as the wicked stepmother and adds so much to the sterotype character. Anjelica while playing a mean and self-centered stepmother also adds a tiny touch of tenderness and feelings to the character the main scene you can see this is when Danielle is brushing her hair and the stepmother talks to her. Anjelica is such a classy graceful actress and I can't imagine anyone playing the stepmother better. She is almost worth watching this movie by herself.<br />Dougory Scott plays the prince of france Henry he is very easy on the eyes and is believeable as a prince. The prince is unintentionaly arrogant and at the first of the movie comes off as a little jerky. But that all changes when he meets Danielle. Her stepmother sold one of her fathers long-time servants to the americas when she couldn't pay her taxes and Danielle puts on a nice dress and does her hair and pretends to be part of the court in order to get him released. This is where she meets the prince who is automaticaly and obviously smitten and dumbfounded by her spirit and the fact she's the only &quot;courteer&quot; that has told him like it is and hasn't sucked up to him. Watching the two bump heads at their first few meetings as he at first always comes off jerky to her but the two are still smitten with each other is quite amusing to watch. <br />Her stepsister Margeritte (sp?) is blonde beautiful and bitc*y. She is constantly favored and spoiled by her mother and has her eyes on the prince simply because he's a prince. She ridiculously flirts with him everytime they are together and despite her great amount of effort it's obvious to the viewer that she'll never match up to Danielle. Margerette and her mother is still willing to &quot;take care&quot; of any competition that comes along and spends most of the movie scheming on how to get the princes affections.<br />I love how they made one of the stepsister's nice. Jacalenne is Danielles other stepsister who is actually very sweet softspoken and sympathetic to cinderella but at the sametime wants to please her mother. She is also verbally abused by her mother and is only a level up from Danielle in her mother's point of view. Even her dress is only a slight fancier than Danielle's. Every scene she's in she brings sweetness and innocence. <br />Also unlike the original, the prince and Danielle met long before the &quot;ball&quot; and so they already built affection before then. When she opens up her heart to &quot;Henry&quot; she starts standing up to her stepmother and to Margerette. When I first saw this, this made the movie for me. I myself am a very fiesty &quot;no crap&quot; woman and I found myself getting totally frustrated when someone is mistreated and they just stand there and take it. I kept saying &quot;IF THAT WAS ME I WOULD OF TOLD THEM WHERE TO GO&quot; so when she starts mouthing off back to them I thought &quot;you go girl it's about damn time&quot; one of the most satisfying scenes is when she socks Margerette in the eye. I found myself wishing she could of gotten in a couple more hits because like I said throughout the movie Margerette is a complete bit**. <br />This movie is funny, touching, romantic, dramatic, and just overall entertaining. Everyone in this movie holds their place and whoever cast this movie knows what they are doing cause I can't imagine anyone of these roles being played by anyone else better.<br />This is a great movie for anyone but I do think girls will appreciate it more because of all the romance and the &quot;independent woman&quot; vibe cinderella holds.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is just incredibly good. it is by far the best album i own and i just dont understand what the deal is with people hating kurt cobain. he was a lyrical genius, and anyone who disagrees is either to ignorant or to tainted by other music to see the beauty in the lyrics. I classify nirvana with the beatles, and not because of cobains &quot;similarity&quot; to john lennon. I wouldn't compare the two, because they are both great on different levels and in different ways. And or people who complain of kurts guitar playing, nirvana wasn't about guitar playing, they were about mind shattering lyrics, and they guitar sounds good wih them. besides that, dave grohl's drumming and krist novoselic's bass make up for any musical deficincies with the guitar. People shouldn't compare kurt cobain to jimi hendrix. Hendrix(who i am also a big fan of), was about his guitar work, and kurt was about his lyrics. anyone who compares kurt cobain to other musicians is just shooting don other peoples respect and joy of nirvana. you should just leave kurt alone. may his troubled soul rest in peace.
B000001FFR|5.0|I've got this album in addition to Among The Living and We've Come for You All.Maybe I'm showing my age,but I much prefer 80's metal to nu metal.That said,I like STD better than Among,which most people seem to think is Anthrax's masterpiece.Don't get me wrong,Among is one of the best.But as someone who loves both,if Among is a 10,then STD is a 10.5!I think the album is solid from beginning to end,where as Among slows down a little bit here and there.STD is 80's thrash/heavy metal at it's best!
B000050FEN|5.0|. . . and much more of a character study, 'Se7en' is the perfect vehicle for the arrival of director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker.  What makes this film great is director David Fincher's attention to detail, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker's ability to turn the buddy/cop drama on it's head, and Oscar-calibre performances by Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, and especially Morgan Freeman. <br />SPOILERS:<BR>Great script.  As you probably already know, the serial killer (whose real name IS \\"John Doe\\"), causes the deaths of several individuals who are most obviously guilty of the mortal sins - gluttony (a morbidly obese man is forced to eat himself to death), greed (a slimy criminal lawyer is forced to remove \\"a pound a flesh\\"), sloth (a pedophile, drug dealer/addict is tied to his bed to waste away for a year before he is found), pride (a model who is so ugly on the inside that she decides to kill herself rather than be ugly on the outside), and lust (a married john is forced to \\"drill\\" a prostitute).   More subtly, however, Walker creates a parallel between two seemingly opposite characters - Detective Sommerset (who is retiring out of a sense resignation toward the sick world we live in) and \\"John Doe\\" (who is committing the serial murders more as punctuation marks in a message to the world the only way he know to make it listen - with a \\"sledgehammer\\").  Narratively speaking, as Detective Sommerset is going out the revolving door, the young Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is coming in.  Although the angry, vengeful cop has been overplayed as the hero in countless numbers of genre films since 'Dirty Harry', Walker brilliantly shines a light on that character's own mortal sin - wrath - as being no more or less worth of attrition than the sins of the criminals that such cops usually vanquish in these films.  Of course, John Doe (Kevin Spacey in a sparse, but no less effective, role) saves attrition for the final sin for himself - an individual who honestly envies the ignorant bliss of the common man.  What is most refreshing about this script is that the \\"bad guy\\" runs the narrative - the cops never have control.<br />Great directing.  Motivated by a disappointing directorial experience ('Alien 3'), Fincher pulls no punches to make 'Seven' noir to the extreme.   Even the most casual viewer will note that until the end of the film, it is contiuously raining.  In terms of overall effect, the attention to detail is, quite simply, outstanding.<br />Great acting.  Morgan Freeman was so compelling as the philosophical, but jaded detective that he would create his own typcast ('Kiss the Girls', 'Along Came a Spider').  Brad Pitt may not have been stretching too much as the angry young man, but the final scene where the phases of anger and sadness watch over his face is one of the greatest moments he has ever put to film.  Finally, you cannot say enough about Kevin Spacey, whose appearance in the last quarter of the film is a minimal one, but no less powerful than Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter.
B0001LYH9S|4.0|by the mid 90's, David Bowie was at a crossroads.  It'd been nearly a decade since his last success, and while his last album, Black Tie White Noise,  was good, it quickly went out of print thanks to the label closing it's doors less than 2 months after it's release.   Enter the mid-90's alternative era.  Nirvana scored a hit with their Unplugged cover of The Man Who Sold The World, and Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor became a superstar making music that was very Bowie influenced, especially from Bowie's late 70's Berlin trilogy with Brian Eno.     <br />Bowie and Trent quickly became friends, and subsequently went on tour to promote this album.  Taking note at how Low/Heroes/Lodger was influencing a whole generation of new musicians, Bowie hooked up with Brian Eno and recorded what was to be the first of a trilogy.   Outside was released in September 1995 with plenty of hype.  MTV, which hadn't played Bowie since the Never Let Me Down video, played &quot;The Heart's Filthy Lesson&quot; in heavy rotation for a month before the album hit.   That song may very well be not only the best song on the album, but David's best song of the entire 1990's.<br />In many ways, Outside is spotty.  The story of the kidnapping of Baby Grace still makes very little sense 9 years on.    However, it showed that Bowie was back in full swing again and he quickly reclaimed his place in music.    While the seeds of Bowie's return to relevance (which has lasted through today) were planted with Black Tie White Noise,  it blossomed with Outside.<br />Columbia (Virgin released the album in 1995, and it went out of print a year or two ago) reissued Outside in March 2004, and added Get Real, a track that appeared on the Japanese pressing of the album and the single for Strangers When We Meet.   Try it out,  not Bowie's best by a long shot, but one of his most interesting works.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|...and yet it is fantastic. Trying to pull a single worth radio circulation (like that shouls be a guage of any kind) from this album is difficult, because no song jumps out at you as a traditional single. But this album is just all-around solid work. I was looking for something as hooky and addictive as the first album, and they deliver throughout. My wife put it in her car's 6-cd rotation the week it hit the stores, and its still there. Good stuff, maynard.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Let me start by saying I would never in all my life have imagined buying a Britney Spears CD. <BR>I liked Me against the music but I wasn't going to put aside thirteen dollars for that. Then came the highly infectious 'Toxic' and it took me quite a long time before &quot;Britney sang this one&quot; sank into my head. It's not that I've never liked her music. I was a fan of 'I'm a Slave 4 u' and a couple of ballads and the single - 'Stronger'. But I was still convinced that she was talentless and sang like a duck. <BR>About a month and a half ago, I made sure none of my friends were watching me as i sneaked into a music store and picked up 'In the Zone'. Owning a Britney CD is a big disgrace according to all my friends.<BR>I was quite taken aback when I listened to the CD.<BR>Her voice is the worst part of the CD but I think she does have some vocal abilty (Shadow and Everytime prove this). This is a very creative album. The lyrics are better than her previous ones though not extraordinary in any way. They are more open and some of them are not for below 13/14. <BR>She's come up with some great tunes this time and her team has come up with great beats to give us a very enjoyable CD. It deserves a chance.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|As a recent convert to all things Coldplay, I was hoping for more insight into the band beyond what I've heard on the album. What I got was a great live performance, with a couple new songs -- but it did not rise above. Don't get me wrong - I love the album - but I expect to hear a different side of the band on a live album. And I want to hear MORE of them. 40 minutes of audio? C'mon people, throw us a bone? Love the music, just want more of it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy is a masterpiece. At the very least, Star Wars: A New Hope and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back are both in the top 10 films of all time. However, you must realize something when you buy this boxset. These versions are not the original theatrical versions of 1977, 1980, and 1983. They are a modification of the Special Edition versions from 1997 and the only versions in there. Now I'm not telling you to boycott this disc, that is silly when you are looking at masterpieces of this sort, even in the SE form. But, if you want your disspleasure heard, you should sign a petion like at OriginalTrilogy and/or start to email Lucasfilm, etc...I thought that worth mentioning, but anyway back to the main point. The special features are awesome, audio commentary, 10 hours+ bonus features. But ask yourself, do I want only the Special Edition versions on DVD and later formats for all time? Or do I want the original theatrical versions as well? And with that I leave the classic words, May the Force Be With You.
B00005JKN9|4.0|If you like Leonardo Dicaprio, you cannot miss this movie,  cause in this one, Dicaprio's acting skill is just amazing.<br />Never forget the end of this movie, very cool, and never seen in any movie before^^
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This incredibly beautiful and spiritual soundtrack evokes all the feelings a Christian should feel, and which I have NEVER in my life felt more deeply or completely until hearing this! The suffering of Jesus, His complete surrender to suffering and dying so that all mankind can live eternally is brought home to me so clearly when I listen to this hypnotic music. John Debney is a very gifted artist, and God is speaking to all of us with this haunting production.
0671027344|5.0|Perks of Being A Wallflower was an amazing book. Not many a book can make me cry, feel like I'm actually there, CARE for the characters as I would a friend. It was all together amazing. I don't see how ANYONE could think it overrated (Patrick Santana). Maybe the kid had good role models for those sorts of things. It's very believeable. And just so amazing. One of the few books I plan on reading again. Personally, I thought it was a lot better than Catcher in The Rye, but then again I didn't care very much for Catcher. Perks of Being A Wallflower helped me to not understand per se, but get a better feeling about guys in their High School and whatnot. I would recommend this book to any and everyone. It was seriously mind-blowingly good. The writing is superb, as was the word choice and had lovely organization. OH IT  WAS JUST GREAT!
B0000024IE|5.0|Simply one of the best rap record of all time ! If you simply like music, jazz, rock, whatever... Youy will love this record !<BR>A must for all music fans in general ! And it's got a lot of ATTITUDE !!!
B000002U82|5.0|From listening to this storming through Scotland in a 1973 Triumph Dolomite to blasting it out of my latest THX 5.1 system in California this has always been the greatest album of all. 886 review before me and it's still nearly a 5, well the ones that didn't give it a five probably just slipped on reviewed the wrong album. This is one of the few albums that has really stood the test of time, in the charts for most of my life and still there now.

B0001BKAEY|3.0|I had been looking forward to the release of Matrix Revolutions having missed it in the theater. I enjoyed the first Matrix with its intriguing &quot;what if&quot; style plot and non-stop action.<br />Matrix reloaded departed a bit from that formula tending towards the metaphysical, psuedo-philosophical, &quot;greater mystery&quot; and profound trutch model, yet still keeping the style and mystery of the original.<br />Revolutions however trumped both in the action arena. It was in  many ways the ultimate man-versus-machine scenario.<br />What ruined it for me was the all nonsense masquerading as deep philosophy and all that shallow meaning of life crap.<br />The movie took itself way too seriously and I found it pretensious and not a little tedious. It looks to me like it played with intention of being difficult to understand as a substitute for depth. In reality if it was hard for some people to fathom it was because none of it made much sense.<br />If you filter out all the nonsense though and perhaps cut 30-40 minutes of claptrap out of it the movie would have been much better. Like when some fans cut many of the Jar-Jar Binks scenes from Star Wars I and made it a better tighter film.<br />If more of the Matrix had been left on the cutting room floor I think this movie would have been much better.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Not yet. <br />Actually Matrix and Equilibrium are like apple and orange, you can not compare them. I am not sure why it say &quot;better than matrix&quot;. The idea of this movie is about human emontion. Everyone takes drug to suppress the emontion in order to prevent war. It reminds me about Communism. There is theory and there is reality. We all know many problem about humanity, but it is not easy to change because this is just the nature of us. Why ? Only the God can answer it.<br />In this movie, I really like the gun fight, it is new to see and very creative.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I'm not going to waste precious time by telling people what I think about the original Blue Album. It's excellent, one of the best albums of all time hands down.  A personal favorite done by one my favorite band. The remastering is excellent and it was a joy to listen to it even for the millionth time. But that's not what made me want to repurchase an album I already own. I did it all for disc 2. FINALLY a b-side collection, imagine my elation!<BR>   It's just awesome, all your favorites Susanne, Jamie, Evaline, Mykel and Carli and new stuff that I'd never heard at least. I can hear why the b-sides &quot;Paperface&quot;, &quot;Lullabye&quot;, and &quot;I Swear It's True&quot; are in fact b-sides. They have a different feeling, a more edgey rock feel. Don't get me wrong, they're awesome tracks, I especially love &quot;Paperface&quot; but I can see why perhaps they were skipped over for the orginal Blue Album.  I'm just glad they put them on this disc so we could hear them<BR>    The inclusion of the Kitchen Tapes was just an awesome idea. Those tracks blew me away, especially the acoustic &quot;Sweater Song&quot;. I loved every minute of this CD. I've listened to it countless times since I've purchased it and it's great. If you have the Blue Album already, buy this.  If you don't already have the Blue Album, you shall be stoned, then buy this album. Pay the money and support a band that puts out quality rock music.
0375804013|5.0|Kids love it.  They think it's hysterical.  Anytime you find a book that they love, it's a good thing.  Two thumbs up!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Okay, now to put in my two cents, for those people who gave this movie 5 stars have got to be 13 and new to movies, for anyone who actually isnt living in japan and isnt 13 would agree with me here, this movie reaks. We've been flooded with so many bad movies where blind to what actual good movies are. people with common sense and taste are a dying breed and its sad, just like this movie (heh). They shouldve just kept it with one movie and no sequals, alas joel silver needed more money.
B0000D96NW|3.0|Don't believe the hype. This ain't Burn My Eyes. Imperium is, but the rest of the album isn't. Machine Head is a great band with unbelievable potential, but most of this album is the same old same old from the last couple of albums. Demmel should have pulled out and finished the new Vio-lence. Now THAT would be real old school thrash.
0066620996|5.0|This book is a fascinating read!  A study taken over five years began with twenty-eight corporations and revealed eleven that had made the leap from Good to Great.  From this study, I gained an instant understanding of the role of humility in leadership.  The primary ambition of great leaders is focused on the success of their company, not on themselves. <br />Collins advocates the Hedgehog Concept - a combination of discovering what you can be best in the world at (Optimal Thinking), what you are passionate about, and what drives your economic engine.  Collins states that sustained disciplined action is primarily achieved by &quot;fanatical adherence to the Hedgehog Concept and the willingness to shun opportunities that fall outside the three circles.&quot;  So my question is:  How do you identify the best?   I recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self by Dr. Rosalene Glickman as an adjunct to this powerful book to provide the mental resource to identify the best, optimize emotional and financial intelligence and create a corporate culture of optimization.  From Good to Greatest to Best!&quot;
B00000J1YS|5.0|By far the best Straits album. and thats saying alot because all the albums were great with the exeption of communique wich was OK.The first time i heard telegraph  road i waws in awe. Its one of the best songs i have ever heard. It just tells a fantastic story. Private Investigations is different but still very good. Knopfler does not really sing this song he mainly talks it but the lyrics are great and its just kind of creapy. Industrial Disease is also different but still very good, and is probably the worst song on the album.And Love over gold and It never rains are also amazing songs.There may only be 5 songs but they are five inspired and well written songs.A must have for any Dire straits Fan or any Mark knopfler fan.Get it.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I must say this collection is different and one of the<br />best in years. Inventive/spare/out there.  Great songs<br />and interesting touches make this a must have for your cd<br />collection. Look forward to his follow-up!

B00005JMEW|1.0|Now, don't get me wrong- I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I'm in awe of Tarantino, love the postmodern ironic/unironic constant appropriation that infuses this movie with style, panache, thrills, and giggles. It's a GREAT movie!<br />But, the DVD is TERRIBLE! A music video (not even a good one) of some wacky Japanese chicks (give me Shonen Knife anyday instead) and &quot;The Making of...&quot; is ALL you get for special features. And, And, AND,,,<br />IT'S CENSORED! How come only ONE of Sophie's arms are cut off? Where's the second? HOW MUCH IS MISSING FROM THIS DVD? WHY ARE WE BEING SOLD A RE-EDITED VERSION OF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE????<br />Why? To make more money, to justify a stupid &quot;director's cut&quot;. This is a rip-off, and I'm appalled that Tarantino, who claims to love cinema, should abuse us this badly.<br />Wait for the director's cut... don't buy this piece of trash DVD.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|This is another effort solo from Tony Banks, Keyboardist of Genesis, and his first on the classical world. A great record. This music travel around the emotional melody, a Bank's trade mark. But you can listen also some old Genesis melodies tunes, played marvelous by the Philharmonic London Orchestra, conduct by Mike Dixon. Tony Banks had this experience before with the release of Wicked Lady (1983). By that time, he did record some tunes by himself and It was played by an Orchestra with their own production. Seven is different. It got Tony's production, arrengment, composition and he also plays a classical piano. This is a fantastic jorney for a Rock and Roll Music fan and a must buy for the classical world.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Let's get one thing straight:  &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; has none of the reality-bending plot twists nor the eye-opening originality of the first.  The final chapter in the trilogy is an altogether different type of movie.  Although it cannot compete against the original, it competes strongly against other entries in the action/adventure genre.  With the requisite battle scenes that pit the underdog against a superpower, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; is a fast-paced, adrenalin-packed movie that owes its entertainment to action and special effects.  Despite this, the viewer must listen and watch carefully, as in the other two, to understand why events unfold as they do.<br />The plot is difficult to detail without spoilers since many of the most shocking revelations come at the beginning, before the high-stakes battle scenes begin.  Let it suffice to say that Neo has become something more than we thought, and as a result, he is much more of a threat to the nefarious virus Agent Smith.  When the Oracle indicates (or does she?) that Neo is Zion's only hope, he and Trinity break off from the others who are hunkering down for an all-out assault of Zion.  This is the strongest indicator that the third of the trilogy has stepped away from philosophical sci-fi and into pure action, as Neo and Trinity disappear from the screen for long stretches.  Their onscreen time is limited, as is their plot; this will disappoint many diehard fans.  Still, the action sequences are breathless (although eventually overdone) and the special effects are first-rate.  The resolution of the trilogy is both surprising and inevitable, the hallmark of a well-prepared story.  If you've been paying attention, it will make complete sense.<br />I recommend you approach this film without high expectations.  Comparing it to the first will only disappoint you.  Expect instead something along the lines of the &quot;Terminator&quot; movies, and you'll enjoy every minute.
6300214028|5.0|There is only one way of watching this film; it has to be watched as if one were reading a novel. What unfolds, however, is a love story told in terms of tense relationships. The story becomes increasingly absorbing with every passing minute.<br />Sublime!
B0000DZ3DR|5.0|Gene Clark was one of the century's greatest singer-songwriters.  That he enjoyed his most popular public success at an early age (with The Byrds) reminds me a lot of Orson Welles.  But, like Welles, he went on to do so much more.  His albums, after he left The Byrds, such as FANTASTIC EXPEDITION, WHITE LIGHT, NO OTHER, and TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY, took him to new heights of musical greatness.  This was the final album he recorded before his untimeley death at age 46.  It is a great album, in which he partnered with the very talented Carla Olson.  They made a great team.  Too bad he didn't live to make a second album.  As it is, this is a great CD, which includes a half dozen fine Clark-Olson tracks left off the original album.  Anybody who loves folk/rock/country should buy this CD.  Quite simply put, they are the best, period.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Just terrible.. If you feel good after watching this movie, you are crazy. Recently, some movies like this and \\"Lost in Translation\\" just exaggerate Japanese culture. As one of Japanese living in the U.S., I say \\"Please, please don't do that. It's not funny.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never really watched any other of Joss' work. I never watched Buffy or Angel. I never even watch this show when it was aired. I just asked my girlfriend to get me the boxset for my birthday, because I had read that some random guy on the internet,whose webpage I frequent, said it was good. I popped the first disc in. After the first episode, I was addicted. I then watched the show for a good 5 hours before finally deciding to go to sleep. This and 24 go on my list as the most addictive shows I have ever seen. The DVD boxset is superb. It is a pure tragedy that Fox cancelled this show. They dropped the ball on this one. So anyways, buy it. It's great, it's fantastic, it will keep you entertained for a weekend.
B00005JMEW|5.0|In my opinion this movie is great. Awesome soundtrack (there are some songs I don't like, however) combines with good acting and fight scenes to produce this masterpiece. There's lots of blood and violence in this movie, so its not for everyone, but I think it just adds to the quality of the movie. The plot is interesting and involving (especially as it unravels in Kill Bill Vol. 2) Recomended for everyone not offended by seeing people's arms, legs and feet cut off. :)
B00005JMEW|1.0|I wanted to get it.  I wanted to appreciate, heck, love this movie as much as most of the reviewers out there, but it just didn't happen.  This is the single emptiest, unsatisfying, pretentious, unredeeming pile of poser loaf in the history of cinema.      Now I AM a fan of Tarantino.  The first movie I put in when I finally got the big screen TV and surround sound was \\"Reservoir Dogs\\".  I dragged friends to see \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  For a while he was pretty impressive. He's lost it in this one.    I know, I know.  Everybody will point out  all the \\"homages\\" that Tarantino pays to the \\"great\\" martial arts action movies, and to the speghetti westerns, etc.  But when you blantantly steal a vibe or a scene, or even an outfit: pee on it, and make it meaningless, its not an homage, it's more like a desecration.  It's not creative and new, it's derivative and dead.  From the empty delivery of the intentionally hokey dialogue, to the cartoony wire-fu combat, to the puppety-looking sets and airline sequences, it plays more like a 60's batman episode.  For a few minutes I was almost ready to credit him with making a great action movie farce.  But it's too unmovingly violent, and too full of itself to even succeed as a satire.        Tarantino does use some editing techniques that in a better movie, might've made a positive difference.  Here they have just the opposite effect; using the directors mastery of technical detail to mock his inability to construct a story.  Flash-backs, flash-forwards, flash-animations all stroll through the plot, not because they need to to tell the story, but because, hey, he's Quentin T, and if he want to clown-punch his way through a cinematic sequence then that's what he's gonna do.    I guess the lesson here is that if you really want to, you can spend dozens of millions of dollars to make a crappy retread action movie when most production teams can do it for less than 8.     Gaudy, empty, emotionally uninvolving, repetitive, derivative, schlocky, masturbatorily violent, and ultimately ineffective.      If you buy the hype, then buy the movie.  My advice is to use your head and walk away.
B000002LND|2.0|If you like a trip to the eighties, then this is the album for you. That's all I can say about this album. Her earlier tracks sound much better than her recent output, almost sound monotonic.
B000002UJQ|2.0|Two stars at best from me. I have listened to this over and over (I was told I'd have to in order to like it), and still do not consider this the brilliant work of art it's been made out to be. While this album has it's moments, I would definitely not consider it worthy of all the praise it has recieved. If Radiohead are considered so hard to like and get into, then why is it that they are as insanely popular as they are? I'm thinking that just because all the critics love them, the wannabe hipsters will naturally follow. Buy this incredibly overrated album only if you know what you're getting into.
B00005N9CV|5.0|with what others have to say about this spectacular cd. Krall's voice is simply amazing, soothing, and relaxing. Forget Norah Jones, but this is what relaxing music is. Cry Me A River is as filled with so much emotion as one can ever imagine, after all, its my favourite track on the cd.
B000066NW0|1.0|The only good thing about Avril Lavigne is that one day, she (along with countless others) will go belly-up, just like Tiffany, NKOTB, Backstreet Boys, and the many others that have done so before her. But really, what can I say about Avril that hasn't been said millions of times before? We all know she's a talentless poser created by the industry to cash in on ridiculous fads, right? I predict her next album &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, will be her last. Truely, I cannot wait for the day that this madness will end. Avoid her like the plague!!!

B000002KD9|5.0|The song &quot;After the Goldrush&quot; was 1st introduced to my ears while listening to the radio in my dad's pickup truck when I was 9 years old.  Twelve years later my feelings for that album have not wavered.  I have seen reviews by Rolling Stone magazine that say that this album was released prematurely.  Upon reading Neil Young's biography and listening to many of his other albums, you will discover that whatever Neil releases is EXACTLY what he wants people to hear. <BR>After the Goldrush is an album with mixed emotions.  I am not a professional reviewer, but I know that the album brings out emotions of both reflection and love.  It's an album of great contrast as well. Some songs like &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;Cripple Creek Ferry&quot; are sort of light hearted and uplifting while the songs &quot;Don't Let It Bring You Down&quot; and  &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot;...I think the names speak for themselves.  <BR>Do yourself a favor and get this album.  You will never forget it.
B000001EAQ|4.0|This album was released in March 1997 and marked the four-yearly re-emergence of U2, who are undoubtedly still one of the leading rock bands in the world. Pop continued the group's 90's excursions into the glittery world of urban techno music, but still retained some of their trademark spine-tingling emotional highs. Critics at the time were unconvinced of its merits when comparing it with earlier, classic U2 albums, but I feel it is a strong album worthy of its place in the U2 back catalogue.   Despite the muted tones of several tracks such as the despairing Wake Up Dead Man, the quiet If You Wear That Velvet Dress and the languid The Playboy Mansion, this album is best remembered for the ironic disco pastiche of Discotheque - a cheeky drug reference or two spiced up this track, which also exists in the standard array of remix and single-edit versions.<BR>Bono imbues the brooding tune Please with escalating urgency as he addresses the prevaricating politicians stalling on the crucial Northern Ireland peace talks - it's as relevant now in 2004 as it was 7 years ago. Gone has a similar slow intro and escalating dramatic tension as it rises to a memorable chorus, while Miami is a cut-up urban groove that is reminiscent of the Zooropa album's  Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car. On a lighter note, there is the innocuous seasonal sentiment of If God Will Send His Angels, which doubled as a Christmas-themed CD single in December 1997, and the catchy shuffle of Do You Feel Loved, which is about the nearest thing to \\"pop\\" on this interesting record. The other singles were Staring At The Sun, a great tune that has a memorable chorus, and the dark, murky-sounding vibe of Last Night On Earth. I liked all these songs back in 1997, but the one truly fantastic, indispensible track is Mofo, which I listen to regularly to this day. This is an awesome recording, with one of the best killer riffs you will ever hear, a clattering techno beat, and and achingly-real sentiments fromBono as he sings of the never-ending pain of losing his mother to illness at an early age: \\"Trying to fill that God-shaped hole...\\" Buy Pop for this track alone and you won't be disappointed, and for any rock fans who don't already know this record, I suggest grab a copy and enjoy!
6304366027|5.0|This movie is a trully underated musical. The poor script and imprudent editing are its only flaws. But the performances, the direction, the story,the costuming, the art direction, cinematography and the music make those flaws virtually unoticable. Im sure if this had been the success it should have been back in 1977, Im sure the film, the art direction, the cinematography, the costuming, Scorcese, and above all else Minelli(who never looked or sounded better)and Deniro would all have gotten Oscar nods. The one that I truly cant beleive is that the title song didnt win the oscar. It has become such a standard it should have one. Overall a great film trully an underated classic.
B000001E18|4.0|Zooropa was the first U2 album I bought, in November 1993. It was the end of university and I treated myself to a trip to Melbourne to see the ZooTV show on the Australian leg of the tour. I was very surprised but pleased to hear how much U2's sound had changed since the classic era of 80's single hits like Pride, New Year's Day and With Or Without You. In place of the guitar-based classic rock and  the soulful yearning of their first decade, U2 had developed this dense, sophisticated, rhythmic and at-times chaotic music with much help from collaborators such as the inventive, pioneering Brian Eno. Zooropa grew out of the 2-year long ZooTV world tour and had startling cuts like the hard-to-categorise  Lemon , the impressive Stay(Faraway, So Close!) and the subversive Numb ( which featured Edge's monotone on lead vocals). A slow ballad called The First Time demonstrates the out-of-focus, unorthodox sound of these recordings very well; it's as if the clear, strident messages of their earlier records had been deliberately blurred and fogged to create a new artistic effect that invited different interpretations. New beats showed up in Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car, Some Days Are Better Than Others, and especially the creeping intensity of Dirty Day. There is only one heavy lyric here - the world-weary travelogue of The Wanderer , and U2 had none other than the late singing storyteller Johnny Cash to sing this one for them as the final track on Zooropa. After 10 years I am still a fan of this album, and enjoy the way that such a well-established act can reinvent itself so successfully. U2 took home a Grammy award for best &quot;alternative&quot; album in 1994 for Zooropa. Alternative to what? Well , to anything they'd done before. Good on them for that.

I'm so glad I  managed to avoid teen mainstream (i'm talkin  about GC NFG  and all those other  wannabes). This Cd is one of the best in my collection. I put right up there with \\"never mind the bollocks, heres the  Sex  Pistols\\", \\"...And out come the wolves\\" and \\"Energy\\". My Faveorate songs on this album are, \\"London Calling\\", \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" and \\"Koka Kola\\".

The 1st and 2nd symphonies have become some of my favorites, with their sparkling winds strong exhibition of classical strength.<br />Of course, this historic cycle collection is well known for its Unfinished and 9th renditions, which are just most dramatic and energized.<br />His 5th and 6th interpretations exhibit a relaxed pace that never grows old or hurries the listener.<br />This collector's edition from DG is good for those of us who likely won't buy other versions, and this is a solid set at a most remarkable value.

B00008OWZC|5.0|One day, my friend asked me, if you were stuck on a deserted island and could only bring one album, which would it be? Now, ME being a music freak, one would think I would have a hard time answering this question- but no. Quite simple. THIS ONE. <BR>This is the mother of all live albums. What makes it so freakin awesome? To start off, we're talking about Zeppelin here. LIVE ZEPPELIN. <BR>DISC 1:<BR>1/2. LA Drone/Immigrant Song: Blood pumping intro; listen to this one with your headphones at the loudest volume... it will make you shake with excitement. <BR>3. Heartbreaker: THIS is why Page is Godly. <BR>4. Black Dog: Perfect. Perfect. Plant knows how to work a crowd.<BR>5. Over the Hills and Far Away: At this time, Houses of the Holy wasn't released yet, so audiences got their first taste of the genius to come. This song IS genius, even better live. <BR>6. Since I've Been Loving You: Blues at their finest. Oh how I love these four men. <BR>7. Stairway to Heaven: The insane ballad with the double necked gibson. What else to say?  <BR>8. Going To California: This song makes me cry its so beautiful. Oooh yes. <BR>9. That's The Way: Please see \\"Going to California\\"<BR>10. Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp: This will get your feet stompin' and your blood rushin'. <br />DISC 2:<BR>1. Dazed and Confused: Are you intimidated by the length of this song? Don't be. [really] AMAZING. This is an even better example of why Jimmy is right up there with Hendrix. An excellent example of how the 4 members seem to be psychic. <br />2. What It Is and SHould Never Be: Perfect<BR>3. Dancing Days: \\"it's about summertime and good things\\" :) <BR>4. Moby Dick: GOD BLESS BONHAM'S SOUL. PLEASE. <br />DISC 3:<BR>1. Whole Lotta Love: Take an even farther step back in time when John Lee Hooker and Gene Pitney were writing rock n' roll. Zep will take you there. If I had to choose a favorite track on the album, this would probably be it. Only these guys can pull off what they do here. Only Zeppelin. <BR>2. Rock andRoll: classic tune with a live attitude. geez I sound like a salesperson. Let me change that: A classic tune with a live attitude :: wink and smile with a tooth sparkling ::<BR>really fun.<BR>3. The Ocean: You can tell they're just totally rockin out here and having a hell of a time. really awesome. <BR>4. Bring It on Home: PERFECT ENDING. <br />One complaint. I wish it was longer.
B000002I7H|5.0|This was my very first Albert King LP. It was released as the height of the 1960s Blues Mania and so did very well with white listeners. However, the album is really a re-release of several singles and additonal session material that was done at Stax during 1966-1968. The real story is that Atlantic stole the whole Stax catalogue under a clever distribution agreement. This lead eventually to Stax's total demise in the Mid-1970s.<br /><br />The album is a great overview of King's early period with Stax. Actually, it is a double album- the seminal album \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\", with additonal cuts. All bonus tracks are originally from that Stax classic album-the most influential Black Blues LP of the late sixties.<br /><br />The tunes include his classics such as \\"Laundromat Blues\\" Albert's first Stax release with his soulful double string bends, \\"Overall Junction\\" a mono instrumental masterpiece, that unlike Albert Collins or Freddie King tunes has no primary melody \\"or head\\". He offers \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" a tune he recorded in one take as an overdub to the MG's backing track, \\"I Love Lucy\\" is a great example of his talking blues abilities (he was one of the best) and the guitar is super raw with superb bends! \\"Cold Feet\\" a tune written with drummer Al Jackson, Jr (who also helped him on \\"Night Stomp\\" and produced his famous \\"Live Wire\\" set) it is a great talking blues with a catalogue of King licks-it was his second highest charting single. \\"You Sure Drive A Hard Bargain and You're Gonna Need Me\\" are later cuts that were added on the release of the original LP. \\"Bargain\\" was a cover a another R&B tune with a great Memphis Horns chart and \\"Need Me\\" is a self-penned Albert Classic that became the basis for Otis Rush's \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\".<br /><br />\\"Crosscut Saw\\" is my personal favourite with \\"Personal Manager\\" second. Crosscut Saw was an old 1940s tune which was given a rumba beat and still was originally released even though the first tape had been damaged! \\"Manager\\" is a great showcase for King's soloing technique. It may even be too much for some people! \\"The Very Thought of You\\" and \\"I Almost Lost My Mind\\" are great examples of Albert's Big Band Blues roots and his great tenor vocal ability. Many people are thrown by these tunes as not being really blues, but they demonstrate the versatility of this genre.<br /><br />\\"The Hunter\\" is a famous tune that was never a hit for Albert, but was on his Bad Sign LP. Ike and Tina Tuner later recorded it with much success. \\"Oh Pretty, Woman\\" is a powerful tune that has been covered many times (Gary Moore, John Mayall) but was never actually a hit for Albert. It was wrtitten by WDIA's A.C. Williams and demonstrates the close link Stax had to Black radio play (Rufus Thomas was also a DJ there!). \\"As the Years Go Passing By\\" is one of Albert's best slow blues numbers. The best take of this tune is to be found on the \\"Hard Bargain\\" CD released after his death and has many outtakes from this period! No one really knows who wrote the song or where it originally came from. Dedric Malone, another DJ is credited with penning it.<br /><br />Finally the thrilling instrumental, his first in stereo, \\"Funk-Shun\\" contains his famous stop break bending from his original tune \\"Won't Be Hanging 'Round\\" (Although this phrase is never actually sung in the tune, a charactersitic he must have learned when he played with Jimmy Reed!). It is great, but too short! This LP is a great overall introduction to the Albert King style of Blues. An essential part of any Blues collection!showcase for King's soloing technique.

B00005JL3A|5.0|This movie is just utterly amazing! I LOVED it! I rate it 6 stars! This is a sexy horror film. Hot chicks that kick ass! This is kinda based on the game but only the T-virus and zombies part. I prefer you don't play the game before watching it becuase a lot of people who played the game then watched the movie were dissappointed. I usually don't watch or like any horror movies but this is definately an exception. Its scary but not too scary. There were some sad parts which I liked. Overall this is a great movie.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones has escaped the jinx of the sophomore release with a great new set of songs.  While her debut cd was decidedly more jazzy, this new cd taps into blues and country as well.  As soon as I heard the new single, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, I knew I had to have the entire cd.  Smooth and mellow (and yes, I know all of us have described her songs this way--but it fits), &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is a great cd to pop in the player, kick back and relax.<br />My favorite songs are the first single, &quot;Sunrise&quot;; &quot;Creepin' In&quot;, which teams Norah with country legend, Dolly Parton;  &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot;, &quot;Carnival Town&quot;---to name a few.  If you liked her first cd, you are bound to found something on this cd you will like.<br />Forget any naysayers who dismiss this cd.  If you like Norah Jones, and good music, you'll like &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;.  I highly recommend it!!!

And what a sound it is! The tracks are full of heart-rending and through-provoking lyrics, which is to expected given Anastacia's real-life scare with breast cancer. But don't expect the lyrics or album to be a downer. Believe me, if anyone is a Survivor Chick, it's Anastacia and she proves it by rockin' out at full blast! Don't miss this album!

0194367959|2.0|The dictionary is excellent, and the extras as very good as well. This is a very well known product and I won't spend much to praise it. It lacks thesaurus, though.    My problem is with the CD-Cops protection used (and you're not told when buying). It is tricky, sometimes it will stop working with no explanation and manual registry cleaning is necessary to fix it. And now, I found out that the dictionary will not start without the cd-drom drive in the bay, even when I'd done the full installation.    If you want my advice, go for the Collins Cobuild, that will give you less fancy extras, but more functionality: a thesaurus and lots of usage examples.    UPDATE on 19 Sept. 2004 - after managing to find someone useful in OUP support team, I finally got free of charge an update that solved all the problems I was experiencing. Apparently my version has some incompatibility with Win XP.

B0001HAHXW|4.0|Pretty low key approach here, very similar in spirit to the Johnson tribute sets Bluesbreaker successor Peter Green sang (along with his minder Nigel Watson) five years ago.  A couple arrangements are very close indeed and it leads off with the same song.  Of course, Clapton sells to a much bigger market than Green; he's sort of become the Nat King Cole of the 60's gang, a once influential instrumentalist who concentrates on singing for a big market.  The Green sets may be a little stronger due to Green's unhinged singing and inspired harmonica playing but Clapton does a solid job here.  The early fifties Muddy Waters/Jimmy Rogers band seems to be an occasional model (especially 32/20 Blues).  <br />Clapton has become a fine singer over the years and it's always nice to hear him tackle some meaty songs.  They don't come much meatier than Robert Johnson's songs.  80's session supermen Steve Gadd and Nathan East provide rhythm and fellow oldtimer Billy Preston plays the keyboards, which is apt since Clapton was a main player on Preston's Apple debut in 1969 (Billy's been playing sessions over 40 years now and can be heard on the great Sam Cooke Night Beat sessions from 1963).  Not a whole lot of guitar fireworks here but Clapton already did that stuff on his earlier blues tribute &quot;From the Cradle&quot;.  This one will go easy on the ears and sounds like it will wear well over time.  Anytime Clapton wants to cover strong songs I'll certainly want to hear the results.

B00005M989|5.0|I have to admit, I always liked Prince.  I love the whole Purple Rain album, but I have to say I do not own even one of his albums.<BR>I had to buy this. It has every single that I have always cherished.  So if you are not a die-hard fan, but like his hits.  This is the only Prince CD you need.  I do wish they put &quot;Pop Life&quot; on it, but I am not complaining.  This CD is Slamming' and should be in everyone's collection.  Even if you are just a fan of just the singles Prince put out, this Collection has it all (except &quot;Pop Life&quot;.)Yes there are a few more, the Batman theme etc.  But, it's still awesome.<BR>This CD still deserves a 5 out of 5 stars for the not so in love with Prince fans, but love his singles.  I say get this CD.  It has 17 unforgettable tracks that take you back to the days of retro fun and then take you into the present, this whole CD is a FUN RIDE!!  Amen for this compilation.
B00006CXXU|4.0|A year and a half after its release, Christina Aguilera's sophomore album \\"Stripped\\" is a phenomenon; one of those rare occurences, it is a CD that exploded in popularity through word of mouth (besides the risque video for \\"Dirrty\\", there seemed to be no promotion at all) and has been an immense impact on music sales charts around the world.<BR>Christina Aguilera, once living in the shadow of Britney Spears (a highly unfair situation by any talent-lover's standards), has since established herself as one of the most popular and gifted singers of her generation. She does not indulge in the glossy, mass-hysteria hype that propels the likes of Justin Timberlake and Beyonce Knowles to the dizzying heights of fame, but that seems to suit her just fine; unlike nearly every other singer of her generation, Christina knows she will be around for a long time, and \\"Stripped\\" has confirmed that.<BR>Jettisoning the meaningless pop that tainted her self-titled debut, Aguilera decided to move on to better things. She brought us \\"Stripped\\", an album so dense with emotion and melody that it even captured the attention of non-believers. Eighteen months in the making, the album is an experimental piece that succeeds on almost every level. From the writhing sexuality of \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" to the flamenco psychedelia of \\"Make Over\\", Aguilera proves that she has not only grown up, but has developed an edge that sets her on an infinitely higher level to her pop counterparts. <BR>However, there are a few glitches in an otherwise perfect 78 minutes; \\"Soar\\" is beautifully sung but trite, \\"Fighter\\" is somewhat overproduced and \\"The Voice Within\\" is purely Mariah-by-the-numbers - quite unexpected with a producer like Glen Ballard on board. Having said that, those are only three songs out of twenty (including four interludes), and even the worst songs on \\"Stripped\\" are a glowing alternative to the trash that infects the charts these days.<br />Despite the amazing number of potential singles on the album, critics called \\"Stripped\\" an unfocused and incoherent CD, largely due to its covering many genres. In my opinion, this is what makes the album so special; no two songs may sound the same, but they all have a common theme: getting over the pain of the past to become a strong and independent individual.<BR>Finally, the album has two major attributes that propel Aguilera to a deserved \\"diva\\" status: the slinky, swooning blues of \\"Walk Away\\" and the shocking nakedness of \\"I'm OK\\", an ironically-titled and emotional account of the singer's childhood with an abusive father. These two particular tracks show Aguilera's daring - her inhibitions gone, she reveals herself to her audience and establishes herself as the kind of singer Britney and Beyonce could never be.<BR>Whether or not Christina Aguilera will ever achieve the full respect she deserves (her losing the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album to Justin Timberlake was a joke), she has nevertheless created the perfect foundation for her future.
006092988X|5.0|This book was quite good.  This book was only on my reading list since my senior year in high school.  I am a freshman in college and have finally read this lovely peice of literature.  Betty Smith portrays a beautiful life of Francie Nolan and her growing up in Brooklyn.  Her family-Johnny and Katie (her parental units), Laurie and Neely (her sister and brother), Sissy and Eva (her aunts) all help build the pages of this book with a since of character and wit.  The simplicity in this book is fantastic.  I'm not very good at summarizing but basically it is about Francie and her family through out a period of over a decade in New York.  Francie's family is poor, yet they are one of the purest families out there.  I especially loved &quot;Book One&quot;, this section made me feel like a  kid again.  I loved Betty Smith's descriptions of the weekends, and collecting &quot;junk&quot; and the pictures of the candy stores and library in my mind.  It is a classic indeed and recomend it to anyone.

And as far as Im concerned this is Quentin Tarantino's best film.<BR>Many people, I like to call them idiots, said that this film was a backward step for Tarantino. These people wanted another Pulp Fiction basically despite the fact that if Tarantino was to do another film exactly like Pulp Fiction it would be the biggest backward step he could ever take. And so he ventured forth and took on the massive chore of creating a martial arts cinema masterpiece, and succeeded.<BR>True this is the first part of a two part film but anything this amazing deserves to stand on its own and thus I think that it should be judged as a seperate film and given its rightful place among the all time greatest films ever made.<BR>So in short if you like Kill Bill I like you and want to be your freind, and if you dont like it I hate you and wish you would open your mind. Because if you open your mind I might like you eventually.

B00003CX5P|1.0|First off, let me say that one star isn't low enough.  I would have preffered to give this movie a negative score, but I can't find a way to make this stupid thing do that!<BR>     In the original Star Wars, there is suspence and drama because we are given a chance to know and care about the characters.  Special effects are tools of the trade, used to aid in the telling of the story.  It seems that the new trend is to come up with some really &quot;cool&quot; special effects, then string them together with bad dialogue and call it a movie.  Maybe we (the movie-going public) should petition George Lucas (and the Wachowski brothers too, while we're at it) to just stop.  Star Wars: Episodes I and II both SUCK.  I don't intend to even watch Episode III.
B00000DLUV|5.0|Recorded at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on November 14th, 1997. The Bee Gees perform 24 of their greatest hits such as: Stayin Alive, Lonely Days, &amp; Tragedy. They are backed by a 5 piece band. The Band is: Ben Stivers on Keyboards, Matt Bonelli on Bass Guitar, Stephen Rucker on Drums, Alan Kendall on Lead Guitar &amp; Stephen Gibb (Barry's Son) On Guitar. This CD also includes a duet with Celine Dion called Immortality. This CD is awesome. Enjoy.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|Apparently, when airlines plan the in-flight \\"entertainment\\" on their cross-country flights, they go under three assumptions: 1. They have a captive audience. 2. This audience would rather look at a tiny screen in the dark than see the Rocky Mountains. 3. People that fly in airplanes are stupid and in menopause (note that, unlike this movie, I am drawing a distinction between these two groups).<BR>   This movie is nothing more grandiose than a low-grade soft-porn flick for old people. That neither the director nor the target audience realize this only further emphasizes the need for a serious re-evaluation of the voting privelages of the elderly. Personally, I would feel safer if our leaders were selected by 10-year-olds than by the ogling herds of fading Baby Boomers in elastic waisted pants that make up this movie's target audience.<BR>   Despite what the movie suggests, a man of Jack Nickelson's personal appearance and manner and age would only get a stupid young woman to eagerly wriggle out of her low-rise jeans if he was waving a couple of hundred dollars at her. (Note that the director eagerly waved a good bit more than a couple hundred at the actresses in this movie). Despite the fact that Jack once was young - he is not anymore - much like Joan Collins and Bill Clinton. He is an elderly, liver-spotted fool, and the movie only reminds us of this. I personally find this comforting, since it suggests that, one day, all of the Jack Nickelsons in the world will be dead - and we will thus be rid of them. <BR>  Of course Diane Keaton is just as laughable. Looking like she's had enough facelifts to safely tuck her chin(s) behind her ears (Diane to her private Surgeon: \\"COME ON! PULL IT TIGHTER! MY NEXT MOVIE IS SUPPOSED DEMONSTRATE THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE JUDGED BY THEIR AGE AND LOOKS!\\"), she has all the emotional clarity that can imaginably be associated with a particularly ugly menopause. Diane is as likely to steal the heart of Keanu Reeves as she is to steal theheart of Alfonso the sea lion. Wait - scratch that - Sea lions are both overly amorous and near-sighted. Someone please tell Diane to steer clear of public aquaria!<BR>  In an effort to pile one insulting plot-twist on top of another, we are not only forced to watch Jack Nickelson and Diane Keaton hoot and hump all over the screen like a pair of manure-smeared orangutans, but they are unfortunately also given lines. We are thus faced not only with the impossible demand of picturing these miserable old fools constantly scoring young movie stars, but we are also asked to believe that they're clever and witty while doing it. I can only assume that they believe their audience is excessively gullible, lulled by the hormonal imbalances and extreme wishful thinking of a generation that thought JFK was an upright citizen. Then again, I was entrusting my life to a large chunk of machinery that was hurtling through the air 7 miles above the earth while I watched this movie. Who am I to talk about gullibility?<BR>   This movie demonstrates that, for the ideal retired person of today, the flower of old age - wisdom - has been traded in for a second go at the orangutan pen. If you're one of these old fools - by all means, watch this movie. If there's any dignity and decency left in your balding, liver-spotted skulls, it will awake screaming at the full-frontal assault this movie subjects it to. If this doesn't happen - may I suggest the SkyMall catalogue and a miniature bag of pretzels?

B00005JMEW|5.0|Japanese lore has a word for the people who  gave this film less than four stars: idiot. i mean, what were you thinking? firstly, its not a bad influence to kids because blood just doesn't flow like that. its not ripping off Japanese culture or anything like that, it's paying homage to the grindhouse(of which Japan was a major supplier to). the very movies that inspired Tarantino to make the likes of Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction which these same people either haven't seen or hated because they are idiots. i say that again, BECAUSE THEY ARE IDIOTS<br />This film is not original, it is an eclectic blend of classic movie styles which, because it features neither CG nor explosions nor the most convoluted type of love story tripe, grates horribly for anyone without a 1970s to 1980s sensibility. or, for that matter, an open mind.<br />The Kudos are as follows: Uma Thurman is brilliant and more violent than Arnie as The Bride. David Carradine, in just a few of his scenes, makes a villainous presence quicker than any villain currently in cinema(why isn't he in more movies?) Yuen Woo-Ping, who out does his impressive work on the Matrix movies, and Tarantino himself for bumping the grind(house).<br />The insults are as follows: anyone who deemed this movie too violent, too boring, too unlike Pulp Fiction, too harmful to Llamas, Ferrets or indeed any vertebrate animal, and anyone who has said a bad word about this movie. they can go watch Forrest Gump for all i care, all i want are three things:<br />A Samurai Sword, A Yellow Tracksuit, and Volume 2!!!
B0001Z363W|2.0|This cd would be alright if it had been released under the Zakk Wylde name alone, like &quot;Pride &amp; Glory&quot; and &quot;Book Of Shadows&quot;, but as a BLS cd, it does not cut it. <BR> Do not let the song titles fool you...this is a totally mellow cd. Cool songs include &quot;Crazy Or High&quot;, &quot;Steppin' Stone&quot; and &quot;House Of Doom&quot;.  Even these tracks are extremely mellow for BLS. As usual, all tracks include awesome guitar solos and guitar work in general. Pop &quot;Just Killing Time&quot; or &quot;Spoke In The Wheel&quot; in the cd player before buying this and you'll be ready for this cd.<BR> In closing, this is not a bad cd, just not a BLS one.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Brian Cox, as the title of this review may suggest, is God. because like God, he is everywhere. the man has more credits than an upmarket beverly Hills blonde with a gold card, a rich husband and bad cases of both cleptomanian and nymphomania.<br />And X2 is just another notch on the now non-existent belt of Mr. Cox, here playing a crackpot militia type who wants to wipe out all mutants in a high octane action sequel that actually works. read that last line again. now again...<br />Actually, Brian Cox's is among one of the great performances in this movie, with Hugh Jackman going crazy with claws, Ian McKellen getting hammy with helmets, and Patrick Stewart getting wild with wheelchairs. and alll with cool powers.<br />There is some great action sequences, one or two nice emotional scenes, and a general lack of Halle Berry, which make this the action movie and summer movie to get your mutated tentacles into.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|first off, the review a few back about maynard falling in love seems completely off base.  I couldn't even get beyond the explanation of the &quot;third step&quot;, he was so far off track that it was hopeless.  I know Maynard has stated that APC is an outlet for his feminine side, but an album centered around him falling in love would make me call for the apocalypse in much the same way that he did in Tool's Aenema.  With Maynard, the subject material is always going to be complex, abstract, and vague enough to be open to multiple interpretations--love being one of the few interpretations that are not possible.  Substance use is clearly a theme here; the first two songs make that clear enough, as well as the title, a seeming take-off on AA's 12-step rehabilitation program.  But another way to look at it is the fact that traditionally, a gallows would have 13 steps up to the noose where one would be hanged.  This album to me then seems like the ultimate Maynard clever trick: make people think that the album becomes progressively more positive (as the &quot;healing&quot; reviews have alluded to), while actually a sort of secret deterioration is taking place.  Self-destruction, in fact.  You take your first step toward the hypothetical noose when you become addicted (The Package and Weak and Powerless), maybe try to cover up with transparent religious fervor (The Noose), experience further isolation (Blue, Vanishing, A Stranger), entertain suicidal thoughts (The Outsider), pause as your fate looms nearby (Crimes), experience a delusional, drug-induced romance (The Nurse Who Loved Me), try to prevent your kid from going thru what you've gone thru, but to no avail(Pet), say your parting words, &quot;go back to sleep&quot; (Lullaby), and finally come to terms with your imminent death by at least partially affirming the life you've lived and/or some sort of afterlife, &quot;I choose to live...&quot;(Gravity)  <BR>now there's a bitter pill to swallow.  But no one ever saidthat I was the nurse who loved you all.
B000002UVX|5.0|The Band Of Gypsy's proved hendrix's virtouso ability to go anywhere he wanted to with the guitar. The first time I bought the orginal album of the Band Of Gypsy's I was floored. I loved all of Hendrix's Experience days but when this came out I almost loved him even more for what he was doing. This just really floored us all expesically on Machine Gun running over 20 minutes long. With Buddy Miles laying down the beat and Billy Cox giving Funk Machine Gun was truely the best song on the album. After the record came out I wanted to here Hendrix do a studio version of Machine Gun so bad but unfortuantly Hendrix died in 1970 leaving us all. <br />When most people ask what Jimi Hendrix album should I really here him playing his heart out I always reference to The Band Of Gypsy's. Hendrix did so much on this album on songs like Power Of Soul, and Machine Gun. I was even more impressed when Experience Hendrix released their version of The Band Of Gypsy's the full concert wow. But I still love this album to this day its probaley the best Jimi Hendrix live album that was ever released. Jimi Hendrix did break up with the band and would latter re-join the Jimi Hendrix Experience with Billy Cox on Bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums. But truely this is the real deal Jimi Hendrix and The Band Of Gypsy's Buy This. Highly Recomened!!!!
B0001BKAEE|5.0|This movie completes this trilogy very well. The 3 movies are a metaphor of life. The first question you should ask yourself is what is the matrix? and the second one should be what is Zion? The first one represents the exterior world while the second represents our innerself. The movie describes the struggles of a human being that is looking for something else from life than just to eat, to sleep, to work, etc. What is great about it is how such important ideas is presented with sophistication of form and an imaginative storyline. This third movie finally clarifies many of the ideas already presented in the previous movies. If you are happy to be part of the matrix than don't bother watching it. Just stay at home and watch some reality show.

076781326X|5.0|Until CHICAGO reenergized the movie musical genre, this musical version of Charles Dickens' immortal \\"Oliver Twist\\" was widely regarded as one of the last of the great movie musicals.  Indeed, with its high-energy performances, infectious music, steady direction by Sir Carol Reed and glorious sets, this movie won the 1968 Best Picture Oscar over such formidable competition as THE LION IN WINTER, CHARLEY, and FUNNY GIRL.  <br />Of course, most people are familiar with the classic story of young Oliver Twist, whose mother dies giving him birth and is forced to be raised under the cruel supervision of the English workhouse officials.  When he dares beg for more than his meager ration of gruel, the youngster is apprenticed to an undertaker and his extremely nasty family.  After escaping this hostile environment, he finds himself taken in by the roguish Fagin,  the Artful Dodger(Fagin's best pupil), and the rest of his band of young pickpockets.  In time, however, Oliver will find his home, but not before dealing with the likes of the brutal Bill Sikes with the help of Sike's sympathetic lover, Nancy, and the kindly Mr. Brownlow.  <br />As musical films go, it is hard to fault the wonderful casting in this film.  Mark Lester makes a perfectly, if maybe overly, innocent Oliver, while Jack Wild is a delight as the rascally Artful Dodger.  Shanie Wallis is heart-rending as the tragic Nancy.  Oliver Reed (Sir Carol's nephew) is truly scary as the menacing Bill Sikes.  Harry Secombe displays a glorious tenor in the comic role of Mr. Bumble, the beadle of the workhouse.  However, it is Ron Moody's fantastic performance of the rascally Fagin that steals this movie. It is not surprising, when you consider that he created the role when the musical was first produced in London.  Of course, the character itself has gone quite a change from Dickens' original, going from the debatably nasty anti-Semitic portrait of the novel  to that of  a lovable, if sneaky, eccentric.  Indeed, Moody's excellent portrayal would set the tone for almost all future performances of the role to date, including those of such actors as George C. Scott and Richard Dreyfus, among others. <br />Some Dickens fans may quibble about the liberties taken with the book, from the softening of Fagin to the elimination of Oliver's evil step-brother Monks from the storyline.  And it isn't a perfect film by any means. (The child singer who dubbed Mark Lester's songs sounds like she's in an echo chamber of some sort, which makes Oliver's singing a jarring contrast to the rest of the cast.)  But, as a musical film, it is a wonderful entertainment and superb introduction to the classic story.  As a result, this is one musical that I would DEFINITELY recommend.
B0001EFTS8|2.0|I picked this DVD up at a local store, because I've been meaning to see the movie and it was quite cheap.  It's the original 1927 theater cut (I couldn't tell you if the tinting was added later or not), which means it's only a small part of Lang's masterpeice.  The plot is, as it was, choppy and hard to follow without reading up on the movie itself.  The scenes that were cut seem to have been important, in that you get the general gist of the story with this truncated version, but there are things you won't pick up on unless you watch it repeatedly.<br />It's a poor version of the classic, but the price is right.  If you want to see the masterpeice, buy the restored, authorized edition as was recommended above.  If you want to watch a mildly entertaining silent film that sounds like the soundtrack was put together by the Residents, this is for you.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|The truth is, all 4 of his &quot;American Recordings&quot; are great, and though &quot;Unchained&quot; is my favorite, this is excellent too. It's definitely the album with the most well known covers, which are just as impressive as his originals. Included is the wonderful &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;, &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, and the popular &quot;Hurt&quot;. However they're mostly all superb, with only a couple that are fair. I think after a few listens of this album, or any of his releases, you'll understand why he's not just a country music icon, but an american icon.
0803729227|5.0|We just received this book and it has already become one of my son's favorites. We had to read it twice the day it came and he is asking for it every night. It is a beautiful book, I fell in love with it the first time I read it to him. The text flows smoothly, the story is wonderful, it shows how even if your different you can get along and help one another. It also teaches that it doesn't matter what size you are , you can make a difference. The illustrations are wonderful, alot of detail and color. Just all around one of the best books I have ever purchased.
B00005OMTT|4.0|This is a great and lengthy collection of some of the best of &quot;Enigma&quot;. It's a wonderful mix of new age, electronica, and world music. 18 remastered tracks including the hits &quot;Return To Innocence&quot;, &quot;Sadness, Pt. 1&quot;, and &quot;Gravity Of Love&quot;, plus the favorites &quot;Shadows In Silence&quot;, &quot;Age Of Loneliness&quot;, and &quot;Cross Of Changes&quot;. I don't think anything major is missing, and the casual fan should be pleased with what's here. So if you're looking for a great experience, try &quot;L.S.D.&quot;.
4789009637|5.0|My Japanese teacher used this book in our classes and it was an excellent choice.  It can easily be used for self-study, especially if used with the CDs.  Each lesson starts out with a dialog and is followed by a vocabulary list, grammar explanations, and vocabulary/grammar practice.  The grammar is explained very clearly and the practice exercises are very useful for remembering what is being taught.  One drawback: no answers are given.  The vocabulary lists are not always comprehensive but they give lots of useful vocabulary.  Several topics are covered including shopping, talking about family, travel, daily routines, and health.  The book also includes lessons on Katakana, Hiragana, and Kanji.  <br />I took the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (Level 4) after 5 months studying with this book and passed.  The Kanji included was very useful as were the grammar points and vocabulary.  If you can, I recommend getting the CDs and the workbook.  The CDs are excellent.  You can practice pronunciation with the dialogs and vocabulary lists and the CDs also include listening exercises for the text and workbook.  The workbook covers more grammar and vocabulary as well as Kanji, Katakana, and Hiragana practice.<br />This is the best Japanese textbook I've encountered.  It is well organized and relevant.  I give it 5 stars without hesitation!
B00005JKGO|5.0|Although \\"8 1/2\\" is often touted as Fellini's greatest work, this other, equal masterpiece from roughly the same period grows more and more profound over time. An amazingly photographed and energetic survey of ennui and despair, \\"La Dolce Vita\\" is Fellini's rumination on the intellectual and moral death of an aspiring artist, who is equally a Fellini surrogate and a stand-in for the director's perception of modern man. <br />Though it began life as a sequel to \\"Il Bidone,\\" \\"La Dolce Vita\\" ended up an autobiographical precursor to \\"8 1/2\\" by fictionalizing Fellini's earlier life as a journalist and newspaper caricaturist rather than his career as one of the great filmmakers of the 50s and 60s. As the celebrity journalist in crisis, Marcello is fantastic -- as graceful and intelligent and sexy a performance as the screen has ever seen -- and his romp with the unbelievably pneumatic Anita Ekberg in the Trevi fountain is one of the great iconic moments of world cinema. There's a haunted, despairing quality to Mastroianni's acting here that is so subtle and cumulative that by the end of the film his predicament of quiet despair overwhelms the viewer.<br />Bottom line: no thinking person's film collection should be without this movie, which is as beautiful and moving as any piece of art ever created, in any medium. Fellini and his fantastic cast are all at their peak as artists, and few films have ever approached their achievement.
0671027387|5.0|Another top-of-the-line thriller from Dan Brown; this one educates the reader about the inner workings of NASA while also being one heck of an exciting read. The only competition Brown might have in this genre is first-time author John Robert Marlow, whose novel NANO educates readers about nanotechnology while also being (like Brown's books) a damned good read. Can't wait to see the next book from each author!

B0000AQVCL|4.0|Jet is the perfeect modern day band for people who's music collection is made up of music that wasn't even recorded this century. I am a die-hard Beatles fan who people thought would never listen to a band from today.  Jet's first album 'Get born' managed to turn the right gears in my head and prove others wrong.  When I saw the album cover it was obivous that great classic Rock bands had influnced them, and i could tell.  Jet has an orginal sound and I recogmend buying this album!<br />~Madison (madelfgirl)
B000092Q4U|5.0|Lamb of God. What a welcome breath of fresh air in such a stale scene of American Metal. This band, together with similar bands in the same vein such as Killswitch Engage(also a beautifully brutal band), and Shadows Fall are leading the charge of new metal in America. Without a doubt, if this is not the metal record of the year, it is by FAR the metal record of the year in the States.<br />What makes this cd so impressive is the sheer brutality of the riffs, and the sledgehammer impact of the punishing double bass. This band has taken notes from old school metal, and from the sheer force of the tradeoff dual guitar harmonies and solos you can see how much this band values bands that have came before them. Randy Blythe, Lamb of God's singer, has a very distinctive vocal style. He adds tremendous value to this band, as does both of their guitarists. Listen to the very first song(also one of the best on the album) Ruin, and if you aren't immediately impressed by his 15 second high to low to high again piercing scream, then you need some schooling in the art of metal. Chris Adler provides the endless onslaught of ungodly snare, hi hat, cymbal, and double bass work. It is truly impressive to hear such talent in a band, and all of the band members unite seamlessly for maximum effect. <br />I personally believe #1, #2, #3, #4, #7, and finally #8 seal the deal for an absolutely brutal album by one of America's finest up and coming metal bands. They decimate live, and will rip the skin off the connecting tissue while you rock like a madman. Best Buy has this cd for $9.99, and at that price it makes it a very easy purchase(and a very worthy one at that) for your metal needs. Turn this one up loud as hell, and enjoy. Metal is coming back with a vengeance. Thank you Lamb of God, you give us all hope. \m/
B000084T18|1.0|this album is just shows how far hip-hop has gone down. i remember the days of eric b and rakim and how good hip-hop used to be. this cd glorifies violence, womenizing and all the negative things. we can't being teaching our children this, we need positive music to uplift the culture.

B00005JLZN|4.0|I enjoy a surprising ending when it lends coherence to the rest of the movie and not when the surprise is for the sake of surprise itself. I like to see a final fact lending credibility and answers to many questions or holes you had during the viewing. A surprising ending should be such that when you rewind the movie in your mind, bearing the new fact, everything should fall in place. <BR>Although the ending of &quot;David Gale&quot; was not totally a surprise - as the viewer could guess his way through, the last facts did render coherence and answered many questions (such as the passivity of Gale's attorney and the connection between the attorney and Dusty). However, what mainly stayed on my mind is the wonder what will Bitsy do with the new information. Was the new information intended to help her clear her guilt for not &quot;making it on time&quot; or will she use this fact in her coverage? probably not, but if so, what will this new fact do to the credibility of the anti death penalty group? Another issue is the great acting ability of David Gale, which should have been an ordinary person, and not another Kevin Spacey. This is something I cannot explain.<BR>This is a strong movie in the sense of the powerful moving actors, the intriguing plot and the way the story is told; however, politically speaking and in answer to other viewers, I did not feel the movie did anything to affect my views (which were not very definite to start with) on the issue of death penalty. The movie was unable to give us viewers an innocent face to remember when thinking of the death row and in many ways the anti death penalty people were pictured as fanatics. The very important argument of preserving the sanctity of life, of not taking another person's life was not raised in the movie.<BR>It is interesting to see how involved Bitsy becomes during the search for the truth and how she too is exposed. Her crying outside the room after watching the first tape was one of the most moving parts of the movie and a very human reaction she shares with the viewers. The contrast between moments such as this one (or Gale's frustration after his inability to talk to his son), the great sympathy the viewer has towards Gale and Constance and on the other hand the very fanatic radical actions were difficult to reconcile.
2913903878|5.0|While this book has less volume in the amount of stuff than Douboy to GI. it is exactly what I was looking for in a militaria type book. I mostly wanted information about packs and helmets so I would be educated in what type to look for to make a nice display with my WWII jeep. well I wish I had just bought this book and used the money I spent on the other book on a couple of pieces. I love the fact that it shows some other equipment that I am interested in like radio's and such. and the large color pictures give me the kind of detail that I can rember when I run across an item at a flea market or swap meet.

B0001IN0DA|5.0|1. U.S. Championship<br />  John Cena vs. The Big Show(c): 6/10 I'm Not a big fan of either guy, but this was a decent match regardless.<br />2. World Tag Team Championship<br />  Mark Jindrak/Garrison Cade vs. La Resistance vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. RVD/Booker T(c): 5/10 Okay match, suffered from having too many other stellar matches on the card.<br />3. Chris Jericho vs. Christian: 9/10 Awesome match.  Both competitors are unbelieveably underrated and under utilzed. Almost a show stealer.<br />4. Mick Foley/The Rock vs. Ric Flair/Batista/Randy Orton: 8.5/10 Another great match. I'm not a big Rock fan, but anything with the legends Foley and Flair or soon to be legends Batista and Orton is definately worth watching.<br />5. WWE Tag Team Championship<br />  APA vs. Basham Brothers vs. TWGTT vs. Scotty2Hotty/Rikishi(c): 2/10 The only part of the event that was really not worth watching.<br />6. Crusierweight Championship Open<br />  Chavo Guerreo, Rey Mysterio, Jamie Noble, Kidman, Shannon Moore, Nunzio, Funaki, Tajiri, and Ultimo Dragon: 6/10 Some good fast paced action, but needed to be a bit longer.<br />7. Brock Lesner vs. Goldberg...Special Referee Steve Austin: 7/10 Neither one of these guys is that good, but they had a pretty good contest regardless.  I hated the ending though.<br />8.

WWE Championship<br />  Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerreo: 9.5/10 A classic contest. I expected Angle to crush Eddie, Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Eddie fan, I just didn't think he was ready for the spotlight yet. I am very, very, pleased that he's proven me wrong.<br />11. Kane vs. The Undertaker: 8/10 Really wish taker had longer  hair, but the enterences for both were worth watching alone, then they have a pretty good match on top of it.<br />12. World Championship<br />  Shawn Micheals vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H(c): 10/10 Unquestionalbly the best match of the night. An instant classic. For me this was worth the price of the ppv on it's own. All three of these guys proved once again why they are some of the best the world has ever seen.<br />Overall, this was one of, if not the very best wrestling events I have ever seen.  Anyone who does not at least watch WrestleMania XX doesn't deserve to call themselves a wrestling fan. A must ownwatching alone, then they have a pretty good match on top of it.<br />12. World Championship<BR>    Shawn Micheals vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H(c): 10/10 Unquestionalbly the best match of the night. An instant classic. For me this was worth the price of the ppv on it's own.

0140177396|5.0|While I can't stand it when writer's use the Lord's name in vain, I think John Steinbeck was without a doubt one of the greatest writers ever.  He has the unique ability to say a LOT with a small amount of words in one paragraph, and in the very next paragragh say a little with a LOT of words.  This novel should be read by anyone wanting to master the craft of writing.  Steinbeck delivers every time.  I can't think of any bad writing he has done...Can you?<br />God Bless!<br />[...]

On this CD the average is 7.2, but this song DOES have the highest rated song of both CDs, &quot;The Scientist&quot;. I have to admit I am biased because it reminds me of a girl I loved; to this day it still can make me cry.<br />While I was always a fan, Coldplay quickly became one of my absolute favorite bands when I purchased both CDs because I realized that I had been missing out on a lot of great songs that I never found downloading from KaZaa. It's worth it to buy.
