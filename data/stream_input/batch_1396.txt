0525423281|4.0|If you haven't read Anna and the French Kiss (and are planning to) you may want to read it first as this book has spoilery characters from Anna in it.  Anyways, Lola and the Boy Next Door is an adorable read.  I loved both main characters in this book and their endearing quirks.  It's also extremely well-written.  If you like John Green, you'll probably like Stephanie Perkins.  Read this if you're in the mood for a great contemporary YA romance :)
1451627289|5.0|...as my heart felt with pure satisfaction. I LOVED this book. Stephen King has done it again. I have been reading King since my 15th birthday when I received 'IT' as a present, I am now 40, and I was hooked after that. I picked up this book several times just to gage the size and flip through the pages only to put it down, but it keep calling out to me, pulling me in, as his books often do. I wondered how good can this book be, a man going back in time to save JFK, but it was so much more then that. So much more!!! It was about success, failure, friendship and most of all love. It was about letting go and doing what was right. I laughed. I cried. It keep me wondering what was going to happen next. King has me for life. You can't go back as so many of us wish we could. So do the best you can now and learn from the past as not to keep repeating it.
0525478817|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, yup, that's right...one sitting.  I seriously plopped down on the bed - cried and laughed a bunch and hours later looked up with a finished book in my hand.  That being said, I don't really think this is a novel that should be devoured in one go.  I will most assuredly be rereading this sometime later in the year at a more leisurely pace because it deserves time for thoughtful pauses.<br /><br />I can't touch on the plot without fearing that I'll venture into spoilery territory - so I just won't go there.  I will say that both Hazel and Augustus are fantastically witty and loveable characters.  Also, I got a big kick out of the fact that the book is set in Indianapolis.  Since I only live about an hour away, I've visited many of the places mentioned (including Funky Bones)!<br /><br />So I know that this book could be mistakenly lumped into the sappy \\"Cancer Book\\" category but really, it's not.  As Hazel points out, \\"Cancer Books\\" have certain annoying epic tropes inherent in them (such as angelic cancer patients living their lives with quiet dignity).  The Fault in Our Stars is simply about the relationship of two intelligent teenagers who are dealing with cancer (well, and about hopes, fears, life, love, art, poetry, etc).  John Green's amazing writing combined with his ability to realistically portray teenagers make this an extremely poignant read.  This book will resonate with pretty much everyone because it deals with universal questions of mortality and purpose.<br /><br />Originally I thought to give this book 4.5 stars but after further consideration have upped the rating to 5.  The reason for my original assessment was due to the Dawson's Creek-ification of the main characters wherein teenagers have a vocabulary that far surpasses many adults.  In the end, I decided I don't care about this because a) I wish more people in general exhibited a superior grasp of the English language and b) this book is just so darn good it deserves a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Seriously go read this book.  If you're afraid of crying, too bad.  You will cry but it is absolutely more than worth your tears.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|I am fully aware that my brain has done all the work it needed to do so I could write this review, so don't blame me if you find it boring, blame my DNA, my parents , and the environment I was raised in. I will still try and only put useful data into my brain, no TV, with a few exceptions, so what comes out of my head is useful to the continuation of our species.I hope  all of you do the same.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this new version of Angry Birds!! I bought it a six in the morning so I could have it!!! Love the gravity add and new music!!!! Definite BUY!!!!
B002KSPKRS|3.0|I am pretty annoyed overall. There is a constant low humm at all times, which is very apparent at quiet parts of games. Furthermore it crackles like once every 10 minutes or so. I guess it is not that big of a deal, but I was so excited to upgrade from my crappy headset, and this was a bit of a letdown. The controlled voice feedback thing is really good though (the thing that lets you hear yourself talking so you dont yell the whole time).
B00475AYJQ|5.0|So much literature is just someone stringing a bunch of words together and saying \\"he said,she sais, he did,she did.\\" The thing ISO enjoyed about the KingKiller Chronicles is they are true story telling.  Patrick manages to paint picture swith his words and his juxtaposition of the story of the storyteller and the story itself is fantastic.  How he begins and ends with the three silences is a great example.  I highly recommend this as a work of literature not just a high fantasy novel.  My highest endorsement.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|awesome dude im just like wish what is this but it is awesome and amazing and I cant wait till I beat it!!!
0439023521|1.0|\\"the most exciting thing either of us does is nap\\" - katniss everdeen, the hunger games.<br /><br />that's all you need to know about this book, hope the movie is much better.
B00005JKG9|5.0|These are some of the best acting performances ever captured on film. Unless you've done this play as I have you cannot fully appreciate the \\"umms, and uhhs\\" and dual lines and how hard it is to do Mamet. Language aside, this is one of the best plays ever written. Even the Alec Baldwin character (not in the play) is a must see!
B002BIULQC|5.0|This movie is super fun and funny! The quality of the Blu-ray is pretty great too.<br /><br />BUY THIS MOVIE
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it's a really interesting game and I have a fun time playing it when I have nothing to do. PERFECT when you have free time :)
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I got it got about 30-40 elements (give or take) then I tried again and it forced close EVERY single time. then I tried to uninstall it the reinstall it but it just kept saying something like &quot;Problem install. please try again later. SERIOUSLY!?!?!? WHAT GIVES?!?! I did like this app. -_- not so sure anymore!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is an assortment of fun for everyone!!! A great free app! There is a wide variety of games that offer a challenge!
B004VAG65I|5.0|I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie that is soon to be released.  It was great.  Warm, caring, suspenceful, great characters, an easy read, and a page turner.  I am now excited to see the movie.  I hope they do the book justice.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this as a resource in two Bible studies. The variety of translations are helpful and the tools are easy to use.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I love the mobile port and a bit frustrated I missed it as a free app yesterday, but if you want to play it for free, go to armorgames.com where it first originated from.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|I like it so much...<br />It reminds me of 2 of my weirdly favourite albums: Drama and 90125...<br />there is nothing much to say!

1400069289|2.0|Save your money, and go to the library. It's a boring book but has a couple of interesting techniques if you are interested in breaking a habit. The most interesting was about finding the \\"cue\\" of the habit. BUT, those helpful hints are only a few pages long. Better to check this one out at your local library (while they still exist)...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|l was excited to get A G Space.  The gravitational pull adds interesting new demension.  When you find a golden egg, you go flying through space to play Eggstroids.  I discovered something unusual in Eggstroids level.  Unlike other A B games you can get 1, 2, or 3 stars. If you replay a level again and get lower score you can lose a star. I had 2 stars and lost one when I replayed and got lower score.  I got it back when I replayed and got better score.<br /><br />I like this new game except for one thing....something else to keep from doing something else I should be doing.<br />v
0385342063|5.0|I just finished this book, so I'm coming off with initial reactions. This book is not just funny, it's hilarious at times. I can definitely relate to Poppy. Like another reviewer said, I sat up well past midnight. It's the kind of book that you can't wait to finish to see what happens - and when you do, you're sad to have to part with it. It's a light read, great for the beach or vacation. I've always loved Sophie's book Can You Keep a Secret? and I must admit, I've only read the first Shopaholic book, but her books are always very good. This one is probably my new favorite.
1401323952|5.0|I bought this book as much for Nigella's superb writing as much as for the recipes themselves. I find myself reading this in bed, putting post-its on recipes to try and just enjoying what she has to say - I particularly loved the \\"Cook It Better\\" chapter, where she describes her inability to throw anything away. There are recipes here for stale bread (Panzanella, bread pudding), vegetable odds and ends (throw them into a green curry), subpar strawberries (make crumble). I especially enjoyed her describing \\"making a banoffee cheesecake rise out of the sad ashes of a blackening bunch of bananas.\\" So outrageous you can't help but admire her audacity. I have made her Asian Beef stew recipe, which I found a bit too generous with Chinese cooking wine and rice wine vinegar. Chinese people seldom use more than a dash of each, she calls for cups of the stuff. Still, she doesn't pretend to be authentic, and freely advocates adjusting to one's tastes. Agreed. The other recipe I tried - and man I wish I didn't - were her Sweet and Salty Nut Crunch Bars. SO. GOOD. It might sound simple, but taste and see - this is really a case where the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts. Try it and see - every sweet, salty, crunchy, crumbly bit of it. NOT something you make on a diet. OK, I gotta go now. Those bars are calling my name already.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Convenient and handy. Never away from my desktop. Great concept and well executed. And its free to boot. Works like a charm.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game is very hard to stop playing. always going for that extra table or better dish. a very enjoyable game.
0439023483|5.0|It was one of those easy reads that carry you along for hours.  You don't have to think about it, you're inside the book watching.  Very gripping.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy playing angry birds while I am in class, at work, and just at home relaxing. It is a fun and challenging game that captures your attention for hours! There are also lots of new levels you can get by upgrading to the new version, but that's if you have already completed the ones you have or if you just want to. So game on Angry Bird lovers!<br />P.S. It can be very addicting.
B0060FXBNM|1.0|This isn't really transformers, it's a military action movie with lots of explosions and helicopters, with some giant robots in the background.
B000PMG16U|4.0|La entrega fue muy rapida, 4 dias a partir de que lo ordene con entrega al extranjero y el producto en perfectas condiciones.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|The CD is great! I don't usually like a new CD when i first hear it, but this one is the exception. I think anyone who is a fan of heavy music should purchase this CD.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|addicting game i just love it.  I find myself playing it even while watching Tv.  my little girl even likes it.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|this will not allow me to make tobacco. i mix fire and grass and nothing happens at all. but overall its a fantastic game but needs another update. FOUR STARS
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game is awesome.  I have played multiple versions of it and liked every one of them. So when it was the free game of the day I was happy.  I played it until I.reached like 20 something elements and now it stops unexpectedly. This force close problem really needs to be fixed soon.
B003X27L9U|4.0|I loved this book. I would never have picked it up only fr my book clubs pressure! I was dreading the horror of the storyline, the fritzl type outline, but it was brilliant.  Her depiction of life through a five year old's eyes s fabulous, really clever, part of the time you could forget about the horror ofthe situation and why they were in a room in the first place.  She describes the room and the limited items there in with such clarity that you can see them, almost touch them.  Her use of language meant you could feel the cold with the characters, the depression of the mom, the realisation dawning slowly on the child that there is more somewhere, there is an outside.  This is a great book, unputdownable, don't be afraid to pick it up, you'll be hooked!
B006BDHAX0|3.0|please fix the shutdowns. its driving me nuts. I sincerely love this game&hellip; its the best. you've had so many complaints why can't we get this done.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|FINALLY!!! UPDATE AVAILABLE!!! FIXED THE FORCE CLOSE!!! WOO HOO!!! WORKS PERFECTLY NOW!!! YAY!!! I'm so glad they fixed the bug!!!
0446614459|4.0|The story line was well plotted and each chapter was action packed.  I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it to others although I thought the ending could have been a bit more climatic.
1612130283|4.0|I'll start out by saying that I'm not much of a reader. With that being said, after a co-worker told me about this book my curiosity was peaked. I decided to read it...what the heck!!! It is a very interesting read. It is VERY detailed and left me wanting to read every chance I got (which is not like me). The term \\"mommy Porn\\" has been used to describe this book..I can understand that now. I'm a mom of two and after 7 years of marriage...this book has ignited a spark that has been much needed in my relationship...I suggest this book to any woman that needs to add a little \\"umph\\" to their marriage.<br />NOTE: This is a very graphic book and does invole some content that was ...um ..let's just say it's very enlightening...but still has a romantic aspect.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Fantastic book.  John Grisham has never disappointed me with any of his novels.  This one was exceptionally good and enlightenening on how greedy people becomes when money is involved.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Needs a bigger Bible to be used as an oath app on tablets. Simple fix. Please update. When it opens the outside Bible cover should fill the entire screen.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This truly is an invaluable tool, it does exactly what it says and it does it with ease. Tremendously powerful, fast, and well done.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|While \\"The Open Door\\" still remains my favorite Evanescence album, \\"Evanescence\\" is a more-than-satisfactory return for the band after the long departure, revving up their sound with higher energy and a grittier edge. The melodies are a little easier to grasp and so stick more firmly in your head, and every song is amazing to sing along with. I prefer this album to anything playing on the radio nowadays.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Disappointed on some functions (highlighter, notes etc.). Since wi-fi is unavailable at church, I can't make notations during the sermon. I can only &quot;read&quot; the Bible.
0064430227|4.0|First time I ordered a Harold book. I just hope my granddaugter doesn't decide to start coloring the walls.She picks up on everything so I will have to explain the book well. Rather long adventure for a 23 month old. Will wait and see if she will sit still for it to be read to her. Update later
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful App! I'm a busy mom this is fast and easy to use. Keeps me focus most days on my spiritual journey.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Red Wrecker is lots of fun!  Very well done!  It loads fast and works smoothly.  Entertaining and good brain exercise!
B006TGWY3K|2.0|I've enjoyed Lacuna Coil's two previous albums, so I was looking forward to getting this one.  After listening to this new album, I was disappointed that Cristina Scabbia was not featured more on lead vocals.  The new album seemed to be a whole lot more Andrea Ferro taking the lead.  I think he's fine as backup and solo on short stints, but when he takes the lead for long I think the song suffers.  I'm going to have to pass on this one and hope the producer on the next album leans more toward Cristina on vocals.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater.  I thought it was great, so I knew I had to get it.  I suggest that everyone should see this film. It is very moving and relevent to many people's lives.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|good book. my daughter really liked it. once started, she couldn't put the book down  until she finished. she is looking forward to the next 2 books
B003E1G4AC|5.0|It works and looks cool on my desk. Now I just have to keep my<br /> kids way from it.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|I have been reading John Grisham books for quiet a while and even though the movie can't cover the whole book it makes a fascinating 2 hour entertainment. Delivered right on Amazon time.
B006VYFB1C|5.0|I am a baseball, but you don't have to like baseball to like this movie. Its a story about human struggle against all odds. Loved it!
B007DX39XW|5.0|This set is great as the other reviews have stated. It does cost more than the previous versions, but again like noted earlier it is MUCH larger than the other sets, including the emporium. I will add some photos to help give a size reference for those wondering, just look above. I also agree with buying it at lego. Amazon has been known for markups so bad that sometimes its cheaper to even use Ebay. I feel amazon should crack down on it, but these other companies are just trying to make ends meet as well, but adding $50 for nothing when available direct from the manufacture is sad.<br /><br />Highly recommend this kit for anyone who likes to enjoy legos and the finished product is quite nice. I have the 3 previous kits and now this one on display in my place. It always draws attention when someone comes over for the first time, and not just kids, it also draws in the adults. Dusting them give me an excuse to play with them for a bit with my daughter who is quickly turning into a brick head. Toys like this provide hours of fun and bonding which is lacking in many households now a days. I like how she helps to find a 2x6 plate, or 2x2 tile, and knows what they are by name. I am eagerly awaiting the next modular building.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I usually don't write reviews but when I read reviews that are incorrect I feel obligated to give more valid information.  For the reviewers that say this is not compatible with the new iPad you are simply incorrect.  When you plug this cable into your new iPad it does say that this accessory is not supported.  However, once you click \\"dimiss\\" it works perfectly.  It mirrors what's on your iPad when you're looking at photos or swiping through your home screens.  The only time it doesn't exactly mirror your iPad is when you are watching streaming video from providers such as the Netflix application or the MLB At Bat application.  The video does not show up on your iPad but instead is transferred to your HDTV (as it should).<br /><br />I spoke with an Apple technical rep today to make sure I didn't need to order the new adapter and he said, just as every other HDMI conversation goes..., it's an HDMI adapter so whatever resolution is being streamed to your device will be streamed to the TV as long as it can handle it.<br /><br />So, if you have the new iPad and have never purchased one of these adapters in the past then I would buy the adapter with the model # MD098ZM/A as you will not get the \\"this accessory is not supported\\" message when you plug it in but if you have an iPad2 and bought the cable in the past there is no reason to buy this separate adapter.  The only changes are a locking mechanism on the new cable (which is nice but not for $40) and some other minor adjustments but nothing that has anything to do with the video or audio transfer.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|For $9, this case is fantastic. It's not bulky at all - very sleek. I didn't think I would like the swirl pattern on the back, but it's absolutely fine. I love the fact that you can tell it's a WHITE iPhone. :)
B005MYEPXC|1.0|I saw this film in the theater and loved it. Subsequently saw it on a plane returning from California. Held up. I wanted the blu ray and bought it as soon as it came out. As with others who commented, no dialogue track. I also have a Samsung player and wonder why those who released the blu ray don't have a recall. My friend, who also had this problem, bought the film on DVD and it plays fine. Guess I will have to do the same. Pity as I wanted to see Woody's City of LIghts, come to sparkling life on my blu ray player.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is the first mahjong game I have played and I really enjoy it. Lots of different tile configurations and achievements to collect.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|Game is simple in concept but fun to play. I really enjoyed the levels that make you think.  Other levels tho are just about timing, using trial and error to get the desired result.  Those levels weren't as fun or interesting.
B001K3ENEA|5.0|I bought a pair of these on a Black Friday sale last year and absolutely love them. The bass is not overwhelming but it is sweet and clear. The mid-range and higher ranges are also nicely represented so the sound is very natural.<br /><br />They fit nicely over the ears and are very comfortable to wear. I have several different headphones that I have picked up over the years (my kids tend to borrow and lose or break them) but these are my favorite ones. I do not share these headphones (except with my wife).<br /><br />Unlike a lot of headphones that have sliding adjustment in the headband, the headband on these are permanently fixed at one size, but there is an inner band that adjusts to fit them nicely to your head. The pressure is just right to keep them securely in place while feeling comfortable on the top of the head.<br /><br />The cord is a nice length, so you do not have to sit right next to the audio source.
0375869026|5.0|This is really a story about love and kindness and seeing past the surface to understand and respect every human being, no matter how different they seem. August Pullman goes through such an amazing year of challenges, growth and transition during fifth grade, his first time in a real school (not homeschool), but in spite of sometimes gut wrentching challenges, August (\\"Auggie\\") comes out very much on top, leading his proud and happy mother to say at the end of the book, \\"You really are a wonder, Auggie. You are a wonder.\\"<br /><br />The two most remarkable things that make this story, in my opinion, are, of course August's astonishingly different face, and also his amazingly loving family. August was born with serious birth defects, mainly affecting his face, and has gone through many many surgeries and procedures to improve his health and appearance. Because of all the surgery and health considerations Auggie has been home-schooled and, I might add quite sheltered by his family. The love of the Pullman family is truly beautiful thing, but I actually do think that they over-protected August quite a bit in the first chapters (or, in his life up to the point that they make the decision to have him attend school). I've read a lot of memoirs and watched movies and things about people who have disabilities or children with them, and the successful ones tend to treat that child like s/he is no different from the rest. Or the person gets on with their life not trying to be \\"special\\". So, yeah, Auggie has been pretty sheltered by his mom and dad and even his sister Via, all of whom love him with a fierceness. So, even though he is a wonder of a kid--loving, capable, and brave; he is a bit of a baby in some ways, and he really does a lot of emotional maturing in the course of this book.<br /><br />What a huge thing that must be, though, to know that you look so weird that EVERYONE is startled when they see you, even though many try very hard to hide it. Staring is a big, big issue that August has to deal with all the time. People staring, people pretending not to stare, people staring and pointing, people staring and whispering about him, people avoiding touching or coming near him, even some young kid screaming, or older kids jeering. No wonder he is scared to go to school where so many people will see him all the time.<br /><br />At first, he has only a couple of friends at Beecher Prep, the private school in NYC he attends (he had to go through qualifying entrance exams to get it), and one kid, Julian, a suck-up phony from a very rich family tries to get people to be mean to him. One boy, Jack, hangs around as a friend, but, even intially it was at the request of the school's principal for him to befriend Auggie and show him around. The friendship gets sorely tested. One girl, Summer, is not vainly involved in the schoolgirl cliques and invites August to sit at her table and eat with her, which he does all year. Things get a whole lot worse for Auggie before they get better, and I think the author does a very good job with the part of the story where things really come to a head at the 5th grade nature camp trip, and how that resolves.<br /><br />I also like how the story is told in sections from the vantage point of the different characters. Auggie of course has a lot to say. Next his sister tells her point of view. The author does a great job of describing what it might be for a sibling of a child with many special medical and other needs. She loves August very much and is very loved by her family, but even so she recognizes that their world necessarily revolves around August and his changing needs.  Also, Auggie's friend Jack narrates a section, as well as Via's boyfriend, and Miranda, Via's childhood best friend who has always cherished August, and the girl Summer who befriends August at lunchtime at Beecher Prep. I think this way of writing is a good way to tell the story, as it shows how there are many different ways of looking at this same person, and that he really is a person and not just a face.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewers who recommend that this book should be read and re-read and discussed by young people and people of all ages. It could really help open people's eyes and hearts and minds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OK - So I never thought that I would actually read this book.  After all, it is about teenagers killing other teenagers as part of a national competition that all citizens are required to watch.  But, every month when I was selecting my free Kindle book for the month, The Hunger Games was always at the number one spot.  And every month I would say that I am not going to read that book.  But, there it was - always number one.  It was always taunting me.<br /><br />Then I saw a preview of the movie & I have always enjoyed archery.  So when I was going to download my free book for this month, I decided to take a look at the reviews for The Hunger Games.  Most readers had such high praise for it that I decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />And I am so glad that I did!  I read every single word of this book.  With most books, I skip or rush through portions that don't really move the book along.  And I could not read it fast enough!  Could not wait to get to the next page & find out what happens next.  Looking forward to reading the other two books in the trilogy!  Highly Recommend!!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Great documentary.  It really explains in understandable terms what happened with the banks and why we had so many foreclosures. I never could get what a credit default swap was.  A book that is also very good is \\"The Big Short\\" by Michael Lewis.
B0068MNNOE|3.0|This film has Elizabethan and Shakespearian scholars alike up in arms, because it suggests that the great, learned man known as William Shakespeare may not have written his own plays. I am a scholar of Elizabeth, and I saw it with a scholar of Shakespeare. Both of us were offended... and both of us were impressed.<br /><br />Poet Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) has been dragged into the Tower of London for concealing the politically motivated plays of the late, lamented William Shakespeare. His belief that they have burn down with the Globe Theater sends the audience into earlier times, and the artistic merits of the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans). A man of title but no longer a fortune thanks to his debts and his insistence upon writing, he searches for a name to put with his voice. Ben seems the ideal choice, a poet of little regard and no actual voice, a playwright whose works are of little account. But he is offended at the notion of putting his name to another man's plays and passes the manuscript along to William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), an actor who snatches up the opportunity to become famous. His plays swiftly come to the attention of the aging Elizabeth Tudor (Vanessa Redgrave), who recalls a much earlier time when she was similarly impressed by the Earl's works.<br /><br />Their romance (Joely Richardson, Jamie Campbell Bower) plays out against the political scheming of her advisors, among whom is the hunchbacked Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg). Much later, the Earl of Oxford intends to influence the decision of the queen as to which of her heirs will inherit the throne -- and the play Richard III will incite the peasants against her trusted advisor. What results is a clever blending of actual events and fictitious conclusions. Some of them, like the curiosity surrounding how a man of little learned means could have written such magnificent plays, are valid questions. Others, like the fact that Elizabeth had numerous illegitimate children, stretch the imaginationa bit. But as far as rearranging history goes, it is exceptionally well done and will make you wonder at the end if any of it is possible. My friend began with the assurance that Shakespeare wrote his own plays and concluded wondering if her initial theory is in fact the truth. In that regard, the film is a masterpiece of manipulation, lent an air of seriousness through the early narration of renowned Shakespearian performer Derek Jacobi. But when it comes right down to it, some of the conclusions it draws are far too unbelievable and do no service to my favorite historical monarch.<br /><br />Many have complained that this film is difficult to follow, since it jumps back and forth between three different timelines -- the semi-modern story surrounding the arrest of the poet concealing the literary masterpieces, earlier in his own life as the Earl found a voice for his plays, and as a young man when he was romantically linked to Elizabeth. It does require the audience pay attention but I had little trouble keeping up with events. In all regards, it is an accomplishment of costuming and actor choices. Everyone is magnificent in their respective roles and the dialogue flows with ease. I am curious, however, as to why so much of the score was slight revision on Elizabeth's score.<br /><br />A decent way to reference this film would be \\"intriguing.\\" It leaps to wild conclusions but carries the audience along for the ride. It has a leading man who is unlikable yet we are too fascinated to abandon him entirely. I'm honestly torn in my opinion of it because on one hand, it makes a startling argument and blends history so well that it left even me questioning the motivations behind certain events. But on the other, I hate revisionist history and that is what it is actively engaged in doing, smearing the reputation of Elizabeth I along the way. But as much as it started steam rising over my head, it also entertained me. So what am I left with? Mixed feelings.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|This is based on a true story which you can research on the internet.  It is slow in getting started but if you can be patient it is a very heartwarming story. Because Mr. Straight is an elderly gentlemen with poor vision and no driver's license our hero rides his lawnmower many miles to see his brother who has just had a stroke.  The people he meets along the way restores you faith in humankind. A good family movie.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Opening in the age when Rome ruled the territories from Israel to the coast of Ireland, the film introduces us to the greatest military leader they have ever known, Maximus (Russell Crowe), a man favored by the dying emperor to succeed him in power. Caesar (Richard Harris) believes Rome has been corrupted and knows the people are unhappy with the current government. His desire is to instill a democracy where the senate and elected officials will have more power than the emperor. Maximus is a natural leader. The people follow him without question... if he were able to persuade those in power in Rome of the worth of this ideal, Caesar's dreams of a powerful self-governed nation would come to pass. But his son and heir Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) stands in his way. A power-hungry, mentally deranged young man who has long sought his father's good opinion, the future emperor of Rome is not about to let solitary rule to slip through his fingertips. Commodus murders his father and asks the allegiance of Maximus to the throne. The general scorns him, and is in turn punished. Maximus is taken into the wood to be executed, his family to share the same fate.<br /><br />Managing to escape from his keepers, Maximus flees home... but is too late. His wife and son have been murdered, his fields and harvest burned, his home laid to ruin. Driven by revenge, he vows to avenge their deaths one day. Weak from battle and injury, he's captured by a caravan of slave traders. His new owner intends to use him as a gladiator, to earn favor in the violent sport of Rome. Unwilling to fight in the training duels, Maximus proves himself unbeatable in actual combat. His distaste for this cruel, barbaric practice is evident. In the meantime, Commodus knows the senate plans his removal and entertains the Roman people with the promise of great sport. There will be 63 days of gladiator games in the great coliseum, to honor the memory of his father. Maximus' greatest desire is to fight in those games,and stand before the emperor... so he might deliver the fatal blow.<br /><br />Only one thing stands in his way... the beautiful Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), a former lover and older sister of Commodus. She knows her brother's evil nature, suspects he had a hand in their father's death, and must constantly reject his overly friendly affections. These elements combine into a story that, while theologically is way off, represents the age of Rome excessively well. The magnificent buildings, the violence of the gladiator games, the cheering of the crowd. We have the wronged hero who must fight to survive. The beautiful woman in distress, and the cruel villain, who in key scenes reveals a childlike helplessness. Gladiator won Best Picture, among numerous other awards, and is well worth it. The screenplay is rich with authentic, memorable dialogue. The grand scale and costuming are impressive. The acting is first-rate. Though put into spattering blood a bit, the CGI is incredible. The movie has a slightly sober but moving conclusion.<br /><br />Though having been warned about graphic violence and gore, Gladiator was much less bloody than I anticipated, but still uncomfortably realistic. I am not fond of movies that are violent simply for shock value, and this is not one of them. What it is, is an extremely moving film that shines with the elegant brilliance of a bygone era of filmmaking.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|This review is based simply on the file, not on the books themselves.  This file made my Kindle behave strangely.  Every chapter became a completely different size than the last previous setting, and a page turn sometimes flipped 20 pages ahead or back from where I was.

B007A2O3FO|4.0|Based on a well-known children's book series by Lucy M. Boston, From Time to Time is a sentimental and touching story about ghostly encounters in the aftermath of wartime.<br /><br />Although WWII is drawing to an end, there are still a number of British soldiers unaccounted for -- among them is the father of young Tolly (Alex Etel), who has been sent to live with his grandmother (Maggie Smith) while his own mother attempts to use her political connections to discern his father's whereabouts. Moving into the old manor house, Tolly becomes fascinated with its romantic and frequently tragic history. The paintings in the main hall tell a story of past generations and over a hundred year old mystery. But that is not all the secrets the old house contains, for after a ghostly encounter, Tolly becomes convinced the place is haunted. But it seems to contain more magic than that, for sometimes he encounters specters... and sometimes he is the ghost in their world. Weaving in and out of time, he becomes involved in the lives of the great old family that once lived there...<br /><br />With a mean-spirited son and a blind daughter to look after, not to mention his bored, aristocratic wife (Carice van Houten) feeling neglected, it is all Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) can do to look after his affairs when he is on shore leave. On his most recent trip home he has brought a surprise for his daughter Susan (Eliza Bennett) -- a young Negro boy escaped from slavers, who will become her \\"eyes\\" and her companion. His son Sefton (Douglas Booth) takes an immediate disliking for Jacob (Kwayedza Kureya) but he becomes invaluable to Susan. However, the malicious butler Caxton (Dominc West) is considering how best to be rid of him. Then comes the theft, and the fire, and no one knows the answers, but maybe Tolly, slipping in and out of his own time, can discern the truth before it is too late.<br /><br />Julian Fellowes is best known for Downton Abbey, but his adaptation of the novel is a charming one, and he proves a capable director. Emotion and suspense are present, but he does not distract his audience with peculiar camera angles, merely points them at the actors and allow their performances to shine through. It's quite a good cast -- Timothy Spall and Harriet Walter make notable appearances, but mostly I was impressed with the main characters. Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville are always good, but here we get to see a different side of her, playing a grandmother without a saucy side. Fans of the book may be frustrated with some of the changes made to the story, but as an independent production it's quite engaging, even if it is a little bit of a tearjerker toward the end.<br /><br />Although at times it moves a little slowly and the ending is a tad predictable, I enjoyed this film. It seems more lighthearted in many ways than your customary WWII drama and introduces some wonderful concepts, as well as exploring slightly more mature themes such as forgiveness, acceptance, racism, and coming together in a hard time, with little gusts of humor throughout. To my knowledge, it is not yet available in the United States but I am sure that with such a remarkable cast, it is only a matter of time.a charming one, and he proves a capable director.

B006OCM0G0|4.0|I downloaded this app mostly because I already had Nightclub Story and was enjoying it. I like the variety of items I can make. There is actually a strategy to this game as well, which I wasn't really expecting. Downsides: like others mentioned food can spoil way too quickly and I can see how just clicking through the ads would end up costing the player money. Kindle Fire users can set up permission keys to solve that problem though. Overall, the app works well and is a lot of fun to play
B00028HBKM|4.0|\\"He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, and by his wounds we are healed...\\"<br /><br />The words from Isaiah, written 700 years before the crucifixion, are the only introduction to this remarkable film. On a moonlit night the clouds part and bathe a figure crying out in a garden, his soul wracked with torment, in white light. The man is the Messiah, Jesus, who only days before was welcomed into Jerusalem as a holy man and king. His disciples are asleep nearby, despite his pleadings for them to stay awake and pray with him. From the shadows a figure observes, mesmerizing but evil to the very marrow of his soul. The shadow is Satan and deception and selfishness are his tools as he urges the Christ to give up this road, to let mankind atone for their own sins. But Jesus refuses to submit to the seductive lies of the deceiver and symbolically crushes Satan's pet serpent under his heel.<br /><br />In the Jewish Temple Judas stands before the High Priests. He has been promised thirty pieces of silver for betraying the Christ. The coins scatter around him on the floor and he hastily bends to pick them up. Torches illuminate the night as he leads them to the Gardens to arrest the Messiah. The disciples resist but Jesus comes willingly into the Temple Court. At the moment of his arrest Mary, his mother, awakens in torment, certain something terrible is happening. John has managed to escape and comes to fetch her and Mary Magdalene. They are not allowed inside the counsel but there Jesus is questioned, slandered, spit on, and sent to the Romans in order to plead for his execution. Pontius Pilate's wife Claudia has awoken from a nightmare and begs him not to sentence the \\"king of the Jews\\" to death. But Jesus has been sent to earth to bear the burden of sin for mankind. The penalty is persecution, merciless beating, and eventual crucifixion.<br /><br />One of the most emotionally disturbing but profoundly touching films to come out in a longtime, The Passion of the Christ has arisen great controversy, and for good reason. Between the themes and the brutality, there is a lot not to like... and a lot to appreciate both as a believer, and as a scholar of history. This film is visually stunning to the point of being overwhelming. Its subject matter is extremely dark but mesmerizing. The slow arch of the bag of coins as it flies through the air into Judas' outstretched hand... a close up of Mary Magdalene as Jesus cries \\"It is finished\\"... the tears on her face, the wind slowly caressing her hair... the captivating but disturbing image of Satan watching Jesus flogged nearly to death with great pleasure, holding a child-like demon in his arms. These characters are real. You empathize with the good and hate the bad. For an instant when he first appears you're mesmerized by Satan, wondering if the apparition is an angel... but then you realize the truth. The malice in its eyes, the cold deception of its words. Jesus is someone you instinctively love. You pity Him, feel each of the blows... flashbacks illuminate moments of His extraordinary life. The acting is so good you don't even think about the actors... it's too real. I loved the enhancement on James Caviezel's eyes... they are absolutely spellbinding, full of love throughout torment.<br /><br />Catholics will appreciate the symbolism rampant throughout, as well as nods to traditional Catholic teachings and the writing of Josephus. There are mild deviations from scripture and a few of the writers' additions are unexplained, but the film is one we should all see at least once. If you're a Christian, you need to understand The Sacrifice, and if you're not... you need to understand what we believe.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|I'll start this by saying I'm not an audiophile of any sort.  I did my research before I bought this unit and overall, I don't think you can get better performance for the price and function of the device.  I bought this with a pair of Beyerdynamic DT880 250 Ohm headsets and I planned on initially using it with my iPod touch 4th gen.  I want to first address some confusion that I know is out there about this unit.  You CANNOT use the DAC function of this unit with an iphone/ipod.  The F9 cable I bought with this unit does utilize the 30 pin connector from the ipod and this DOES bypass the crappy internal amp that is in the ipod; however, the F9 cable plugs into the analog input in the E7 unit so your still using the internal DAC of the ipod to process your music.  So that is kinda of disappointing and 1/2 of the star I took off for the review.  The other 1/2 of the star is due to the E7's inability to power the 250 Ohm Beyerdynamic headphones with an ipod connected to the E7 unit.  I just don't think the E7 has the power to push higher impedance headphones properly when using it with an iphone/ipod.  So buyer beware regarding this feature.  There are other spectacular portable DAC/Amps for the iphone/ipod, they are just really expensive!!  There is good news about this device that more than makes up for its disappointing performance with an iphone/ipod.  When you connect this unit to your laptop computer, it bypasses the internal DAC of your computer and you get both functions of the E7.  In the USB configuration, the E7 shines.  There is plenty of power to push by Beyerdynamics and the tones sound great.  I don't use the bass boost in the unit as I use the equalizer in iTunes.<br /><br />The unit is well built for the price.  No plastics for the casing and although the screen isn't very high quality glass, my unit came with a screen cover very similar to the ones available for the ipod/iphone.  The silicone rubber helps protect the casing from scratches which it would get very easily as the casing is just aluminum.  The unit also comes with a shielded USB cable which is nice.  So overall the E7 comes with alot of peripheral goodies for less than $100.  I'm actually considering on buying the E9 unit to use in conjunction with the E7.
B006P0FICE|3.0|Alexandre Dumas' classic story has been told over and over again, but never with quite as much imagination as this. Set in a time of opulence, it features quick-witted assassins, diabolical villains, and flying ships setting sail in stormy skies.<br /><br />Every partnership must eventually end, and it is unfortunate for Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) that it ends with a betrayal by the woman he loves. Lady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) has not only broken his heart but made off with the object of his desire, a set of plans for a flying ship by da Vinci. Her choice to support an English rival Lord Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) over him leaves him devastated. But then, the Musketeers haven't much to do these days, since the youthful and foolish king has no further need of them, and the city of Paris is run by the Cardinal's Guards.<br /><br />Four years later, this does not bode well for young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) when he arrives intent on becoming a Musketeer, with the swordsmanship skills and attitude to prove it. He is not in town for more than an hour before he has collided with Athos, refused to pay a ticket given to him by Aramis (Luke Evans), and insulted Porthos (Ray Stevenson). His intention to fight all three of them in individual duals goes amiss when the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard orders his arrest, leaving the Three Musketeers and their tag-along to stumble into the midst of a diabolical plot intent on catapulting France and England into war. The order of the day is to save the queen, out-maneuver Buckingham, and outsmart the Cardinal (Christoph Waltz)... on the ground, or in the sky.<br /><br />What can I say about this movie? Ten minutes in and I was cringing over how awful it was. Normally, I really like Milla Jovovich, but she is horribly miscast here, lacking any screen presence or chemistry with her costars. Everyone else ranges from decent to mundane, all except for Bloom, who is having such a good time twirling his mustache (sometimes literally) that we cannot help but enjoy his scene-stealing performance. He appears to be fully aware of how absurd the entire thing is, but doesn't mind a bit. Unfortunately, we're expected to root for the budding romance between young DArtagnan and one of the queen's ladies in waiting, but neither of them can act their way out of a paper bag and have zero sexual tension. However, I will say that once you get over the rampant absurdities, this movie does become a lot of fun. Its main flaw is trying too hard and relying on too many gags, but by the midway point I was enjoying myself, and the final twenty minutes are terrific, ranging from the air battle to a swordfight on the roof of Notre Dame.<br /><br />In all other respects, this film is absolutely gorgeous. Shot in real locations rather than sets, it presents us with the finest of French and German architecture, with breathtaking panoramas and exquisite interiors. The costuming is also gorgeous, from ruffled petticoats and underskirts to tailored pantaloons. Now and again a lovely musical score creeps in, and the CGI in the last half is flawless. This film is so stunning on Blu Ray that I'm tempted to forgive its faults for that alone. The cheekiness of this movie is evident from the opening scenes, in which the image freezes and the name of the character is splashed across the frame. Either this kind of silliness is going to hook you in or it isn't. If you are looking for a quality franchise the caliber of Pirates of the Caribbean, this is not it, but if you simply want to be entertained and gawk at some gorgeous costumes, give it a rental. It may not have much substance, but it certainly has style.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I love this game!! it is addicting and super fun. but once I got to a certain number of elements, it made me close out of the game. fix it please!!!
B000QXDED6|3.0|One of the most visually impressive films I have ever seen, 300 is based on a comic book's interpretation of the battle between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B.C.<br /><br />The life of a Spartan is that of a soldier. From infancy, the sons are raised to know and train with the blade, then sent into the wilds to prove themselves worthy of joining the army. That is the story of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who has ruled over Sparta with tremendous strength and courage. But forces are stirring beyond their borders and a messenger comes to inform him that the King of Persia, Xerxes, intends to claim these lands as part of his ever-increasing kingdom. Bolstered in courage by his outspoken wife Gorgo (Lena Headey), the response from Leonidas is to seek the wisdom of the oracle in whether or not to go to war. Corrupt and well-paid by those who would secretly support Xerxes, the oracle's servants warn him against such an action. According to the laws of Sparta, the king cannot take his armies to war without their consent, so he forms a legion of 300 willing men to accompany him as an \\"escort\\" to the mountain pass where the Persians will attempt to enter their shores.<br /><br />There, they engage in fierce combat and one that might put an end to Xerxes' ambitions to conquer Sparta once and for all, little realizing that there is a potential traitor lurking on the outskirts. While this is certainly a testosterone-driven movie and may as such appeal to primarily men, I found much to enjoy about it. The cinematography and backdrops were all computer-animated and while this is apparent, the audience doesn't care because it is so rich and unique to anything we have seen before that it opens our imagination to an entirely new world. I am not often impressed and in this case, I was very impressed -- not only with the visual graphics, but the seamlessness in which the actors are incorporated into it. The costuming is limited but the designers have found way to emphasize the culture through what garments there are. The armor and absence of more than a single garment on most of the men is not historically accurate, but done to underline the principles of their society, which is an emphasis on masculinity. Those intrigued by ancient history will also find it interesting to note that this is the same Xerxes mentioned in scripture (although this one is nine feet tall!).<br /><br />The acting is quite good and so is the hair styling and the make-up, particularly on the servants of the oracle and the hunchback. The music is slightly familiar but wonderfully dramatic and it's easy to like the warriors. But this movie is not for everyone -- there's a fair amount of nudity, sexuality, and gore. The religious symbolism is striking, particularly in the parallels between Xerxes and Satan. Both tempt the hero with fame and riches if they will but \\"bow to me.\\" It's not a happy story by any means but it is inspirational in the sense that it is all about courage. 300 men manage to hold off the entire Persian army with minimal casualties throughout much of the story, proving to the audience that it only takes a few standing for right to make a difference.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|same as the other reviews, I loved it until I got to 28 elements and then force close. fix it plz!!!!
B00406UK7S|3.0|Set in 117 AD, Centurion is a possible explanation for what happened to the infamous missing 9th legion in the Roman Army. Their forces have all but defeated at the hands of the native Scottish warriors known as the Picts, but Rome is not about to release control of a territory without a final attempt. One last courageous stand is made by General Virilus (Dominic West), with the assistance of Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), a recent Pict prisoner who knows something of their tactics. Leading their expedition into the wilds is the beautiful and mysterious mute \\"she-wolf,\\" Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a fierce Pict warrior and remarkable tracker. But when she betrays them to her people and turns on them, only a handful of Romans are left alive. Brick (Liam Cunningham), Bothos (David Morrissey), and the others want to flee across the mountains and rejoin the Roman legion, but in the knowledge that their general is still alive, Quintus insists on mounting a daring rescue operation. When it goes amiss, the men find themselves running for their lives from Etain, who will not stop until she has slaughtered every last one of them.<br /><br />The film is a tad formulaic and the beginning is rough. It jumps around too much in attempting to establish characters and situations, but eventually does settle down and follow a decent narrative. Some have complained about the romantic subplot in the second half, involving a social outcast believed to be a witch (Imogen Poots) but I actually thought that improved the story significantly. In terms of writing the film has some flaws and some high points. Etain is a terrific character and having her never speak a word adds to her sinister element, but at the same time the audience is rather fond of her. Hearing her story gives us a sense of understanding and compassion for her plight... which is actually the main problem in the film. There's no one to root for, since you do not really identify with the Romans but are still hoping they survive. When it comes down to the last brutal fight, you're not sure who deserves to win. Quintus lacks the emotional connection to the audience to make us really care about him, so the film feels empty.<br /><br />I've always thought the lack of a good driving script contributes to a high quota of content, and in this case it is extreme use of gore, which is neither realistic nor remotely believable. There's such a lot of it that the audience rapidly becomes bored by it and the action scenes seem built around it rather than using it as a secondary asset -- it is as if the violence is telling the story. To be honest, I thought the first twenty minutes were terrible -- full of bad acting and sub-par special effects, but the story eventually did take off and hold my attention once the \\"better actors\\" were brought in. The main cast is quite good but we never really get to know these men and as such are not that torn apart in their subsequent trials and sometimes deaths. I also knew what the ending would be fairly early on, so in that sense it is predictable. Overall, it tries to be taken seriously as a big movie but just cannot hold its own.

B002ZG977Y|3.0|Being a god used to come with a certain amount of clout, but now the human race Zeus (Liam Neeson) created with such love has turned against him. They are no longer interested in believing in him, in bowing to his commands, or in sending up the prayers he requires in order to remain strong. His retaliation against one mortal king that stands against him results in the birth of a child, who is set adrift on the high seas and adopted by an unsuspecting fisherman and his wife. Perseus (Sam Worthington) grows up with no knowledge of his parentage or the circumstances surrounding his existence. He lives in a world fraught with peril as mortals and gods engage in massive combat. And there is nothing he can do but watch in horror as Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld, murders his family in one of his rampages in retaliation for the continued defiance of the people of Argos.<br /><br />As punishment for their arrogance, Hades threatens to unleash the mighty Kraken on Athos during the next eclipse, and warns them that there is only one way they can obtain salvation from the beast -- a human sacrifice in the form of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Perseus wants nothing to do with it until a mysterious immortal named Io (Gemma Arterton) reveals to him that he is a demigod, the illegitimate son of Zeus and only he can defeat the Kraken. But first he must journey to the far corners of the world, consult the witches on how to bring it about, pass through the underworld, and do battle with Medusa -- before the eclipse unleashes the wrath of the heavens. When Zeus learns of his existence, he desires to give his son the tools required to carry out his mission, but Perseus desires to have nothing to do with the governing forces that have brought about so much unhappiness -- and his resistance to accepting his destiny might bring about his defeat.<br /><br />One of the first things audiences should know heading into this blockbuster is that it is nothing like the original mythology, something that might disappoint scholars and fans of Greek literature. It is actually a more modern take on a popular movie from many years ago and as such carries the same faults, with a few new ones. I went with my brother, who is a student of mythology, and he was disappointed that so many changes were made to the legends, and that Poseidon is entirely absent, apart from one line of dialogue and limited screen time. I understand their reasons for limiting his presence in terms of budget and keeping the focus on his brothers, but at the same time I would have liked to have seen the god of the seas in action. That point aside, I enjoyed it. There are times when the battle sequences feel a little drawn-out but the magnificent computer effects and exquisite creatures and panoramas more than make up for it. It has an enormous budget and makes the most of it, casting some terrific talent while at the same time not skimping on first-class special effects. Medusa and her head of snakes, the Kraken, the winged horse Pegasus, gnarled and truly hideous witches -- this movie has it all and then some. True, it is a film that wants to carry its audience from one fight to another and so there is not much down time (and as such, not a huge amount of character development) but I expected nothing less.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans may not be epic in terms of being remembered for all time, but it is epic and that at times has to be good enough.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It takes a while to unlock the games, but its fun playing so many different ones!  Some of them are hard and frustrating to play though.
B0012Q732O|3.0|Roland Emmerich has a style of movie making that is very impressive. Even when I don't love the project, it is usually pleasing to the eye and leaves me with something to think about. 10,000 BC is his most recent project and while it is not his best work, it is one of the most unique and memorable.<br /><br />Mammoths are a way of life for the people of the small village in the midst of the ancient wilds. They provide food, clothing, and opportunities for trade with neighboring tribes. But in recent years their presence has become more scarce and thus far more valuable. They are also extremely dangerous and almost impossible to kill except in massive hunting parties. D'Leh (Steven Strait) is far from the best huntsman among his people. He's also something of an outcast since his father abandoned him and the village many years before. But he does have the eye of the beautiful Evolet (Camilla Belle). But she is destined to be the wife of the best hunter among them... and it's not likely to be him. Until fortune changes and by sheer dumb luck, he manages to kill a mammoth all by himself, something that earns him the right to brandish the white spear and choose his bride. Too humble to accept the spear under false pretenses, he mourns that he will never marry Evolet...<br /><br />The grandmother of the tribe has professed that four-legged demons will come into their midst and take away something precious. That very night, foreign tribesmen on horseback steal into the community and make off with what they can carry, including D'Leh's beloved Evolet, since her blue eyes are rare. Along with a handful of his friends, D'Leh sets out to save her and his trek through the wilds that lay over the mountains will take him to more dangerous places than he could have ever envisioned.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of movies set in prehistoric times but this one is surprisingly good for the genre. It does ask you to suspend your belief on many occasions but is depicted as a sort of ancient grand adventure, complete with saber tooth tigers, wooly mammoths, and cavemen so ragged and filthy that you know they must smell even worse. What actually amazed me the most was that underneath ragged dreadlocks and a bucket full of dirt, Camilla Belle can still be outstandingly gorgeous -- maybe even more so due to Evolet's uniquely blue eyes. She isn't just a throwaway heroine either but has some spunk, which she needs as she carries her half of the story on with the tradesmen. The animation is flawless and the creatures look fairly realistic (although they seem to be about twice as big as history tells us they were). It is something of a sprawling epic so don't expect to see just wild lands... there is a towering city complete with an evil \\"god\\" and lots of sinister minions.<br /><br />This film presents a very noble and moral set of ethic guidelines that implies that in order to survive, a civilization must be governed through forces of good rather than an interest in evil. Heroism is applauded, evil abhorred. And that is a good thing in our modern age.

B003EYVXXW|2.0|Hollywood has a long history of misrepresenting historical events -- altering timelines and characters, changing motivations, and injecting an alarming amount of anti-Christian prejudice. Agora is no different, a film that approaches a fascinating historical figure without a shred of respect for what actually happened.<br /><br />The Library of Alexandria holds the most precious philosophical works in the world, and among its many admirers and protectors is the beautiful philosopher Hypatia (Rachel Weisz). A student of progressive thought, an instructor in philosophy and science, and obsessed with circles and their relation to the movement of the earth, Hypatia is much loved by her students and colleagues alike. One of her most ardent admirers is Orestes (Oscar Isaac), who hopes to inspire her to marry him -- but in doing so she would lose her independence and fall beneath his influence, meaning she would be forced to fall silent and no longer teach. Hypatia is convinced he does not love her for her mind as much as for her body and rejects him, not realizing as she does so that her world is about to be torn apart. Christianity has spread throughout Alexandria now that it is no longer illegal and in the wake of slaughtering Christians defacing Pagan statues in the central square, a mob descends upon the great Library with the intention of burning its contents.<br /><br />Caught up in the midst of this religious fervor is Hypatia's slave Davus (Max Minghella), who is also in love with her -- but cannot tell her as much, for it is forbidden and inappropriate. A Pagan who has converted recently to the new faith, Davus abandons her and joins the mob, finding his calling while at the same time questioning the motives of the Christians that surround him. In later years, the violence between the Pagans and Christians and also the Jews will escalate into inescapable pandemonium, resulting in a bloodbath. Where the film succeeds is in the strength of its characters -- each ofthem are interesting and likable in some sense, even though some make poor decisions. Our heart goes out to Davus when he offers to take a flogging for a female servant who admits to professing the Christian faith. He is not religious then, but becomes more so later on. Hypatia is a spunky heroine and in some sense easy to identify with, both in her yearning to discover truth and her resistance toward submitting to the men around her. Orestes appears at first to be something of a jerk but eventually we discover that his love for her is genuine -- and he risks his life in defending her honor. Another figure, this one first a student and then later a Bishop in the Church, comes across as adhering to the teachings of Christ at least -- compassionate, forgiving, and respectful to Hypatia.<br /><br />On a purely cinematic level this film works in a lot of ways and fails in others -- minor characters are not well developed and many of them look so much alike that for awhile I didn't know who anyone was; the story likewise seems to have no internal focus, since it cannot decide what its story is really about -- or what it wants to say about its characters. It is part romance (that never goes anywhere), part historical fiction (rather than fact), part adventure, and partly a push for science and philosophy while at the same time denouncing religion. Its underlining message is that philosophy unites and inspires whereas faith divides and incites violence. Furthermore, it throws Christians to the forefront of controversy and depicts them poorly, while disregarding the actual historical events. In the film, they intend to burn the library, presumably to put a stop to free thought and philosophy -- in reality, the Library of Alexandria did not exist in that time period; it had fallen into disrepair and been destroyed years earlier. In its place was a Pagan temple that a Christian mob sacked in return for their Churches having been defaced by Pagans.<br /><br />The film paintsHypatia as an atheist or agnostic, her fundamental faith only in philosophy -- in truth, she was a Pagan. It misrepresents her friendship with a Bishop -- implying he abandons and speaks ill of her, when in reality she ceased corresponding with him and never told him why, although he continued to speak highly of her and admire her tremendous mind. It also claims her death was religious, when in fact it had everything to do with politics. The director makes very conscious decisions to imply that Christians of Alexandria were actually comparable to the Nazis.<br /><br />The costumes and acting are without a doubt marvelous, but that it so deliberately maligns the facts in an attempt to misrepresent actual events and place blame where it is unwarranted displeases me very much -- and I am not the only one to be offended by it, as various atheists have also proclaimed their disappointment as well.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is an amazing book about an amazing experience. I am moved, touched and grateful for having read this story about a wonderful life of healing.<br /><br />All I can really say is... I'm planning on living fearlessly. Thank you!
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|There is really only one film franchise out there that continually has me salivating for more, and that's the gritty, paranormal reality of \\"Underworld.\\" While shorter than the other installments in the series, \\"Awakening\\" is one of the finest installments yet.<br /><br />Where once vampires and lycans lived in secret, the war between them has escalated and the truth is out. In a desperate attempt to maintain the upper hand, humans have enforced martial law and are hunting down both species, identifying it as a \\"virus\\" without a cure. Their assault on the two races that have lived among them unnoticed for centuries forces individuals on both sides into hiding, but before Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and her hybrid lover Michael (Scott Speedman) can escape, they are hunted down. Twelve years later, awakening from stasis in a laboratory, Selene is determined to find out what has happened to Michael -- and to discover the source of her hallucinations, which permit her to see through another creature's eyes. Her desperate escape introduces her to David (Theo James), a member of one of the few remaining Covens, and then to the little girl that both humans and lycans seem to want -- Eve (India Eisley).<br /><br />After she is badly wounded during a lycan attack, David takes them both to the Coven -- much to the disapproval of his father (Charles Dance), little realizing the consequences this will have for them all. If you have any familiarity with the franchise, you will know what this series is all about: the battle between vampires and lycans (werewolves) as it evolves in a futuristic society. The most successful installments have revolved around Selene and although I was not keen on the idea of this film back when it was announced (to be honest, I was disappointed they didn't make another prequel showing the rise of Lucian), the end result is marvelous. Changing the backdrop and introducing Eve could have backfired but it doesn't; we accept that the world has altered and are still rooting for our leather-clad immortal heroine to save the day in whatever way she can. And in this one she does, with her usual flair and undoubted style. Everything we loved about the earlier films is present here, from the jaw-dropping action sequences to the twirl of her coat as she kicks some lycan butt.<br /><br />Even though it is violent, there's a lot to like about this film series and this film in particular. It explores an alternate reality in which the heroine is unconventional, a vampire seeking to protect her own from a lycan clan that would gladly kill Eve to harvest her abilities. I'm also fond of its consistent use of talented British actors in the roles of vampire elders -- in the original and the prequel we had Bill Nighy, in the sequel we had Derek Jacobi, and now we have Charles Dance. Throw in an incredible remix of an Amy Lee Evanescence track over the ending credits and you have a movie series that may not strive to be intelligent, but it is always entertaining. But putting all that aside, its immense success comes down to one rather trivial truth: it's just plain cool.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I completely loved this book!! I normally don't like 1st person books or books with annoying characters so I went into this half expecting it to be one of those - but boy oh boy! it's an easy read, lots of laughs (i admit I even cried in one or two (or three-eck!) parts) and i read the ending twice i loved it so much (which is a first for me!)<br />Absolutely loved it :)<br />xxxxxxxxxxx
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|George R.R. Martin's bloodthirsty fantasy novels have found their home on HBO in Game of Thrones. An epic, sprawling story full of memorable characters and sinister events, it quickly sweeps you up into its complicated world while reminding you that not all fantasy is as innocent as Narnia.<br /><br />White walkers have not been seen in centuries, but the Guardians of the Wall fear their return with the approaching winter. Summer has lasted for ten years and the cold is coming. But of more immediate concern is the news that the King's advisor has died, and he comes to Winterfell to invite Lord Stark (Sean Bean) the position, much to the concern of Lady Stark (Michelle Fairley), who fears her husband's absence will mean misfortune for them all. King Baratheon's presence in the northern kingdom brings unease when his wife Cersei (Lena Headey) is discovered by Lord Stark's son as having a \\"special relationship\\" with her twin brother Jamie (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). The boy is thrown from an upper window and the family is left to deal with the horrific consequences.<br /><br />Lord Stark's illegitimate son Jon (Kit Harrington) travels north to take the black cloth and become a Guardian of the Wall, and strikes up an unlikely friendship with Cersei's older brother, Tyrion (Peter Dinklage). Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, the official heir to the throne is seeking out means of reclaiming his kingdom. Viserys (Harry Lloyd) has arranged a marriage between his sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) to Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), a chieftain lord who has promised to help him reclaim his throne. But as the two armies prepare for war and unravel a shocking plot of betrayal and murder, an ancient evil rises in the north...<br /><br />In purely cinematic terms, Game of Thrones is a masterpiece. It creates a fascinating and dangerous world in which an unforgettable cast of characters dwell. Some we love, and others we love to hate, but none of them leave us with a lack of emotion. The detail and setting is immaculate and the cast is incredibly strong, ranging from the big-screen names mentioned here to later appearances by such individuals as Aidan Gillen, whose character proves more interesting than most, the lynchpin that drives all, a clever man who is more than he seems (one early prophetic line of dialogue has him telling Lord Stark, \\"not trusting me was the wisest thing you have done since you got off your horse\\") and Charles Dance. But the tagline of this series is \\"don't get too attached,\\" and that proves true: in these stories, no one is safe and before the end, some of our favorite characters will die.<br /><br />Sean Bean is the main driving force of this first season, and arguably its strongest point. This is assisted by the fact that he is the \\"leading character\\" but it is hard not to come to love him for the smaller things, such as the pride he takes in watching his youngest daughter learn to handle a sword. He is also one of the few truly \\"good\\" men involved, since elsewhere we have fornicators, rapists, warlords, and pimps. Unfortunately, the fantastic storytelling comes with a heavy dose of violence, sex, and nudity, along with the not-so-occasional f-word. Sometimes, it is to further the plot, but most of the time it is simply there to be controversial. In certain ways, for me at least, it also diminished the overall experience.<br /><br />I cannot say that this series is enjoyable, because in many ways it is heart-wrenching, but it creates a unique world that I have never experienced before but am eager to experience again, and that in of itself is a remarkable accomplishment.
B000RF1QDS|5.0|I told my father some of the story behind the movie and he wanted to see it after that. So Amazon of course was my source! I knew I'd find the DVD there. Sure enough I did and had it shipped to my dad. Can't wait until he watches it. Great stroy!
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|When Homer wrote the classic story of forbidden love and great folly, he never envisioned it would become a classic. Comprised of a fantastic cast and magnificent sets, Troy tries very hard to cover up its flaws. Its an interesting story but fails on many levels. It doesn't have the strong storyline and moral foundation of The Patriot. It doesn't have the driving passion of Gladiator. What Troy turns out to be is a humble attempt at romance without great conviction in a tale of characters we have trouble completely rooting for. They are all flawed and human, but not remarkable. By the end were not sorry to have seen it, just sorry that it wasn't better.<br /><br />King Agamemnon has been moving his armies throughout the empire, conquering one land after another. The only freestanding province remaining is Troy, seat of the high king Priam (Peter O'Toole), whose two sons have been sent to decree peacetime. Working for Sparta is a brutal warrior named Achilles (Brad Pitt), a soul born to kill men. He fights not for the empire but out of desire for glory. His mother (a briefly seen Julie Christie) acknowledges his wish for notoriety but warns him it will bring his death, foreseeing inevitable conflict on the battlefield. While in Sparta, Paris (Orlando Bloom), younger Prince of Troy, falls in love with the kings beautiful wife Helen (Diane Kruger). They conduct a clandestine affair in which both are convinced they have found true love. Paris is due to return to his homeland and begs Helen to accompany him.<br /><br />When Menelaus learns his wife has fled with Paris, he desires to declare war and gain the return of his wife so he can kill her with my own two hands. Agamemnon has been awaiting just such an opportunity, an excuse to attack the nation of Troy and bring it to its knees. Paris older brother Hector (Eric Bana) warns Paris against the folly of bringing home another mans wife, but has not the heart to send him to his death. Paris has promised, if Helen is returned to her husband, to follow her there, even if it means his certain execution. When they return to Troy, their father welcomes them with open arms, also extending his protection to his son's lover. When the Spartans arrive and Priam refuses to sacrifice Helen, they attack the beach of Troy. Inevitably it will bring others to war on their fair shores, including Odysseus (Sean Bean) and Achilles, who finds forbidden love in the form of the kings niece Briseis (Rose Byrne).<br /><br />While the story begins solidly, it loses momentum midway through. The battles have no excitement because neither army battles for anything worth fighting for. Paris wants to keep Helen at no great cost to himself. He has noble intentions of saving Troy but fails when it counts and shows cowardice. The story revolves around Helen, but she's barely given any screen time. Achilles is supposed to be likable but comes across as more of an arrogant, bloodthirsty jerk. Hectors wife (Saffron Burrows) has the most empathetic role but not enough character development. The two noblest of characters are needlessly killed for sport. When you leave the theatre thinking all involved were foolish for not trying to sort out pointless differences, the movie has failed to do its job. These men died for nothing. There was no cause for them to battle for, nothing but lust, pride, and greed. A king took an army to war because he wanted to rule the earth. Another fought for revenge over a common, simple mistake. None of it was honest heroism, just macho displays of vengeance.<br /><br />Despite this, the film is very engaging at times, and many of the characters are enjoyable to watch. Hector and his beautiful wife, Paris internal struggles with cowardice, the grief of his father, even Achilles unusual character alterations. In one scene he's a warring madman, in another he's weeping for a fallen enemy. He says it is senseless to go to war and believes loss of life is terrible but deep down feeds his bloodlust. Its an impossible conflict of interest, an attempt to humanize a character you simply cannot root for. He does show great kindness to Briseis (even though he eventually seduces her) by allowing her to live, offering her freedom, and fighting for her protection on numerous occasions from Spartans. This aspect makes him much more likable, although when he ties the body of a fallen foe behind his chariot and races it through the encampment, some of our liking for him fades.<br /><br />Because of this, as well as some lengthy pacing issues and an abominable soundtrack (all except for the closing song by Josh Groban) Troy is not very memorable. There are few remarkable aspects. The costuming is very rich and the acting is quite good. The leading cast, particularly Peter O'Toole are all very convincing. The problem then becomes an issue of which side to root for. The movie tries so hard to be fair to both sides that they alienate the audience. If the story were only about Helen and Paris, we could root for Helen and Paris. Instead were given glimpses into not only their romance, but Achilles relationship with his impressionable young cousin, his romance with Briseis, Priam's concerns for Troy, Homer and his wife, and the King of Spartans plans to rule the world. It would have been better to follow one or two threads. Characters also die out rapidly; some of the most beloved heroes fall beneath the blade, as well as the bad guys.<br /><br />Its entertaining and interesting but not quite gripping enough to forgive its flaws. Worth seeing once if you're a fan of the cast, but not a classic, and certainly has nothing to teach other than that mankind can be utterly cruel and foolish. That's the true tragedy of Troy.

1853261580|5.0|The little prince is a magnificent spiritual journey which sweeps the reader away. It is in a way a story which connects mankind to the galaxy hence to the universe. A brilliant metaphor, through the eyes of a little prince one can find the dreamy sides of life. The desert is related to the universe and to eternity, and the little prince is what the reader just wants to become. After reading this story for so many times I never got tired of it. On the contrary, the little prince is a story that can be read time after time after time, and each time there is another detail that sweeps the heart away. By far out one of the best classic stories ever written.

I was sad with a lot of the people that were killed off in the book but the ending satisfied me.<br /><br />There were lots of twists and turns in the story, I think it ended perfectly. It ended with a damaged world working towards recovering which is always what happens during a time of war.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow, i'm not into reading...or at least I didn't think I was much into reading.  I started reading this series 48 hours ago and have now finished the first two books...AND i'm in the middle of nursing school so thats saying something!!  I am totally in love with Ana and Christian.  This book has caused me to revamp my \\"inner goddess.\\"  Its renewed me sexually and I feel like I have more self confidence...i'm serious.  This probably all sounds silly...but this book greatly affected me.  I have hardly slept or eaten since starting the first one.  Its very refreshing to read about the passion and compassion shared between these two.  I can not WAIT for this to be made into a movie...will it be?  I keep trying to figure out who should be cast as Christian...he'd be a difficult role to play.<br /><br />Anyway, long story short...READ THESE BOOKS.  They are HOT.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This angry birds is probably the best one since the original. I cannot believe how much fun it was just in the first few levels.<br />Rovio did a perfect job with adding gravity to the game. It gives it a new twist and a new type of challenge. I also enjoy the fact that you can now see where your bird is going, but like other reviews said, it doesn't make it easier.<br />This game is definitely worth the $3 and the HD looks great on the kindle fire.
0307361071|4.0|Harry Hole is back; not quite the same Harry Hole,he is grittier, more cynical and less hopeful; the warmth at his core and his core values have cooled. Its incredibly realistic given what our reluctant hero has gone through however the book isnt quite as minutely detailed as some earlier books and is more visually aware, a few key action points clearly cinematic. But then Oslo has changed over the decade Harry's story has been told.<br />Great mix of detective story (Stunning twist at the end as usual, can't write anymore without spoiling), social commentary on the evils of drug misuse and the juxtaposition of new wealth versus old values in Norway.<br /><br />Will there be another Harry Hole novel? I hope so but fear there may not be!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I tried to read this book once before but the beginning was very boring, so I gave it another chance and I am glad I did.<br />This book is extremely well written. You will fall in love with the characters and hope that nothing bad happens to them. The twist in the end shocked me, and I'm not easily shocked. The story line is very entertaining. There is not a boring part in this book except for the first chapter, and once you get past it you never even notice it happened.<br />Steig Larsson created a masterpiece that will live forever and I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read or a new series to start.
1451627289|4.0|Captivating story and intriguing.  But sometimes I have a problem keeping my interest when I find factual errors.  Oh, nothing of note and nothing that affects the story.  I realize that sports are not King's forte, but certain errors are a bit distracting.  He refers to The Dallas Texans as a team that will eventually become \\"America's team\\" aka The Dallas Cowboys..uh, The Texans moved from Big D and became The Kansas City Chiefs..at the time that the story supposedly took place Dallas had two teams.  A bookie tells him to bet on the Bears to win the NFC.  Uh, the NFC did not exist in 1963..it came about in 1970 as a result of the AFL/NFL merger.  He mentions a basketball team called the Dallas Spurs.  While The Dallas ABA basketball team eventually became the San Antonio Spurs, they were known as The Dallas Chaparrals before the move south..furthermore they did not exist before 1967.  I'll give him some literary leeway for the bet on a fight that never took place (Dick Tiger's loss to Tom Case)..Just find these things distracting and wish that he had done a little more research.  Being overly picky?  Yeah, I probably am.  But when an author fails to research smaller details such as this..ya gotta wonder how extensive his research was on things more relevant to the story.  My only other problem with this book is that he took between 800 and 900 pages to tell a story that could have been told in 500 to 600 pages without compromising the plot and without so much unnecessary filler.  A pretty good read even so.  Might be a fairly decent movie if handles right.

B007G5K066|4.0|Let's face it: if you honestly believe the world of British secret intelligence is as exciting and titillating as a James Bond film, you aren't going to like TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY.  In reality, as author John le Carre could tell you, it's more of a waiting game: mundane activities backed but a sense of dread and anticipation.  TINKER captures this atmosphere perfectly, as master spy George Smiley comes out of retirement to track down a high-ranking KGB mole.<br /><br />Atmosphere is key here.  Tomas Alfredson perfectly captured growing dread in his previous effort, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  He continues his efforts here, working from an Oscar-nominated script by Brigdet O'Connor and Peter Straughan.  Aiding him are some of the best British character actors of our time: Toby Jones, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Simon McBurney.  The anchor here is Gary Oldman, giving what is infamously his first Oscar-nominated performance.  Oldman's Smiley is proper and polite, superficially harmless; but as the movie progresses, and Smiley closes in on his prey, he becomes more and more dangerous.  It's a subtle progression, and one only an actor of Oldman's caliber (calibre?) could pull off.<br /><br />TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY isn't for everyone.  It isn't a great film; like its source novel, it's a bit complex and dense (viewers will need two or three attempts to figure out everything that's going on), and casual viewers will be put off by the lack of action, and the overall \\"British-ness\\" of the film (yeah...it's a shame, but you know it's gonna happen).  Still, for those interested in a spy thriller that could actually happen, and those looking for great performances and mastery of atmosphere, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a must-see.

B004RRVHCW|5.0|As a sometimes casual, sometimes obsessive fan of Sonic Youth (I go through phases like a madman), I feel that 'Demolished Thoughts' contains some of the most strikingly original songs of Thurston's career, both solo and with Sonic Youth.<br /><br />It's somewhat similar to the first half of Thurston's '07 album, 'Trees Outside the Academy,' in that it's a mostly acoustic, string-laden album of pretty mind-bending tunes that are also extremely melodic and even infectious at times. But while 'Trees' contains a few songs that rank up there with his very best work of all-time, 'Demolished Thoughts' is, imo, a more consistent set of top-notch tunes, even if it never quite reaches the same heights.<br /><br />These songs really showcase Thurston's guitar-playing skills, proving him to be one of the best, most original practitioners of the instrument of the last couple decades. I love the fact that his acoustic guitar is so up front in the mix that you can actually hear his fingers sliding up and down the fretboard at times, thanks to producer Beck Hansen. Combine his angular, frenetic playing and songwriting-style with violins, a harp, percussion, bass, etc., and it all adds up to one of the top two or three albums of the year.<br /><br />It's hard to sight specific highlights, as each song weaves into the whole so seamlessly that it seems almost wrong to divide it into individual tracks here. I will say that listening to 'Demolished Thoughts' took me on one of the most intense, at times even overwhelming, musical journeys I've been on in a really long time, and has catapulted Thurston back into my \\"All-Time Favorite Artists/Musicians\\" list. And for good this time. This album also proves that he has not run out of things to say, even after a 30-plus year career. For that, we should all be grateful.
B004WR125O|5.0|Recently got the Onkyo TX-NR609 receiver and needed something for wireless access and got this thingamajig.<br /><br />Our router is in an upstairs bedroom and is seperated from the receiver by a couple walls, subfloor and closed doors, maybe 30-35 feet away. At generally 42% strength, we have no problems with connection to online radio. Never heard of Slacker radio before, but, modern blues rocks the surround now. Pandora also comes in flawlessly.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze manually. Make sure to enter the correct key code for your router and you should be golden. We have a ten digit code on our router and it works, it's flat wrong about only 8 digit codes being allowed. Hard to understand the negative reviews on the UWF-1, as they almost prevented us from purchasing this. I'm throwing away the box and manuals that came with it. It's a best buy, seriously!<br /><br />p.s.  Check out the modern blues on Slacker radio. Not repetitive, only awesome music... Both thumbs up, for Onkyo and Slacker...
B003IWZ1D8|4.0|One of my favorite movies.  Alas, I wanted to visit the kitchen for a fresh drink about 20 minutes in, and I made the fatal mistake of hitting PAUSE.  When I returned, I saw a blue Universal screen & no matter what button I pushed, I was forced to start all over again, go thru every initial menu choice, select a chapter, then fast forward until I could find where I'd left off.  This pissed me off, killed my buzz, and made no sense.  I finally relocated where I'd left off & watched the rest of the movie, not daring to go pee.<br /><br />I then turned to the extras and watched the Truffaut/Hitchcock exchange, got my subtitles set, but about 4 minutes in I could wait no longer.  The bathroom beckoned.  So, convincing myself that I must've hit the wrong button before, I paused again, but when I returned, the same thing happened.  I had to start all over, go through each step of each menu, then fast forward until I found the spot where I'd stopped watching, reset the subtitles -- thankfully, I'd been suspicious enough to notice the elapsed time before I went to pee.<br /><br />Sorry, but this is kind of a big deal.  It's insulting for Universal to peddle a product so user-UNfriendly that I can't even pause a blu-ray video & start up where I left off two minutes later.  In what century was this product released?

1400069289|4.0|The KEY to living is working on HABITS. This I learned from this book. For that reason, I recommend this work, highly.<br /><br />However, Charles Duhigg is an interesting writer, but he is not a psychologist. He takes the reader all over the map in search for solutions and he left me with a sense of confusion and hopelessness. He ends with (Appendix):<br /><br />\\"The difficult thing about studying the science of habits is that most people, when they hear about this field of research, want to know the secret formula for quickly changing any habit...If only it were that easy. It's not that formulas don't exist, The problem is that there isn't one formula for changing habits, there are thousands.\\"<br />=========================================================<br />One idea that came to mind, after reading the \\"Power of Habit\\", concerns work. Imagine that changing a habit is about a work pattern. If you want to quit smoking, you might imagine that you are paid to smoke, at work. Then, the boss tells you to switch to some other activity, instead. Your work now involves another ROUTINE. It is your job, your work, to change your habit.<br /><br />Duhigg brings this out in discussing the \\"Habits of Successful Organizations\\". He discusses Alcoa with safety, and Starbucks with customer relations. What he does not do is tie this back to the habits of the individual, alone. We could imagine that each person is a company of one, and he then can put his habits to work.<br />=========================================================<br />I would say that the author missed the boat in coming up with remedies for changing habits. As a writer, he has the habit of rambling on and on, with amazing stories and facts, but in the end he has not logical conclusion, no amazing insights for making and breaking habits. Perhaps, another book or a second edition can focus on simple cures.

0062060554|1.0|This should not have an average of four stars, which is why I'm reviewing it. When writing you are supposed to look through the eyes of your characters. Think about this. If you can't remember anything and therefore you are reading a journal that you wrote to tell yourself about your life, after reading 'I just woke up and don't remember anything about my life' or some variation of it. Would you really start your next entry the same way. After reading it twice, would you think that you need to remind yourself a third time that you woke up not remembering anything knowing that is what you will be experiencing the next day away. If I read my own journal and noticed that I kept repeating the same thing over and over again, I'd make a point to quit talking about that one thing as it is getting me nowhere. And I don't read my journal daily or right before I make my next entry.<br /><br />That is the thing that really bothered me. She doesn't have all the time in the world to read her journal. If she can't trust Ben she needs to know why. Why would she make it that much harder on herself by read all the following then making a new entry that starts the same way as all the ones previous to it.<br /><br />Beyond that. Books are not real life in the part that you are supposed to cut out the boring parts. We know after the pointless prologue that she doesn't remember things from one day to the next. Having her over and over again be shocked by it while your readers are wanting to know the story is boring. We don't need to be told twelve times she can't remember things from one day to the next. And he mentions it a lot more than that.<br /><br />Which means, yea she should have trouble maneuvering in her very different environment, but there is no reason to keep telling us why. And certainly not take paragraphs to remind us why.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My Neighbor Totoro is my favorite Hayao Miyazaki film most days, but Spirited Away is on the same level. It's the best animated film ever to win an Oscar.<br /><br />So what elevates it from other great animation such as Pixar? It's a combination of many things.<br /><br />Miyazaki's animation feels different to anything else that I've experienced. It's detailed and complex, with well-developed characters, and it has heart. He creates lovable characters, but some have human flaws and they are more real than characters found in most animated fare.<br /><br />Spirited Away tells the story of a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro (Chase). Her parents are driving her to their new home and she's upset about leaving her friends behind. In fact, she's bratty and whines a lot. Her father drives down the wrong road and they end up in an abandoned amusement park. Although it's deserted, they can smell food. Chihiro's parents decide to take advantage of a free meal, but Chihiro doesn't. She's horrified to see them transform into pigs.<br /><br />While she is deciding what to do, a boy named Haku (Marsden) shows up and urges her to leave before it gets dark. She refuses to leave her parents so he decides to help her. Darkness brings a few changes and spirits appear. An area which appeared to be deserted is suddenly alive with light and chatter. Haku explains to Chihiro that she will never be allowed to leave unless she earns her place in the town. To do so, she must seek employment at the bath house.<br /><br />The bath house is run by Yubaba (Pleshette) and she's a formidable witch. But, with the help of Kamaji (Stiers), who takes care of the boiler, Chihiro is given a chance to find a job. She's assigned to Lin, who shows her what to do. Lin also tries to toughen Chihiro up and teach her to improve her sullen attitude and learn some manners. Spirited Away is a coming-of-age story in which Chihiro eventually becomes a happy, confident girl, capable of facing anything.<br /><br />The story is vast and quite complex for an animated film. Miyazaki doesn't rush things and takes a little over two hours to show Chihiro's story. It's aimed at an older audience than films such as Ponyo and My Neighbor Totoro, but it contains some of the beauty and innocence that's present in all Studio Ghibli films.<br /><br />Miyazaki's imagination is almost limitless. You'll meet witches, soot sprites, dragons, spirits, weird animals and a giant baby. I've sometimes heard people complain that they don't understand the story. If you just accept it as a fantasy where magic exists, it's really pretty easy to follow.<br /><br />The style of animation may be different from anything that you are used to. The image is two-dimensional and each frame looks like a watercolor painting. But take note of the amount of detail present in each frame. Some of it doesn't need to be there for the story to work, but it's a richer experience because it is present. When Chihiro nervously edges down a steep flight of stairs, look at the detail in the individual steps. When she puts her shoes on, there's a very human gesture that most animators wouldn't bother with. Spirited Away is clearly a labor of love and a work of art.<br /><br />If you give the film a try, you might find yourself hooked after about two minutes as I was. The look of the film and Joe Hisaishi's score set a mood immediately and draw you in. It's a slightly darker and more dangerous world than many Studio Ghibli settings, but you'll be reluctant to leave.e story is vast and quite complex for an animated film.

The author does a great job explaining the science behind food.<br /><br />I know a lot of engineers that enjoy cooking more when they understand the mechanics behind cooking, and the chemical reactions that occur with food.<br /><br />This book also covers a bit of the differences that people have with their tasting capabilities.  I never thought much about how genetic tasting abilities affect the foods we choose.  We don't all taste alike, and these differences in tasting affect the foods that different nationaities choose.<br /><br />This is an amazing book to read if you want an in depth understanding of cooking.

1579128149|5.0|The book arrived in an AWESOME time and I found it incredibly interesting! Somehow for some reason, Theodore Grey managed to make chemistry interesting. I brought the book to my chemistry class and everybody had a read. The book is incredibly modern looking and applies to my agegroup (teenager). The wording is incredibly light and easy to read and gives a basic insight into each element. The information displayed describes the most interesting aspects of each element. The boiling point, density and electron configuration is clearly displayed enable easy analysis and visual appeal. The information of periodic groups at the front puts it all in perspective for the reader. With awesome photography and it all on black, the book is highly visually appealing. Plus, the rip-out photographic periodic table of elements at the end is incredibly useful! The price of this book is incredibly cheap considering it is a hard cover. Most other books of this type are 80 bucks plus! Can't reccomend enough!

B006JTS5OO|5.0|After what seemed like a lifetime without anything up to their usual standards coming from the Muppets (even their attempt at a Muppet Wizard of Oz film was somehow botched), a very serious fan approached Disney Studios with a desire to make a movie that would restore the fantastic, felt funnymen to their former glory. That man was actor Jason Segel (\\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\"), and that film would come to be known as \\"The Muppets\\".<br /><br />The plot initially sounded like a bad idea. The Muppets have to reunite to put on a show in order to save the Muppet Studios from a greedy oil tycoon who wants to tear it down for drilling. Seemed like something we'd seen a hundred times before, even in \\"It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie\\", let alone the Blues Brothers\\". But, hey, that's sort of the joke. Even the oil tycoon here is played as a complete parody of the greedy businessman villain role, and in this film, it all works! The plot, of course, is meant to harken back to those old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland \\"let's put on a show\\" classics, Mickey even doing one of the many brief celebrity cameos in the film. It's all very nostalgic and charming, which is a big part of what this film means to be and achieves wonderfully. This movie is about the Muppets, and putting on a show is what they do best. It's also a very smart film about reclaiming something you've lost while still staying true to yourself and what you love. It's about not giving up, but trying your best and facing the outcome either way. And, to be totally blunt, it's about how The Muppets lost their fame and how they try to gain it back. And, in a way, the film makes its own true story.<br /><br />To get into detail here, Walter is a puppet born into a human family (no, we don't see how). His human brother Gary (Jason Segel) is also his best friend. Growing up, Walter was clearly a bit different, and this was a struggle for him until he discovered the original Muppet Show. Walter and Gary became big fans, but especially Walter. Kermit was his hero. After we see this bit of Gary and Walter history, we come to present day, in which Walter and Gary are adults, and Gary is planning to propose to his girlfriend, Mary (the beautiful and adorable Amy Adams), on an anniversary trip they are taking to Los Angeles. Mary is a bit disappointed that Walter is coming along, though she doesn't let it show. But, Gary has promised to take Walter to tour the Muppet Studios, and so they all plan to have a great time together. Once there however, they discover the Muppet Studios is a wreck, and the tour is a dud. Walter sneaks away from the group and into Kermit's old office though, and there he overhears a business deal selling the Muppet Studios to greedy oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). He then hears Richman brag to his lackeys that, rather than make a museum out of the place, he really intends to tear it down and drill for oil! A traumatized Walter returns to Gary and Mary with the news, and the three friends seek out Kermit the Frog to save the Muppet Studios from destruction. Unfortunately, Kermit has lost touch with the other Muppets, and so begins a quest to gather them up and put on a telethon (if they can get a celebrity host) to save the Studios and the very Muppet name!<br /><br />The whole film is hilarious and heartwarming, with scenes that will bring tears to nostalgic eyes and even newcomers. This truly is an \\"old school\\" Muppet film (complete with a recreation of the Muppet Show opening and very true to the show yet very modern sketches), and it is successful on all fronts. The cast is perfect, the cameos and return of classic Muppets are delightful, and don't get me started on the songs. They were done by none other than \\"Flight of the Conchords\\" genius Bret McKenzie, and if you're a fan of that show, you'll be able to tell (if you're not familiar, trust me, it's a good thing, a very good thing). One of them even took home the Oscar for Best Song, and deservedl, but especially Walter. Kermit was his hero.

One of them even took home the Oscar for Best Song, and deservedly so. \\"Man or Muppet\\" is simply brilliant, as are the visuals that go with it. It's probably everyone's favorite scene in this film full of great moment after great moment, and tons of wonderful music.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying the film is flawless. It is brilliant, wonderful, a joyous and touching experience, but here is a little list of the only things I could possibly nitpick about off the top of my head. First, the old complaint about the Muppets' new voices still rings true. Kermit sounds better than he has in a while, though I've also gotten more used to him, but now we have to deal with the loss of Frank Oz, who just turned into a tremendous jerk at some point (if what I hear is true) and had to be replaced. Now, we have a Miss Piggy that sounds more manly than ever and a Fozzie who only sometimes sounds like Fozzie. It's tough, but you'll deal with it. This movie is too good not to. Second issue, there is one song in this film the villain performs. It's a rap, and it's not really a necessary song, and it could be funnier. Still, it's okay. The problem? On the Blu-Ray's deleted scenes, we can see the full scene/song rather than the edited version that is in the final film, and ya know what, it is so much better and it actually gives the song purpose. It tells us why he really hates the Muppets, explains his \\"maniacal laugh\\" joke (he actually doesn't know how to laugh, which has to do with why he hates the Muppets but isn't the whole story), and it has funnier lyrics than we get in the shorter version. So, yeah, cutting that song short was a mistake. Thirdly, where was Robin? Or Bean Bunny? And not a single line for Rizzo? Robin is too important to have zero lines, and Rizzo by now is too. I realize they had a lot of Muppets to try and stick in here, and there was a desire to give screen time to those that haven't had any for a while, and that is much appreciated, but I wish Rizzo had at least one joke, much like the one given to Pepe. That was perfect handling of Pepe, whom I enjoy but has gotten way too much spotlight in past several years. Rizzo perhaps was becoming too important too, but he deserved at least a joke. As for Robin and Bean, Robin is classic, and Bean I just don't want to see totally disappear. He takes me back to Jim's last years with us. And finally, the complaint so popular with internet reviewers, the ending of the film resolves a few loose ends rather quickly and in a way that, some might say, cheapens the overall message. I can see how they kinda had to do it that way. I mean, it didn't have to be such a contrived, quicky-quick way of going about it, but they certainly couldn't leave things the way the were. Maybe if the Muppet name hadn't been part of the contract, but that's how it is and, again, it's not something I can't live with. And, those are really the only things I can nit-pick about this still completely fantastic film. But, the real question now is, what will they do for the next big Muppet film? They're already planning it, Segel's co-writer from this one, Nicholas Stoller, is back on board to write and James Bobin, director of this film, will return to direct as well, but no Jason Segel. I've heard entirely that he was the heart and soul of this project and it's truth to the classic Muppets, so here's hoping Stoller and Bobin had a healthy hand in that as well, in reality. I'm really wondering what sort of plot they'll have though. This time it's going to have to be a lot more original, probably.<br /><br />Now, about the \\"Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\" Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and Soundtrack release. First, I'll say that I would have been quite satisfied with just the Blu-Ray and DVD. I don't even need the DVD, but I think it's nice to have in the more basic format if I wanna take it to watch at someone else's house or something. A lot of people don't have Blu-Ray players even today. I couldn't care less about digital copies. I don't have anything to play them on and wouldn't wantto watch a movie on a tiny screen anyway. As for the soundtrack (which is also only a digital version), I already bought it on CD. BUT, with the online coupon from DisneyMovieRewards, the price made it cheaper than buying the non-Wocka Wocka version, so that's cool. Anyway, naturally, great, anamorphic picture, great sound, and the extras here are brilliant (incidentally, I found at least one Easter Egg). The \\"Making Of\\" documentary is done in a clever, British educational film style. Very funny, and as with all the bonus features, the Muppet performers stay in character. Even in the blooper reel, which is also fantastically entertaining. There are plenty of deleted scenes too, full of cut cameos. As I mentioned before, we get the great, full length Tex Richman song as a bonus feature as well. There's also a great screen test that doubles as a comedic short film about screen tests, all those great Muppet movie trailer parodies (save for that most recent \\"Hunger Games\\" one to promote this Blu-Ray), and certainly the most significant bonus feature, the audio commentary with writer and star Segel, co-writer Stroller, and director James Bobin. The audio commentary is one of those really fun commentaries, even if the Muppets don't take part (a Muppet commentary would have been fun too though). Segel's endless, joking Disney plugs are pretty delightful. There's a ton of joking, but we do get insight into the film as well.<br /><br />Oh, and before I forget, this Disney Blu-Ray is equipped with something new, \\"Disney Intermission\\". This new enhancement has its good and bad points. Basically, when you press pause in a film, the screen switches to an intermission mode in which you are entertained by teasers from the bonus features. This is actually a great idea, and you can press pause a second time to pause the intermission mode if you don't want to see it (ENTER takes you back to the film). The issue you might have with it though, is if you are pausing the film to get a better look at something. Luckily, you CAN turn off the \\"Disney Intermission\\", and I assume that would remedy this issue after a bit of a hassle.<br /><br />All in all, this film is a must, and I believe it's something Jim Henson would smile down upon. It's of course particularly good for the Muppet fanatic, but, hey, I know someone who had never seen the Muppets before this and absolutely loved it, so I say everyone should see this! It's really great stuff! But, if I sat here pointing out all the great scenes and cameos, I'd be here all night and you wouldn't get any surprises! The Blu-Ray release is fantastic, so pick it up and see it for yourself!

Anyhow, THIS is different, because it is such well-crafted pop. It's every modern sound in pop music, great melodies and beats, with a strong tenor to sing it. Most of all, it's instantly accessible to kids, to teens, to hipsters, to Gen-X, to boomers. You'd have to have a hard and bitter heart not to like this.<br /><br />Many write about auto-tune here. I too lament its over-use in pop, but it works here as an enhancement, not a coverup for deficient vocal talent.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This baby monitor is pretty much the coolest baby-related gadget we've purchased. It completely met my expectations.  I think it could be improved with the ability to access it from a web browser, but otherwise, good work, Withings!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it should not be free because it is different. you guys are really annoying and letting off a false alarm. get over it cry babies go 5 star!!! I have not even downloaded it. SHUTUP
B007N5YIUS|4.0|they didn't optimize the cutsceens or many of the buttons for screens like the Galaxy Nexus and ironically the Galaxy Note, which is their launch partner. things are really small and tough to see initially. Cool game though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty fun, has a lot of games it gives you a few games at first then you unlock the rest as you get points from the previous games
B007MNV5WU|5.0|but I was so wrong! This may be the best Angry Birds yet! I love it and so does my 5-year-old little one. He thinks this is so cool and so do I. The graphics are wonderful on my Fire. Definitely worth the price! $3 bucks is so little to pay for so much fun!
B00386EZJU|5.0|Great soundtrack. I love the themes and the instruments, my favorite is the Norwegian (Hardanger) fiddle. Music does go from loud to soft to loud a lot so it can be hard to listen to, especially in a car that isn't so quiet, having to turn it down and up and down.....but I don't have many soundtracks that aren't like that.<br />It's a very fun cd and the Sigor Rose song at the end is great too.
B002NBDJAC|5.0|Neil Shubin is a leading paleontologist whose writing style is accessible to anyone. He describes clearly the discovery of the fish that crawled out of the sea onto land, the evolutionary ancestor of the first mammals.  Shubin is also an anatomist, so he can provide clear explanations of the development of all the bones in both fish and mammals.  This is simply a spectacular text, enjoyable from beginning to end.

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This book is so disappointing unless you like to know how to fix tea, how to fix tea again and again.  Nothing but tea making happens for pages.  It has no guts to this story. Bland, tiresome.  I forced myself to finish reading it because of the price.  I will not be reading any more in this series.  I honestly do not know how this made the Best Sellers List.  Were they drinking tea?
0785132619|5.0|I was extremely happy with this comic. I was a big fan of the movie, and heard the comic was even better, and it was no lie. More violent, more language, more sex and more realistic. Not one thing wrong with it, completely new. Can't wait for the second one!

B003PBB4ME|5.0|I see no reason to not use the X-Grip.  It's built strong enough.  It's very light.  I wouldn't want to make it stronger if that also made it heavier.  Even if it were stronger and metal, a camera would be badly damaged in a skateboard accident.  You gotta know your limits and make rational choices.<br /><br />I don't intend to stand on a skateboard while using the X-Grip - I'm 73.  But that's what it's for.  Just the same, it's still useful for me when I take low-angle shots with a small camera.  I like using the X-Grip with my Canon PowerShot SX20IS.  It's good for stills and videos of stationary dogs, kids, and macros.  The size gives stability improvements and inspires creative uses.<br /><br />Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras can also be used, but without the optional battery grip.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|This is not quite a new film, but I was finally able to catch it and now feel obligated to try to express my amazement. This latest big screen version of the Tempest was adapted and directed by Julie Taymor, and may well be the greatest incarnation ever filmed.<br />Helen Mirren as Prospera is positively spellbounding. She is quickly becoming my favorite actress ever (after also catching her insightfully erotic performance as Ayn Rand elsewhere), and I sincerely doubt Shakespeare himself would have found any objection to her interpretation of Prospero. Or really, to this interpretation of his final work in general.<br />Very stylishly shot with special effects that call to mind some of the most imaginative music videos ever produced, Taymor's film is starkly true to the plot and characters of the original play, with adjustments to the dialogue being pleasantly few and inconsequential. Every single freeze frame shot could easily be a conversation-inducing desktop wallpaper, to say the utmost least. Incredibly beautiful in scenery, make-up and costume design, all merge with effects and dynamic camera POVs to create just the right unearthly feel necessary for a totally complete immersion experience. The lyrical words beat a dreamlike rhythm, with the somewhat Gothic and hallucinatory imagery lulling the viewer into a state of introspective grace. This is not art-haus, this is high art.<br />The wondrous cast includes Djimon Hounsou as Caliban in a performance that reminds you why he really is one of the most underrated actors working today. Also good were Chris Cooper, Alan Cumming, and Alfred Molina, with Russell Brand providing energetic comedic relief in the form of Trinculo the jester- by leagues his singular greatest role to date.<br />Why this movie did not receive more attention is a crime of the highest order, the fact of which is singlehandedly compelling me to return to reviewing the occasional film. This is a glorious work, not quite as profound as its source material though far more enjoyable a ride than any previous effort. And I would love if Taymor would set her sights on doing the same for King Lear...maybe starring Donald Sutherland in the title role?<br />Regardless, this is highly recommended. A truly wonderful experience overall.e material though far more enjoyable a ride than any previous effort.

The only complaint is that the controls could use some work, but I am am getting more used to it now.  For me, this is a must have.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I must be the only one in the universe who thought Hunger Games (The Trilogy) was just OK.  I would have given a lower star ranking based on the 2nd and 3rd books which were, in my opinion less than stellar but the first book was interesting enough for me to give the series a 3 star ranking overall.<br /><br />The first book, The Hunger Games was a little slow starting but once I got through the shocking violence (truly, this can't be for tweens, let alone teens to read...the violence is definitely PG (pretty gross)), I actually thought the story was pretty interesting.  Katniss, the reluctant heroine was predictable through all three books.  I enjoyed her adventurous spirit in the first book but I did not like the depressed, suicidal girl she became in the third book.<br /><br />I think it is for that reason that I found the last book in the series, Mockingjay to be one of the most bleak novels I had ever read.  There was no sense of hope, not really a happy ending either.<br /><br />On the eve before the movie \\"Hunger Games\\" hits the theatres I wonder if I will think for the first time that the movie will be better than the book.  I guess I'll find out.
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|This movie is super cute.  I don't have kids but continue to enjoy these movies, the adult humor gets me everytime!
1594744769|3.0|I found this book under the Christmas tree at my sister-in-law's home. It was a gift for two 11-year old twins. I picked it up and was intrigued by the story and writing style of the first chapter enough to order it. It seemed to be a story about a grandfather describing the holocaust in a way his young grandson could understand: once into it a bit further, I was concerned about some content. I can definitely say I don't want 11 year olds talking about mothers blowing homeless men for food stamps. That is the some of the repartee you'll find between the protagonist and his best friend; I don't believe that impressionable minds should be let loose without supervision with this sort of material, and surely this snippet will find its way to school. If you think your children are mature enough to handle it- great, and good luck to you. It seems to be pandering to every unhappy teen's fantasy of a \\"wow-what if I had no parents!\\" world. The loner boy goes off in search of closure over the mystery of his grandfather's death- meets a girl- leaves mom at home, dumps his dad and maybe saves the world- we don't know because there's an obvious sequel in the works. I'm not on tenterhooks waiting for it.

B006KSAPV0|5.0|Pedro Almod&oacute;var  has created so many superb surrealistic yet intensely human films that it s no surprise that he should enter the genre of horror stories.  THE SKIN I LIVE IN (La piel que habito) takes us deep inside a terrifying concept and yet for all the potential for being a gore fest he manages to make it one of his finest explorations of the human psyche.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) lives in a mansion with his servant: Marilla (Marisa Paredes) is the head of the household and happens to be Robert's mother as well - Roberto having been raised by the family for whom Marilla was working at the time the head of the household impregnated her. Robert is a plastic surgeon and has committed his teaching and research and creativity towards perfecting a type of skin that sustain fire, cuts, and insects, and despite the lack of backing of his prestigious colleagues to extend this work toward work with humans, Robert is working in secret in his home trying to devise a skin that would have helped his late wife severely burned in an auto accident. His patient in progress is Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya) on whom Robert works day and night to perfect his `invention' of perfect skin. In a typical Almod&oacute;var move, a strange man in a tiger costume (for Carnival) arrives at Robert's home: Zeca (Roberto &Aacute;lamo) is a criminal on the run, needs money, happens to be the other son of Marilla, and is the one responsible for the fiery accident that disfigured Robert's wife who subsequently committed suicide when after surviving the accident sees her own distorted image in a window and leaps to her death.<br /><br />The film takes us back six years to explain the events: Robert's daughter Norma (Blanca Su&aacute;rez) has been hospitalized and medicated for mental illness since she observed her mother's suicide.  But she goes to a party where she is desired by a young lad Vicente (Jan Cornet) and in the throes of drugs the two enter into an attempted sexual liaison that is discovered by Roberto.  What happens after this is best left unsaid as the key to the terror of the film has begun and sharing more would deprive the viewer of the suspense and brilliance of the script.<br /><br />The story was adapted by Pedro Almod&oacute;var and Agust&iacute;n Almod&oacute;var from a French novel `Tarantula' by Thierry Jonquet, the phenomenal musical score was written by Alberto Iglesias, and the haunting cinematography is the work of Jos&eacute; Luis Alcaine. Blessed with a cast of magnificent actors (Almod&oacute;var's usual entourage plus more) Pedro Almod&oacute;var directs this fascinating film to new heights, even for him.  The story is complex and while it is bizarre in almost every aspect, it remains a film that explores the human psyche, the power of love, revenge, and the extremes seemingly ordinary people will go if motivated. It is a brilliant film that only grow better with repeated viewings.  Grady Harp, March 12al liaison that is discovered by Roberto.

0545265355|5.0|As an adult who works with teens, I like to be up on what they are reading. A friends daughter told me about the Hunger Games books when we saw the movie preview when we went to see Breaking Dawn. She lent me the books and I could not put them down. I finished the series in a weekend. I am not going to say whether it is appropriate or not since that is an individual decision, but I loved these books.I purchased my own set and much like other books, I know I will be rereading these books many times.<br /><br />Reading is for enjoyment and whether its Harry Potter, Twilight, or the Hunger Games... As long as kids are READING, how can that be criticized?
B000PMG16U|4.0|I was lucky enough to get the original series on DVD when it included the uncut version as seen in theaters. There was no desire at all to get these in Blu Ray with all the changes being made to them, but for the Prequels I really didn't see a reason not to get these. I am sure there are some changes here as well (have not read other reviews); I know some changes were made to Yoda in episode I, but it has honestly been so long since I have seen any of these I really didn't notice. And to be honest these 3 aren't as near and dear to me as the originals.<br /><br />Episode I still makes me cringe with Jar Jar and the actor playing Anikan. I would say this is for sure my least favorite of the entire series. But once past Episode II and III are quite entertaining and look great in Blu. Over all I am really happy with this purchase and it is nice to have the complete set. Now if they would just release the original trilogy in Blu without all the changes...then I would truly be happy!

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game. Never have I played a game that provided so much challenge to it such as this. This physics-based game will keep you entertained from start to finish with its many challenging levels. It literally gets difficult after at least the first 10 stages of the game as far as my opinion, but this addiction is what challenges you to keep going and racking up high scores in each stage. Careful thought and aiming precision are key to marking you victorious.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best 3 books I've read in a long time. From beginning to end, I found myself lost in these characters lives. The amount of times I choked up, felt so extremely sad, laughed and cheered was incredible. I seriously can't wait until my children are older to read them. A definite MUST READ.
B000063COX|5.0|I don't like Bruce Dickinson's voice.  I think it's the constant vibrato.  Yeah, I said it.  I know lots of people do, but I myself much prefer this album right here - first one I ever heard, and is on a top several albums of all time list for sure.  Strong punk rock influence on this record; with tight counter point melodies over basic chord progressions this album pulls off both epic-ness and simplicity in spades without forgetting about the subtleties that make music a joy to listen to.  Great recording and mixing I think. One of a kind...
B0054JZC6E|1.0|what a retarded game. why the hell does it take 21 hours to make lattes? basically you tap the screen a few times and wait a day. not interested in a game that has five seconds of play per day..

1847940323|5.0|This was a great book. By using the analogy of an Elephant, its rider and the path the Heath brothers show that change can be easy whether it be in business, at work, or even in your personal life.<br /><br />I've got habits that need to change and the concepts provided have given me hope that change doesn't have to be a massive overhaul all at once. Trying to make too big of a change will \\"spook the elephant.\\" And at that point, no matter how bad you want to change, the \\"elephant\\" isn't moving.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter they give a little section that you get to apply the concepts in each chapter. It really is a terrific book.<br /><br />I'm sharing this book with friends, family, clients, and...i'll probably read it again!
1407130293|5.0|The book series is fantastic! The books came in great condition, as well!<br />One thing, is that Suzzane Collins didn't really connect me to the characters. The story is amazing, but the writing I thought was just okay. Don't get me wrong, I couldn't put them down, and read them in 4 days, but I did not cry once, whereas in Harry Potter, Jo did such an amazing job and really making me believe the characters were real that I cry in every book.<br />Regardless, amazing series, great stories, I recommend them!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I started reading the fanfic, loved it of course, but wasn't able to finish it. I was timid to read these books since the names changed but I'm so glad that I did. It is an amazing book series. A well-written, emotional story that you won't be able to stop reading. I just told my friend that you will smile, laugh, cringe, awww, tear-up and get all hot and bothered reading these books. I wish the audiobook would come out soon so I can listen to the whole story again and again.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|same experience...just as I was getting into the game, I reached 28 elements and started getting a \\"force close.\\" I couldn't do a thing after that.  Too bad, because it was a relatively amusing game...update--I uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and other than having to start over, everything has gone swimmingly with no more issues.  I changed my rating to reflect this.<br />Really, the game is worth getting just fir the seemingly inexhaustable quotes that come with your creations!
B000Q66JXA|3.0|I love the movie, it would be 5 stars, BUT...the quality of the blu-ray disc: It is grainy all the time and it crops the top and bottom of the movie!!! WHY???

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I normally read books very quickly, absorbing the information very easily. I have read 700 page books in a single day, 200 page books in a few hours. Not with this book. I purchased this book in November of 2011, and after reading almost every single night, finally finished yesterday. Never in my life have I read a book with so much imagination, imagery, and twists and turns. After dedicating 5 months of my reading life to the densest book I have ever read, I am happy to say that this book may be the greatest book I have ever read. George R.R. Martin does a fantastic job of leaving you with such cliffhangers at the end of chapters that you want to keep reading just to get to the next instance of that character. Be warned, you will be emotionally drained after reading this book. I think I will wait a little while before picking up the fourth book, but when I do, I'm excited to see what Mr. Martin has planned for me.

1450400957|5.0|I find myself agreeing with the author(s) that working out at home is better than going to the gym and I find their comments on the various excellent exercises they present to be genuinely helpful. I found, for example, a discussion of impingement syndrome (which I have suffered from for over two years) genuinely illuminating. It connects shoulder impingement with over-training of the front and lateral deltoids and under training of the rear deltoids and the infraspinatus (muscle over shoulder blade) - and it connects this syndrome with nerve compression. I have not seen such a good discussion - and after only a very short time of acting on this analysis my shoulders feel better than they have even after weeks and weeks of physical therapy. Big book, well set out, great breakdown of all the good exercises and helpful list of programmes to help you use the exercises for various purposes. This is one of the most intelligent discussions of exercise principles and one of the best selection of exercises and exercise programmes that I have discovered to date.

0385333846|5.0|I love Vonnegut and this is my favorite Vonnegut book. I'm sure there's nothing I can say about his work that hasn't already been said but I'll try anyway. Like previous Vonnegut books, the plot involves a pseudo sci-fi premise but the novel is really about Vonnegut's observations regarding human behavior in the face of a chaotic universe over which we have no control. His protagonist encounters cruelty and hatred everywhere he goes, but also kindness and the chance for a little dignity in the most unexpected places. Nobody can describe the absurdity (and sheer horror) of the human condition with a liberal dose of black humor and manage to sneak in the slightest hint of optimism like Kurt Vonnegut.<br /><br />James Pratt, author of 'When Dead Gods Dream: A Collection of Lovecraftian Short Stories'

There definitely were funny, smart and interesting parts, but it just didn't sustain great momentum. To paraphrase another reviewer about the author's tone: often, Fey makes it seem like she doesn't really want to be sharing these stories with you, and its disconcerting as a reader.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|I love this album. Interestingly enough when I first bought it and ran through it I was not impressed. I came to Amazon to leave a mediocre review only to see that it already had eight reviews, every single one of them five stars. I was not about to be the person who spoiled such a rarity so I decided to play it a few more times. Those few more times have turned into what feels like fifty.<br /><br />Lets just forget about the final \\"song\\", the orchestra thing. Apart from that, this album is beyond solid. I love to blast it driving around town, it pumps me up and encourages reckless driving on the back-roads. Nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />My favorite song would have to be The Devil's Den. Skrillex's smoothie blend of dubstep and house is mesmerizing and loud. I find that this album promotes general feelings of awesomeness with hints of boss scattered around here and there. Buy it. Love it. Buy another copy and give it to your best friend. That is all

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I Love LOVE LOVE playing Angry Birds on my I-Pod touch and I Was EXTRA excited to have it on my Kindle Fire!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this action-packed fantasy-adeventure (and I generally don't care much for fantasy-adventures) because of the great hook dropped in the first chapter and the continued suspense throughout.  The pop-culture references brought back great memories of my childhood, some stuff I hadn't thought about for decades (e.g. the Atari video game \\"Adventure\\" -- classic!).  I think any child of the 80's (or 70's or 90's, for that matter) should pick up this book.  You likely won't put it down until Halliday's Hidden Egg is found.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great application for passing the time away. There are a lot of games so you will not get bored quickly at all!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|great game never frezed this game is hours of fun couldn't stop playing till i beat the game and the mini games!
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|My wife and I enjoy this kind of story, but we found \\"Game of Thrones\\" to be dull and vulgar.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|OMG!!! amazing. thanks so much. i love it <3 this has been an amazing book and it has been great reading it on my kindle.
B0072X2O66|4.0|Great jams and talent. Would love to see these guys live. The only thing that I would have liked better is that John Moyer would have been able to do some of the recording. Great vocals and guitar work. I am not a drummer, but know who Mike Portnoy is and have seen Dream Theatre back in the day. The drummer in my band loves Mike Portnoy in DT. I let him borrow this cd and told him not to expect anything like DT. He loves it. I have seen all the negative reviews about it not being progressive enough. Thank god it is not. It rocks your face off. I hope these guys keep this project rolling and carry on further with John Moyer on board.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I really like it. wish it had a way to mark what combos have been done already or even as another reviewer said a way to turn  off the feature that allows repeats so you don't keep making the same combos.
B004T4KQJS|3.0|[[ASIN:145162445X A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing]] This work is advertised as being easy to understand, but perhaps no work about time and space can provide an easy explantion. I think the author has done as good a job with such a complex subject as is possible, and in places he made some things clear to me. On the other hand, my interest began to wane the further along I went, and eventually I gave up. Perhaps this review speaks to my limitations rather than to the work itself. I am no mathematian and the diagrams for a \\"flat\\" universe versus a \\"spherical\\" universe meant to enlighten the reader left me more baffled than ever. I'd say this work is well worth the price if you have a certain turn of mind. In my case, my mind simply turned off. Halcion.
B000001FN3|5.0|This is a really really great album filled with really really great songs and really really great lyrics and stuff like that.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Thus album is usually picked on, since many said it was weaker than their previous material. I disagree. I think this album os on par with With the Beatles or Please Please Me. All the covers on the album are amazing, such as 'Honey Don't', one of Ringo's best vocals, and they have the best cover of 'Rock and Roll Music' of all time. George also nails 'Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby.' The originals are even better. John Lennon started to get influence from Bob Dylan, and it is really evident on songs like 'No Reply,' and 'I'm A Loser,' complete with a harmonica solo. Paul's song 'I'll Follow The Sun' is an instant classic, and 'What You're Doing' is just plain great. Songs like 'Eight Days A Week' 'Every Little Thing' and 'Baby's In Black' are really good. This album was the Beatles dip into folk rock, which would also be explored on \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul.\\" This album is fantastic and was a good end for 1964. All in all, I give this album a 9/10.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was selected by our book club and I did not know what to expect. The book caught my attention from the first page and kept it until the last.  One of the best books I have read in a while.  Very entertaining and thought provoking.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|I Liked It.  Not your classic sawzem up woods killerThriller.  It had a plot, a dog and a semiBelieveable ending so thats more than most.  I enjoyed the simplicity but not too far reaching tale.  This could transpire as filmed.  No big name actors or esses, just a logBudget film that I hope does well.  Go D&T!
1400052181|5.0|[[ASIN:1400052181 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]<br />  \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" tells a story that is both chilling and saddening. I read it as assigned reading for a Microbiology class this semester, but really I would have read it for pleasure as well, for the story is one that grips you and draws you into the lives of its subjects. I had never heard of HeLa let alone the woman behind the cells, but now I am glad I discovered both by means of this book. I would hate to view these cells purely through the clinical lenses of a science textbook or lecture.<br /> This book is a perfect blend of science and life. It broaches touchy subjects like racism and the inability of the impoverished to get health care, but in a tactful manner. On one hand it ignites your righteous indignation, but on the other your sympathy. From the eyes of science, Dr. Gey was a God send, but to Henrietta's family he was a curse. Before this book was written no one had bothered to see the story from Henrietta's or her family's point of view. It took a motivated author to stick to this noteworthy story despite the numerous obstacles she faced.<br /> I highly recommend this book, if you are looking for a story that both educates and stirs the heart.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Excellent game with great graphics and fun to play.  The story line is moderately interesting but the different game layouts is nice.  Overall, it is the best Mahjong game I have played.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|It's all too rare that a show puts in the effort to make its own mark rather than pandering to an audience.  In making the focus of Teen Wolf the effect of lycanthropy on lacrosse performance, this show instantly sets itself apart from other supernatural dramas and boldly asks: why should being a werewolf play a bigger role in the formation of identity than making first line on the lacrosse team?<br /><br />As we learn in the show, lacrosse is anger.  And the physical manifestations of anger (increased heart rate, increased testosterone, and so on) are directly linked to changing form, or \\"wolfing out\\".  How will Scott keep the two sides of his life in balance, especially when his wolf-claws keep ruining his gloves?  At the full moon, for example, Scott's inner wolf is much harder to control, and hormones abound: careful Scott!  Think about how making out with the captain's girlfriend will affect the team dynamics!  Add in a werewolf-hunter girlfriend to the mix and you'll be on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But Teen Wolf doesn't pretend that heightened werewolf senses are the only thing that affects lacrosse performance.  Jackson's prowess on the field, for example, seems to be due to the need to impress absent parents, an effect of being adopted.  As we hear almost continuously throughout the show, Danny (the goalie) is gay.  Does that affect his lacrosse performance?  No.  No it doesn't.
B0030B624E|5.0|Great movie, very funny. Incredible actors. My whole family enjoyed the entire movie. The cast together was awesome, it probably would not have been as good with a different mix of cast.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!  It is naughty :), funny and an easy read.  The characters are well written and the story doesn't get stale.  I read through this book in four days and then the second and then the third!  Love them!  So glad to have found them.

1607053888|3.0|I purchased this book for my daughter's 15th birthday.  However, my older (17 and an experienced sewist) daughter is the one who started sewing from it.  We were disappointed at the pattern piece configuration, as not all the pieces were on the same page.  The pattern was read through several times before fabric was cut.  Little things in the pictures were annoying like the way the pins were placed with points facing out of the fabric, and telling the sewer to fan outward the tabs on the magnetic closures when the pictures show them pressed inward...  My daughters bags have all turned out wonderfully.  The patterns are nice in this book and we will continue to make bags from it.  A beginner would probably not do so well with this book.

B0010SKUYM|3.0|Taken by itself, this first novel is a major achievement. You'll find plenty of solid background and anticipation build-up. Kvothe could have grown into an anti-hero on par with Moorcock's Elric. Unfortunately, this story doesn't stand on its own.<br /><br />Look folks, BIG SPOILER here:<br /><br />Everything Rothfuss builds in Name of the Wind is irredeemably wrecked in the following book Wise Man's Fear. If you make the mistake of falling in love with Name of the Wind, Rothfuss will break your heart with the sequel.
B005I4JG80|4.0|An easy and interesting read, I really enjoyed this well-written and informative book. Not normally a topic that would interest me, I was drawn to it by it's original English title - something along the lines of \\"Why French babies don't throw their food\\" - and the fact that it is written by an American woman who is not exactly a Francophile. As I have done and still do a fair amount of extended international travel and I'm always amazed how much better-behaved and calmer overseas children (and their parents) appear to be than our domestically-grown variety, this small book shone a lot of light on an important subject....
0756404738|1.0|The Name of the Wind blew (sorry) us all away with its combination of skilled writing, engaging characters, and ironic wisdom. Along with many of you, I thought I would spend many years exploring new worlds and seeking out new civilizations with what I believed was a very talented new writer.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear has none of the positives of its predecessor.  None.<br /><br />Kvothe bores. The constant sex bores. I didn't know I'd signed up for endless amateurish porn writing. Nearly all of the other characters annoy. The randomly inserted feminist agenda annoys--not because I care one way or the other--but because it's so jarringly out of place. The plot meanders slowly in a full circle.<br /><br />Worst of all, this novel made me stop caring about characters that the previous one had made me care about very much.<br /><br />I won't bother seeking out book three.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found this conclusion to the whole Fifty Shades Trilogy satisfying because it brings to the surface in a moving way what I think James explores throughout her story.  No, these three books are not about how the love of a good woman can save a rascal--FSoF continues to show that Anastasia can't save Christian by her love.  And no, they're not about how trust and patience can teach lovers to accept each other's sexual pleasures even when these take them 'way outside the usual comfort zones--Anastasia remains frightened, almost to the end, of what Christian might do to her sexually when he's angry.<br /><br />Instead, these books are about fifty shades of child abuse, both what Christian suffers as a toddler and what is inflicted on him by a sexual predator.  He has to acknowledge truths about his birth mother and about \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" that allow him to see correctly both how much he really loved the one and really should abhor the other.  Anastasia has been saying this from fairly early on in Fifty Shades of Grey, but by herself she can't get Christian there.<br /><br /> *** SPOILER ALERT ***<br /><br />Instead, he is finally saved by the coming of his own child who, he learns to realize, will one day need his protection from both neglect (\\"sh***y parenting,\\" as he calls it) and from sexual abuse. Finally he's able to see both his birth mother and Elena with new, more adult eyes. And James' handling of the unexpected pregnancy is really well done--painful and true to form for both Anastasia and Christian, with no sudden hearts and flowers.<br /><br />Incidentally, if my focus seems too much on Christian when the point of view is Anastasia's, I'd point out that her name means \\"Resurrection\\" in Greek (& Russian)--that we're talking about salvation at some fundamental level seems obviously flagged by these two names!<br /><br />So why not five stars?  Like the first two books, this one is too long; two awkward and unnecessary plot lines continue to plod along.  One iscompletely useless, involving a former 'sub,' and the other, involving Mr. Hyde (another obvious name!), is mainly useful for generating Anastasia's Christ-like sacrifice and death-like coma during which Christian finally is 'saved.'  (Sorry, but there really is a lot of religious symbolism for what is being marketed as a BDSM romance!)
1451627289|5.0|I was truly surprised by King's new novel. And I didn't have high hopes for it.<br /><br />After finishing (and greatly disliking) Under the Dome, I debated whether I was done with King. After reading the disappointing Mile 81, I was sure I was done with King. But decided to give him one more change.<br /><br />Boy am I ever glad I did!<br /><br />Jake Epping, an English teacher from 2011, is given the chance to go back in time. His friend Al Templeton has a supply closet in his diner that also happens to be a rabbit hole to September of 1958. Al is dying and leaves Jake with an important task: go back in time and stop the assassination of JFK.<br /><br />This is easy feat. Because the past is obdurate; it moves against Jake and doesn't want to be changed. But there are also other distractions.<br /><br />One is: Did Oswald do the deed alone? Jake must determine this before he acts. The second? A woman named Sadie who Jake falls in love with. Will he risk everything, even the love of his past life, to save another?<br /><br />At 850 pages, my meagre summary of the plot doesn't come close to covering everything that happens in 11/22/63. But that's okay. No plot summary would come close because there is so much life in this novel. The parts where Jake is living through the fifties and sixties really come to life in King's writing and the stories contained within are ones that are at once timeless and essential.<br /><br />It's a novel that you want to live in. Rarely have I been so affected by a novel. It really wasn't about the assassination, but about the characters and that is where King really shines. He made an 850 page novel seem like it was 300 pages; that is how good the writing is.<br /><br />There are no supernatural elements to the novel, but that isn't a downside. King has tried something different by writing what could be loosely described as historical romantic fiction. The good thing is that he succeeds on every level.<br /><br />I loved this book so much that I didn't want it to end. When I did finish it, I was left breathless, teary eyed and wanting more. That is the mark of a great book and this is Stephen King's best work to date, hands down.ch that I didn't want it to end. When I did finish it, I was left breathless, teary eyed and wanting more.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|This card works well on the Macbook Pro 17 (Feb 2011).  Reads cards like it should.  Only thing is that you need to download the driver from Transcend's website and install it for this to work.  I did expect plug-n-play.  Not sure if it is possible with a card that can read SDXC.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I can't believe how many people are complaining that it is NOT free! Pathetic! I am more than happy to pay a measly $2.99 for a game that not only am I going to enjoy but my wife and daughter who both LOVE Angry Birds will enjoy countless hours playing. With the new nuances this version has it is a stellar (pardon the pun) addition to the Angry Birds family. Why complain about $2.99 price tag? I know Obama's economic policies have failed completely and people are tighter on their budgets but, you don't need to take out a freakin' loan to purchase! Fore go your double espresso mocha latte from Starbucks for one d**n day!

B005L38QK2|4.0|I don't do a huge amount of gaming on my computer. But when I do, I use this mouse to enhance my play. It has a great soft feel plastic to it. The scroll wheel doesn't flow freely, but is notched. What's nice are the customizable buttons that are available. However, being an ambidextrous mouse, you may find yourself hitting buttons that you don't intend to, until you get the feel of it. It has a nice middle button that lets you switch between two different DPI settings. You can't scale the DPI settings on the fly, but you can switch back and forth between your presets. The braided cord feels very sturdy. I found this mouse to be rather light. It glided across a clean mousepad with no issues. However, there is no option to add any weight to the mouse, as there is with some other gaming mice. I think this is an oversight. I could care less about the Diablo design, but it does look pretty cool when it's glowing red! The software that lets you customize the buttons with actions/macros is fairly simple to use. It allows you to save various profiles. Just what you'd expect. All in all, it's a good gaming mouse and should be considered when shopping for one.

B001UV4XWY|3.0|\\"It's just a box.\\" So you get a box and are offered a million dollars to push the button. But someone will die. Is that really any different than someone handing you a gun and offering you a million dollars for a hit? Why are they even sitting around saying, \\"should we push it?\\". With a gun there would be no question. But take away the name and face of the victim, and all of a sudden, \\"it's just a box.\\" That was the one thing that really baffled me. Did they really think there would be no consequences to their actions?<br /><br />No, I take it back. That was not the only thing that baffled me. The entire second half of the movie baffled me. I will still give it 3 stars because it held my attention throughout, but once they introduced the extraterrestrial element, they lost me. I've watched the movie twice now and I just do not understand it. I was feeling pretty stupid until I read some other reviews and found that it didn't make sense to most people who saw it...even the people who loved it!
B00122M2QU|5.0|A friend of mine handed me a copy of this CD about a week ago, and it has not left my CD player since. Inflikted hit me like a sledge hammer and was soooo much better than the anything I have heard from Max since Arise. This is the best metal album that I have heard in years, and I listen to ALOT of metal. My personal favorites are the title track, Black Ark, Ultra Violent, and Nevertrust. WARNING: while listening to this album, you may be compelled to turn the volume up to neighbor disturbing decible levels.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I remember this was the first movie I bought with my own money (on VHS!) when I was 9 years old. Of course these days I have this special edition DVD and I like it just as much now. I always loved Ariel. I think she's probably my favorite Disney heroine. I never could understand why she wanted to become human, even as I got older... after all, she barely knew Eric! Being a swimmer who adores the water, I sympathized much more with her daughter in the sequel! Well, it's a fairy tale, so I guess she has to get her prince. And of course, I was jealous of her gorgeous hair. I had that hair color for a couple months when I was 20 and in college. What an influence from a Disney movie!<br /><br />I think the music in this movie is superior to some other Disney movies. The animation is beautiful. (Of course, I may be prejudiced because I love the water.) And I enjoyed both sequels. They tend to be better when Disney makes them quickly instead of 40 years later.
B004EPZ034|5.0|I think some parents are looking into this waaayyy too much! It is a cartoon and although it is obviously for those with an imagination, it is not meant to be a learning experience. My husband and I took my daughter to see this when it came out. I found it very cute, it kept even our attention and my daughter loved it. My daughter loves to dance around the house and sing songs she magically comes up with, and this cartoon had plenty of that! I think the rating was fine. So what if the chipettes put on salsa dresses and competed with human dancers? I didn't think it was provocative and honestly my daughter has more than likely seen worse dressed people out in public. You can't take your kids around blind folded. My daughter didn't go home looking for a short dress or walk around \\"shaking her booty.\\" Come on people. I take my daughter to church every Sunday and live by the book so we are probably a little more strict than some parents, but these reviews are insane!! There were no curse words, no adult content, and no nudity. I see no problem here! There is not even anything remotely teaching bad habits here (except for maybe Alvin's behavior). Even in the Shrek movies Shrek burps and doesn't say excuse me, but no one commented on that! I tought my daughter manners before I taught her anything else so this bothered me (although very little). I still let her watch every one of those that came out! So in my opinion, this was an excellent movie and I will be buying the DVD for my daughter the day it comes out.
0385504225|3.0|In the Robert Langdon trilogy, The Da Vinci Code is definitely my favorite. As someone who unfortunately grew up Catholic and is now agnostic, religious conspiracy theories never fail to amuse me. Especially when churches try to ban the movie! Speak out against it, personally boycott it, fine. But banning it? That's just funny. So obviously I also loved Angels and Demons. While I enjoyed The Lost Symbol, I just didn't think it was up to the level of the first two. I still think it will make an excellent movie, however! And we need to finish our trilogy.<br /><br />Here were my problems:<br />1. Why did Robert have such a hard time believing everything unbelievable? He spent the entire first two books convincing other people of unbelievable things. Suddenly he's a total skeptic.<br />2. Why didn't anyone point out to the villain that if only the worthy could be enlightened, having someone else solve all the puzzles for him obviously meant he wasn't worthy? Just because he was going to tattoo the final answer on his head, what did it really mean if he didn't come up with the answer himself? (By the way, it's very difficult to cover tattoos with makeup. I find it hard to believe that he hid them on his entire body.)<br />3. I HATED that the Noetics research was saved. People died (lots of them), but the beloved research was saved. Were they really delusional enough to think this kind of \\"technology\\" and \\"advancement\\" was a good thing??? People are already capable of hurting each other from a distance these days due to wonderful advancements such as facebook and text messaging. I can only imagine what damage could be done once the world / the government / regular people have the power to do whatever they want with their minds. And we won't even have any evidence they were there.<br /><br />Besides that, the similarities to the first two books were what I enjoyed. The way all the elements came together...  the way all the puzzles suddenly made sense. I wish I could fit as much information into my brain as Robert Langdon does! Speaking of which, I'd hate to read a book like this for class instead of for pleasure. Boy would that make a nightmare test.s much information into my brain as Robert Langdon does!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down.  In fact, I read the entire triology in two days.  The story graps you from the beginning and never lets go.  The theme behind the story portrays the underlying message without lecturing.  It is a subtle \\"wake up\\" and realize the damage we are doing to our world.  It gives you a picture of how we have become so desensitized to horror and evil that it becomes an terrifying game that people grave to watch.  What is particulary enjoyable about the book is how the author evolves the characters.  You will learn what drives them to do the things they do and understand their pain.
0545265355|5.0|The best way to read these books is all together, one after the other. Suzanne Collins has a complete story in each book, however, each is left as a cliff hanger, leaving you eager to see what happens next. I strongly recommend purchasing the boxed trilogy.<br /><br />Though labeled as \\"young adult\\" literature, I am 62 and completed Suzanne Collin's \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, in one long weekend. Young adults are the main characters, however, the plot and story line are anything but juvenile. I have always been partial to science fiction because you can create an environment/setting outside the norm.<br /><br />Picture the future where the United States is divided into districts and the citizens are strictly limited to their area and producing whatever their district is best at...coal, electronics, food, etc. ALL for the ruling district..The Capital. There are many details that are frightening and believable at the same time.<br /><br />The story is a fascinating imagination of horrors, struggles, triumphs and humanity at it's best and worst. I could not put down the books until I finished the third one.<br /><br />It is a worthwhile read.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is definitely the best Angry Birds since the first one came out.  The last 2 releases were really just clones of the original and didn't feature much new content at all.<br /><br />Angry Birds Space changes the way the game is played.  They now give you a line to see the route the bird will take, but the game definitely isn't easier as they've complicated matters with things like gravitational field entry and exit (including orbit).<br /><br />The visuals, the music and the gameplay are all big plusses here that bring something fresh to the Angry Birds title.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|This movie was a complete disappointment. I was one of the biggest fans of the original Indiana Joneses. I remember as a kid I would watch the Indiana Jones films over and over again. They were simply a classic to me.<br /><br /> I wonder what happened?  I don't know but I just don't get it.  Reading the reviews around here so many seem to have the same opinion on how this one went completely astray from the originals.  Funny how it is, I was thinking to myself finally Hollywood will make a film again worth watching. Not!!

They now give you a line to see the route the bird will take, but the game definitely isn't easier as they've complicated matters with things like gravitational field entry and exit (including orbit).<br /><br />The visuals, the music and the gameplay are all big plusses here that bring something fresh to the Angry Birds title.<br /><br />The only \\"con\\" I have for this is REQUIREMENT to get a more expensive version for the kindle fire - but that seems to be a growing trend these days...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love angry birds and I love this game! It really is just one of the best angry bird apps!
0771035799|4.0|Ben Goldacre's Bad Science was a pleasure to read. He very thoroughly covered clinical trial design and statistics in a way that was not mind-numbingly dull. With this background he explored some of the less scientific areas of health care such as homeopathy. If you are expecting a neutral discussion of topics such as these, then you will be disappointed as Goldacre sticks to the facts, which do support mainstream medicine. If you are on the side of real medicine however, I strongly recommend this book to you. The only shortcomings are that a lot of references are to situations in the U.K. and that Goldacre only talks about medicine, contrary to the name of the book. If you are more interested in general science, then I recommend Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan.

When I hit the SYNC button on my DEVICE it claims that it did sync but when I go to Google Tasks in my Google Calendar there is NOTHING!! Does anyone else have this problem?  I wonder why they'd claim it works if it doesn't?  What a big disappointment because the app ROCKS!!  If it's a bug I hope they fix it soon....ALSO, when I hit the SYNC button withing the App it says that it sync'd but WHERE TO is the next question!!!!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Well, this series started off good, and is getting even better. Frankly, many of the British shows that \\"cross the pond\\" are not that impressive to me. This broke the pattern magnificently. Realistic characters that you can identify with, and a plot line that represents the domestic concerns of the British during the period rather well. We are always seeing movies or series during a war from the soldiers' perspective. This is an excellent portrayal of what happens at home, and of the shifting social climate in the UK then. Some aspects of the culture were preserved, some were not, and this series does an excellent job of representing some of the contributing factors to a changing national identity. Obviously, I wasn't alive during the period in question, (as I figure there are few alive still with a memory of the period,) so I can't speak from first-hand experience, but it is in keeping with the first-hand accounts I've read from then. Most of the actors are very good at their trade, and the few I've seen that weren't were only very small roles, anyway. Very impressive. If you enjoy history, I strongly recommend this series.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I thought this book was going to be filled with horror and danger. It wasn't. This book is more like fantasy with odd photos. I didn't really enjoy it. It wasn't dynamic, and that's what I love in stories. Although I didn't enjoy this book, it wasn't a terrible read.
B001NFY1VA|4.0|As is often the case when I go back and look at movies that I hadn't seen in a while, I find little nuggets that were missed and annoyances that I overlooked.  Such is the case with this multi-Oscar nominee.  Directed and written by Anthony Minghella (\\"Michael Clayton\\"), this film is another version of his \\"The English Patient.\\"  I would suggest that if you liked that movie, you'll like this one.  If not, I doubt you will like this either.<br /><br />Jude Law is very good (Oscar nom.) as Inman, a simple carpenter in a small North Carolina community who meets Ada (Nicole Kidman), a newly transplanted preacher's daughter.  The sparks fly but the mores of the era suggest slow going and before you know it, Inman is off to war to fight the Yankees before any chance for courting take root.  Minghella doesn't shy away from the violence as Inman's Confederates engage in ferocious battles with the Union army.  Wounded and hospitalized, he decides that his longing for Ada is too much and heads back home at the risk of being caught for desertion.<br /><br />The film flashes back and forth in dream and real time sequences with Ada's developing plight when her father dies and she is unable to cope with hard work.  This is where Renee Zellweger enters the story in her Oscar winning performance as Ruby, a hard working woman \\"as good as any man.\\"  The town now devoid of young men is being overtaken by thugs headed by local land baron Teague (Ray Winstone) who has eyes on Ada and her land.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the most interesting part of the film is the journey of Inman as he walks back home.  Starving and cold he comes upon a cast of characters that add spice to what could be a tired middle section of the movie.  The best of these is with Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a local reverend who has impregnated a young black slave.  Better still, and for my money the real \\"best actress,\\" is with Inman and Sara played with a remarkable combination of poise and sorrow by Natalie Portman.  Living in a one room cabin in the wilderness, she has a newborn and has lost her husband to the war.  Inman shows up on a rainy night, in need of shelter and food.  Reluctantly, Sara allows him in and lets him stay in a corn crib that is attached to the cabin.  Inman, in love with Ada who remains the driving force behind his journey isn't out for any hanky panky.  Besides he's too tired.  Sara isn't looking for sex but is clearly lonely and in great despair so asks him to share her bed, \\"but that's it,\\" she says.  They do and it is, but she breaks into tears longing for companionship.  A truly heartbreaking scene.<br /><br />Ultimately Inman finds his way home and back to Ada, but the movie continues with the outcome still uncertain.

B004EPYZXK|5.0|This is a good re enactment of what happened . It doesn't come much better than this. Great to have it follow in history's footsteps.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|Once you get past the fact that this is not the Sherlock Holmes you remembered as a kid, this is a pretty good action comedy. Kind of a Victorian \\"Lethal Weapon.\\" I'm not sure, but I doubt that the form of martial arts used by Holmes, Watson and most of the villains had infiltrated Europe or had even been formulated in the 1890's. I could be wrong. In any case Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their bromance as Holmes and Watson and for this we can be thankful. After a stumbling opening, the repartee between them improves and the actors deliver some clever, witty lines.<br /><br />Watson, newly married is now the target of a new supreme criminal named Moriarty (Jared Harris), a professor of mathematics. Moriarty is set to get an early start on WW I by assassinating various politicians at a would-be peace conference. He is heavily invested in arms dealing and is backing the German Kaiser. Holmes is getting in his way so he threatens the death of Dr. Watson and his bride as a result. Noomi Rapace (The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\\") is Simza a Gypsy whose brother is believed to be one of the assassins. There really isn't much to her role and just seems to be along for the ride.<br /><br />There are the interesting special effects we saw in the first \\"Holmes\\" where \\"Sherlie\\" (his brother's nickname) anticipates the next moves of an opponent when found in a precarious situation and thinks his way through his resulting action. There is also an exciting scene when Holmes and his small band escape from a building holding Moriarty's arsenal. The professor and his henchmen haul out the big cannons and deliver a volley at the running good guys through a snow ensconced forest. Director Guy Ritchie brings out the super slow motion to show the bullets whizzing by, nicking trees and body parts. Very effective. In the end however, this is a showcase for Downey and Law's well written banter. Not a great movie but very entertaining.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I love Stephen King.  He is one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />With that said I found this story lame.  It was like he wanted to just write a short story and did.  There was no real thought put into it.  No real plot.  No intense moments.  Nothing.  The characters were bland and the story line was really lame.  The whole entire story was practically told in the book description so save your money and just read the description.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I honestly can not remember a better movie than this in the recent past. I have never saw a character portrayed perfectly as Rooney Mara portrays Lisbeth in this movie. After reading the book after a friend suggested it to me I rushed to see the Swedish version and I loved it. When I heard of the American version being made I was skeptical but I went to see it anyways and I must admit I loved it even more. Never has a story captivated me as much as these books since The Lord of the Rings. I love the character of Lisbeth and my only wish I take from this movie is that David Fincher the movie's Director would have directed the movie adaptations of Dave Brown's The Da Vinci Code & Angels and Demons so that they too would have been brought to the screen the way they were meant to be portrayed!!! Love this movie and honestly in my opinion it goes:<br /><br />1. The Godfather Part I<br />2. Forest Gump<br />3. The Color Purple<br />4. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo<br />5. To Kill a Mockingbird<br /><br />That is how much I love this movie. I put it into the class of those great movies mad before it. It fits right in if you ask me.
B001PPGKRG|5.0|I'm going to go out on a limb and commit heresy here - Handel's keyboard suites are a more enjoyable listen than Bach's suites/partitas.  It could be the fantastic treatment they are given here by Ragna Schirmer, I don't know.  I just know that I can't stop listening to the 3 discs.  They don't wear you out with intellect, yet they aren't brainless diddies.  Sophisticated without trying your patience.  Ms Schirmer certainly accounts for a large part of the enjoyment, as she's not afraid to breathe non-harpsichord life into the pieces.  I was encouraged to seek this recording out due to Murray Perahia's Handel & Scarlatti set, which I specifically bought for the Scarlatti - yet I found myself listening more to the Handel.  It is informative to compare the Perahia to the Schirmer, as I guess it always is when comparing 2 great artists' interpretations.  Both are piano, and yet you'd almost believe they were playing from 2 different scores.  Not to rank one over the other, impossible.  However, a project like this must require the artist to steep themselves in the music for a longer period - get more inside it, in a way.  In any case, this is certainly more than an academic run through; you get the feeling that Schirmer has found the pianistic soul of the pieces - reinvented them.  And oddly enough, though the first set of 8 seem to be more well known, I find the second set of 8 are more enjoyable here - they dominate the first half of the presentation.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is great for a gift. I purchased it for myself and liked it so much that I purchased another one for my sister. You'll enjoy every song!!!
0385737955|2.0|I'm technically older than the target audience this book was trying to reach, which may be a part in my not enjoying the story and that someone much younger, maybe in their early teens, would enjoy the book just fine.<br /><br />That being said, I've been on a kick with young adult novels, especially dystopian ones, as sort of a guilty pleasure as I've noticed alot of older readers have been lately. And I've enjoyed books like the Hunger Games, Divergent and am currently working on Cinder and I've loved these stories and characters alot and felt like the writing style in each of these books is really good.<br /><br />With the Maze Runner, I felt the story was maybe \\"blah\\" for lack of a better word, I thought the characters were bland and not compelling, I wasn't attached to any of them (except maybe Chuck). The main character Thomas was actually rather irritating and I did not enjoy reading about him at all and found him grating on my nerves.<br /><br />The story itself was rather plain, much of the book was kinda boring to me and the writing style leaving something to be desired to catch much interest.<br /><br />I was able to finish the book in a day and a half, but I'm not interested in purchasing the rest of the series.
B002RKSCA6|3.0|Kept me interested. I really enjoyed this book. It is a must read. It was what you can expect for free. just got a lot of free books.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think its fun and entertaining<br />I play on the plane. a lot makes me want to buy the full version.
1594203334|4.0|There are some interesting ideas here.  Obviously our American style of parenting has produced some pretty creative and self-sufficient individuals, but there is also lots that appeals about other cultures, in this case, French culture.  Overall, some good food for thought.
0439023521|5.0|My best friend read all three books a couple months ago and was going on and on about how great they were. I couldn't believe 1) that she was this enamored with a young adult fiction novel and 2) that the book could actually be good when the premise seemed so grim. Well now that I've read books 1 and 2 (and am savoring book 3) I totally get what she was saying. These books are easy to read, exciting, intriguing, and pretty much a train-wreck-type plot: you just can't look away. Collins creates believable, lovable, engaging characters who are flawed and real. Enjoy the game and may the odds be in your favor.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I can only say the story is sadistic, violent and no depth. There is no growth either in storyline or the main charactor. The most disturbing thing is that so many people think such a cold blood killing full of darkness story is wonderdul. And I got really bored by reading this book, time wasted.

0788812807|5.0|Even though I'm in my 60's it was great to watch this movie again.  You never get to old for a good Disney movie even though it's animated.  This one is a classic----one thing even the youngest kids remember is that famous \\"KISS\\" between them.  The Tramp proved himself to be a hero & found a wonderful home finally.  Ever wonder what dogs say to each other like in the movie or think?  If we could explore what goes on in their minds we, humans, could probably learn a lot.

I also have dropbox and sugarsync which are great also.
B003TH2LA8|5.0|Legend of the Seeker, is a fantasy/fairytale series filled with adventures, battles between the forces of evil and good, an extremely likable cast, add in wizardry, magical domains and a very compelling story line, and you've got an extremely well executed enjoyable show.<br /><br />Once Upon a Time has also been one of my favorite shows, but I am finding legend of the seeker to be more filled with adventure and excitement, and I never got bored with it (something I cannot say for Once Upon a Time, which at times can get tedious for me).<br /><br />There are not many shows which are this fun to watch. Two thumbs up for Legend of the Seeker for making you feel like a kid again.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Read the first chapter on Amazon and will most likely read all 3 books but only because they are free with Prime.<br /><br />The author wrote with a 4th grade vocabulary about an adult theme. 100 years ago Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote better and they are now considered childrens fiction. There is more Blood Sex and Gore in any of Burroughs books.<br /><br />Rowlings reading these must laugh when she realized how easy she could have written HP if she simplified the book.<br /><br />If you want your teenagers to read at that level buy the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew otherwise tell your school to teach High School English not elementary.

B005GPFDQK|5.0|I am a HUGE Duran Duran fan and this is by far one of the best albums they have put out in awhile. Since I am fairly young (20), I was not around for the whole vinyl era so I am slowly trying to build up my own collection. This is a wonderful addition! The fast shipping was an added bonus. Got my package the DAY AFTER I ordered it. Great item; a must-have for any hard-core Duranie!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I viewed the prior Swedish version, first. I was really hoping to be equally enthralled by this version.  I liked it ... But, wasn't captivated in the way that the Swedish version traps you until it's done.<br /><br />The performances by Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara save the film. But, the film spends too much time with talking heads; shocker exploitation moments; and travelog vistas  ...  and too little time with coherent plot development. The key elements of the story are present. But that is just what it looks like .... key moments stitched together, without coherent development; transitions: a series of broken segues.<br /><br />Perhaps, if I hadn't seen the Swedish version, first; I would have expected less. The new video is worth seeing; but, if you only have money for one version, choose the Swedish film.[[ASIN:B003TTWJJO The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (English subtitled)]]

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I purchased this a year ago through Apple, which at the time was less expensive than Amazon. While there were third-party camera connectors available at the time, there were also a lot of reviews indicating that these might not work reliably, if at all. I chose to play it safe.<br /><br />My girlfriend often shoots golf tournaments and church retreats. She uses both a Nikon D90 and a Nikon D200 for this. Understandably, the participants at such events wanted to see how the pictures came out. Since they seemed to cope poorly with the idea of delayed gratification, we wanted a quick way to transfer the pictures from the cameras to an iPad 2.<br /><br />Apple provides two connectors. The first is for cameras like the D200, which uses a Compact Flash card. The second is more suitable for cameras like the D90, which uses an SDHC card. In this case, we link the camera directly to the connector with a USB cable.<br /><br />Both connectors have worked flawlessly with the Nikons and an iPad 2. The iPad has no difficulty whatsoever recognizing the pictures on the card or camera and facilitating their transfer. This makes instant slideshows a possibility, and using the iPad to display them is much more effective than inviting others to view the tiny rear view camera screens.<br /><br />So I can highly recommend this item.
B005HJU7HA|3.0|First, the good:  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's amazing tales of Holmes and Watson are an absolutely wonderful read, and really capture the imagination.  They are considered classics for a reason; the tales are intriguing and fast-paced.  The interactive table of contents is extremely helpful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some major problems.  First and foremost, just after a Study in Scarlet, it somehow happened that a chunk of the Mormon religious text made it in.  It took me about 5 minutes of reading to realize that something was wrong, and I had seen a review that had mentioned this problem.  I thought it was someone messing around, but they were telling the truth: the Book of Mormon somehow found its way into this ebook.  It isn't too much of a problem, if you know it's there it is a simple matter of skipping straight ahead to The Sign of the Four in the Table of Contents.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a decent copy for the pricing.  There are a few minor grammatical errors here and there, from what I can tell there are some errors in the arrangement of the short stories, and the Book of Mormon excerpt was a bit frustrating.  On the whole, however, the pricing and quality of the Sherlock stories themselves makes up for, in part, some of the formatting errors.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I purchased this bag a year ago for use with a Flip Mino camcorder. It has seen constant use since then, and it is still essentially in new condition with no signs of wear. It has also seen duty as a carrying case for an iPod Touch, and it handles that well, too.<br /><br />The bag uses very substantial vinyl material with very solid seams. The main compartment can accommodate both a power adapter and a small camcorder. It has other zippered compartments that hold cables, ear buds, supplemental lens, and similar stuff. The shouldER strap makes it very easy to just sling this over a shoulder while leaving both hands free, so you can carry this while also using your camcorder.<br /><br />The overall attention to materials and construction is very similar to what I see on Case Logic products, but the relatively low price tends to undercut Case Logic's pricing. All in all, this is a real bargain. Highly recommended.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is great on two levels.  First, as a scientist, I am impressed by the author's expose of bad science and how preconceptions can cloud scientific interpretations (glad I don't work in such a politically charged discipline).  Second is the result of that preconception, an epidemic of disease.  Taubes lays out a carefully mapped story explaining that we've been lied to regarding nutrition and health.  This is a highly recommended read.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The game is fun but 3/4 of the time it crashes my phone.  I could even put up with that but it also lost my save data and I needed to start over again.  There's also no quit or close button.  Pushing the home button in game usually causes my phone to do a soft reset.

B0078JPVGY|5.0|innovative, bloody, well created characters. This show is worth the jumps and adrenaline rush. Don't be scared of the zombies, they only want to eat you.
B005IS565S|5.0|This is an amazing album from a very talented band. Unfortunately, I was mailed the unedited version and it was a present for my nephew. The picture and description do not say it is explicit, but be warned, this is the EXPLICIT VERSION!!!! I wasn't happy with Amazon when I got this in the mail the day before my nephew's birthday party and realized I wouldn't be able to give it to him...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|cool hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi high five loo :) why did I do that so its cool
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|i have coby kryos. have had a lot of apps. this one has been good. could be a little harder. kinda on the easy side
B006OCM0G0|5.0|co&oslash;l cool cool cool cool cool cool this game is awesome I am a level 10 just started playing 6 hours ago already got 6 friends on it. I recomand u 2 get it
1466401885|5.0|Okay, this book is obviously not for the young and immature. It has alot of profanity, fighting, and obsessive/rude behaviors. But, I, for one, am not immature and completely loved this book. I don't know if it's because I can relate to this book, or if it's because it's so romantic and fast-paced. America and Shep's side relationship was entertaining but was not wrapped up in the end like Travis's and Pidge's. This book is definitely worth the read. It's so good that I find myself asking in forums for books that are similar to it.<br />P.S. The cover is also SO beautiful
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Awesome game.....however lost all my data! Sucks ....would like to know what the deal is. starting to<br />regret this purchase.
B005HSL626|5.0|The game works extremely well. The ads aren't even distracting. They're barely ever popping up. I have it on my Kindle Fire and it's pretty much too good to be true for being free. I 100% suggest this app to all ages.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay so I pretty much have a collection now that I get, use, then ignore. I go back to this one, Gilad, and P90x more than others and Jillian and Gilad are the easiest to follow and stick with.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun times shared with all I expecially like the flying va-jjs and fecal matter... made me eat pickles and punch my cat
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Great game. so many levels. Enjoyed it very much. great job by the developers. give it a try.  well worth the price.
B006ZS7ZLS|2.0|This album was so bad I think it gave me cancer. These are the actual lyrics to one of the songs: Swinging in the backyard<br />Pull up in your fast car<br />Whistling my name<br /><br />Open up a beer<br />And you say get over here<br />And play a video game<br />I'm in his favorite sun dress<br />Watching me get undressed<br />Take that body downtown<br /><br />I say you the bestest<br />Lean in for a big kiss<br />Put his favorite perfume on<br /><br />Go play a video game
B0063IH60K|3.0|Like this due to the portability afforded by my Kindle Fire.  Due to the Fire's small size I can access this game while on travel.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is definitely one of the easiest ones. they have made this so convenient to use over multiple platforms and devices.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Have been more than impressed with this game!  When I initially saw it, I thought that it would be just another arcade type game that one could easily grow tired of.  The opposite has proven to be true.  As I progress further and further up the chain, I find each scenero more challenging than the last one.  Many of these require one to rethink tactics and adjust to an ever changing situation.  Am about 75% through game one and enjoying the hell out of Angry Birds!  Since it is on my Kindle Fire, it will be easy to carry around and access while I'm traveling.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I've been playing for extended periods and have not had it FC once. So, they must have fixed that issue. That said, I'm not sure why I keep playing it. It seems like you just have to guess at matching elements until you find some and keep going. I still want to play it for some odd reason but I'm not sure why.
0452285186|1.0|I didn't want to rate this book at all I just wanted to send my sympathies to the author and all the (5-star) reviewers who think this book is humorous.  I have a great sense of humor, but I find NOTHING funny about suicide, and I'm sorry that you all do.  Cartoon  bunnies doing it doesn't change the concept.  Making fun of, encouraging, and promoting any kind of suicide is WRONG!!  I feel sorry for the authors young son (who is now following in his footsteps) and all the reviewers who have children.  What would you do if YOUR child committed suicide?  I know you wouldn't be laughing about it then.  Unless of course you read enough of andy riley's garbage and become one of the many sick twisted people in the world.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Doodle God is fun game. I think people including me thought it would be easier bit its not. The quotes are always funny and the pictures are very simple. The only thing i would change is how you combine the elements to make a new one. And what happened to free???
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am a huge Plants vs Zombies fan so I immediately downloaded it for my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus running ICS 4.0.2.  The game played fine for a few minutes so I quit out and went about my day.  Later on I went into the game to play and it would crash after a few minutes of playing.  I pulled my battery and rebooted my phone and it continues to crash after 2-5 minutes of playing.  This is a major disappointment as I am beyond the return period and have spent money on something that claims to be compatible but is not.<br /><br />EDIT:  It took them a while but the program works fine and is a blast to play!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|the game is a time waster! it is very addictive but very fun. it take a while to get leveled up but worth it!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I downloaded this app for writing my fanfics, and its amazing. I love it. I cant believe I have been missing out on this app.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|on android market this is free, but on kindle fire it's three dollars but its worth it :) very pleased (*'_'*)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I now own all four of the angry bird games and this is a fun, refreshing change to the series! Game play firing trajectory is offered but is not exact but offers you a good idea of how they fly. Pay attention to the location of the pigs as you may have to fire &quot;backwards&quot; to get to them. I love the change and the gravity changes that  make you think a tad bit more then the others that feature traditional straight shooting. Love this game and can't wait for more levels!
B006B3975Y|4.0|Short but beautiful in poetic darkness about a fictional person surviving in a world that can be harsh at times. This could easily become a film with this music playing in the background, my only small dislike is the quick short songs after Tip the Scale. I don't why their fans would hate this, it isn't bad but I guess it doesn't have that b-boy/hip hop type feel to it, it is cinimatic. Even though the 14 tracks makes it a LP, it has an EP length to it, so $10 or $11 is as far you should spend for this.
0439023521|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the Hunger Games. I had several friends who recommended the book. It is a very quick read! I read it in about 4 hours on a Sunday morning / afternoon. Good book for an entertaining read which doesn't require a lot of thought. No major subplots or tons of characters. It's definitely meant for a young reader (pre-teen to teen) but it's enjoyable for all ages!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I played this game for free on a pc flash games site, and thought then that it would be ideal for an android/iphone device - and it is.<br />I had problems with it crashing after I had progressed to a certain point in the game - then saw that the Amazon App Store had an update available.  Download the update, problem goes away.  Gotta love support like that - yes, problems suck, but as long as the developer continues to support the game, and provides a path to fix errors, I'm perfectly fine with the result.<br /><br />All in all, it's a wonderful little casual game, giving you pretty things to tappy-tap-tap while waiting for whatever it is you're waiting for.
0439023483|2.0|The author does a good job of creating suspense from the beginning.  But then, the characters that are actually in the fight to the death don't seem to be all that psychologically affected by their impending death. In fact, no one seems all that affected by it.  She barely touches on this issue at all.  You would think that they were just racing for a prize much less serious than life itself. I don't know why people think this is a good book. Not only do the characterize have to stay alive, but they have to try and kill each other.  But you'd think there was nothing but a trophy and bragging rights at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />The characters not well developed, and it's very predictable.  It was quite the let down.  I keep trying to find good stories with good writing.... I'm still looking. I'll see the other two on-screen.  But I will not be wasting my precious reading time on the rest of this trilogy.  It's not a good book, if while you're reading it, you can already envision the movie, and what actors will play which characters.
B001PSVQMC|5.0|\\"...Clairvoyants's Word To The Wise is a noble and impressive work of melodic heavy metal in the grand NWOBHM style. Sure, their foundation is in their Iron Maiden tribute work. Yet, this platter contains well crafted and highly entertaining original material which will not have you immediately saying, 'They just sound like Maiden.' In the end, this would be real success. Very recommended.\\" (Dangerdog.com - 4/5)<br /><br />\\"...Just like the Finns of Machine Men, Italy's Clairvoyants is an essential purchase for any Iron Maiden fan, or for that matter, any fan of the NWOBHM style. Every song is memorable with the exception of the one lame ballad \\"Closure\\". Brilliantly produced, wildly entertaining and loaded with catchy melodies and choruses, fans of traditional Heavy Metal will bask in the glow of Word To The Wise.\\" (Metalcrypt.com - 4/5)
B004EPZ07K|5.0|It's beautiful, I like the size. Looks great. It has an elegant fall. Came very well protected. They are easy to use. Combined in any occasion.
0545310598|5.0|The second book of a trilogy is often a bit difficult.  In the Star Wars trilogy, it was the best of the three.  In others, there seems to be a wandering and typically dark turn.  Catching Fire doesn't fit in any of these categories.  While everything is a bit darker and more sinister, the book picks up where book one left off and never slows down.  Katniss is quite the sensation and is stealing the spotlight - which the authorities don't like and the Districts love.  A new higher level of conflict arises and Katniss is back to battle again.<br /><br />I find that Ms. Collins writing is just as wonderful as the first book.  This is a quick read simply because you won't be able to put it down.  My whole family has read the series and eagerly await the movies.  This series is a 'must read'.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o fast paced<br />o exciting action<br />o wonderful characters who you really love to love and love to hate<br /><br />Cons:<br />o too short... I so wanted more...<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book to you.  A wonderful continuation of a masterful trilogy.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I'm as big a fan of Angry Birds as the next guy, but after two years of the same thing the formula was definitely getting stale. Angry Birds Space takes that old recipe and mixes it up just enough to make it feel fresh and exciting, while still keeping it familiar enough so that long-time fans don't feel lost. Well done, Rovio! This, here, is a home run.
B00005ASOC|4.0|Old Scotsman teaches young black kid about writing. Ray Charles could see where this is going, but when you want to feel good about humanity and don't want to think too much, watch this--it entertains.
0307454568|1.0|First Book was hard to get into until 1/3 way in.  Second book kept me going.  Both books did have many characters which I found hard to keep up with.  BUT THIS book was way over the top with WAY too any characters, Way too many agencies, and Way too much background information on everyone.  I finally said, I can't possibly keep up with all these people, so I went to the last few pages and read the end.  NOW I WAS FINALLY DONE.  Then I googled, Summary of Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest, and it was right on.  I actually got all the information in reading for 5 minutes.  The story was very interesting so I wanted to see how it all would end.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Having read \\"Secret and Confidential\\" in the 90's this movie is a perfect follow-up. It helps completing the history of the 20th century they do not teach us in school.
B004P5RMZ2|5.0|The only reason this deserves a 5 star rating is because the DVD includes the original film without the sci-fi graphics of the Director's Cut.<br /><br />The interviews themselves are good in the Director's Cut portion of the DVD, but the songs work better when played in the Original format.<br /><br />This is Pink Floyd at its best, and I can watch this film over and over again and never be disappointed.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I don't mind metal music so much, and in fact, I was a huge Metallica fan in the 80s.  However, most metal fans that I've encountered in my life are some of the most closed-minded individuals that I've ever met.  Especially when it comes to music.  Most of what they like sounds exactly the same.  They've got no tolerance for experimentation.  They've got no vision.<br /><br />This isn't, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect album.  It actually does make me laugh to hear James Hetfield singing \\"I am the table!\\"  However, this album isn't anywhere near as bad as people will have you believe.  I think it's actually pretty good.  I like music that challenges me and makes me think about it.  If nothing else, Lulu succeeds at that task.<br /><br />These butthurt Metallica fans who are rating this album 1 star are in their own world.<br /><br />That's okay, because this album is in its own world, too.
B00006JU7T|5.0|The term \\"Based on a true story\\" is used very loosely in films these days, i.e. The movie \\"Open Water\\" and too many others.  This movie really captures the times of it's subject. This movie works both as a showcase of the talent of an early Al Pacino and as protrayal of a true American hero, Frank Serpico.  Both men are well served by this film, as is the viewer.
B0019N94X6|1.0|I love Scarface and would love to see it on Blu-Ray, but this disc will not load on my LG BD-590. At all. I have updated the firmware, unplugged and tried again, unhooked it from the internet, and carefully check the disc for dust. Nada. Most expensive coaster I have ever bought. I have a complaint in with Universal customer support. If they don't make it right I will request a return to Amazon. I have read other people having skips and stalls, so I have to wonder if this is a bigger problem, but obviously some people are able to watch it, given the other reviews.<br /><br />I will say, if you review this as a \\"Terrible movie\\"...well, it's kind of like being someone who hates hot sauce and complaining about the \\"Burn you twice\\" Buffalo Wings you ordered. This movie is iconic...even in it's tackiness. If you did not know that when you bought it, welcome back to planet earth, and be glad it's not inhabited by talking apes.
0767903862|5.0|\\"....Beware the Jabberwock, my friend - with teeth that bite and claws that catch!\\"......(Lewis Carroll)<br /><br />If there indeed was a \\"Jabberwock\\", it would surely be found somewhere in the Austrailain outback, and Bill Bryson would just as surely have either read about or run afoul of one as he plunged into the wilderness, testing friendships, his own endurance and sunstroke along the way, oftentimes without suitable liquid refreshment come five o'clock.<br /><br />From the first colonies at Botany Bay *courtesy of the British and Newgate Prison\\" to present day cities along a splendid coastline of Great Barrier Reef, Bryson gets to the bottom of it despite leaving some of his best notes under the table at a pub he finally found .  Aborigines that could give the Freemason Secret Signal.  Beautiful cities such as  Canberra, which resembled a beautiful residential park from one end to the other, but no restaurants or pubs to be found anywhere, it would seem  - a Grecian Tragedy Australian style no less, in Bryson's eyes after a fruitless mega mile walk searching for one.<br /><br />On to \\"The Other Outback Facilities\\" of a different sort altogether, those remote public establishments erected at the direction \\"of the even lesser God\\".  Dimly lighted and dingy, with no reason to expect much business, the desk clerk's silhouette behind the counter resembling nothing so much as  \\" a ping pong paddle\\" (pg 236) after coming in from the outside glare - whose only comment to a question (or complaint) was \\"well, the bed's dry, ain't it?)<br /><br />And then there was Spinifex and Bulwaddy.  (Yes, that's right, Lewis Carroll - you've been upstaged again.)  Spinifex is a glamorous appearing grass that is completely useless as fiberglass and bulwaddy is an equally curious bush, both sort of like virtual mirages but uncomfortable if waded out into.  This is but a fraction of what he encounters on his trip, all of it wild and wonderful.<br /><br />Not the least is the constantpossible contact with instant mortality.  With all the available ways to die with honor in Australia (taipan, box jellyfish, cone snail, toxic spiders, crocodiles, inattentive snorkeling guides, etc.) Bryson and his long-suffering friend almost met their demise unceremoniously in the middle of the Outback, on an expanse of dirt road empty of automobiles for a thousand miles in either direction - except for one, obviously having gone asleep at the wheel just before meeting them....the friend had gone along simply to keep Bryson from self-destructing alone in the Bush and was almost rewarded for his concern.....<br /><br /><<<< ...\\"there passed an instant made up in equal parts of horn blare, muted shrieks and wild, tight swerves; I could see perfectly our unwitting assailant, frozen, looking at us with a mixture of bewilderment and apology.....our cars passed somehow without colliding...\\" (pg 248)<br /><br />It's a wonderful travelog of Australia, written with the Bryson levity and packed with adventure from the \\"land down under\\".  It's the next best thing to taking the trip yourself, without the inconvenience of having your happy hour jerked away when you least expect it.  Having already been bewitched by \\"A walk in the Woods,\\" I knew I wanted to read this one too and I was not disappointed.
0811870413|5.0|update after almost 6mos of break baking ;-)<br /><br />- love these recipes from the book: pesto, croutons, salad, and pizza recipes<br />- my starter is better than ever, i keep it in the frig and refresh it maybe once a month at most.  to make the leavening, i take 2 spoonfuls straight out of the fridge and mix it with water and APF, and it poofs up by the end of the day in a warm spot in the house<br />- i only bought the iron combo skillet & razors as i already have the scale and larger plastic tupperware.  to let the dough rise before baking, i just use a bowl and a towel to cover<br />- my preferred flour mix: ~60% BF, 20% APF, 10% WWF, 5% flax seed meal, 5% of potato flour & milk powder<br />- the book doesn't directly say it, but you can do both bulk and final rise in the fridge.  this is especially great for weekday baking if one is working.  the schedule i like is:<br />day1 - make the leavening in the morning before work.  mix the dough and put it in a container in the fridge at night<br />day2 - fold in morning and night, stays in the fridge<br />day3 - fold in the morning, put back in the fridge.  at night, shape/rest/fold, then put in a bowl covered with a towel & put in the fridge<br />day4 - bake in the morning for breakfast<br /><br />you can also stretch out the day2/day3 by a day to shape/fold in the morning to bake in time for dinner<br /><br />you will not want to eat other breads after making this one!<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />i've never made bread before until i got this book.  the 1st 3 tries, my bread didn't rise much, but the flavor was very good.  finally got it right on the 4th try, and realized my leavening wasn't ready because the house temp was too cold.  now i've baked 2 more times with success, i'm in the process of trying out different methods to make it work with my schedule.<br /><br />my friends rave about my bread now.  couldn't havedone it without this book!
B0073PZIYI|1.0|First off I would like to make note of the very bad acting in all the people involved in the movie. Second this was a bad idea to watch. Please do not buy the  hipe on Justin Timberlake as some tough guy, because he is not. Thank for you attention.
1451683405|2.0|This book was a brief rehash of previous Sam Harris work, specifically what he wrote in 'The Moral Landscape'.<br /><br />Yes, I think he may be right. I personally cannot imagine the physical (non-supernatural) mechanism by which free will could exist. Dennett tries and his idea that free will is an evolutionary emergent phenomena with increased \\"evitability\\" is intriguing. I remain unconvinced on that score, because it seems to me what Dennett describes is great complexity rather than free will per se.<br /><br />Be that as it may, 'Free Will\\", at some 66 pages including notes, provides little in the way of concrete neuroscience to prove Harris's point -- while it may be a serious philosophical work, it is neither rigorous nor comprehensive.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I started with level one today and I enjoyed it and can see that with continued use I will see results.  With the warm-up and cool-down, you are looking at a total of about 25 minutes, and in that time I burned 188 calories (I have a heart rate monitor).<br /><br />About Me:<br />I am 35 years old, 5'7\\", and have been working out consistently since December (3-4 days a week), but I am not new to working out - I have been off and on for years.  Sometimes I work out at home, most times I work out at the gym taking either 60 minute classes (step aerobics, weightlifting classes, Zumba) or using my favorite app on my iPhone, Nike Training Club, to do strength and circuit training, as well as ab work exercises.  I was not overweight, but I was close to or quite possibly over 165 lbs before December and I am now 149 thanks to exercise AND diet.  I also used a calorie tracking app which helped me watch what I ate.  Now, I'm trying to lose nine \\"vanity\\" pounds, and need to change my eating habits as well as try different workouts which is why I decided to try JM's 30 Day Shred.<br /><br />I said all the above not to brag or plug iPhone apps, but to say with all that I do, and in the shape I am in, THIS WORKOUT ISN'T FOR BEGINNERS!  This is why you have reviews from people who are gym rats and exercise buffs who find it hard to keep up.  I think this DVD is best for those that have been working out consistently for at LEAST a couple of months, mainly because you will need the stamina, strength and energy, as well as knowing how to do the moves correctly.  I would NOT recommend this for anyone who has never had the help of a personal trainer or a class instructor to show them how to do exercise moves properly (or at least a friend who can tell you if it looks like you are doing it wrong).  I can understand why people have complained of back and knee problems - THEY PROBABLY AREN'T DOING THE MOVES CORRECTLY.  Even when I am in the gym, I have seen people arch their backs when they are doing back rows, or pushing their knees over their feet when they are doing squats and lunges - no wonder people complain about their knees bothering them with this workout.  Another important fact I failed to mention is that I too have bad knees - I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis as a child, and although the doctors say I no longer have it, I constantly have knee pain.  But because I have been working out hard for the past several months, I have gradually strengthened the muscles in my thighs (which is what the doctor advised), which helps take the pressure off of my knees, and I can now do lunges and squats(after a good warm-up) a little bit better than before.<br /><br />I'm giving it four stars and not five because I can see how doing this every day can quite possibly bore me.  I'm used to going to the gym and taking classes where no two classes are the same, so for me to do the same workout (at least until I'm ready to go to level 2) for days on end will probably bore me.  Other than that, I have no problems with the workout.<br /><br />I would also like to comment on those who had issues with the cool-down.  The cool-down is just enough to get your heart rate down, but I highly recommend you stretch for an additional 10-15 minutes after the DVD is over.  Use the internet to find some good stretches if you don't know what to do.  Even after my exercise classes at the gym, I go to the stretch area and continue cooling down and stretching for another 10-15 minutes. It helps because you won't be AS sore, and you will also help prevent injuries, plus bonus - you will become more flexible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game. its a really good way to pass the time. I think that everyone would like this game!!!
0307957934|2.0|If you're a fan of Robert Harris, as I have been, do not waste your money or time on this book.  It will make you wonder what you saw in that author.  Oh, yeah...great earlier books like Pompeii and almost all the others.  Perhaps Harris should stick to historical fiction, because as a thriller writer...at least in this instance...he is completely lost.  What did he do, phone this one in?  The plot is ludicrous, and is so clumsily written it evokes a \\"who cares\\" reaction throughout.  His writing style, always impeccable before, is on par with a high schooler here. Similes are trite, dialog is astonishingly bad, characters are all unlikable, and the plot--which takes forever to move into forward gear--is hopelessly laughable.  Even the ending is a big disappointment in every respect but one: it ends the misery of reading this sad effort, which is the only good thing I can say.  Robert Harris, what happened?  This is not up to your earlier standards, not up to the publisher's standards either, for that matter.  A computer that takes over with a life of its own?  What did it do, take over the printing presses at Knopf and attach your name to its first novel?  That, least, would be a plausible explanation.  More plausible than your plot.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Loved it. What an imaginative story. Wool was a great read that I didn't want to put down, right to the very end. I didn't want it to finish.

B00005JL3A|3.0|It's a sci-fi/horror-action film about a sprawling, secret undeground research facility where illegal and dangerous scientific experiments are taking place.  Naturally something goes wrong.  A SWAT team is sent in to figure out what happened.  They figure out they are in over their heads, and spend the rest of the movie fighting their way out.  That's basically it.<br /><br />Insofar as these types of films go, this one isn't terrible.  It does have its strengths.  Being underground for the majority of the film, there is a creepy, middle-of-the-night atmosphere to it that kind of works (kind of).  And the lead actress, Milla Jovovich, has a certain presence that works because she manages to be tough and gorgeous at the same time.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is no depth to the plot, or the characters.  The dialogue is cringe-worthy at times (e.g. \\"These people used to WORK here!\\"), and for an action film, the action is pretty tame.  It's also worth noting that the zombies are not particularly scary.<br /><br />If you are in the mood for a simple, cheap guilty pleasure to watch late at night when you can't sleep, this film is decent.  However, if you are looking for something challenging, unique, or moving, you probably won't like this movie.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love the new space angry birds totally awesome! Lots of fun for the whole family. Fresh new game approach. Only two bummers that make it 4 star. The price is high for hd and the hd on the kindle fire is nice but small for me.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|This is an absolutely great movie.  It pokes fun with a 'you've got to be kidding' approach to the world of competetive Ball Room Dancing, while at the same time purveying the message 'A life lived in fear is a life half-lived' when it comes to doing your own thing.<br /><br />  There is the beginner 4-eyed ugly duckling who is enamored with the established dashing male.  Through abject contact learning new moves and practising in secret, the male begins to see beyond the exterior of the female and a love begins to stir.  This is a forbidden love as the male can only win the coveted Pan-Pacific competition by dancing with a 'known' partner, dancing only approved steps.<br /><br />  In the end, true love prevails, but not until after the female blooms into a stunner and the show has ran through a most excellent soundtrack of favorites.  Many of the tunes will surprise you, not only for their selection, but also for the arrangements used.<br /><br />  If you love good music, the underdog winning, and true love in the end, then this movie is for you.
B007MC868M|5.0|When I first started reading this latest Harry Hole novel, my hopes sank a little. It's about a new drug (called violin, a bit sad for me as I play the violin), drug smuggling, and the control of drugs in Oslo. I've never been one for stories on drugs and drug rings, (exception claimed for the tv show Breaking Bad), it's just something I'm really not interested in. But as Nesbo's brilliant writing kicked in and the plot took form I was hooked and couldn't put it down. As the story develops it becomes so much more - about family, relationships, morals and ethics, life and death. Nesbo is so skilled at laying clues and plot footholds as the novel progresses they don't even register. His ability to investigate the motives of the litany of characters drives the complex plot with its twists and turns, which leaves you puzzled, guessing (mostly wrongly) and breathless - and absolutely stunned at the climax.<br /><br />As for the story itself, I don't won't to give away too many spoilers so will only say that Harry flies back into Oslo for the only reason that would bring him back, someone he loves is in trouble, and that's Oleg, who is now 18. It's a great relief to see Harry sober, although still fighting his demons, so that he can sort out the huge mess Oleg has gotten himself into. Poor Harry is put through the wringer again, but at least he and Rakel get to rekindle their romance whilst Rakel's boyfriend obligingly cools his heels.<br /><br />Harry books into the Hotel Leon, where an old retired vagrant of a pastor is living in the room next door, who likes nothing more than to chew his arm off and take his cigarettes. A murdered teenager tells us his story as he lays dying, and slowly most of the pieces of what has happened come together. A Russian drug lord has a couple of new gruesome and ingenious ways of doing away with his enemies. A Norwegian native gets in on the drug manufacturing with disastrous consequences. The gorgeous Mikael Bellman has been promoted to head of Orgkrim, but he's still not entirely trustworthy. There's a `burner' in the police force, an astonishing concept I've never heard of, and a woman councillor whom I'm never sure is a woman or not.<br /><br />I'm usually spot on in picking who-dunnit, but I missed nearly every clue (although I did get one), and certainly did not see the end coming. Now that I have finished the book I have found myself flipping back to reread the clues that I missed, and I still think there is one thing left unfinished (hopefully for the next book!). I think I need to read the whole book again. I'm only sorry that I will probably have to wait another year for Jo Nesbo's next book. This is a great story, vicious and heart-rending all in one, which makes it unforgettable. I think it is Nesbo's best yet. Surely to be a movie. It's worth more than 5 stars.head of Orgkrim, but he's still not entirely trustworthy.

B005DF2QMC|4.0|installed the software, loaded the tape and almost immediately started the conversion. No major issues, worked very well espically for the price.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A wonderful collection of 5 books, Wool 1-5 tells of a post apocolyptic world where the survivors are deliberately kept ignorant of the state of their world, only images are piped in of the deadly landscape that is no longer fit for human consumption. An engrossing tale that questions how far would you go to remake the world in your grand image? If freedom meant death, would you take it anyway or would you beat down your own sense of right and wrong? Become a slave? Be deliberately ignorant? Would you swallow lies and half-truths and save a portion of that bitter meal for your children?<br /><br />I really loved this collection and am waiting with much anticipation for the next book. I just have to know what Silo 40 is up to!
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|This is a good movie, I definitely enjoyed this different view of Tinkerbell.  She in an energetic, enthusiastic tinker fairy and is definitely a better character for girls to watch rather than Barbie.  I have not seen the other Tinkerbell movies, but will try to see them now.  The music is nice and the animation is great, not condescending.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Having the ability to share my documents with myself no matter where I am is the coolest idea ever. I wish I would have thought of it! Evernote is the easiest &amp; most organized app for file sharing I have discovered so far AND it has the ability to create little notes to jot down my ideas &amp; have it available to me anywhere. I can save web pages that I may want to access again. I love having the ability to create different notebooks for my many different personalities &amp; interests. I am sure there are even cooler aspects of this app that I haven't even discovered yet.

1594744769|2.0|I was excited to read this book. I thought it sounded very original and a great idea for a book, incorporating the old photo's into the story. I started reading it as soon as it arrived. It started out good and kept my interest but by the time I was half way through it I had to force myself to finish it. Maybe my expectations were to high but by the time I finished it I was glad it was over.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video to help with the last few post pregnancy pounds I couldn't seem to lose. I had been already working out 3 times a week for 30 min but wasn't losing weight. 30 days ago I started this video, completed it at least 5 days a week and now I am down 4 of the 5 pounds I wanted to lose. I did not follow the diet but did cut out junk food. At first I GAINED weight, likely do to the muscle building, but I stuck it out til the end and it was worth it. The workouts are about 25-28 minutes each including warm up and cool down. They are tough but managable. The intro is really long before workout 1 but it gets better after that. Jillian is pretty full of herself, but she does a good job. Overall, this was a great quick workout that helped me quite a bit.
0545259088|1.0|I had originally review the first book of this series Shiver and did not like it and completely forgot about it.  Which is why I was suddenly experiencing Deja Vu while reading this third novel and remembering the character.  Unfortunately nothing has improved, the characters are still one dimensional and not at all interesting.  I will make a note of this series in my reading journal in order to avoid it in the future.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started reading Catching Fire & couldn't stop.  My 13 year old son had it and was going on about how great it was.  He was talking about it going to be a movie, so I thought I would give it glance even though I had not read the first one & didn't really think I would like it.  Boy was I wrong.  He had to return the borrowed book, which left me having to buy my own copy because I was completely drawn in.  A week later my sister was asking if I had read the Hunger Games, it was apparently the talk of her office.  No, just like myself, I started with book number 2 & couldn't put it down.  The book gives enough background that I was not totally lost even though I hadn't read the first book.  I completely ruined the movie Breaking Dawn by reading the book first so I am not reading the Hunger Games until after I see the movie this weekend.  Catching Fire Was great.  It made me think about the possibilities the future could hold, and the harsh reality that exists in some countries now ( that those of us who are comfortable do not like to think about... Just like those in the Capital in the book).  I, like someone else I read DREAMED about the book after putting it down.  The book picks up after Katniss & Peta have won the games & are suppose to be living their happily, rich every after in the Victor's village.  They both give to the district they came from because of their generous hearts.  Katniss is doing her best to not anger the Capital & evil President Snow for her family's safety, but has unknowingly contributed to some uprising activity.  She finds herself & her loved ones in danger because of the uprisings she did not knowingly contribute to.  She can't just be killed because of her celebrity status as winner (or co winner with Peta) of the Hunger games.  This book is so heart wrenching and tells of how people fight to merely survive under a cruel, blood thirsty leader.  I thought the book would be a little too impossible for me to enjoy, but it really gets into the modern reality of so many things... Reality tv, cruelty to humans, government abuses, survival.... Human instincts, rebellion, love, bravery, so many real, true things so many of us do not want to see in society.  It was so disturbing on so many levels, yet offers hope on so many other.  I LOVED IT....the modern reality of so many things... Reality tv, cruelty to humans, government abuses, survival....

1451627289|4.0|At over 800 pages, 11/22/63 is a long novel.  Because of the subject, it needs to be long.  King does a great job in giving readers an idea of what it must be like to live in the past, the pleasant parts and the hazards.  However, he could not have done that had he not taken so many pages to present that past as seen through the eyes and senses of a man from the future.  Perhaps the best thing that can be said for any novel is that it is almost impossible to put down without reading a few more pages or another chapter.  That is true for this book.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I've read the books and i felt the show was faithful to the source material yet making changes necesary for the change of format to the small screen. Perhaps it's only flaw is too much blatant \\"sexposition\\" or the use of nudity and sex too often when it probably was not necesary. Yes the story has a lot of sex in it but at times it does seem a little over the top in this.<br />That said it does not take away from it be a great story that was very well done and very enjoyable.<br />The Blu Ray special features do a good job of giving you an indepth look into a very intricate world. For those that have not read the books it can add layers and more understanding to the viewing and for those who have not read the book in a while it can remind you some things you may have forgoten.

B003R0MF5I|5.0|This season of Chuck follow the same formula as Chuck Seasons 1-3. In the past, the show has focused on Chuck trying to stay alive (season 1), Chuck getting the girl and learning about his father (season 2), more of Chuck and his father and his girl (season 3).<br /><br />Season 4 opens up a lot more characters than just Chuck, Sarah (his girl) and his dad. This time, we get much deeper in Morgan's life. We get a first good glimpse into Casey's past life. And we also continue to look into the dark corners of Chuck's and Sarah's lives.<br /><br />The series hits some rough spots by including some horrible product placement spots. They were obviously aiming for an effect like the funny spots on Arrested Development, but it just ends up looking like begging and fund raising. Chuck pulls out a Tide stick and points the label at the camera and smiles. A scene starts with a car label that makes the show feel like it's the start of a commercial. And, of course, subway sandwiches are everywhere.<br /><br />It was a bit much.<br /><br />The season gets a bit boring somewhere around 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through, but then picks right back up.<br /><br />The show ends with a cliffhanger (as many do), so you'll definitely want to get the final season 5 after watching this one.
0385342063|5.0|As much as I have always enjoyed Sophie Kinsella's breezy and comedic writing style, I have to admit that her Shopaholic series was wearing thin (especially after she and Luke became parents to a completely obnoxious gimme gimme gimme kid). The plucky heroines in her non-Shopaholic books are more fully developed characters; Poppy, the frantic fiancee in \\"I've Got Your Number,\\" is no exception to this. While fans of the romantic comedy genre will recognize from the get-go that she's engaged to the wrong guy, watching Poppy edge toward this realization herself as The Big Day draws closer is a delightfully wacky ride. The supporting players are fun to watch as well, and Kinsella has injected enough silly visuals in this ticking clock tableau about impending matrimony that there's no shortage of date-night movie potential.
B0058SNI58|5.0|super cute for picking up the kids, going to the beach or a day on the boat (or at the mall) cute buy comfy!
0670022705|1.0|I am just finishing the book. It was a hard read after chapter 36, The Warren Cup. It depicts homosexuals with children. I think I lost my stomach on that one. Its not the homosexuality of adult men, but the children. I know even Pompeii had the prostitutes. I feel it is a poor reflection of our world history in 100 objects, but maybe there is room for the slums of our society.  The Warren Cup combines  homosexuality and the sexualization of children. The wealthy could afford to take advantage of children - homosexual or not. I see no beauty only flaunting of sexually deviation with children in society today or thousands of years ago. If it were only men - it is not disgusting, but with children - pornographic.  Is there really a place for sexual acts with children in our 100 objects of world history? I could be way off on this! Art? Really?  I think more like fringes of the warped.
B00406UK7S|3.0|I was really prepared to like this movie, I generally enjoy period movies from this era, and this one has the \\"look\\" down really well. Where it falls down is in some of the over-the-top combat sequences, with blood spraying everywhere, limbs flying, etc. There are very few men today who could lop off an arm or head with a backhand short-sword slash, so I'm not sure why these film directors think it was apparently commonly done by the smaller men of ancient times. Also, of course, we have the effortless sword thrusts straight through steel armor, and the usual model-slim warrior women easily defeating trained fighting men twice their size. One might wonder, given the apparently superhuman qualities of the Pict \\"barbarians\\" here, that the Romans were able to conquer much at all. They seem to power through any attack and ignore all wounds, plucking out arrows and fighting on. The truth is rather different, I suspect, with Roman discipline, training, organization, and standardized armor and equipment usually carrying the day in battles against less organized forces. While a few of the Roman soldiers here are sympathetic characters, one of the things that lets this film down is that most of them are not, and neither are their enemies, the dirty and brutal Picts. Much of the movie ends up being a chop-fest with no one giving much thought to why. If you like swords and adventure against a backdrop of bleak northern landscapes, you'll probably enjoy the movie, but if you're looking for likable characters with real humanity, you'll only find a couple in this picture.
B00555X8OA|5.0|While there are plenty of references on cognitive bias, including the excellent and entertaining site, YouAreNotSoSmart (also highly recommended), Thinking does the best job of any I've read of taking the entire field of behavioral economics and giving it a coherent overall context. Most others are just laundry lists of various biases. Kahneman does a great job through the book of presenting a compelling model of a human and how we make decisions and behave. His writing style is excellent; he routinely poses thought experiments that let the reader feel the visceral tugging of cognitive bias for himself. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

B00005RHGK|1.0|Has anyone else noticed something very creepy about these two films? I don't mean creepy in a good horror movie way, I mean creepy like odd and disconcerting. First of all, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is an \\"okay\\" horror film I guess, nothing original. But the thing that bothered me when I first saw these two movies is that there is a weird running theme that goes against normal movie convention. In Part 1, Justin Long plays the male protagonist but assumes the role of the \\"female victim\\". For some reason the creature becomes obsessed with him, starts stalking him and steals and sniffs his laundry. Isn't this what normally happens to the female protagonist in horror films? Unless of course the creature is gay. In Part 2, a bunch of high school football players and cheerleaders get stranded while traveling in a school bus. For some reason, the football players use this opportunity to take off their clothes and sun bathe on top of the bus. Huh?? How many men would do this? Isn't this what female characters normally do in horror films to achieve the obligatory T&A shots? Why aren't the slutty cheerleaders taking their clothes off? It gives a strange, uncomfortable quality to both movies. Later I found out the director was a convicted child molester who molested boys. NOW IT ALL MADE SENSE!! Suffice it to say, I immediately sold both movies for $.99, I didn't want it in my collection.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most AMAZING novels I have ever read! I won't spoil any of it, but it's truly amazing and the way it's written just makes the story so much more awe-inspiring. AND it was a signed copy! I got the J squiggle, and though I wanted the yeti (darn) I'm still happy with the signature! In the words of John Green, \\"If you don't absolutely love it, you can punch me in the stomach.\\" ;D
0439023513|5.0|I found Mockingjay to be a suitable ending for The Hunger Games series.  The pacing, as with the previous two novels, is breakneck.  Katniss and those close to her are endearing and loveable; it is heart-breaking to see so many of them die (but I won't say who!).  Sadness plays such a huge role in this book especially.  The protagonists are so well-written and believable, not to mention sympathetic--I may be in love with Peeta.<br /><br />If you're stalling reading this one because of the death count or overall despair, I would recommend to jump in and enjoy the ride, and cry some if necessary.  In my opinion, it's worth it.
0374275637|4.0|This was a very interesting and readable book by one of the founders of \\"Behavioural Economics.\\"  Despite winning the Nobel Prize for Economics (with Amos Tversky),<br />he isn't actually an economist.<br /><br />This was a fascinating book and it was very readable for the most part.  There were lots of notes and references in the back so it is quite rigorous as well.<br /><br />Much of the material is quite well known and has been featured in quite a few books before.<br />Though to be fair to the author it was often his theories and research in the first place.<br /><br />I did have a few small reservations.  Many people have questioned some of his interpretations of the results of his experiments, especially as to what extent they reveal people's irrationality and  also many people think that when conditional probabilities are expressed as frequencies many of these problems disappear.<br /><br />Despite these small quibbles I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot from it.

B005C7SXMS|5.0|Protaginist Oliver Tate and his love interest Jordana, have caputured not only my interested but also admiration as they are portrayed wonderfully from start to finish. With amazing cast work, wriiting and visual effects (bicycle ride anyone?) I feel privy to the private lives of this fantastic ensemble from the moment I met Oliver.<br />Trying to begin a relationship with a girl you're interested in is never easy, but add on the potential seperation of parents that have not had sex in 7 months and it's a wonder Oliver would even try in the first place. Yet he does and he navigates through the unexpected so well you'd think he'd done it before. Though he never truly loses his cool, he does manage to bring things alright in the end.

0061649694|5.0|Coraline was a gripping read!  The suspense and tension start out slow (with a sense of something-isn't-right-here), but they escalate as the story progresses, to the point of being deliciously gripping--and unsettling.  Also, Gaiman deftly weaves in a good dose of humor to give the reader some respite.  Coraline is an endearing protagonist, and the ending is very satisfying.  I would recommend this children's book even to adults!  Adults may have some additional appreciations for the novel, and may become nostalgic as well (I think many can relate to Coraline's curiosity and imagination).

0061998494|5.0|I am not even an active viewer of his TV show, but know his work from the Drew Caray show.  It was gifted last year and simply had not prioritized reading this book, but certainly glad I grabbed it while heading to catch a plane.  Craig's honesty and description are both absolutely hilarious yet poignant.  Highly recommended to anyone looking for a brief tale of a coming of age story.
0525478817|5.0|I knew from other reviews that this was going to be a sad story.  After all, it is the story of Hazel Grace and Agustus, two teenagers that have cancer. Although I knew it was going to be sad, I did not stop to think that it would teach me some new things about life.  Their story will give you a very clear picture of what it must be like for families with a loved one suffering from cancer.  It is even more tragic when that person is young and in love and should be enjoying life to the fullest. There were times when this story just seemed too real and I could not control my sobs, so make sure that you keep those kleenex handy.  I think that John Green did a wonderful job witing this book.  Even though it is a work of fiction, it did not feel like fiction, in fact it might have just seemed too real.    Full review at [...]
B004LWZW8S|2.0|The storyline was too simple, no surprises and not engrossing. The fight scenes were too short and did not show any real heroism. U just didnt fall in love with  Thesaeus, although Cavil's  acting was pretty good. There should have beeen more scenes to showcase the power of the bow. The gods are too weak, they got their butt kicked by the titans and have to run in the end.  300 with Gerard butler screaming \\" THIS IS SPARTA\\" still reigns as the one with the better plot. picture and action.

The huge number of reviewers is the best compliment.<br />I will not dwell into too many details because other people have done it very well and in great detail.<br />A very complex account of Steve's life, which left me inspired and enlightened about who he really was.<br />I am now waiting for the one on Bill Gates.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|Warning: Ready to shoot myself over this cliff hanger! So if this review is a little rambly (Yes making up my own word here) please don't take it out on me. I've just finished reading so I'm still getting over the book =)<br /><br />As you all know Pandemonium is the companion novel to the one and only Delirium. Which I hope you also all know that I liked it I'm just not a fan of these huge cliff hangers! So anyway the story is Love is illegal. If you fall in love your diagnosed with Deliria and basically if you get it they cure you but if they believe it's gone to deep they lock you up. Lena the main character of course in the beginning is following the rules and is going about getting her cure but then she meets Alex whom she falls in love with and that is where I stop telling you about the story if you want to know more go read it!<br /><br />Lena is a really cool character because at first she's not a rebel at all. She's scared of not following the rules and getting in trouble because of what happened to her mother. But she does over come her fears and fall in love which I'm glad about because everyone deserves to fall in love at least once because it truly is an amazing feeling.<br /><br />Now let me say what happened in this book I was so not ready for. But it wasn't totally hard to handle until the end which I can't talk about because I can't spoil it, but one of the things that I really liked about Pandemonium is all of the new characters. The big ones in particular are Raven she is the mother basically in the story she takes care of Lena when she's sick and hurt and gives her a place to sleep and be when she needs it the most. Raven basically gives Lena a whole new family.<br /><br />Next up we have Tack who we don't see a whole lot of but after they break apart from the other half of the group he Is the one that stays with Raven & Lena. He's sort of the hard headed guy who just wants to take care of his friends well family. We don't find out much about his past but I feel like he must have had a lot of heart break for him to be like that. I think it would be really interesting to have a little side story about Raven & Tack just like Lauren did one for Hana because I feel like there's something more to the two of their characters.<br /><br />Lastly the character that I didn't want to but I fell in love with is Julian. Now love is banned through out the whole book and the point is that Lena is falling in love anyways but this love is different because she's falling in love with the other side all most and I'm not going to elaborate on that again because of spoilers but I think you get the point. Julian is this sweet guy whose had a really rough life and he just wants to be left alone he doesn't want to risk his life with surgery anymore he doesn't want to hate his dad anymore he just wants to be normal and I have to say I think Julian deserves it because even though he's supposed to be on the other side he still understands Lena's side.<br /><br />Overall I give Pandemonium 4.5 out of 5 stars and the reasoning for that is because I can't get over these crazy cliffhangers because it just brings the end of the story down for me. The only good thing about it is that I need to get my hands on the next book now!past but I feel like he must have had a lot of heart break for him to be like that.

0385737955|4.0|The Maze Runner is a novel full of suspense and mystery, and it also possesses its fair share of action. This book is an amazing read because it has it all.<br />The story begins with our hero, Thomas, awakening within a large dark box with a rather nasty case of amnesia.he has no clue who he is, where he is, or anything he's ever done. Only his name. Thomas is a good character to read about because he is easy to relate to. Later in the story, he reacts to circumstances about how I would.<br />The large box soon elevates and opens up to a world that's rather peculiar. There are huge stone walls surrounding a small community of boys. Just boys. Thomas learns that the've been there for two years, and every month a nwcomer arrives, and every week, supplies arrive through the box -- the same way as Thomas. Surrounding the community is a seemingly unsolvable maze. What the residents of this \\"Glade\\" believe to be the way back to the lives they had before.<br />Thomas tries to adjust to his new life, but the next day -- meaning not on schedule -- a GIRL arrives through the mysterious box.<br />This story will have any reader turning pages faster than ever before; however, there are a few flaws. Thomas gains powers and abilities rather abruptly, but not so much so that he seems like an invincible superboy. It just makes the sory seem less developed.<br />I very much enjoyed my experiance reading this story. and i hope that you decide to purchase it after reading my review :)<br />By the way, I am not who it says reviewed this item, but I am Andrew C.

B004LWZW8I|1.0|I love Greek mythology and am a long-time fan of movies such as \\"Troy\\" and \\"300\\" but THIS.....is GARBAGE!!!!! Soon as I finished watching it, I threw the disc across the room, stomped on it and threw it in the garbage along with the case and all. Those of you who want to watch this, PLEASE....save your money!!!!! I regret seeing this!
B004I744AS|5.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire and L O V E it!<br />Removed the dictionary that 'came loaded'on the<br />KF and found this one and actually USE this one.<br />Excellent AND free...what is better than that?

B001SRC9P8|5.0|What would you do if your bestfriend went missing and was never seen or heard from again? Would you be heartbroken? Happy? Furious? Well four pretty girls from Rosewood, Pennsylvania know how it feels.<br />In the chilling but anticipated teen drama, Pretty Little Liars, Aria, Hanna, Spencer, Emily, and Alison have an end of the 7th grade year sleepover in Spencer's barn. While at the sleepover, Alison and Spencer get in an arguement and Alison gets mad and leaves- never to be seen or heard from again.<br />The story starts out about 3 years later. Alison is still missing and the four other girls have drifted apart. The only way they are brought back together again is by a very terrifying and twisted way.<br />My favorite part of the book would have to be the ending. It hits a climax you don't suspect at all. This book is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The plot is interesting and keeps you from wanting to put the book down. I highly recommend, if you like mystery, action, and suspense, this is the book for you!<br />  -Ashton Daniels(:
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Back in December-January, I was going back and fourth on wether I should buy the book. What won me honestly to finally get the book, and I know it's horrible, the upcoming movie. I personally like to read a book before seeing the movie (i think reading after the movie just destroys the book, waste of your time, and money) and the book was a really REALLY good read. I finished the book in one day and I wish I had bought the book early. For me, I could possibly read the book over again-that would be a first thats how good this book is. The next book to this one  Catching Fire which is basically the aftermath, so read it if you want to find that out. I also finished that within a day so its not a difficult or a long read unless you make it one.  I suggest if you have finished the hunger games you should also read catching fire within a couple of weeks of each other.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Big bird fan, I've got them all / played through them all on the iPhone / iPad / Kindle and Acer tablet.<br /><br />This 4th iteration is by far the cleverest iteration in the series.  The utilization of gravity as a mechanic in the birds flight / attack adds a new dimension to the game play.<br /><br />The only downside I've encounter, if you want to call it that, is that this app isn't as playable on the small screen (iPhone / Androids).  The HD is absolutely stunning though on the iPad.  Kindle shines too, just a bit smaller though.

B0052VI2V6|5.0|This is one of those SACD's that's incredible, reference type discs.  I'm not a huge Eagles fan, but I like them.  I love the way this SACD sounds in surround sound.  5 stars, highly recommend!
0439023513|5.0|Disclaimer: This review is being written in assumption that the reader has read the first two books........<br /><br />  In this sequel to the sequel of \\"The Hunger Games\\", you can expect action, a lot of action, and romance, and war. After Katniss discovers that district thirteen actually exists, she tries to find a way to help them in anyway she can, although she is torn up about Peeta being captured by the capital along with her \\"friendemy\\" Johanna. Evantually she is asked to be the Mockingjay, the symbol of rebellion and hope for the districts as they face their battle against the capital and its deadly forces. Will she do it? Well, you'll have to tell me yourself. Add this plotline with threatning broadcasts, exploding arrows, and an underground city, and you've got yourself one amazing book!<br /><br />Written by Malik R.

0685054667|4.0|I am not much a reader when it comes to history, but this book was absolutely astonishing to me. This story about a teenage Jewish girl is so far the best book I have read  about history.Although the story is in a diary it isnt really as \\"girly\\" as you would think.When I read the book I noticed how she didint sound like she was hiding and that is something that I like about this book.Just as this book had parts that i liked it also has parts that are not as good. I am mainly talking about when it gets boring, but that is okay because it did not stop me from finishing the great book. I really like this book because it is closely related to our daily lives(everything except the holocaust part of the story).If you like books dealing with important parts of history this is a book for you.If history is not your type of thing do not turn it down if you have never read this great book. i have never read a book that is so closely related to my life that deals with history. I might be sort of spoiling it for you but not to much.

B000ILYYJE|1.0|First off - I am a huge fan of High Resolution sound (especially in 5.1 surround sound) and my favorite band ever is the Doors.  I bought this set for the DVD-Audio versions of every album and found out that the best surround sound option they offer is DTS 5.1 format.  When played in surround, the sound of the discs are super flat and hollow.  I can barely hear Jim's voice in the center channel.  Turning up the Center channel helped a little bit, but it was still unacceptable.  The clarity is bad.  When listening in surround, these are arguably the worst sounding high resolution discs I have ever heard.  The Doors deserve better.  The Doors fans deserve better.  I've been had...  and am extremely bummed out.<br /><br />The stereo option does sound like a regular redbook cd.
1423113454|5.0|Do you enjoy mythology or adventure books or both? If you do you should read The Red Pyramid. It was written by Rick Riordan who also wrote the Percy Jackson series based on modern version of Greek Mythology. The Red Pramid is based on Egyptian Mythology. It involves 2 kids named Carter and Sadie Kane. One growing up traveling all over the world and the other growing up around London. Both brother and sister meet back in London then their whole world changes. They lose their father to some unknown Egyptian god and find themselves on their own. They discover their Uncle Amos and that they're descendents of the Pharoahs of Ancient Egypt.<br /><br />They travel to America with their uncle to learn more of their past. They snoop around their uncle's house to learn more about the soceity of the magicians and how they are facing one of the most powerful gods of egypt Set. They discover trouble at their uncle's house and get help from the goddess of cats Bast. They travel with her as they get chased by many foes. Soon they find another goddess but of scorpions who is on the side of chaos, and Bast has to use her true form to defeat her. A new friend named Zia comes to help lead them to the their path to help the ancient society of magicians to train them for what will come ahead.<br /><br />when they came to the training place, they see ancient memories of the past Pharoahs and gods. Then discover they hold the gods Horus and Isis inside them. They find a book that would help them defeat Setr. They learned more about their mom who had died years ago. They searched for the god Thoth so they could read the book to defeat Set. They have to face the Set animal on their way to Memphis to find Thoth. They discover the truth about Bast and why she was in the Duat. Thoth tells them what the books says and now they have to find the feather of truth and find out Set's secret name to defeat him. They have to go through many tests together to get the feather of truth. After many otherbattles, they finally get to Set's Pyramid with their Uncle Amos who happened to be possessed by Set. This book contains many facts about Egyptian Mythology and keeps you on the edge of your seat until it's over. And if you're interested in adventure and want to learn what happens to Set and the Kane family well you'll have to read the book.<br /><br />Written by: Joey S
B007N5YIUS|5.0|angry birds space the best game right now on android. very addictive can't stop playing it. new bonus levels are great.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|This is pretty challenging but also poorly made. I like that there are practice levels where you can start the puzzle in different stages but that also takes the fun out of trying to 'beat' the game. I must say, I gave up on this one a lot faster than the one before this.(And I love puzzles!) I also don't like that the plastic casing is very cheap... you can bend it in without applying much pressure.Not a fun thing to keep in mind while you are trying to get the little ball around the obstacles. And it is extremely frustrating when the casing 'pops' and the ball falls of. If you want one of these don't buy this one but try one of the other two, I found those a lot more fun.

1423101499|5.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth, sequel to the Titan's Curse, is a fascinating story about the everlasting battle between the Titans and Gods. The story takes place around the son of Poseidon, Percy. With a dreary prophecy looming over his head, Percy tries to live a regular life while he is starting another school after being kicked out for destroying the last one while fighting monsters. Percy attempts to make a good impression while he meets a old friend.<br /><br />While attempting to reserve a spot in the school, Percy finds himself in danger while in civilians see him in the fire stricken band room with a sword in his hand. Percy flees and returns to camp Half Blood where another quest is waiting for him and his friends. Percy must fing the infamous Daedalus in the mysterious Labyrinth.<br /><br />This book is suspenseful and hilarious at some points. It comes along with some unforgettable moments and mysteries that are finally solved. My favorite part is when Percy and his friends go to one of Hephaestus' forges and fight creatures that they have never fought before. This book is a amazing book that would usually suit a teenager or maybe even a adult.<br /><br />Written by Darius H.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow! What a creative mind Suzanne Collins has! To have woven this story of a future world that has created a perpetual punishment as payback for a past uprising and revolt, is just too fantastical to believe. Yet, we have the Hunger Games-a systematic and gruesome duel to the death.<br /><br />Through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, we experience first hand the wonder, marvel, horror and desperation of tributes that represent each of the twelve districts of Panem (the country which has evolved from the ruins of America). While my five star rating reflects how much I was drawn into the story and the plot's ability to keep me engaged, I am ashamed to admit the depraved, and inhumane premise of the story could capture my attention so thoroughly while simultaneously repulsing me with its wickedness.<br /><br />But, enough about my internal conflict. The real story is found in the characters. The hopeless helplessness of their plights linger long after they're gone. The innocence and single-mindedness seem entirely appropriate given the circumstances. The blossoming romantic conflict adds a strand of tension that provides relief when your nerves are frayed by the deluge of gore and grit. Wishing for an outcome that we know is impossible keeps us on the emotional roller coaster that is the glue to this series.<br /><br />Because, of course, the story doesn't end when the competition finishes, we know that there will be more. While we know the victor, we don't know if the promised bright future is really as gleaming as the games producers promise. If you love fantasy and drama intertwined with the bravery and introspection of the young, the Hunger Games will certainly exceed your expectations!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I can't really describe how much I LOVE this show.  I look forward to watching new episodes of it more than any other show I watch (and I watch a lot).  It's just amazing...so intense, exciting, suspenseful.  The acting is great as is the writing.  Can't wait to re-watch Season 4 and see Season 5.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Just one word - WOW! I was blown away. From the first sentence I was hooked. I read this in a relatively short time as I couldn't wait to find out what happened.<br /><br />I actually didn't know about the round-up so it was fascinating for me to read about. This story was so sad and I really dislike the fact it's based on real events. But it was so engaging. It was raw, it was devestating and it was emotion packed! I loved how it was written from the point of view of 2 different people, at different time points. And I loved the way it came together.<br /><br />I definitely recommend Sarah's Key!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I've been a fan of this band for quite a while, their last album, Aim & Ignite is great, it's on constant rotation in my car stereo. This album isn't bad, but it wasn't as great as I was expecting. I enjoy fun. in the first place because of their ability to create simple, enjoyable songs with solid lyrics and great delivery which is clearly their talent. In this album, they decided to add autotune and random noises to half of the songs, which really opposes that simple sound many of their fans enjoyed, it feels over-produced. Track 11 has a siren-like sound that makes me check my rear-view mirror every single time.I'm hoping when I see them again live that they cut out the junk and just perform the songs, which is something they do very well.<br /><br />It's still a pretty good album, worth buying if you're a fan, I'm just hoping they return to their roots next time.
B0046F289G|3.0|Running wild and free seems to be the lifestyle that punky John Tyree chose for himself. He doesn't respect his timid, peculiar dad, or girls. After a harsh reality check, John decides to join the army in hopes of maturing and finding the right path for his life.<br />When John comes home on leave, he is a new man. His perspective on his dad and girls has changed, and he \\"unexpectedly\\" falls in love with a mountain-native girl that is on a mission trip near John's home at the beach. In only a few days, John and Savannah are so unrealistically in love that it's almost hard to believe. When Savannah tries to diagnose John's dad with Asperger's disease, their relationship falters, but that's not the only complication.<br />Going back and forth between the army and home seems to hinder their relationship, and when John's dad tragically has a heart-attack, John decides to spend most of his time with him. When he seems to be doing well, John goes back o the army where he experiences harsh winters that made time drag on slowly, and 9/11 occurs. Receiving a break-up letter from Savannah saying that she is in love with another man is the last straw and John hits a dull, depressing stage. To make matters worse, his dad suffers from a second heart-attack. John then realized that his dad was slowly, but surely dying.<br />After the death of his father, John gets a surprise visit from Lucy, his long-ago ex, and he knows then that he really needs to see Savannah. Predictably, she is doing well and has fulfilled her dreams, but her husband is fatally ill. When John finds out that they can't afford the best treatment, he made a decision that could ultimately save Savannah's husband's life. In his mind, John knows there is a chance that her husband might not survive, and if that was the case, he might actually have another chance with her.<br />In this predictable love story, it's easy to see what will happen next. Nothing caught me by surprise, and there were a few chapters that were really depressing. My overall description of this book is dull and sad.<br />Written by: Maggie S.

B000P12LWY|5.0|I became totally hooked to this series. I love the characters and how it can easily take you back to that time when things were probably very much like how it shows in the movies.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I first heard fun. when I was working at my college radio station, I played one track and was hooked. This is a great album, I've listened to it probably hundreds of times, it's great driving music and fun for any other time as well. I think what I like most is the purity of it, you hear the band and the vocals, nothing else, and it's just as great in person (I've seen them twice). The Gambler was the first song I heard and it's still my favorite, I actually plan on playing it at my wedding reception next year.<br /><br />It's one of those albums that you can't just play once, you'll be singing along to the whole disc in no time.
1423140591|5.0|The Heroes of Olympus: The Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan is a sequel to The Lost Hero. It picks up similar to it's predecessor, with a hero without memory stumbling into a magical camp. The book differs from the first in good ways, however. The first, except for the cameos of old characters and tie-ins to this book, felt like a completely different story. The Son of Neptune still feels distant from the original five, introducing so many new characters, but it stays true to it's main character, Percy. The book recognizes that several readers have been with him for 5 installments, patiently waiting for him to return from The Lost Hero. It opens up strong reminding everyone just how powerful the demigod that took down Kronos was, elevating a whole river. The book keeps good pace and manages to introduce a whole new established camp-worth of characters in one book. It keeps the excitement and axiety of The Lost Hero with its cameos of older characters. That is the one issue with the book. It seems very, very similar to the first book in the series. The storylines are very interchangeable as well, aside from the few references to the prequel in this book, you could read either in any order. Even small details of the structure of both books reflect each other. The good thing is that both explain a good story in good pace. Fortunately, this booked upped the ante in every way. Larger battles, deeper mystery, and a cliffhanger patient fans will bite their nails on, this story drives on suspense, waiting longingly for the third installment. Written by Josh B.
B00000K3D4|5.0|\\"You have no power over me!\\" Well, this movie has power over me. This classic movie is a must see! I'll admit Sarah's constant \\"It isn't fair\\" gets pretty annoying but that's part of the charm. All is easily overcome by David Bowie simply appearing on camera. The music is amazing. So is the story and creativity.<br /><br />If by some miracle you haven't seen this movie, buy it now. You'll love it!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|woke up at four p.m. waiting for the game looked and looked for this app finally i found it and downloaded it so far I'm on cold cuts but the game is worth three dollars but if was five dollars I would still buy its that. good of a game I would recommend it to everyone who loves angry birds.
1466401885|5.0|Holy hotness! This college romance story has all of the grit, passion, sadness, glory, suffering, longing, and hope that I was searching for as a reader. How can you go wrong? This was my first Kindle book and I'm hooked now. I read this in 2 nights and they were really late nights since I couldn't put it down. The character development was spot on. It brought me back to my college days and memories of friendships and first loves.<br /><br />Buy IT!<br /><br />A few typos here and there but nevertheless there is no need to skim since each word really adds to the development. Enjoy.

B0055Q5F36|5.0|I like it. Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 slipped right in nice and cozy with a grin :D I didn't use the screen protector just yet, I'm sure it'll be nice too.<br /><br />Doesn't add too much bulk, I think it would feel weird if it were any bigger for one hand operation. But this fits quite nicely, and I already dropped it from my chair onto hard floor, still good and well protected. A little slippery, but the side buttons help with the gripping.I wish the camera lens were protected somehow, it's exposed but it should be alright.<br /><br />The side button covering is a little stiff, push a bit harder.. but it's still new. No big deal. JUST GET IT!!!

B003EYVXV4|5.0|\\"Hunger Games\\" is certainly the best film I have seen since many many months, and it is a very successful adaptation of an excellent book.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, both the book and the film are much deeper and much more ambitious, than what most critics and reviewers would make us believe. After reading the reviews in \\"New York Times\\", \\"Le Monde\\" and on \\"Msn.com\\" (to cite only few) I was surprised that they mostly missed everything that is important in this film. With a kind of amused superiority, which people from Capitol in this movie would immediately recognize, the \\"professional\\" reviewers pointed at the obvious allusions to gladiator fights, the reality shows, the importance of trashy entertainment in today's TV, the search for a new franchise able to replace \\"Twilight\\", etc., etc.<br /><br />But they almost entirely failed to see, that this film is first and above all about much more important things: how to keep hope, not lose the courage and preserve humanity and dignity under a totalitarian oppressive regime.<br /><br />I believe that almost everybody now knows that when writing \\"Hunger Games\\" Susan Collins attempted basically a modern (even futurist) retelling of the old Greek myth of Theseus and Minotaur. According to this ancient tale, after losing a war, every year the city of Athens had to send a tribute of seven young men and seven maidens to the king of Crete. Once there the young people were locked in the Labyrinth, to be devoured by the monster Minotaur. This yearly punishment and humiliation lasted until Theseus, crown prince of Athens, volunteered to be one of the tributes and once locked in the Labyrinth he defeated and killed the Minotaur.<br /><br />In \\"Hunger Games\\" what was once United States (and I think also Canada) is now called the Panem. It is a country divided in twelve Districts remaining under the control of the Capitol central metropolis. There was once thirteen Districts, but when they rebelled against the central power, the Capitol destroyed completely the District 13 with all its population and then defeated and submitted again the twelve others. In order to remind to its subjects how absolute is its power, the Capitol claims a yearly tribute - one girl and one boy of ages from 12 to 18 from every District. The tributes are then send to an arena and forced to fight, until only one remain alive. This yearly event is called the Hunger Games and it is shown live on TV to all the population of Panem. This film tells the story of what happened at the 74th edition of Hunger Games...<br /><br />For Capitol the purpose of Hunger Games is to remind yearly how powerful is the central metropolis and how dire can be the consequences of its wrath, but also - and even more importantly in my opinion - to humiliate and degrade the people of the Districts by forcing them to become accomplices (even if under duress) of a barbarian custom in which some of their own children are send to the slaughterhouse. And as all bullies and abusers know, it is much easier to oppress, abuse and brutalize victims who lack self-esteem...<br /><br />Well, in this film we can see how one of the tributes from District 12, an exceptionnal young girl named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), manages to turn the tables on the Capitol and by allowing people of Panem to regain some of their dignity she will be the pebble which starts the avalanche. The exact way in which she does that will not be revealed here, but both in the book as in the film it is described in a very intelligent and very moving way...<br /><br />This may seem a rather improbable thing that a 16 years old child can do something that will ultimately bring down a seemingly invincible and all-powerful tyranny, but let's not forget that in the real world, the great wave of revolutions of Arab Spring began on 18 December 2010 with a desperate gesture of a dirt-poor 27-years old Tunisian street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, who set himself on fire after having been robbed and beaten by the corrupt local police one time too much... Less than two years after, the opressive regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya already collapsed, the seemingly invulnerable dictator of Yemen had to resign and the Syrian brutal regime is facing a massive armed rebellion..<br /><br />Bottom line, this film is first and before all a story about how even a seemingly powerless person can horribly hurt a tyrannic regime with a magic potion made of lots of courage, an ice-cold determination, a great personal dignity, a little compassion, a handful of flowers, a couple of tears and one defiant and powerful gesture...<br /><br />The powerful message and excellent scenario are not the only reasons why I consider \\"Hunger Games\\" as a masterpiece. Actors were selected very carefully and they perform well. Jennifer Lawrence is simply perfect - there is no other word to describe her performance! However, after seeing her in \\"Winter's Bone\\" and \\"X-Men: First class\\" I didn't expect anything less.<br /><br />But the real surprise in this film comes from Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta Mellark, the boy tribute from District 12. His character is more difficult to play, because Peeta is in the same time more limited but also more complicated than Katniss. Josh Hutcherson could have very easily fall in one of the many traps which are build in Peeta's character. By overacting or underacting he could have make him a wimp or a passive follower or an immature kid, but he avoided those snares with grace and his Peeta comes out of this film as a surprisingly complexe and also a very likeable character. He is certainly not a hero and a fighter like Katniss - but until the very end he preserves his honor, in a deadly place where he shouldn't ever be send...<br /><br />A special mention goes to little Amandla Stenberg, who plays 12-years old Rue, the youngest of all the tributes. Her character is both secondary and in the same time incredibly important - and this little cute pixie played it perfectly!<br /><br />Other, more known actors contribute to the success of this film. Woody Harrelson is excellent as Haymitch, the only person from District 12 who ever won in the Hunger Games and is now an advisor to Katniss and Peeta. Lenny Kravitz portrayed a perfect Cinna, the man in charge of image of tributes from District 12 in public appearances before the games begin. And finally there is the giant figure of Donald Sutherland, who plays the supreme ruler of Panem, President Coriolanus Snow. He is purely incredible. There is a moment in this film when he says to somebody \\"I like you\\" - and I believe that I have never heard such a terrible and deadly threat in one short sentence since the archifamous Schwarzenegger's \\"I will be back\\"...<br /><br />I also absolutely adored the using of the cameras. In some moments of this film we have the impression of going after the characters with a camera, like a war correspondent following the fighters (this style was also very skillfully used in \\"The Shield\\" series). Of course not all the film is turned in this way, but mixing this kind of scenes with more conventional ones gives here an excellent effect.<br /><br />The games themselves are very skillfully described and are a very dramatic tale, full of surprises and twists. I found them much much better than \\"Battle Royale\\", to which this book and film are often compared. The games are deadly and brutal, but there is only limited gore - I think this film is suitable for young teenagers, although not for children younger than 12. There is also absolutely no nudity, sex or strong language and I for one found it a most excellent thing.<br /><br />There are still many more good things to say about this film, but I believe you should discover them by yourself. One more thing however about the book - it is of course possible to see and greatly enjoy this film without reading the book, but I believe that reading the novel first is a good idea. If reading thewhole book is out of question, I would advise to read at least the first hundred pages. It will not reveal much about the games themselves, but it will allow for a better understanding of some of the key elements: the strength of the bond between Katniss and her younger sister, the history that Katniss shares with her hunting partner Gale, the complicated relation between Katniss and her mother and last but not least, the mysterious bond existing between Katniss and Peeta Mellark.<br /><br />About this last point: if you did not yet read the book I do not want to spoil the pleasure of discovery so I will say just this - Katniss and Peeta lived for 16 years in the same village, but they never spoke one to another (except for an occasional \\"Hello\\") and they never touched one another in any way. And still, they share a secret as big as life and death, a secret which both bonded them together and in the same time separated them deeply... If you want to know the solution of this riddle you have either to watch very very carefully every scene of the film or simply read the book...<br /><br />Conclusion: this film is a masterpiece! I loved it and I am going to buy the DVD as soon as it is available. And I am SOOO going to see the the second part, as soon as it opens!pixie played it perfectly!<br /><br />Other, more known actors contribute to the success of this film.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I read an article earlier this week that said the creators of Angry Birds hope to rival Disney and plan on opening an Angry Birds Theme Park -- as skeptical as I was, if Angry Birds Space is the kind of creativity that is going to keep coming from Rovio, I have no doubt in my mind they will reach their goal.<br /><br />Right off the bat, the graphics are bright, vibrant and capture the essence of space so well -- the beaming asteroids, the distant planets and galaxies, the undeniable feeling of being alone.  The music pulled me right in as well, featuring futuristic sounds and soft, eerie music that set the tone for the rest of the game.<br /><br />There are three worlds currently: Pig Bang (30 Levels), Cold Cuts (15 Levels) and Eggsteroid (15 levels).  You may ask, what is so unique about this game from the others? Quite a bit actually.  You now operate with gravitational orbs that spin the angry bird around in an orbit.  Angling the bird to orbit in a certain path to destroy the pigs is the trick.  As you progress, multiple gravitational orbs connect in sort of a chain Venn Diagram.  Additionally, there are certain levels where the player must launch the bird OUT of the gravitational orb (into space where the orbit no longer affects the bird and it rises due to no gravity) and back in (granted, I have only played the first world and cannot comment on the others). These new elements bring a game that does not feel like fancy update to a franchise already with a large fanbase, but rather feels like an actual sequel, a worthy successor to Rio.  If this is the type of creativity still present within the minds over at Rovio, I'd venture to say that Angry Birds is in it for the long haul.

B004LWZW7O|5.0|When I purchased this film i expected an action packed evening of entertainment starring the multi-talented icon Justin Timberlake (or JT as he likes to be called), but what i got instead was a night of magic.  However, it didnt quite start out that way. In the middle of the opening credits the screen went black, i pulled myself off of the couch and dragged my body to the tv ( i dont have any feet in case you are wondering why i didnt just walk). I thought that maybe i had gotten some chocolate M&M residue on the dvd when i put it in causing it to malfunction (i love candy, especially M&Ms and had just finished my third bag). At the very moment i was about to press eject i heard a tapping on the screen of my Westinghouse...it was JT. \\"How about some M&Ms for me, brah?\\" he said. \\"I'm a-a-ah all out.\\" i stammered. I was in shock, this CLEARLY wasnt part of the movie. At first i thought i p'd him off, he made a mean face as he rubbed his belly like he was starving and had really needed a choch-fix, but then he did a little spin move and said smiling, \\"No biggie smalls..I'm not hungry anyways, I just had a smoothie. Hey, wanna dance?\\"  \\"Sure\\", i said \\"but, i aint gots no feets, my man!\\" (in my old timey black voice). \\"Let me worry about that, my friend.\\", he retorted as he reached thru my tv, took me in his airbrushed arms and pulled me into what i can only assume was Heaven or Magic Land. Almost instantly my stubs were replaced with a pair of sparkling dancing shoes that sparkled like sparklers. We shook what are mammas gave us for nearly an hour, took a break (watched Alpha Dog, which was too awful for words..poor Johnnny Staccato, i hope dead people can't see the films of their kids) and then danced some more. Eventually, the night had to end. My sparkle shoes wouldnt last forever, JT had to get back  doing his \\"thang\\" and to be honest after sitting thru Alpha Dog i really wanted to go home and watch Killing of a Chinese Bookie again..was i wrong in thinking John was a talented filmaker? How can an apple fall so far? Well, to wrap it up JT put me back into my living room, then from the otherside of Magic Land he reached into his pocket, pulled out my secret stash bag of M&Ms and waved um in my face as the screen went black. Yup, i DID have another bag and JT zoinked um, but guess what? Joke is on him..those werent the treats he expected. They were demon hellspawn eggs, ya dont go to the bowels of Hell, loose your feet and comeback with nothing do you? Do you, JT? Do you?a talented filmaker? How can an apple fall so far? Well, to wrap it up JT put me back into my living room, then from the otherside of Magic Land he reached into his pocket, pulled out my secret stash bag of M&Ms and waved um in my face as the screen went black. Yup, i DID have another bag and JT zoinked um, but guess what? Joke is on him..those werent the treats he expected.

B0016OMFPW|3.0|No denial that this is a very pretty sounding effort from Roy, with some well-crafted tracks among the exceptionally clean mix.  One thing I appreciate about his approach these days is surrounding himself with young energetic players to keep him engaged (these guys are tight), and his impeccable playing never disappoints.  I would really like to hear this working unit live.  But as a reviewer correctly stated, Earfood is best suited as ambiance for preparing a nice dinner.  If Roy's intention was to make his music a bit more accessible (as he has stated), then it succeeds comfortably on that level.  But it lacks a certain edge and I find myself revisiting 'Tenors of Our Time' and 'Parker's Mood' more often these days.

B0072X2O66|1.0|Mike Portnoy is obsessed with being metal, yet he absolutely sucks at it. I just don't understand it. He tried to ruin Dream Theater for years with his lame, cheese metal angle and now he has a brand new band to make a fool of himself with. Adrenaline mob's debut album is fake, lame and cheesy. I tried to give it a chance, I have to call a spade a spade. This album, as well as Mike Portnoy, the human being, is awful.
0140277447|5.0|I had known about Nanking before reading this book. I think many of the reviews here are either misconstrued or flat out spurious. Mrs. Chang never claimed to be the source for the Rape of Nanking. Many times, she clearly states that the facts may not be true. At that time and even today, it's difficult to absolutely verify everything. I only know about the invasion through the Internet, which reflects the sad state of the education here. That's the worst part about all of this: the coverup, from all sides. I really wish that there were more interests in events like this.<br /><br />My family is from China so I do have a certain bias. If you ask any Chinese that lived through this, they will tell you of the atrocious Japanese; it did happen and it is as bad as everyone claims it to be. For me, the foreboding message is that anyone of us is capable of doing things like this. It's easy to blame the Japanese for what had happened, especially if you're Chinese, but as history shows, this will happen over and over again. It's easy to turn on the news, watch a killer go on a rampage, and then claim that I would never do something like that. Put me in their situation, living life as they did, I'm pretty sure that you could.<br /><br />Mrs. Chang valiantly tries to leave this message with the readers. We need more people like this. She grew so passionate over her work and it affected her so much that it contributed and eventually led to her suicide. I strongly recommend this book to everyone. It's definitely worth the time and effort. It transports you to another part of life and history outside the comfortable that many of us live in everyday, and it's a book that will change you. The facts are not pleasant to read or picture, but neither was Schindler's List.

It takes me to a place within my heart that touched my inner soul, and opened it up to engulf the joys and sorrows that we all must go through.  At the same time, nourishing my spirit with the jewels of the earth and quenching my desires for expression of the beauty of our own being.  I feel so at peace -- the serenity that it brings. It freshens and purifies the very air that we breathe.  This transcends TIME.
0439023513|2.0|Book 3 was a huge disappointment and I believe some fans are giving Collins far too much credit for intentionality in its effect...unless she was writing from a hospital bed after a severe concussion which caused her to permanently forget who her characters were. Add a morphine (morphling?) drip and I'd say she pulled off some great writing, given her disabled condition. Absent that however, it just feels like she abandoned us and let an intern in her creative writing class finish the story...after he/she was off their anti-depressant meds for a couple weeks.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />If she was going for a Lord of the Rings, \\"Frodo can't go back to the Shire\\" moment, at least take a second to make her loss of innocence meaningful. In the first two books, Katniss is the girl on fire, but in this third book it is the reader. As each character we actually care about in the book is consumed, we agonizingly feel the flames burn to first, then second degree...but finally it reaches the third degree and we no longer feel at all. The one person Katniss is sure she loves from the beginning of the series is Prim, so with her nonchalant death the last nerve is singed. Unnecessarily, the story ends without life - just a bland existence. Was it too much to ask for the girl on fire to be a Phoenix and rise from the ashes - just as Finnick did who suffered 100x more abuse and still retained the capacity for hope and love? (BTW, Finnick's character development/redemption was the reason I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1, but snuffing him out like an afterthought borders on self-destructive behavior for a writer of Collins' caliber.)<br /><br />At the end of the day, the real reason we are so disappointed is that we know she is capable of so much more and this book almost read like Collins was lashing out at her own \\"Capital\\" by destroying what she had so artfully built in the first two books. In the end though, the Capital is intact, and only the innocent reader suffers...and by the end there is nothing but ashes.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this is an interesting 'game,' however the instructions are vague to say the least and at some point in creating all the things it suddenly started shutting down every time we tried a new combination.  no time for games that don't work! stop wasting our time.
B007MJSXEC|4.0|for the first time on this show i found myself rewinding a number again and again to rewatch.  it was that good.  it was not sung by either marilyn.  this was joe dimaggio's song about the end of his marriage.  it was a real show stopper. this should be happening more often than it is.  for all the technical greatness the two marilyns have, i have yet to desire an album by either of them.<br /><br />coming in as a close second was bernadette peters reprising ethel merman's performance of ROSES in GYPSY.<br /><br />that neither marilyn is knocking me out with star charisma fits in with the storyline as the people in charge hear from investors that they want someone else in the role, preferably a well known actress like scarlett johanssen.<br /><br />this show is still finding its footing but it is very promising.  angelica huston remains my favorite character.

B0012F9VS4|4.0|So overall, I like this and the 'New Baby' one by Mercer Mayer. They both are positive, and playful, but no book I've found is necessarily 'complete' in depicting/preparing BB for NB's arrival. They're just both good starting points from which I can add things that are more relevant to our family/situation.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+I like that it starts from NB's arrival at home. Doesn't include anything about pregnancy.<br />+It's rather realistic in it's portrayal of the NB: not able to eat 'food,' not able to walk, talk. It stinks when it poops, etc.<br />+It mentions that baby's cry to tell us things, since they can't talk.<br />+It reminds BB that he was once a baby and did all the things that NB is doing.<br />+It makes being a BB a REALLY positive thing, and that NB is at the disadvantage since NB can't have pizza, nor walk, talk, etc!<br />+Honors the individuality and special-ness of the BB, despite the NB's arrival.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It's NOT helpful to our family to set up an expectation that the BB can help feed NB a bottle - this just isn't gonna happen.<br /><br />-Stragne that it doesn't show the mom caring for the baby AT ALL. Although it's great to promote dads caring for babies, it's not realistic to portray moms having NO involvement at all in caring for NB.
B00008AWOD|5.0|This is the transition album for Placebo.  The beginning albums were guitar and lyric heavy.  Brian hadn't found his style yet.  In sleeping with ghosts, placebo really got into the sound they wanted to have.  It has great bass usage with dynamic drumming.  The guitar work is polished and compliments the singing octave perfectly.  This cd they were all playing some of their best material.  This cd with a loud sound system sounds superb, you can't help but move with the tempo.
B0034G4P1W|4.0|The book is great. The movie is great. That doesn't usually happen. I guess it is because Gideon Defoe, the author of the book, also wrote the screenplay for the movie, intending one not to be a \\"spoiler\\" for the other. The movie was definitely more of a kids' movie, where the pirates were the ragtag underdogs struggling to keep up in the increasingly competitive pirate world (you are judged for your \\"booty\\"--double entendre?). The book has different characters and a completely different villain! That is how much the stories differed. The book also contains more grown-up humour - more people being run-through by swords, more blood, more walking the plank, more steely pirate bad-assedness. Queen Victoria is one crazy woman in this movie, enough to get PETA up-in-arms for ages. The other pirates the Pirate Captain competes against for the Pirate of the Year Award (Salma Hayek, Jeremy Piven) are swashbuckling good fun, even if they are more than a little rude toward the beloved Hugh Grant's character. Also, Hugh Grant gives a surprisingly different performance than the one he's known for in his rom-coms; his pitch is deep and fierce and his performance is touchingly funny without any over-saturated fluff. Gideon Defoe is spot on for creating a movie that is appropriate for the kiddies and a book that has humour for the older kids. See the movie because Aardman's stuff is always funny, but definitely read the book to get the original story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really liked this book. The concept is scary but when you start reading it, it's a very good read. I was reading like crazy to finish them. They are very addictive!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I am a huge fan of splash top it allowed me to connect from any of my devices to my desktop!  A++++
B004SBS8LA|5.0|FINALLY!!!! A company NOT just  riding the coat tails of their first game... OUTSTANDING Game Boys &amp; Girls!!! 5 Stars!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I bought this for my two boys ages 5 and 7 for their kindle fires.  they love it.  spending hours on it with my help though. I have fun helping them and best dollar used on vacation!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was amazing!  I would absolutely recommend the entire series. The first I saw as a movie instead, but the following two books were solid good reads.  I loved the character development and found Lisbeth, among many others, to be a fascinating character.  100% recommend!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a grate game. I thenck ddxccccdfygcxxddffc fffff gfffff ffff ggggg gffff fffff ccfff ggggg ggggg deed gghh gggg cgg ghj hfgj giff gggg feed
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Amazon you know what we like. This Movie was more than I expected ! It kept me on the side of the ape. First I felt really bad for the little guy, because they treated him like he was nothing, then the little guy grew up, and all hell broke lose. It was like I was right there, but actually I was on the edge of my seat yelling get those rotten creeps, give them what they gave you and the others. LOL I really got into the movie. Makes me glad I'm a decent person.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|don't waste one more minute of your boring life.....get this app now! cant go for more than an hour without checking on the status of the dishes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Ive had this app since 2008, my blackberry days. When I got my iphone and Kindle this app was still there. I love the. Notes factor of this app. I would recommend this app to any and everybody either Christian or non-Christian. It is a great learning tool as well as study tool.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an entertaining and thought provoking story!!!! I really enjoyed it. Hope there is more to come. I was actually surprised at the depth with which this \\"new\\" author was able to capture and convey.
1400069289|5.0|And this book is proof of that. Sometimes it's just a matter of having the right perspective. This book shows you how habits are formed and how they perpetuate themselves in your life. One you understand how you feed into that cycle, you have incredible power of your habits and they are much easier to break. I think the research behind this book is outstanding and it's an interesting read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great. possibly violent at times. my favorite parts were when katniss cut the tracker-jacker nest off the tree and when  katmiss ate the berries to save peeta
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Sure it's fluff, but SO much fun to watch!  Love the dancing & music so much I bought the soundtrack as well. Also, the extras that come with the BluRay are fun too.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|After  the upate i no longer get any force closes on my kindle fire. Great game, good job on the fast update.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This is basically the same K-Tel type thing that has been for sale for 40 years. And I guess the reason it has been around that long is because it works, though there is a learning curve and you can't expect to get 100 percent success rate. I would put it together and then throw away the instructions because there is a better way.<br /><br />Best Practices:<br />- score once, not once and a half, not once and a quarter...as close to exactly once as possible. You are not trying to cut through the bottle, just create a fracture point. If you go around more than once you will likely increase the chances of spider cracks where you don't want them.<br />- pour boiling water around the score and then run cold water on it. Repeat as needed. Forget that tapper thing, the bottle will just fall apart if you do the hot and cold right.<br />- Thicker is better. I've had my best success with bigger thicker wine bottles; probably 80 percent. Most beer bottles are too thin and brittle so I barely have a 50 percent success rate.<br /><br />I wish they had charged a little more and made this a little more beefy; the little wing nuts that have to tightened and loosened often are really flimsy; like you could bend them with your fingers without being a gorilla.<br /><br />This was an entry level device for me. I eventually want to build a glass bottle wall and will likely get a tile wet-saw so I can do a couple hundred. If your recycling center is like mine, they will gladly let you take all the bottles you want.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|$2.99 is nothing to pay for this game! Played it on my Android and had to have it on my Kindle Fire. LOVE IT!
B001DHXT1G|5.0|I absolutely love this incarnation of the HULK in the movie universe, and can not wait to see more of him in the new AVENGERS movie due out soon!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|loving this game. just when you thought angry birds was getting boring, they come out with an space. loving it, and hooked again. thanks rovio.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas because she spends alot of time reading.  She loves it.  The display is easy to see and the user interface is easy to get used to.  My daughter and son love it because it has wifi capability and the speed is pretty good.  The browser could use a little upgrading but for the cost it is well worth it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this entire trilogy!  As middle books go, it does serve its purpose of briding those who got hooked in The Hunger Games to finding out the Katniss's decision between Peeta and Gale, and brings action as did the first book, but it just doesn't measure up to book 1.
0439023483|1.0|Have you ever asked yourself the question, \\"Wouldn't the world be better if, in `the future', the government took young boys and girls away from their parents and forced them to kill each other in an Arena on live television for the amusement of the masses?\\"... Details below.    [...]
B007N5YIUS|5.0|its great and fun!! thanks for the  cool graphics and faster games. much easier in this space version. i love it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some games are a little challenging but they are also fun. have to earn points in order to open new games
B004PAHZMC|3.0|The pictures mislead one into thinking this is a good sized storage unit, when it's much smaller than expected.  I'm sure someone could quip that the measurements are listed, which if they are, I overlooked.  I just expected something larger to store my sons many, many StarWars lego pieces.  However, functionally, it serves its purpose and adds to imaginative play.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Another outstanding piece of work by the Kendrick Brothers. I really enjoyed the way it was shot.  May have been a little long, but when the film gets on track, it stays on track.  Interesting ending as well.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|this case is just what I wanted, keeps the kindle safe and easy to transport in my purse. found that many of my friends liked it also.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|please I beg you to please make a free full version on all devices cause I love these games but my mom wont let me buy apps but I played a free download of this on Pc and loved it that's y it is five stars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!  The entire trilogy actually.  Action, adventure, and clean enough to share with my kids.
0439023483|1.0|Battle Royale + The Running Man.<br />There are so many stories about a bunch of people being put onto an island and a televised fight to the death, yawn.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The premise of this YA novel x 3 is fascinating.  Thoroughly enjoyed the first of the books and had to know what happened next.  First novel shocking, 2nd and 3rd less so.  Read on Kindle from Amazon
B004T2QZL8|5.0|fun. had no trouble playing on kindle fire. looked up some cheats online but beat the three mini games on my own. would be nice if you didn't have to reopen both sets of items to match them each time. like leave first opened up...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As I've mentioned in my reviews of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I absolutely love this series.  However, I felt as though the journey in this final book was drug out and certain specific relationships were not given as much attention as was necessary (trying to avoid any spoilers here).  Regardless, the series is a great read, much more substantial and fulfilling than the Twilight series (as it's been compared to).
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Worth the $2.99 for NO ads. very clear on both my kindle fires. very addictive game. love the gravity.<br />just but it. you wont regret it
6301752686|5.0|THIS VHS TAPE IS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.NOW FOR THE MOVIES,THERE ARE VERY SHORT STORIES; 1-\\"PLUTO'S JUDGEMENT DAY- PLUTO HAS A NIGHTMARE,WHERE HE IS BEING SENTENCE FROM A COURT OF CATS,ON ALL THE BAD THINGS HE HAS DONE TO CATS. 2- \\"LONESOME GHOSTS\\"- MICKEY,GOOFY & DONALD ARE GHOST BUSTERS,WHO ARE TRYING TO CLEAR A HOUSE OF GHOSTS. 3- \\"TRICK OR TREAT\\"-THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE- UNCLE DONALD GIVES HIS NEPHEWS A REALLY BAD TIME ON HALLOWEEN,SO THE NEPHEWS GET HELP FROM A REAL BROOM CARRYING WITCH.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I fist seen and got this game as a free daily offering AmazonApp. I have always loved playing mahjong so I thought I'd give it a try on my Nook Color. I love it, it's entertaining.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|So, this is normally a free app on android, just like the other angry birds games, even the ones on kindle fire. but amazon and rovio just couldn't resist a cash grab huh? I will be copying the apk off my phone to sideload it on my kindle. low move guys.
B006YMM64G|5.0|It was the best christian movie I have seen in a long time. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is down to earth about everyday life.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I was waiting for the free version all damn night only to find out this morning there wasn't one yet.  So i downloaded the game from the android marketplace on my phone took the file off my phone and side loaded it on my kindle fire working like a charm just can't stand that blurry icon but i guess its the price I pay until they decide to release the free version in the amazon app store.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|\\"Take Off Your Shoes\\", \\"Queen of Denmark\\", \\"Reason with Me\\", \\"Old Lady\\" are all very very good.  But I really just wanted to leave a rating not a review (Amazon requires 20 words min).
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I want this game so badly why can't they make a free one this game looks awesome and I really want to play it
B007MNV5WU|1.0|i waited so long just to wait more for free!!!!! seriously where is the free . all the others are free so why isn't this one!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|when I bought it online it told me to download and install it at the appstore. the one that was online was free this wasnt
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Utterly Disappointing. That's What I Have To Say About This Book. I Was So Very Tempted To Read It When Everyone At My School Was Telling Me, Because I Love To Read A Good Book, That I Should Read This. So I Agreed And Borrowed It From Amazon For my Kindle Fire. I Read To Halfway On The First Day, Then Abruptly Stopped. The Whole Time I Had The Book Borrowed, Went To Waste. I Never Re-Opened The Book. I Expected Action and Adrenalin Rush, As People Say You Get As You Read The Book, Excitement, And Never Wanting To Put The Book Down. Boy, Was I Wrong. All I Got Out Of The Book Was Boring, Nearly Falling Asleep, Yawning, And Put The Book Down Almost Immediately After Realizing What A Waste It Was On My Kindle. I Still Say To This Day, \\"Thank God That I Never Bought The Book, And Just Borrowed.\\" I Don't Know What I Would Do If I WASTED $5.00 On A Book That Doesn't Even Deserve All The Praise It Is Getting.
086571701X|5.0|Great book easy to pick-up and put down yet carry on with the thought process uninterupted. Chapter conclusions at the end of each chapter were extrreamly important to drive home the main points of the chapter just read. Illistrations and photos were also very good. Book was barrowed at the libary, but will buy one now for constant reference.  Well done............ 5 stars
B002L5KKK2|1.0|This movie is great, one of my favorites, the DVD on the other hand was horrible, the quality was even worse, when I inserted the DVD it started the movie right away (no menu options).... the ad said \\"NEW\\" but when I received it, it was a copy, the image on the DVD wasn't even centered right, the cover was off color, I returned it for a refund.... VERY DISSAPOINTED.....
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|if you want a pro version of an office suite, get this!<br />organization is easy and neat, excellent file access<br />read and edit RTF as well as full standard set...<br />it is worth the price... i tried many others, but this is it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This was my first CD purchased through Amazon. I am very pleased with it. The CD was in great shape and I really enjoy listening to it and have even shared it w/my neighboro. Thank you for such good service.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Once in a blue moon, a great record hit the light. This is it! I can't stop listening. Classic Van Halen. Eddie is playing better that ever and Wolfgang did his homework! GREAT CD!
B005HI7NP0|5.0|Every track is a winner. Simple catchy hooks and melodies that stay with you and make you shake your hips or pat your foot even when you don't want to. Betty's voice is in top form and most of all, her lyrics are constructive, progressive and  upbeat. My favorite-listen-to-it-every-day track is \\"You and Me, Leroy\\". This song alone is worth the price of the album. The up and comers could take a serious lesson from this album.<br /><br />Go'head wicha'self, Betty! You did a great thing.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|If you enjoy Mahjong you will enjoy this game, it has all of the things you would expect of it and it is put together quite well.  The controls are intuitive, accurate and well placed.  I would recommend this game to any and all who enjoy this style of game.
159448385X|5.0|I read \\"The Kite Runner\\" a few years ago and loved it. \\"Splendid Suns\\" was no less powerful and moving. With two very strong female leads, I find it hard to believe that a man actually wrote this book! Hosseini did a wonderful job conveying the complex emotions of Mariam and Laila as well as the relationship between them.<br /><br />The story starts out somewhat slowly, alternating between background on Mariam and then background on Laila. The two characters jus blend together into an amazing story! The heartbreak of both characters is unbearable. I would recommend this book to anyone! Loved it.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|It's a must see movie. The plot is very intense, therefore, makes it emotional. This just got added to  my favorites movies list.
0765350386|5.0|I loved this book, specially since I have lately read a few that were pure garbage. It is original, you can´t put it down. It is not as good as The Wheel of Time or A Song of Ice and Fire but it is a good read.
0439023513|2.0|OK. This whole series was amazing. I devoured the 1st book, loved the second despite what everyone else says about the second one, and then I got to the third one. I bought it the day it came out because i didnt want to wait for it to appear in my local library. I was on vacation on the beach with sunlight and sand awaiting me and I didnt care. Main objective= read Mockingjay.<br />So for 5 hrs straight I read this book till I was done. I finished the book, then stared at the wall for about minutes with a 0_0 look on my face. Th face and dissapointment can be contributed to so many things.<br /><br />1) Katniss's mother made me want to punch someone. She was just so selfless and uncaring I couldnt believe her.<br />2) All the pointless deaths on her journey to kill President Snow. She finally does something for herself in the book only to not actually kill President Snow!<br />3) the was PS dies. he dies laughing. Seriously? After you think up all these lizards cross breeds and giant clock arenas, you couldnt think of a better way to kill him????<br />4) Katniss is such a pawn throughout the whole book, I found it hard to read. If she was going along with it because of her emotional distress from the clock arena, which would have made some type of sense, that would been cool. But we don't get anything about that.<br />5) Peeta getting poisoned. It seems that since New Moon, every YA author needs to find a way for the male love interest to abandon the female. I thought Suzanne was better than that. I guess I was wrong.<br />6)the epilogue. First of all, it was like a page and a half to tie up the whole series. there was so little description I found myself wanting more. secondly, the way peeta gets better is \\"through time\\" I believe the exact words were : Peeta and I....grew back together. Apparently, we readers arent privileged to know why they were able to do that. Then Gale getting that job was just a plot device to get him out of the picture so that Katniss wouldnt have to chose. The love triangle that built up during the last two books is completely and totally forgotten it seems.<br />7) Prim dying. If a whole book series starts because of the characters love for someone, you don't kill off the character. Especially not near the end where we don't even get to see any emotional ramifications of such an event except that she gets drugged up for like the fourth time in the book!<br />8) the \\"commercials\\" in districts 8 and 2. Katniss is strung into doing it, and it doesnt really make much sense.<br />All in all, I wish i hadnt spent my 17.95 on this book. It was just a highly disappointing end to the series
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is a review of the 3D from the movie John Carter (of Mars) 3D.<br /><br />First, I enjoyed the 2 hour movie quite a bit and was warped into the world thanks to a like-able, well acted cast of characters and aliens, along with some great adventure as John Carter sets out to solve the mystery while choosing to sacrifice his freedom or not, regarding the princess, who needs his reluctant help.<br /><br />3D REVIEW of JOHN CARTER: Note: This is a 2D to 3D conversion with 3D CGI computer graphics. This suggests only the live action was converted.<br /><br />First, the parallax 3D (the layers of objects and the depth between them) is top notch here. The different characters really stand out strongly from foreground and background. If you value clearly separate layers of depth in your 3D movie, this one delivers throughout from beginning to end on an impressive level. The characters themselves also show good volume, so they are not flat cardboard cutouts. That's important.<br /><br />Next, the depth reaching into the screen, is also present. You can look far into the screen without any trouble.<br /><br />As far as pop out (objects moving outside the screen towards you), there are a few nice pop out moments here or there, but mostly, the film keeps things within the confines of the screen.<br /><br />3D Layers: 9/10<br />3D Depth: 8/10<br />3D Pop Out 5/10<br />3D OVERALL: 9/10 (not an average). This movie looks great in three dimensions.<br /><br />If you value 3D adventure movies, John Carter 3D is one to really consider adding to your collection. 2 hours of excellent 3D. Buy it.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|my six year old loves this game!  we have a lot of fun playing it together. can keep him entertained for a long time. addicting!
B005I4JG80|5.0|Enjoyable read. Sensible advice. Somewhere between the crazy tiger mom stuff and the over-indulged \\"saying no is bad for their self-esteem\\" school of thought. I've tried a few of the concepts in the book and will definitely employ more of them as needed. Her stories of an American mommy in Paris are funny and humbling!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was looking for a way to save my stories and thoughts. This works for that exactly. It organizes my notes by when I write it and I downloaded some pictures and put them on evernote, they look amazing. Thanks.
B0058VW36U|2.0|I'm rating cut the rope finally and giving it 2 stars due to the fact that there hasnt been an update in a long time, not to mention the fact they released a new game instead of even giving the other one a single new level. Boo.
0735619670|5.0|I purchased this book just before registering for classes in my first semester of a computer science major.  This book taught me more about how to write code, and how to think about code, than anything my teachers were saying.  Even though the book is large, there is not a single chapter in it that I'd drop out.  The book builds up from the concept of the line of code, to the function, to the object.  It also builds outwards into design and testing.  One of the lines that is repeated throughout the book is that a good programmer programs 'into' a language, and not 'in,' the language.  This means that it's more important to use what you know and think about how to tackle problems than it is to get caught in the trap of \\"What can I do in Java/C#/etc?\\"  Not only is the book itself valuable, but the bibliography and suggested readings for each chapter introduce books on nearly every coding topic, with helpful summaries of why you'd want to read each.  Simply put, this book is the foundation of a good programming library.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|so fun, I am a huge fan of memory games until force closes started! lots of reviews with the same issue. hope it gets fixed soon.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Probably no need to give a review because this book is out there selling itself. I was told by several friends to check out this series and boy am I glad I did. Very hard to put down. My kids loved it! We real all three in record time. Can't wait for the movie!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|just that, Awesome!<br />completely new, wonderful<br />a twist if u will. worth getting, get ad free when u can. keep rocking rovio
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this game is so super ultra mega fun i could be playing for hours nd there is a kid mode on it too
B005Q1W10A|2.0|Great show however this copy of the DVD is a little inferior.  It continually pauses and often causes the television to turn off!  Not sure that this is an official dvd!
B00001IVOR|5.0|This is the best Wutang CD from 1997. every member was at their best when it came to spittin bars! Best Ive ever heard.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love the raw energy behind that voice.  Initially downloaded just a couple of songs from i tunes and before I knew it, had the whole album.  Listen to it every day while walking the dog and the background beat in a lot of the songs keeps me a good pace.  Some of the lyrics and notes have almost a haunting quality.  The music sort of wraps itself around you and there's no way out:-)
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have been using the G920 for several months now and have found the headset to the best I have used. This wireless headset has exceeded my expectations for sound quality and battery life and they are very comfortable on my medium sized head after 3-4 hours of continuous use.<br /><br />After unboxing the headset, it took approximately 2 hours to charge the battery to 100%. I installed the software/drivers on my Win7 (64bit) gaming PC. This was a standard install with nothing out of the ordinary. These worked out of the box with Ubuntu and Mac OS X however you don't get the simulated surround sound due to the lack of software/drivers. None the less, you can still use them as a wireless headset.<br /><br />I have had no issues with battery life or sound quality. I have been impressed with the wireless range but I haven't tested it more than 30 feet or so. The only issue I have had is that the Logitech software crashes every once in a while. I typically just restart the executable and eventually it runs as intended. It may take 2-3 attempts though. This happens, at most, 10-15% of the time and has not been addressed with updates from Logitech.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this headset for any serious gamer out there. I was a wired headset user prior to the G930. I would say that it would pain me to go back.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire. Syncs with my google calendar smoothly.<br />I was using Pocket Informant but could not get it to sync with Google Calendar.<br />A lot of options to customize the look and function to your preference.<br />Can send event reminders to your phone via text message.<br />Also allows you to view without an Internet connection.<br />Fills a much needed void on the Kindle Fire.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I bought this for myself but havent watched it yet. I'm sure it is very good since all the others have been.
0545265355|5.0|Great price for a boxed set of the trilogy. It was brand new and in perfect condition.  I'm very happy with my purchase and glad to have used Amazon.
B0071MV540|2.0|This movie should have been good -- excellent cast and plot. But it's so full of details and so light on punchlines (especially compared to other Ben Stiller movies) that watching becomes unfulfilling. I paused the movie to go to the bathroom, and when I came back I started texting...three days later I realized that I didn't even watch the last 30 minutes of the movie. That's how uninteresting it is.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app does just what is says it will do. It gives you current weather conditions as well as extended forecast and even radar views. I use it everyday.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The acting was excellent all the way through. Emma Stone did an amazing job of playing a tom-boy, especially considering that she's so attractive in other movies. As a Southerner, I can assure you that the accents were very accurate.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|Wow, what great atmosphere in this movie! Ah, the seventies- the cold war, deadpan glances that reveal far more than estimated. Sinister motives in the simplest of gestures. A world contained in a single missed implication... A car starts. A starling bursts from the shrubbery... The leaden sky. I understood that there was a spy in this darned thing. A coupla people got killed. Violently. The guy at the start lasts to the end. Meanwhile, there's something about some country that has churches that look like mosques. Otherwise, fuggedaboutit. All I remember is the color brown. Lotsa lotsa brown in this one. And the lead guy learns to smile at the end. That's all you need to know.
B007BLCGNU|1.0|I was expecting a cross between The Aviator and The Good Shepherd -- a thrilling and epic portrayal of a great man hiding serious psychological issues, as he battles communism or racketeering behind closed doors using methods that often cross moral lines.<br /><br />Instead, it was a documentary about a man suppressing his homosexuality -- the FBI is just a backdrop for this romance, not a focus of the movie.<br /><br />Why would you take America's most controversial bureaucrat and focus on his possible homosexuality instead of his famous actions in office? There are way more interesting homosexual couples to build movies around.<br /><br />This movie is neither a good crime thriller like The Untouchables nor a good romance like Brokeback Mountain -- it's nothing and it will be forgotten.

B0076NKNLA|3.0|If you wish to portray the sexiest woman in modern history, shouldn't you at least be sexy?<br /><br />Michelle Williams just isn't sexy in this movie. This could have been a film about any over-stressed artist. The unapologetic sensuality of Marilyn Monroe is nowhere to be found.

B007FH9GT2|4.0|This movie brings up all sorts of emotions for victimized women, but it doesn't wallow in depression -- Lisbeth is strong and gets her revenge. I found it empowering.<br /><br />As the clues come together in this thrilling investigation, everything is building toward some awesome climax...but it never really materializes.<br /><br />Instead (spoiler alert!), the bad guy clumsily gets himself killed during a (very) brief car chase, it turns out that Anita is Harriet (I still don't know what happened to Anita), and Lisbeth completely destroys Mikael's Ponzi-scheming nemesis with practically no effort (she just hacks his computer, and he flees the country). The whole conclusion is too easy, the bad guys are too weak.<br /><br />Biggest frustration: when did Martin become a tech-savvy Bond villain with a gas chamber in his basement? And why didn't he use the gas on Lisbeth? He's standing next to the switch. This was a silly moment in an otherwise well-made movie.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Forget its foibles, in the grand scheme of things they are so ultimately forgivable!!! JC is a wonderful piece of sci-fi. I adored it even more the second time I saw it as it really gave me the chance to pick up on subtle nuances in motion capture acting, plot and backstory, as well as enjoying the scale of the set pieces and landscape ever more! In my opinion this film was fun, daring, exciting and heartfelt. JC has oodles of charm and I predict it will become a cult classic if not a commercial success

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have now read all three of these books. I had to skip by many a chapter just because it was the same thing over and over and over again. I suggest the author purchase a thesaurus and maybe learn a few more adjectives. For the price, these books are most certainly not worth it. It was poorly edited and just badly written.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|I have the 25th anniversary DVD and I thought that having to buy it again just to get a Blu-Ray was kind of a waste.  Not so! This combo package is totally worth it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has hands down been my favorite \\"new\\" (meaning a new read for me) book in recent memory.  It was engaging and interesting almost from the beginning and right up until the end.  This is the first book in years that I have found myself staying up to read because I can't put it down.  I read it in just a few days, and I can't wait for the next one. I cannot recommend this highly enough, especially with the movie coming out shortly.<br /><br />Katniss, the main character, was fantastic - just the right mix of strength and compassion etc. to make for a very compelling female character.  Too often authors think a strong female character has to be unfeeling, and Collins has nailed the in-between, for me at least.<br /><br />I thought this was an interesting commentary on society; both the potential that we will degenerate to the point where we will have roman style gladiatorial combat and the discrepancy between the rich and the poor, which is very much a central theme of the book.  It somewhat remind me of Lord of the Flies, although of course here the violence is not voluntary.<br /><br />While the book is very brutal, it didn't bother me, and I felt there was a constructive point to the violence.  Furthermore, there is a hopeful message buried under the violence - many of the tributes maintain their humanity despite what is happening to them, which I thought was great.  Likewise, while the toying with Peeta's heart tore at the reader's heartstrings, it does add another layer of brutality to the already brutal games.<br /><br />Of course, as always, there were some minor negatives to the book.  First, I felt the love story was unnecessary and overdone.  I didn't really feel that it added much to the book, other than maybe to give a focus for Katniss's confusion.  Even if one can see it's utility, I felt like it was too much of a focus for the latter portion of the book.  Likewise, I got the impression that Gale was meant to create a kind of love triangle, but if so his relationship with Katniss really should have been more developed - maybe it is in the other books?<br /><br />SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER:  More importantly, I really felt much of the end was predictable - however, that didn't take away from my desire to find out how it unfolds.  I just think the author would have made for more tension by having the story be in the third person or having multiple first person viewpoints.  First person automatically indicates, to me, that the person narrating must survive - I've only read one book where that was not the case.  Likewise, the love interest with Peeta somewhat gave away that he must survive - it would have had more shock value etc if she had killed one of them or at least led us to believe that one or both might die. Third, the book really felt like a one-off to me; yes she left a bit of a cliffhanger with the romance, but she could have wrapped that up with another chapter.  I am really curious to see what happens in the second book, as it doesn't feel at all natural to me to have a second book, much less a third.<br /><br />Overall a really excellent book, it held my attention the entire time and I could not wait to find out what happened at the end.  And I can't wait to read the follow up, either.his relationship with Katniss really should have been more developed - maybe it is in the other books?<br /><br />SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER:  More importantly, I really felt much of the end was predictable - however, that didn't take away from my desire to find out how it unfolds.

B004LWZW8I|3.0|I am well-versed with Greek mythology, but this movie's plot and direction was all over the place. I personally think Greek mythology (and Roman, Indian, and Norse, for that matter) is ripe for action movie-making, especially with today's brilliant special effects. But after seeing this movie, I remembered things like plots, direction, casting, dialogue, and production matter.<br /><br />It certainly looks pretty, I'll give it that--and it doesn't have that slightly false, kind of strange look that \\"300\\" had to it's backgrounds, for example. Shading, shadows, and coloring is used well during battle-scenes to make certain scenes particularly enjoyable. However, the sound is off--not sure why, but at times I had the sound turned up to 75, so I could hear dialogue,which was kinda sad because it only made sense about half the time, and then dropped it to 30 during the battles.<br /><br />However, I found the film deeply boring and predictable. I looked at the clock at least 15 times during the film on DVD, and I strongly suspect I might have gotten up and left if it was in the theater. I'm not sure why it's so boring, exactly--for one, there is no reason to care for any of the characters, as they are shallowly drawn caricatures, at best, or simply faces with names, at worse--but there is also heavy use of slow-motion scenes and long, \\"zooming in\\" and \\"zooming out\\" shots of landscapes. Some scenes and transitions just took a LONG time! I strongly suspect this was a 60 minute film, extended to be become \\"production\\" length by cheesy use of slow motions, landscapes, and repeated shots of things that didn't matter (foggy walls, the metal bull, Olympus, etc). I'm frankly a little tired of the use slow-motion fight scenes in Hollywood, though I didn't even reallize it until watching this film. I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they mention all the fight scenes as if there are many--I think there is 1 or 2 in the first hour of the movie--and maybe 2 or 3, including the longer one at the end, in the last hour--and other than the final fight, I think they last 2 or 3 minutes at the most. Furthermore, and most damningly, they are essentially the same scenes one sees in the advertisements. There really isn't that much else, though they are longer.<br /><br />I personally found Henry Cavill decent in a poorly-written role (for example, why would the army at the end rally to his words, since he's not part of them and has done everything possible to avoid involvement in the conflict with the army who asked him to join them?), and Frieda Pinto (as always) gorgeous and watchable, but her character was essentially a trope with little true value in moving the plot forward, and who loses her powers of predestination after she is knocked up by the hero (wow, what does THAT say?). I did not like Mickey Rourke's character or characterization, as written or performed, and I'm generally a Rourke fan...too mindlessly evil and selfish, though not particularly intimidating, maybe a little too bizarre. Why does he, when the gods ignore his call for help, decide to kill the gods by releasing the titans, rather than concluding there are no gods (which is actually more rational)? Why does he want a magic bow, the Nuclear Weapon of the Greek World, that he then uses exactly twice?  Why would he conclude the gods, who beat the titans once, wouldn't do it again?  Why does he keep switching out from amongst a series of garish masks? Why does he struggle so with speaking full sentences without an East Coast accent?<br /><br />And finally...the battle between the titans and gods at the end. Kinda good, except it made no sense according to the mythology. So the titans are a bunch of frenetic, bestial, grey-skinned, normal-sized PEOPLE with no fighting skills and who basically explode when the gods swing sticks and pointy knives into them? The gods are essentially played like superheroes in this movie, but the titans (who are supposed to be immortal, powerful GIANTS against whom the gods rebelled--and barely survived! They were imprisoned because they were too powerful to kill and too dangerous to leave loose!) basically act like the mindless, swarming vampires in \\"Blade III.\\" C'mon, seriously?<br /><br />In the end, it might be decent popcorn fare for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon when it's raining or snowing too much outide, as long as you can rent it or get it for a discounted price.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Although this book wasn't the exact \\"Steven King\\" type of writing style, I thought it was a wonderful book.  I could feel as if I were in Dallas on that fateful day, and it also made me wonder \\"what would I do\\", if it were possible to change history.  Excellent.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Okay so I read this after reading the fifty shades trilogy so it wasnt as good as I was hopeing and that is probably because I did read it after and not before I probably would have loved it before. I LOVED travis though.. I mean how can you NOT... but the one thing that kind of kept me from fallin in love with it was that they were so young.. but there were times that I did forget about that..<br />but a possesive alpha male who is part of a fight club who has mommy issues.. who could go wrong?? lol
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I originally ignored this book on my Amazon (or was it Goodreads.com?) suggestions, but finally bought it because I'm in a bit of a book funk. I love Dystopian Fiction, so it's my fallback when I can't find something else to read. I was worried this one would be more of the same... strong female lead, moral dilemmas, bad guys with all the power, etc. It was. But, it was much more.<br /><br />I fell in love with the characters. All of them. I teared up when (if) they died and cheered for their triumphs. Jules is an awesome Dystopian Heroine.<br /><br />The writing was excellent. I like experiencing the stories through each person's point of view.<br />I enjoyed the cliff hangers... sorta. If I had read each book separately, and had to wait in between, it would have driven me crazy. In a good way. Like I couldn't wait to continue on with the story. The ending was satisfying. I like that it was very hopeful for the future, but still left a bit of tension between Luke, Peter, and Jules. Mr. Howey left it open, like we should expect more stories from the silos.<br /><br />OH! A big plus for me was the editing... a lot of the Kindle books I read are sloppily edited with weird breaks/ misspellings, etc. This one wasn't!<br /><br />Sorry if the review is disjointed... I don't usually make the effort to review books on both Amazon & Goodreads, but Mr. Howey said he reads them, and I think he deserves the praise!
B0074JODP8|5.0|[Note: This review is of the two-disc standard DVD package, not the single-disc Blu-ray edition.]<br /><br />On November 4-5, 2011, Joe Bonamassa and his current touring band, plus some special guests, played two shows at the legendary Beacon Theatre on Broadway and 74th Street in Manhattan, New York City.  This two-disc DVD set is a chronicle of those performances, similar to Bonamassa's popular Live From the Royal Albert Hall set issued in 2009.<br /><br />It is no surprise that this DVD lives up to the high standards of its predecessor, since it featured the same brain trust (producer Kevin Shirley and director Scot McFadyen).  If anything, the more intimate Beacon allows for more closeups and camera angles than were possible at the Albert Hall.  Both the video and audio are top-shelf here, as is the packaging by Bonamassa's J&R Enterprises production company.<br /><br />Disc One begins with a clever segment featuring Joe \\"busking\\" on a New York subway platform, then making his way on foot to the Beacon.  In a wry P.S. to his liner notes in the accompanying booklet, Joe says \\"I was not able to make a single dollar busking in the subway on 72nd Street...Isn't it great to be back in New York!!!!\\"  Those lucky enough to attend one of the Beacon shows would say Joe's return was, indeed, great!<br /><br />In what was a slight reversal from his set list earlier in the year, the concert itself opens with \\"Slow Train,\\" one of Joe's originals (co-written with producer Kevin Shirley) from his recent solo LP Dust Bowl, followed by his cover of Rory Gallagher's \\"Cradle Rock\\" (with a nice bit of slide work by Joe).  An awesome one-two punch, no matter the order.  Next up is Joe's own \\"When the Fire Hits the Sea,\\" a bouncy number from his 2010 LP Black Rock featuring some tasty honky-tonk piano from keyboardist Rick Melick.  Then the mood changes considerably when Joe pays tribute to the late Gary Moore with a beautiful and evocative rendering of Moore's \\"Midnight Blues,\\" masterfully played and sung.  The tempo changes again as Joe continues with his \\"Dust Bowl\\" and fan-favorite \\"The River\\" (co-written with Bob Held, from Joe's 2004 Had To Cry Today album).  On the latter, drummer Tal Bergman and bassist Carmine Rojas lay down a rock-solid, heavy groove, and Joe breaks out the slide again to excellent effect.<br /><br />The evening's first \\"special guest,\\" vocalist Beth Hart, did a guest spot on Dust Bowl before releasing a well-received album of soul tunes in collaboration with Bonamassa (Don't Explain) in 2011, just a few weeks before the Beacon show.  Here, she tears into Brooke Benton's \\"I'll Take Care of You\\" and the Lloyd Glenn/Lowell Fulson classic \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" (with Joe's bluesy slide work complimenting Hart's singing beautifully).  If there is any justice, this DVD and Don't Explain should help Hart gain the wider audience her unique voice deserves.<br /><br />After Hart's appearance, Joe kicks the tempo back into high gear with a rollicking version of Little Walter's \\"You Better Watch Yourself,\\" also from Dust Bowl.  This is followed by a couple of tunes from Black Rock, a cover of Bobby Parker's \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" and a touching rendering of Leonard Cohen's \\"Bird On a Wire\\" that practically re-invents the song (with the help of Joe's Gigliotti Telecaster-style guitar).<br /><br />Speaking of Cohen, an American musical treasure, the evening's second \\"special guest\\" is another of America's great singer-songwriters, the amazing John Hiatt. One of the highlights of the DVD is his collaboration with Joe on the haunting \\"Down Around My Place.\\"  Unforgettable.  Their blues-rock rendition of Hiatt's \\"I Know a Place\\" (which Joe covered on Black Rock) is also a treat.<br /><br />Following Hiatt's appearance, Joe and the band tear into Joe's original \\"Blue and Evil,\\" my favorite song on Black Rock.  Glad to see this one back on the set list, Joe!<br /><br />The evening's final \\"special guest\\" had to have been special indeed forBonamassa, since Paul Rodgers was lead singer for Free, one of Joe's favorite British blues-rock influences.  Rodgers' distinctive voice is in fine form on two Free classics, \\"Walk in My Shadow\\" and \\"Fire and Water\\" (Joe covered the former on his 2008 album Live From Nowhere in Particular).  Quite a treat watching Joe channel Paul Kossoff while sharing the stage with his hero's former bandmate.<br /><br />Disc One concludes with the set-closer \\"Mountain Time,\\" another fan favorite for nearly a decade (it debuted on Joe's album So It's Like That in 2002), with an intro featuring a medley of the Bonamassa instrumentals \\"India\\" and \\"Django.\\"  And then there's the encore, a blistering version of Mose Allison's \\"Young Man Blues\\" that gives The Who's rendition a run for its money.  Rojas and Bergman in particular have a blast on this one, and Joe makes splendid use of both necks on his \\"Hotel California\\" Gibson ES-1275.<br /><br />Disc Two features two Bonus songs, a cover of Warren Haynes's plaintive \\"If Heartaches Were Nickels\\" and Joe's crowd-pleasing acoustic tour de force \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" (co-written with Will Jennings, from Joe's 2003 album Blues Deluxe).  Also included is \\"A Friend Stops By,\\" an amusing backstage visit by David Crosby (who shows Joe a couple of tuning tricks), and \\"A Busker's Tale,\\" a tongue-in-cheek mini-documentary about Joe's busking adventure on the 72nd Street subway platform. Finally, there is a wonderful picture gallery (set to the studio version of \\"You Better Watch Yourself\\" and Joe's \\"Black Lung Hearache,\\" both from Dust Bowl), including shots of some other \\"special guests\\" (and guitars!) that didn't make it onto the DVD. Nice.<br /><br />The package is not without some relatively minor flaws:  Rodgers' name is misspelled, for instance, and the list of guitars used omits the Ernie Ball Music Man Steve Morse model Joe uses on \\"Mountain Time.\\"  More significantly, the booklet has \\"Fire and Water\\" and \\"Walk in My Shadow\\" reversed from theorder they appear on the DVD.  Oops!<br /><br />This well-produced package will prove a treat to long-time fans, and newcomers encountering Bonamassa's virtuosity and showmanship for the first time will find it hard to resist as well. It isn't easy these days to find a band focused more on the music than on the stage act, but Bonamassa, Melick, Rojas, and Bergman put out tight, excellent music with honesty and joy.  They're clearly enjoying themselves, and you will too. Highly recommended!

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was about the most reality show that I have seen in a long time. I grew up in this era and although we too were poor, had<br />no help and were \\"poor white trash\\", I was touched by the theme that this was written in. This was the real way that the so called \\"Rich\\" did treat people, and yes they were cruel. Some families treated their help as family members, but not very many.<br />I can't begin to say that I was very surprised that this has all come out in a book and movie. The cast was perfect. Love to see much more of this kind of reading.
B004ZNACA6|3.0|music of course most excellent= but was disappointed in disc presentation.  cardboard sleeves that are tight and will of course scratch discs each time you put them away .  for the musics sake discs should have had hard plastic covers to protect them...oh that's right -they are not meant to last forever

014241493X|5.0|I have written a five-star review of this book on my \\"noteworthy YA fiction\\" blog: The Stuff That Isn't Twilight, but I'll post an excerpt of it below:<br /><br />Let me get this out of the way now: John Green is a wonderfully talented author.  I whizzed through \\"Paper Towns\\" being so empathetic to Q and thoroughly intrigued by Margo.  The whole idea of who we see when we look at people, and who they are behind the mask is portrayed beautifully by Q's inability to let go of his childhood image of Margo and Margo's desperation for people to both see and not see her.  After finishing, I questioned my own way of assessing people through what they've said to me and their actions, and I wondered if any of that was real.  Who are the people around us? Who are they to their parents, their friends, their lovers? Are they the same person to everyone? If not, is that okay? Are we all liars?  These are the kinds of questions Green brings up throughout \\"Paper Towns.\\"  But Green also looks at the selfishness of identity, and the struggle to satisfy our own sense of self. Is what we want ourselves to be more important than what others need us to be? Is there a middle ground? Green creates Q and Radar and Margo each with similar and different wants and needs and allows them to all intertwine and crash.  Readers of any gender (as far as I can tell, since Q is a boy and I am a girl) will be able to understand and sympathize with Q's frustration and obsession and desperation for finding Margo and discovering how important it is to find out who she actually is.<br /><br />\\"Paper Towns\\" is the perfect novel for ages fourteen and up. Both the beginning trip between Q and Margo and the road trip with Q and Radar are incredibly engaging and have the perfect amount of hilarity, seriousness, and teenage crises. You won't be able to stop thinking about the book until you finish it.  All the questions running through Q's brain will run through yours, too, and you won't be able to help lookingat your own world differently.  Green wrote a simply inspiring piece that every teenager should pick up.

B003G4W49C|1.0|I first read this book as an angst-ridden teen, and I thought it was great. That was a long time ago and I recently re-read it as an adult, hoping for the same great experience. Not so much.<br />What seemed so deep and relevant to my 15 year old self was a little shallow to an adult. Not well written, the plot movement is glacial, the characters are very 2 dimensional. If you're still smarting over being picked on in school, you might find this interesting. If you've grown up and become an adult, probably less interesting. And, seriously, I'm waiting to stumble across Ender's Lunch, Ender's Afternoon Nap, Ender's Trip To The Grocery Store. Doesn't this author have any other ideas?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and since it comes out tomorrow, 3/23/12, I figured I could do it in two nights. Well, it didn't take me two nights, I read it in 5 hours. I could not stop reading this book. I have never been so engrossed in a book. I actually welled up when one of the characters died, won't say who, but those who have read it probably know who I'm talking about.I would recommend this book and I would have given it more stars if possible. I can't wait to get started on the second one.

0439023521|5.0|In the ruins of America lies Panem a country of wealthy snobs keeping genuine people under a strict bootheel. As punishment for an almost centuries old rebellion each year The Hunger Games are held. Two children (a boy and girl between the ages of 12 to 18) are chosen from each of the 12 Districts of Panem. The Games are anything but fun, but rather a sadistic display of violence and murder in the tradition of Gladiator combat. When her sister is chosen, 16 year old Katniss Everdeen sacrifices herself instead taking the childs place.<br /><br />Does the young Bow Hunter have what it takes to survive?<br /><br />I first became aware of \\"The Hunger Games\\" because of the forthcoming film. I didn't really pay much attention to it. Then my nephew told me of the book, he's 16 and not much of a reader so if he liked it it occurred to me to check it out. I ordered it here and got it two days later on a Monday. By Wednesday I was finished. I highly recommend this book, but be warned it's brutal, the author Suzanne Collins has a way of putting the reader right in the thick of things. I could feel myself in the arena with Katniss, feel the blistering heat of the wall of flame, feel the sting of the Tracker Jackers and shiver along with Peeta as he succumbed to blood poisoning.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a must read for Genre and Non-Genre fans alike.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|dont get me wrong, i adored this whole triogy but at the end i felt like some things never got answered.  at the end, i felt like there needed to be another book to &#34;end it farther&#34;.  i felt like when you settle down in a zombie infeated world, there would always be something going on (know what im getting at?) i would prefer there to be another book explaining all of the information we have just learned from the The Death Cure.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This is a great cover so far.  Nothing too fancy, but gets the job done.  Stand function works well, and seems to hold the kindle in place fairly well.
0439023513|2.0|I started reading The Hunger Games trilogy Monday, after I decided that I was probably missing something since it's such a phenomenon (then again, I also thought this of The Twilight Saga and..well...anyway.). The Hunger Games was amazing. Shattering. Literally had me in tears multiple times and I immediately bought tickets to the movie in IMAX. Catching Fire was a little...well...muddled, but second books in trilogies usually are and it wasn't by any means BAD, just...completely different from what I thought it would be. I wondered how the hell it was going to end, and eagerly moved into Mockingjay. After I finished, one word came to mind:<br /><br />Seriously?<br /><br />She completely ignores personal relationships, both past and present, when they were initially the basis of the Katniss character and why she did what she did the way she did. She launches from one scene to another with dizzying speed and no real segue to speak of. Characters she had thus spent the entire trilogy making you care for were killed off with no more than a seemingly distracted sentence; several times I had to re-read a paragraph to make sure that character had really just been killed.<br /><br />There's absolutely no sense of the characters as people anymore. She'd spent so much time in character development, in little scenes that somehow gave startling insight into who the other characters were, that I found her blithe insertion of names to be trite and almost insulting in their lack of introduction. Basically, for the most part, you can tell who died because she essentially tosses in random names with no personalization whatsoever. Token body count fluffer to your left, random_dude_01 to your right. And while I understand that with war comes senseless violence, the \\"final battle\\" scene is exceedingly gratuitous, even to someone as bloodthirsty as I consider myself.<br /><br />From someone who had spent so much time making the scene of Rue's death so heartbreakingly poignant to go from that to this pile of crap...maybe she took a whack to the head we don't know about while writing this? I don't know.<br /><br />Then there's the story. It's so unbelievably rushed, crammed, and at some points nonsensical that I was at times confused. It almost seems like she was thinking about making into a four-book series, said screw it, and crammed everything in just to finish it off.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because...hm. I actually don't know. I guess I gave it two stars because the first book got to me so completely, and the second one seemed like it could've been going somewhere great. Two stars for sentimentality, but on its own? Maybe half a star. I truly can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a book.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|It's fun as Angry Birds always is.  However, on my Kindle Fire, the way you let go of the slingshot can change the angle of the bird.  I didn't experience this with the other versions.  A new twist is instead of collecting special items, when you hit a special item it unlocks a mini-game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|goodly good. ghost good it was a good game i like it a lot it a lot players play it please
B003A4IFGY|1.0|Im a huge To Petty fan so when this album was released i was really looking forward to it. Then i listen to it. It took all i had to listen to it one time, its terrible, what  a huge disappointment. This will not effect my love of Tom Petty but next time ill listen to the tracks of a new CD 1st before buying it
B004T2QZL8|1.0|the game worked fine for the first couple mins then would foreclose every few seconds. don't waste your time or money
B007MNV5WU|5.0|No, the paid version don't have ads.<br /><br />It is an awesome game, for me at least.<br />And I don't mind paying for this to support the developers, after all, I have played all the angry birds available for Android.<br /><br />People need to understand one thing, just because you don't pay for something does not make it free to make. Support the developers!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I went to the movies with my grown daughter the other day and the first trailer was for the movie version of \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I was drawn in immediately. After ignoring this book for a very long time, I purchased it online two days ago and just finished it. I was impressed.<br /><br />The best part about reading this book is that it reminded me of what reading was like as a child. The book drew me in and my brain was able to conjure up the most vivid images of what I was reading about - just like it did when I was growing up.<br /><br />It also reminded me of what it was like to explore the back woods of the rural town I grew up in. I loved reading about the valley, the trees, the streams, the birds, the moss, etc.<br /><br />Good for the author for having such a great imagination - we could all use a little more of that!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I dislike the game. I wasted my on it. don't buy it is nothing like what u think it willbb like
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I had heard varying reports about whether Season 2 was as good as Season 1 of Downton Abbey. It's every bit as good or better and immensely addiciting! When I started watching it with friends I couldn't get rid of them until they saw it all!!! There is humour primarily provided by the excellent Maggie Smith and tragedies brought about by WW1 and the Spanish flu. One of my favourite characters, Mr Bates, stoically faces even greater trials and tribulations as a result of others. Thomas continues his slimy ways. As usual with BBC productions, the attention to detail is great and the scenery beautiful. The story also continues to reflect the great social changes occuring around that time. Basically it's a complicated period soap opera but an excellent one. Can't wait for Season 3. Highly recommended.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|i ve read a few thousand books and its the first time in my life i write a review to protect whoever i can from this stupidity. i am so sorry i paid for this totally boring totally badly written so called book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|What a sad life the title character had to endure and yet she was strong and maintained her dignity and good will. To be a woman or to be poor in that era was not a load of laughs! Both leads were excellent and I found the retelling true to the original story. The atmosphere and cinematography were suitably dark and a little forbodeing but perfectly in keeping with the nature of the story. Very enjoyable.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|It's time where I do reviews for movies either released in 2002 or 1992. This is 2002 in film Blade II. Blade II is a fun action packed seqeul & I don't know if it's just me but I almost always like the seqeul more than the 1st film. It was directed BY Guillermo del Toro he direct both He'  l  loy movies. Wesley Snipes & Kris Kristofferson return you also get Ron Perlman as Reinhadt, Thomas Ketchmann as Eli Damaskinos, Luke Goss as Paitent 1, Leonor Varel as Nyssa & Norman Reedus as Josh,. Story is it's 2 years after the 1st movie Blade has been looking for Whistler cause he didn't die in the 1st movie. This new breed of vampire is posing as a homeless person he brutally kills some people at the beginning. You have Blade chasing down some vampire's in the opening in an excellent action scene great stunt work with the motorcycles. He takes 1 of the vampire & keeps him alive to get into this dr  u  g lab he cleans house & he finds Whislter being kept in this tank thing. He takes him bake to the hide ut where he can get better. Then you are introduced to Josh. Whistler recovers & well he doesn't like Josh too much. The lair has been breached some vampire's dressed as ninja's come in Blade has a brief fight they want to seek a truce cause they need Blade's help. He agree's & teams up with a group known as the Bloodpack. Blade starts having problems with a memeber of the pack Reinhardt he puts an explosive device in his head so if he turns on him he can be taken out. So they go to this night club Whistler is a look out on the roof Josh is in the van outside. While the team is in the club all<br />h  e  l  l breaks loose. You have 1 of the members of the pack that is attacked by a reaper another guy is atttacked but it looks like he will be ok. Just losts of great gunplay. The van comes under attack Josh figures out that light is there weakness. So they use their flashlights on their guns to take The Reapers down. Blade has a fight with Paitent 1. The pack had to take 1 of their own down cause he was infected. So we get back to the base where Josh creats LED gernades to combat The Reapers. So at daylight they raid the sewers & just a big action packed batle breaks out. That guy that you think was fine urns he starts attacking Whistler this red headed chick who was his girlfirend is about to be attacked she goes up the  ladder to the surface where there both fired. You have Blade, Nyssa & Reinhardt fighting off hundreds of Reapers. Nyssa & 1 of her pack members find this area where The Reapers feed. He gets pwnd by a swarm of Reapers Blade tells Nyssa to run he uses The LED gernade & takes out that swarm. Lots & I mean lots of gunplay through the tunnels. Blade decides to set off all the gernades & wipes out the enitre horde. Paitent 1 confonts Whistler & tells him whats going on. Most of the team is dead except for Nyssa & Reinhardt. It was a set up Blade & Whistler are taken to The Consil building. Josh has been working Damaskinos all along. Damaskinos is going to use Blade to create an army of Daywalkers. Blade tries to set off the explosive device that he put into Reinhardt Josh tells him it's a dud. Reinhardt pulls it out & gives the device to Josh Blade says that you're wrong it's not a dud he sets it off & he blows up in a nice practical effect. There going to drain Blade of his blood. Paitent 1 comes in & wrecks shop. Whistler loosens his handcuffs while Reinhardt is distracted. He beats him up & escapes through the vents he shoots through the vents & kills the guy that was holding Blade. While they are escaping Reinhardt is shooting at them Blade is weak he makes his way to a blood pool & regains his streagth. Blade fights off a buch of henchies. Wesley Snipes & Ron Perlman have a great fight Blade kills him. Damaskinos is trying to escape his Daughter Nyssa should've told you about that earlier turns on him. Paitent 1 who is also Damiskinos son kills him. Nyssa wants Paitent 1 to infect her to complete the circle Blade shows up they have a well done fight scene with Blade taken him down. Nyssa has been infected she asskes Blade to put her outside so she can go out a vampire. Then you back to that guy from the beginning that Blade let live he's in some st  rip club he goes to a booth Blade is on the other side he says \\"Now you didn't think that I forgot about you.\\" He gets pwnd in a nice little touch of humor. I'm sorry if I was vauge but Blade II is a lot of fun. Other than the CGI it's an excellent movie. Guillermo del Toro did a very good job. Wesley Snipes was great. Kris Kristofferson was very good & he hadd more to do, Ron Perlman was good. Leonar Verlena did a really good job. Norman Reedus was ok. Thomas Kerschmann was pretty good. Luke Goss did a good job. I'm not reviewin Blade Trinity that will be in a couple of years maybe but I can say it's a weak sequel. Blade II though check it out if you haven't seen it.
B005974CNA|5.0|I got this CD when it first came out. Dream Theater is probably my favorite band, definitely were years ago. Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds & Silver Linings, the two prior Dream Theater albums, were very fun for the first two days, and dropped deeply in quality as time passed by. I didn't like the direction that Mike Portnoy was pushing DT in. I was very excited when I found out MP left DT, and was replaced by Mike Mangini.<br /><br />This album is definitely a DT style album; MP leaving didn't really change that aspect, but changed some of the modern elements MP seemed to try and integrate into the band. The drumming is great, if not mixed too low..though I am not too put off by the low mix of the drums. Luckily, the bass is mixed higher than previous albums, and the album feels fuller.<br /><br />This album is amazing. It starts off strongly with the slow intro and literally epic keyboard riff with \\"On the Backs of Angels,\\" a very progressive song that isn't immediately catchy.<br /><br />The next two tracks, \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" and \\"Lost Not Forgotten,\\" would be the 2 tracks I would leave as B-sides. BMUBMD is alright for a few listens but I mostly skip it. LNF is much better but seems to lack direction sometimes. I am finding it growing on me, so I may eventually retract my statement of it being a B-side.<br /><br />The first ballad, \\"This is the Life,\\" gets a lighter, very atmospheric mood going, and it feels wonderful. Labrie shines here, as do Petrucci and Rudess.<br /><br />Next up are two \\"mini-epics\\" or longer songs, \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" and \\"Outcry.\\" BITS has, without a doubt, one of the best choruses ever, certainly DT's best chorus in my opinion. It's just an over all well-constructed song, and may be my favorite. Outcry is a very dense and technically proficient song, as if they took much inspiration from \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" and gave it lyrics. Powerful duo of songs.<br /><br />Another ballad comes in, \\"Far From Heaven,\\" and it's a really simple, short song, and it is really beautiful, if not very melancholy. It also leads into the album's stellar gift, \\"Breaking All Illusions.\\" (There is a musical connection between these two songs, though I forget what it is exactly). BAI is one of those songs that just flies by because you don't want it to stop. It's not as progressive as Outcry, but it's progressive nonetheless. So many nice things...and it's prog in every sense of the genre's meaning. A true DT song, I think many would say.<br /><br />The album could have ended there, but DT gives us a closure in the form of \\"Beneath the Surface.\\" This is just a gorgeous song. Pretty simple (no bass and very minimal percussion), with acoustic guitar plucking and various keyboard arrangements that just fill out the song perfectly. There is a keyboard solo that would theoretically be out of place, but it actually makes the song even better.<br /><br />All in all, I gave this 5 stars because it is a great return to form after the last 2 albums, and almost all of the songs are at least 8/10. If you fell out of love with DT, this album may pull you back in, if you're not over the prog metal genre (of which I'm mostly not a fan).
0780624890|4.0|Before I review Blade II for 2002 in film I'm going to do the 1st movie in the series. Now Blade is just a solid movie. I never read the comic growing up I believe they used the character in the Spider Man animated series from the 90's. Blade was directed by Stephen Norrington he directed Death Machine & Leauge Of Extraordinary Gentlemen which is why he hasn't directed anything in a long time. It stars Wesley Snipes as Blade, Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler, N Bushe Wright as Dr Karen Jenson, Donal Louge as Quinn & Stephen Dorff as Frost. The story is this woman has a baby & she was bitten by a vampire & the baby grows up to be part Vampire though. The doctors think that she was bitten by an animal she dies. 30 years later the boy becomes a vampire hunter known as Blade. So night Blade goes to this club where vampires hang out at & he cleans house & uses some sharp objects to stick this 1 vampire Quinn to a wall he's a right hand man for the villain in this movie. Quinn is set on fire. So then you are introduced to Dr Karen Jenson & this co worker they hint at a realationship the burnt of Quinn comes into the building where they look over it Quinn comes back to life brutally attacks the co worker of Dr Jenson's. he bites Dr Jenson. Blade shows up he cuts his hand off & knocks Quinn out a window. Blade is confronted by police 1 of them shoots at Blade he tells the cop \\" MF'er are you that d  a  m  n dumb\\"! He takes Dr Jenson with him to see if his friend Abraham Whistler can help her. Then you're introduced to Frost who is at this place called The Shadow consil this Elder Vampire is mad at him for holding rave's & different things of the sort. He would rather just co exist with humans. Later on Dr Jenson gets up Whister & Blade tell her what is going on Blade takes her home & there is this cop questioning Dr Jenson who truns out to be with Frost's group he is a \\"Familar\\" a human that wants to become a vampire. Blade was using Dr Jenson to go after this guy sohe can find out where Quinn is at. Blade beats that guy up & he finds blood samples in his trunk that Familar runs off Blade follows him to a Vampire Libary he tells Blade where the samples are kept after Blade beat him up pretty good. Blade & Dr Jenson go to the basement where they come across this fat vampire. Meanwhile that Familar tells Frost what Blade did he is killed. That fat Vampire tells Blade what Frost is trying to do he is trying to become a Vampire G  o  d. Blade is looking around he sees this girl running around he tries to help her he has been tricked by Quinn who is back with a bunch of henchies Whistler busts throuhg he says did I catch you all at a bad time he guns some vampires down. Blade fights some of the vampires on the subway system good fight scenes Quinn's face is messed up & he loses his hand again. Blade & Jensons escapes on 1 of the subway cars. Dr Jenson makes a weapon that can blow up vampires. Meanwhile Frost kills The Elder Vampire & takes contol of the consil. Blade & Frost have a confrontation on the streets while Frost holds a kid hostage where Blade can't take the shot. He tries to make Blade join them. Frost tosses the kid into the road Blade saves her before she is hit by this bus. While that's going on Quinn goes to Blade's hideout Whistler is beat badly for Blade to find when he comes back he wants Blade to give him his gun & walk off he kills himself Quinn took Dr Jenson as well. So Blade goes to Frost's hideout & he goes in there pwns a bunch of vampires he fights this male & female vampire good fight scene Blade uses that weapon that Dr Jenson made on them they both bloat up & blow up. Blade enter this room where he finds this woman that turns out to be his mother. Frost's henchies attack him Frost tells him that he is the 1 who bit her. Frost needs Blade along with 12 other pure vampires for this cermony so he can become a Blood G  o  d. Dr Jenson was thrown in this pit where that co worker from earlier is some kind of monster now she escapes to go find Blade who is being drained of his blood Dr Jenson allows him to take her blood so he can regain his strenght. Blade has a quick fight with his mother  he kills her. He guns down Frost's henchies he takes out Quinn once & for all Dr Jenson kills this 1 female associte of Frost's. Blade has his fight with Frost it's a well done fight scene. He can't kill him cause he is powerful now. He uses those serium & sticks them into Frost's head & he blows up. Blade refuses a cure by Dr Jenson cause he needs to continue the battle & that's pretty much the movie. I'm sorry if I was too vauge with the plot. Stephen Norrington did a pretty good job directing. Wesley Snipes did a good job. Kris Kristofferson did a good job in the small role he was given. N Bushe Wright did an alright job. Donal Louge was good you could tell he was having fun with the role. Stephen Dorff was decent next I will do Blade II.
B000GCFO08|4.0|I give this movie 3.5 stars. Intriguing, but not very original story draws you in. The imagery and cinematography are fantastic and create an ominous atmosphere and a sense of doom.<br />I found Rose to be a horror movie cliche, with her string of moronic decisions. ***SPOILER*** High tailing it to Silent Hill like she is an escaped con. Oh yeah, and I'll drag my young and obviously traumatized daughter with me, but not my husband. What could go wrong?! The way she flees from the police officer for no apparent reason. Smart move mommy. And while she is on a roll, why not drive like a maniac and crash through a fence. You see, then her vehicle gets damaged and she and her child are stranded in Silent Hill, which looks a lot like a war zone and a little like the gates of hell. Sleepwalking daughter does her thing. Now we've got a plot. Shes got to find her daughter! The most believable character was the female police officer.<br />The movie took a silly turn with all the religious zealots and their actions. And from there, it sort of dragged on for me. Ending was good. All in all it was okay. Not that scary.
B005OGYH90|4.0|I really like the live cuts on the cd's. They show just how good of a guitarist and performer Slash is! Myles Kennedy's voice and range is a little weak on some songs, maybe due to singing outside of his range but still by far one of the best hard rock vocalists of his generation. The DVD could have had a few more songs I felt but still good enough to enjoy!!!

He always has the most lovable characters, crisp writing and interesting story-lines, but this book tops it all. But as much as I loved this book, I would highly recommend another book I love.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|I ordered the white (Japan only) Nintendo Wii/GC controller and did get the right ones - the Japanese version with the long cord as described. I see others reporting they did not, but I can only guess that their orders were fulfilled by a different vendor. ?? About all I can suggest is that when ordering, make sure it says the order is being fulfilled by Topken Corporation (AKA: Toys and Games Outlet).<br /><br />The box and info insert were in Japanese and it does have the 10' cord (nice!!!). We play Tiger Woods golf with it and if you've ever played the game, you know it is critical that your buttons and pads work correctly or you're not going to have any fun. So far so good!! (I only wish it could improve my real golf game!) The controllers work like they should, and feel just as sturdy and well-made as the originals. I hope they hold up as well. If not, I will update this review.<br /><br />Grab them now while you can!! These are getting pretty hard to find and the price is fair. ($43.88 + free shipping)

B0037RDPEG|5.0|Took me a few years but finally got around to buying this for my Kindle. I struggled somewhat getting into the moral philosophies, sentimentality and overall self-awareness of the author, and her openness when speaking about her depression, perhaps as I come from a place where such issues are considered taboo. In essence, I found her quite 'whingy' for want of a better word. However, the book eventually became un-put-down-able. Gilbert has an amazing ability to create a fictionalised prose and picturesque world with her writing, so much so that it's incredible to read her words and think 'this actually happened!' I always find it important that elements of history, sociology etc. are included in a narrative, and this is my favourite way of learning history about the world. Reading this book I learned a lot about the original focus and premise of yoga and meditation, various religious faiths, general spirituality, the history of Bali and overall Indonesia, India, Italy and the Italian language. To me, a book has been successful if it makes me want to Google something, and leads onto wanting to read something else. As such, from reading about Gilbert's fascination with Italian, it has made me want to learn Spanish, as well as yoga, meditation, and given me a realisation that one can use spiritual means to overcome depression and general unhappiness. *SPOILER ALERT* The love story made me want to buy the sequel immediately! A MUST READ.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Would give it five stars if it didn't duplicate what I had already created. At least make it an option to not allow duplicates and I'll give five stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing.  I'm not normally a fiction person but what a book... so well written and my god, the topic.  The concept is horrifying but captivating at the same time.

In the beginning of the book you are thinking to yourself how horrific the plot is and how appalling the subject matter but in a good way.  In a way that makes you want to read the book.  Eventually I gave into the games and got so engrossed and so attached to some of the characters.  What a great read. May the odds be ever in your favor ;)
B007BDK3SS|3.0|While this game has potential it falls well short of good. The biggest problems are poor level design, mixed with bugs and glitches. Your cycle gets stuck on things or at the bottom of drops, and the only way to get out is try to crash yourself. Problem is that sometimes its hard to do that. Your rider just ends up on his back, cycle in the sky.  They need to improve this game significantly before I would recommend paying for it.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I just want to know why Rovio chose to screw Kindle Fire users by making this explicitly unavailable for us. Shame. And on the same day release the only available version of Rio to Kindle users in HD as well as a money grab. I enjoy our angry avian friends, but I disapprove of the marketing method of Rovio. I'd happily pay the 99 cents for the normal versions of the Disgruntled Winged-ones, but when you make the purposefully not work, it just makes ME an Angry Bird.<br /><br />Edit: Sideloaded the free version from the official market over to my Kindle. Guess what? It works fine.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Downloaded for my kindle fire.<br />Game played well to a certain point then force closes everytime I try to make anything new.<br />Hoping these reviews reach the devs so they'll fix this problem.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I like this game on the PC version, but it always crashes and burns on my phone. Also, it doesn't always like to load up and will sit on the load screen for up to five minutes.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|worked fine with the exception of some lag while combining.  played from start to finish and the game worked better than in the past on the same phone.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|AFTER WHITNEY'S DEATH I WANTED SOMETHING TO REMEMBER HER AND THE DVD AND CD'S I RECEIVED FROM AMOZON WAS SPEEDY AND GREAT VALUE...ALL WORKED AND EVER LASTING PLEASED WITH YOUR SERVICE
0985081821|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. The Sophia character is interesting, yet most people in her small town think she's weird. Strange things start to happen and she finds out her small town isn't quite what it seemed to be. I can't wait until the next book to see what happens to Sophia!<br /><br />If you like this you will probably like House of Night/Zoey Redbird series by: P.C. Cast
0061564893|3.0|1421 is an entertaining book.  While reading it, I had a hard time not believing it. The author is very skilled at providing just enough information to make you believe but not enough to convince.  It is best read as entertainment.<br />The orignal premise of the voyage of discovery was that the emperor wanted to increase the lands offering tribute.<br />If that is true then the rest of the story follows.  Yet Marco Polo arrived in China in the 1270 timeframe so if the emperor wanted to increase his status, he would have sent an army back with Marco when he returned to Italy.<br /><br />Anthropologists and Archeologists need to rely on written evidence to justify and convince. There may have been earlier contact than what is commonly accepted.  After all if the present coastal migration theory from Africa holds, then there was always a link for all the peoples.  The author tried to make this link more immediate. As for me, I am skeptical.
B00701897I|5.0|The movie is great! but the Blu-Ray disc that they sent in my package was defective, it would stay stuck on a loading compass for about an hour and wouldnt change, but with Amazon's Amazing customer support they just replaced it! its a good deal, very cheap price for such a good movie, i didnt want it to end! I rarely say that!!!
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|I am not 20 something, more like 60 something, but this whole album is so<br />timely to express the frustration that middle America (what's left of it...)<br />feel!  It doesn't pussy foot about what is the cause of the morass we're in<br />and lays the blame just where it belongs!  Wish Bruce would let O'Bama use<br />any of the cuts for his theme song!  I've never seen our country so caustically<br />run by the 1% plutocrats who feel they no longer have to hide their Ayn Rand<br />roots of hatred of anything altruistic and at the same time, contemptuous of<br />middle American in our voicing shared woes.  Bruce lends voice to our times...again!
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|Movie and extra features are good I just hate the fact that the digital copy is one of the ultra violet copies that needs multiple user names and is not campatible with iTunes!
B004I9CXHW|3.0|I have a 2011 GTI (standard radio).  It was easy to swap out this cable in place of iPod compatible one that came stock.  I had to buy another cable with a microUSB end to plug into the phone; it charges the phone just fine.  But that's where the good experience ends.  I don't want to blame the product entirely, because some of the blame probably falls on my phone (HTC sensation).  Back when I had an iPhone,  it was a seemless integration: you plugged it in, and your songs were there in a logical file order.  But now plugging in the HTC, the songs are all over the place and in weird folders.  Some artists/songs are where I'd expect, but others are nowhere to be found.  It works, but it just doesn't do what I want it to.<br /><br />Maybe if I went into my phone's memory and re-formatted everything into one file it would work better (but may screw it up?).  Frankly i just use it to charge and use the awesome bluetooth module in the GTI to stream music wirelessly.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great. no problems. very accurate. works great on my kindle fire. would recommend to anyone. not much else to say.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This has to be one of the best seasons of Breaking Bad. It is sad that next season will be the last but I think we deserve to know what will happen to Walt.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games can be fun, and I don't mind having to earn my way through the game. My only complaint is that the descriptions of the games you are purchasing are somewhat lacking and can be quite difficult.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|Case was not the appropriate size for phone. I recently have ordered otter box covers for other phones and they have all fit correctly. However, this case for the samsung galaxy sII did not fit. I needed to return product. Do not recommend this product.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is probably the best, most useful app I have!  You get lots of versions of the Bible to chose from.  It will also read them out loud to you! And it's free! Plus there are great devotionals to choose from.  To buy the books included in this great app would be expensive.  Thanks for a great app.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|it use real money to buy gems and coins I got rid of that instantly a waste of time if you ask me.
B004GYY714|5.0|such a great app! although I am so far from home,  I can receive tons of radio stations in my mother language.  highly recommend if u like listening to radio programs!  love it! great with speaker as well, very clear sound quality and no bugs or stops.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this is an awesome app but u might have to pay but not if you don't dpendcall ur money as soon as you get it in other words use the money like real money spend wisely ;) another problem is you can only play it on wick or with Internet connection but it really fun I would soliloquy recommend this to anyone download it now
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Everyone needs to read this trilogy. It has such an ageless quality about it, it is captivating for both young and old. The characters are believable and most importantly loveable. The reader really feels the characters' emotions, both joyful and tragic. Someday when I have children I will give them these books to read along with Harry Potter, The Hobbit, and Lord of the Rings. Suzanne Collins has really done it!
B00319ECC4|5.0|I have been with Fear Factory for many years and this one is just awesome. I am also into the techno side of things and this has some bits of it. pure wonderful noise
B0052UZIFA|1.0|the app won't load on the galaxy nexus. upgraded from the Motorola Droid in hopes that it would work, but once again I'm left wanting it to work.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|This movie is a bourne wannabe.  Centered around the CIA and intelligence community, it has lots of fast action with hand-held cameras and frequent cuts within each scene.  I'd say it's a fairly well directed movie with good cinematography.<br /><br />Where it falls short, in my opinion, is the characters - and particularly the main character.  The main character is a youngish agent who is proprietor of a safe house.  He's bored; and he wants to prove himself.  He has a girlfriend - and he tells her that he's in some benign profession (he doesn't want her to know he's CIA).<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a renegade (former) agent carrying some high-stakes intel.<br /><br />The main character (the youngish agent, who's name escapes me) remains undeveloped throughout the movie.  And as a consequence, I had no reason to care about him.  Denzel Washington's character was marginally developed; and I barely cared about him.  The young agent's girlfriend communicated her feelings fairly well (although she had hardly any part to play in the movie); and by the end of the movie, I cared about her.<br /><br />Despite the fast action and constant threats against the two main characters, I found the movie generally boring.  So I say to the writers, the director, and the actors:  make me care!<br /><br />And by the way, the red lipstick on that CIA woman just drove me crazy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Unless you are fixated on in-your-face BDSM sexual encounters, happening over and over and OVER again, the same stuff, just in different settings and different sequences -- with barely any interesting plot line (oh, he had a difficult childhood which made him have this need for Dominance in sex, along with his huge appetite for same, yawnnn, how original) -- then you will not find this book one bit interesting.  I read the whole thing, thinking I might DISCOVER something worth all the time it was taking to read it.  Never happened.  I will not  --repeat NOT -- be reading any of the following two in the trilogy.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this game is so fun and now that they have fix the force close problem its worth it's!! you could totally get it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|As I begin to write this review, I am still not quite sure how I ultimately feel about this book.  I downloaded the book after hearing several friends comment on how they could not wait until some quiet time to spend with Christian Grey and that it was a must for everyone to read.  I am a sucker for a good romantic trilogy.  So, without pre-reading anything about the books or the author, I began to read this at 8pm last night knowing I had to get up early in the morning.  I read it straight through until 3am this morning and finished the book.  I am still unsure as to why I kept reading it.  I was completely annoyed with the obviously British phrasing, even though all the characters are American born and raised.  Also, the fact that a 21-year-old college student did not own a computer nor a cell phone, have an email account or know how to even use a computer completely drove me insane.  This was not a story about an Amish girl going to the big city!  The dialogue between Ana and Christian sounded like it came from a novel written about a couple in 18th Century England.  I was shocked when it made reference to the year being 2011.  To me, the most realistic dialogue in the whole book came from the emails they sent back and forth to each other.  I found those to be entertaining and actually made me smile.  So here comes the \\"mixed\\" part of my review......with all of the things that drove me nuts about the horrible writing, I was hooked and could not put the book down.  I was actually drawn into the characters despite wanting their conversations to sound like actual people of their age and setting.  However, I am not sure I was drawn in enough to spend $10 to read the next book and relive the same scenes over and over again.  I gave this book 2 stars because of the author's inability to make me feel like this is a book about 2 young Americans in the 21st Century.  It would have found it much more believable if the setting were in England.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Rarely do I like so many songs on one album...Adele 21 is that rarity. This is a keeper! A bonus--I can even understand her lyrics! Beautiful music.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|A good, low profile case with nice functionality.  Makes it easy to prop up the kindle in a horizontal position to watch movies or whatever you may be looking at.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|I originally found this band by accident, but have been a fan ever since.  They have a very fast paced energetic feel to their music which is great for running, or just rocking out in your car.  I also enjoy the verbal intros and environmental sound effects in their music.  It gives you a real feel of being around a campfire with other rockers.  There is quite a bit of the the male growly/scream vocals mixed with clean female singing. If you do not like this style, you might want to look elsewhere.  I really enjoy Beauty and the Beast Metal so this is right up my alley.  This is their best album by far, but the earlier two are just a little behind the quality of this recording.  Needless to say, they are all worth buying and enjoying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a awesome game to play in free time or any time.<br /> love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!this game is awesome .got to get this game everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With the release of the movie imminent, I can't go anywhere, turn on the television or pick up a newspaper without seeing something about The Hunger Games.  A few weeks ago in the bookstore I picked up the book to see what all the buzz was about.  Frankly, I thought the premise was kind of disgusting.  I put the book back down and walked away.<br /><br />I teach creative writing to a group of teenagers every week.  Most of them are also avid readers and we often talk about our favorite books.  One of them asked if I had read The Hunger Games. I expressed my concerns.  The student explained how the book was about so much more.  Katniss wanted to protect her family, her community and that she was strong and determined.<br /><br />Not wanting a creative, knowledge, thirsty student to think I was an old and nerdy adult, I downloaded the book to my Kindle that evening.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down.  The Hunger Games is by far the most compelling book I have read in ages.  It's a story with the ability to set the reader firmly in the mindset of the characters.  It's fast moving, high tension and every chapter ends with a hook that keeps you wanting more and more and more.  On the few occasions I did have to put the book down to do something like sleep or eat, I anxiously awaited the time I could delve into the story again.  It's not often that a book draws me in so completely.<br /><br />I'm not young and crazy enough to get tickets for the midnight showing tonight, but now that I'm half way through book two, you can bet I'll be at the movie soon. The Hunger Games is captivating.  Don't let this one pass you by.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Would get a higher rating if it didn't force close and is now unplayable after only 42 combinations.  It doesn't speak well about the developer if everyone has the same complaint and nothing is being done.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I purchased one of these years ago & wore it out,loved it,so bought another one.  This one does not work near as well.  Wish I had never gotten it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love the wide variety of versions to choose from. quick and easy to use; much better than I figured it would be for a free app.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|The movie was GREAT as was the condition of the DVD,If they do a remake of the next 2 parts \\"Hornets Nest\\" \\"Played with Fire\\" I will be ordering the Blu-Ray version of them also........very satisfied,Ken
B000024IFB|5.0|this album is a masterpiece and my favourite MJ album. Because it's the album that MJ tells about himself \\"most\\". his anger, his emotions, his fears, his power... every song is a masterpiece.<br /><br />and \\"little susie\\".... a normal man cannot create that song. MJ wrote it and he is beyond this earth.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I realy like this game but it is very hard and frustrating. some times I want to explode in to a million pices.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|\\"I DID NOT ENJOY THIS BOOK\\" said a member of our four member book club at the beginning of our meeting in Feb 2012.  Two others wholeheartedly agreed.  A synopsis of our gathering is \\" This book is not about Navy SEAL Teams or, as far as we could find out, about SEALS.  All three members of our book club (each 70 plus years old) who didn't care for the book are retired Vets.  One a retired Navy Submariner and Intell Analyst, another a retired Army Special Forces member, the third, a US Army Demo Expert and Anti-IED expert w/ several tours in Iraq.  The book is simply a compendium of vignettes in which the the main character and hero is former Sniper Chris Kyle.  He downplays his fellow SEAL sniper \\"team\\" members and SEAL officers.  The author's attitude is not one that our group could readily associate with a member of an elite Amerian Special Operations organization.  He leaves a charicature of our SEALS as an unruly, poorly disciplined, super-macho, group of prima donnas.  We don't believe this is a true picture.  A Sniper's Mission requires more or less solitary operations as amember of a \\"Sniper Team\\".  Given this, Special Operations individuals and organizations as a rule avoid the spotlight and definitely don't go in for self-praise.  The Author racked up a significant number of kills, by any calculation.  At one point the author mentioned some of the skills involved in sniping and began to describe the evolution of tactics for urban fighting; our group believed he missed an excellent opportunty to further interest,involve, and educate the reader but he did not.  In short we believe the book is not worth reading and definitely not worth buying.  DESMOND
0307593312|4.0|1Q is in some ways vintage Murakami. I prefer his fictions way more than any of his non-fiction works. There is no middle of the road with him - Murakami's works are either strictly fact based or wildly fantastic and this was the latter. Part I is what I imagine how a mental patient slowly losing grip with reality must feel. Part II unfolds a love story. Part III gives a satisfying Holywood ending to a tale of destinies.<br /><br />Reading Murakami, I usually suspend my disbelief and allow myself to be led by the author to different times and places as fantastic as a Tim Burton movie. There is just enough groundedness in the characters to make me identify with them. Throughout the journey, I allow myself to get into discussions with the author about the meaning of cults, the need for spiritual life, ghosts, the meaning of sex, love and alas, life. How many people have lived most of their lives, matas without dohtas or dohtas without matas? One message of the story seems to be: whatever happens, if you find a part of you missing, you should do everything you can to try to reunite with that missing part.<br /><br />I don't have time to read a lot of fiction and it took me a while to finish this book. There were times I felt that Murakami might have gotten just a little too sure of himself and liked the sound of his own voice just a little too much. But still I felt sad and a little lost when the book was finished.<br /><br />And that isn't a bad ride.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy will make you smile and cry. The characters are so real that you are hoping that they will make it out of the games with their lives and loved ones.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Myst-like in that it drops you in a world to figure your way through, solving puzzles to advance. A little trial and error was needed, but there is sound yet subtle logic to solving the puzzles without resorting to hints. A good pick up at $0.99, a little light on content at $2.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|best angry birds made yet! Really addicting and fun, and worth every cent!  I cant wait for the new levels to come out.
B004I744AS|5.0|it helps me because at skool we r playing a game and its like words wth friends and some of the words we don't know if it a word so i look it up and every time i did that its a word:-)
B004SUWR2C|5.0|this is the new one for kindle fire...great! please try it, it is only $.99 you will love it! get it now
B0063IH60K|5.0|great! I love it! :) Easy to use and fun. I'd reccomend it to anyone! It is awesome that it is free worth cash though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It keeps the word close and has made it easier to share the love of Jesus with others. Gods word with modern technology.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book gave me a new perspective on the military coming back home and what they are going through as they re-immerse themselves into their surroundings at home.  I'm really proud of our military and thank God that I am on this side on not the other side of our military's gun barrel.  Thank you for protecting America and allowing us to have the freedoms we have in this country!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love that you have a wide selection of games. I also like how you can save up and by the games.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|So handy.  It's so bright.  Love it!  Great add-on to my Samsung Galaxy II, Epic 4G Touch.  Also works great on my Kindle Fire.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|You know the feeling when you hear a song for the first time and know you will love it forever ? Or when you watch a movie that uplifts your spirit and touches your heart ?<br /><br />It is precious because in a sea of so so songs, movies and books, you're more often left unsatisfied than elated.<br /><br />This trilogy is a rare jewel.  It seems like a simple tale : in a post-apocalyptic world, the Capitol forces each of twelve districts to send to two teenagers to play in the hunger games, where they will  fight to the death until only one victor remains. Meant to remind the districts of the central power, the ritual sacrifice of children for the amusement of the crowd is only one measure of the Capitol's cruelty.<br /><br />As the heroine volunteers to play in the games, in order to save her twelve year old sister, her compassion, skills and resilience make her both pawn and lightning rod for the uprising of the districts. As she survives, she becomes the rock that you can not mold, to be thrown against the Capitol's buildings.<br /><br />The books convey the brutality of death and the extreme violence of the games. No sexual references but for some very light kissing. I would keep the 7-11 year old readers away because of the graphic games and war scenes. A lot of nice people give their life to the cause in these books and it might be a lot to deal with for an emotional child.<br /><br />For the rest of us, enjoy !
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series draws you into the world of those who live in the silo and there are so many twists and turns and conflicts in this book that you will not want to put it down! You will become so engaged in the different characters and their stories that you will want to unravel all of the mysteries yourself. I am also thankful that Wool 1-5 were combined into this single purchase, it made reading all of the books a breeze.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I was dissapointed that the Kindle Fire was unable to download the free app, but the $2.99 is worth it! The no gravity makes it challenging! Just when you think Angry Birds couldn't get better, it does.
B006ON41FC|5.0|in this game you are a flying squirrel. this game us very fun and addictive. I regimens it for kids but adults and play it to.
B0000041TD|4.0|First, this is an ADD recording, NOT DDD. Also, the original recording was in 1972; perhaps the CD was made from the master tape in 1990.<br /><br />At any rate, it is one of my favorite recordings of Boheme. It's well mixed and has a great sound stage, despite its age. Pavarotti cut this at a point in his career when he was in his prime. Freni is no slouch and gives one of her best performances on studio recording.<br /><br />There is a full libretto in the booklet, unlike many modern recordings.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0307592731|4.0|A great read from Cheryl Strayed that tells of her solo journey of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. I won this book from Read If Forward and I'm glad I did as it was an interesting and entertaining read that almost makes me want to hike the trail, or a part of it (just almost, I'm not that into hiking & camping). Overall Strayed does a great job of telling her story of not only the hike itself but the reason why she did the hike and how it changed her. I'd recommend this book to anyone, but especially to those who enjoy the outdoors or like to read memoirs.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is ok but some of the games are hard to play on the kindle especially the fish game
B000SX89TS|5.0|I got this download with the $5.00 Amazon gave me for my purchases.  The CD has great music on it and I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />Thank you!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Some YA books don't age well when you get older, but this one is phenomenal. A delicate, thoughtful book that is even more meaningful today. Far better than the current dystopian fantasies, because it has soul.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|I've seen True Romance a half-dozen times, and I'm not at all tired of it. Fast, funny, great dialog, awesome cast..This may be heresy, but I like it much more than Pulp Fiction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting plot, great characters, and Collins does a great job imprinting a picture of what everything should be and look like. Would love to write more but would only spoil what you MUST READ yourself.
0312641893|5.0|I have read a lot of fairy tale retellings and I can honestly say Cinder is by far my favorite which only makes me feel more stupid for almost passing up on Cinder when I first heard about the book. Cyborgs didn't really appeal to me but after reading review after review of how amazing Cinder was I picked up a copy from B&N and read it all in one sitting.<br /><br />The world was so captivating and the fact that it was set in a dystopian world filled with cyborgs, robots and otherworldly beings called Lunars made it for such a thrilling read. I would categorize it as Sci-Fi/Dystopian. The book really took off for me when Cinder's step sister Peony contracted the plague that is killing the worlds population, after that I couldn't stop turning the pages. I really liked the fact that Meyers stirred away from the two evil stepsisters and actually made one of them kind and a friend to Cinder.<br /><br />As for Cinder she is a cyborg and a mechanic I really wasn't sure how I was going to feel about her character with her being a cyborg but surprisingly I loved Cinder, she was such an amazing character to read about. I really grew to care about her and everything she went through. Also I was curious to see how the romance between Prince Kai and Cinder was going to be pulled off. The chemistry between the two is turned up high and the fact that I really adored Prince Kai helps. He is a prince soon to be Emperor but the guy is so down to earth I couldn't help but enjoy reading about him.<br /><br />Overall Meyers did a spectacular job retelling Cinderella. I mean this was just so freaking good if you haven't picked this up or it's sitting on your shelf looking pretty and you have plans on reading it one day just grab it now and start reading it. This is by far one of the best reads I've had this year so far.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I find I am using this app often and it has become an important tool for me.  I use it for journalling, creating lists for shopping, etc., taking lecture notes.  The color coding is a very useful feature that helps me organize and sort my input. I am not a whiz at learning new apps and I found this one is very easy to use.  I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I find that there is no ColorNote Notepad that I can integrate with my PC. My Kindle Fire was damaged this week and I have to wait for a replacement and meanwhile, my notes are \\"off in the cloud\\" and I am unable to use them until my new Fire arrives.  I highly recommend this app.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|got this game for my kindle fire and it was really good for the first 30 creations. Then it started crashing everytime I tried an unsuccessful match. I got this app on my son's opossum touch and have had no problems with it at all. So dissapointed with the aneroid version.
0143038419|1.0|I heard great things about this book and thought it sounded interesting so I was looking forward to reading it.  I was interested to hear the author's journey into enlightenment and self discovery.  It is intersting to me how people overcome pain and hardships. However it took me over 2 years to finally finish the book.  Why? I found it annoying and obnoxious; I would put it down out of annoyance, and then decide to try again later. I found the main character to be obnoxiously self absorbed, self centered and full of self importance.  I understand she felt she was going through a difficult time and this is her journey, but really could she be more of a whiner? If you want to read about enlightenment and self discovery through hardships and pain then try reading something else, perhpas Anne Frank or something by Viktor Frankle.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a awesome app have a blast playing it the games are challenging and so fun its a everyone must have app!
0307949486|5.0|This novel has a fast paced plot, with lots of twists and surprises, and is very deep and thought-provoking. You can trust no one and you'll never see what's coming next. I loved Lisbeth and she is unequivocally unique, plus Mikael, too, is interesting and deep. He's not your typical male journalist cum detective. Part of the beauty of the novel is that it's told from both of their exquisitely different viewpoints.<br /><br />Read slowly and savor every page!

B005VTS4EY|5.0|don't get this app unless you have time to waste!<br />loved it more than I thought I would<br />so fun
B002VX3RCW|5.0|OMG this toy is adorable!  We keep it attached to my son's car seat and he really seems to like it.  I love how every part of it is a new tactile experience for baby!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is really great. I used to play it with real mahjong set but now I can't get a group together playing this game brings me back to old times. I just love it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|the game is so addicting!!! making hundreds of elements starting from four is a great concept. it only force closed on me once and it didn't bother me.
1741798981|5.0|I would love to say I have extensively checked this guide by traveling to London but unfortunately it will be a while before that happens. After looking through the guide, however, I am impressed both with the level of detail and the easy to read writing style. I am a history buff (especially WW II) and I especially enjoyed reading about the Churchill War Rooms - something I would love to see. As another reviewer recommended, I think this guide would be best used by reading it in detail and making note of important pages or copying them to be able to reference them while on your trip.<br /><br />Overall, I am impressed with this guide and I look forward to checking it out in person some day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|theses games are really fun 2 play . I get stuck on 1 that I like and keep playing it even though there. are plenty more. they keep me woke at work I love my kindle fire!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Buying the entire trilogy was a great move, as I finished the three books during a recent airplane trip.  Very well written - you keep wanting to find out what happens next.
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|This CD is ok, but I like the \\"More Country Strong\\" soundtrack better. It actually has the actors singing the songs like in the movie.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|The thanks developers button doesn't let you come out to post review but also the finished game section says you have mini games but there is no tool bar with the additional games as it advised.  Ipretty much had to live in show 2 elements hint mode because you could combine two elements but nothing would be created then later those same elements would create a new element.  Many element combos were funny as well as logical combos, many however were not.<br />Definately a fun little game but have beaten all levels and the bonus games in one day so not sure it would be a value app but if the add ons that are promised are added would be. I'll spring for the Doodle Devil since it is only .99 and I got Doodle God free so worth it to \\"thank the developers\\" and hopefully have it be an investment in additions and upgrades to both.<br />If developers read this where are the other gamesor is that meaning the Santa, Vices/Virtue and the Save the princess games that are on main page and not on a tool bar with minigames as stated on the contests page?
B007MNV5WU|2.0|They should have a free app version of Angry birds space for for the kindle fire, and a paid version for many levels.ok.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|Of many wonderful childhood memories, I have to say that watching The Muppet Show with my parents and sisters ranks in the top five. After watching this film with my seven-year-old daughter, I got teary-eyed that she loved the same things I loved at her age--Miss Piggy's karate chops, Kermit's sweet earnestness, Fozzie's goofy jokes, Gonzo's strange chicken obsession--and that despite Jim Henson's passing, another generation of kids gets to enjoy his timeless creations.  I also got teary-eyed in the theater because I forgot HOW MUCH I loved these characters, and how much I'd missed them. It's so refreshing to see that, despite all the technology we surround ourselves with, especially our kids, some funny-looking little felt creatures can inspire our imagination and make us laugh. This will be a much-watched addition to our family movie collection.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I really do not like angry birds. It is really boring to me. No excitement, No fun. I like other apps
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun and I love it I gave it 4stares it would be 5 but some games are to to hard but other then that its all good the daily rewards are good to
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I have seem many comments about it force closing<br />I have gotten 180 different combinations and it has never forced closed! I love this game!
159102594X|5.0|I don't need to write a long, rambly review for this book; others have already done that for me. I'll just add my voice to the rest of them in telling you to GO READ THIS BOOK! Abercrombie rates up there with George R.R. Martin on my list of Really Good Fantasy, and this is only the first book in the trilogy! I'm halfway through Book 2 right now, and I can tell you, it only gets better.<br /><br />I wish I'd listened to my friends when they suggested this book to me ages ago, but I'm glad I finally picked it up at the local library. Absorbing, intricate, well-written, with excellent characters who are each unique and perfect.<br /><br />As Logen Ninefingers would say, \\"Say one thing about it, say it's a damn good read!\\"
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have always hated angry birds. I never found it fun or addictive. To be frank, I always found it STUPID! It was never fun. Then this one came out. I wanted to try it out, but didn't want to waste my money on another stupid app so I got it another way. So far, the game actually is fun. I don't find addictive like other apps though, but still, This is the only good angry birds, so get it!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good graphics. It is very similar to the pc game...easy to play, but has a lot more playing options for all skill levels. My grandmother at 75 even enjoys playing.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|my fiancee is making me wait til shes out of work to start it. ugh, Charlie brown. its ad-free so I'm sure its running fine and its birds so I'm sure its addictive enough for a 5*. if not ill update it. peace and chicken grease, ya'll.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Excellent plotting. Fair to good character development. Well edited, unlike many self-published books. Very happy I purchased this one. Highly recommended. I'm not much for writing reviews, but wanted to give this self-published author some support.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game!!! It's easy to play and hardly at all time consuming!!! Just choose a dish and go (:
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there is a nice variety of games for everyone in the house. it is easy to earn points to buy new games often.
B005VTGB0S|3.0|This case is very similar to so many that are on the market. The adjustable stand works well and the iPad 2 stays firmly tucked into the case. This will do just as good of a job protecting your tablet as similar, more expensive options.<br /><br />My only grip is the Velcro that was placed inside the elastic corner straps. They can be kind of a pain when sliding the tablet into the case and, if one didn't have a film screen protector installed, I would have to imagine that the Velcro would begin to scratch the surface of the tablet after a while.<br /><br />All in all, while I would recommend getting a film screen protector anyway, the Velcro issue is overcome by the case's overall functionality and reasonable price.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|If you love this movie, you'll love this vivid, smooth HD transfer to Blu-ray... one of the better Blu-ray movies in this series of films.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great app.  Easy to use. I did not expect the fun little home page with weather, horoscope, and word games.  I really like it.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|This is simply an awesome twist on the Vampire theme, very cool movie if you're in the mood. It's as good as the original, but In my opinion just slightly better due to the casting. The HD transfer is good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had not heard of this book or movie & actually purchased it on my Kindle by accident. I decided to read a few pages before canceling the order & I was INSTANTLY hooked.<br />I've now read all 3 books & the movie comes out tomorrow! It's all EVERYONE is talking about. If you want a story that grabs you & holds you from beginning to end...then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!!!!!
B0019N94X6|3.0|I've had a lot of recent HD, Blu-ray version letdowns and this is certainly one of them, I won't review the movie because I assume any would be buyer is already a fan, but you should check this out since it does come with the old B&W classic original. Basically many of the scenes simply look BLURRY and out of focus, it's unavoidably noticeable and made me CRINGE in agony upon seeing such scenes in the movie. To me this is an overall letdown and I don't know if they can put out a better version... maybe it's just the nature of the source material that cannot be enhanced without also enhancing original problems with those certain camera shots?
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is an awesome game. I wish they had a cheaper one, but it is worth it considering there are going to be new levels later on. This hd version has amazing graphics.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I'd never seen the extended version, it's great... the added scenes are basically those that strengthen the intimate bond that is made between the two lead characters. It plays up the \\"lolita\\" situation without being distasteful, it never goes too far. THere are a few dark scenes that look grainy, but the overall transfer to HD is pretty great. I don't review story, I leave it to people to find out for themselves.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|This is one of those books that remain very interesting, no matter how long ago it was written. Entertaining, compelling, a great book for fans of detective stories and also for those who are not acquainted with the genre, which was my case.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I was starting to get a little bored with the Angry Birds franchise, but playing with gravity adds a cool twist!  Only on level 4 but so far so good!
1594744769|4.0|The feel of the whole plot to the story seemed like something I read before.  Maybe because it was more of a first book in a series introducing characters. Even though the story was familiar in it outline there are different fantasy things happening throughout the book.  It did end in such a way that I am curious to know what will happen in it second installment.<br /><br />I read this because it was a book club pick for the Nerdfighter. To be honest I don't think I would have picked this book up any other way.  No real surprises that made me glad I read.  I don't really feel like I would have missed something if I had not read it.  Don't get me wrong it is well written I just feel attached to it.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Wow. If you are often bored with Hollywood movies, or lament yet another car chase (yawn) and yet another way of killing somebody (b-o-o-ring), and maybe you're interested in world cinema, you could do worse than to start with Pedro Almodovar, a sexually complex Spanish director who, even in his youth, managed to find unique, funny and horrifying truths, with characters who stayed with you. Now, in his prime, the genius works with longtime collaborators editor Jose Salcedo and cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine in a film produced (and co-written) by his brother, Agustin Almodovar.<br /><br />He gets an amazing performance from Antonio Banderas, who finally gets to shake off that \\"Spy Kids\\" taint and dive into dark, dark waters, making believable the unthinkable. If the director's early movies found bits of truth, this masterpiece leaves us with a heady trip wrapped around skin, gender, identity, revenge, obsession -- all those things that have defined great art through the millennia. If film is the art and literature of our generation, then Almodovar is our Picasso, our Van Gogh, our Aeschylus -- a genius trying to communicate with apes. At the same time he wallows in humanity's casual violence and thoughtless cruelty, he also manages to end on a note of hope and redemption. The characters stay with you. There are the elements of Mr. Almodovar's past films -- the hyperdrama and complex human relationships, the gorgeous eye and the outrageous stories, all compelling you to watch. Brief camera shots that take your breath away. It's Tarantino on estrogen.<br /><br />The story unfolds in the home of brilliant plastic surgeon, Roberto. He seems to be holding a beautiful woman prisoner, assisted by his devoted housekeeper and confidante, who might also be his mother. When this peaceful, if bizarre, household is invaded by an unexpected guest, new drama unfolds and we enter a long backstory where we learn who these people are and how they came together, and to this. When we return to the present day, we see that nothing is what we thought it was. In the tradition of the best films, we emerge from the viewing with a mind re-shaped by Almodovar.<br /><br />If you are ready to see what film CAN be, to have your mind twisted and your little head pumped full of big ideas, try this out. If you are already an Almodovar fan, you will absolutely love this.<br /><br />For more surreal, mind-warping films, see my Listmania List:<br /><br />[...]resent day, we see that nothing is what we thought it was.

B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game so much even my sister likes it this is one of the best game ever and It doesn't freeze in the middle of the game so that's one reason I like it if u don't like this game well tobacco because I lobed it mostly on my kindlefire

B004T2QZL8|5.0|I saw many reviews stating how the game was force closing, but I must have gotten the most recent fixed version because it ran beautifully on my EVO3d. this is the best alchemy game I've played. I love the little &quot;proverbs&quot; that it has after every element creation. the only thing I would add to the game is: vodka+human=Russian , since a Russian is quoted from vodka ;-)
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|After reading Daemon and Freedom I decided to buy them as a gift for my father.  My non-techie mother, intrigued by the Daemon name, ended up reading both in less than two weeks.  She enjoyed them so much she was bummed to have to go to work.  They weren't too technical for her yet they were technical enough for me. I hope they get turned into movies.
076790592X|5.0|This is a very short (192 pages), but engaging narrative about two people: the author Mitch Albom, and his terminally ill mentor, Professor Morrie Schwartz.  About sixteen years after his graduation from Brandeis University, Albom was moved to contact Schwartz when he saw a television program that detailed how Schwartz was dealing with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease).  Mitch promises to visit Morrie on Tuesdays (the day on which he previously attended Morrie's classes).  The book summarizes fourteen visits, which Albom treats as a graduate course on life itself.  During these visits, they discuss the world in general, self-pity, regrets, death, family, emotions, aging, money, love, marriage, culture, forgiveness, perfection and good-bye.  The student is plainly impressed by the manner in which the professor faces his fate.<br /><br />Morrie's outlook is not new; and the book does not explain the bases for his philosophy of life.  Suffice it to say that the worldly successful student is awed by the outlook of his old professor, and by Morrie's ability to deal with personal tragedy.  It brought back memories of Bob Korek, a neighborhood high school football star who died from ALS, and memories of my father confronting his final illness.<br /><br />The book is well written, albeit not in perfect conformity with the rules of grammar.  The author earns his living in the public news media.  He knows the style that attracts the public; and he writes in that style.  The reader is never in doubt as to the meaning of the author's words.  You may question his motives, but not his meaning.<br /><br />It is a very quick read.  I read it on a Tuesday.
B000E6EGXM|5.0|Britten was clearly a major artist, and when he kept it simple he often soared to great heights.  I listened again to his delightful \\"Simple Symphony\\" and wondered what wonders he might have created had he lived before Schoenberg made tonality unfashionable.  I must admit that sometimes I find his bracing, astringent, haunted, joyless vitality a wet blanket.  Is it too reactionary to suggest that among mid-century British choral composers, Gerald Finzi wrote far more loveable (and equally profound) work?  Of course, I realize that Britten created an original, if austere sonic landscape-- perhaps the closest analogy in theatre would be Samuel Beckett.  But then again, we don't wait for Godot in the home theatre every night.<br /><br />Of all the great composers, Britten is probably the one who would have benefited the most from having his kettle drums confiscated.  And Nietzsche's comment about Wagner's music being sung only by ruined voices too frequently applies in this case as well.  Perhaps I'm only reacting to certain late recordings by Peter Pears (I do recognize that Britten had an extraordinary gift for setting poetry to music).<br /><br />Bitterness, rendered into sound, is not a gift to art.  Sometimes Britten doesn't realize he's crossed a line meant to separate personal suffering from public creation.<br /><br />All this just to excuse myself for admitting that-- after owning this recording for years-- and admiring it,  I have yet to find access to it. (I'm sure it's my fault).  The \\"Ceremony of Carols,\\" on the other hand, is a personal treasure.  Jim Gomez' performance of the Four French Songs (on EMI/RATTLE CONDUCTS BRITTEN) is also lovely.
0385344228|5.0|I'm an avid reader and this book was the first in a long time that I put down and really thought about.  I agree that the father's role seemed iffy at times during the book but the entire premise of nature vs. nuture, our loyalities to our families and our communities and being forced to look at and see things we can't or won't see is highlighted profoundly in this thriller.<br /><br />While there are times during the book that it lags a little and you get mired in details you don't care as much about.  Don't put it down...keep reading and pushing.  It will pick up s quickly as it lags.<br /><br />Nothing can prepare you for the ending....a stunning read with an unexpected twist.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Supported formats?  What supported formats?  Cant play any of the most basic and common video formats, but somehow does manage to play .MOV files of all things (the lone bright spot) .  Even worse, when you try to play a video it does not support, it gets stuck in an infinite try/fail loop that you can't cancel or get out of.  I had to uninstall/reinstall the app just to get it back to its home screen.  Every time you tap a video it can't play (which is almost always), you'll have to uninstall/reinstall the app because the thing just bricks.
B00466HM28|4.0|If you need a MPC in a compact little bundle with options. I believe this to be the one you are looking for. All the options are what they say they are, the keyboard keys aren't great they could have a little more weight plus a slight more room but they  do the job. The pads are really nice feeling, sensitivity isn't fully there for lighter touch's. Two things I would remember to keep in mind are. No jog wheels, and when you get it all plugged in and the MPK MINI Editor opened. Save your four presets to your PC for backups, easy as clicking preset 1 button, save preset button, and name your save file. That's probably the only reason for me not to give it the full 5 stars no system reset. Still over all for somebody's first MPC, or that tag along in a bag. I believe theres some bang for your buck here.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I previously used the glidecam and I also owned a Steadicam Merlin for quite some time. When I saw the Opteka SteadiVid Pro I decided to give it a try... after all, at this price point there's not much to loose. The design of the Opteka SteadiVid Pro is very similar to the $800+ Steadicam Merlin. Having owned the Merlin, I expected the Opteka Stabilizer to be of much lesser quality giving that it only costs a fraction of the Merlin but it turned out I was wrong. Shipping from this Seller was fast, and I was absolutely surprised by the quality when I received it a few days ago.<br />It's actually very well built, I would say very similar to the Merlin. Almost everything is done from metal and nothing feels cheap. Like with the Merlin, the top stage has \\"micro adjustment screws\\" which is not common at this price point. This is a life saver when balancing the rig, and I wouldn't buy a stabilizer that comes without it. The set-up works exactly the same as with the Merlin, and given the fact that the Opteka only comes with very brief instruction, I would suggest to google/youtube for the merlin set-up videos. Pretty much everything applies 1 to 1 to the Opteka. It took me about 20mins to achieve perfect balance with my GH2 and I was ready to shoot.<br /><br />Results are much better than I expected from a product at that price point. I achieved almost perfectly smooth runs with it after some practicing. I really like the handle of it, it's very comfortable, and it also has a feature that the Merlin doesn't have that I started to like very quickly: There's a \\"pan grip\\" that is separated form tilt and roll. This makes it easy to pan without messing with the tilt and pan. The gimbal is very smooth, only the pan has a bit resistance, which sometimes shows up a little bit in the footage but practice should certainly help here.<br />All in all, an unbelievable value at this price point. Definitely worth the money...
B000V9D5LG|5.0|First of all, I have to thank the seller \\"ComputerGear/GoldenEye2007\\". I paid for this lens 3 days before leaving for my trip, and mentioned that to the seller. They made sure it arrived before I left for the trip! Awesome seller, great communication!<br /><br />I have to admit I'm just an amateur photographer. I like that the footprint of this lens is not much longer than the standard 18-55mm lens that came with my camera. I am sacrificing a little more of the zoom in capability, but I found that I don't seem to have a very steady hand on the long distance shots. This lens has image stabilization, so the shots came in great, both indoor ambient lighting as well as outdoor architectural shots.<br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase, and it seems to be a good balance between overall quality of the lens, construction, clarity, and quick focus functioning even at far-away objects (50+ feet).

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book was amazing.  The characters where wonderfully formed and you developed an immediate attachment to them.  The concept is not entirely original but the plot and execution of the story is absolutely masterful.  I highly recommend the first book.<br /><br />The 2nd and 3rd books leave much to be desired.<br />The author has good use of foreshadowing, which the alert reader can pretty much predict the outcomes before they happen.  I actually like this, and find it very satisfying as I read.  It allows me to feel a cretin connection with the author. Although, the only good thing out of the 2nd book is the Quarter Quell, and the only good thing from the 3rd book is the rebellion, I guess only because it had to happen, and a happy ending or even somewhat satisfying ending well forget about it.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT .............................................<br /><br />The death of one of the character closets to Katniss almost seems like the author was just mad and wanted to kill someone off.  No explanation and senseless.  If you are going to kill off the person you spent an entire trilogy protecting then at least give it some build up so the reader can digest it.  The ending is pretty much a drug educed comma of memories and delusions then exile.  The epilogue almost seems like an apology for dragging this thing out.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed this much more if it were condensed to a sequel and if the ending was more complete tying up loose ends.  Also I would like the main characters to actually have had a role in the future of Panem.  Instead they just turn into some average joe that is eventually to be forgotten. Oh well better luck next time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that I have never written a review for a book before but then again, I have never felt compelled to write a review until now. I jumped on the bandwagon after the last book of the trilogy came out and finished all three books within 3 days. The story just sucks you in that you don't want to put it down. In fact, it was so good that I had to re-read the trilogy immediately after I finished it.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there were quite a few grammatical errors that should have been caught and fixed before publishing, as well as the British references that were out of place, but the story is so compelling that it is very easy to forgive and overlook. It is definitely the best story I have read and I surely wouldn't mind reading more about Christian and Ana. As a matter of fact, I am so tempted to pick up the trilogy again for the third time.
1400069289|4.0|\\"The Power of Habit\\" is a reasonably enjoyable introduction to basic habit foundations. The author's working definition of habits involves a three-part Loop, with a Cue (the action's initiator), a habitual Routine (which may be physical or emotional), and a Reward (which \\"informs\\" your mind about a particular Loop's value).  The Loop can be changed over time, is mostly subconscious, blends past experiences and present events, interacts with other mental functions, contains social expectations, often gives a powerful sense of anticipation and craving, and can become stronger and more automatic over time (but even a single Loop can establish a solid habit).<br /><br />Perhaps the book's strongest points are the powerful and often charming stories and anecdotes used to illustrate the author's points (although he seems to generalize a bit too much from them). After describing the stories, the author discusses psychological and neurological information, and then illustrates how we can use this information to modify our habits.  Those wanting to change habits are most successful when using the conscious mind to find better Cues and Rewards, instead of beating ourselves up when we fail.  The author generally uses case studies to make points. Case studies, although appealing and often quite accurate, are among the weaker types of evidence and require your own evaluative judgment, so you need to consider the author's credibility and experience. He has been an investigative reporter for the NY Times and author of several articles apparently discussing abuses of corporate power, so use your judgment in evaluating his scientific credentials.  The book's bibliographic sources are a blend of primary-source journal articles, secondary-source books, and media articles.<br /><br />This is a complex topic, and the book seems most useful for the general reader who may not have had these concepts introduced through a formal psychology course or courses. I found it quite easy to understand and follow, although some analogies seem off the point and I noticed several plays on the emotions. Although I am not sure this will be a classic, and you shouldn't expect anything really profound, it is written interestingly enough to sell well.and and follow, although some analogies seem off the point and I noticed several plays on the emotions.

B003N7GATM|1.0|I love Reznor's recent work on \\"the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"the Social Network\\" soundtracks (with Atticus Ross), but this music is boring, cookie-cutter pop contrived to be \\"dark\\" and therefore magically \\"creative.\\"  It's not.  It's as if they're trying to be dark and tortured, but not TOO MUCH so as to appeal to a wide, popular-music audience.  And the creativity standard is in the toilet.  I mean, what went through their minds in the studio?  Something like, I imagine, \\"We need to give this song some more edge.  Where's that button that makes a sound like an evil typewriter?  Let's throw *that* in a few times!  *Then* this song will *really* be creative and dark!\\"  Yes, I'm being really mean.  But I expect more from Reznor, again, especially in light of the two aforementioned soundtracks that I really enjoy.<br /><br />I downloaded this EP free, legally, from the band's website.  I'm really glad I did this first.  I suggest you do the same, if you still can, before wasting your money.

0761169253|5.0|Creativity is an interest of mine.  Austin has captured the essence extremely well.  He makes the theory of creativity understandable through personal experiences.  His ideas are practical and spot on.  My book has now turned yellow with highlighter and I have several pages of notes.  This is an easy read that makes a great deal of sense to me.  I really enjoy his concept of \\"Steal Like An Artist\\" . . . because in becoming skilled in whatever endeavor we pursue, we do not replicate another work precisely and thus create anew!  I truly enjoyed this book.

It is full of beautiful pictures that are great reference materials, if you know what youre doing to begin with. No doubt Aucoin was a fabulous artist. People will flip whe I say this but technically (by which i mean teaching technique) the book isnt very good at all. My problem is that there is very little actual instruction. The best part of the book is the photo of his sister with the hilights and shadows, whith one side of her face blended and the other side just lines indicating the made of contour and higlight. That is invaluable. However, on almost all the looks, he gives maybe one or two of the steps it takes to create said look. Much is left out about the exact highlighting, contouring etc that has to be done in addition to the basic eyecolors and shapes to turn Liza into Marilyn for example. Still you cannot call yourself a makeup artist witthout this and face forward. But its more of a picture book than a how-to...
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I don't know why people are complaing. it works great on my kindle fire and I get updates when I have new mentions or something. plus it easy to understand. :)
0307888908|5.0|This book was so easy to read and made so much sense. It inspired me to more, smarter action to really get my start-up coaching practice going and growing with more focus and enthusiasm.Very wonderful book, Thank you to the authors!
0670022950|5.0|I have to admit that some of the assertions in Pinker's latest book made me uncomfortable at first (the concept of the 'civilizing process,' the idea that mass incarceration in the United States really has contributed to the decline in crime, to name a couple), but Pinker backs-up everything so thoroughly that I found myself utterly convinced by the end. This is the first book of his I've read, but I was amazed at how well Pinker translates extremely complex and difficult concepts for ordinary readers. Pinker brings incredible clarity to different topics without ever being reductionist.<br /><br />I feel like there's been a trend of contrarian (or revisionist, if you like) histories over the past few years, but what sets Pinker's book apart is that it does not defy conventional wisdom for the sake of standing out from the crowd. He's done his homework, and it shows.<br /><br />To offer some criticisms: I think Pinker refers back to evolutionary psychology to explain highly specialized psychological phenomena a little more than necessary, and in his comparison of catastrophic events from past time periods, I think he ends up using estimates for the death tolls (particularly for genocides of the past) that are a bit high. These criticisms are extremely minor, and I didn't think they warranted taking off a star.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|First the books were all very good.  It's a great adventure story with politics and philosophy thrown in without gratuitous sex or over the top violence.  Second the books were easy to read on my iPad using the Kindle app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome i'd rate it 1oo stars if I could ! ! !&iexcl;!!!!!!!!! ! !!! !!! !  !  !!!!! !!!! !!! ! ! ! ! !)
0226264211|1.0|Having just completed \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\", I am frankly surprised that the book has received favorable consideration and, even more alarming to me is that it has apparently been influential. I can only suspect that it has been not so much influential as \\"substantiating\\" of a sought after ideology describing the self serving economic interests of an upper class of elite wealth holders. While I differ with neoliberal ideology, ideology is arguable, what is not arguable is that Friedman's positions in this book are, to a concerning extent, established with off-point analysis, faulty logic, no logic or sadly, analysis that cannot be taken seriously. His points are, at times, simply expressed opinion or based on a \\"rough study\\" done some time back. Finally and significantly, the lack of humanity apparent in his thesis is chilling.<br /><br />While \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" is, by its significant  position in the popular political/economic literature of the last several decades, an important book, it is concerning in both its thesis and methodology.<br /><br />To borrow from Fran Leibowitz, \\"In the Soviet Union, capitalism triumphed over communism. In this country, capitalism triumphed over democracy.\\" Friedman's role in this tragic triumph was not insignificant.
B00080Z53O|4.0|Javier Bardem stars as a man in the 90s who is trapped in his body after a catastrophic  accident while diving in the sea.  He lives many years with a family who cares for him very well.  He dislikes a wheelchair and is not willing to live the life he has with his paralysis.  He goes to court and with his loved ones and help from those who support his decision is allowed to do what he choses to do.  The movie is a quiet gentle film that emphasizes the quality of life rather than the finality of death.  Nice film.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I was not dissapointed by the dvd or c.d.<br />The concert is great. i like her \\"what you see is what you get\\" approach. She sings honestly and ernestly.<br />I found her cover choices interesting. she sang them with respect. and the back-ground stories of each number are priceless.<br />I am a fan.<br />And to think my nine year old grand-daughter turned me on to her.<br />awesome.
0345444051|2.0|I can't say this is one of my favorite books by Clarke.  Although I love 2001, the book, \\"Childhood's End\\" does not quite work for me.  There are a lot of common themes in both - the evolution of man with technology, for example.  In my view 2001 handles it much more skillfully than in \\"Childhood's End.\\"  Frankly, this book has the feel of several short stories patched together.  There is no leading protagonist throughout, and many characters are introduced, and then disappear.  Jan Rodricks, who might be the main character (or perhaps Karellen?) - has a small role and doesn't appear until mid-book.  Additionally, the credit given to the paranormal seems silly, and the argument that religions would simple collapse (except for Buddhism) and people be complacently happy with the Overlords is ludicrous.  Further, why can't the Overlords evolve further?  No real explanation is given for their \\"cul-de-sac.\\"  What gives humanity the \\"right stuff\\" to leap-frog over them in terms of evolution, when so much of the book is dedicated to exposing very real human imperfection and limitations (indeed the Overlords \\"save us from our own extinction\\")?  Evolution doesn't work in such massive fits and starts, and there are just too many gaps and questions that leaves the work lacking in compelling qualities.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|In 2000, Anthony Bourdain's memoir, \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" put him on the literary, culinary map as a sharp observer of America's food culture and the restaurant business. The book features a series of loosely connected chapters on a wide range of topics like Bourdain's autobiography, details of daily life in a commercial kitchen and why you definitely want to avoid Sunday brunch at a restaurant.<br /><br />Most of the chapters in the book are tales of Chefs behaving badly. As Bourdain tells it, the kitchens of our nation are filled with liars, cheaters and psychopaths who are too depraved to find employment anywhere else. Yet from among these miscreants springs genius, commitment and passion as the best of them day in and day out create good food (and sometimes great food). Bourdain's passion for \\"honest\\" food and the restaurant business keeps this memoir from becoming a repetitive collection of anecdotes. Even his excesses and disasters come across as a desire to live life at its fullest and to sample everything that the world has to offer. \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is a love letter to food, to restaurants and the colorful cast of characters that make the magic happen.<br /><br />On a side note -- Bourdain really, REALLY hates Baltimore, a city that I spent six happy years in. Bourdain's dissing on my hometown is not enough for me to hate him, but seriously man, lay off. I find it hard to believe that it was really that difficult for Bourdain to score drugs there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this app is really fun! It has a lot of games to choose from. Helps to pass the time.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Great game with awesome graphics! Very addictive!<br />Sound effects in real time depending on where elements are located in the screen and different music for each world.<br />I love it!
1594203334|5.0|I bought the book and I cannot put it down. Pamela Druckerman has done a wonderful job at comparing and contrasting the difference in French and American cultures. I find other cultures fascinating, and this book has really educated me on France. Druckerman is hysterical - I can totally relate to her and her humor. I love her attitude going into the French concept of things - reluctant and authentic, and her ability to solidify the ways of doing things from French people who take it for granted, and explaining the fascinating and tragic history behind it all. The French way is really captivating. As a new American mom, it is nice for me to see similar attitudes and ways of doing things as the French do - like waiting (using \\"the pause\\") to see if my baby has deeper needs than a mere short-lived sleepy whine, or letting a baby experience the moment/time/space instead of cramming them with information in order to be a better baby than the one next door, or talking to them like they understand (like they are `rational' human beings). Needless to say, our baby has been \\"doing her nights\\" since she was a month and a half (well before I bought the book). I am half way through and am enjoying every second of this book. Druckerman has so far hit every concern and question that I would have raised if confronted with the same issues. She has a perfect balance between speculation and acceptance of the differences in the French and American cultures.  Love it!!!
B000002J6F|2.0|Every great writer and performer has a dud in his or her catalog and this was it for Stills.  Completely flat, forgettable and boring album here.  Far too influenced that that painfully boring Frisco tripe that Dead and Airplane fans regard as \\"GENIUS!\\" because it's cool to say that.  Stick with the CSN&Y, Stills 1 & 2 and other stuff.  Heck, even Right By You is better than this.  Also be sure to check out Stills 1975 work simply named \\"Stills\\" and \\"Illegal Stills\\".  Those are good memorable albums.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game is just trial and error, clicking on elements until they fit together.  I don't get what the game is.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I can appreciate the ease of the app and how I can keep all my memos to self in one place but can connect on any device.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Just get the free version.  This paid version has ads too and it feels cheap because of it.  Not worth the 49&cent; I paid.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The birds are hack, and once more, they are ANGRY!!  They had to travel to outer space to chase those doggone pigs.  This game is unique in that it shows directional aims, which is very helpful to me, and THIS TIME, you can create 180 degree aims.  Phenomenal!!<br /><br />I want those birds to remain angry and create more unique situations.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game looks awesome, but don't you think it should also be free? did not think of that did you?
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is by far the best Angry Birds that Rovio has made. Think a combination of Angry Birds and Super Mario Galaxy, and you have this epic beast right here. Well worth the $2.99 and buy it NOW!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is awesome I bought it this morning and already beat. I hope they add levels soon. really worth the price.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Game worked fine for a while then started force closing whenever I clicked something. hearing that there was an update, I looked again. it wouldn't update. so I tried uninstalling. when I went back to reinstall, it wouldn't let me. Guess I'm stuck playing this on a computer. (I'm on a kindle fire) .
0525478817|5.0|9th book read in 2012.    Number 19 out of 241 on my all time book list.    Follow the link below to see my video review:    [...]
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Yes, this is*shamefully admitting* my FIRST book I've read by John Green. Alas I can say it most definitely won't be the last!<br /><br />Finally I've read what everyone has been talking about. John Green's writing is awesome. Plus his vlog videos with his bro Hank are hilarious. Come on what's not to like?!?<br /><br />THE FAULT IN OUR STARS...I seriously didn't cry! LIE! Well maybe a few tears. There are some truly sad things going on in this book but I don't think Hazel or Gus would have wanted us to have a cry fest over something that can't be changed. Green has done an amazing job building up these characters to be...like real people. I didn't see Hazel or Gus as being these fragile sick teens, only known for \\"fighting a tough battle.\\" I saw them as people, living life as normal and as full as possible. They've really opened my eyes to everything. I'm grateful to have what I have.<br /><br />TFiOS is also funny too, Hazel and Gus have such great personalities. They could make a funny situation out of anything. I would have loved to literally have them in my life. And Hazel, the way she stood up for herself...for some weird reason I never would have expected it. She's an honest, tough, smart chick. And Gus stole my heart with his wit and charm.<br /><br />I really didn't want this book to end*which now I'm secretly hoping we'll meet these characters again in one form or another.* We all know how things just end...not in a way like Hazel's favorite book An Imperial Affliction. I'm just like Hazel I have some questions too, ones that really don't make sense but I want to know anyway.<br /><br />TFiOS \\"is not your average cancer book...\\" Although I am glad it didn't end in mid sentence. Hazel tells her story with full honesty and I admire her for it. I laughed, cried, laughed again then cried some more. Seriously, it's amazing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The entire trilogy of the Hunger Games was exceptional.  The Mockingjay was the best, a grand finale.  Not happy about the end-death of a cetain characters but it was a great book.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|This is a fantastic controller. Nothing negative to say about it. Feels great, good weight, and I have had no problem with the \\"dead zone' as some have. Way better than the standard Ps3 controller, sorry Sony!
B002JIEYL2|5.0|It is obvious that Sanctuary cares about the band, the music and the fans. Their remasters are incredible and also give us bonus artwork and pics. Listen to the cds with headphones, it sounds like you are in the studio as the band is laying down the tracks and every sound has it's own channel.
B0068RHGJM|1.0|I actually laugh at this album.  I didn't buy it, thank god!  This is horrible!  Listen to the samples and see for yourself.  If you want to hear a real Symphonic Metal band, check out Xandria - Neverworld's End!  That band is the real deal!  Not like these poppy idiots!
B005LJK3AC|5.0|Horrible Bosses is by far the funniest movie I've seen this year. Jennifer Aniston is hilarious and different from any other character I have ever seen her play. This amazing cast helps this already wonderful script become my favorite comedy of the year.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I just recently got addicted to Angry Birds so I was excited to play AB space! It's awesome! I love the gravity gameplay. So worth $2.99
0790729709|4.0|Although it took a bit long to arrive but it was well received at last and in good quality.  DVD was sealed tight and I'm happy with it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|good book, great price for ebook. Bought it for my iPad through the kindle app, and never had any problems.
B005LAIGFU|3.0|Tilda Swinton is stripped of her exotic androgyny as the guilt-ridden mother,Eva, who gloried in her formerly independent state of freewheeling travel and love of Franklin her husband.The book and film dealt with a taboo: what if a mother doesn't like her son or can't bond with him?Debate centred upon maternal ambivalence and bad parenting.What if a child felt unwanted, would his lack of love be turned into a weapon of manipulative psychopathy?Pregnancy doesn't kickstart the milk of human kindness.The parents are dishonest in their dealings with Kevin's bad behaviour,lack of empathy and subtle malevolence.Eva puts up with his negative behavoiur and never really confronts him,even though she knows she should.Franklin(JC Reilly) buries his head in the sand,pretends everything is hunky-dory,overcompensating for Eva's lack of affection for Kevin. Kevin levers himself between the two of them and exposes their weakness.Kevin is no Damien:he's both arrogant and cruel to mother and sister,disrespects but loves his dad,but he's also vulnerable, though he's the context of vast cunning and manipulative evil.Kevin has picked up from a very young age he is the cause of his mother's loss of freedom,so he is perfectly capable of talking but she thinks he intentionally holds back on his language development out of spite as he doesn't want to please her. Similarly, she thinks he is perfectly capable of bowel control and toilet training, but until the age of 6 he is still in nappies, making her life intentionally as awkward as possible.<br /><br />Of course due to the problems of running time and the slashing of the budget,Ramsay has had to concertina the story in a flashback structure(we leave out the epistolary nature of the novel)stripping down the literary conceit,giving us a delayed reveal through net curtains veiling the worst of Kevin's misdemeanours. We get the splintering of time,the symbolism of imagery with the colour red, tomatoes,paint,soup cans,to immerse you in the tormented, fragmented memories of the woman who is depicted as the victim,nailed teeth-grindingly and reluctantly to motherhood,and the monstrous nature of her evolving son. Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller are brilliant younger and older Kevins.This is not treated as an issue film,we are given the subjective view of Eva looking back and asking what went wrong from Kevin's conception to his murders,in the story of her family. Eva instantly feels a connection with her daughter in a way she never did for Kevin. Whether that makes him jealous or whatever, he always uses her to torment Eva further. Once her daughter loses her eye (because of Kevin or not, who knows) then Kevin constantly picks on her about it. Swinton plays her part superbly well,one of anxiety,coldness and tension. The cinematography and sound design are beautiful as is the editing, just excellent. However where the film falls down is perhaps in the plot and execution of story. We're left almost wondering what the entire purpose of the film was,it's an impressionistic rendition of a mother's experience and the nature of her unconditional love for a confused, complex,damaged and disturbed child.Brave but ultimately flawed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|please remove the ads<br />and I love the games<br />there is one thing I hate about it and it it the advertisements...<br />it bothers me whenever I play
B002R5QPRI|5.0|the movie was great!whitney houston and kevin costner was a good match playing these roles in the movie.a timeless classic,that will not be forgotten ever!
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Michelle did an excellent job portraying Marilyn in this movie. I would highly recommend this movie for any Monroe fan!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It sure is a winning album. You will enjoy all tracks with nothing to spare. Adele has such a given one of a kind voice and was saved for as to enjoy listenning.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|I bought two of these bags - one to work with a point and shoot camera - and one to work with a webcam to keep it safe while travelling.  It worked great for both of these purposes!<br /><br />The bag was a little larger than my camera, so left plenty of room for the extra batteries and memory cards that also needed carried.  The front velcro clasp closed securely and I never had any problems with anything falling out of the bag.  It was constantly moved from the suitcase to a laptop case to a purse and back and protected the camera securely the entire time ... but was also very easy to access and allowed me to quickly reach and use the camera when needed.  I did not use the belt loop to attach the bag to a belt, but did use it to attach to a bag a few times and it worked perfectly.<br />The bag was also very useful as a protective case for a webcam; we have an HD webcam that we didn't want to get scratched up on a recent trip.<br /><br />This case worked great - the cam went into the \\"camera\\" portion of the case and the cord was closed up in the front pocket.  Everything was securely fastened and nothing got scratched or damaged in transit!  This was also moved from suitcase to laptop bag and back again several times and was fully protected and safe the entire time.<br /><br />All in all, a great little camera bag at a great price!  There aren't many bells and whistles on this bag, but if you're looking for a basic camera bag useful to protect your camera (or webcam º), this is your bag!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Epic and is the awsomeest off all the games a could play all day love the gravity makes things cooler buy this one now!
B004P12SSW|5.0|Never saw a musical like Burlesque before. The only one that I would watch over and overagain. Don't understand why it did not do well in the movies because what I saw was absolute outstanding. Movies like Burlesque needs a folloup movie. THAT IS JUST MY OPINION...
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Have used this several times to date. It works very well - I found that it is better to attach the adapter after starting your iPad, as on one occasion I did the reverse and the iPad didn't recognize it as an original accessory. So far, so good.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I've played every paid version of Angry Birds, and as much as I've enjoyed playing AB, it was getting more and more difficult for Rovio to come up with new versions that weren't just cosmetically different. Okay, Rio was different, but that was more than a year ago. Now we have Angry Birds Space, and I love it. Having to figure orbital trajectories and the effects of gravitational fields has made it a completely new kind of challenge. I've even noticed that in some levels, birds can get stuck in Lagrange Points (these should be familiar to sci-fi fans).<br /><br />With its 7-inch screen, the Kindle Fire is a great platform for Angry Birds.<br /><br />Update (June 21, 2012): More levels and new birds have been added to ABS since the original was released a few months ago. Now, additional features like popcorn (yes, popcorn!) have been included, making the game even more challenging.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I downloaded this app just before we had severe weather recently and checked it frequently to keep track of the storms. It was perfect!
B005Q78IPG|3.0|When I first started to read this I was put off by the way it has been deliberately written in bad English. However once I got to grips with this and realised it was really a necessary and integral part of the novel I began to enjoy it much more, finding it both witty and charming.<br /><br />Zhuang is twenty three years old and her parents have sent her to spend a year in London to learn English to enable her to return to China and help them expand their shoe factory business. The bad English grammar of the writing is essential as at first this is is how she communicates with no understanding of tenses or verbs, just armed with a dictionary. In fact it reminded me of when I first moved to Italy, completely out of my depth with the language.<br /><br />It is a very poignant story as Zhuang coming from an Eastern culture to a Western one seems very naive of the ways of the new world she is now inhabiting. Unfortunately the older hippy that she meets, befriends and very quickly ends up living with is far from a perfect partner for her. His attitudes towards her, sex and life in general mean that learning about love is even more confusing for her than learning the language. I should maybe also point out here that are are a few scenes in this novel that are sexually explicit.<br />As Zhuang's grasp of the English language becomes stronger she starts to question the attitude of her lover suspecting that her values are very different to his. The relationship is heading nowhere, although she has a strong desire for this not to be the case.<br /><br />A sad but believable story about a young girls loss of innocence as East meets West.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|love this game and very glad they updated it so it doesn't force close anymore and that they did it quickly:) almost created everything
B0062NAX1U|5.0|[[ASIN:B0062NAX1U Courageous]]If I could give this movie more than 5 stars, I would! It's outstanding...I've watched it several times over alone and with my friends. We loved it! This is truly one of the finest Christian oriented films I've ever seen. It's so rich and full of depth, I don't know where to begin. I'm sold on Alex Kendrick's movies. He rocks!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If I get a new phone or tablet one of the first things I do is, go to the app store on my new devise and find that Big Redish Brown Bible Icon and down load it. May God bless all who is involved for all the time, effort &amp; love that has been spent developing this Great App.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|great game love the design final fells like a sequel great graphics stay great angry birds all the birds look

B004T2QZL8|2.0|I installed and started playing.  Everything was fine for 10 minutes and then it froze when trying to combine 2 elements.  I've tried it several times since that day and it still won't work. It is a fun game and looks good.  I will give 5 stars when it gets updated.
B004XIVQ7Q|5.0|We first read Sarum in 1989 just before visiting Salisbury, Stonehenge, Woodhenge and Sarum itself, while on a trip from our homeland, New Zealand. The novel, based on careful historical research, provided an excellent background and it was not difficult to visualise the characters, places and events when we were \\"on the spot.\\" Rutherfurd's technique to cover a vast swathe of history in quite gripping \\"bites,\\" which all coalesce into a co-ordinated whole, was well chosen and has served him well in all his later books. My second reading of Sarum, this time the Kindle edition, was just as enjoyable, possible a little more, than the first. Maybe the three visits we've had to Wiltshire since that first reading have contributed to this. Highly recommended.
B00005MP58|5.0|After wearing out 2 sets of VHS tapes I broke down and purchased the DVD. What a treat. The clarity of picture lost in the VHS recordings is phenomenal. The detail in the fabrics, sets and design give me new appreciation for the work which went into the production. Clarity in dialogue previously muffled lent more understanding also. A must have for P&P fans.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I give these books 5 stars!!! One of the best romance books I've ever read! Other reviews said it all,  and not gonna reaiterate. So addicting! Hope and pray they continue to write Christian's version!!! I would love to read all of of it!!! Oh MR GREY!!!

B000RIWAVW|5.0|I like this scary movie as longs as some one is watching it with me.  I'm not really in to watching scary movies and it is a okay movie.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the number one...the best military book I have ever read.  It is a true life edge of your seat thriller.  It is a truly miraculous story that is so inspiring.  I give this the highest recommendation possible.  It is truly amazing!

B000GOZ0ZK|5.0|I love this movie too I love the ocean and Sharks, this keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B006ISJQ26|5.0|read some poor reviews but I'm quite pleased to disagree.  Monahan changed Bruen's story and in so doing gave us two great characters played superbly by Farrell and Ray Winstone.  Best performances for each in some time.  The relationship between these two is the centerpiece.  The music tracks were criticized but I found them to be an excellaent fit and backdrop.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|This is my favorite movie  I loved this movie as a teenager.  Kevin Bacon is great in this movie and I love the music.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I will say that this film is one of the best Disney has come out with. I recently introduced the film to my husband (who had not seen it when it was released in theaters), who has always been a little skeptical of these kind of films.<br /><br />HE LOVED IT. I think its something anyone can share and enjoy.
B000F8O35U|1.0|received first copy...didnt play correctly....returned it and received another  same problem, only worse.  plays slowly and stops at certain points during movie
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I'm always looking for a great buy and when I saw this I bought it . Its a roller coaster ride all the way through that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through..
B005VTS4EY|4.0|So far I have had great fun with this game. It is simple looking yet causes you to think.. A little, not too much to be annoying.  Excellent for killing time.
1594203334|5.0|I wasn't disappointed in this book, even with all the hype Druckerman got at publication time.<br />I hope it starts a rethinking of our American child-rearing ways<br />and why they hurt not only parents but also the kindergarchy.<br /><br />An American grandmother
B006M4F67A|4.0|This version. Was easy to download and update. Every once in awhile it will freeze up and I must force it to close. But overall I enjoy this one
B000FA5TTW|5.0|i dont have this book but i read the sample and its really good they should lower the price to make it more affrodable for most people

0525478817|5.0|This is a very inspiring story. a must read for teens and adults alike.  I would recommend buying a copy and reading it for yourself
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am reeling from this series. I read it in a whirlwind over the past few days, and will read it again to savor it, but not just now. I need time to digest.<br /><br />The story jumps and twists in sometimes agonizing ways, leaving characters in perilous conditions while knitting up some other strand of the plot, growing slowly into a master work. I have read few books which treat the tension between self determination and the good of a society, and the roles of individuals at varying levels of social responsibility in shaping the social order, without trying to reduce complex problems to simple answers. This author is not afraid of letting the ambiguity develop, and fully fleshing out all sides of the discourse before resolving the plot tension in clever and unexpected ways.<br /><br />Well done. So very well done. I am on to another title by this author, and will read all he puts out.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Very good app but does not rotate in kindle fire which is important and basic. Should be corrected soon. Longer forecast would be good.
B0079ZWGVU|4.0|In case you haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, I tried hard not to spoil anything in my review.<br /><br />I have seen the movie before I read the book. This is a good read. There are terrific ideas in there and the style rivets attention from the first page to the last. I'm not a native speaker so at times it was quite a challenge to get the meaning from the fragmentary sentences or cultural references. That might somewhat impact my view of the work.<br /><br />If the book reads like typical prose, the movie is like a poem. Says far less but tells so much more.<br /><br />It has to be said that the main character in the book is quite different from the Driver in the film adaptation. The story is as well but the divergence between the protagonists struck me most. I feel as if after reading the story I know more facts about the book's Driver but at the same time I know much less about the person inside. It was also a slight let-down to see Sallis literally call the main character \\"Driver\\" throughout the book. You'd think he would find a way to hide the hero's name without resorting to a placeholder.<br /><br />I have to admit I fell in love with the movie. It has a unique feel to it, visibly takes inspiration from 70ties and 80ties flicks. I was even caught saying it's like a modern variant of the \\"Taxi Driver\\" theme. It sure feels like it is. Both strive to be minimal in terms of dialogue and superfluous backstories, and through uncompromising bloat cuts their authors achieved unmatched Quality.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this book if only to see how Gosling, Amini & Refn made a masterpiece out of a decent noir story.
0880796863|2.0|How disappointing that they would go through so much trouble to put together such an appealing package of book, box, and cards and then do such a bad print job.  The colors are not true to the original.  Half of the brilliance of this artist's work were her choice of colors.
0385528752|5.0|Heard and enjoyed SWITCH: HOW TO CHANGE THINGS WHEN CHANGE IS HARD (Random House Audio), written by Chip Heath & Dan Heath and narrated by Charles Kahlenberg.<br /><br />The authors answer the question: Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our communities and in our lives? The primary obstacle is a conflict that's built into our brains, which are controlled by two different systems--the rational mind and the emotional mind. But if we can overcome this tension, then change can come quickly.<br /><br />For example, they start off the book with a fascinating study about moviegoers who are given stale popcorn. it seems that people eat more popcorn when you give them a bigger bucket. Period. So if you want them to eat less popcorn, just give them smaller buckets. You don't have to spend all sorts of time trying to influence their motivation or understanding.<br /><br />Then they discuss an alarm clock called the Clock that has wheels. You set it at night and when it goes off in the morning, it rolls off the nightstand and forces you to chase it down. Our rational side in this instances wants to get up at 5:45 a.m., but our emotional side wants nothing more but to stay inside a warm cocoon of sheets to get a few more minutes of sleep.<br /><br />The book presents many other examples, taken from a wide variety of situations. The bottom line is presented through the analogy of an Elephant and his Rider. The Rider is your logical brain. The Elephant is your heart. If you want the elephant to move, you need to engage both the Rider and the Elephant. Or if you want to change behavior, you must direct the Rider (by providing clear direction), motivate the elephant (by engaging emotions) and shape the Path (by creating the best environment).<br /><br />SWITCH is a fine book to read for any individual or organization going through change--or contemplating that possibility.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|\\"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\\"<br /><br />This verse of Scripture from the book of Job opens Terrence Malick's latest masterpiece, entitled The Tree of Life. After these words appear over a black screen and fade out into the darkness, a mysterious flame illuminates the center of the screen, followed by a distant voice which breaks the silence - \\"Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to Your door.\\"<br /><br />Thus begins the most beautiful and complex film that you are likely to see this decade. It is not a film in the traditional sense of the word. This is not a plot-driven film. What we have here is the journey of life in words and images - a prayer to God which questions His motives, which longs to understand Him, which calls upon Him, and yearns to be near Him at all times.<br /><br />The film follows Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) on the anniversary of his younger brother's death. Jack, a skilled architect, is disillusioned with the world around him. \\"The world has gone to the dogs\\", Jack ponders, as he stares blankly out of the window of a high-rise building. Jack leaves his office and prays to God - \\"When did you first touch my heart?\\" Almost immediately, we are whisked back and forth, through past, present, and beyond, to the creation of the galaxies and the Earth, to the brief reign of the dinosaurs, and the beginning of human existence, until, finally, we reach \\"the end of time\\".<br /><br />Throughout the film, we revisit Jack's tormented childhood in rural Texas in the 1950s. We are introduced to his family, led by his parents (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain). His angelic mother teaches Jack and his two brothers the ways of grace (love, forgiveness), while his father represents the way of nature (selfishness, greed). These conflicting worldviews serve as a catalyst for Jack's spiritual and existential struggle, which drives the second act of the film.<br/><br />Mind you, this synopsis does the film no justice. This film cannot be defined in simplistic terms, nor can it be categorized into any specific genre of film. This is a film that defies convention. It redefines the way that we experience cinema. It is alive, full of wonder and awe. It is poetry. As a friend of mine said after the first screening, this film is a force. It will be a different experience for each individual. You will get out of this film exactly what you bring to it. For me, it is quite possibly the most spiritually significant experience that I have ever had in a theatre. It allowed me to see God portrayed in a way that is respectful, unique and all-encompassing. The grace and mercy of God saturates every frame of this film. Every element - from the beautiful and haunting imagery, to the ethereal soundtrack, to the understated performances, to the philosophical musings on existence - works together in perfect harmony to create a work of art that you will never forget. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the direction from Terrence Malick is as perfect as ever. Not since Bergman has an artist tackled these complicated themes with such respect and originality.<br /><br />This is the best film that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for thematic elements. 139 minutes. ***** out of ***** Fox Searchlight Pictures. Directed by Terrence Malick.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this only because of the buzz the book has been getting. I found it very hard to stop reading. I was up until 1 am on Monday night just because I had to finish and immediately bought the second book.<br /><br />So no matter what the buzz is the book is not all about BDSM. Yes there are some elements of this in the books but it's not the basis. There truly is a love story in this and it drew me into it. I can't wait to find out more about Christian.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I decided to take a chance on my first ebook purchase with this book series based on a review I read in a magazine.  I ended up returning all three books-for reasons other than the story itself-and have chosen not to repurchase them in paperback form.  I did enjoy the story itself though I would have to agree with others comments reguarding too many references to her inner goddess.  I also could not understand the continuous use of the word murmur.  Doesn't anyone just say something in a normal tone?  I found myself skimming through large parts of the dialouge for these reasons alone.  I kept waiting for the contract to be settled and for things to really start taking an interesting turn.  By about 90% of the book it still had not been finished and my interest began to wane.  I will most likely wait until I can pick these up at a library or a used book store.  Don't hate it but don't LOVE it either-so so.

I have already read this series three times and I still am enjoying it to the utmost, With all the twists, deception, betrayal, humor, and action packed adventure, I don't think you will want to put this book down when you start to read it.

B003O86FMW|5.0|While the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy I found this book to be as equally engaging as the first. Here we start to see the love triangle slowly emerge however what made this book great was that the love story was really a secondary element to the story plot. If you were a fan of the first one...I recommend this one.
B004QL7K8E|1.0|I went into this movie based on strong word of mouth about how good it was and I regret spending my time and money on it. It was basically an hour and twenty minutes of unlikeable losers doing a lot of idiotic things and trying to get lucky. The main character named Costa was the most detestable person on the planet, I seriously wanted to dropkick him in the face the entire movie. The only reason why I didn't walk out was because I was hoping that he would get what he deserved in the end. I'd rather watch \\"The Devil Inside\\" a hundred times over than this piece of **** ever again. Avoid like the plague.

1741798981|3.0|This travel guide was a little disappointing to me.<br />I was hoping for a more illustrated guide and this book hasn't got many photographs as compared to other brands of travel guides.<br />The paper is very poor quality and cheapens the book.<br />The book does compensate with many maps at the end and also a big, pull-out map.<br />It also does cover top attractions for tourists, a little history, nightlife and climate, hotels,restaurants, etc. Still, I think a much better job could have been done with it.<br />It is a good read and will give you ideas, but I would have liked more specifics.<br />In my view, this guide really falls short of being very informative and useful.
0142000655|2.0|Giving this a 2 star because that is to mean \\"I did not like it\\" -- does not mean to report anything about what literary value this novel might have to others.<br /><br />I found this lengthy novel filled with cardboard characters, drawn in broad strokes, nothing nuanced or believable.  The narrative voice did not appeal to me, at most times it was omniscient, seeing all that a particular character saw, thought and did.  Then, randomly, a first person in the form of a cousin of some of the characters, dropped in and assumed the role of storyteller, only to disappear in short order.  This provoked a skeptism of the narrative voice, which was difficult to overcome.  Especially given that the narrative voice was repetitive, drawn to long passages of dialogue that seemed not at all like dialogue but more like lectures.  And totally devoid of humor, wit or self-deprecation of any sort.  Story teller took himself far too seriously, in my opinion.<br /><br />Plot was primarily a repetition of symbol after symbol, good vs evil, self torment unbounded.  One driving issue for Steinbeck seeming to revolve around the translation of a verb included in one of the texts included in Old Testament.  Great deal of weight given to whether the verb might give man the option of determining his own destiny, as opposed to the \\"Presbyterian\\" idea of pre-determination.  So if you think you would like to spend 600 pages on this issue, and if you believe understanding man's destiny hinges on this translated verb from an ancient writer's text, then this is your book, I suppose.
0385512058|3.0|The book followed the 80/20 principle. 80% of the common observations and 20% of valuable nuggets. If you are an alive, breathing and social human being then you should know that networking is a very powerful tool. However, networking by itself is not the goal, it is to improve yourself to the level and build a personality that attracts people. That 20% of the book is extremely valuable because it gives you the fundamentals of being a successful net worker i.e. build your core competencies, be excellent at something, be passionate, be articulate and be opinionated. That \\"networking\\" is a \\"process\\" which requires specific skills. Just like everything in the world, the skills can be learnt if one focuses on them and continues to work on the process.<br /><br />In my opinion Keith thought of his relationships as a tool in the capitalist economy to move up the value chain. At various places he did mention that he does not think of it as a give and take game, where you are calculating your every move. But it seemed from his over all narrative about relationships, that this is exactly what he thought. He did not want you to micromanage those relationship but think at the macro level and that everything that you build will pay off. It is a very narcissistic and capitalistic view of relationships, and I wonder if he can truly call any of those people his friends. Those that would do something for him even if he didn't have any social capital.<br /><br />Lastly, the story of Keith Ferrazi to me is a bit of a fake. In the brand lusting american society, Keith had two of the strongest brands to his name. Yale undergraduate and Harvard Business School. The big question is, if he took those away from him, would he still be able to build the relationships and the social capital that he has today. In my experience, coming from a fairly humble background and state schools, those tricks and trips rarely bear as much fruit as they did for him.

B0073PZIYI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie! I thought it was predictable and that the acting in it was great, however I wanted there to be more Time for the actors to come together and the ending left me feeling a bit Flat! I think they had a real great concept and could have taken it in so many directions that it went flat at the ending, and of course they left it open ended for the opportunity for another Just in time! Even with all that I found that needed fixing I really did enjoy it a lot!
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 is a masterpiece!!! Well, another masterpiece by the heavy metal progressive gods of RUSH!!! By this time, RUSH was very HEAVY oriented...There´s no time for pop influences on 2112...Some acoustic songs to remind Led Zeppelin, the great A PASSAGE TO BANGKOC and TWILIGHT ZONE...And the monster EPIC 20 minutes trip of the song 2112!!!!This is one of the coolest songs of all time!!! It takes almost half hour of your day, but it´s so fantastic that you will want more, for sure...then you can listen to HEMISPHERES, A FAREWELL TO KINGS or CARESS OF STEEL...

0062119044|1.0|Let me just start off by saying, the writer does have talent (I am not arguing that). However, the book lacks depth and believability. I am not sure if this book was written to be a farce (humor) or if the author is so removed you are supposed to be disgusted. What I felt was basically nothing. No child is born completely evil. It just does not happen. Some may be prone to \\"the dark side\\" but it's the parents who shape a child.<br /><br />In this book, Kevin is basically the Anti Christ from the moment he comes out of the womb. Maybe the book would have been more successful had it been made into a psychological thriller (Rosemary's baby) type thing. Also we are made to hate every single character in the book. The mother is shallow and removed. The father is an idiot. Kevin is the bad seed. His sister is a weakling. So how can you read a book that 1) you don't believe and 2) you hate all the characters?? The main character Eva is also so uppity, shallow and narcissistic, I believe the book would have been written a little better if it was NOT written in letter format. I hate books written in letter format!<br /><br />This also would have garnered more stars if we could hear Kevin's side--because I sure don't believe the innocence nor do I find it funny how Eva \\"the good mother\\" interacted with her son.

0545265355|5.0|First off, I am not normally one to write reviews of stories here on Amazon. It has to be truly horrific, in which case I'm usually venting at having wasted hard earned money on dreck, or overflowing with praise. In this case, it is the latter, I was quite sceptical when \\"the Hunger Games\\" initially came out, I rarely venture into the young adult section, few of the books I have read from that classification have truly given me any pleasure (Harry Potter is an exception). The constant comparisons to the \\"Twilight\\" series (I read about 3 pages before deciding it had no literary merit whatsoever)was a serious deterent.<br /><br />That being said, I was stunned, amazed, my attention could not be taken away from this series. I actually called in sick to work in order to finish \\"the Mokingjay.\\" It took me about three days to finish the trilogy, my appetite for what will happen next being totally insatiable. I loved this series. I loved its darkness, its characters (even the antagonists). I loved the theme, the morals, everything... I am not one who says that often.<br /><br />As someone who reads hungrily when the story is truly excellent, relishing ever word, I was glad I waited to read it until the entire trilogy was completed, I don't know if I could have tolerated the suspense of waiting years for the next installment. The author's portrayal of post apocalyptic America is intensely real and filled with horrors that should give modern Americans pause. The underlying sentiments and morals in the story are both eye opening and heart wrenching. The imigery is fantistic. The pain the characters feel becomes your pain. I was truly taken up into the world of Panem and felt Katniss to be a kindred spirit. The darkness of this tale outweighs that of some actual intentional horror stories I've read. Suzanne Collins could give H.P Lovecraft a run for his money in terms of nightmare inducing terror. This tale leaves one haunted and moved by the experiences of its characters, begging for more. Amazing, simply a masterpiece. I loved it. What more can one say?ging for more. Amazing, simply a masterpiece. I loved it. What more can one say?

0316056863|4.0|I'll keep this short and sweet...I really liked this book!! Tina Fey obviously has a gift for comedy that shines through in her writing (and the picture on the cover - still can't get over it!!). Overall the book tended to be a little disjointed, but her writing style made up for the lacking joints.<br /><br />I especially loved the chapter in which she described the birth of \\"30 Rock\\". You can really tell that she put her heart and soul into creating this show, and despite all the jokes (and some of the lines from the show, which are A-MA-ZING), you can undoubtedly feel her passion. I also really want to meet Donald Glover one day.
0446343129|5.0|The thing I found most fascinating about reading this book was the historical background it gave me on the subject of sugar in general.  Reading more like a crime drama than a health manual, I was surprised to recognize over and over again the parallel's between sugar's sordid history and other \\"big lie\\" cultural scourges.<br /><br />And yes, today I'm 59 days clean.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Ok, no joke...World War Z was the best book I've read this year. I know, I know...zombies? But seriously, drop everything you are doing (after finishing this, because it's amazing) and go out and buy (or steal if you get really desperate) a copy of this book. You can thank me later.<br /><br />While World War Z includes some specific digs on, among others, the big pharma industry and  the US govt, the overall commentary revolves around human nature - how people react in the face of a huge crisis. I really think that some of the responses people have to zombies can be applied to almost any big crisis that we may face - superstition, selfishness, and occasionally, when there seems to be no hope whatsoever, compassion - when you get right down to it, humans really are an interesting breed.<br /><br />I think the thing I enjoyed most about reading this novel was that I was able to just sit back and let the writing suck me in. World War Z was INCREDIBLY realistic. Max Brooks is either an extremely skilled writer, or did a boatload of research (or both) because I honestly felt like I was reading a history book (a really really interesting awesome amazing creative history book). I was transported around the world and was absolutely devastated by the destruction that resulted from the war...and then I had to tell myself, \\"Self, don't get so upset...you're just reading a book\\". Then I would turn off all my lights and suspiciously peer through my blinds to make sure none of my neighbors had turned into zombies...you really never can be too careful.
1609419693|5.0|Wow!! I finished this audiobook in just two days.  It was so hysterical, that I listened to it not only during my commute, but also while cooking dinner because I just couldn't hit pause.  First of all, it's read by Tina which means you don't have to guess what the author's tone would be...she's the one reading!  Second, the way she reads is very fast-paced.  There is no section that drags.  Third, she acknowledges that you are listening to an audiobook which is quite fun.  **Warning: If you are listening to this on an MP3 or CD player in public, you will receive strange looks when (not if, when) you laugh out loud.**
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I've realized that there are three things that make me love a book...I definitely need all three, but there is a clear hierarchy of importance: characters, plot, writing style. And Markus Zusak displayed a wonderful use of all three in The Book Thief.<br /><br />Characterwise, Zusak made an interesting choice when he decided to use Death as the narrator of this book. He did a great job of making it seem like Death was just carrying on a conversation - almost like we were old friends. I also really loved the male-female relationships throughout the book. The main character's relationship with her foster father is absolutely heart-wrenching. I can't even really put into words how I felt when reading about their interactions. Just overall amazing-ness.<br /><br />The plot was also very interesting. There were several unexpected twists and turns, which kept The Book Thief from becoming just another fictional WWII story. I find that I'm often drawn to these types of books (another goody is Sarah's Key), so it fit right up my alley.<br /><br />In addition to all this, I really liked Zusak's writing style! He displayed an amazing sense of the power of adjectives, especially in using color to describe typically non-colorful things, such as emotions and words. For the most part, his writing style was what I would describe as \\"casual\\". I think Zusak understood that he had an great novel on his hands and didn't let unnecessarily fancy writing get in the way of the story.
B000KIPT30|5.0|So I bought this headphone amp about a year ago and I can say its prity well made and nice to have when working with alot of audio equipment. Alot of the time I have it hooked up to my computer becouse it gives me realy quick controll of the volume going to my speakers or headphones. It Gives me 4 outputes, all with there own volume controls. Its case is made of metal so its pritty rugged. The sound is graet, I never even have to max out the volume on it. I never seem to lose any sound quality. It uses 1/4\\" stereo jacks, wich is no problem for me cus I always use my vintage headphones. I ordered converters for other headphones and audio equipment I sometimes use. I would prob advise using some velcro if you are going to have it in one spot all the time cus it slides easly. Its nice and small but has to be plugged into the wall so you cant realy use it on the go. Over all it was well worth the money.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|I found myself on Sunday afternoon in a cute little park ireading One Day. After managing to tune out the dogs barking and babies crying, I started to read...and read, and read, and read. And then about 200 pages later, I came up for air. It wasn't so much that I couldn't put the book down, but rather that I felt genuine concern for the well-being of the two main characters, Emma and Dex. That, and it was pretty easy reading.<br /><br />I think some of my favorite parts in One Day were the character descriptions. Dex's mom is described as an \\"immaculate mess\\" - what an amazing use of words! I keep thinking of a slightly disheveled business woman at the end of a long day - pencil skirt askew, once perfect updo coming slightly undone...maybe a broken high heel? Definitely a big glass of wine - you get the point. At another part, Emma says, in describing Dex, \\"Complicated. You're like a two piece jigsaw - in thick ply.\\" Again, Nicholls proves to be a master with words in describing an entirely uncomplicated someone.<br /><br />I wouldn't classify this as \\"chick lit\\", but it was surely no Atlas Shrugged. You see, I never laughed, but it was amusing, and I never cried, but it was quite tragic. I had such high hopes for One Day, however it just didn't seem to live up to it's full potential. I fell in love with the general concept of this book. I found the idea of looking at two people's relationship through a one-day snapshot over the course of 20 years to be pretty intriguing. I did like that we weren't forced to sit through countless \\"ironic\\" scenes where the characters miss each other. A lovesick man arrives in London, just in time to realize that his potential soul mate has left London to find him at his home back in LA. Instead of these physical misses, the characters tend to mentally, or rather emotionally, miss each other. They are constantly occupying such different mindsets throughout the book, that although my ultra-romantic and girly side (that I am somewhat mortified about) wanted them to work out, I felt as though there was just no hope for them. Wishing for the best, but fearing the worst - a bit frustrating, but it definitely kept me reading!rtified about) wanted them to work out, I felt as though there was just no hope for them.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a good second book.  I was ready to start reading it as soon as I was finished with the first book.
0143120530|4.0|I'm not really much of a non-fiction person, but I really enjoyed reading Moonwalking with Einstein! It turned out to be a total underdog story, which I loved, and it took all my self control not to stand up and cheer after reading the chapter where Joshua wins the U.S. Memory Championship!<br /><br />My favorite parts were the little memory games I could follow along with. I loved the tricks that the author described for memorizing to-do lists, and found that they really worked! I was able to memorize 15 random items on a \\"to-do\\" list by picturing the items somewhat obscured around my mom's house: Ryan Gosling sitting in a tub of cottage cheese (how could I ever forget that one??), a man snorkeling in my mom's living room, a giant elk eating a sausage at the top of the stairs, and myself repelling off my bedroom balcony. I was amazed that by using these techniques, I could not only remember the list immediately after reading the section, but also later that night, and even now, almost a week later.<br /><br />Moonwalking with Einstein also touches on a variety of different topics related to memory that would be useful in our everyday lives: the importance of immediate feedback vs delayed feedback, and the value of practicing what is difficult vs what you have already mastered (which sounds so redundant, but judging from my own experience, I have always been more fond of practicing the easy stuff because it is more enjoyable to do so. Even now, I would much rather cook chicken parm than a filet mignon because it's easier - even though the payoff could possibly be better with the filet). Although these are things that I already know, the author describes them in ways that really resonated with me.<br /><br />The general theme that appears over and over is that we have entered an age in which we don't really need to remember anything. There was a statistic in the book saying that 30% of British people under the age of 30 can't even remember their home phone number without looking it up!! We have so much technology at our fingertips these days that there is no real need for us to remember phone numbers, birthdays, schedules, etc. And as amazing as technology is (where would I be without my 2000 Facebook photos to remember the past 8 years of my life???), it's kind of sad to think that it's essentially replacing our need to remember.hout looking it up!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last book of the Hunger Games trilogy was good and quite surprising.  The story does not have the ending that I thought it would at all so it was nice to be surprised.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|This book just didn't do it for me. I know it was in no way meant to mimic a true story, and maybe I have been influenced by reading so much non-fiction lately, but everything about Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was just wayyy too far-fetched for me (which is saying a lot considering I fell in love with a book about zombies). I also wasn't super keen on the non-ending ending. I think instead of having the desired effect of leaving the reader wanting more, it just left me feeling, much as I felt throughout reading the whole book, slightly unsatisfied.<br /><br />The one cool thing is that there are some really weird, old photographs sprinkled throughout the book. Apparently the author found these photos at different flea markets and had been collecting them for years before writing the novel, and it was actually the pictures that inspired Riggs to write a story about these peculiar children. Though the pictures were the novel's one saving grace, they just weren't effective enough to save the book from a pretty awful plot line.

0446585025|5.0|After reading this book, I really only have one thing to say: people should learn to be more like Ellen. She comes across as a highly optimistic and just genuinely down-to-earth person. She recognizes that there are negatives in life, but it seems like she chooses to address them with humor and move forward. I think my favorite quote in the book sums her attitude up pretty well:<br /><br />\\"We all wake up on the wrong side of the bed some days. Some days we even wake up on the wrong side of our neighbor's driveway because of a late night out and some confusion over strikingly similar front doors. My point is, life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and lows. The pi&ntilde;a and the colada.\\" (p. 171)<br /><br />Though you're not going to come away understanding the meaning of life, you might grab hold of what it means to be a good person. It was an extremely quick read, and I think that aside from just having some hearty laughs along the way, people can truly benefit from reading Ellen's latest book.
B0029LHWFO|3.0|To start, I enthusiastically voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 believing that we finally had a candidate who understood the middle-lower classes (since it appeared he was one of us) and would give voice to our needs in government.  After nearly four years of watching Mr. Obama grow our government while reducing our liberties, reneging on most (if not all) his promises and general lackadaisical (if not absent) leadership, I am one of the many Obama supporters who wants to fill in the many blanks I never truly realized I had about our president.  I want to have a better understanding of why the man I see on my television does not match up to the politician I expect him to be (keeping in mind that I do have a realistic, if not pessimistic, view of politicians to begin with).<br /><br />I decided to start with finally reading \\"Dreams from My Father,\\" considering that it is Mr. Obama's autobiography and a book I have been meaning to read.  I went into it with not only an open mind, but a hope that I would see the man who so deeply appealed to me in 2007-2008.  Unfortunately, I must say that if I read this book back then I would have changed my favorable opinions toward him.<br /><br />While there is no denying that Mr. Obama is an articulate, thoughtful writer, in all his espousing on race relations he often missed the forest for trees.  We all can (and should) acknowledge that institutions such as slavery and Jim Crow are disgraceful blemishes on the face of our nation.  But why would Mr. Obama, as intelligent as he is, subscribe to racial generalizations?  I would expect Mr. Obama to be a stronger man than this.  If we are to discuss white supremacy as some pervading, all powerful establishment, then why are we not to acknowledge that there are many white families who struggle, who can be found in \\"ghettos\\" and on public assistance?  It does such a disservice to all of us, but especially the black community, to scapegoat problems such as Mr. Obama does in this book without a counter examination of self-sufficiency and responsibility.  It is particularly troubling to still scapegoat after all the hard work accomplished during the civil rights years.  I am not a naive person, but I do want to believe that my friends and I do not view each other as natural enemies - that a common ground can be reached through a universal humanitarian respect.  According to Mr. Obama's worldview in this book, such a common ground can never be reached because white racism is so deeply entrenched as to never be eradicated.  It reminds me of my former studies in radical feminism, where the patriarchy is so pervading that I as a woman will be degraded at every turn.  To me, this worldview is stifling, counter-intuitive and a waste of time.<br /><br />Further, I was surprised to see very little reflection by Mr. Obama which would explain why he would so easily subscribe to a more radical (and divisive) view of what it means to be black.  Here is a bi-racial child who was absolutely loved (particularly by his white grandparents), a child who was not the recipient of abject racism, who went on to accomplish many great things in his young life and was given opportunities that most white kids, let alone black kids, would never have.  Yet, when he receives his acceptance to Harvard Law School (to use one instance from the book), it is met with ambivalence and, dare I say, regret.  Most young people, regardless of situation, would take more than a moment to realize what an extraordinary accomplishment that is and would literally visualize the doors opening for them.  Not Mr. Obama.  Instead, he feels a betrayal to his blackness to put it simply.  Pretty disappointing.<br /><br />While I never like to speculate on what people feel, I suspect that Mr. Obama gravitated towards his radical identity because of the deep hole left by his father's absenteeism.  I submit that perhaps Mr. Obama felt closer to his black identity, and was a bit more militant about it, not simplybecause of how he \\"looked\\" to the outside world but because he was desperate to understand and feel a part of his African family, since his white family was there and accessible to him.  Looking at it from that perspective, his racial ideas are a bit easier to swallow and I am sympathetic. If Mr. Obama chose to focus his book a bit more on his personal search for racial identity as a product of a bi-racial, broken marriage, instead of the many musings on the radical ideas he was deliberately exposing himself to, I would have enjoyed his perspective more.  In fact, the times during the book when he does get personal, such as his internal discussions about his family, are revelatory and interesting.  That said, I am just speculating because Mr. Obama never makes these connections himself.<br /><br />Is Mr. Obama the same man who wrote this book in 1994?  In some ways I believe we change with age, but our past is our present.  Although I'm giving this book only three stars, I do recommend it in order to get a clear picture of Mr. Obama's worldview at a very select but critical stage of his life.because of how he \\"looked\\" to the outside world but because he was desperate to understand and feel a part of his African family, since his white family was there and accessible to him.

B007F5SG22|5.0|This must be one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read alot of books. Ayaan writes clearly and concisely and I now have a far better insight into what was until now, for me, a topic ignored, or spoken about minus real facts.  This book really had a big impact on me, it's one thing to \\"hear\\" stories of how woman and children are treated in the name of Islam and another to find out how widespread this problem is, not only in Arab and African countries, but now in Western society who are closing their eyes to it in the name of \\"not being racist\\".  As Ayaan says - is it racist to allow children to be disfigured (circumcised), beaten and given away for marriage at very young ages?  Is it racist to allow women to be downtrodden, beaten and raped in the name of culture or religion?  Woman have no rights, are expected to show total submission and even then, it's possibly not enough to save them.  She explains her childhood and growth without a \\"poor me\\" attitude.  I highly recommend that everyone read this book.  Ayaan is an incredibly intelligent, honest and brave women. My hat goes off to her. Thank you Ayaan for educating me and I am sure, many others.

0930289234|5.0|I've decided to start my adventure into comic books with Watchmen.  And I'm kind of mad, because I don't know if anything I read from here on out will be as good.  This comic was, hands down, fantastic.  I was impressed by the story itself, a satire of the superhero.  I was also impressed by the method of story telling.  The way dialogue or monologue would fit perfectly with the pictures was astounding.  That was one of the things I couldn't get over.<br /><br />I'm not really fit to write an extensive review analyzing the cultural effect or whatever.  That's not what I'm here to do.  I'd just like whoever's reading to know that this is a must have.  It's just a great book to read.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I've just seen a Tweet from Rebecca, quoting Harper Collins's comments about this book: \\"At times the writing is genuinely brilliant.\\"<br /><br />Mean ba???rds!<br /><br />At times, the writing is far above averagely brilliant, and at others, higher. This is what sets Rebecca Hamilton apart from other authors of so-called urban fantasy. There are only so many ways that vampires, wiccans and shape-shifters can be portrayed, and in the end it comes down to the author's style as to whether or not it's a worthwhile read. In Rebecca's case, is certainly is.<br /><br />This book is a joy from the opening line. If Rebecca Hamilton re-wrote the Yellow pages, she'd make it a great read.

B005SFR7YE|1.0|I watched this Royal Albert Hall version on TV during the local PBS fund raising campaign. I have see Phantom twice at the Curran in San Francisco and listened to the original CD hundreds of time. I have heard many different voices in the lead parts. The three leads at Royal Albert, singing Christine Daae, the Phantom and Raoul were disappointing. To my ear, Lisa Vroman is by far the best Christine, even better than Sarah Brightman. Franc D'Ambrosio does the best Phantom with Michael Crawford a close second. No wonder the SF and LA runs went so long.<br /><br />The acting is very artificial, maybe due to the use of close-ups. Live theater, even from cheap seats, is much better and gets stuck playing in my head. The various singers/actors performances are available on YouTube by bootleg video. Even bootlegged, Lisa Vroman is the best.

0385344228|3.0|the main character was well developed in this story, but the wife/mother wasn't as fully developed; it was difficult to understand her thoughts and actions. Perhaps that is realism, since it is a first-person account, and one can never know everything about what's inside of another person. However, as fiction goes, this lack of connection and empathy with the wife/mother resulted in a fast-forwarded, disappointing ending. With that said, the book sticks with you for better or worse.
1250006341|4.0|Complimented by the photography of Nick Briggs and the revealing Foreword by Julian Fellowes, this sumptuous volume belongs on any coffee table--furniture which the Edwardians apparently did not need. What a marvelous companion to the Carnival Films/Masterpiece Theate two-season co-production. When I first saw the book advertised I assumed it was the novel which inspired the series on PBS, but come to learn that it was the series which inspired the book! Not a plotted novel in fact; rather, a wonderful easy-to-digest description of the life of British gentry life just before, during and after the Great War. The start of the modern era with electricity, motorcars and telephones--much to the disgust of the dowager Countess, Violet, who deplores any change as a threat to the Social Establishment, where people knew their place both Upstairs and Downstairs.<br /><br /> Heavy to hold but filled with sumptuous scenes of gorgeous (and humble) interiors, with exquisite gowns and minutely-accurate uniforms of all sorts, this wonderful volume offers chapters on various topics of interest for those of us who were easily captivated by the dawn this depiction of modern Britain.  The all-inclusive Table of Contents lists: FAMILY LIFE, SOCIETY, CHANGE, LIFE IN SERVICE, STYLE, HOUSE AND ESTATE, ROMANCE, WAR, and BEHIND THE SCENES.An alphabetic cast list is provided on page 298.<br /><br />Reading this book is somewhat of a challenge for the text (even a sentence) is interrupted by pages of photos both from the production and of posters and relevant material.  Members of the cast and crew were interviewed to provide interesting quotes re their take on their roles and costumes. The author also includes delightful passages from the actual script which serve to highlight the topics of each chapter.<br /><br />So why do DOWNTON ABBEY aficionados devour this volume? Why to relive the sumptuous upstairs/downstairs soap opera on a grand scale.  (Upstairs: Desperate for an Heir, Downstairs: Eager for Advancement.) As the distinctions of Place (\\"mind your betters!\\" as butler Hudson would growl) gradually during and after WW1 both extremes of society struggled to adapt--some more than others. Although a delightful companion to the series, this excellent book was as meticulously researched as were the sets, costumes and props; it can proudly stand as a Sociology textbook--an accurate source of previously hidden details about this era British 20th Century Britain. Your favorite characters beyond and behind the \\"green baize door\\" remain eternally young--helping a new generation of readers and viewers recapture the spirit of Edwardian England.Eager for Advancement.)

Morais' debut novel, The Hundred Foot Journey, is a travel book for anyone who has ever watched The Food Network and thought, \\"Wherever that kitchen is, that's where I want to go.\\"<br /><br />Food is the language of this book. The character of Hassan Haji sometimes struggles with issues of identity and belonging as he travels from Mumbai to London to Lumiere to Paris, but always this struggle is phrased in terms of food: to make curry or frogs legs, to seek out tiffin boxes or fish and chips. Even his Muslim identity is mentioned rarely except when relating to diet: to eat pork or not. Ultimately Hassan's true identity is food. His religion is food. His ethnicity is food. His blood runs with curry and wine and butter and garlic and the jus of fresh oysters.<br /><br />It's as though Pi Patel from Life of Pi was experiencing some sort of cosmic opposites day: an Indian boy, instead of trying to find his way home while adrift and alone, is continually travelling further afield while being wrapped in the memories and support of his family; where Pi invented stories to quell his loneliness, Hassan sometimes longs for solitude so he may study the stories of the ancient cookbooks which surround him; where Pi's starvation was his constant companion, Hassan's one constant is food.<br /><br />To read more about this book or to read my other reviews, please visit my blog: [...]
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER ALERT<br />I read the first two book in this series and was totally drawn into the insanity of The Hunger Games. Catching Fire was my favorite book out of the three and i really felt like i knew Katniss and Peeta by the time it ended. In Mockingjay though, I felt like I didn't know Katniss or Peeta at all. Gale was even less evident in personality in this book than in the others, he was just there with Katniss. Based on his actios he doesn't love Katniss anymore. Finnick had no reason to be killed off as he was a big charcter that was like Katniss' big brother throughout the first half of the book, and Katniss wasn't even grieving over his death at all. She just acknowledged his death and moved on. An argument can be made that she was jaded at that point in the story, but she grieved Prim's death, no matter how little grieving was actually done. That being said, Prim had no reason to die either. She died because Coin believed Katniss would turn on her after the war and she wanted t keep her power. Her suggestion of a Hunger Games for the Capitol citizens just shows that she is the same as Snow. Katniss' agreement to the Hunger Games goes against everything we have learned about her, she would never do someting tha cruel, she only killed when she had to and she still didn't like it very much. All in all I was very disappointed in this book and I believe Collins should write a new book to replace this one to give us fans a proper ending to an incredible series.
B003L77GGK|5.0|So more Sam and Dean to love and the plot gets better and better, I haven't finished watching it all but so far it's been really good. If you love Supernatural you need to add this season to your collection.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|solid game, agree with others that the music is nice. difficulty is a little easy on the early levels... haven't gotten to the later stages yet.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I went through this series very quickly.  Great story, great characters, great ending.  I very rarely  leave reviews, but felt compelled this time.  The author needs to know he hit it out of the park with this effort.  I'm hoping that the \\"interview\\" at the end of the book is accurate and that there will be more to come.  Don't hesitate to buy this collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is such a fun game.I love toke game it is awesome! A lot of levels to Play with endlessness!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Big print plus options make this the best solitaire I've played so far. It works well whichever way the phone is turned.
B004WR125O|5.0|I was skeptical at first considering all the negative reviews and problems people were having with this adapter.<br /><br />Setup was flawless for me. You must READ the manual (both for the receiver AND the adapter). One important thing is to UPDATE the firmware on the receiver FIRST. I did so using an ethernet cable and it took 5 minutes! That's all. I used a CAT6 cable which sped things up nicely.<br /><br />I don't have an HDTV so I couldn't use the on-screen dialog boxes. I used the receiver display only. Things are even easier with the on-screen guide.<br /><br />I attached the adapter and used the automatic setup. You have an option for auto or manual. If your router has a button to \\"open up access\\" to devices for a short time, you can proceed with auto setup.<br /><br />The receiver and adapter instantly recognized and found my network and I was connected in seconds. Signal strength isn't great (25-50%) for me, but everything works fine.<br /><br />So, bottom line, read the manuals, update firmware, follow the directions and you are good to go! Streaming audio and also downloaded the ONKYO remote app on my android phone which allows me to control the internet radio options (Pandora, Slacker, etc...) volume, switch inputs, etc...<br /><br />This adapter is great and it's small enough that it isn't even noticeable on the receiver.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|Catchy title, bad, bad movie. I guess I should read the book to make any sense out of it. Couldn't understand half the mumbled, mangled British dialog. I really like Gary Oldman but he acts like he just showed up to collect his check. Yeah, I know, he is in character and is brilliant... hogwash. Save your $$$, this is the worst movie I have seen in ages and I've seen some bad ones.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This game crashes before it starts up. As soon as you click the Icon, it force closes. I give it a big thumbs down. Fix or I won't be buying another Gameloft game for a while.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|OK, I didn't read the book. Now that that's out of the way, and without eight paragraphs of text to impress ya'll about how movie smart I am and analyzing every character and performance to death... Hollywood should stay out of this game. Do yourself a BIG favor and go watch the \\"real deal\\". For pure entertainment value, you cannot beat the Swede's on this one. Go stream \\"Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition\\" on N&$F#@X to see it all.
0307236722|5.0|The product was brand new and the same as what was written in the description.<br />It a great baking book, I do suggest it to you ;).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have seen this book a few times in stores and have walked past it because the cover and the name didn't suggest a story that might interset me. I am so glad that I reconsidered buying this book. The story is compeling from the first page to the last. The author does a wonderful job of developing the characters and creating a world that comes to life as you read. I can't wait to read this author's next creation.
B000Z9PYJS|4.0|I finished Life of Pi, yes, I know I have come to this party a bit late, and about all I can say, is unlike the author promised me, I did not come away from the reading of this allegory believing any more or less in god than I already had.<br /><br />Martel's allegory actually continues to make me as skeptical of man's attempt at story telling as religion, which is what organized religion is and has always been. And I see that approach to any god, as a significantly flawed approach to any god one might choose to believe in.<br /><br />I find science and the facts that the scientific method can elicit to be far more than \\"dry, yeastless factuality.\\" Martel wants us to look for \\"the better story\\" outside of the facts, or scientific reality. I reject that intellectually weak and insincere premise. It is that kind of thinking that leads Creationist to reject scientific fact simply because they don't like the story.<br /><br />Am I glad I read it? Yes, and I would recommend it for anyone. Yes, but yes for reasons very different than Martel might have expected. His allegory is a flawed one, and his allegory brought more clearly into focus why I have such disdain for organized religion, and especially the lies that Creationists believe because they want \\"the better story.\\"<br /><br />The truly better story is always the truth elicited by the scientific method, especially for those with the intellectual curiosity and intellectual rigor to uncover the truth of that story. Though I have no problem if that scientific story is told through metaphor or allegory. That is something I would in fact recommend.
B0050Q3UEM|1.0|this app appears to be good until it asks for an email address and other info and says check your email for a preminum trial offer. I hate that.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I have now read the whole series to date over the last week or so, based on the recommendation of a friend, and I cannot believe I wasted all that time.  I kept hoping, in disbelief, that the story would somehow move forward.  About 75% of the narrative is plodding, unnecessary dialogue that adds nothing to the story.  Martin keeps adding more and more characters until by the fifth book there is something like 500 different characters and 50+ different sub-plots.  Just when you become interested and invested in a character's story, Martin moves on and you are lucky to see that character for another 2,000 pages (e.g. Bran, Arya, etc).  Apparently, this is going to be another Robert Jordan Wheel of Time type series that will take 20 years to wrap up.  I will not be continuing on with the series.
B0009JAENU|5.0|Normally I prefer Anne Sophie Mutter for all Mozart stuff for violin, but this reccord changed my mind about hilary hahn playing Mozart. The violin sound is exact and brillant. The Chamber performance is pretty good, you can fell real team work and empathy between the two voices.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|It shows it is now 79 degrees in Pittsburgh 5:54 am but is really 55 ! Online Weather bug is better.
B007JUWTI0|3.0|Not a block buster by any means... but is entertaining and worth the rental... purchase... maybe not so much. The story and effects were a tad week but overall a good watch.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the only author who I not only bought ALL 3 books in hardcover form, but also in kindle versions.  I cannot get enough of these books.  Fifty Shades makes you want to read these books over and over again and this is a first for me.  E.L. James is an absolutely fantastic author and keeps you on the edge of your seat to find out what will happen next.
1400052173|4.0|When I first sat down to read this book, I expected it to be somewhat dry. I was wrong. It has a rather literary novel feel to it, and had it not been from the disclosure that this was based on the true story of Henrietta Lacks (and her family), it would be easy to mistake it for (science) fiction.<br /><br />The book touches on issues of ethics, especially in the field of medicine, and how the HeLa cells are still being used today. I was amazed at how poignant the story was, despite its scientific nature. Rebecca Skloot managed to deliver a balanced story delving into the life of Henrietta Lacks and her (unwitting) contribution to science and its effects on her family and the world of medicine. And it's not sugarcoated, though it is quite respectful. It would have been all too easy to exploit Deborah's poverty-stricken situation, but Skloot kept the human-factor in check.<br /><br />A number of times I was brought to tears while reading and while the book doesn't offer any answers to questions posed, it does make one stop and consider what might have been taken from them in the name of scientific advancement and it also makes one think about what is held most dear.

0446343129|5.0|Compelling doesn't even touch it - this is a well thought out, well written analysis of how we are poisoning ourselves and our children. It changed the way I eat - i've been sugar free ever since. Completely sugar free and it's like coming off of drugs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the only author who I not only bought ALL 3 books in hardcover form, but also in kindle versions.  I cannot get enough of these books.

I am just disappointed that this is the last book of the trilogy.  Can't wait to read anything new she comes up with.
