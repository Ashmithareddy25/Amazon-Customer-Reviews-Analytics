0972169504|5.0|Presently I am a professor in a federal university in my home country (Brazil) and not so long ago I was a grad student just like the characters of the strip. Most of the stories are so disturbingly true that it is difficult to decide if you laugh or cry upon the memories. But most of the times I laughed. The author really got a good impression of the academic life. Now the strip is a must-read among me and my scientist colleagues and mandatory for the students I supervise who, for some reason, tend to laugh nervously while reading. Excellent.
B0016LTNL4|1.0|I was looking forward to this movie after reading all of the positive reviews from people here in the USA who thought this movie was hilarious.      In the first hour I didn't laugh even once.  (One half-chuckle, though.)   To me this was just a tedious plot of offbeat characters showing up at a funeral and acting inappropriately -- but not in a funny way.  For example, one of the guests accidentally ingests an LSD-like drug before the funeral, and then he is all weird and trippy during the service.  I kept waiting for the \\"funny\\" part to start!  After an hour I hit fast-forward on my Tivo, and finally, delete.      For me it was a big disappointment.  The other reviewers must be much more worldly than I am, or more sophisticated, or something.
B000H5TH1Q|5.0|I always loved the cover for the other version of Body Double, but this version, even though the cover has been \\"modernized,\\" has the widescreen version and some special features.  The other version lacks these features.  Why would I watch this movie on full screen when this version is better on Widescreen?  One of my favorite movies easily

1878424505|5.0|This author is able to capture important messages and advice for living that are on a parallel with more evolved books.  \\"A Course in Miracles\\" and \\"Way of Mastery\\" are books I own that convey the same message as this book, but are much more involved and complex.  This author is able to keep the message simple, to all populations...in a way that is easy to understand.  I also enjoy the conciseness of the book, the large print, easy understandability and the truth the book imparts.  It has an attractive cover, reads fast, and the hard cover makes it a beautiful gift to give.  Imagine more people living this way!  If we all lived the message of the book, this world would be healed.
B001GNFT1K|5.0|This movie was great. A long time in coming but worth waiting for.We all wondered if Carrie and Big would ever get it together. The story line is good because it picks up right where we were all dropped off.I bought this on Amazon really great price. Bought the movie called my Girlfriends and we had our own SITC party. For anyone whos lost hope and just wants to fall in love.
1591843162|4.0|In this stimulating book, Seth Godin makes a clear case for the need for a new kind of worker in today's economy: the linchpin.  Godin prods the reader to become every organization's dream worker by stepping up and overcoming what he calls \\"the resistance\\" to become artists in our own unique ways.  However, Seth isn't speaking about being an artist in the traditional sense.  Rather, he's suggesting that an artist is anyone who takes risks to produce gifts that are creative, passionate and bold.  Everyone has the opportunity to create great art and become a linchpin, whether it be through how we run a meeting, present an idea, engage with a customer or refine a process.  This book clearly and concisely lays out why businesses need this type of person in today's economy, and how you, the reader, can overcome resistance to fill this need.  However, don't expect a clear map to the finish line, because as Seth explains, there isn't one.  I highly recommend this book to any young professionals willing to take the risks, put in the hard work and produce novel ideas required to make a difference in their chosen field.

B001SF8G1Q|5.0|Frequently finding myself at odds with other Dylan devotees, I have loved this album from the start. And today, especially with this gorgeously remastered version, I love it more than ever. Few people I know have this in their collections, and it is rare to find it except at Amazon or other internet stores. I refer, affectionately, to this as Dylan's jazzy album. It is bound to lift one's spirit, no matter in what mood you are in to begin with. I certainly recommend this for the arbiter elegantiae.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|This is Roman Polanski's latest movie. That is an issue in itself, which I have decided to ignore. I believe I can have an opinion about his work independent of moral judgments of the man's life.<br />Polanski has made many very different movies. Some of them were very good. I can not remember any that would be classified as political thriller. Why did he decide to make this one? My hunch is that he was interested in other aspects of the story, not the main plot.<br /><br />The film is based on a thriller by Robert Harris. Harris normally writes a different kind of book. He is best known for `historical' thrillers, like Enigma, or Imperium, and for `alternative history' thrillers, like Fatherland, or Archangel. I like his books a lot. The Ghost was unusual in picking up a recent subject, which of course also fades more and more into history, however not entirely as long as the Iraq adventure is not finished.<br /><br />As a political thriller, it deals with the Iraq war and with Britain's participation in it. Brosnan plays a barely disguised version of Blair. He is the ex PM by now, and resides on an island like Martha's Vineyard as a guest of a US conglomerate that earns its bucks in `security', specializing on Middle Eastern issues. He gets accused of war crimes and the International Court starts prosecution. His American friends stand by him. He is facing a situation where he may not leave the US without danger of arrest.<br /><br />As a thriller, it deals with the situation of the ghostwriter. The ex-PM is writing his memoirs. His ghostwriter and long time collaborator drowns few weeks before publishing deadlines. The hastily hired replacement, McEwan, finds himself in an oddly claustrophobic situation on this island with mostly bad weather, in an isolated super-safe high- tech house, with neurotic people who are always highly strung. Main source of tension is Mrs. ex-PM, who is fighting  psycho wars with everybody, most intensively with Brosnan's personal assistant (an attractive blonde who warns off any expected ouvertures by McEwan by telling him that she misses her husband, within less than an hour of their `cooperation'.). It is an atmosphere of  suspicion, jealousy and hysteria.<br /><br />Suspicions about the predecessor's death begin to grow in the ghost's mind. Was he murdered? Strange clues are found in his material. Quickly McEwan finds and investigates traces of a conspiracy. His relation with the boss is not good. (On first encounter, Brosnan asks: who are you? McEwan says: I am your ghost. That is not received too favorably, though Mrs. Ex says: see, he is funny.) His relationship with the boss's wife is difficult (he asks her: did you ever want to be a proper politician yourself? she answers this insult by asking: and you, did you ever want to be a proper writer?) ...<br /><br />Here I have to stop relating the plot, to avoid spoilers.<br />What do I think of the film? The plot is too contemporary to be a comfortable subject for a thriller. Its characters are too identifiable. It is too easy to confuse fiction with allegations. If it were mainly meant to carry a political message, it is too indecisive and loses its steam through its fictional elements. As we say in German: not fish, not meat.<br />The political message that stands, independent of twists and turns of the plot, is the accusation that every single decision that the ex-PM has taken as PM was in the interest of a foreign government.<br />Esthetically, the island life and the siege situations, when protesters and press bother the inmates of the `asylum', have a strong identity and mood. Was Polanski telling us of his own situation in Switzerland?who warns off any expected ouvertures by McEwan by telling him that she misses her husband, within less than an hour of their `cooperation'.).

0452284392|5.0|Linked by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi breaks down the complex nature of life's most intriguing components (social interaction, the internet, power grids, etc) and provides to the reader the importance of understanding these networks in order to improve the efficiency of modern society. Barabasi describes how \\"power laws\\" and \\"scale-free networks\\" weave in and out of our lives, and how the idea of networking involves all subject areas, especially mathematics, physics, and computer science.<br /><br />I'm currently reading \\"Bursts\\", Barabasi's newest book. Bursts is very similar to Linked in that the research proving the two concepts involves nearly identical methodology and the laws that make both the concepts believable are indeed also very similar.<br /><br />I believe that the pure ingenuity of Barabasi to develop the concept of networking and study the ins and outs of the complex subject area, developing groundbreaking hypotheses along the way, easily earns this book a rating of 5-stars, though I would like to see his further works developed for those who are interested in the exact methodologies and not just generalizations.
B0035V35P8|5.0|i love this freaking movie one of the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life.

B0038P59A0|1.0|If you have actually read and love Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal characters, then I can sum up this review by saying: DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! You may run the risk of an apoplectic fit.<br /><br />Apparently, Holmes is a short, filthy, scruffy, drunken twit who rummages through Watson's medical bag to drink his anesthetic for cataract surgery (which would have been cocaine, in the Victorian era). Yes, SH did use injectable cocaine, however I found this insinuation he was a desperate addict rather unsettling. It is also implied Holmes has had an illicit affair with Irene Adler -- whose character is moderately chafing in this movie. Best of all, the Doctor, instead of being awed by Holmes, despises him. Oh, and Baker Street was a filthy cesspool, Holmes and Mrs. Hudson appear to be mortal enemies, etc. It was nothing more than a parody of Conan Doyle's characters, using name recognition and the older than dirt Sherlock Holmes fandom to make a buck.<br /><br />For everyone else...<br /><br />My main qualm with the movie was how disjointed it appeared from beginning to end. One has only to watch the nigh on a dozen trailers to realize how many scenes did not make the final cut. Unfortunately, someone down at editing did a botched job of seaming these holes, and it showed, painfully. Especially in regards to that entire Holmes/Adler side plot. It was confusing at best, but mostly just annoying. The plot was thin, outdated, and ridiculous. I enjoy a good occult-ish themed flick as much as anyone else, but the operative word here is GOOD. This reeked. Again, I had the feeling the flow was disjointed, that scenes were added or omitted without enough forethought to continuity. This only detracted from an already lame plot.<br /><br />I could go on about the dumbed down dialogue which borrowed heavily from quotes out of the original stories to spice up bad writing. Or the entirely overdone action sequences that were sorely out of place and had me bored to tears. Or how Hollywood bastardized two of the most beloved literary characters to modernize and re-invent them for greed & 21st century audiences.<br /><br />In the end, it was a mildly entertaining steam-punk movie, but not one that was able to hold my attention for very long. After a while it became grating on the nerves to sit through, due to the combination of terrible writing, plotting, drawn out slow-mo 'action' scenes, mediocre acting, and the disgrace this was to Holmes & Watson.most beloved literary characters to modernize and re-invent them for greed & 21st century audiences.

B003P8D6JQ|3.0|The music is quite an interesting mix of bands; but most of the bands I have never heard of before with the expection of Muse and Vampire Weekend. It's a lot of indie music. However, I'm willing to admit the music was quite good and that it grew on me after a while.<br /><br />I kind of wish that most of the songs weren't album only because I just really liked Jacob's Theme, Muse's song, and Vampire Weekend's song on it. The other songs were ok, but are not really my taste in music. I still got the whole album on my ipod, but that was only to get the album only songs. I would recommend a listen to it for fans of the bands and Twilight books.<br /><br />It took a lot to get used to this whole album, but even after hearing all the songs over 5 times I still didn't really care for it.

Do these exercises consistently and you will get in the best shape of your life. Thanks Mark for sharing your knowledge.  My metablolism has revved up like never before... I eat constantly throughout the day and still am losing weight. I do these exercises to the max so I really push myself.  And I just got started with Mark's book. I can't wait to workout Monday morning cause I know what this workout is doing to my body. I'm getting ripped and not spending hours at the gym. Do this workout like a maniac and just see what happens....you won't believe your eyes and how you feel. Fit as a fiddle...lean like a predator cat..that's what you'll be.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I've only viewed the first disc so far, ( I just got it in the mail Friday) and I absolutely love this series!! Not only are the videos informative, but the shots are outstanding. I definitely recommend this series on Blu Ray to anyone who loves nature documentaries or family shows.
B002ZCY7PU|4.0|First, NBC is to be commended for bringing this series back for a third season (midseason) as well as renewing it for the coming year.  Too many times, an excellent series has been axed because of ratings, demographics, etc.    The third season takes the viewer to a different level as Chuck becomes a full blown spy.  Criticism aside, this season brought out more of the personal storylines of the characters.      In Chuck VS. The Tic Tac, John Casey's history is presented with a few surprises tossed into the plot.  It is one of the best episodes of the series.    Chuck Vs. First Class: on his way to Paris Chuck meets Hannah (Kristin Kreuk).  For the next several episodes Chuck attempts to forget Sarah with his attention on Hannah, but alas, Chuck has to face his true feelings for Sarah, and unfortunately, Hannah is left betrayed and feeling used by Chuck.  This was not Chuck's best moment--his nice guy image took a beating.  Blame the writers for this mess.    Awesome and Ellie are given more to do in this season.  The Buy More gang have their moments as well, especially in Chuck Vs. The Beard--great episode, and their greatest moments in the season finale--Chuck VS. The Ring!     Super Agent Daniel Shaw is tossed into this seasonal bag with some mixed reviews.  Sarah changing her romantic focus from Chuck to Shaw was a bit lame.  Sorry.  Of course, everything works out for Chuck and Sarah as the season progressed as we knew it would--romantic destiny is difficult to alter.    Shaw and Chuck have their moments.  The confrontations led up to a great climax, more than once.    In the final two episodes-- Chuck VS. The Subway and Chuck VS. The Ring, there are twists and turns, surprises and an ultimate showdown between the Ring and Chuck's Gang.  There is a surprise ending which you never saw coming which will lead into season four.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I just saw the movie in theaters today...   First off, let me say it is not as good as the original, but it is a good movie...  The original had more intensity, more drama, more heartfelt americana & personality...    However, they did a really good job making this new version very, very similar(almost word for word in many parts of the movie)to the old original movie...    Most of the scenes were intense & well acted by most of the actors...  The kung fu moves were very well done by all the actors in the movie...  The teaching/training by J. Chan was great, and he played the part of the former mr. miyagi very well...  Jaden Smith did a pretty good job for his first major film, but the girl that he  likes in the movie fell a little short of intensity & acting ability in this movie... not much support for Jaden from her...  Jadens mom in the movie did very well in the the scenes that she was in & she was very real in her acting...  The movie also had a great soundtrack & the songs fit the scenes quite well, although it would have been nice to hear some of the old songs from the original in the movie too...    I really liked the fact that the movie was based in China with their culture etc...  I also liked the fact that this version was very similar to the old version, and it didnt just get a complete make over, like a lot of the remakes get these days...    Overall, I thought the movie was a success, and I think there will be a #2 very soon...  I would recommend to see this moves in the theaters first, and then watch it on  dvd when it is released...  thanks...
193413712X|5.0|'George Washington Crosby began to hallucinate eight days before he died'. So begins this luminous book. As George fades in and out of  consciousness we get flashbacks in which we glimpse this ordinary man's life as a machinist, a teacher, a fixer of clocks, a father and a husband. Interwoven with this is the story of his father Howard's life as he goes forth as an itinerant peddler with a cart and his mule Prince Edward, selling an assortment of items like soap and packages of pins for two pennies. Here is also portrayed the essence of the American spirit at the very turn of the 2oth century, the backbreaking work and integrity that has made this country great.    Harding's descriptive powers will take your breath away. Whether he is describing how it feels to have an epileptic seizure or an encounter with a literary hermit, or the very fabric of the universe, you will see and feel the world in a new way.    There are some who have written reviews here who find the time and consciousness shifts in the novel difficult to comprehend. For this they criticize the novel. I did not find the novel difficult and read it in one sitting. You must read it slowly and carefully and you will be amply rewarded. This exquisite book is a revelation and a delight.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Usually when I get huge box sets like Woodstock etc, what I do is I'll listen to it once and then I'll most likely make a selection of the best songs on there. And then I'll delete the rest from my iTunes but I'll occasionally bring them back. Here's what I have on my playlist. Hope you like it.<br /><br />Disc 1.<br />Richie Havens: Freedom - It's what he was seeing around him. And it was totally improvised.<br />Bert Sommer: And When It's Over - What a fantastic voice!<br />Joan Baez: Sweet Sir Galahad - The angelic voice that sang the children to their sleep<br />Country Joe McDonald: Donovan's Reef - A lyrical masterpiece. Makes me think of Dal&iacute;.<br />Santana: Soul Sacrifice - The acoustic songs are over and now it's time to get to the Latin music.<br />Canned Heat: Woodstock Boogie - 28 minutes featuring the best slide guitar player ever, Alan Wilson<br /><br />Disc 2:<br />Sly And The Family Stone: Medley - Get up and dance to the funky music!<br />The Who:  Amazing Journey / Sparks - I've never heard Townshend play like that before, man! What amazing feedback. I can feel the sparks if you know what I mean!<br />Jefferson Airplane: Won't You Try / Saturday Afternoon - The triple harmonies soar like birds<br />Country Joe & The Fish: Silver And Gold - The most beautiful solo I've ever heard<br />Crosby, Stills, Nash And Young: Wooden Ships - Fine harmonies from the Laurel Canyon boys<br />The Paul Butterfield Blues Band: Love March - Definitely the most interesting song on the album. I dig Buzzy Feiten's guitar playing<br />Jimi Hendrix: The Star Spangled Banner, etch. - I love the way he closes out this playlist.
B003L16FAE|1.0|There are two Blu Rays of the film. The old and this new one. The old is grainy like the film itself. Unfortunately the compression is only MPEG2 and can't handle the grain properly. It looks like film with some compression artifacts on top. This new Blu Ray is the same transfer, just with large doses of digital grain filtering applied and then well compressed. It does not look like film anymore, it looks like a video game. A wax museum with CGI puppets and scenery. If that's your thing you will love it. I'll stick with the old BD and wait for FOX to come to their senses and give the unfiltered transfer an appropriate AVC encoding. Or better, redo the transfer so it's state of the art. Filtering older transfers to death so the anti grain crowd is appeased is just lame.

0061703257|4.0|I thought the book was very good--I read it in two days.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, my review contains spoilers....<br /><br />When I started reading the book I actually thought Teddy was a US Marshall.  In fact, I was pretty sure he was until I got to chapter 17/18.  When I started reading chapters 17/18 I first thought he was delusional and Chuck didn't exist--that he only existed in Teddy's mind.  Especially in chapter 18 when he was talking w/ Crawley about leaving the island...Crawley said something like, so you'll be leaving...the first ferry...and Teddy said, \\"As long as someone wakes US up.  When Crawley questioned \\"US\\" Teddy said, yeah, my partner.  When Crawley said to Teddy that he didn't have a partner and that he came alone; that's when I knew that something was up.  Again, I simply thought that Teddy made Chuck up in his head and that he never existed.  I stopped reading for a while and went back to the beginning of the book to see if my theory was right, but I realized I was wrong because Chuck interacted with everyone too, so he did exist.  Then I thought maybe Chuck was his real partner, but he was taken by the guards.  I was totally floored when Chuck appeared in the lighthouse as Dr. Sheehan. (I actually forgot all about him) I knew something was up at that point.  My first inclination was that Crawley and Dr. Sheehan wanted to admit Teddy as a patient...they were trying to make him crazy so they could say that Teddy went bezerk during his time at the hospital.  I was actually getting annoyed at Crowley.  However, when Teddy woke up and admitted he was Laeddis I figured it right then and there that he was all along a patient there.  I liked how they ended the book though with \\"Teddy\\" and \\"Chuck\\" at the end.  In a way I felt happy for \\"Teddy\\" because for him life was normal and Chuck was still his partner.  He didn't have to undergo all of the treatment (and Crowley didn't want to do that to him either) and he can still go on freely (well, free as I mean he's not stuck in Ward C) and be somewhat happy.<br /><br />So, that's just my opinion of the book.  No harsh remarks if you don't agree...I'm entitled to my own opinion.  I'm going to watch the movie later.  I'm hoping that the move stays true to the book.  I read some review...people hated it and some loved it.e as I mean he's not stuck in Ward C) and be somewhat happy.    So, that's just my opinion of the book.

1420931571|5.0|Fitzgerald's tale is obviously a classic, but which edition is the best buy? There are so (or is \\"too\\"...) many available. Personally, I like  this editon [[ASIN:1438295219 The Beautiful and Damned]] (yes, you need to click the link to see which one it is as Amazon combines many reviews together), especially because of the captivating cover shot. A great value IMHO.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|I have to say i am equally amused and pissed at the musically ignorant queers who gave this album a bad review. especially the fool who said he'd rather hear the new mariah carey. this album kicks ass. keith richards rules on this album there's no other album like this in the stones catalog. highlights are : stop breakin down, all down the line, just want to see his face, and a stomper that should be amongst one of the all time greatest drinking songs...sweet virginia. granted there are a song or two that i can pass on every now and then, but the album is about 90% great, classic stones. do not expect many \\"big hits\\" but expect some sloppy, gritty rock and roll. a lot of stones haters that probably never even heard the album are dissing it. don't listen to them.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Hard to believe a movie about toys made me feel emotional but that's the strength of the story this movie has! And I haven't felt that way for a long time when I've seen a new film. I may have felt sad or felt an connection to a character before but I've never actually cried (except in Titanic but that's because it was a bad movie, not because it was emotional). Most of the main cast returns except for the late Jim Varney (Slinky) and Joe Ranft (Lenny and Wheezy). While Wheezy, Bo Peep, RC and most of the other toys are gone, Blake Clark takes over as the voice of Slinky, which works just fine for me. If I hadn't known about Varney's death, I never would've caught the difference. New actors include Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton, Whoopi Goldberg and Bonnie Hunt. The animation is brilliant, consistent with the two other films. The story is actually well put together, as I mentioned. The toys (what ones are left), having had the benefit of two films to be developed, are a close-knit family who don't want to be thrown away now that Andy is on his way to college. The toys wind up at a daycare where they are practically torn up. I won't go into too many details but the film has a \\"Great Escape\\" feel and near the climax is where I started to get teary eyed. One of the few films to be a \\"3\\" and still be consistent in the story and development of what previous films had. A far better \\"3\\" movie than Spider-Man, Batman (Forever), Superman, Shrek, Star Trek, Pirates of the Carribean (I can't think of anymore). Go see it, its a perfect end to a good trilogy.
B00006I53S|4.0|Arguably the best Canon walk-around lens for the money if you're not buying \\"L\\" series gear.  The USM system is fast and quiet, the full-time manual focus is very helpful when re-selecting a macro target, and the image stabilizer makes for better hand-held shots at slow shutter speeds.  The physical construction has only one flaw: The lens is heavy, and much of the weight is concentrated in the front element, meaning that accidental telescoping will occur once the mechanism loosens up with use.  That's a \\"when\\", not \\"if\\", so expect it to happen eventually.    That issue aside, it has very good image quality, offers as much zoom range as any hobby or pro-sumer photographer could reasonably demand in one lens assembly, and even produces usable high-magnification shots in the near-macro range (shown as \\"Macro\\" in the focus assembly's depth-of-field window).  The 1.6x crop factor on APS-C bodies (pretty much any Canon dSLR except for the 1Ds and 5D series) will limit this lens' effective field of view at 45-216mm, even though the curvature and depth of field will still be 28-135mm equivalents.  That's a little narrow on the low end, so the EF-S 15-85mm IS USM lens and EF-S 17-55 IS USM lens should definitely be considered by all APS-C owners before making the final purchase decision, but most shooters won't have any problems with this lens.    The lens has a 72mm filter adapter, so good-quality filters (particularly 72mm circular polarizers) will be fairly pricey.  Buyers should budget around $50-75 for a decent circular polarizer and a UV filter/lens protector.  Search \\"72mm filter\\" on Amazon to see a good selection.    Final note: Don't be fooled by Amazon's ongoing policy of deceptive list prices for SLR gear, which they would never charge and no sane person would ever pay.  As I write, Amazon is showing a crossed-out $753.77 as the List Price for this lens, while the inflated MSRP on Canon's own US website is $479.99.  Amazon's current \\"real\\" price of $359.99 is very competitive, but it is not a \\"52% savings\\".  I'm disappointed that Amazon's marketing department has so little respect for their customers, but their customer service quality remains excellent, so buy with confidence -- just be sure you know your fair market value prices before clicking through.

0884271536|5.0|Unlike other project management guides or BoKs, it uses real life like examples to introduce Critical Chain (Theory of Constraints) approach to project management.     Storyline is around an executive MBA Project Management class, where the professor (Richard Silver, main character) discusses and tries to address issues in project management using real life example from the class. In the process, they evolve \\"Critical Chain\\" approach to project management by applying principles of Theory of Constraints.     The book is written very much like a fast paced novel with quite a few plots; struggle of a professor at work and home, shortcomings of teaching methodologies, project management using theory of constraints and few more.     good: fast-paced, like novel not a guide, challenges thinking process   bad: bit difficult to follow without understanding of Theory of Constraints, not as good as The Goal.     Must read for all project managers, as it gives another perspective or approach to project management, and can be applied to their existing framework.
030726999X|5.0|I have read negative review of The Girl With the Dragon tattoo, The Girl<br />Who Played With Fire, and finally The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest...but I found all three deeply engrossing!  I stumbled on the first book in a drug store...the second in the same store...and then because by then I HAD to read the third book...I preordered it from Amazon and was very satisfied both by the service and the end of the book.  I regret that Stieg Larsson is no longer here on earth to write more!  What a great author he was!
B000YG0HWG|5.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a book with many aspects and every time I read it, I gained a new perspective. I have read it 3 times and want to read it again, a must must read book.     I first read it by chance, when picked up from my office library before going out for my first solo motorcycle ride (on Royal Enfield) and thought it will give an insight about motorcycles. To be honest, it did. I prepared my list of must haves using references in the book. From a high level view, it appears that it tells you about maintaining a motorcycle, by someone who owned a motorcycle and spent time fiddling around with it.     This book is not about motorcycles, it is about values. It is about inquiry in to values (title).     It gave me whole new insight about how we perceive everything; our work, our relationships, our interests, our passion and our life.     Then I read it twice in next 4 years at different phases of my life and career. It helped me emotionally and professionally. Not because, this books teaches you something. It forces you to think, inquire about yourself and what you want to be.     Pirsig makes a lot of amazing points throughout the book. The book is about inquiry in to values, which is the reason it is worth a read.     -- ashutosh jhureley
030726999X|5.0|As one European reviewer said, \\"I was overcome with sadness when I turned the last page of the Trilogy of novels by Stieg Larrson\\". I felt the same way. They were completely absorbing- the heroine's journey, was a tribute to one extraordinary human being's struggle for survival, in a hostile world she didn't create. How Lisbeth  defends herself, with Michael's help, is a fascinating journey, indeed. Justice was served , in Spades.!My highest recommendation.!Mallory Walker

0891419063|4.0|I really wanted to read this book because Eugene Sledge was my favorite character from the TV series.  What he made it through without being wounded (at least not physically) is hard to believe until you read about it.
0385504225|3.0|The book is entertaining. I rate it 3 because it starts GREAT, then gets Good, and the end is TERRIBLE. The plot is definetly interesting. Talks about the founding Fathers, and about all the esoteric things they believed in, so gets your interest, but then it's too much of the same over and over, with a psycho character that makes no sense, and then the end is disappointing..
B002VPE1B6|5.0|For a person who did not see it in 3D I was still amazed with the movie, sound, picture and everything else! I will for warn you that you will not get extras. But they plan to re-release this in November in a 3D version and it will have extras. So just pick up the movie it is like eye candy.
1587613379|5.0|As stated in my title, I found it to be a great view on what the ideal poly world would look like, while acknowledging the difficulty of reaching this utopia. That being where the \\"practical\\" aspect comes in. Poly relationships appear to require a much finer touch in order for everyone to be made happy, and in some cases, may end up being impossible for a given set of individuals. Certainly a dangerous road to take, but with rewards that may make it all worthwhile. I enjoyed it on the same level as I did Opening Up, though would have liked to see more testimony from actual poly groups, individuals and couples.

B003PWPGT0|4.0|I have to listen to a new album at least 5 or 6 times before I can decide how well I like it. After hearing this one at least that many times, I do like most of the songs pretty well. I decided to try another test yesterday and put all of my Tom Petty music on shuffle. I don't have everthing, but I do have a lot of it. I wanted to see how I felt about the Mojo songs when they came up, as compared to everything else. In my opinion the Mojo songs hold their own, and that says a lot.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Coming five years after \\"The Rising,\\" Springsteen and the E Street Band's most recent effort, \\"Magic,\\" is well worth the listen.  Though it doesn't measure up to the triumph of their previous album, there are quite a few good songs, and the whole thematically holds together well.    My favorite track is, without a doubt, \\"Long Walk Home,\\" which combines nostalgia for home with a recognition of the ways America has sometimes gone wrong, and the knowledge that it sometimes takes a long, hard time to get back to something you've lost.    Other excellent songs on the album are \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" \\"You'll Be Comin' Down,\\" and the title track, \\"Magic\\".  There's only one song I habitually skip, \\"Gypsy Biker.\\"  The rest are all good listening.    If you like Springsteen's recent work, you'll like \\"Magic.\\"

1439148953|5.0|I recived the book in wonderful condition from Amazons dealer. It was really well packed. I love finding the pages have been turned to mark the previous readers spot, and one or two coffee spots. I have added tea spots.  I was attracted to the novel from a classical music interview in Australia with Margret Throsby and Colm Toibin.    The story Brooklyn, is fabulous. Being of Irish decent, I can see a lot of my attitudes and mannerisms may have been genetically passed. I love the sensitivness to being alone and the efforts that are involved in fitting in. Mind you I have not finished the book, it is reserved for my tea breaks, and I must say that I am sneaking away from the crowds to finish it. Really a very lovley story.But not really for young teenagers.
0307266303|5.0|This book is more than what I expected.  Running is a big part of the Tarahumara indians and the US ultrarunners.

I am injury prone as the author and find the new running methods in this book life changing.  I hope to live to be a centenarian.  I hope to be able to hike 25 miles when I'm 95 like one of the characters in this book.  The description of th Tarahumara coincides with Howard Zinn's description of the native indian as \\"egalitarian.\\"

0316017922|5.0|I loved this book.  It's full of unique insights into success, and wise conclusions.  I will definitely check out Blink and The Tipping Point after enjoying this book.<br /><br />I listened to Outliers unabridged on audio CD, narrated by the author.  Gladwell is surprisingly, a remarkable narrator.  He has a rich, confident voice that's a pleasure to listen to.
030726999X|5.0|VERY WELL WRITTEN, VERY EXCITING AND INTERESTING STORY.  COMPLEX CHARACTERS WHICH COME ALIVE THANKS TO GREAT SKILL OF THE AUTHOR.  WE HAVE ALL THREE OF HIS BOOKS IN THE TRILOGY, ALL OF THEM EXCELLENT.  THE THIRD ONE GOT A  LESS EXCITING REVIEW BY BOOK REVIEWERS, BUT I ENJOYED ALL THREE OF HIS BOOKS EQUALLY.  IT IS SO SAD THAT HE DIED BEFORE COMPLETING MORE IN THE SERIES.
B003A4IFDW|2.0|I thought I would like this when I listened to the samples, and I wanted to like it because the material is excellent, and these versions are genuine reinterpretations and not simple covers, but it did not hold my interest after a couple listens. Basically, I felt the tempos were overall too slow (occasionally they seemed to disappear altogether), and that both her voice and the arrangements were lacking in range and dynamics. Others of course may disagree but that was my reaction. It Don't Come Easy and Maybe I'm Amazed came off best, imo (although I would have liked to hear the last one with more of a brass and sax arrangement than this arrangement which is very similar to the original). The ones I liked least, all of which share the flaws noted above, were Isn't It a Pity, Wish You Were Here, No Time to Live, Salt of the Earth, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, and Nights in White Satin.
0446567337|2.0|I did not like this book.  I'm a big Nicholas Sparks fan, but this one was disappointing.  I simply didn't buy that John and Savannah really loved each other.  In his book Nights in Rodanthe, the characters also fall in love very quickly, but in that one it was believable.  He made you feel the emotions along with the characters, but not in this one.  John and Savannah fought very immaturely, and honestly Savannah wasn't all that likable.  Too much of the story was told in a boring, past tense, \\"this happened, then this happened, and then this happened\\" type of way.  It was monotonous.  And then the ending.  I've read a lot of Spark's books, and I know that they often end sad or bittersweet, but usually they feel right to me.  They make me sad, but I see how they fit the story and I get over it.  This book left me feeling uncomfortable, like something really hadn't gone right.  The fact that they still loved each other, but weren't together... I just couldn't make it sit right with me.  And no, I don't need a hollywood happy ending to like a book, but with this book I thought one was coming, and then when it didn't, it just left me really disappointed.  Maybe this is because I've been in a long distance relationship for the last year and a half.  Maybe it hit too close to home.  I don't know.  But to summarize, the love didn't feel real (at least not at first), Savannah wasn't particularly likable, and the plot progressed with an odd pace, with too few details in places where they should have been.  It almost felt like the book wasn't about John and Savannah's relationship at all, but about John's life in the military.  And the ending is depressing.
0198534469|5.0|This book is a real treat.  It gives a beautiful visual description of complex differentiation.  I was happy to learn how to visualize this due to my \\"lack of four-dimensional imagination\\".  The author elevates the abstract symbolic mathematics into a living picture of vectors transforming through stretches and twists.  He takes the reader into the kitchen and uses a knife and rolling pin to really illustrate conformal mapping and its relationship to complex differentiation.  Using the author's words to summarize:  \\"The basic philosophy of this book is that while it often takes more imagination and effort to find a picture than to do a calculation, the picture will always reward you by bringing you nearer to the Truth.\\"  If that isn't the Richard Feynman philosophy!

097747609X|5.0|I read this book to see if we are repeating history in any way at all.  And YES we are.  The one difference is that we now have a leader in America that has accellerated the pace of the Nazi's.  Hitler had his brown shirts where Obama has his purple shirts.  Hitler had Gurbles vs Gibbs and Axelrod.   Hitler had Himmler vs Rob Emmanuel and Andy Sterns. The parellels can go on and on.  But what I found terrifying is that our president is moving at light speed in comparison while following a very simular road map.    This book shows just how deplorable the planning of the Nazi regime was but it also shows how we have not learned anything from world history and this time it is American politicians who have taken up the National Solcialist methodologies.
0142002038|5.0|Only James Bond could have uncovered a major villain who everyone else thinks is just a reclusive farmer of bird droppings. Did Fleming perhaps think this one up after buying a new car that got \\"annointed\\" once too often? Dr. Julius No (a bird doo-doo entrepreneur with a doctorate, no less!) is involved with re-directing American test missiles by radio to hit cities, and like all good hoods has a \\"legit\\" operation where he uses local labor to harvest fertilizer (apparently Scotts et al hadn't made their fertilizer breakththroughs yet). The trouble with a cover business to hide crime is that taking often-violent security measures is going to attract the attention of the cops anyway. Cops like James Bond. The movie version left out the guano aspect for propriety's sake, as well as avoiding the \\"aw come on\\" reaction by viewers. All Bond films are more than a little parody, but this book in its own right is parody enough already. Fleming must have giggled his way through this after picking a poisoned 007 up off a Paris hotel floor last time around. Only to get sent out on a haw-haw mission like this! Here's half of a spoiler--no movie death in a nuke reactor cooling pool for Dr. No. For him, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang, but with a FLOOOMMMPH!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|amazing movie, but a letdown....this version has no special features at all. After realizing this I read that the special features wont come out till Xmas?? Kinda lame but whatever... Bluray is the best way to watch this movie. I showed it to a friend who only saw it on DVD like 8 times, and she said she saw a lot of different details she never saw before.
B0001XAS2G|5.0|Most people I know say \\"Year of the Cat\\" when Al Stewart is mentioned. It seems to me that nearly everyone in my age cohort had that album in their collections when it was current and for many of them, its the only Stewart record they ever owned. Time Passages, though it produced two hit singles, has been somewhat overshadowed by its ultra-popular predecessor. But if you listen again today, you'll find that it has a quality that is undiminished by the passage of time. Stewart gave the record company something it wanted, a pair of radio-friendly singles, and he gave his core public the intellectual heft and memorable tunes they had come to expect with the rest of the album.  There are a lot of great songs here, including the over-played title cut. My favorites are the mysterious Life In Dark Water, the bittersweet Almost Lucy, the mystical and poetic Timeless Skies, and the sublime End of the Day. My least favorite song is one of those that received heavy airplay on commercial radio: Song on the Radio. Why? Because it SOUNDS commercial and somewhat repetitious. Thankfully Stewart has largely shied away from further commercialism over the years.  Time Passages is accompanied by an attractive and useful booklet containing a few pictures, album info and the lyrics. If you read and digest the lyrics, you will appreciate the depth of Stewart's intellect and the scope of his subject matter. Who says that good pop music has to be inane? Stewart is one of many who proves that it doesn't. If intelligent lyrics coupled with stylistic virtuosity appeal to you, then Time Passages is a recording that belongs in your music library.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I agree that Half-Blood Prince is by FAR the most boring film in the entire Harry Potter series.  This is because the entire film has a very quiet and uninteresting storyline, a noticeably dull atmosphere, and a familiarity that's getting quite annoying by this point, to be totally honest.  Almost like they're milking the Harry Potter series for all it's worth.  A movie like this makes such a theory seem VERY likely.    In addition to the movie just being boring to watch (among other problems) the majority of the film has a \\"been there, done that\\" feel to it.  The walking footsteps that appear whenever Harry Potter opens up a map?  Been there, done that.  The images of people moving inside the picture frames?  Yes, we've seen that several times by this point, and yes, at one point it was really cool to witness but now it's just repeating the same old formula that made the Harry Potter series successful in the first place.  The famous broom game?  Yes, it's here (though only seen in brief moments).    Another annoying aspect of Half-Blood Prince is the way Harry Potter and his friends carry on the most pointless conversations imaginable concerning girlfriends and friendships.  The entire first half of the film deals with this, and it's really totally unnecessary.  We're talking about an hour and a half of this specific storyline.  NOT good.    Also, there's hardly any special magical effects that involve Harry Potter and his friends casting bizarre spells. This means the adventure and fun has been almost completely sucked out of it.  Furthermore, there's no really big dramatic finish involving Harry battling some exciting and dangerous creature.  Nope, none of that takes place.      To give one example, Harry and friends stumble upon a huge tarantula.  Instead of something neat taking place possibly involving Harry's magical long list of spells bringing the creature to life, it's just a boring conversation between all the characters and a howling dog.  Incredibly dull.    I shouldn't have to read the books either because I've been following along to the movie series the entire time.  If I have to read the books, that means the movie writers didn't do their job in delivering a satisfying storyline.    You also have to understand that since I've been following the Harry Potter movie series since the very beginning, it makes perfect sense that I should expect a dramatic and exciting conclusion out of each movie in the series because that's the successful formula they've been using.      This film is a really big letdown, and I think it's time for the series to stop for good.  Enough is enough guys.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I'm so pleased to see the 4 and 5-star reviews racking up for this book - they are extremely well-deserved.  This is one of those books that comes along maybe once or twice a year, that completely absorbs me and turns out to be exactly the book I wanted\needed to read.  I'm just surprised this hasn't gotten more buzz; I only actually learned of Ms. Egan because two of the chapters in this book were first published as short stories in The New Yorker.  (She seems to need a Lulu of her own on the case!)  Anyway, other reviews have sketched the outlines of plot and tone,etc.  I just wanted really to record my own 5 stars for this book and urge anyone who's on the fence about this book to go for it.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  I'm off to check out Ms. Egan's previous works.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I could listen to this album every day.  Vocals and guitars are outstanding, rhythm section outstanding.  Excellent songwriting with a good blend of musical styles - not all the songs sound like the same tune over and over.  Real musicians playing real music in the age of auto tuned hip hop electronic garbage is always refreshing to me.<br /><br />ps. I saw the Raconteurs play live two summers ago in Cincinnati.  Awesome.
0307454541|1.0|I've never seen such hype over such a poorly-written book as \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", and expect the remaining in the series are equally bad.  I bought it based on  word of mouth and extensive coverage in the media, and because I'm an avid fan of thrillers. The book has an interesting premise and different setting, and that's where it ended for me.  The writing is mechanically plodding, to the point where the author kills all story momentum in each chapter. The characters are one-dimensional and bland in dialog and thought, which is an unfortunate waste of material, given the sharp contrasts between then. And the plot line is so ordinary that I can't imagine anyone enduring the book to find out who did it.  (I didn't, and I don't care)  And now, this week, I see that \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" has splashed it all over their front page. Let's hope the movies will buck trend and be far better than the books... as I'm certain that there will be movies coming soon.  Folks, the emperor's wearing no clothes!  Don't buy it, don't waste your time when there are so many far better storytellers out there.
B000E5N62U|3.0|Let's see. Three solo albums for Fagen in 24 years. So he's not churning them out so fast that quality has to suffer.     Admittedly The Nightfly from '82 was and is a masterpiece album. It holds up to repeated listening even now. Kamikiriad, 11 years later, was well-crafted, perhaps less well-loved, but I listened to it a lot when it came out. I'm not drawn back to it, and perhaps the very cold, dead, ultra-digital sound has something to do with that.     After a successful Steely Dan revival, Fagen returned to solo work. What have we got in Morph the Cat? Digital recording technology has definitely improved since Kamikiriad, and Morph is more natural sounding, though still acoustically sterile with very little ambiance apart from digital echo/reverb.     I don't know the running time, but these 8 1/2 songs (8 songs plus a reprise of the title track) seem to run a lot longer than the songs on The Nightfly, which were reasonably concise and compact -- I think that was part of their charm. My view is that many of the songs on Morph could have a minute or two chopped out of them, which would only improve them.     The instrumentation and arrangements are very familiar, very similar to his other solo albums, similar to Steely Dan with less guitar evident. The musicians are precise, crack accompanists and soloists. No complaints there. Fagen's voice is easier to take than in the early Steely Dan days, and his harmony overdubbing has only gotten better.     It's all pleasantly listenable, and my favorite tracks are Morph the Cat, H Gang, The Night Belongs To Mona, and Mary Shut The Garden Door. If I was a download-buying consumer, I'd snatch those and leave the rest.     This album isn't bad by any means, it's just pale compared to his greater solo and band work. Not much pizazz. I see it was self-produced. Maybe Donald needs a better editor, a more critical voice in the process. I hope Fagen has one more album left in him of the quality of Aja or Two Against Nature or The Nightfly. Keep your ear to the ground and cross your fingers.
B000B5H7QO|4.0|For those looking for the facts. Mighty ReArranger 2 CD set was sold in France with a bonus disc of live tracks captured live at the Studio 104 of La Maison de Radio France on June 9, 2005. The show contains reworkings of the Led Zeppelin classics \\"Black Dog\\",\\"When The Levee Breaks\\", \\"Gallows Pole\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". The 2 CD set comes with a different colored CD inlay complete with picture sleeve and a stickered case. This set was put out in very limited release and it is believed that the album was pulled because Robert Plant incorrectly provides an introduction to a the song \\"All The Kings Horses\\" as a song that reviews Tony Blairs' progress with the war in Iraq. The song \\"Takamba\\" was in fact the song that he was speaking of. This album also includes the song \\"Freedom Fries\\" which is critical of of the climate in the USA after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  The track list is:    1. \\"Shine It All Around\\" [4:50]  2. \\"Black Dog\\" [5:03]  3. \\"Freedom Fries\\" [5:47]  4. \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" [6:28]  5. \\"All the King's Horses\\" [4:47]  6. \\"Takamba\\" [4:49]  7. \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" [6:28]  8. \\"Gallows Pole\\" [5:39]  9. \\"The Enchanter\\" [7:55]  10. \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" [5:43]  11. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" [10:31]    For more than two years Amazon.com has incorrectly provided an audio link on this page to a completely different album by a completely different artist.
193413712X|5.0|This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is one of the best books I've read in years. Slim at 191 pages, it is about the last eight days of dying clock repairman George Washington Crosby, whose hallucinating mind wanders across time in his final hours, stopping at disordered points in his life and that of his father.    The first novel by Harding, Tinkers was rejected by numerous publishers and sat in a drawer for several years before it found a home at Bellevue Literary Press, an obscure non-profit publisher based in New York's Bellevue Hospital. It's the first book from a small press to win the Pulitzer since John Kennedy Toole's [[ASIN:0802130208 A Confederacy of Dunces]] in 1981.    I don't often like awardbait -- difficult literary novels with spare plots seemingly tailored for award consideration -- but the language of Tinkers is as exquisite as a T.S. Eliot poem. Harding is at his most evocative when describing the workings of an antique clock or the natural wonder of the New England countryside, yet the entire book is written with an tinkerer's eye towards the world. There may never be a more eyebrow-curling description of halitosis than when George's father Howard pulls the tooth of a suffering hermit who buys from his tinker's wagon: \\"A breeze caught the hermit's breath and Howard gasped and saw visions of slaughter-houses and dead pets under porches.\\" When George witnesses his father's epileptic seizure at the dinner table on Christmas Day, it's a perfectly described moment of absolute terror -- and you can see why he's taking it to the grave.    At times, Tinkers wanders into pure existential reverie, like these thoughts from George's father as he drags his wagon of goods from one rural homestead to another:    \\"Your cold mornings are filled with the heartache about the fact that although we are not at ease in this world, it is all we have, that it is ours but that it is full of strife, so that all we can call our own is strife; but even that is better than nothing at all, isn't it? And as you split frost-laced wood with numb hands, rejoice that your uncertainty is God's will and His grace toward you and that that is beautiful, and part of a greater certainty, as your own father always said in his sermons to you at home. And as the ax bites into the wood, be comforted in the fact that the ache in your heart and the confusion in your soul means that you are still alive, still human, and still open to the beauty of the world, even though you have done nothing to deserve it. And when you resent the ache in your heart, remember: You will be dead and buried soon enough.\\"    I wasn't sure about this novel until I was 50 pages in, and even briefly considered abandoning it for fare more light than an old man's deathbed vigil. The cumulative impact of passage after passage like the above convinced me that Tinkers was a masterwork that would be cherished for generations, like a centuries-old grandfather clock.
B003JYOFIW|3.0|I'll cut to the chase as the reviews basically have already said what I think about the album.    The album has some fun, interesting music, but the music has been let down by a pervasive and horrible sound mastering habit; excessive dynamic range compression in an attempt to make the music sound LOUD.    The use of excessive dynamic range compression has negatively crippled the percussion and other elements that provide a clear rhythm to the tracks by compressing the transients of these elements out of the final sound, yielding a rather strained and fatiguing characteristic to the sound.    In a subjective sense, the sound can quite literally make you feel like you're aboard a 767 at about 35,000 feet.  You know, that sensation where the lower pressure feels like it's putting pressure in your ears and, sooner or later, you start to get a headache?  In the end, it makes you want to turn the sound DOWN.    An analysis of the tracks off of the CD reveals just what is going on; the waveforms have been maximized to the highest possible levels in the peaks and valleys.  This is a trademark of excessive dynamic range compression implemented in the mastering of the final mix for production of the album.  The resulting master lacks a balance in the sound; everything is strained to be loud rather than allowing all the elements to sound naturally loud and soft (dynamics).    It's a pity that Devo's comeback has been let down by sloppy engineering habits that have become the norm in the music industry these days.

B00275EHJG|5.0|I have been looking forward to a third installment in the Toy Story series ever since the second film came out. The first two films were funny, endearing, and original masterpieces, and I could only hope and pray that A. they would make a third, and that B. it would be at least half as good as the first two. Well bless those geniuses at Pixar, they went for a third movie with our favs from the toy box, and they gave us a film that can proudly stand alongside the first two. Some of the original toys are missing in this one, and a moment near the beginning settles the fate of those missing toys, but the main characters are here, and most of them are freaking now that Andy is about to start college. Gloom, doom and despair, they're headed for the attic, or worse, the land-fill. Due to a mix-up, the toys find themsleves donated to a day-care, which is what you would think that toys would consider heaven. It turns out to be just the opposite, and that's when the interesting stuff really starts. The pace is kept tight, with only a slight drag here and there, with lots of adult nods and winks, and laughs galore. The animation is superb, as is usual with Pixar. I am of the very firm opinion that Pixar is the real and true home of the computer animated film, and all others are just wanna-bees ( yes, even the Shrek series). How Pixar continues to turn out quality film after quality film each and every time is amazing. As I said, the pace is good, and gets more intense towards the end. Actually, I noted several people squirmed a bit in a key part in the land-fill, so the intensity was a bit surprising. However, the ending was pure magic. There is a fine line between heavy-handed sentimentality and pulling the heart strings enough to get a reaction, and Pixar has it down pat. The ending is just right, and leaves the door open for a possible fourth film (which would be GREAT). All in all, this movie kind of surprised me. I knew I'd like it, but it was better than it had to be. That's another thing Pixar is good at.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|this is a nice compilation, but what i'd really would have liked was the ORIGINAL music compilation of songs from the movie, as they were played in the movie. the edginess of \\"thriller\\", \\"smooth criminal\\", the prelude 2 \\"how u make me feel\\",  & all the others, were over the top FANTASTIC! is there any way i could ever get those songs as they were played n the movie?
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I am not going to account for taste regarding this musically enthralling album, but I will say you absolutely need to hear this on vinyl, and in a system worth hearing it through.  What once was muddled and confusing, is now utterly dynamic, alive and self-effacing.  It's going to take awhile for people to digest the greatness hear, musically and sonically.  Rocks in its own way.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Yes, this is a little bigger and clunkier than I like, but otherwise this is an amazing flash that is well worth the extra money compared to an SB-800.  My SB-800 is relegated to off-camera CLS slave duty only now due to its cumbersome mode change process.  Being able to switch in a second from TTL only, to master or to slave is ESSENTIAL for event photographers with quickly changing real-world situations.  I agree with others that Eneloop's do seem to delay the thermal warning significantly, so at least 2 pair is also a must.  The menu really is not that hard to figure out and gives you much more control than the SB-800.  If you're not that advanced and don't use CLS, then the SB-600 will probably do.  Otherwise, this is the most capable flash I have ever used.

B000286S8S|2.0|No Van Halen fan put this CD together. Yes, better organization of the songs would have helped it. Simply placing the selected songs in sequence would have been prefered, but the some of the selections suck too. There are plenty of hits on here, but there are some dogs as well (compared to other other songs they could have chosen).     I feel like Eddie had an obligation to the record company and did not fullfill it, so they delegated it to some intern who knew nothing about Van Halen to make a greatest hits. I could be totally wrong, but this is how the haphazard way in which the CD was put together makes me feel.    Van Halen is much too important (as a part of Rock history) to be treated this flipantly. Get this CD if you want to save on the download fees (it has approx 36 songs for $15). Delete the songs you don't want and resequence the rest. Don't expect this to be a great intro or overview to the band as you will walk away confused about the influence this band had on the 80's and 90's in American Rock.

B00006EXDM|5.0|\\"Hot Rocks\\" is ABKCO's answer to Capitol Records' Red and Blue Beatles compilations. This is a double album that contains the Rolling Stones' biggest hit singles (and a couple of better known album tracks)as released on Decca/London Records in the mid-to-late 1960s. There have been a lot of similar compilations before (\\"Green Grass and High Tides\\") and since (\\"Forty Licks\\")but this collection remains in print for several excellent reasons. First, the songs are presented in roughly chronological order. This makes very good sense to any listener as you can hear the Stones' sound develop. Second, these really are the very biggest hits the Stones had, and as evidence just look at any of their concert set lists to this day. Third, these are some of the very best rock songs recorded during the 1960s and as such this is not just one of the best British Invasion compilations, it is one of the best rock compilations of all time. This is a Greatest Hits collection of the type we really don't see much of anymore, what with current trends for boxed sets and newly-recorded \\"bonus tracks\\" that are often forgettable. For a lot of fans, this is the definitive Rolling Stones album.    The songs themselves need no introduction, and as some big tracks (\\"Honky Tonk Women\\" and \\"Jumpin Jack Flash\\") never made their way onto Stones albums of the period, this is the only way for you to get the original recordings unless you want to start venturing into other compilations.    If you want a slightly broader view of the Stones' glory days, you can also pick up \\"More Hot Rocks\\" as a companion volume as it has slightly lesser-known hits left over from this volume along with some rarities and some very early Chuck Berry covers and rewrites. Put the two collections together and you will have an excellent general overview of what the Stones are about and why they were such an exciting band. I just wish there were a post-ABKCO compilation that were put together as intelligently as this one.
B0035G5IOE|4.0|One of my favorite author's Roald Dahl has written books which not only appeal to children but adults as well. Books rarely get well adpated to the screen. In my opinion, this is a decent version and highly enjoyable for its animation.<br />Mr. Fox is a smart fox but careless. During a raid on a chicken farm, they get caught in a trap and Mrs. Fox makes his promise that he should give up this life of crime should they come out alive and also that she is pregnant. A couple of years go by and Mr. Fox has been domesticated and looking to upgrade in to better house. They buy this house in a tree and it is near the farms of Boggis, Bunce and Bean, three of the richest and meanest poultry farmers in the country. Mr. Fox is suddenly tempted and plans a heist with a opussum, Kylie and his own nephew. Once he is successful he raids the farm on a regular basis, the farmers upset band together and decide to get rid of the fox altogether. I loved this movie 4 stars 6/19/10

0152023984|5.0|This is one of my very favorite stories, especially in Kathryn Wood's lovely translation. It is a beautifully written piece of work about the world around us and offers insights into our inclination to letting the child inside ourselves be diminished by \\"reality\\" and \\"education.\\" The book starts out with a child, the protagonist, who is trained to behave in the way his elders do and to see the world in a way he is taught. Ultimately, his real adventure follows when, as a pilot, he sets down with a mechanical problem in the Sahara and encounters the little prince.<br />  It his interaction with the little prince that is the heart of the book. The child-like prince comes from some far away planet where things are quite different. What he proceeds to teach the protagonist is the simplicity and wonder that children and adults can experience in the world if they can access their inner child. I will not go into the conversations in depth which serve to reeducate the pilot but there is an especially moving passage that I love when the little prince tames a wild fox who comes along. It is a passage that brings tears to my eyes each time I read it. And read it I have. It is the one book in this world that I have read to my children, my grandchildren and just about every class I have taught whether it fit into the curriculum or now. It is a precious, valuable piece of literature. I heartily recommend it for all ages.
0446677450|1.0|Please do not waste your time with this poorly written fiction. Do you believe a 9 year old boy would say these words:   \\"So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an hour? That you're cheap and exploit your workers?\\"     \\"So what do we do? Not work for money until all traces of fear and greed are gone?\\"      \\"How does the desire form money affect our thinking?\\"    Of course not. If the author is lying so blatantly about this, you can expect more of the same. The book is poorly written, filled with typos and contradictions, and offers little real advice, and what he does offer is often misleading and inaccurate.    If you are still tempted to purchase, please do a web search on reviews and criticism of this book first.
B00138KKP8|4.0|I happen to be changing the channel on the tele. when I heard this awsome song! It was playing in the backround of a movie called,\\"She's the Man.\\" I thought, that is soooo lovely I gotta have it! I first looked under the movie soundtrack itself and it was not to be found. uggghhhh! I then thought ok, I will google it. Low and behold, I found this wonderful artist! When I heard his voice I thought this vocalist is one of a kind. I think of Natalie Merchant, or Sade. I think of Nora Jones and Bob Dylan. This I will share with friends and family and will keep my ear to the ground on this gem that I have found in this artist! I now love Ray Lamontagne!
B000JLPMPS|2.0|Let's get this out of the way: Eastwood's riff on the western is a great film, with fantastic characters, a great story, and beautiful cinematography.  But this transfer of it has a horrible brown sheen to it that doesn't ruin the experience but definitely doesn't justify buying it on blu-ray. I'm pretty sure the DVD I watched of it originally looked better than this transfer. If that doesn't bug you, fair enough, but buyer beware.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|A very outstanding film featuring an unlikely hero who is old and offers us many lessons about love, life, loss and heroes having clay feet. Some of the best movies in the film industry are being made by Pixar. In my opinion the first fifteen minutes of his life were fantastic and actually brought a lump to my throat such was the power of this animated movie. Some of the scenes other than the first fifteen minutes stay with you, such as the house's final resting place after the balloons have snapped- simply superb. Ed Asner who simply is Carl Fredricksen, Jordan Nagai as Russell and Christopher Plummer nailing the role of Charles Muntz.Four stars 6/18/10
0307594777|5.0|Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Bundle is one of the most compelling reading experiences I have had in my 74 years. I really like complicated thrillers and these books deliver big time. And I would wager that the plot is based on real events.

B003A4IFGY|1.0|Sorry, but not one memorable tune in the 15 songs, just put it in the marketplace to sell. Just not my cup of tea, I want petty songs that cheer me up.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|This is a great cd; especially if you came of age during the 60's & 70's.  Nothing beats the originals but this is as close as you can get.  Two thumbs up to both artists!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, Rocky and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room; the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!!
B000O5AYCA|3.0|I had heard the Alligator album before someone mentioned that I give the Boxer a listen. I love Alligator for so many reasons yet when I got ahold of the Boxer I felt it was music that had been stripped of its \\"edge\\".    Granted there are some beautiful, lovely songs on this album. I definatley will not be returning it to the CD Warehouse as used music. But, I miss the fun, the cocky attitude, the occasional yelling or strange back up vocals. I felt that The National probably has a lot of musical friends they could have tapped into... to really spice this album up. But I really feel this album is your favorite soda gone flat.    I enjoy it, but I dont LOVE it. It's not a total waste of money but dont expect anything too exciting or really seductive in the Boxer.
B001LF347E|5.0|This show is like a mesh of three of my favorite shows; Doctor Who, Robin Hood and the good bits of Smallville. It is engaging, imaginative and a wonderful take on the legend. I was skeptical when my friends told me to watch it, as a kid I read The Sword in the Stone, loved it and usually I hate it when people change stories, but Merlin had me at the end of the pilot. As the show builds so do the depth of the characters and it is fun, smart and never boring.
B000002WPH|3.0|Amazing album. Thought it would be awesome on vinyl... too bad its a pretty bad press, and lacks any kind of depth.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Best hard rock album of the year. Bonus if your a guitar player, but you do not need to be to enjoy this album.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I grew up with the original Toy Story movies, and now that I'm older, they still hold a special place in my heart. The 11 years was definitely worth the wait. This was an epic, and a great way to end the final story. Andy is going to college, and hasn't played with his toys in years. He plans on taking Woody, but leaving Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, the aliens, & Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head in the attic. When the toys are accidentally thrown in the trash, they decide to go to Sunnyside Daycare. They are greeted by Lots-o-Huggin' Bear, aka Lotso. When Woody escapes the daycare, he is found by Bonnie and taken to her house. When Woody learns of Lotso's past, he decides to go back, and help his friends break out and get back to Andy before he goes away. It becomes very emotional toward the end, that I cried. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend TOY STORY 3!!!
B000050FEN|5.0|I had seen this movie before but I recently ordered the two-DVD pkg.  It reminds me of Denzel Washington's \\"The Bone Collector\\" in terms of the special effects, the unfolding of serial murders and a surprise ending.  The second DVD had both a test-shot of the ending and then the story boards for an alternate ending that was never shot---I much prefered the alternate ending that was never shot---it would have been divine justice to have it end this way instead of the ending the director selected.  The casting for the movie was fantastic and Morgan Freeman is always great in any role he plays; Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey were wonderful in their roles.  If you love a good suspense movie with the police chasing a psychopathic serial killer you will enjoy this film.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|People need to settle down and realize that the issues (price changes and volume 2) have been or will be solved before the release.

B0030IIYYS|5.0|I was 9 years old when this was released, and I loved it and the original ever since. This sequel is just as good as the first. After Andy accidentally tears Woody's arm, Woody is forced to stay at home while Andy goes to Cowboy Camp. During a yard sale, Woody tries to save a fellow toy, and is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector named Al. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, and Rex go to Al's Toy Barn to try and save him. Woody meets up with Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Bullseye who tell him just how famous he is. Buzz and the gang must hurry before Al ships Woody's Roundup to Japan. I highly recommend TOY STORY 2!!!
B000QUU4OQ|2.0|Shakespeare in Love won a number of academy awards including Best Picture and I was really looking forward to viewing this DVD since I didn't see it when it played the movie theaters.  I expected much more than the film delivered.  I do not believe this movie reflects the talent and abilities of the actors cast to play in it.  My biggest problem was in the literary license of the screenwriter in his fabrication of the inspiration for Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare.    I bought the two movie DVD since I enjoy Gwyneth Paltrow and have seen her in some excellent films.  This version is not one of her best and my BBC versions of Emma are much better.  If I had it to do over, I would not have bought this double feature DVD.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I NEVER REVIEW MUSIC BECAUSE YOU NEED TO MAKE YOUR OWN OPINION OF MUSIC BUT>>><br /><br />This album is phenomenal. AT first i couldn't stand that \\"Dog Days are Over\\" song, but while listening to slacker.com (online radio) \\"Rabbit Heart\\" and \\"Kiss with a Fist\\" ran through the list and each time i heard it i said to myself..Oh this is pretty good who is it? and low and behold it was Florence and the Machine. Out of curiosity i bought the whole album and have been listening to it all weekend so far. Each song is better then the next. The songs are well written, the singer has a large vocal range, and there is array of instruments throughout the album. But dont take my word for it download a few songs for yourself and see if its your style ( i didn't think it was mine). I definitely look forward to more albums from Florence and the Machine.. but for now ill enjoy this one
0802136834|5.0|This is my first book from Alison Weir and I could not put it down!! It is so well written and easy to read. She makes sense of some confusing situations. This book is full of detail and I could not recommend it more! 5 stars for sure!!
B002M2N9JI|2.0|After hearing the buzz on LA ROUX some time ago, I picked up the album and have been listening to it periodically for the last few months. I have to say that I disagree with the highly positive reviews of the album. For starters, I think that Elly's voice is very uni-dimensional and uninspiring. There is nothing fresh or unique about her singing style, and her vocal range is average. The music itself has throwbacks to 80's electropop and new way, but it is surprisingly lifeless and bland. There are many artists doing this style of sound that I would recommend...UH HUH HER, MARINA AND THE DIAMONDS, and SOLID GOLD to name a few. LA ROUX's voice is not good enough  to make up for the lackluster music, and the lackluster music isn't strong enough to make up for her voice.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|The stage production of Mamma Mia is still touring the country and I am a big fan of Meryl Streep as an actress (and have always been surprised at how well she can sing).  This is one of the few films I have seen of hers in which she came across as not being really in the role and it being forced.  The singing of the ABBA hits, with a few exceptions, did not do justice to the songs.  The casting was wrong and it could have used a better director.  It didn't look as if the movie was filmed on location perhaps it was, but it seemed to me to be a low-cost production on a studio backlot.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|It's hard to believe but an animated film, featuring two robots as its centerpiece, is one of the best love stories of all time.  Wall-E simply captures and perfectly evokes the idea of love between two beings and shows both the sweetness and heartfelt emotion that are found in an ideal love story. The devotion that Wall-E shows to EVE and what she returns to him are among some of the most beautiful ever filmed.     The movie has a number of funny and downright hysterical parts to it and we even can see a number of aspects of screwball comedy in the story line. Wall-E, the lead character is simply put endearing and loving all at once. EVE plays the wise love interest which is a nice turn of events from traditional comedies.     All in all this is a great movie and if you have one spot on your shelf for a classic DVD, this is the one you need!

And when you resent the ache in your heart, remember: You will be dead and buried soon enough\\".<br /><br />With such a assured and poetic prose, Paul Harding's dreamy first novel, \\"Tinkers\\", is narrated. The tense shift from far past to present in the mind and life history of a dying man. We first meet George Washington Crosby in his dying bed, assisted by his wife and relatives, his sister, children and grandchildren. As he literally lays dying, his mind is melting, and reminisces, some real, others not so, come to his mind, as he recollects his childhood.<br /><br />Some motifs are recurrent - specially watches of many sorts. It feels like both narrators - there are some in this novel - and writer wishes to encapsulate time, what is not possible. Therefore, the watches are not metaphors, but also real objects accumulated throughout Crosby's life. \\"When his grandchildren had been little they had asked if they could hid inside [his grandfather's] clock. Now he wanted to gather them and open himself up and hid them among his ribs and faintly ticking heart\\".<br /><br />Sometimes, Harding's prose is like Faulkner's, poetic, sensitive and taking place inside the character's head, so that we could understand this character's heart and soul. The seems to be also a nice touch of Marilynne Robinson - specially of \\"Gilead\\" and \\"Home\\". But, on other times, the author's narrative is like a Terrence Malick film. Harding description of nature is like Malick's passion to film the natural world as it is. It is easy to get lost - and be found afterwards - in \\"Tinkers\\". Actually this is the biggest pleasure from this novel: to get lost in its prose, that seems to be set somewhere in the past, in this world where we live, or somewhere else.<br /><br />\\"Tinkers\\" received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction last April - which is a prize that this novel more than deservers. Its beautiful prose, and its serious meditations about life, death and memory are recurrent subjects in fiction. But rarely can a writer handle them so satisfactorily such as Harding. His perceptive combination of plot and language is a pleasure for the readers who expect for more than only a story from a novel.received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction last April - which is a prize that this novel more than deservers.

B0037W68F4|1.0|Not Oracular Spectacular (a truly great album front to back)...?  Ok, so what.  I'll live, no problem.  The real problem is that this album is awful.  So glad it leaked when it did as I was able to cancel my pre-order of the limited edition version.  So bad I don't even bother having a boot version.
0307474712|4.0|I'd never read a Nicholls book before, so wasn't sure what to expect.  But, I truly enjoyed this one. Here's the mostly ups and slight downs for this one for me:<br /><br />- Great writing done with an unusual approach that worked:<br />I loved the \\"slice of life\\" across the years approach, looking at the characters relationships on the same day of each year as their lives and relationships evolve. Combined with Nicholls gifted writing - it swept me into their world, and I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />- The characters are entirely believable and for the most part empathetic and likable:<br />While on occassion I found myself wincing at some of their choices, I genuinely cared throughout about Emma and Dex, and if they'd ever find themselves well enough to truly find happiness. I particularly loved Emma's wry approach.<br /><br />- There's a bit of what seems like a little \\"emotional blackmailing\\" thrown in. Though I'd read that it was a romantic comedy in a magazine article that lead me to purchase it, it's not that. It is a story of best friends and their relationships evolution similar to \\"When Harry Met Sally\\". But, beyond that, it's written much more seriously and takes a turn, that makes it more in the vein of a more heart tugging romance like [[ASIN:B002FID3M2 The Bridges of Madison County (Hardcover)]] or [[ASIN:0061187895 The Post-Birthday World: A Novel (P.S.)]]. Neither the tale nor the ending are romantic comedy fare.<br /><br />- A nice blast through the past<br />As a middle-ager myself, the books tromp through the late 80's to the present as their lives unfold was not only relatable, but a nice nostalgic journey, even though it's setting and characters are entirely British.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A delightfully well-written, heart-string tugging tale of two people trying to find themselves and each other that middle-ager women will enjoy - particularly if they're a fan of Nicholas Sparks, Lionel Shriver or Waller type romances.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Watching TS3 the day it premiered, I realized that Pixar has become the greatest movie studio of all time. Don't get me wrong, I always considered it one of the best but I want it to see how they will manage a second sequel of a beloved franchise? Well, they manage it brilliantly and TS3 has become a crowning achievement in Pixar's great catalogue. So far has been 11/11. Perfect in every way.<br /><br />TS3 reunites us with our favorites toys and they haven't age one day. But in reality Andy has and now they face a grim prospect of being neglected or worse, destroyed. I won't give any plot detalis but let me tell you that this movie make me cry. And I never cry in a picture. Never!! Not even in Up in that wonderful beginning, but TS3 did it. The ending is bittersweet and beautiful at the same time. Needless to say the animation is superb, the cast is awesome and the story is excellent. I feel sorry for How to Train Your Dragon because it is a terrific film but can't compare to TS3. It's 2010 best film . Thank you Pixar and thank you Woody, Buzz and the others for once again making us live a wonderful experience. Congratulations.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Now released on Blu-Ray, TS3 is nothing short of fantastic in this set. Picture is completely demo-quality with vibrant colors, sharo detail and lush animation. An amazing transfer.<br /><br />Likewise, the 7.1 DTS-HD MA will rock your house. It envelops you and completely blows you away with the level of clarity that it has.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />This is a 2-Disc BD set that is choked full of bonus material.

B003NTSBUG|2.0|Slow pace, confusing dialog and just so-so acting made this movie a complete bore for me.  I found myself wandering around the kitchen getting snacks, playing with the dogs and almost falling asleep on the couch.  None of those are good signs of a great movie.  I loved the preview, but most of the best stuff I had already seen from that.  Even the surprise ending didn't help.  I just sat there saying to myself \\"Really?\\".
B0036EBARO|1.0|Long time fan (not just a naysayer).  This album with the exception of one track just doesn't grab.  Goldfrapp are slowly losing all of their sophisticated arrangements leaving them to sound like well, just glossy metronomic fluff.  Gone are the changing and complex elements (esp. rhythms) replaced with the yawny same same dreck as any tired pap on the radio.  I like the whole bringing back the Trapper Keeper cheese aesthetic of a bygone era but the music makes no great argument.  Reminds me of the pathetic results of Madonna's being influenced by Bjork.  A flacid joke.
B000MV9026|5.0|I was 14 or 15 when I first saw this movie and loved it. I found it funny and enjoyable hearing the penguans sing edited versions of songs that I always listened to or found familiar. My favorites were the Kiss, boogie wonderland, and the stevie wonder song near the end. I loved the dancing too (I'm a lover of music and dances). They did some wonderful choreography for these scenes. I expecially liked the credits when they play Song of The Heart by Prince (I MP3'ed that). I actually liked the messages of the movie. the thing about being different from others in society is one. Mumbo is ridiculed for being different which can be reflected in our own societies. The humans are ruining the earth thing was good because in reality its true. Someone said that its overboard because it gives humans few redeeming qualities, but I have to disagree because when you think of what goes on in the world humans do have few redeeming qualities in terms of nature. Now theres one thing I have to agree with though -snicker- some of this is a little too adult for the little ones. I don't think its too serious though because theres worse things on tv and in real life. I know when I was little alot of stuff went over my head. I knew when I saw this in theatres there would be some parents out there getting thier panties in a bunch over the Prince, Boy II Men, and Color me Bad songs. I'm 19 now and still enjoy the heck out of this movie<3
030726999X|4.0|I was a fan of this entire trilogy, but it seems that, as an author, Stieg Larsson had a hard time getting a story going at the front end of his books.  This one, as with the other two, was, in my opinion, a slow starter.  But he does tend to finish strongly, compelling the reader to finally keep turning pages.  This one was no different.  Enough interest at the beginning to keep going, but certainly not so much that it's not hard to put down and go do something else for a while.  In the end he came up with a solid story.  It just took some perseverance to get there.
0385733577|4.0|When I first stumbled upon this series, I immediately thought about the Harry Potter series & dismissed it as yet another series trying to cash in on the whole HP craze. Years later I finally picked up a copy of the first book & I have to admit, I unfairly judged it. While the author was probably inspired by the Harry Potter series, this is a wonderful book in its own right.<br /><br />Twins Josh & Sophie spend their days working for the Flemings in their shops, never thinking that there would be anything out of the ordinary about these two people. When Nick Fleming gets attacked by some beings that couldn't- SHOULDN'T exist, the twins find themselves getting drawn into a story far older than they are, one that they are unable to avoid.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book- it's been a while since I picked up a YA fantasy & just couldn't wait to dive into the next book. (Well, ever since Holly Black's fairy series ended, anyway.) I loved how the author really did his research on the characters for the books & I also liked how he tried to stick as closely to the original stories & legends about the mythological creatures he included.<br /><br />This might not be as good as some of the other books I've read, but it is a very decent book. The only gripe that I really had with the book is that towards the end the action seemed to be very rushed. While I understand that it is an action scene, it just felt like it could have been a little more fleshed out.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed this book & I'm eager to start on the next one in the series. Hopefully if it is just as good as the first, I'll find a new series to adore!
B00005OWEG|5.0|In my opinion, 'Redux' will simply re-inforce what you thought of the original film. 'Apocalypse Now' is a polarising movie, and has its fair share of nay-sayers who think it's too long and too unfocussed. So if you didn't like the original, I doubt an extra hour or so of new footage is going to convince you. But for those who regard the original as a slightly flawed masterpiece (like me), 'Redux' is fantastic. It's not just that there are two long-awaited extended set pieces (the rendezvous with the Bunnies and the French Plantation scene), there are also a host of shorter scenes that really flesh out the story. So despite being much longer, `Redux' actually flows a lot better than the original.    The added scenes also provide several important character moments. Chief in particular gets some defining scenes (in particular the funeral for Clean, but also various short conversations with Willard) and there's also more of fan-favourite Killgore. I was particularly pleased to see a greater focus on Kurtz as well, and the more detailed exploration of his ideas gives Marlon Brando's eccentric performance a context that it didn't necessarily have in the original.      For me, the big thing `Redux' reinforces is how groundbreaking `Apocalypse Now' really was. Its nightmarish realism and moral ambiguity weren't always appreciated at the time, but its influence can be clearly seen in many later war films such as `Full Metal Jacket' or `Saving Private Ryan'.     Leave aside your cynicism about profit-driven Director's Cuts and \\"Definitive Versions\\", `Redux' is the real deal. New footage plus a subtle change in perspective makes this the definitive version of `Apocalypse Now'. While it probably won't do anything to convince the doubters, I strongly recommend newcomers and fans of the original seek this out. Five stars.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|We preordered this for our 7yr.old grandson who is fascinated by all things animal,planet, and storms. I don't know who enjoyed it more, him or us. He will watch it MANY times and be fascinated each time.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The book was fantastic and the movie hasn't disgraced the book - a rarity for the book-to-movie transition.  The story remains intact in the movie.  The acting is fabulous, as would be expected from this cast, even the young actor playing the young Michael Berg.  But I think what the real treasure is in this movie is that the depth of the book transitioned well onto the silver screen.  I don't think that most people who read the book and enjoyed it will be disappointed with this movie.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|2009's &#34;The Proposal&#34; features Sandra Bullock as Margaret Tate, the inconsiderate and career-driven senior editor of a New York City publishing house. When the Canadian-born Margaret is suddenly faced with deportation for lack of a visa, she announces a surpise engagement to her much put-upon executive assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds). The price of Andrew's cooperation is a promotion and a weekend with his family in his hometown of Sitka, Alaska.<br /><br />What could easily have been a formulaic romantic comedy becomes highly entertaining, thanks to the excellent on-screen chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Their verbal sparring is only one highlight of Margaret's hilarious &#34;fish out of water&#34; weekend in Alaska. Margaret will discover that Andrew has a tight-knit if tumultuous family (Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenbergen, and the scene-stealing Betty White), an attractive ex-girlfriend (Malin Ackerman), and surprising depth of character. Offered the opportunity for a quick family wedding, Margaret will suffer a sudden and fateful attack of conscience.<br /><br />Massachusetts is a somewhat less than convincing stand-in for Alaska, but the writers work in some appropriate jokes about the long summer days, convoluted transportation, and the hazards of being a small dog in Alaska. The story pacing allows Margaret and Andrew to discover each other, but not too fast, while working through such challenges as ad-libbing their marriage proposal story on the fly for Andrew's family and friends.<br /><br />&#34;The Proposal&#34; is highly recommended as good fun for romantic comedy fans. This reviewer hopes Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds get another outing together.
B000BJV3E2|5.0|Catch-22 presents an unsentimental vision of war, without romantic pretenses, glory, and honor. Instead, we find a nightmarish comedy of violence, bureaucracy, and paradoxical madness. The story is told as a series of loosely related mini-stories in no particular order. Leadership continually raises the number of missions required for the men to go home - it makes the leaders look good. The leaders pay more attention to the quality of aerial bombing photographs than the actual bombing results.<br /><br />The M.D., counselor, and chaplain values each become subverted by their war duties. The doctor ends up providing useless treatments, the counselor unavailable for appointments, and the chaplain loses faith in god. All three are rewarded by the hierarchy, and none are punished.<br /><br />Yossarian, the central figure, focuses on his own survival, faking various illnesses and troubled by the death of Snowden who had died in his arms on a bombing run. Yossarian discovers its possible to be discharged because of insanity, only to also learn that by claiming to be insane one has proven himself sane. That's 'Catch-22.'<br /><br />Meanwhile, mess officer Milo Minderbinder gets fabulously rich through trading by his various companies, including at one point with the Germans who subcontract with him to conduct a bombing run on the American base. Eventually, Yossarian goes AWOL, is offered a court-martial or discharge - the latter if he supports the leaders' new mandate for 80 millions. Yossarian avoids the moral temptation by fleeing to Sweden.<br /><br />Only someone who had spent combat time in the military could write with such devastating irony - a great book!
B00008976Y|3.0|Julie Vignon - de Courcy a young Frenchwoman (Juliette Binoche) is involved in an accident that will set her on a journey self-discovery. We go along with her and imaging what we would have done.<br /><br />This is a good film with a message. It is blurred by the attempt to introduce too many details that are trying to reflect ideas that could have been left out or explained strait forward.  The lack of direct information and many of the modifications from the screenplay makes this an average rated film.<br /><br />I believe that this film requires a common knowlege the writer and a film genera that I am not familiar with so the target audience may be restricted.<br /><br />One plus is the Cinematography of Slawomir Idziak that will really come to life in the film  GATTACA (1997).<br /><br />The film finally comes alive and what on the surface seems a musical downer of a depressed person in a depressed world can come alive for us if we listen to the voice over interpretation first. The version I have is the Criterion version so I am not sure that other versions have the voice over with Annette Insore.

B000NVL9KG|4.0|The reviews are many and mixed but what is Tarkus all about? First, no educated person would say \\"what is this Symphony No-9 of Beethoven, it's full of squeaky noisy sporadic sounds that go from a whisper then thunder and the only creditable piece is the song Ode To Joy.\\" This personality trait was nicely ridiculed in the 1969 film The Magic Christian where Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr are cutting the noises' out of priceless paintings and reply; \\"If you see any more good noses' around just let us know!\\" Tarkus is a `Work Album' and not a song by song piece. Listen to the first piece which includes \\"Stones Of Years\\" and take note. If you still are having trouble getting your head around the work Tarkus by ELP, then just drop the comments and leave it to others better qualified.<br /><br />Now About: What Happen To The K2-HD 24bit Remasters?<br /><br />For all who are wondering what happen to the K2 HD remastered 35th Anniversary reissues of ELP, Look for Amazon, ASIN: B000AMZ1ZW, it is the UPC:4988002489879 for Tarkus; K2-HD, 35th Anniversary Remaster, Japan-Victor 9/28/2005<br /><br />I consider the Limited Edition, K2-HD 24bit Digital Remaster's to be one of the best series to date.<br /><br />Why so many versions? The answer isn't that Keith Emerson, Lake and Palmer (or others) are out to build a massive retirement fund. Technology has vastly improved and the quest for that perfect remastered reissue prevails. Sometimes, a remastering house project may fall short of expectations and the artist may need to shop around again for a better manufacturer for his work. Sometimes it involves record label contracts and the need to wait-out the contract in order to get it remastered by someone else.<br /><br />Either way, the effort of most to remaster ones life's work is more about quality, not quantity.<br /><br />See Album Details at: amazon.ca (and) amazon.co.jp<br />UPC Database Lookup: [...]

0894803123|5.0|This ice-cream is AWESOME!!!!!!!  It was the best I ever had in my life, until we recently had home-made ice-cream at a shop in Colorado Springs, where they apparently use the same process but have perfected all the awesome candy/cookie/goodie combinations that I haven't had the time to yet!  But I digress.  Whenever I serve this to friends they say the same thing - the best ice-cream they've ever had.  Just about every recipe is a winner - french vanilla, oreo mint, peanut butter cup, mmmmm.  A friend requested peanut butter banana and the texture was a little strange, but even B&J mentioned that the &#34;health food types&#34; always request that kind, and what kind of a texture would you expect from PB & banana?  I look forward to making this ice-cream for the rest of my life.  Pair it up with a kitchenaid ice-cream maker attachment or whatever kind you prefer, and you are set.  You will (rarely) buy store-bought ice-cream again.  I eat this in little tiny bowls, usually just one scoop because it is so rich.  Just substitute egg-beaters for the eggs (they weren't so concerned about salmonella when this book was published), and remember their rule of thumb...there's not such thing as bad ice-cream!!  Especially when you're using the recipes from this fantastic book.<br /><br />Oh, and it's funny and entertaining too :)<br /><br />Update:  I've now made every single recipe from the book, and can say with complete enthusiasm that I still love this book just as much as when I bought it five or six years ago.  You'll have your favorite flavors based on your own personal taste, but these are pretty much all winners.  Well, with the exception of the canteloupe ice cream (unless someone out there liked that...I'd love to hear feedback :)  25 of the ice cream flavors ended up being &#34;keepers&#34; in our house, but we really enjoyed trying all of them.  The sundae combinations, dessert sauces like hot fudge and butterscotch sauce, ice cream cakes, brownies etc. in the back section of the book are also very good.  You can't go wrong with this book as long as you don't mind likely subbing out for the raw eggs.  Other options that I now do, besides sometimes using eggbeaters, are to use pasteurized eggs (the Davidson's brand is sold at our local Sprouts Farmers Market and Vons grocery stores) or just making a custard-base from another ice cream book and using the mix-ins from this book.  You can also leave out the eggs, but the ice cream won't taste quite as good.  Happy churning!ook are also very good.

B001Q94TQA|5.0|Everything ok. The movie came fast and it's one of the best I've ever watched. Hollywood should look at this kind of film and redefine its concepts.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Excellent movie and story line.  The filmography is outstanding.  It's a movie you'll watch more than once so it's worth buying!
0449208109|5.0|Other reviewers have given excellent synopses, so as someone who has lived in Nigeria, I'll just give an opinion.  This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand how life was and to a great degree still is, in rural Nigeria.  It is wonderfully written, stark, brutally honest and making no excuses because that is how life is.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Simply one of the best albums I have watched/listened - each time I play it I like it better.  Totally entertaining. Tender and rich in words and tone - tears spring forth - what a catharsis!      I have only now discovered Leonard in this magnificent recording - my wife has known him from his shows and early days in Montreal -     The music, words, and audience ambiance brings a magical luster and brilliance to this heartfelt performance.    Highly recommended and Greatly appreciated!    Thank you Mr Cohen!
B002UXRGLG|4.0|Although Life is really nice, it's not as epic as the Planet Earth series.  Also the one I got was not HD.  And that helps a lot.  Go for the BBC version or you will have to listen to Oprah.  Shes not a bad person, but her voice has a monotone and nasal quality to it.      Also it has a lot of repeat material.  Like an overview and then a a recap of the overview with a lot of stuff.  So it felt as if you were watching a greater majority of the material twice.  Although it comes in 4 disks it could have been done in 2 to 3.      It follows much of the same format as The Planet Earth series in the intro, story, and how it was filmed.  It is good stuff, but if you have not watched the Planet Earth Series yet I cannot say enough about how good it really is.  And if you liked this one, although they are not in competition, Planet Earth blows this one away.    Good hunting.
0529064847|3.0|Content is great, but it should be a pleasure to pick up and read.  Unfortunately, the print is so small that it discourages me from reading it.    The study notes are an even smaller print.
1407109421|3.0|I'll go ahead and admit my bias - I'm not a great reader of epics or sci-fi, so this series must be pretty great for me to have finished it at all.  I loved Pullman's descriptions of the worlds he creates and of the minds of the pre-teen protagonists.  However, I felt it was exceedingly dark during Lyra's time in the land of the dead and I just skimmed and skimmed until she could get through.  I liked that the ending was not a comfortable wrap up of all the loose ends of the story, but some of this I found just too weird and dark for my taste.  I guess that I read to escape and would have liked less of a real world experience and more of a naive fictional one.
159448385X|3.0|Khalid Hosseini's A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS isn't a bad novel by any means, and it remains fairly engrossing despite the predictability of its outcome; yet its popularity seems to stem mostly from the fact that it plucks any number of familiar notes international readers seem to want to hear. The follow-up to Hosseini's equally insanely popular THE KITE RUNNER, this novel tells the story of two women--Mariam, born in 1959, and Laila born twenty years later during the Soviet invasion--in Afghanistan, particularly during the governmental instability and wars of the last thirty years. Mariam is born the illegitimate and hidden daughter of a wealthy Herat cinema owner, and is married by her family to a poor Kabul shoemaker to keep her away from them; Laila lives near Mariam, the bourgeois daughter of a teacher forced to work for the state after the Societ takeover. Eventually the two women are forced by some pretty unlikely circumstances into having much more in common than either might have expected. Everything seems pretty much set up like clockwork and you can predict many of the supposed surprises of fate from miles away: big plans to escape bad circumstances almost always end in disaster, and you sometimes see drama coming from  miles away (the locking up of Laila's second child Zalmai in his room before the novel's big climax to ensure he can have a relatively untortured relationship to its survivors is just one of the many contrivances that gives far too much away). Laila and her monopedal dreamboat childhood sweetheart Tariq seem fairly flat and unsurprising; Hosseini fares much better with the long-faced, long-suffering Mariam and her initial portrayal of her husband Rasheed (who becomes too much of a stereotypical unredeemable brute as the novel progresses). The portrait of life under the Soviet puppet regime, the warlords, and (particularly) the Taliban are the most exceptional things in the novel, and does much to alleviate the clockwork predictability of thecharacter drama.

B003KRJNBW|5.0|Spectacular! Beals and Washington perform excellent roles as well as many other of the well-known actors in the film. Definitely one to rent. It has a couple nice twists in the end concerning the book and Washington, himself...two things that may surprise you. Not a film for the youngsters due to the killing but well-played for the purpose defined behind what Washington's quest is in protecting \\"the book.\\" The story is compelling as well as intriguing. A must see!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This is a well written, serious book. Max really compels someone to doubt the accepted fact that zombies are a physical improbability. The only reason this didn't get the 5th star is the inconsistency in describing zombie's. For example Max stated that only one in four zombies are able to use a ladder yet in general rules of escape over water he tells people to watch they're anchor line, if very few zombies are able to climb a ladder wouldn't none be able to climb an anchor?
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is one of the best mystery/thriller trilogies I've ever read, even though it takes place in unfamiliar international locales (which is generally enough to motivate me to skip over a book).  The characters are all well-drawn -- and have been from the very beginning -- and the suspense is palpable from the first page.  The main character is uncommonly unique in comparison to all other fictional female heroines (not sure that label really applies to her), supremely human, with flaws and baggage enough for three people -- but you are ultimately drawn to her, nonetheless.  Her cyber cohorts are always there to help, in devious and interesting ways, and though she never looks for (and claims she doesn't want) help, she maintains a loyal group of supporters who know what she's gone through and are determined to clear her of a myriad of false charges, while at the same time helping her to slowly heal some massive psychological wounds.  The pace is fast, the action non-stop, and the story wild but plausible.  My only regret?  I'd love to see a relationship, other than pure friendship, evolve between her and her most loyal supporter...whose door she knocks on at the very end.  Superb series; Mr. Larsson could teach a few mystery writers a thing or two about how to craft superior thrillers...he's one of the best there is!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is extremlly compelling. Use of dramatic atmosphere, frantic action, human struggles. Max uses all of these. You might expect something like this to feel schicophrenic and thinly spread but it all blends seemlessly together.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I was not very thrilled about listening to this album, being that it was her least succesful of her career and was it bashed by critics, but nonetheless i slipped the cd in my cd player thinking it would be a mediocre attempt and i could hopefully squeeze out at least 3 songs to put on my iPod. I had heard  the opening track \\"American Life\\" before and i was not impressed one bit, but listening to it on my cd player, in complete silence and away from the world, i really had a chance to listen and appreciate the lyrics and take in the ecclectic sounds, they were both very expressive and thought provokingly raw, by the second track \\"Hollywood\\" i was already hooked, and i could tell this album was not going to be any slump of any kind    Right behind Confessions on the Dancefloor, American Life has become my second favorite Madonna album of all time, It's a mixture of mature intense reflective ballads, and eccentric electronica songs that go down your ears like nothing before. Lyrically it's one of Madonna's best album, the rawness and the intelligence of it just hits you and holds on to you.    Get this album, It's Madonna at her intimate best.

B000F7CMRM|5.0|Stephen Gaghan wrote and directed this film,using Bob Baeur's book ,See No Evil,(based on his time as a CIA agent) as a leaping off point.The screenplay is what drew the cast of major actors.Gaghan wrote the script for Traffic. It's a densely plotted,highly-wrought work,sometimes obscure,drip-feeding you vast amounts ofinformation, in a series of short 1-1.5 minute scenes and a large cast of characters, simultantaneously,all over the world.Sometimes it's hard to glean what is being said and who is saying it and why they are saying it.I resented this obstacle to understanding, and you need to watch the film very closely.The thesis of Syriana is the system is wrong,people, governments,individuals are caught up in it.Big Business,corporations run the show.The rat race for control of Persian Gulf oil by whatever means necessary determines who dominates the world. Government is controlled by underlying forces.Only repeated viewing uncovers how 5 different narrative strands come together in this intricate tale of corruption,greed and power.The minor roles are all excellent too.     George Clooney plays Bob Barnes as a fallen from grace CIA operative,overweight and bearded.He is the emotional heart and provides the momentum of the story.He is asked to stay `on message',is coming to the end of his active career and to get a desk job is being asked to go to Beirut and assassinate Prince Nasir.He is being cut loose. Jeffrey Wright plays Bennett Holiday,a lawyer investigating the merger of Connex and Killeen,'fixing' problems. This is a central role.Matt Damon plays an ambitious energy analyst,who through a personal tragedy becomes a financial consultant to Prince Nasir,assisting his revolutionary views for changes in the Arab world. Wassim(Munhir)a poor immigrant Pakistani worker,shows the Islamicisation of displaced youth,calling for the ultimate sacrifice.The Prince is involved with the Chinese and this sets off scenes of torture,murder, corruption, suicide, kidnap, betrayal.'Syriana' is the name given to an Americanised Middle East,manufacturing consent of the people and world powers to make life easier for elites.Possibly there is an element of conspiracy theories at work but the film is an eye-opener to many actualities and realities,forces at work in the world that ultimately warp and distort democracies of the free world.       This is a multi-perspectival ,multiplotted film of 87-90 scenes of various characters in the west and the Middle East,whose subject is oil and Big Business's desire to get its hands on this rapidly diminishing resource,the shadey deals,the mergers of oil companies,involving torture,the CIA,murder,extremes of poverty,spies,Islamist radicalization,corruption,immigrant labourers,Emirs,Princes,industrialists,politicos.The film is shot without any flourishes, on hand-held cameras and influences the energy with which such a vast subject is tackled.It's not a total success as it takes a gathering momentum of small scenes by ¾ of the film before you understand,but it's a significant film, which earned Clooney the best supporting actor Oscar.It contains elements of a thriller, but has no big action scenarios.The film challenges the audience to come to their own conclusions of what is going on.With climate change, issues of oil pollution and dwindling resources,this is no small feat in mainstream film.

0375851569|5.0|I bought this set in February of 2010, and the first reading did not go well.  The pictures were too unfamiliar for her, also there's a page in \\"Hop on Pop\\" where a tiger is biting a boy's toe, and another boy was biting the tiger's tail, that was the killer.  The tears started accompanied by a protest of \\"Me no like!\\".  I placed the book away but left the set in plain sight.    After 4 more months, she gave the books another try and they are now a huge hit.  They are requested day and night.    Having grown up on Dr. Seuss, and loving the word rhyming and patterns, I'm very pleased to share them with my daughter.

B00275EHJG|5.0|And I loved every minute of it.    Sequels are always a tricky business, and second sequels even moreso (it's become conventional wisdom that superhero franchises always derail with the third movie).  Pixar defied the curse with \\"Toy Story 2\\", which was better than the original - could they manage it again?  Indeed, they have.  Let us give no thought to the nightmare scenario where this film would have been made by Disney separate from Pixar, before Roy E. Disney (God rest his soul) thankfully saved the day.  Some spoilers follow.    Picking up eleven years after the original, Andy (voiced again by John Morris) is 17 and off to college, and the once plentiful band of toys in his room have been whittled down to a few favourites (conveniently corresponding to the main characters, plus three remaining plastic army men), who now await news of what is to become of them.  \\"Toy Story 2\\" ended with the band vowing to face the uncertain future with Andy, and now the moment of truth has arrived.  Through a variety of circumstances, the toys are separated from their owner, and arrive at Sunnyside Daycare, a place that promises the possibility of always having children to play with them.  It's ruled by the seemingly benevolent Lotso-Huggin'-Bear (Ned Beatty), assisted by Ken (Michael Keaton, genius), who immediately strikes a bond with one of Molly's old Barbie dolls (\\"The Little Mermaid\\"'s Jodi Benson).  Woody (Tom Hanks) alone doesn't like this new arrangement...and of course, there's a catch.    \\"Toy Story 3\\" is simultaneously the funniest of the three films, and the saddest.  On the former score, there's a certain zip and occasional innuendo to this one that wasn't really present in the previous two (shots of which in the trailers led to people worrying about the potential Shrekification of the franchise; that is not the case).  In particular, poor Ken is relentlessly mined for laughs - yet at the same time as he is skewered so thoroughly, he's also a genuine character, a feat one suspects most studios wouldn't bother with (Dreamworks certainly wouldn't).  Barbie, likewise, is a surprisingly strong character.  The core of the movie remains, of course, Woody and Buzz (Tim Allen; in something good for the first time in a while; as a big fan of \\"Home Improvement\\", it gladdens my heart), still as fast allies as ever, though time always tests their bond.  The big challenge of this particular film is the looming possibility of irrelevancy - witness the heart-tugging moment where we learn that Bo Peep, Woody's girlfriend from the first two films, is gone, probably never to be seen again.  It makes sense, but it still hurts.    A passel of new characters, apart from the aforementioned Lotso and Ken, are also introduced, and they are expertly juggled; they contribute to the setting, but are never allowed to completely take over the show from the characters we've followed from the first two films (I'd have liked to be more of the theatrical porcupine, personally; the triceratops was fun too).  There's many a franchise that could learn from this film how to handle new additions to old properties.  And especially important among the new additions is the new human character, Bonnie, a charming little girl who Woody temporarily resides with.  She's set up for an important role for the toys, and she comes across as completely worth of the responsibility that is eventually bestowed on her.    Bottom line:  On returning from the theatre, I immediately went to the closet and got out some of my old stuffed animals, who I hadn't seen in a few years.  This is a powerful movie about both nostalgia and facing tomorrow, and it's a lot of fun besides.  Don't miss it (and screw you, Armond White).
B002JCSWV6|5.0|The perfect choice for the charismatic and spiritually powerful Nelson Mandela was Morgan Freeman. Mandela has recently been freed from a hellish prison term of over 30 years and has won the popular vote for South Africa's presidency. Not everyone feels comfortable with this and the tension in the country is at its worst. Pondering the country's morale and hundreds of administrative matters, Mandela seizes a far fetched opportunity, but must enlist help. Matt Damon gives a hell of a performance as the captain of a soccer (football) team in South Africa, the Springboks, secretly tasked with the impossible dream of winning the World Cup! If that is not enough, he senses that failure would mean a lost opportunity for bringing a shattered nation together again.<br /><br />Freeman is indescribably incandescent in Mandela's humanity, the silent musings over problems, the undying strength and grace. The viewer can almost see mind gears churning toward resolution, as Freeman's emotions are palpable onscreen. Freeman's kinetics undeniably show compassion and caring for his people, black or white, rich or poor, gender and faith neutral...the kind of unconditional love that only sainted beings are historically ascribed. Please move over, Mother Teresa and Ghandhi...make room on the bench... for Mandela belongs in the highest altitude and this movie took him there! Thank you, Clint Eastwood (a director with the touch of light) for making this movie!<br /><br />Although the movie is about politics, freedom, love for our fellow man...it transcends every expectation. It is incendiary with historical accuracy...the movie presents an evocational powerhouse of drama, action, adrenaline rushes, and unabashed tears of pride and joy. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! you will be transformed!
B002NUULNG|4.0|First of all - props to Anchor Bay/Starz for bringing this title out at a very reasonable price. Most Anime Blu-Rays tend to retail at 2-3 times what a \\"hollywood\\" movie do (Bandai, I'm looking at you!) - Anchor Bay released this at a fraction of what a hollywood movie costs (it tends to go on sale often, but even at its retail price it's a great bargain!)<br /><br />On to the disc though.<br /><br />Ghost in the Shell - it seems to go along with Akira as most peoples' first introductions to anime and still stands up today as a great movie. I'm not so great at going into the plot points of movies, so I usually leave that to the other reviewers. Overall I still love this movie.<br /><br />Rather than a straight \\"clean up\\" on the movie, the creators went back and basically re-did a lot of it. This is done either by new computer drawn-animation (similar to Stand Alone Complex) or by adding CG. While the original does show its age in some of the CG used at the time, and it was nice to see that cleaned up with some modern graphics, I found the choices in switching animation styles throughout camera cuts to be odd. You'll see classic hand-drawn animation one second, then crisp computer-drawn animation the next, then CG models the next, then back to hand-drawn. They don't do a terrible job of pulling it off, but it's very obvious. The characters themselves \\"look\\" different from cut to cut, and while the CG looks great as a background it looks odd when the characters are CG models (everything looks very flat, almost amateurish but with very nice shading - hard to describe). I liked watching the 2.0 cut, but I still love the original.<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray itself:<br />Video was obviously very nice for the 2.0 version - everything was cleaned up nicely or recreated to give it a very crisp look. No flaws that I could notice.<br />Audio was also very good - if you have a nice audio system it'll make nice use of it!<br />Extras were perhaps the best part.. the original GitS movie! While quality isn't the greatest (I didn't notice much of a difference between the DVD release and this 1080i version), it's fantastic that they included it. Best part, it's cheaper to get this package than it is to buy GitS separately on DVD! Other extras were alright, but nothing outstanding.<br /><br />Overall a very nice bundle at a great price. Ghost in the Shell + Ghost in the Shell 2.0 with great video and audio. If you don't own GitS already, pick this one up! If you did and are curious to check out 2.0, it's cheap enough that you can buy the disc and not invest much money into it.<br /><br />To make it a 5 star disc, I would've liked to see some more effort put into 2.0 (the CG models were a bit \\"iffy\\", same goes for the blending of all 3 styles of animation), GitS (original) could have been cleaned up much nicer, and it would've been great to see some behind the scenes on the 2.0 version (maybe even an in-movie-experience letting you see both versions side by side?).t (I didn't notice much of a difference between the DVD release and this 1080i version), it's fantastic that they included it.

B001HN694K|5.0|Adored this movie! The film's premise is Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as a young woman of 19, on the verge of a serious life choice---whose only reprieve is the \\"deja vu\\" return down the rabbit hole to \\"Wonderland.\\" The viewer is visually stunned by the magical scenery in all its nightmarish luminescence. Tim Burton perfectly captures the balance between darkness and light...his characters creepily loveable, charming and magical. Alice has an opportunity for distraction and to save herself in both worlds, the real and dream worlds...but which is which and how are they conjoined? Gotta see the show for the outcome!!<br /><br />Johnny Depp is perfect as the Mad Hatter...doing his best to be consistent, a difficulty for someone enduring madness. He tries though.. betwixt his confusion, resignation, anxiety, loss, and disorientation. The hatter does indeed realize a noble calling as the aide to our young heroine, played beautifully by Wasikowska. He steps forward with courage when the situation demands and dances with jubilation (a cool street dance) as a tribute to success.<br /><br />My favorite character was Stephen Fry, as the eerily, smoky blue Cheshire cat. Fry definitely stole the spotlight with his \\"toothpaste ad marquee\\" grin, unshakable confidence, misty, ethereal presence...an utter delight! Disney on Acid? Maybe aptly described by another critic...but how sublime...a nightmare is not about Care Bears frolicking in the clover. Kudos to Helene Bonham Carter...she aced her role, and i enjoyed her outlandish performance, along with her evil sidekick, Stayne (Crispin Glover). Anne Hathaway did a decent job, yeah, maybe a wee bit restrained but it could have been the botox...Alan Rickman as the caterpillar was the all knowing \\"Yoda\\" of nightmares...his voice and cadence well suited for the role. Caps off to Tim Burton....a one of a kind director who made an unmistakable masterpiece! Thumbs way up!!!
B0028K3192|5.0|Maxwell is truly grown and sexy!Although I have been a fan of Maxwell's for a long time, I actually put him&every other artist,on the backburner for a while. When this CD came out, Michael had just passed away. I was so griefed and devastated. I only listened to Michael Jackson or J5 music for a while. When I was ready to listen to some other music, I got this CD. All can say is Wow! And I am happy that Maxwell is finally getting his due with the Grammy's and awards. He earned them. He should have gotten them sooner.  I love the new haircut! Looks very handsome, sexy and sort like a young Harry Belafonte.  I recently saw him and Jill scott this month in Dallas. I had never seen him in concert before. Saw Jill several times. It was the best concert I had ever been to! He puts a lot of energy into his concerts and really a great showstopper. The first 3 songs, I couldn't hear him due to all the blood curling screams. It was crazy for a minute!I paid out over $300 for floor seats. It was worth every dime! And I will go back to see him over and over!  I also got all his 3 prior CDS. I am listening to each one day by day. They are all great!  Thank you Mr.Rivera. Thank you for bringing us real R&B, Class&sexiness. Thanks for having high respect for women, in particular black women.Thank you! I hope some of the younger up and coming artists will see that real music&class wins out every time!Congratulations on all the sucess! Longtime coming, but there is a time for everything. Maxwells' time is Now!
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I have been a Harry Potter fan since the first book came out.  I try to make the opening day showing for every one of the movies.  I was proud to add this one to the collection and I will be very sorry when the series ends.  Also, I'm 65 years old so Harry talks to all generations.
0783231202|5.0|I bought this to replace VHS because this is a great movie,  with big name stars and director, but nobody's ever heard  of it. A gritty and compelling treatment of slave issues  in colonial America.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I fell asleep twice.  Seen the plot before and a lot better in other movies.  Dazzling effects, but too predictible and boring for me.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Much has been said regarding which is preferable, the \\"enhanced version\\" or the original unadulterated versions. Having waited a long time for the three season sets to come down to an affordable level I now fall solidly in the \\"enhanced version\\" camp!<br /><br />STAR TREK was singularly the program that sparked my interest in SciFi which continues to this day. While f/x are only part of the appeal in today's programming...a great story being first & foremost, I was very pleased to see the excellent updates presented in the original series. I had not realized the extent to which I have come to expect superior graphics until I started watching this season 1 updated version.  All that needs to be said regarding this is that Gene Roddenberry would in no way be disappointed or insulted by the enhanced versions of his still astounding creation.<br /><br />If you have doubts about purchasing the remasters...don't worry...they are superb.

B000002KDG|5.0|For Neil Young to release an LP with one side acoustic and the other electric made perfectly good sense. After all, his heavier masterpiece, Everybody Knows contained some slower folk-country songs and the gentle Gold Rush/Harvest had Southern Man and Alabama/Words, receptively. Bookending the album with two very different versions of the same song was simply brilliant. Here was a record that could be embraced by both halves of Young's fan base. I, along with many others find myself, in both camps. When I am listening to great country songs like Sail Away I think that I prefer Neil the folkie. And then that song ends and the Powderfinger begins. Um, perhaps I prefer the rocker with his distinctive guitar playing? Neil really is quite unique in the annals of popular music. He has maintained his musical integrity throughout five decades, while never hesitating, not always successfully, the urge to try something completely different. He is a country folk-rock composer and performer of the first rank - if he had never picked up an electric guitar or recorded or performed with Crazy Horse he would be up there with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen as one of the most influential of the genre. If we excise all of the acoustic songs from his discography he would be remembered as one of the great rockers. He is sensational as a live performer whether performing a repertoire that is solely acoustic (Massey Hall) or entirely electric (take your pick). He may have been voted \\"the world's worst guitarist), but I'd rather listen to his impassioned playing any day than endure Jeff Beck's technical perfection. (Actually, I have always liked Jeff. However, sometimes it does require a bit of an effort).<br /><br />Between January 1969 and July 1979 Neil Young released 11 albums. I would suggest that 8 of the 11 are tremendous, worthy of 4 or 5 stars. Rust Never Sleeps was a fitting and worthy conclusion to this amazing run.
1582701709|5.0|I saw the movie and purchased the book the following day (surprisingly, they're the same)....  anyway, this book is life changing, i have been using the law of attraction for the past 3 years, and my life had been changed upside down, i attracted the woman of my dream, my business is doing better than ever and i took on a huge client, which i had no chance of getting and everybody told me that my company is not \\"big enough\\" to get - and i did!!! i moved to the city and my life had really changed for the better - than - I've been through some tough times, just like anybody else, but i managed to pull it off by using the law of attraction, i kept imagining in my mind, over and over again - that my financial situation was getting better, i started telling my mom and dad how great i was doing, i honestly believed in it - 3 months later i was doing great again... it's amazing, one thing that happen that i will never forget, is that i wrote a not to myself, and all i written on it was $20,000, i put in under my keyboard and totally forgot about it, 2 months later i got 20K from a big client, when i moved out, i cleaned my desk - and there it was , the note... $20,000, that's all its said....    that being said...     the secret works on one other condition that they fail to describe in the book and the movie...  on certain things - you need to work hard, and use the secret to attract the things you want...    if i didn't bust my ass to get that client i would not have made that money, but - visualizing it and working on it, allowed me to attract it faster! -  which is the point of the book.    don't think that it's all about wishful thinking, think big, visualize, use the secret, and bust your ass to achieve your dreams , and they will come true...    Awesome book, 1000 stars, life changing!!!!
B0026J8LHM|4.0|DT is a great band. Their way of creating music (and arrangements) goes through phases. Sometimes it seems like the songs are created just for Portnoy's ego satisfaction -- example of this is on previous albuns, where a riff is repeated 30, sometimes up to 70 times so Portnoy can throw in all imaginable possibilities on how to play those measures. Other times, they create MUSIC.    This album falls in that MUSIC category. I think they are getting better and better, because I believe they are getting over the \\"look Mommy, I am the best player in the world\\" vibe. Just listen to the song \\"The Count of Tuscany\\" in this album. That music alone is worth the price for the whole album.    Another great change for the better: Paul Northfield. This guy KNOWS HOW TO MIX an album. It is just amazing how much difference one person can make. Listen to the snare drum - it is lower in volume now in the mix. The vocals sit perfectly with all other instruments now.    So why four stars instead of five? Well, there are a few songs that still reflect their old way of writing - the relentless riff/phrase repetitions -- but don't get me wrong, it is much better than previous releases.    Execution of the pieces is excellent as usual, they are masters of their instruments. This one is a keeper, and I have been listening to it almost every day for several months now.
B002UXRGM0|4.0|The video looks great with good commentary,  would have gotten 5 stars if not for the big and bulky packaging it came in along where you had to pull out disc one to get to disc 2.  Planet earth packaging was way nicer.  Also would have been nice if you could choose each different episode in from the menu instead of each disc being a 3 hour block.  These things might not even bother most people.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Interesting example of a film with a great plot, a great script, terrific acting . . . and yet terrible direction.<br /><br />I was only able to get through this film the second time round because of the director's exasperating obtrusiveness (e.g., hundreds of gratuitous CUs), but boy does it pack a punch, if you can look past that.  By the end of the film, the characters have been raked through the coals and the viewer feels he has gone on a meaningful, harrowing journey right along with them.  This was also a critics' favorite in the year it appeared.<br /><br />The plot concerns a man who attends a wedding only to find out that the bride is a daughter he hadn't even known he had.<br /><br />And as if the director's cold yet pretentious style isn't enough, you should in addition bring a barf bag:  the camera jerks around unnecessarily for two hours and fifteen minutes without relief.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|This movie came to me as a recommendation from a friend, that I hold in good stead..hmmm, not so sure I still hold him so dear.  Look, I liked the film on the whole, I mean I gave it three stars, but for some reason I was left thinking, uh was that it?..Was that the movie that got an Oscar nomination?  It had fine actors, starting with the great Alfred Molina and what a glorious treat to see Emma Thompson pop up, but the lead actress seemed at times the innocent and at times she acted like the 25 year old she actually is, it just made her seem unrealistic, especially when she dressing down her parents; I mean what girl in 1961 England would dare!! talk to her father so coursely?..I had not realized Peter Sarsgaard was in this, and let me state for the record that I can't look at him without thinking of Boys Don't Cry, a film he was revolting in, so let's just say I was not pleased to lay my eyes on him.  I have to admit he was game in this, and played the part quite well, though I never bought his charm for a minute, I kept thinking, why are her parents so enthralled with this loser, he was so obviously not what he seems.  I mean, couldnt the dad have hired a person to looking into who this 35 year old man actually was, instead of taking his 16!! year old daughters word for it?. What father allowes his 16 year old daughter to go to Paris!!! with a 35 year old man he barely knows?!!  At the beginning of the film her father is very autocratic and direct, but when Sarsgarrd arrives Molina becomes a stooge, a Beta male fool, it just didnt jive.  Yeah, the movie tries to make it look like Sarsgaard is charming and charismatic, but I never bought that the parents wouild have been so naive and frankly dumb.  Overall, the film just didnt work for me, but the acting is top notch, if that's any consolation.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version hit all the important plot elements of Jane Erye. They embellish a little here and there (as any movie would), but it doesn't matter because the characters of Jane and Mr. Rochester are so on point that when I re-read this book, I will envision Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre as Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. What thrilled me was how well they highlighted how far Mr. Rochester went out of his way to make Jane fall in love with him, which was so important to me. I was very impressed, as I have seen two not-so-stellar movie adaptations (actually they were awful). I realize that the movie would have to be this long to hit all the important points in the book, but it is totally worth the watch and I have a feeling I will be watching this movie over and over again. I love this story, and to finally see it come to life as it did (even the part with St. John) so beautifully and on point was actually wonderful.<br /><br />But what this version did so well that I haven't really seen in others was show how often Mr. Rochester dropped hints and played games with Jane's mind up until the proposal, as he had been seducing her ever since she arrived at Thornfield. He was very flirtatious with her in the book and justly so in the movie. Mrs. Fairfax was not lying when she said that he treated her like a little pet of his; that was obvious even when Blanche was there (and I wouldn't have been surprised if she picked up on it as well). My favorite scene was when Jane told him she was going to see her aunt, and the money debate began. In the book it doesn't happen in front of Blanche, but they definitely caught the lightheartedness of the matter and how \\"happy\\" he got around Jane (just as he did in the book). That was never in doubt in my interpretation of the book, but other movies seem to make it less obvious than it actually was. So this was a great version of the book.<br /><br />Note... I was so afraid that they had left the most important/my favorite part of the book out of the movie: the part after Jane discovers the secret but before she leaves Thornfield (the most passionate confrontation between the two main characters). I loved that part to death in the book, so I was almost highly disappointed. However, they don't leave it out... they just flashback to it and change it considerably (less conversation and much more kissing than in the novel), but they did it in a way that mimicked the passion of that scene, so I was satisfied. That's because the movie nicely morphed that passion into the bedroom scene after the near-wedding; I was satisfied (and awed). It worked even though I am surprised it did; I think that's because it did show Mr. Rochester's masculine intensity mixed with pain and Jane's weakness belying her strength. A different interpretation, but same passion. Like in one review I read, if there had been another four episodes, then they would have to be Mr. Rochester begging and seducing Jane to stay with him (as he did for forever in the book). This movie did a brilliant job of catching the passion of Mr. Rochester in ways that the other versions I have seen did not. Upon re-read of the book, you could see from the beginning that Mr. Rochester was completely falling head-over-heels in love with the woman and was setting her up big time, whereas in other movies he is so stone cold and callous and practically insanely brutal that he is so off-putting (which is not the vibe I got from him in the book at all). I got the right vibe of tortured and passion from Mr. Rochester in this movie, so I was very pleased. And Toby Stephens was wonderful. A little better looking than described in the novel (not his fault), but so on point in character.<br /><br />Note 2... There is no need to go into much detail about Ruth Wilson's portrayal of Jane: she was absolutely perfect. Look, demeanor, passion, youth, innocence, fire... she was Jane Eyre. She was so on point with all the emotions (or lack of control of them) that an 18/19 year old would feel, but had a maturity level that could only come from a tough and loveless upbringing, with a desire to love and be loved. Jane's role was so on point with the book, even with all the subtleties that I have not one complaint. She was not overacted or unrealistic; she was exactly how the book portrayed her. Even all the side characters were perfect, like Adele and Blanche Ingram.<br /><br />I am thrilled.
B003AO3CIK|5.0|I was lucky enough to grab this album on Record Store Day and, being a huge Nada Surf fan, I couldn't wait to give it a listen (which, side note, if you ever get the chance to see them in concert I recommend doing so as they are fantastic live).    I rarely enjoy cover albums as I generally just want to listen to the original song but almost all of these covers are so solid that I am able to see Nada Surf's version as a reimagining as opposed to a straight cover.     I have to say, this album is much much better than I'd thought it would be. While almost every song is fantastic, Love Goes On is definitely the standout track for me on this one.     Highly Recommended!
B001O22ELQ|1.0|I originally watched Dr Horrible in HD.  The quality of this movie if you watch it online is TERRIBLE.  On top of that, it was not made clear that I would have to download software (\\"Unbox\\"??) in order to view the movie.  I was going to buy this for my dad for Father's Day, but he doesn't like to download software to access media (he doesn't even have iTunes), so now I can't really send this to him, either.  When you see something that says you can download a movie, I should be able to download THE MOVIE, not some software that will allow me to view a low-res version.  I have a Mac, so I can't download the crappy software.  I will not be buying any movies through Amazon again.  Chances are, I won't be getting a refund either.    I think everyone should watch Dr Horrible, but don't use Amazon's service.  Buy it on DVD and have it mailed.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|When I got to the end of this movie I was relieved to realize that I'd actually seen something new in the Terminator series and not a simple re-hash of the other movies.  99% of this movie takes place post Judgment Day and concentrates on the rise of John Connor in the resistance and the first great victory against the machines.  This wasn't a movie where I was tempted to hit the fast forward button.  The action scenes are reasonably compact and progress the plot rather than simply being there for violence alone.  This movie leaves you with a feeling you have watched the foundation for at least one more Terminator movie, and if that is case I hope it retains the same actors and director as I liked the feeling of progression that you got from the story line here.      For me, Sam Worthington was a surprise. The only other movie I've seen him in is [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray]]] and this confirms that he has a steady screen presence good enough to hold up a full length movie without a tonne of cgi.  In all, I was glad I took the time to watch this installment of this series and it makes me hopeful for the next movie.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|The boys may be older but they are still \\"Hot Rockin!\\" I would have paid twice this, just for the DVD that comes with it. Halford is still belting it out.  Travis is simply amazing and well, what would Priest be without the boys, K.K. and Glenn who are both still a nice bit of eye candy. The energy and excitement caught by this show is infectious and you can't help but bang your head and sing along.  What would metal be if it hadn't been for \\"British Steel\\".....I shudder to think.  If you're a Priest fan, don't pass this up.  If you aren't a fan, watch this...you will be.
0307341550|5.0|Okay, a while back I bought Sharp Objects at a yard sale. It sat on my bookshelf for some time, until one day I picked it up, flipped through some pages and decided to read it. This book blew my mind!! I could not put it down! The twists and turns in this novel are epic and it gets even more sweeter towards the end. This is such a terrific novel I had to read it twice! And probably will again. Gillian Flynn is an amazing author. I can't wait to read her second book. The only regret that I have, is not picking this book up sooner!!
B002ZG997M|3.0|Good pacing and plenty of action is marred by an all to familiar post-apocalyptic landscape.  Dreary, with food and water shortages, gloomy colorless landscape, scavengers, cannibals, etc. The added twist is 'the book'.  Eli has it, others want it.  What is it???... see the movie, I'm not a spoiler.  You may or may not appreciate the impact of the book - I thought it was weak, even silly, and helped the ending fizzle to an unsatisfying yawn. Still, others may like it and consider it profound.  To each his own.

0307269752|4.0|Before you read this review, pour yourself a cup of coffee ...<br /><br />In this Swedish thriller Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist / magazine editor who has just lost a libel case under shadowy circumstances, is hired by multi-millionaire Henrik Vanger to investigate a decades old disappearance case of his niece Harriet.  Harriet vanished from a small island owned by the powerful Vanger family.<br /><br />Would you like another cup of coffee?<br /><br />Blomkvist teams with Lisbeth Salander, a young computer hacker with an amazing photographic memory and anti-social tendencies who...has a dragon tattoo.<br /><br />Let me put on another pot of coffee.<br /><br />This a strange book, the middle is fast paced and exciting as the investigation into Harriet's case evolves, even though I found it impossible to keep up with the various Vanger cousins and relatives (Blomkvist researches through a cover story of ghost writing Henrik Vanger's biography), the ending is a bit slow and takes a turn from a murder mystery to a financial takedown.<br /><br />Here, have another cup of coffee.<br /><br />The character of Lisbeth is drawn up very well, but Blomkvist is lacking some depth.  After 460 pages it's not clear whether Blomkvist actually cares about the women he sees or just resigned to his commitment issues, sure he's a nice guy - we've been told that by every woman he sleeps with.<br /><br />Another cup of coffee?<br /><br />Even though I don't understand what the title has anything to do with the book (besides the obvious, literal meaning - which in the context of the book is meaningless as well), I still liked it.  The story is well written and interesting; the characters are engaging and well drawn.  This is a good book and deserves praise.<br /><br />A note to acknowledge the fine translation by Reg Keeland, if you know him, buy him a cup of coffee from me.<br /><br />And if you didn't get it, everybody drinks coffee...or about to have a cup...or making coffee...or cleaning the coffee machine.  Literally every other page - I'm not exaggerating.<br />Personally, I thought it was hilarious.ersonally, I thought it was hilarious.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|First of all, I have to say that whatever you feel about his ideology, Michael Moore knows how to make good documentaries. Every frame offers a perfect conjunction of text and accompanying image. The documentary is as engaging as a good mystery film. This is simply very high-quality film-making.<br /><br />Most of the things Moore narrates are sadly familiar to all of us: foreclosures, businesses failing, unemployment, economically devastated areas that look worse than anything you can find in many third-world countries, the useless and horribly unfair bailouts, the back room deals by Paulson, Geithner, Bush and Co, Obama getting bought out by the same crowd of vile criminals the second he gets close to presidency. We have seen all this unfold, and it's impossible not to recognize that everything Moore shows is true. Many instances in the movie are touching and sad, while many others are hilarious (For example, Moore says after rereading the US Constitution: \\"The Constitution doesn't mention capitalism. But it does talk about 'welfare' and 'union'. Wait, welfare and union? That sound like a very different -ism!\\")<br /><br />Now, after all I have said in praise of Capitalism: A Love Story, I have to say that I disagree with Moore's central premise, which is capitalism is bad and it should be substituted by something better, namely democracy. I'm sure Moore understands extremely well that you can't substitute one with another since democracy is a political system and capitalism is an economic one. He uses the word \\"democracy\\" in order to avoid saying the word that scares the regular movie-going people, namely \\"socialism.\\"<br /><br />To support his view that socialism is better, Moore tells a story of a business owned by all its workers together. Every decision is made jointly by the workers in a democratic-style voting process. I'm glad this system works for the company Moore describes in the movie. However, this could never work on a larger scale. If anything, a smooth running of his business is a huge exception. I, for one, do not want to run my place of work. It's not my job and I don't want it to be my job. Some people are good at being managers, organizers, and the leaders of people. Other people are not. Working collectively on a shared project is an impossible burden for some people. There is no doubt in my mind that not having one actual owner will bankrupt an absolute majority of businesses very soon.<br /><br />The reality that Moore doesn't address is that the current economic system in the US is not really capitalist. In many ways, it is eerily similar to the Soviet economy. In the Soviet Union, huge amounts of government money would go to bail out companies that could not survive on their own. If there were a real capitalism in the US, Goldman Sachs would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. The way capitalism works is that if you are inept enough to bankrupt your company, you are pushed off the market by more capable competitors. Goldman Sachs has long been completely incapable of an honest win over anybody else. They are kept in place by a complex system of Soviet-style handouts. This is as contrary to capitalism as anything can possibly be.<br /><br />In spite of disagreeing with Moore's ideas, I'm giving the movie five stars simply because nobody makes documentaries of such a high quality as he does.ess is a huge exception.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|Quickie review of Something For Everybody, the first studio album from DEVO in 20 years     Cut 1 - Fresh. Hey, this sounds like Devo. Like one of their warning song. Freedom of Choice-ish. (Scale of 1 to 10, TEN being The 007 Theme and ONE being Afternoon Delight, I give this a FIVE)     Cut 2 - What We Do: Okay, we've heard the Devo song, now the confessional. With a Yeeeyowww Devo tells us to expect no more than what we have now 'cause it's only going to get worse. Pearl of wisdom \\"The lucky ones are gonna be the first to go.\\" Piercing perfection (NINE)     Cut 3 - Please Baby Please: But a Spudboy has to have luv, even during the apocalypse. Girl U Want meets Baby Doll. (SEVEN)     Cut 4 - Don't Shoot, I'm a Man: Devo industrial, nice beat but despite the promising title, lyrics are fairly vapid, I mean, \\"don't taze me bro'?\\". (SIX)     Cut 5 - Mind Games: Girl U Want meets Love Without Anger. Something about this `love song' makes me want to clear my throat. (And give it an EIGHT)      Cut 6 - Human Rocket: Rehash of Devo's Speed Racer, but with a good industrial beat. And yeah, it's about a penis. We get it. (SEVEN)     Cut 7 - Sumthin': A Devo fascist song. Thru Being Cool meets Beautiful World. Pearl of wisdom: \\"You spin the story and call me a liar?\\" (EIGHT)     Cut 8 - Step Up: A Devo Instructional. One cliche piled atop another, but is that a bad thing? (FIVE)     Cut 9 - Cameo: This tune sticks in your head like dog-doo sticks to your shoe, and that IS a bad thing. (TWO)     Cut 10 - Later Is Now: Sooner or later, everyone gets it right...but we're talking millennia. Optimistic? Yeah, if you're Cthulhu. (ONE to TEN? I refuse to play this game anymore)     Cut 11 - No Place Like Home: Devo and a piano?!? It's good to know the Spudboys, at least, have found peace in the knowledge that when humanity is gone the world will be a better place. (Move over Edward G. Robinson, I'm ready for that death clinic in Soylent Green now) (666).     Cut 12 - March On: Wait a minute. There's a war on. Grab a gun and do your duty. And  STOP all that whining. (SEVEN)     Now I'm going to listen to the CD again and look at the pretty pictures inside the jewel case before they are gone too.
B001FB55L2|4.0|The movie shows a scarily typical American family that is leading a completely vapid, senseless, emotionless existence. Their food, their clothes, their pastimes are drab and boring. They are incapable of any real, profound human emotion or any thought that rises above the purely mundane. The only way men in this family of sad, uneducated people can make a living are becoming a criminal or going into the military. When Sam, the responsible family man, is declared dead in action in Afghanistan, his widow Grace is kind of sad but not a whole lot. Sam's wayward brother Tommy starts hanging around, and Grace lets him occupy Sam's position in her life. She doesn't seem to care much one way or the other which one of the brothers repairs her kitchen,  plays with her daughters and engages in romantic interludes with her. Then Sam unexpectedly comes back, which is also kind of OK with the utterly vapid Grace, played convincingly by Natalie Portman, whose total lack of personality in real life suits this role perfectly.<br /><br />Sam, who has gone through hell in Afghanistan, feels that he cannot learn to reinscribe himself into this world of interchangeable wives, husbands, children, siblings, and friends. Everybody expects him to suck it up and resume the kind of existence he led before his horrible war experiences. However, Sam actually grew some personality during his captivity and torture. He is incapable of understanding this empty kind of life any more, let alone actually living it<br /><br />The powerful and painful message of this movie is that some people can only be shaken out of the stupor they live in by something as horrible as what Sam goes through in Afghanistan. At the end of the film, Sam goes into a psychiatric facility. Apparently, he will have to undergo therapy in order to be cured of his newly found humanity. Then, he can attempt to join the world of robots represented by his family members.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|If you've heard of Michael Burry, Steve Eisman, Charlie Ledley, Jamie Mai, or Ben Hockett, there may be something wrong with you. Knowing one or more of these characters might suggest you've spent far too much time on the fringes of Wall Street, because it's unlikely you would have encountered any of them unless you were tightly wrapped up in the subprime mortgage mess that practically overturned the global economy in 2008.<br /><br />It's these marginal players who populate the pages of Michael Lewis' masterful study of the decline and fall of Wall Street, not their much better-known counterparts who played such leading roles in making the mess that has been troubling us all ever since. This delightfully entertaining book explains how that handful of marginal actors in the financial markets anticipated the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and its dire consequences -- and walked away with tens of millions of dollars each while the rest of us were counting our losses.<br /><br />What a fascinating bunch of people they are! There's Michael Burry, a physician turned stock-picker with Asperger's Syndrome who found it exceedingly difficulty to interact with other people and supremely easy to focus on obscure details no one of sound mind would ever consider. And Steve Eisman, a Wall Street wizard with a genius for financial analysis and a seemingly boundless talent for pissing people off. And Jamie Mai and Charlie Ledley, who started off in a Berkeley basement with $110,000 and a vague notion that they could (perhaps, maybe) build their little nest-egg into something a little larger. Every one of these unlikely seers was absolutely right in calling the decline of the subprime market, years ahead of others who gained the attention of the news media. And, in Lewis' telling, every one of them greeted with astonishment the disbelief and ostracism they faced for their views.<br /><br />To the author, Michael Lewis, The Big Short is a sequel of sorts to his breakthrough 1989 bestseller, Liar's Poker, the first of his thirteen books, which was based on his eye-opening experiences at Salomon Brothers in the go-go years of Gordon Gekko. In an epilogue to The Big Short, recounting an awkward recent lunch with John Gutfreund, the disgraced former CEO of Salomon Brothers and Lewis' first boss  in the industry, Lewis finds the roots of the financial meltdown of 2008 in decisions Gutfreund made at Salomon in the 1980s.<br /><br />The Big Short is a joy to read because of Michael Lewis' easy way with words. It's also one of the most insightful of the many recent books that have examined the financial implosion, and unlike many of those other books, this one pulls no punches about who is to blame, and why they did what they did.<br /><br />(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)Poker, the first of his thirteen books, which was based on his eye-opening experiences at Salomon Brothers in the go-go years of Gordon Gekko.

B003A4IFGY|5.0|Best new CD I've purchased this year. Not a bad track on the entire album. Was disappointed in some of Petty's recent work, but he's back with a vengeance!
B001TODCII|5.0|This is a movie that shows how easy it is to victimize women but also what any person would go through to make sure they would do whatever they could if they had the experience and know how to make sure they would be able to get their own child back safely regardless of the obstacles that was in their way. This movie was ripped to shreds in Rotten Tomatoes - but if you are a parent - ask yourself one thing ------ WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO GET YOUR CHILD BACK BEFORE THEY DISAPPEARED FOREVER?<br /><br />Get this movie to see not just the action but to know just what one man would do to get his own daughter back. Its worth it!
B00321SMFO|5.0|This is a very informative and spectacular video. Make sure you watch it on a HDTV.
B000059MEK|5.0|this is a must have album if you are in to electronica/dance music. face to face is my favorite track, such a good beat and the vocals are awesome.
B0036EH3WU|1.0|EDIT: August 19, 2010  In the past 24 hours, there have been (5) reviews with a 5 star rating that all say about the same thing. 4 of those \\"reviews are 2-4 sentences long and the 5th is a short paragraph. Does that seem suspicious to anyone? Could there actually be a concerted effort to SELL this series to the unsuspecting Newcomer? My answer is MOST certainly there is a real SALES effort taking place. BE CAREFUL Newcomers. There are con-men roaming about \\"The Amazon\\".      \\"LOST\\" was never primarily about the characters. \\"LOST\\" was about the mysteries on and surrounding the Island. The characters played a SUPPORTING role for the mysterious Island, not the other way around.    Do you want to know some shows that were ALL ABOUT the characters? How about \\"Friends\\" or \\"Frazier\\"? In those shows, those characters did basically nothing and basically went nowhere. Those shows were ENTIRELY character driven.    I never saw MYSTERIES being introduced into those shows, but somehow some people have come to the conclusion that \\"LOST\\", with ALL of it's non-stop mysteries, was about the characters???? PLEASE!!!!!    If \\"LOST\\" was about the characters, then those characters were IDIOTS, because THEY BELIEVED that the MYSTERIES WERE IMPORTANT. Those characters spent their entire 6 seasons racing around to figure those mysteries out. WHAT FOOLS those characters were. They were even WORSE than the \\"average\\" viewer, because while we all THOUGHT that \\"LOST\\" was all about the mysteries, we were ONLY watching. Those MORON characters were actually ACTING as if the mysteries mattered. Just how DUMB could those characters be??????    And in the end, we find out that NOTHING MATTERED. No matter who did what to whom, they ALL end up bathing \\"in the light\\". Those characters NEVER had to do anything. They never had to fix anything. They never had to understand anything. In the end, EVERYONE ends up in the same place NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!    But the TRUTH is that \\"LOST\\" was ALWAYS about the MYSTERIES.    Now for the REAL story about Lost......    Lost is an incredibly interesting program with more mysteries and clues than you will know what to do with. Seriously, it's fun and amazing, at least at first.    But when it's all said and done and you get to the finale of season 6, it will be painfully obvious that you have been conned all along. 95% of the mysteries are never solved. They are completely ignored in the end.    For 6 years, the writers of Lost convinced the viewers to wait for the 6th season to have all of the many mysteries revealed in a cohesive story. They asked us to have FAITH.    When season 6 was over, 95% of the mysteries were left unsolved. That was the BETRAYAL.    What other TV series strung the audience along for so long without answering questions from seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 simply by promising to deliver in season 6 and then simply ignoring 95% of those questions in the end?    One 5 star reviewer has been working very diligently to find the answers to a list of MANY unsolved mysteries. You can find the 4 minute video by searching    college humor lost    The 5 star reviewer has come up with quite an interesting list of answers by finding an answer here, another one over there, and making some of them up on his own.    But my question is this......    How many people buy a NEW CAR in parts? Does the salesman direct us to one location for the fenders, another place for the bumpers, another .......... until the customer has a complete car that THEY have to put together themselves?    Nope, we all buy our NEW CARS in one, cohesive, and satisfying package.    People want that same satisfying package in their TV shows.    The writers of Lost told us that they would tie all of the mysteries from seasons 1 - 5 into a cohesive and satisfying story during season 6, and they did not do that.    The writers tried to pawn off various car parts to the viewers rather than provide us with a well made car.    SO MANY of the 5 star reviewers are trying to SELL \\"Lost\\" like it's the best thing since sliced bread. \\"Hey everybody..... Lost is great! You don't need to be spoonfed everything. Just BUY it. Just watch it. Don't think, just FEEL...... blah blah blah\\"    Well MANY viewers see Lost for the con job that it was and they are speaking out about it.    Read the 1 star reviews to see what avid Lost fans think about the series now.    Another person has commented in a few threads that he suspects that some of the 5 star reviews are actually being written by people who have some connection to the show.    After reading so many reviews telling the readers to \\"BUY, BUY, BUY\\", I am inclined to agree that there are people posting here who are hired salesmen/women.    Every person should read this short story, which is readily available to read online.....    \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" by Hans Christian Anderson. This story was published in 1837 in the book \\"Fairy Tales Told for Children\\"    Hans speaks the simple wisdom that every child can easily understand.    The moral of the story is..... With enough propaganda, the average person can be made to believe ANYTHING.    There are A LOT of 5 star reviewers who are trying to convince people that \\"Lost\\" is a great show. Well Lost started out to be a great show, but the con-men writers put an end to that.    After you read \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", ask yourself why the 5 star reviewers are pushing so hard to convince you that \\"Lost\\" is so great.    All of the 1 star reviewers agreed that \\"Lost\\" was great until season 6, so why this HUGE disagreement now?    Just ponder that story for a while. Simple truths are usually the best.    And a note to ALL of the people who are voting \\"yes or no\\" on the \\"helpful review\\"........     Vote NO if you are still afraid of the dark and sleep with a nightlight.    Vote YES if you can read this sentence.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Having seen the original years ago, I was hesitant to see the remake.  I didn't particularly enjoy the first one (Ralph Macchio always seemed whiny to me), and remakes rarely make a significant improvement.  This film is an exception.    If you have seen the original (hasn't everyone), you know the storyline.  While some details have changes, the overall plot is the same.  Here are some of the most noticeable improvements:    -Jaden Smith.  As the main character, he is amazing.  Granted, his parents are Hollywood royalty.  Regardless, his athleticism makes his character much more convincing than Macchio's and his presence on screen is remarkable for such a young actor.  Very well done.    -Jackie Chan.  I never had a problem with Pat Morita's portrayal in the original, but Jackie is wonderful.  He actually uses his acting skills convincingly, and his action shots are predictably great.  I wouldn't have thought of Jackie Chan for this role, he manages to nail it.    -Fighting scenes.  This is where the original really lost me.  The scenes in this film are a big upgrade.  Whereas in the original the fighting scenes looked like what you would expect to see at the local karate school, the sequences in this film are what you would expect from a major motion picture.    Don't go seeing it expecting some deep analysis of the human condition.  I saw it with my kids ages 7-11, and believe it was age-appropriate for them.  I just happened to enjoy it more than most of what I see with my kids.

B003C1QIO6|1.0|I saw Jack Johnson while helping out at a concert in which he was the featured performer.  I had no idea who he was.  The only Jack Johnson I knew before then was Jack Johnson the boxer, but of course that Jack, the legendary Jack, died long ago, and he wouldn't be caught dead singing like this Jack.  Simple rhymes, simple emotion, predictable as the surf but nowhere as profound.  This Jack, this mellow Jack, who should be called JJ because it's also simple, is the very re-birth of Wimpy Rock, all sensitive and empty like a Hallmark card.  If only he had become a boxer instead, like Original Jack was. Then he would be the first time traveler, because as a boxer, his talent would get him punched into next week.  But I'm just daydreaming.  In reality, I'm at this lousy concert to help with the lights, and I'm forced to listen to him and think bad thoughts.  He sounds like a poor imitation of imitation Paul Simon -- the singer, not the senator.  I wouldn't HAVE to listen to him if he became a boxer.  As a boxer, his so-called talent would make him the first time traveler because his lack of talent would get him punched into next week.  I imagine JJ in college, strumming the only three chords he knows on the guitar he got for Christmas.  He sings platitudes of lonely girls and love, just loud enough to annoy the others in the laundromat who'd prefer to listen to the machines.  Jack doesn't care.  He's playing for the 13-year-old girl near the window who already fantasizes what a god he is, and SO cute.  When JJ's underwear is dry, he packs up and heads out to get famous.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Gilmore Girls is easily one of the best series ever, right up there with MASH and West Wing in my opinion.  It has witty banter and a delightful use of the English language mixed with lots of lit and pop culture references.  Needless to say this was a smartly written series.  The acting on Lauren Graham and the entire cast is fabulous.<br /><br />That being said this final season is slightly odd compared to the rest.  The writing style and banter is still great, it just had an odd story line.  Luke and Lorelei have split, leaving Lorelei with Christopher for a good chunk of the season.  Rather creepy in my opinion.  Rory spends a few episodes pining for Logan, who is in London, then gets jealous over the Bobbi issue, and then doesn't mention Logan for an episode or two.  The is not much of the charming Luke/Lorelei interaction.  However Lane gets pregnant!  And a menagerie of other twists like pickle train spills, cars crashing into the dinner, Emily getting arrested etc.<br /><br />Over all, it is still really good.  Just wish we wouldn't have spent so much of the season with Luke and Lorelei avoiding each other.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I can't say it enough....if you don't have this album....at least 2 copies, you need to smack yourself....you're SOOOOOO missing out.    The BEST CD out in a long while.     One listen ...you'll see why. All these reviews aren't lying!
B001GCUO5M|2.0|...this  movie spoils itself from nearly the first of its CAD scenes (Scene 1). That's not the only slapped-together aspect this waste of time offers: how about dull improbable  dialogue, wooden acting, and a nonexistent pulse of suspense-building or terror. Totally flops, it  was putting me to sleep so I finally bailed. It gets two stars for a few  imaginative sets  and shots, that's about  it.<br />Another example of how it takes a good  director and story.  Hitchcock could do something shorter, in black and white or color, without  the graphic stuff,no computers,  and have you on the  edge of your  seat.
076532413X|2.0|The book was ok, not much like the TV adaptation, which we really liked.  We bought the book to see how the story ends.  The differences are so vast, reading the book offered no insight as to how the screenwriters would have ended their story.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|In a word, I love this musical - that's four words, I cheated. Can't wait to see the theater production but based on the soundtrack and a few youtube videos I expect to love it in theater even more.    Those who read reviews will notice that this musical got savaged by the critics - it's okay, that's their job. And one can understand why some folks are not pleased. Some of the old, beloved, revered characters from Phantom come to bad ends. Without putting too fine a point on it this story is a tragedy. Remember tragedies? Shakespeare wrote about 10 of them and they still get read & performed. But some modern critics seem to think they're illegal in this century.    If you like Lloyd Webber music I don't see how you couldn't like the music in Love Never Dies. The music is lovely and mezmerizing. The story is brilliant in my opinion. Tragic, but brilliant. For my part, I've little patience for those who complain that the story is implausable or that the characters behave out-of-character - nonsense.    Phans looking for a rerun of Phantom shouldn't bother with LND. If you expect that the characters have remained frozen in time you'll be disappointed. If you demand a story that's plausable LND is every bit as plausable as Phantom even though in real life & on stage love often dies. I think the musical is faithful to the personalities & motivations of the characters. If you're up for superlative Lloyd Webber music, masterful telling of a well though out, albeit tragic, story you may like Love Never Dies.

006145205X|1.0|This junk science keeps on returning from the depths of the Black Lagoon. This stuff is pure fiction. For example-this paperweight is bristling with errors and distortions. Like when he claims that \\"every country that tried protectionism\\" after the Wold War II suffered as a result. He cites South Korea and Taiwan as \\"countries that went the other way\\", and experienced miraculous growth. What really happened was that the governments of both nations subsidised key industries, actively promoted exports and used tariffs and laws to shut out competing imports. In both countries the state owned all the major commercial banks, allowing it to make decisions about investment. The United States would never have developed computers and internet technology without military Keynesianism (aka socialism by state assistance). When will these vapid egotistical gasbags finally go away?
B0013N3DSE|5.0|This is a classic film by every definition. Everything works well with this film, the fun storyline, the acting, the action, the adventure, the comedy, and the amazing color and cinematography! Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Basil Rathbone all do an excellent job as does the majority of the other cast members. I found the color restoration of the blu-ray disk to be extraordinarily amazing. Technicolor at its finest. Although partly directed by William Keighley, Michael Curtiz should get the majority of the credit for helming this remarkable film. I highly recommend this 1938 classic. I would also like to recommend viewers to a later comedy classic film starring Danny Kaye that has some similarities with Robin Hood entitled, [[ASIN:079215519X The Court Jester]].

B002ZG997M|4.0|As a fan of the post-apocalyptic film genre, I enjoyed The Book of Eli for its look, but felt that the story suffered as it went on. With bits of [[ASIN:0780624890 Blade]], [[ASIN:B0013FBS20 I Am Legend]], [[ASIN:B000NA1WGS The Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]], [[ASIN:B001FB563E The Road]], and a drop of [[ASIN:B001YV502C Children of Men]] mixed in, Book of Eli is a slickly-produced film, with the requisite bleached out colors and monochromatic/desaturated look of the genre. Like The Road, an unexplained nuclear holocaust has wiped out civilization, mentioned only in passing. Once again, our hero must get from point A to point B, traveling a road fraught with difficulties and dangers. And he must do it on foot.<br /><br />Denzel is Eli, a loner and tough-as-nails survivalist tasked with delivering the last remaining x to a safe location. In Children of Men, it was the world's last pregnant woman. In Book of Eli, it's the last remaining copy of the King James Bible. He has been walking for thirty years. The film opens with a very cool sequence of Eli in the forest stalking a feral cat with a bow and arrow, instantly establishing his resourcefulness, marksmanship, and super-badness for the audience. Visually, it just looks fabulous the way the scene is designed and filmed in monochromatic cyan with detritus raining down. Eli speaks softly and carries a big knife. In fact, it's a very, very big knife and he makes expert use of it against the roving gangs of thieves and cut-throats he encounters, hacking off hands and limbs with style. [[ASIN:B002HFWAYU Wesley Snipes]] would be proud.<br /><br />The real trouble for Eli (and this film's story) begins when he stops off for supplies at a ramshackle town run by a ruthless man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman), who had been sending out search parties to scour the wasteland for the book. While Eli is a man of faith and cherishes the book as the key to humanity's salvation, Carnegie covets it for a very different reason: to control the masses and expand his influence to other towns. He tries to make a deal and Eli refuses. At this point, Eli is no longer a loner dependent on his wits and reflexes for survival. He picks up extra baggage in the form of an attractive, but altogether annoying and poorly-developed side-kick character (Mila Kunis) who he now has to protect. This is where the script gets sloppy. Instead of being a story of the cool, quiet, and self-reliant stranger who only has himself to look after, it now becomes the story of \\"save the helpless girl from the bad-guys\\" and running away from the gangsters.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing details of Eli's survival techniques the most and how he copes with the dangers of the wasteland, but not enough of his back-story is given. That itself isn't the problem, because I'm plenty willing to enjoy a character's unexplained and mystery past and live in the here and now of his present situation, like Clint Eastwood's archetypal loner, the \\"Man with No Name\\" from the [[ASIN:0792842502 The Man with No Name Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly)]]. The real problem is the irritating tag-along Eli picks up, which for me, ruins the story. Gary Oldman, an actor I respect and admire, underwhelms here. He has played plenty of excellent villains before (Agent Stansfield in Leon, Zorg in Fifth Element), but his portrayal here is lackluster, devoid of quirks, and mostly uninteresting. Also worth mentioning is the wasted potential of Ray Stevenson as Carnegie's lead henchman. He has no memorable lines or scenes and dies in a cheap and inglorious manner.<br /><br />The final segment of the journey is very similar to Children of Men, though I did not mind because what happens after he gets to his destination was a pleasant twist. The very ending quite obviously hints at a sequel possibility with someone taking up Eli's mantle.<br /><br />Unlike some viewers, I did not take this film to be a celebration of religion or a condemnation of it. The Bible is arguable the most important book in western civilization and a natural choice for a film's central plot device. The Book of Eli is not perfect, but it's worth a look if you liked any of the films I mentioned above.t.

B00275EGWY|4.0|I loved it so much that I loaned it to my Dad, a vet.    The man didn't just become good at his job; he was his job. There are people who just live their occupation. This man devoted everything to what he did. He dedicated his very big heart to saving lives by killing bombs.    Kudos!
B001UV4XX8|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. I love Twilight Zone-type stories. I love sci-fi mysteries, and weird movies. But, do you know what I like more? Movies that have a point to it. The Box may have many well-done parts & elements to it, but stacked together, the movie comes crashing down in a disappointing heep of pointlessness & potential. Let's divide this movie into three parts, shall we? Warning: Here be spoilers!<br /><br />The first 45 minutes really plays kind of like the type of Twilight Zone where something weird happens that eventually leads to a moral dilemma. This moral dilemma comes packaged in a box, and happens to be a box with a button in it. Pushing the button promises to give the couple a million dollars, but it will also kill somebody the couple doesn't know. What would you do? You don't know if The Box is real. Heck, it could be one big joke! Granted, the guy who gave it to you gave off some bad vibes, but hey, how do you know he's telling the truth? It doesn't help that the couple has also recently learned of financial issues. A cheaper education for their son is denied, followed promptly by nose-bleeding by the denier. And the husband is denied entry into the NASA space program (I wouldn't be surprised if nose-bleeding occurs after this decision was made). So essentially, the first 45 minutes really is spent building characters, setting the mood and establishing a little of the reality. This of course all climaxes in Cameron Diaz pushing the button, leading her to basically be the 'Eve' in this 'Adam & Eve' story.<br /><br />Before we move on to part two, let's talk about the cast, shall we? James Marsden really hasn't been given a chance to show off his acting skill before now, but really, the guy can act, and he's naturally likable. Basically, I want to see more James Marsden in the future. Frank Langella is of course a fine actor, and he does the best with his character. As for Cameron Diaz, while her character is interesting enough, I was really put off by her southern accent. At least with Sandra Bullock in the Blindside I got over it after a while. Not true with Diaz here. It didn't help that she was trying REALLY hard in this movie too. But anyways, let's move on to part 2.<br /><br />The 2nd part of the movie turns into a homage to the paranoid conspiracy thrillers of the 1970s. This is probably the part that works most for me, as I ate most of it up. There were Zombie people, nose-bleeding, people in photographs, murder conspiracy. Richard Kelly just gets the mood so right in this aspect of the film, and it makes for a very good period piece. Of course, this is also the part of the movie  where a LOT of stuff is thrown at you. I personally was able to keep up, but despite all the mysteries being explored, I didn't really feel like we were solving anything. Or even that we were being given enough information to solve it. Thus, I felt like I was grasping at slippery straws, looking for something, anything to help me grab onto a semblance of what this movie was trying to say. This 2nd act culminates in a library. This sequence again proves that the mood & paranoia at this part of the movie is just right. There's a part where James Marsden is being followed by an increasing number of zombies in the library that is just excellently done. Of course, for James Marsden, he's led to three portals, two of which lead to hell. Well, that can't be good! I don't really know why, or what is happening right now, but it still can't be good! Cameron Diaz also meets up with Frank Langella again and Cameron gets to have an emotional moment, and gives a revelation that I thought would actually go somewhere. I don't think it ever does. Basically, Cameron Diaz is turned into a Zombie, James Marsden apparently walks into the \\"correct\\" portal. Let's recap quickly. We have all these building blocks that haven't really gone anywhere comprehensible yet, let's hope Richard Kelly can bring it all back around in the 3rd act.<br /><br />But just when you think it can't get anymore weirder... IT DOES!<br /><br />3rd Act: We learn that Frank Langella actually used to work for NASA, but then was struck by lightning when the Viking Probe got too close to a planet or something, so Frank Langella basically dies, then turns into a messenger type for what I believe is aliens. It's never actually stated who his \\"employers\\" are, but they do have access to the afterlife, and crap like that. Then, at a wedding, James Marsden is shown by a previous guy who had received the box a bunch of pictures, and diagrams, and told that he also received a box and killed his wife to save his daughter. But then, that guy is killed. All the while, we are seeing other characters, including the kidnapped son into these portal pools. Why? I HAVE NO CLUE! Then we find out that the boxes are actually a test sent by the aliens or somebody to test humanity to see if they deserve living. In this way, it's like another Twilight Zone episode, one where the aliens are testing humans to see if they're ready to join their ranks, to which of course, the humans usually fail the tests. Anyways... Basically, to pass the test, you're supposed to simply NOT PUSH THE BUTTON. Then we jump to Diaz's and Marsden's house, where Frank Langella gives them ANOTHER TEST. Since they pushed the button, they must pay by either their son going deaf and blind for the rest of his life, or James Marsden killing his wife. Since the couple decide that they're the ones that brought this on themselves, Marsden shoots Diaz, perfectly knowing what happened to the previous couple, to which Diaz dies, Marsden is arrested, and their son is basically going to die as an orphan since the last Dad didn't exactly last very long in the land of the living. The movie ends with Frank Langella giving another box to another family. By the way, the moment before Diaz dies, another couple pushes a button, leading us to believe that this is an eternal cycle that will eventually doom humanity to extinction.<br /><br />Sorry if this review has been plot-heavy, but I had to tell you how INSANE and FRUSTRATING this movie was. But, it didn't have to be like this. Let's say that the movie ended the same way it does, but it shows another couple deciding NOT to push the button, thus not dooming humanity to extinction. Or how about this? Go all \\"Knowing\\" on us and actually show the world getting destroyed because everybody had pushed the button. As is, the movie gives us closure on the two central characters, I guess, but little else, especially in terms of plot. What is the moral of the movie? Don't be selfish, even when aliens are making your financial lives harder. As is, humanity is doomed to extinction because they pushed a button. An exploration of free will? Maybe. The better decision here would be to press the EJECT button on your DVD player.k it can't get anymore weirder...

1423113381|4.0|As a mother who screens everything my 11-year-old daughter reads, I was very happy to recommend The Red Pyramid, Rick Riordan's latest offering, as the first of her summer reading material, and to supplement her current hunger for all things Egyptian (including the Theodosia series by R.L. LaFevers and The Pharaoh's Secret by Marissa Moss). As with the Percy Jackson series, the much faster pacing of The Red Pyramid is keeping her interest growing in the subject. In her own words, \\"The book, The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan is packed with adventure and mythology. When siblings Carter and Sadie find out they are A- godlings and B- they have to save the world and maybe sacrifice their Dad , they don't know what to expect. From talking baboons, crushes and flying ships, Carter and Sadie find out secrets from their past they never knew. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the Percy Jackson series and is interested in Egyptology. The only problem I had was that with alternative narrators, it was rather distracting. I still give it 4 stars!\\"

B002ZG997C|5.0|I first saw this movie at the theatre. It touched me on such an emotional level that I knew that I would need to purchase it as soon as it became available...which for me is highly unusual. I've long been a Denzel Washington fan, and now consider this to be his finest performance ever. Mila Kunis was excellent as well. I've read some of the other reviews for this film and it would seem that many of the reviewers are bending over backward to declare that the movie is not \\"religious\\". Well, in my opinion, it was very spiritual and was basically about the power of God in directing His servant to adhere to His Will through many extreme difficulties over a period of 30+ years in order to eventually accomplish the goal that God had intended. The movie begins in the final trial of Eli's journey and we are allowed to observe the constancy of Eli's \\"walk by faith, not by sight\\". It is a tale of beauty in a very bleak world.
030726999X|4.0|I find it puzzling that with all of the buzz about Larsson's \\"Millenium Trilogy\\" that some people would read this book without reading the first 2 novels in the series.  This book will not really be enjoyable to anyone who has not read the previous 2 books in the trilogy.  All of the character development and main plot points were introduced previously in those books.  To enjoy this book to the fullest extent, please read \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" first.<br /><br />That said, this book is a very satisfying conclusion to the Millenium Trilogy.  It is not as good of a mystery as \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" or as action-packed as \\"Played With Fire\\" (which is one of the most exciting books I've ever read), but it does wrap up the trilogy's major story lines in an entertaining way.  It's mostly a legal thriller with some espionage thrown in, so the pacing is brisker than the beginning of \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" which devoted a great deal of time to character development.  I am also pleased by Larsson's use of strong female characters throughout this novel as an underlying theme to tie the book together.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more action in this book, it's noticeably weaker than \\"Played With Fire\\" in that respect.  But it still is a very good novel that left me quite sad that Larsson had passed away, so we are unable to hear more from this gifted writer.  (With the possible exception of that fabled \\"4th manuscript\\" on his girlfriend's computer... )

B000002KBU|5.0|Joni's Christmas album...she's dreaming of a Blue Christmas (corniness aside)..it's \\"blue\\" as in blue, frozen waters to she can \\"skate away on\\". She survived the counteer-revolution on Woodstock...now it's, look, just let me sing and pay me.<br /><br />Of her first five albums, all masterpieces, this is perhaps her most personal, quietist; indeed, the musical accompaniment is mostly her own piano. Sidemen pop up on occasion: Stephen Stills, James Taylor, Sneaky Pete Kleinow (aka Sneeky Pete), Russ Kunkel (drums).<br />\\"Blue\\" is both a mood and an image - yes, this Canadian [no generalization intended] does paint an American landscape with inspired brush strokes.<br /><br />All the tracks are instantly engaging, lyrically and melodically; though the lyrics can be cliched at times: \\"a singer in the park...a dancer in the dark\\"; \\"makes me weak in the knees\\", but even then they make sense musically, sound beautiful, and work in a conversational sense. One bad phrase \\"kiss a Sunset pig\\" - ouch.<br /><br />The album starts off with that song you wish was titled \\"I Am On A Lonely Road\\" and it gets better and better - I mean, greater and greater. The title tune reminds this Reviewer of any number of songs from the \\"Song To A Seagull\\" album - just a stunningly sensuous sound, with a melody Chopin would be distracted by. \\"A Little Green\\" is another which should be hung in the Museum Of Art in New York City - as in, hung somewhere in the ambience...and near a blow-up of the cover photo. Blue.
B001EN71CW|2.0|I didn't care for this series for a number of reasons which I'll try to articulate. In my opinion (and by the way everything I'm about to say is just my opinion, so I won't bother saying that in front of every sentence), this is one of the more lazy attempts at mashing two genres together. While the space western idea has potential (Star Wars can fit into this in many ways), Firefly literally takes standard western cliches and space cliches and clumsily glues them together without even trying to smooth the seams. Horses, spaceships, saloons and lasers all co-exist awkwardly in the same universe. The characters are one- or two-dimensional standard types: the lovable rogue, the quirky girl with a heart of gold, the conflicted but helpful preacher, etc. The lead character is ironically is lacking character; he's a good looking actor that could be replaced by any good looking actor. He brings nothing interesting to the role he plays. Some actors are fine (nothing remarkable) and are doing their best with the thin dialog and script. Imaging writing down as many space cliches and western cliches you can come up with, cutting them up, putting them in a hat, then pulling out a handful and pinning them to a board. Now fill in the rest to get from one cliche to the next. That's how it seems the writers came up with each episode. Lazy writing, uninspired casting, and a clunky concept make for a comparatively poor series.

0684803356|5.0|I've probably read this book over 4 or 5 times throughout the years, first having read it as part of an assignment in a High School English class.  This is my absolute favorite book, and I'll tell you why.  As many reviewers have already pointed out, this book is enjoyable on so many levels: the characters are deep and complex; the questions about their purpose are deep.<br /><br />As a native Spanish speaker, I truly enjoy this book much more because Hemingway's prose is an exact translation of how the characters would speak in their Spanish setting, which I only realize now living in Puerto Rico and re-reading this masterpiece after many years (and two war tours).  The conversations, which may seem awkward to a non-Spanish speaker, are perfectly natural if translated into Spanish, adding to the realism of his tale.  Chalk this up to Hemingway's genius and his ability to create realistic worlds in which his characters live and die.
B001NXDSLG|5.0|I would highly recommend this for anyone who is 50+ years old and remembers what it was like back then.And for the under 50 folks you will appreciate the love and happiness of the baby boomer generation and how much music has changed.Especially all the technology available today was unheard of back then as you will see from the DVD.I suggest you buy this for a \\"collectors item\\" as I am sure it will be a valuable investment for the younger peoples portfolio.Also a lot of the artists were the best of the best and some have passed away and some are still performing.
B001NXDSLG|5.0|As one of the 38 million people who claim they were at Woodstock, it was a wonderful nostalgic trip. All of the baby boomers who could have been there will appreciate the glimpse into one part of the world they may not have even been aware of. The younger folk will get a glimpse of history. A great (nearly) four hours to spend with your 20-30 year old kids. Totally groovy and love filled!

B000059XUO|4.0|Based on the brutal graphic novels of James O' Barr, The Crow follows a murdered rock star named Eric Draven(Brandon Lee) who was murdered along with his fiancé, who was also brutally raped, by a pack of savage hoodlums on the night before Halloween. A year later, a crow brings Eric back to life as a kind of zombie in order for him to avenge the death of his loved one so that they can finally rest in peace. After putting on mime make-up and dressing himself in dark clothing, he goes out and exacts gruesome revenge He eventually comes across the drug lord and gang leader known as Top-Dollar, a decadent and incestuous monster of a man who will make his task of avenging the death of a loved one a lot trickier.      One thing that I can easily say about this film is that it is one of the best looking superhero films out there, if not THE best. Forget about films like Sin City, which goes all the way into basically replicating the exact look of the comic book that it is based on. There's nothing wrong with that film, but I feel that using practical effects, lighting, and skillful photography works a lot better. I feel that it looks better, it helps bring you into the world that the film takes place in a lot more smoothly, and it incites more of a sense of atmosphere. Sin City is fine, but this is more my kind of thing. The Crow makes it a point to allow the tone of this story to shine through over everything else. It is a film that is, more than anything, about loss and about death. What I find unique about it is that it takes it's time to not get into the heavy-handed nature of it all and instead allows it to be a part of the story. I found this approach to be incredibly powerful, and also somewhat unusual. Instead of showing us these characters as how they are, we are instead treated to a kind of dignified anthem of madness and chaos. The villains in this film are just as crazy and just as deranged as those in any other action comic book superhero film, but instead ofgiving them a bunch of cool lines and ridiculous costumes, the film gives them personality. Sure, they are recycled personalities, but what I appreciated the most about them was that the death scenes were about as cold and as brutal as they could be without being preachy. There is a lot of death and a lot of blood, but it all works surprisingly well in establishing the bleak, dark, and sinister atmosphere. Alex Proyas is a skilled filmmaker who has always been talented when it comes to establishing worlds, and this is a tremendous example of his visual imagination. Yes, the source material comes from the mind of James 'O Barr, but Proyas does a great job of translating those same feelings into this, both visually and also through the tone of the scenes. I like the way he uses more of a distanced sense of interest in his events and a closer and more intimate sense of interest in his characters, including his villains. Everyone in the film has their own neat little quirks, and it's so refreshing to see that in an action film, especially one like this that uses supernatural elements.      I'll probably always love this film. It was the first R-rated film I ever watched. My mom rented it when I was about five. I remember not trying to pay too much attention to it because it kept on scaring the hell out of me, particularly because of a scene involving a character's eyeballs being pecked out by the crow. That scene makes me laugh now, but at the time I was frozen in fear at that scene. I think my mom probably forgot about that scene and left the room before that part happened. One thing that is worth noting is that this is an extremely violent film, probably the worst film I've seen or at least one of the most worst. One of the most bizarre things about this film, actually, is that it's filled with graphic, gruesome death and gore, and yet it has a sense of morality to it as well as morality based lessons about love, companionship, and doing the right thing in times of darkness. It's one of the strangest juxtapositions I've seen in film, and I'm sure that a lot of viewers probably were, or are, turned off from it for these reasons. I never let things like that bother me, however, especially if the film is a superhero film. Despite what many people say, this is an entertaining film that is full of over-the-top action, brutal fight scenes, gut-wrenching sadism, and explosive death. If you like brutal violence, this is one to check out.     Brandon Lee, while he is certainly not a good actor, has plenty of charisma, and the sadistic glee he takes in dispatching his victims is quite amusing and is well-timed. He plays a character who, while not entirely interesting, is certainly very likable. Lee's screen presence in this film is exceptional. The rest of the cast is colorful and appropriately cartoon-like. The little girl, Sarah, is angry and deeply reminiscent of teenagers I knew from the nineties. I'm not sure if this is a good thing, but either way the performance of Rochelle Davis is the second strongest of the entire cast, the first being from Ernie Hudson. Ernie Hudson is an actor that has continued to impress me over and over and over again, and his performance in this is no exception. Out of all the actors in this film, his portrayal as a depressed police officer is what really elevates the material to the highest degree. He's the most sympathetic and the most honest character out of the entire cast, and Hudson's performance is just great. He's also not afraid to have a sense of humor, despite the strange situations he finds himself in.     The one thing that really helps make this film work, however, is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled to the brim with dirty, grimy, dark, and hard metal and industrial music from the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Cure. It is absolutely one of the best, I repeat, THE BEST nineties film soundtracks you will ever hear. Not only does it flow well with the film, butit also is the best example of the time period the film was released in. As many people know, 1994 was an insane year in music. Bands like Green Day, Soundgarden, and Nine Inch Nails were getting a lot of airplay, but at the height of their popularity came the death of Kurt Cobain. Nirvana was as popular again as it had ever been, but along with their popularity came a slew of other bands that fans of that kind of music had been clamoring for. Grunge music had never been so popular, and it was that kind of music that people were raving about. The soundtrack to this film features some of the best of that kind of music and some of the best of this time in the nineties. It works because this film takes place in a kind of universe that is full of disappointment and death, and that's what a lot of this music is about. It's rare to find such a perfect combination of music and mood in film, but this is one of the best examples of a nineties film that does exactly that.    Make no mistake, The Crow is still an action film. However, it is an action film that takes advantage of all opportunities to elevate itself above the material and works in doing so a good amount of the time. It's one of the best films of it's genre and one of the best action films of the nineties. It's not for the squeamish, nor is it for the easily offended, but it's got a lot of beautiful cinematography, a lot of good emotion, some stunning performances from the supporting cast, a lot of high quality action, and a brilliant soundtrack. When the film doesn't work, it's not overly distracting or ridiculous. In a lot of ways, it's one of the most charming films I've seen of it's type. I think that it's a very good film and that it's worth seeing. If anything, it's one hell of a satisfying and savage action film.

B000O76TA4|4.0|Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club explores the darker side of mental instability in the form of a dark comedy. The film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man, played by Edward Norton. His life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and, after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life, they became inspired to co-create a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their heart's content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal male-bonding. Things get complex when a female drifter named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share. Things only get worse when Tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected people.      As technically talented as Fincher is, what I admire most about the film is how he doesn't let the visuals tell the story. I know that a lot of moviegoers hate narration, but trust me when I say that it is put to good use here. The sarcastic, bitter, angry voice of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film. Is the film a satire? I'd go onto say that it is as much a satire as South Park is. So then why the slick visuals? Why the sly, cool tone? Why the clever dialogue? Well, to me it all seemed very forced and over-the-top. Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film knows this. You can tell in the sarcastic narration. I think that people may likely forget that it is Edward Norton's character who is doing the narration and so therefor we're watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviouslycrazy. Every person in this film is crazy in one way or another. Much like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Fight Club shows a world devoid of any sort of normal thoughts of any kind, whether independent or not. What makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them. However, this is also how the film's humor comes through. The physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around his grow more self-aware, more open-minded, and more like he was at one time. What makes this so funny is the fact that acts and methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous that only a fool could ever take it seriously. Not to ruin the plot, but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed, there comes a point where politics don't seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world today.      Looking at this film ten years later, it still has just as much power as it did in 1999 or 2000 or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it. As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent. His films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy, and Fight Club is no different. The performances are excellent. Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter. As for Brad Pitt, he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film. I definitely wouldn't call this his best performance. He is required to act in a sub-conscious way that feels full of self-deprecation, and this shouldn't be all that hard for any good actor as long as they are a good sport and they aren't afraid of looking stupid. I prefer his roles in films like 12 Monkeys in which he plays much more deeply troubling and complicated characters. The music in this film works equally as well. It's very dirty, industrial, and overbearing, much like the film itself. However, it is, at times, heavy to the point of absurdity, so it also helps with the humor of the film too. The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it. It's full of blood and guts from beginning to end, though it doesn't exactly have a high bodycount. It's often very ugly to look at, which I don't mind except when it gets to the point where it makes the film feel a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower. This is also a very very homoerotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other. Their mannerisms, as well as their quick little quirks and playful flirtations, get pretty weird after a while. It's about as homoerotic a film as Interview With the Vampire. I can't say that I'm anywhere near as infatuated with it as I was when I was in high school, where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant, and just as well, this film makes it very difficult to take Brad Pitt seriously in most of his other films. None of these things where what I originally loved about this film, however, and the film itself still works great as a comedy. The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done. The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.      So overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film. It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore. Would I recommend it to everyone? Definitely not. I will say that it's most worthwhile audience would be people who are interested in films about insanity.It's one of the best ones you'll find, or at least one of the best ones that was released in the past couple of decades. The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho. These people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity, but they definitely don't. Sure, there's a lot going on in both of these films, and the characters may have a fascinating level of detail to them, but that does not mean that these films don't offer more than good entertainment and some ideas to think about. I don't think the characters in Fight Club should be taken seriously and I'm astounded that anyone even could take them seriously. It's like saying that Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong. Both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things, but that doesn't change the finale of the film. If you're going to watch Fight Club, please don't try to watch it with an open-mind about the characters and the things that they say. Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity. I'm sure that the film will have the desired effect on you.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|Pros: After owning a couple of not-so-great Bluetooth headsets, I really like my Plantronics Voyager Pro and so do the people I talk to while using it.  Leaving it in the car unprotected or stuffing it in my pocket with coins and car keys was giving me some concern, so I purchased this case to keep it from getting dinged up.  Sometimes, depending on where I am (restaurants, for instance), I'm a little self-conscious about wearing a headset, so I usually like to take it off.  The Voyager Pro is so comfortable to wear, however, that I often forget I have it on!  The case is designed to fit this particular headset model, the smooth leather exterior and brushed interior make it both functional and smart looking, while the simple magnetic cover makes it easy to open, replace or remove your Voyager Pro.<br /><br />Cons: While it's definitely sturdy enough for a device as lightweight as a Bluetooth headset, I probably would have bought a hard case if I had found one.  The belt clip is adequate, although an optional clip for the car visor would have been a nice addition.  I also thought it was a little bit expensive with shipping. Those are the 3 reasons why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I would still recommend it though.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|M. Atwood should be banned from commenting on Amazon or anywhere. It's not a \\"Passion of Christ\\" type of movie far from that it's a action movie(pretty good actions) with real good post-apocalyptic scenarios accompanied by outstanding acting.It's original and kept me imagining how would we live in those conditions. I would give a \\"0\\" star to him if I could for commenting a movie without watching it.
0143034901|4.0|This is an enjoyable book that grabs your attention and keeps it throughout.  It is reasonably well-written, though a bit formulaic and predictable.  I read it in Spanish, so I can't comment on the English translation.  I would recommend this book for a quick read, especially for trips or vacations where you want to be mindless for a while.  Very entertaining.

032147404X|4.0|This is a great book on photography. It reveals all the secrets as to why professional photographers' pictures turn out the way they do. I have found this book to be very helpful, no matter what camera you're using. In spite of this, though, this book would be more useful if I had an SLR (which I don't have, but intend on getting in the distant future...).
B0019N8P2W|5.0|When I first got it I was kind of worried that I wouldn't like it the same way I had enjoyed the show in my youth. I mean, it's a show about high school. I was in high school when I used to see it back in the day and so I wondered if my tastes and humor had changed enough to render the show unlikeable. But as soon as I started watching the first episode I realized that I had worried over nothing.     It's still a great show with a great sense of humor and the same crazy wacky goodness that kept bringing me back the first time.    Only now I get to watch it over and over again whenever I feel like it.  Also, now I can actually remember it and better appreciate the jokes and subtle (and not so subtle) interactions between the different characters.    In addition, unlike most animated shows at the time, Daria actually had a forward moving plot and real character development. (Most noticeable in the last two seasons.) And the show was allowed to have a real ending on the creator's terms. That was made it clear that the series was over and it had tied up the loose ends over the last movie and brought real closure to the audience which was unheard of in animation at the time.    I'm kind of saddened that they didn't try to show Daria and Lane in their college years, (Oh, what could have been.) but I'm happy with what we got which is a really great show with a crazy wonderful cast of characters.    All in all a Great Show.    I recommend this show to all my friends.    5 Stars    \\"Telephone!\\"  \\"Doorbell!\\"  \\"Sarcasm!\\"
B000021XR5|5.0|So many songs on this album hold a place in my heart and remind me of so many good times. I'll admit when I remember first hearing this I was slightly disapointed . Took repeated listens and it grew on me fast though and has no skippable songs. Some of STP's best songs ever are on here. This solidified them as a great rock band and not another grunge clone like so many had them pegged as in early 90's. Nearly another perfect album by stp, highly recommended.
B00275EHJG|5.0|In Toy Story 3, Andy has to decide what to do with his toys as he prepares to leave for college. Woody, Buzz, and friends end up at Sunnyside, a dark and notorious daycare center ruled by the evil stuffed bear Lots-O. Their attempt to escape and get back home results in the most dangerous and thrilling adventure of their lives.<br /><br />Though just as hilarious as the first two, Toy Story 3 is more serious. In fact, I concur with Michael Medved's opinion that it could be rated PG rather than G. There are some very scary parts, one of which caused several children in the theatre to cry out loud. There are also some very touching, even sad, parts, as the film deals with the theme of growing up and moving on.<br /><br />I mentioned the humor. Though most of it is great, there is some potty humor. And some of the scenes with Barbie and Ken (who plays a major part in this movie) were over the top (for a preschooler, anyway).<br /><br />Overall, Toy Story 3 is a terrific movie. The animation is amazing, and some of the scenes are breath-taking (or heart stopping). You won't find a more enjoyable movie for the little ones or the grown-ups.
B000002IZ4|5.0|One of the best albums of the 90's and of all time for that matter. Each song flows into the next and there is no song thats less than 5 stars. Maybe it was because of the time and place and the memories this album holds for me Idk, but compared to all other stp albums this ranks the highest. This album never grows old and truly is a masterpiece of straight up rock and roll!
0393061310|4.0|After finishing this book you really do get a sense the author really knows what he is talking about. His premise is that humans are mostly a function of their environment and the environment makes them evolve. So many interesting facts about the evolution of farming and domestic animals.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|Knowing that there would be some graphic scenes I decided to watch this movie anyway.  I found the movie interesting, but the scenes of torture and mutilation was a bit much for my sensibilities.  Definitly not for kids under 17 IMO.  But I felt like a deer in the headlights, not really wanting to see such things but not being able to move my eyes from it.  That said, I had difficulty getting the graphic scenes out of my mind at bed time so I tried to compensate by watching a lighter movie afterward.      I do agree with the viewers who felt it should have had a different ending.  I think it would have been a better ending had he gotten away sort of like Hannibal Lecter in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".  THAT would have left me with an OMG feeling.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|Pandorum is a great scifi movie. Do not believe those bogus reviews that say otherwise. Pandorum will satisfy the scifi movie geeks. The story, actors, and special effect are great. Once you start watching, it will keep you in suspense wondering what is going to happen next until you reach the ending which will surprise you and would leave you wanting more and waiting for a sequel.<br /><br />I will conclude saying this. Pandorum is a highly underestimated movie that deserves your attention if you are in to scifi movies. The story was well written and the actors are great. This movies deserves and needs a sequel.
B003IWRE3I|1.0|Boring, a real stinker; and so much so that I won't spend any more time to say more.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|Like many others here, I consider myself a solid Tom Petty fan and my collection of his stuff is pretty complete, at least so far as his commercial offerings goes.     I got the new album on Friday and saved the first listen for a 45 minute car trip I needed to make, as I think Tom Petty and a road trip, even a brief one, is always a great combination. I started listening and became perplexed as the CD continued to play. There had been a lot of build up around this album as being a departure from previous work and a foray into solid blues with comparisons to \\"Exile on Main Street\\" being tossed around. Sounded like a great idea with their southern roots and the always top notch Heartbreakers musicianship.     But I wasn't getting that. It's a solid Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album with great guitar playing, production that sounds very clean and professional, solid songsmanship by Tom and the general tightness of the band that generates the respect that they have earned and deserve.     Still, I thought it was going to be something else. I wasn't sure what until \\"U.S. 41\\" came on and something clicked. That's a trip to the dark side that I like, and more what I was hoping for, and there's a couple of others like \\"Takin' My Time\\" and \\"Running Man's Bible\\" that stand out for me, but for the most part it sounds like a continuation, rather than a significantly different approach, of what has been done before.      So if this isn't it, what was I hoping for? The recent album that comes to mind is the Allison Krauss and Robert Plant album, \\"Raising Sand\\". There were two artists who had laid down very well known and respected musical legacies but when they got together with T. Bone Burnett, they came up with something creative, earthy, bluesy and to my ears, very unexpected and welcome, even fresh sounding though the material was quite vintage.     I don't want T.P. and the Heartbreakers to sound like Krauss and Plant, and \\"Raising Sand\\" hadn't come to mind as a comparison in any way until I was listening to Mojo, but I think it's what I was thinking that they might have done. They are certainly capable of it musically but they may not be up for it. Tom Petty is the boss and the leader and the creative center of the band. T. Bone Burnett was the creative anchor for \\"Raising Sand\\". The choice of material and the overall sound was very much influenced by the leaders in each case with plenty of input from a team of pros.     Mojo is a fine Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, and I won't hesitate to put it on. But, to me, it's not a compelling reevaluation of what they are about or a real test of what they are capable of. Of course they play great on Mojo, but they always play great. If I hear that Tom and T. Bone are wood shedding with an eye to a future collaboration, that would get my curiosity up. If they do, they should make a documentary DVD of the process from start to finish.

B000068FY0|5.0|Every few months, I re-remember this album for one reason or another, and I pull it back out and listen to it, and I'm amazed again. Every time.<br /><br />First of all, the audio fidelity is unmatched in all of recorded music, even to this day. It just sounds incredible. The spaces between the notes are silent. Everything is clear and full. When a guitar or sax should be \\"sharp,\\" it cuts your ears. When it should be punchy and tight, it tickles your nose. When it should be smooth and creamy, it strokes your skin. Why can't someone make an album today that sounds this good? I don't understand what they had going on in the studio here, but it was beyond anything that I've ever heard. I mean, this album makes Dark Side of the Moon sound flat and boring by comparison! It's the ultimate \\"listening\\" experience.<br /><br />Ok, that's out of the way. Now on to the music itself. I am a real fan of the musicianship on display here. You've got every instrument under the sun being blended in such a satisfying way. Organs, winds, guitars, percussion, keys and voices combine in the most dynamic and lively set of songs around.<br /><br />\\"School\\" really lets you know right from the beginning what you're dealing with. I love the contrast in this era of Supertramp with the point-counterpoint voices of the two lead singers. There is so much emotion conveyed with their two voices that one voice alone could never properly impart.<br /><br />Everyone knows \\"Dreamer\\" and \\"Bloody Well Right,\\" but Songs like \\"Rudy\\" and \\"Hide in Your Shell\\" just kill me. The stories told by these songs are emotional and connect with me deeply, despite being from an era before I was even born. I don't think any other medium could convey the message of \\"Hide in Your Shell\\" better than it was done on this album. It's cathartic. It's almost transcendental.<br /><br />A saxophone solo should, by all rights, sound a bit cheesy. How they managed to have these rough, scorching sax solos on this album, I'll never know.<br /><br />Whoever plays the keys on \\"Bloody Well Right\\" is a seriously impressive musician. I mean Ashkenazy-level impressive. To hide that talent in a 70s prog rock band is almost criminal.<br /><br />I love the dynamics. I love the lyrics. I love the melodies and counter-melodies and harmonies and the texture of the rhythm section. I love the physical presence of this album when you're listening to it.<br /><br />I've listened to other Supertramp albums over the years, and other than Breakfast in America, I just couldn't find a lot to like. I understand that the band changed a lot over the years, so it makes sense that they would have peaks and valleys where quality is concerned, but man...what a great album this is. Even Breakfast in America, which was apparently a more popular album at the time, is a weak offering on a track-by-track basis compared to Crime of the Century. It is less in every way.<br /><br />Please buy this, and enjoy it.now.<br /><br />Whoever plays the keys on \\"Bloody Well Right\\" is a seriously impressive musician.

B00362DRQS|4.0|Originally released in 1983, 1 year after the ultra-popular \\"RIO\\", this album was a must have for every teenager at my high school and probably most others world-wide. Hit songs like \\"Union of The Snake\\", \\"New Moon On Monday\\" and who could forget \\"The Reflex\\", were played on MTV, radio, and every walkman, boombox and car stereo for at least a good 2 years by these British heartthrobs who seemed unstoppable at the time. Sadly, this would prove to be the last studio album, little did the fans know, by the original Fab 5 hitmakers, but what a way to go out. The non-single, album tracks flow finely along with the hits, but I imagine the casual listener would probably skip right through the songs. All in all I'll admit the songs are over produced with a few too many layered keyboard parts, but it's a great sounding album with some well written pop songs and the usual moody Duran style ballads. Now, the real gems here for the true Duran fans are the bonus disc of remastered remixes and the long awaited \\"As The Lights Go Down\\", a 1984 concert film recorded in Oakland, California that has been a much sought after item that for the first time ever is finally on DVD. All the videos are also included as well as some great TV sing along spots too. But the goldmine here is the concert. Every hit song performed with much energy is here for your audio and visual enjoyment. Sit in front of your HDTV, crank up that Home Stereo System and enjoy Duran Duran at their musical peak. A little expensive anywhere else but as usual, Amazon offers the lowest price that I've seen anywhere.
0385528752|5.0|I recently read Switch and Made to Stick, back-to-back. The authors have taken years of research and put them into simple, easy-to-read books. One of the most compelling benefits, however, is that I can honestly say that I have never retained as much info from two books as I have from these. It is a credit to the authors for using their own teachings in writing to fantastics books.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am not as much of an audiophile as most of the other reviewers, so I won't comment on sound quality compared to other professional headphones.  However, I can attest to the durability of the MDR-7506's.  Although the covering for the earpads have flaked off, my headphones are still going strong after more than 11 years of regular use.  I am only now starting to have some problems with sound only coming through one side, probably because I accidentally bent the jack a few years ago.  If I had a soldering iron I would replace the jack myself, but I think it's about time for a new pair anyway.<br /><br />Edit: 13 years and counting... The headphones are still working great!
B000AQJPQE|3.0|I was disappointed to open the box and see that it is a batterie operated night light.  I thought that it was going to be real light that I could wire up to the ceiling fixture.  I kept it because it goes well with the theme of the room but now I have to get a real light for the room.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I saw the Oprah version on Discovery and thought that it was a terrible follow-up to Planet Earth. Then, when I realized there was a David Attenborough version, I bought it and it is incredible. America needs to stop dumbing things down for its citizens.

B002HNA95E|5.0|I thought this was a really great compilation set and included just about all of the Madonna songs that I love to workout and dance to - a fun way to lose weight according to [...].

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I'm watching it now...Oprah narrating the deep sea episode.  I didn't know she narrated a version of this amazing series and wondered what why David Attenborough wasn't speaking, whom I thoroughly enjoyed on the Planet Earth series.  Even Sigourney Weaver did a fine job narrating that series.  I understand Oprah does the U.S. version of Life.  Too bad.  I hate Oprah.  I hate her talk show, I hate her voice, I hate her false politics and her arrogance.  She's a phony.  And that falseness actually comes through in her narration.  She's reading without nuance, without interest, without knowledge, sleepy.  She's a bore.  I'm turning this off and getting the Attenborough version.  Please do the same.  While you're at it, stop reading the Oprah's Book list.
0765322889|5.0|I read the reviews before reading and was concerned about a lot of people complaining about the sheer number of characters on another review site and how it was extremely confusing. Now that Im done I have to say that this book was actually very good. I have a lot of trouble keeping track of characters in books especially if they are very weird names. But maybe because I was forewarned about the large number of characters, I read the book more slowly than usual and didnt have any trouble whatsoever keeping track of the characters, places etc.<br /><br />If I recall, George RR Martin's books also have a ton of characters, places etc and I remember feeling a bit more confused reading the first book of that series.<br /><br />As I was reading the book I kept thinking of the black company books which I loved and then I read some reviews here on amazon which mentioned the black company and I completely agree this book has a similar feel.<br /><br />Many have said this first book was the worst - I thought it was pretty good so Im excited about the next ones. I definitely think this book is a buy.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This album is a sure sign of the apocalypse because \\"Sean Puffy Combs\\" is one of the producers. Yea even that hack can recognize musical talent when it's staring him in the face.    Listen to the album and the first thing you think is what did I just listen to? You'll listen a second time and think I like it but something's not right so you'll listen again and you'll start to notice that this young lady has weaved a tapestry of sound into this album that few artist do these days. You'll hear strings, horns, wind chimes, guitars, beat machines, turntables scratching there's not much she doesn't use. She could have called this album \\"the kitchens sink\\" because of everything she put into it and surprisingly enough 90% of it works. Don't get me wrong she goes a little too far out into left field on a couple of songs, BaBopBye Ya comes to mind but Ms Jonella takes a lot of chances on this album and it's amazing that the album is as cohesive as it is.  Other reviewers keep calling this Pop, this is not pop, it's not R&B it's simply music. When truly great artist produce great work everyone should be able to appreciate it as music. I'm not a country music fan, in fact I hate it but man could \\"Johnny Cash\\" create good music. I'm not a huge fan of Rock but Metallica's master of puppets album was incredible as was Prince's \\"sign of the times\\"     Don't get me wrong this album is not on the level of the artist previously mentioned but I can say I don't remember them creating a first album this good. Let's hope this is the sign of things to come.
B000001ESF|5.0|This is quite possibly Rush's best album. All of the songs are great and more musical than I expected them to be. \\"2112\\" is an amazing song, telling the story of a man who finds a guitar in the bleek and empirical future. It combines music and story telling into one. Neil Peart did an amazing job writing the material for this album, with the exception of 2 songs. Geddy Lee's bass work is good as ever, and ALex Lifeson does amazing things with a guitar here. If you want an album that will show you just how great Rush is, this is the one to have.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|This may have some of the best guitar in years but there is really only one song  composition worth mentioning. The last track \\"Good Enough\\" is an amazing SONG. (although it borrows from \\"I put a Spell on You\\" , then again hundreds of songs do!)  The rest of this LP does not have outstanding songwriting (there are no commercial hits) and there is even less melody. It is simply an exercise in jamming to riffs. I didnt find the rest of the album all that musically or lyrically interesting. Compare the songs here to some of Tom's great compositions such as \\"It's Good To Be King\\" or  almost anything off Full Moon Fever or Wildflowers. There is nothing mind blowing or ethereal unfortuantely. After Tom pushed toward that sort of concept \\"The Last DJ\\" he seems more interested now in just having fun and playing without spending as much time in isolation composing. For me, that is just too uninteresting. I have HEARD great jams before.  I listen to songs. and originality in words and melody. THIS is NOT that LP. It is what it is. Solid musicianship with no pretense. It is not going to be a favorite. It's just \\"Good Enough\\", for me.
B000063DGC|5.0|I think this one of the best live albums I have ever heard. All of the songs are done well and capture the magnificance of Randy Rhoads' amazing guitar skills. I don't usually like live albums, but this the one that I can listen to and enjoy the whole time. Randy's guitar solo near the end of \\"Suicide Soulution\\" shows just how great he was. Tommy Aldridge's drum solo at the end of \\"Steal Away the Night\\" showed his skills as well, but he uses the same drum solo done in evry show he does. But, overall, this would be a great live album to own and enjoy.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I purchased this adapter to plug in one or more firewire hard drives to my MacBook Pro. It works fine, doesn't fall out, and (while there was no reason I would expect it to not) handled my daisy-chaining more than one drive behind it. I don't expect to use FireWire while traveling, but in case I do, it's even small enough to fit in my laptop bag.
0156027321|2.0|Like many, I found the beginning of the book to be engaging. A very good look at various religions, differences therein and how to tackle rejection of the various ideas. It is also a fascinating bit of delivery for animal behavior and information.  This is where it falls apart.    You are vaguely aware that there is metaphor throughout but the story bogs down in massive detail for a story that matters very little in the end.  Unfortunately you need to decide in the end if the desire was a religious introspection or animals as a metaphor for life.    Sadly the narrative at the end drops into simplistic sentence structure that kills any interest you may have had left.    When it is all done they wrap it up and let you know that events occurred and there are no concrete answers.  Maybe that is what you are supposed to take from the whole experience.  Mostly, I just pray to God I never have to read this again.

B003HE2B6C|5.0|Shout It Out is not only the best Hanson album to date, but also my favorite cd of all time.  It has everything you're looking for. For example, the first single from the album, \\"Thinkin Bout Somethin\\" is fun and easy to dance to, while the slower, \\"Me Myself and I\\" is moving and beautiful. The horns that embellish a number of the songs are fantastic. Give this album a chance and you won't be disappointed!

B003HLM2QO|2.0|If you were trying to decide whether or not to buy Ozzy's new disk Scream, and someone described the disk by saying, \\"It sounds just like a friggin Ozzy record! It rocks!\\" Would that be enough for you to make the purchase? Well it should be if the record that someone said that it sounded like was [[ASIN:B000063DFT Blizzard of Ozz]].<br /><br />But alas, unfortunately, Scream doesn't come close to measuring up to Blizzard or any of Ozzy's first three solo albums. In fact, you'd indeed have to go all the way back to 1980 (Blizzard) to find an Ozzy studio solo album that had more than 3 songs on it that you just played over and over again. Now I realize of course that my statement is all a matter of opinion, but I'm willing to bet that only devout Ozzy fans would disagree. There are no surprises on Scream; it sounds just like I thought that it would and just like you think it will too...just like...just like well, let's put it this way...Not since Ozzmosis back in 1995 has Ozzy turned in a studio work that has measured average or above.<br /><br />Scream has only one song that I think might last in my media player's rotation for any extended period of time and that song is Diggin' Me Down. I Want It More is another heavy rocker, so perhaps just both of those songs would be worthy of download. What I suggest is previewing the album over at Ozzy's MySpace page (if he's still streaming it) before buying the entire CD.<br /><br />On Scream the awesome Zakk Wylde is out on guitar, and that my friends is a major blow to the Ozzy franchise. It may end up being the difference between a disk that had a chance of going Over the Mountain and one that could end up being buried under it??? Although Zakk's greatness sure didn't save [[ASIN:B00005QG9G Down to Earth]] or [[ASIN:B000URDEA6 Black Rain]], so maybe it was just time for a line-up change...again. Kudos to new guitarist Gus G for laying down some decent riffs; you had some very big shoes to fill, my brother. An interesting addition to the band for Scream is Rick Wakeman's son Adam on keyboards, but a good keyboardist does not make a great Heavy Metal band.<br /><br />Sorry, fans, just like Ozzy's last two studio albums, Scream just doesn't do it for me. Look, this review in no way reflects my total respect for Ozzy coming out at 60-something years old to give us some more music, nor does it acknowledge the history that the man has given to Metal. And I apologize for that. (See my 5/8/2007 review of Ozzy's 2002 DVD [[ASIN:B000068TOX Live at Budokan]] for a better perspective of the kind of Ozzy fan that I am.)ddition to the band for Scream is Rick Wakeman's son Adam on keyboards, but a good keyboardist does not make a great Heavy Metal band.<br /><br />Sorry, fans, just like Ozzy's last two studio albums, Scream just doesn't do it for me.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|A down right feel good movie. Three homeless folks find a baby in the dump on Christmas Eve night. They soon have to decide to take care of it, or turn it in. I won't spoil anything for you, but it becomes much bigger then that. The animation is nicely done, the music will keep you humming it even after the movie is over. The story just down right makes you feel good inside. I will definitely be showing my kids this movie, I've already shown my friends. A movie for all ages to watch and agree on.

Don't get me wrong, there's compelling conjecture aplenty in this one, but the common threads of intelligent practice, talent and good fortune (reinforced by the body's chemicals) seemed applicable, for lack of a better word.    i really enjoyed this book.  Definitely worth a look.
B000L212HW|5.0|It's been awhile since I've seen as good a fantasy story as this one is.  Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale are fantastic and present believeable performances in this man against dragon fantasy.  Izabella Scorupco is gorgeous and sexy and also gives a great performance.  The effects are out-of-this-world.  Even though set on a dark canvas, everything is crystal clear as only Blu-ray can deliver, not to mention the incredible sound.
1416955070|2.0|Slight spoilers in this one:<br />All right, before I go into the review I want to make it clear that I know of Cassandra Clare's past issues with claims of plagiarism. I know the full details, though I have not actually read The Draco Trilogy, and I don't ever intend to. I won't go into my opinions on that event because my goal is to be as unbiased and objective as possible with reading this book.<br />So, first off, the writing bugged me. I won't go into details, but basically a lot of the dialogue felt forced, unnatural, and repetitive. Plot points and general world information were given to us in awkward ways, it often seemed as though Cassandra Clare was trying to come off as casual but failed miserably. The purple prose got ridiculous at times, and there were scenes where the description was so badly done that I had to reread to make sure I was picturing things in my head correctly, which usually isn't a problem for me. Quite frankly, (and I'm cringing over saying this) it felt like fanfiction. Writing that resembles Cassandra Clare's is the reason I couldn't get into reading fanfiction in the first place. So many senteces were just so awkward, and unecessary. There was a lot of stuff in this book that didn't need to be there, causing it to be a lot bigger than it should have been.<br />The characters were all (or mostly all) typical and boring. Clary is a Mary Sue who manages to make people both love her and hate her upon first meeting her. I dislike Mary Sues heavily because I feel that they make nearly everything around them ridiculous. Characters like Isabelle and Alec, for example, become nothing but hostile beings when around Clary, which makes them unrealistic and boring. Actually, they're not the only characters that suddenly choose to hate another character right off the bat for stupid reasons. (This also means that lots of characters tend to snap at each inappropriately. Why am I nitpicking at that? Because it happens so often and it almost always seems unnatural and unwarranted.) Simon too seemed to hate Jace, and vice versa, as soon as he met him for what I assume is the same reason that Alec hated Clary almost immediately: jealousy. That's so typical, and makes the characters seem so childish that it's hard to take them seriously. Clary too turns against people really quickly, too quickly even for the slight attitude they've given her. It's one thing to stand your ground, it's another when you start throwing around personal insults. Considering some of the things she said or thought in regards to Alec and Isabelle throughout the book, I wonder if Claire was trying to make me admire Clary or trying to make me dislike her? She managed the latter.<br />There are some continuity bits that need to be checked out, because there were moments where some info was revealed, the characters were surprised, and I would be like, \\"Wait, didn't they find that out several chapters ago?\\" And when I flipped back and found the spot, it would turn out I was right. I know most people won't be bugged by that sort of thing, or most of the things I've noted in this review, but hey it bugs me, meaning it affects my overall enjoyment of the book.<br />I did, at the very least, like some of the mythology (or history depending on how you look at it) of some of the creatures in this book. For example, I liked the bits where angels are mentioned, not from a religious perspective, I just think stories with angels are interesting. Or biblical references in general, again not over something religious, I just find those stories interesting.<br />Actually, I did also like Isabelle. I didn't like certain parts she was in because I didn't like how she was used in those parts (like I mentioned above, to be hostile towards Clary or to give Clary someone to be mean to) but aside from that I found her to be interesting and I wish there had been more of her around. The spot that Isabelle holds is typical to that of any Mary Sue story, there's almostalways this other gorgeous girl that makes the Mary Sue feel self-conscious of her own looks until the Gary Stu tells the Mary Sue that her beauty is greater than that of the Beautiful But Hostile Girl. If you've read Twilight, think of Bella and Rosalie. See what I mean?<br />Simon was cool too, if I got to pick, Clary would end up with him, but I doubt that it will turn out that way. I don't get her attraction to Jace anyway. He's a prick, completely annoying and too \\"tortured\\" for my taste. Simon, on the other hand, was obviously sweet and not a total ass. Typical to have a YA book with a girl always choosing the \\"bad boy\\" though, even if he's not interesting at all.<br />While the writing was hard to ignore sometimes, I did think there were several bits that were funny... but then again there were also bits that were obviously meant to be funny and didn't quite make it there, and this also annoyed me because of the way Claire handled it. She kept having the characters, Clary and Jace in particular, set each other up for one-liners. There were moments were something serious was going on and they still had the time to stop and throw around some witty banter. Now and then this may be amusing, but to do it as often as she did it in this book just got annoying.<br />At first I wasn't too annoyed with the similarities between this book and so many other books/movies I've known in my life, but after a while it got to me. It was a mash up of a Harry Potter world with a Star Wars ending. I've read a lot of stories where things are very similar to things in other stories, but I'm fine with them if they're done well and in an original fashion. Valentine kept reminding me of Voldemort no matter how hard I tried for that not to happen, but there were just too many similarities with the addition of a family. The real difference is that I think Voldemort is an infinitely interesting and terrifying villain, whereas Valentine was boring and nothing more.<br />That ending! What kind of ending was that? I trudged through more than 400 pages and all I get to read about is the main guy being angsty while the villain gets away through a portal. Just do yourself a favor and don't read this book, it needs to go through the editing process a few more times before people should bother wasting any time on it.orgeous girl that makes the Mary Sue feel self-conscious of her own looks until the Gary Stu tells the Mary Sue that her beauty is greater than that of the Beautiful But Hostile Girl.

B0016BPWNM|5.0|I believe this is Jim Henson's last movie before his untimely end and it is a great one.  What can be more entertaining than muppet characters, a very young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie?  This movie is a feast for the eyes for both children and adults alike.  There is a wide variety of new muppet characters, one weirder than the next.  This movie is really good family entertainment.

B0016BWACI|5.0|I have always liked this movie and I had a copy on VHS.  It was dark and detail-less.  I purchased this Blu-Ray copy to replace my original and it is much better.  Colors are truer, more details are visible and, although it is set on a dark canvas, it was much easier to see everything even in the darkest frames.  Of course, the sound was incredible and much easier to hear even the slightest sound.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I don't know how I've ever existed on this planet without this film!  This film is WONDERFUL!  This film is perfectly casted, beautifully filmed/directed; the soundtrack is unforgetable, the film is hisorically informative and the film is one of the most touching love stories of all time.  Since receiving it I've watched it, perhaps, twelve times.  I can't get enough of it.  It's my 'go to film' if I want to relax, drift and be entertained.  I can find no fault with this film except that it, eventually, had to end.  A 'must have' film - and I fully give it a five star rating.
B003ELOQD4|2.0|It´s just like the subject. The techology in this show is almost unbelivable, worth watch it only for this.  U2..This one used to be one of my favourite band ever. Now they are a pale group with signs of patetism.  No hard feelings boys, think about leave the road.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and see something new each time!!! I know since I bought it I love to share it with friends because it is something about the mental control the boss has over the secretary that just makes my blood boil...    Simply stated a Great Movie!
B000A7X6WM|1.0|The album is a good one, anything special, but it´s ok.   The SACD is not good at all. It´s expensive and doesn´t worth the investment at all. I listened just once and don´t wan´t to play it again.  If you like Godffrapp buy the regular edition.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|There is no doubt about it; The Rolling Stones is the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world. Though this record was made almost 40 years (!) ago, it still gives you a thrill. This was a milestone in 1972 and holds its position even today. The alternate take on \\"Loving Cup\\" makes the hair stand up on my arms. It sort of mowes one down like a steam roller with its rumbling, rolling sound. What can I say more? I am at loss of words.    Just listen to it!
1439153663|5.0|Author Kathleen Grissom has given us an extraordinary book. \\"The Kitchen House\\" is the story of two women, one white and one black, but is a much bigger story than just families, black and white, and slave and free. \\"The Kitchen House \\"takes us up front and personal, face to face with those who populate a Virginia tobacco plantation late in the ninettenth century. There, we meet the beauty and the love of family and the ugliness and cruelty of damaged people of both races.<br /><br />The story opens with two white children whose parents have died on a ship headed for America. After the parents die, the captain indentures the children. The boy's whereabouts are lost to us, but the girl child is taken to the captain's plantation where she is put to work , despite her color (Irish-pale skin and carrot-colored hair), with slaves. In that milieu, author Grissom shows us the lives of those, the slaveholders and the bondaged, who form the backbone and do the labor responsible for a profitable tobacco plantation. As young Lavinia learns her role--for much of the book she does the work--as a slave, and is unaware that she is not a slave. The plot is further complicated by the cruelty almost demanded to keep human beings in chains a well as the emotional and physical price of doing so. Frequently harsh is the sexual license granted to masters with their powerless chattel, as is not infrequent drug and alcohol abuse. What is truly amazing about this book is that the author holds all these complicated strands together without becomng maudlin or melodramatic--the characters are well developed and grow with the plot. Thus the believability of this character-driven novel keeps us turning pages, holding our breaths to see what happens next.<br /><br />It is the development of characters that most fascinates me about \\"The Kitchen House\\". Author Grissom, with a profound understanding of human psyche and motivation, slowly skillfully builds her characters in ways that are never implausable and never cardboard, all good or all bad. When they are bad or good, we understand why they are so, even when we despise what they do. Her uncanny use of \\"voice\\"\\", unerringly accurate, is always just right, never off key. She accomplishes this partially by presenting the character stories in alternative chapters as if by different characters. This device allows her to present each of them in their own words and points of view. When that bonds with empathy, the reader is held spellbound, locking into the narrative, rooting for the success of the novel's protagonist and cursing the less than admirable villains.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend Kathlesn Grissom's superb novel, \\"The Kitchen House\\" for all those who enjoy well-crafted, faithfully presented history in a gripping tale of familial love and relationships among people in a slaveholding society. Brava! Five Stars! And more if the system offered higher ratings.cardboard, all good or all bad. When they are bad or good, we understand why they are so, even when we despise what they do.

When that bonds with empathy, the reader is held spellbound, locking into the narrative, rooting for the success of the novel's protagonist and cursing the less than admirable villains.       I wholeheartedly recommend Kathlesn Grissom's superb novel, \\"The Kitchen House\\" for all those who enjoy well-crafted, faithfully presented history in a gripping tale of familial love and relationships among people in a slaveholding society. Brava! Five Stars! And more if the system offered higher ratings.

B003ICWTTM|5.0|Can't wait to get my blu ray.  Of course it won't be the same as seeing Bruce and the E street band live.  Theres something about his shows that can't be conveyed through video.  Was a little sad that I'm On Fire didnt make the cut, but I guess everybody has a Springsteen favorite.  Have already told my wife the living room is mine tomorrow night for 3 hours.  Shes endured two Springsteen shows by my side.  The high def is gonna be awesome..........Springsteen Forever
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Update:  After about 11 months of use, the reader pretty much cracked and stopped working. Given that it's such a small device, and on my key chain all the time, this still seems like a reasonable lifespan. It still protected the memory card, so I was able to reuse it when I got a new reader. I regardless, I'm going to continue to recommend this just because of how small it is, but I suppose you just have to be aware that it's more fragile than I initially thought.      I've had this since January, which means that I've been using it for around 6 months.  It has worked flawlessly. I keep it on a keychain with other keys and it is always in my pocket, which means that it is subject to some pretty harsh conditions.  However, it has held up very well.  The black paint (which says kingston) has all worn off, but it has exposed a nice silver-metal color.  The body appears to be mostly made out of metal.     Reliability is really based upon which microsd card you choose to use with it. Currently, I have an 8gb card.  But if you have an unreliable card in the device, then the device will obviously appear to be malfunctioning even if it is not.      My only advice, and this is based upon personal experience with other products, is to apply a few drops of liquid super glue to the knot at the end of the lanyard. This will prevent it from coming undone and possibly allowing your reader to come free from your keychain.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I bought this because I needed something that could track my heart rate accurately during my workouts and wanted the extra GPS flexibility that doesn't come standard with the Polar devices. It's a very solid device for monitoring your heart rate, though some [[ASIN:B0002CA8RQ Spectra 360 Electrode Gel Parker Labs, Each 250GM Tube]] will come in handy for getting a good heart signal.    The GPS is outstanding, it tracks just fine under heavy tree cover and in other environments where lesser GPS' would lose signal. The only major downside that I've found is that you can only enter waypoints or view your location using deg/min/sec, and I find it much easier to work with UTM references. Hopefully Garmin will fix that in a firmware upgrade. You can of course enter waypoints on your PC and upload them to the device, but it's good enough that it's replacing my etrex on short hikes and it'd be nice to more easily cross reference with a topo map.    It also integrates nicely with Garmin Connect and lets you publish your trail details - here's one of my hikes [..]    You can configure the ANT wireless to automatically download your track and heart rate data when the device is within range of your PC. It's definitely the easiest GPS i've ever had for accessing my trail data.    The battery life isn't wonderful, but it does charge from a standard USB connector so it's easy to keep charged when you travel.
0307454541|5.0|A very engaging mystery. The characters are interesting and likable. The titular girl character grabs you from nearly the first instant you meet her and you'll be racing to read the next volume when you've finished this. OH, but be forewarned that there are some disturbing sexual crimes in the story (and the second book too).

B0015HOFZI|4.0|Did not order this from Amazon but the vendor I ordered it from does not have on-line reviews, so I am reviewing it here. I purchased it for $89.00 and at that sale price, it was well worth the money. The hitch, as others have said, is the really substandard software that comes with the unit. I recall having read about other USB turntables that don't even include software -- they just direct the user to download the free recording software Audacity. This is what Sony should have done with this unit. I installed the provided software -- monkeyed around with the terribly written instructions -- used the non-intuitive software -- then opened Audacity and it recorded with no problems. Audacity does take some effort to get the speakers to play back in real time as you're recording -- I found the following suggestion on an Audacity forum that was very helpful to me:  \\"Audacity > Preferences > Audio I/O > Recording > those check boxes down there at the bottom. Each computer is slightly different so you have to try different combinations. It's useful to restart Audacity after you change one of those settings.\\" I did this and once that was accomplished, I uninstalled the Sony software and will never use it again. Those new to Audacity will still have a learning curve -- you have to install the LAME encoder to convert to MP3. But it's extremely easy to use once you get through the learning phase. The turntable is just fine -- interface works well and the unit is easy to operate. And as others have mentioned, the recordings sound very impressive. I was very pleased with the results. Some of my recordings have scratches and pops but that makes me nostalgic for the old days when I would just wear out certain vinyl records that I loved. :) My only regret is that I didn't order this sooner. Now I'll be shopping at thrift stores again for old vinyl. Great way to save money and digitize your beloved recordings.

0891419063|5.0|Anyone who, like me, watched and enjoyed the Hanks/Speilberg series 'The Pacific\\" should obtain and read this book. Apart from anything, it will show them how closely the series followed the truth of this personal history by one of the principle characters, Private Sledge.<br />It is quite shocking and although I have had a lifelong interest in military history, I have never before taken such an interest in the Pacific campaign. It must surely rate as the most brutal, bestial, and shocking conflict in human history.It was absolutely 'medieval' in its brutality, conducted with modern weaponary.<br />The simple and understated report of events experienced by the author make it all the more shocking. Little wonder the number of (Battle Fatigue) PTSD cases on Okinawa was over 20,000!<br />You won't regret buying this book
B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD is probably one of the best early Britney Spears CDs ever released.

B003CN5SAY|4.0|I've only watched the first 2 episodes of the 6th and final season of nip/tuck, but from what i've seen, this season is more exciting, funnier and just as dark as season 5!<br />The packaging is attractive and it comes with a booklet, and from what i've heard, the special features are good.<br />So if you've followed the show and bought the other seasons, this is definitely worth the purchase.<br />If you're a first time buyer of the show but love what you've seen and heard about it, i'd recommend buying the first 3 or 4 seasons, and seeing if you really like the show first because it does change quite alot from the get go in season 5, and personally.. i couldnt decide whether i liked it as much from that point, but i quickly got used to it and grew to love it.<br />Other's however have not liked the show since the end of season 4, and wont even be bothering with purchasing season 6.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This album is not only inspiring and emotional, it is really REALLY well made. The artists who collaborate work in perfect harmony, despite being from varying cultures.

I cannot recommend this album enough!
B00338QENI|5.0|I do not think I have ever read a book like this.

B001EN71DG|4.0|Would have been nice to know the original wasn't cleaned up. IE some areas I had the urge to get up and clean the TV screen.  Otherwise Great product.
B0007939NO|3.0|I loved every minute of this film when I saw it in my local movie house when I was a kid.  I bought the DVD to regain old magic.  It just wasn't there.  The filming on a sound stage is not a problem, especially when you think the whole premise of Brigadoon is a fantasy.  But Gene Kelly really doesn't sing very well and his acting talent is minimal at best. Van Johnson is under utilized in this movie, but his performance is so under nuanced it is kind of embarrassing.  I know he was a better actor than you see in this movie.<br />My biggest disappointment was the choice by Vincent Minelli to cut \\"Come to Me, Bend to Me\\" out of the final production.  You can watch it in the outtakes and I guess it was eliminated because it is sung by a secondary character (but a much better singer than Gene Kelly.)<br />For me, the most fun was the ensemble number, \\"Bonnie Jean.\\"  Watching Kelly and Johnson doing a soft shoe was worth the whole movie.Watching Kelly sand dance to \\"Almost Like Being in Love\\" is almost as good.<br />Cyd Charisse looks lovely, dances divinely and is totally out of place as a Scottish lass, but that was Hollywood.<br />The movie is a period piece from a time when Scotland, heather, and Hollywood were all as unattainable and magical  as a sophisticated nightclub in New York City.  I think this is the real charm of this movie, the memory of our innocence.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|If you loved the original Clash of the Titans you will absolutely hate this remake. You'll hate this remake even if you DIDN'T see the original. I've seen B horror movies better than this.<br /><br />Why? In no particular order...<br /><br />1. The dialogue is campy. I saw this in the theater (waste of money), and the audience was laughing at parts that weren't meant to be funny, because they couldn't believe this made it out for public viewing.<br /><br />2. The cheesy comedic relief characters are stereotypical, completely pointless, and stupid. The original didn't need comedic relief characters to keep the audience somewhat entertained because IT WAS AWESOME. (and it had the owl!)<br /><br />3. There is hardly any resemblence to the Greek mythology- granted, the original wasn't 100% accurate but it didn't stray so far or make up/add so many disparate elements (wooden djinns? really?).<br /><br />4. When Perseus is riding Pegasus on city streets (when they are using a real horse versus the flying CGI one) the folded wings look like something a highschool student could make at home and attach to a horse. You'd think they'd use some of their special-effects budget to make more than a half-hearted attempt. I guess they used it all up on Hades.<br /><br />6. Medusa is entirely CGI. Not my biggest gripe about her. In the original she was ugly, just like she is suppose to be according to the mythology. In the remake they even briefly go over the story of Medusa, how she was changed from a beautiful woman to a horribly ugly monster...then they proceed to contradict themselves with her- she has the upper body/face of a playboy bunny (with snake hair albeit), and a snake lower body. Horrific monster? Hardly.<br /><br />The only two things I liked about this movie was how Hades would appear (don't EVEN get me started on how they decided to throw the original's storyline out concerning him), and the Kraken. That's it.<br />I wouldn't even really deign to call this a remake- it changes the storyline completely, and the only thing they have in common is the characters' names. I mean c'mon, where's Bobo the owl? Oh yeah, Perseus picks him up out of box, asks what it is, and throws him back in the box.<br /><br />This was physically painful for me to sit through. I guess Laim Neeson and Ralph Fiennes had to pay some bills, because I can't imagine why else they would agree to be in this POS.it changes the storyline completely, and the only thing they have in common is the characters' names.

0451191153|5.0|I read the Fountainhead after reading [[ASIN:0195324870 Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]] .  I believe this is a good starting point for Ayn Rand.  I wanted to know her belief system before reading any of her material.  This made The Fountainhead easier to understand. This is a book about an architect fighting to make it in society. This is also a book about individualism and the greatness of the individual.  Many people have written in-depth analysis about the novel so I will not do the same.  This is the foundation novel by Ayn Rand, which established her as a writer and eventually led to her masterpiece Atlas Shrugged.  The story of a man against society was nothing new to novels.  The manner in which Rand compared individualism to collectivism was a new idea.  Rand was heavily influenced early in life by the effects of Communism on her family.  Rand did not hide her disdain for collectivism in The Fountainhead.  The timing of this book coincided with the Great Depression and the invention of the modern Welfare state.  Her book said many things that people did not say at this time.  The relevancy of this book will never fade as long as government wants to intervene in our lives and redistribute \\"wealth\\".<br />This book will always stay in my short list of great novels.  However, Rand added so much detail to the book there were times when I did not want to continue reading.  She made sure the reader understood everything about her main characters.  At times, I did not care about childhood of some of the characters.  Rand did make the book strong as a whole and the slow parts were only minor bumps in the road.  The slow parts eventually led to good parts. The good parts would lead to reading for several hours nonstop.
081297381X|1.0|I read the first two chapters and was put off by how much this book needs a good editor.  He is clearly very arrogant, but he can't write.  It made me feel ill.  So I skipped ahead to Ch 15, hoping that some of the 'original' ideas could be found.  I haven't found anything original or even useful.  Those who are familiar with non-Gaussian distributions and fat tails should stay away.     I would like to see a properly edited version so I can stomach it, but, given the success of this one, I'm sure it will never happen.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, WINTER'S BONE immediately sparked comparisons to last year's Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker.  Both films received limited runtime in theaters.  But I must say this is by far the superior movie in just about every aspect imaginable, unless you count overwrought machoism, slanted anti-war sentiments, and explosions as a category.  Don't get me wrong, The Hurt Locker was a decent film for what it was.  But it won't leave the kind of lasting impression like this story will.<br /><br />When you hear the word \\"backwoods\\", you might get the immediate impression of inbred, buck-toothed hillbillies wearing overalls and drinking moonshine.  This story doesn't succumb to exploiting certain exaggerated stereotypes just to grab your attention.  But these characters are definitely a little rough around the edges, to say the least.<br /><br />Filmed in the Ozarks of Missouri, this is a simple but riveting dramatic tale about family, danger, and perseverance.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17-year-old girl forced to grow up way too fast.  With her mother desperately ailing and her father somewhere hiding from the law, she struggles to support her younger brother and sister.  To make matters worse, a bail bondsman notifies her that her dad put up their home as his bail bond, then skipped out on court.  In order to track her father down, Ree is forced to enter a seedy, violent realm of paranoid drug pushers and users.  Many of them happen to be distant family members.  Family ties or not, none of them are too anxious to help her out.  The risks and desperation mount as she inches closer to the truth.<br /><br />The best part of this film is the character development and the acting.  It is so refreshing to see the young cast perform their roles with such controlled precision.  Especially Lawrence.  She puts many established Hollywood actors to shame here, I can't wait to see more of her work.<br /><br />WINTER'S BONE is slow paced, and might not appeal to many casual movie goers.  But it does have some moments of heightened tension that will leave you holding your breath.  It explores a certain drug culture and meager lifestyle that is rarely touched upon in movies.  Plus it makes some poignant, thought-provoking points about family devotion and the human spirit.<br /><br />It also was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.  I doubt there will be a better film than this all year.  Brilliant filmmaking.asual movie goers.  But it does have some moments of heightened tension that will leave you holding your breath.

1594488843|4.0|Managers have long been interested in improving the performance of their staff. The traditional  approach to motivating employees was the carrot and stick model. If you perform well, you are tangibly rewarded with a higher salary or bonuses (the carrot). If you do not perform to expectations, you are at risk of demotion or losing your position (the stick).<br /><br />However, as we all know from our own experiences, traditional strategies may not be what motivates us, and therefore our employees, colleagues or superiors. In his book Drive, Daniel Pink investigates what science has been telling us for the past 40 years about motivation. If you have studied psychology on your path to becoming a healthcare professional, like many of us have, the research will probably not be new to you. Daniel has not done his own empirical research into motivation, but highlighted that there is a significant disconnect between the evidence base in motivation and the tools (carrot and stick) the business world use to motivate people. Interestingly, although this research has come from our own backyard, are we as health professionals also missing the opportunity to motivate our clients by using strategies identified within the psychological evidence-base? Additionally, are we as an industry designing healthcare practitioner positions around the principles to motivate us to achieve our best?<br /><br />Something you will not get from reading the original papers which Pink refers to, is the strong connection of the science to the business world. No, Dan Pink is not a scientist or what the scientific community would classify as an expert in motivation, but there is no argument about his ability as a writer and an expert in marrying research with real-world applications and experiences.<br /><br />Drive acknowledges that although we need to pay employees at a reasonable rate, the three areas most likely to motivate them are 1. Autonomy, 2. Purpose, and 3. Progress.<br /><br />***Relevance to Healthcare Professionals***<br /><br />From a content point of view, Drive identifies that what we have traditionally thought would motivate people, may in fact not be as effective as we imagine. His three areas identified as sources of motivation may be transferrable in motivating our clients to make positive changes or continue to progress positively towards their health goals.<br /><br />From a communication point of view, how Pink intertwines the research, his ideas, and case studies to make a story that can be easily read and understood without having to understand scientific jargon is impressive. It is a great example for any of us, who as Healthcare Practitioners are trying to translate the science into prose that will engage the average reader - and ultimately those who we wish to motivate to make better choices about their health.*    From a content point of view, Drive identifies that what we have traditionally thought would motivate people, may in fact not be as effective as we imagine.

0345479092|3.0|This book is ok.  I bought it because my 2 month old wasn't sleeping a wink during the day, and it was driving both of us bonkers.  Although it has some good advice, and idealistically her \\"EASY\\" approach (eat, activity, sleep, you) is an excellent idea, it just didn't translate well into real-life, for me anyway.  For example, my daughter always got really sleepy after eating and I didn't want to fight her natural inclinations.  So I kinda switched it to \\"ESYA,\\" but she still didn't get much \\"sleep\\" so I didn't get much \\"you,\\" aka \\"me\\" time, which all new moms know is important, even if it's just 15 minutes a day.  It did help us to get some kind of structure, and nobody expects total structure (or anything close to it) in those early months anyway.  I think it was still worth reading, and since every baby is different it might be perfect for you.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|At first, I purchased the box set for $139 through an Amazon partner. Characteristics:<br /><br />* Six smaller albums within, each containing several DVDs, individually wrapped in plastic. The DVDs were held into place using cardboard tabs.<br />* Two CDs of music (normally sold separately.)<br />* A printed piece of paper was affixed to the back of the red box. This paper did not easily detach, and so I did not do so for fear of marring the box further.<br />* The six smaller albums had questionable print quality on the outside. The tabs were frustrating to place DVDs into.<br />* When removed, the plastic wrapping on each DVD marred the surface of the discs in spots and caused problems when playing on multiple devices.<br /><br />I would have kept it despite the other flaws, but the playback issues were unacceptable. The partner was good about giving me my money back, including return postage.<br /><br />Amazon then had a sale on the product for $99, not involving a partner. I decided to take a chance and try again. This item had the following characteristics:<br /><br />* Same six albums contained within, but much better print quality. Also, each DVD was held in a pocket, and no plastic covering on each DVD.<br />* The printed piece of paper came off of the red box very easily, and it looks great.<br />* The two audio CDs were omitted. No great loss to me, but some might miss them.<br />* This version included a nice book with photos and various piecs of information.<br />* No playback issues!<br /><br />The bottom line is to make sure, if you're getting it from an Amazon partner (or someone outside of the Amazon ecosystem), to ensure that you receive the revised edition.

B001GCUO5M|1.0|I cringed throughout most of the movie, not because it was a thriller, but because of the rampant stupidity throughout. To be sure, there are a lot of visual scenes which are rivetting, but the plot itself is laughable. It amazes me that after a century of making films, Hollywood still cannot portray mental illness in an accurate manner. The \\"hallucinations,\\" the \\"radical therapy,\\" the sanitarium for \\"the criminally insane\\" are all laughable and as far from reality as can possibly be. The trailers/previews of the films were actually better and more promising than the actual film. Oh, well.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|I'm taking this moment to redeem my last review from the New Moon soundtrack.  I was not smart in the fact that I posted the review probably a day after I first listened to the CD and I'm sorry to say I didn't give it the justice and credit it truly deserved.  I wasn't born a fan of Indie music.  As another reviewer has stated, you need to take some time to approach this particular style.  If you don't, you'd probably turn away from it after the first listen.  But after some time and hitting replay many many times over, the New Moon soundtrack turned out to the be one of my favorite compilation of songs I have ever come across.  I still listen to it over and over, even a year later.  And now, I was so excited for this new Eclipse soundtrack.  I kept thinking - \\"Please have indie! Please have indie!\\"  (diehard fan now people...it happens).  And...it does kind of sort of have indie...but not really.  This CD has a more of an alternative, edgy feel to it - especially with songs like \\"Chop and Change\\" and \\"Rolling In On A Burning Tire.\\"  And you know?  I kind of love it.  It's like I've been transported inside Jacob's head.  Although the only drawback I'd say is this:  yes, new moon was probably the saddest storyline and I thought the score of the film fit perfectly.  But Eclipse has always been the more tragic of all four books.  Maybe it's because I'm a Jacob fan, but really, he's hurting folks!  And there's a bitter edge to him now as he is so hopelessly in love with Bella.  So in this soundtrack, I wish there were a little more tragedy to it.  I definitely felt some of it in the beautiful track \\"My Love\\" and then especially in the haunting melody of \\"Jacob's theme.\\"  I can picture the direction the score will take and I think I will be quite pleased, thank you.

B003K5ZQGU|4.0|This movie surprised me!  It ended up being a very good movie. Appreciated the insight into a period of British history that has perhaps consisted of more lore in movie treatment rather than real history. Costumes are beautiful and the whole movie is a feast for the eyes. Highly recommended for those who like both history and romance.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|For years Eminem has only had his pain and anger from the problems with his mother and ex wife to rap about. Now that he has went through the hardships of life and gotten all of that out of the way he's rapping about real things. I have been a lifetime fan of Mathers, I have never fully hated any of his albums yet at the same time I felt he was just dragging on his effort. I do not buy many cds anymore but after hearing a few of the songs on this album I rushed out and bought it. Eminem in my humble opinion is now better than he ever has been and it shows in the production and effort he put into this album.     1. Cold Wind Blows 8/10: Eminem tries to be a bit comical while still hard in this track and does a decent job of both. Good song but not great.    2. Talkin' 2 Myself ft. Kobe 10/10: This song is very engrossing and draw you into singing the chorus along with Kobe. I never heard of this guy before but the track was very effective and enjoyable.     3. On Fire 4/10: Not going to say anything bad about this track however, it does not have a very good feel to it for me. Make your own assesment.    4. Won't Back Down ft. Pink 8/10: This song is a very good collaboration between the two of them. However I think the choice of Eminem to add in Pink after the track was recorded was a bad idea as it just doesn't quite mix.     5. W.T.P. 7/10: Old school Eminem type song yet you can tell he put some effort into making his rhymes meaningful unlike older songs where he simply made us feel stupid for listening to it.    6. Going Through Changes 11/10: This song was simply amazingly put together. First of all you'll notice the sampling of Ozzy in this song. It was a suprise to me but it melds pefectly and makes the track flawless.    7. Not Afraid 9/10: This song has been played heavily on MTV and other music networks. I felt this song was a very good way to put the new song and feel out there for fans to know Eminem was back and ontop once again.     8. Seduction 6/10: Not one of my favorites but it sill has a catch sound to it. It is alledgedly about Mariah Carey but regardless it gets your attention.    9. No Love ft. Lil Wayne 9/10: The only reason I did not make this a 10/10 is because I had mixed emotions about this song from the start. At first I did not like it feeling the two didn't really mix, but then after listening more closely I found myself listening and singing along.     10. Space Bound 10/10: One of my absolute favorites on the album. This song is totally out of the norm for Eminem and many will proably say it's soft and not him. That's just it though Eminem is not the same he has evolved and this is a great example. It's different yes, but it works and he set the track on fire.    11. Cinderella Man 11/10: The only other song I rate 11/10 because it has such a flow that you just can't help yourself but listen. I love the rhythm and his rhymes are sick. Great track.    12. 25 to Life 9/10: This song has a good feel and it seems he put alot of emotion into it while recording. The female vocals add alot to it aswell and makes for an overall awesome track.    13. So Bad 6/10: Decent lyrics yet for some reason the song doesn't quite feel the same as the rest almost like a filler track. I do not however, find myself skipping over it so it was a success.    14. Almost Famous 10/10: This track just makes me wanna get up and start moshing or moving in some sort of way. The beat is sick and mad props to the producer. The lyrics are very good as well as he takes many shots at himself for his previous failures in music.    15. Love The Way You Lie ft Rihanna 9/10: Another one of my favorites Rihanna and Eminem sound perfect together and this song puts me in a great state of mind. Not to mention this is the melding of my favorite male and female artists what could be better!    16. You're Never Over 10/10: This gets a 10 because it is a very heart filled and melodic tribute to Proof of D12. Eminem made an effort to tribute Proof every chance he had. This song was not at all hard to listen to and may possibly have meaning to others.    17. Untitled (Here We Go) 5/10: Not quite sure why this song was added but it was not a good choice to put right after You're Never Over. However it was put together well and was quite decent.    All together this Album was well produced and written and therefore I give the overall album a 10/10. I recommend this to any Eminem fans new and old. If you have given up on him because of past albums not having quite that Eminem feel then pick this up and give him another chance it will not dissapoint you. It will appeal to all types of fans, it has melodic vocals (yes even Eminem singing) but it also has the hardcore anger type rapping so just give it a listen. I have forgiven all faults by Eminem after hearing his effort and his apologetic nature for Relapse which only had a few decent tracks. Eminem has cleaned up his life and is now making the music we all knew he could. So to Eminem and everyone he works with I say.    Great job and welcome back you are forgiven. SLIM SHADY!!!!!!!!!!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I knew this was going to be a great movie just seeing the previews and hearing about the story, and it was! I love Sandra since Speed and she was awesome! Tim McGraw was good too playing her hubby. Definately a truly inspiring, uplifting movie that all can watch!
B000W1V7K4|3.0|Ocean's 13 is a great movie.  If you like the previous Ocean's films, you will like this one.    The transfer to Blu-ray was very poorly done.  The picture is not that great and the sound is just okay.  There's really no value to paying extra for the Blu-Ray, because the soundtrack is merely Dolby Digital.  Any decent Blu-ray player should be capable of upscaling the DVD to give you adequate picture -- you aren't going to get much better from this Blu-ray disc anyway!

1573223085|3.0|In a nutshell, this book gives a succinct set of problems and solutions for succeeding in the future    PROBLEMS:   Abundance - hundreds of options for any situation (classic example: grocery stores)  Asia - billions of people providing cheap labor  Automation - We don't need a lot of people to do build anything anymore    SOLUTIONS:  Design - make it cool (see Apple computer)  Story - a compelling narrative wins the day  Symphony - see the big picture and synthesize better solutions  Empathy - understand fellow humans to provide what they need  Play - we all need to play  Meaning - help people pursue purpose, transcendence, and spiritual fulfillment    According to the author, the requirements to succeeding in the future involve developing and engaging your RIGHT BRAIN accomplish the solutions mentioned above. Not to say using your LEFT BRAIN isn't important, but that you need to use them EQUALLY,whereas in recent decades industry has mostly emphasized use of your left brain.    I found myself skimming the book a lot. It's largely based on a handful of examples and lots of conjecture. Nothing really earth shattering IMO, but food for thought.
B002ZG983M|1.0|I was very disappointed in this move.  To much blood and guts and really foul language.  If it had served a purpose I could understand.  The language, etc... serve only as a  shock value.  It didn't have much of a plot or moral.  Save your money.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|I was pretty dissapointed when I first heard that Zakk wasn't in the Ozzy Osbourne band anymore. Later it was announced that Gus G was his replacement, which I taught it may work. After hearing a few songs, Ozzy didn't make a bad choice of guitarist change. The songs on this album sound diffrent from previous albums. I hope though when Ozzy makes a final album, brings Zakk back home and end with him.
0307454541|5.0|The pages when it talked about the Wennerstrom scandal was a bit boring and could've been summed up in a paragraph.  Everything else is exciting.

0316168815|5.0|I had heard the great review for this book but had also heard the poor reviews on the movie, so this was a great way to start reading the book in a neutral state. I've always been intrigued by serial killers (Ted Bundy, Jack the Ripper, and perhaps now Joran van der Sloot), so that part was alternately fascinating and repulsive. The part that surprised me the most was the way I reacted to Susie looking down at everyone from heaven. Having lost my father less than two years ago, I wanted to see what someone who might be in Heaven feels and thinks and experiences -- and that's where the tears came in. As a married mother of two, I completely connected with Mr. and Mrs. Salmon and the way that the grief of losing a child tore the marriage apart. I agree with some of the other reviewers who felt the ending was a bit forced, and the demise of Mr. Harvey was something that left a lot to be deserved in terms of justice. The grandmother was a complete hoot and the school friends added layers and nuances that only added to the story. I wouldn't give the story an A+, but that fact that it was so different in terms of the storytelling angle puts it in at least the \\"A\\" range.
1439148953|5.0|I have liked all the books I've read by T&oacute;ib&iacute;n. Not as enthusiastic as most about The Master (I liked David Lodge's novel about Henry James better--though I think absolutely nobody agreed with me.) I loved Blackwater Lightship. T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's take on the psychology of all the characters is perfect in this novel about a family crisis when the mother, grandmother and sister of a young man come to terms with his homosexuality and ultimately his final days with AIDS. That emotional authenticity I found also in Brooklyn: A Novel.<br /><br />Eilis Lacey is the main character and it just occurs to me that T&oacute;ib&iacute;n handles this point of view with a technique \\"the master\\" called Centre of Consciousness, meaning it's a third person narrative but one that sees the world only from the character's point of view. James described it as looking through a hole in the head of the character so you see the world as that person sees it.<br /><br />It's the 1950ies in a small town of Enniscorthy in Country Wexford, Ireland. Eilis lives with her mother and older sister, Rose. She's shy and awkward and feels insecure because she's not been able to get a job. Rose on the other hand has a responsible job, dresses well, is socially assured and plays golf every weekend. She advises Eilis on clothes and boy friends and jobs. Eilis looks up to her so when Rose talks to a priest from Brooklyn about job possibilities for her, Eilis goes along and before she knows it she's on the ship in third class and sick as a dog in the worst storm of the season.<br /><br />Eilis' story must be a typical one from a single woman coming from Ireland, supported by an Irish priest in an Irish parish where \\"strangers\\" are mostly those from different parts of Ireland. It's a narrow world, but not as narrow as the small town in Ireland for she meets Jews and Italians and other immigrants. The priest finds her an Irish landlady and a job as a shopgirl. Initially Eilis is nearly overcome with loneliness and home sickness until the priest enrolls her at Brooklyn College learning bookkeeping and commercial law. She's bright and does well and her studies provide the interest she hadn't initially had.<br /><br />At a parish dance, Eilis, still shy and gawky, meets Tony, born in Brooklyn of Italian parents. He's gentle and respectful and obviously in love with her, though there are hints that what Tony has in mind for the future (marriage, a house and construction business on Long Island, raising Dodgers fans) might not be enough for Eilis who's got more intelligence and more curiosity than Tony.<br /><br />When Eilis returns to Ireland after a family tragedy, Tony persuades her to marry him secretly before she leaves. But back home, no longer so shy or unsure of herself, with American clothes and a tan, Eilis, who hasn't told her mother about her relationship with Tony, is a social success, courted by the very man who'd ignored her before. Now she is in danger of really falling in love and a role for her at home in Enniscorthy lies open before her. She doesn't open Tony's letters. Until a gossip who's been on the phone with her landlady threatens to spill the beans.<br /><br />The emotional truth of this novel is perfect.

0393072231|2.0|I actually enjoyed the book though I think the title is terrible. More imagination needed there.     I won't review the book as 500 other people have already done that, but I want to ask a question: Was I the only one who was put off by Lewis using the word 'like' (continually) in a way that, here in England, only teenage girls have adopted?  Whenever someone (anyone really) is being quoted they seem to say 'I was like.....' or 'he was like....' as a way of introducing what was said. Now I do know a few people who speak like that, but not many, and they are all girl friends of my young daughter. Surely everyone in this book can't talk that way.
1400052173|5.0|In 1951 a woman died in Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore of cervical cancer. The cancer had been \\"particularly virulent\\", and though she was treated with the latest protocols for cervical cancer, she never had much of a chance. A surgeon at Hopkins took samples of her tumor and put the cells in a petri dish for researchers trying to cultivate human cells in the laboratory. These cells grew and reproduced as no other before and few since had done and they have been used by researchers ever since. They came along just in time to provide the medium for testing the first polio vaccine and have been \\"workhorse\\" cells ever since, used in research on herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's, lactose intolerance, sexually transmitted diseases , and much more--even the effect on human cells of working in sewers.<br /><br />The woman was Henrietta Lacks. She was black and poor, the descendent of slaves and sharecroppers who grew tobacco in Maryland and Virginia. Her cells, according to conventions of the time, were called HeLa (first two letters of first and last name). The researchers at Hopkins shared the cells with colleagues at other institutions and those researchers shared or sold them further. They survived just fine sent in the mail it was discovered. Soon HeLa cells were used all over the world and far more HeLa cells existed than Henrietta Lacks had ever had. It was years before the discovery that her tumor was HPV, the fast growing cervical cancer which young girls are advised to get a vaccine for now, and that that accounted for their \\"immortality\\".<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot heard this story in a college class and found a passion as she attempted to understand how it happened that so much medical research depended on the cells of a single woman but also who this woman was, how she had lived and what descendents she had left. She was not the first researcher interested in HeLa and the woman who was the tissue donor--though of course \\"donor\\" is probably not the correct term since Henrietta Lacks was never consulted. And many of those who wrote about HeLa also tried to find Henrietta's family with the result that the Lacks, who grew up on stories of the Tuskegee Institute syphilis research[1] and rumors that Hopkins--founded as a charity hospital-- kidnapped black people at night and subjected them to hideous medical experiments, suspected on the one hand that Henrietta might have been tortured or even killed and on the other resented the fact that others had made money off her cells and they had got nothing. So they either refused to talk to reporters or researchers or they ranted about the commercialization of their relative's cells which had benefitted everyone but them.<br /><br />Rebecca set her sights on Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, and spent 10 years getting to know her and the family Henrietta had left and attempting to help them get recognition for a relative who had provided so much to medical science. The result is a fascinating book in which Skloot tells the story of the Lacks family as well as the story of the HeLa cells and their role in medical research and the evolving medical ethics story surrounding the use of human tissue in research. The relationship Skloot developed with the Lacks was extraordinary: she overcame endless suspicions of white people, reporters, researchers, profiteers, etc. to become a real friend to Deborah and her family. She tells their story in their own voices--and clearly it was not easy to both explain their ideas and feelings and clearly communicate their values to the audience, nor was it easy to gain their trust and cooperation. I can't imagine many writers going to the lengths Skloot went to get a story that nevertheless honors and doesn't exploit those whose story it is. Winning over the Lacks klan required more than most writers would be willing to give of themselves.<br /><br />In addition Skloot provides lively and engaging narrative, full of interesting personalities, that results from her  extensive research on the use of human cells in medical research and the ethical issues surrounding that use. I couldn't put the book down--and before reading this I'd never have said I was very interested in either cell research or medical ethics.<br /><br />Most readers will probably be surprised to learn that while medical ethics, especially protecting the privacy of patents has come a long way since Henrietta Lacks' cells first appeared on the scene, it is still not illegal for human tissue to be used without the informed consent of the patient. It's an ongoing debate on which Skloot presents a variety of positions so that the readers understand the complexity of the issues involved.<br /><br />For a nonfiction book on a significant current topic, this one can't be beat. It's a page turner, full of human interest but never at the expense of the facts or the issues.<br /><br />[1] The Tuskegee Syphilis Study is one of the most horrendous examples of research carried out in disregard of basic ethical principles of conduct.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Well this album rocks my world, breath of fresh air production wise and love both rap and now reggae. Perfect combo, just one thing, on 'As we enter' did someone forget to edit out the cat that strolled in their studio or something. Like wtf there is a constant Miaow! Listen to it again, its very distracting lol.  Anyway I love it, get people listening to good music y'all! I'll see you both in Manchester next month!!!!
1586638491|5.0|As one reviewer noted this 'translation' is suspect in some places<br /><br />Though I might almost agree with that assessment (doesn't any translation have it's detractors?), at the same time the original text is right there for you to examine on your own, and these 'No Fear' editions simply are the BEST way to make Shakespeare accessible!  I LOVED this book and can't recommend it enough - I went back and bought 'Midsummer Night's Dream' and can't wait to read it!
B00275EHJG|4.0|This third Toy Story was a winner.  The story is a great continuation that spoke to my older son as he outgrows his once beloved Woody & Buzz and still fascinates my younger one.<br /><br />This movie centers around Andy, all grown up, going away to college and having to clean out his bedroom.  Should he donate his old toys? Throw them out?  Or keep them in the attic for his children?  Woody, Buzz and a few other toys that have survived over the years try one last time to get Andy to play with them.  Their failure makes them think they are doomed for the trash pile and rather then suffer this horrible fate, they plot to get into the donate box. Woody insists that Andy intends for them to be stored in the attic but the others do not believe him.<br /><br />Their arrival at Sunnyside playschool makes them think they've hit the jackpot but all is not as rosy as it seems.  There is a dark undercurrent here, lead by a strawberry smelling stuffed bear.  This brought cries of horror from my youngest along with lots of questions.  Did that mean the toys we donated were being treated horribly too?  Although it all ends well, this part stuck with my youngest.  I sense trouble the next time I attempt to clean out his closet by donating toys he has outgrown.  Thanks Disney.<br /><br />This movie attempts to cater to all age groups.  The parents will need a tissue as it pulls at the heartstrings.  From start, by showing a home movie of Andy when he was young and flashing to present day at a teenage Andy gets ready for college, to finish as the mom looks around Andy's empty room.  Her child is leaving home.  It speaks to tweens who want to leave childish things behind but still have great affection for childhood toys.  The appeal to young kids is as strong as ever as we follow the adventures of Woody and Buzz.  It did contain another creepy baby to give some nightmares.<br /><br />There were some mature references for a \\"G\\" rated movie.  Ken being gay was referenced several times and they had him striking sexy poses.  They had Buzz set to Spanish mode where he spoke Spanish for a minute or two.  The scene was funny to me but the subtitles annoyed my youngest as he couldn't keep up.<br /><br />This movie told a great tale of getting older for those kids who grew up with Woody and Buzz.  Both my boys could not stop talking about it afterwards.  I would skip the 3D version as nothing in the film warrants the use of 3D.iking sexy poses.

B00275EHJG|5.0|After so many years they've finally released the third and final Toy Story movie and like many others have said probably the best of the three and the most tear jerking emotional of them all.  AS you see that Andy has finally grown up and now starts his life going to college the toys wonder what's going to happen to them and as you see the situations and shenanigans they get into we make you laugh as you see the incredible CGI animation that is this movie,  but also they have a wonderful moral built into the movie as well that make it a wonderful movie for both kids and adults to watch.  All the characters and voice cast are back for this final movie which was great as they sometimes have to get new voices because of previous commitments that the actors and actresses have made with prior deals an the like but luckily this wasn't the case.  All I can say is if you've seen the other two movies this is a must see and while you get the laughter you'll also have some tear jerking scenes too though the ending while somewhat sad is also heart warming as you see what happens and the choice one former boy now a young man makes.  Also hopefully they end this trilogy here as they don't try and make it a cash cow like they've done with the Shrek franchise...
0307454541|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this with all the hoopla surrounding it and I was not disappointed at all. The characters were entertaining and were introduced well. It seems like many reviews talk about how slow it started but just like a TV series it takes some time to get them introduced correctly so you get a picture of their mindset and character before it takes off and this one certainly did!!! Be patient people!!! The story kept me guessing and threw some great surprises at me. The only confusing thing at times was keeping up with the names which were Swedish but they had a family tree that laid out the history that I referred to many times and helped greatly. I'm looking forward to the next two books and have already ordered them ( through Amazon of course! ). Larsson did a tremendous job keeping my interest and had me trying to solve the ending constantly in my off time from reading. I'm also curious about swedish coffee. It must be really good because the characters drink it day and night!!!!!!!!

1400052173|5.0|I told my mom, who worked for the health department in the 196s, about this book, and she remembered HeLa cells--she said she knew her as Helen Lang. Reading this book, I can almost guarantee you'll learn some things about the world you thought you knew.<br /><br />Maybe you thought that informed consent was age-old, but it turns out doctors were fighting against it less than fifty years ago. It puts something like abortion into perspective, knowing that in 1960, you really didn't have any right to decide or even know what happened to your own body in a hospital.<br /><br />Or maybe you thought there wasn't anyone left in the US living out their lives with no electricity or running water. Skloot introduces you to the Lackses, black and white, still living that far in the country, on the same land they've occupied since slave days.<br /><br />Finally, while the book doesn't get deeply technical, you see how medicine is in a state of constant revolution. Seeing where we were before HeLa cells came along is like looking back at the dark ages. If it weren't for Henrietta's unknowing contribution to medical science, pretty much every one of us would have fewer loved ones surrounding us today.<br /><br />Besides being immensely informative, this book is written beautifully. It never slips into the kind of bombastic grandstanding that often plagues journalistic books. At times I felt Skloot expected me to be more scandalized by the horror of primitive cancer treatments than I was (this book barely scratches the surface of cancer treatment horror). The writing is even-handed. Skloot shows what you had to face seeking medical help as a poor blck woman in the 50s. She also explains the ethical perils present for any patient back then, rich or poor. At the same time, she lets you know how much we all have to be thankful for, due to sacrifices unwillingly made. Skloot takes chances writing this story. It's risky for a white woman to try to explain the experience of a poor black family. And maybe her non-judgmental tone toward this family's history of rape and abuse is a little too PC... Did she get it right? I can't say, but all the people she met seemed real (neither all good nor all bad, just people), and I'm definitely a more educated person for having read this book.gmental tone toward this family's history of rape and abuse is a little too PC...

B0019N8P2W|5.0|The series came out more than 10 years ago.  I absolutely love it, but if you're browsing the amazon reviews at this point, you probably know all about it already.  This review is more focused on the DVD collection itself.  Which is pretty wonderful.  This is a DVD that falls more under \\"thoughtful, considerately supplied demand\\" rather than \\"revolting cash-grab.\\"  You get all 5 seasons of Daria, both movies, the never-before-seen (unless you have youtube, of course) pilot, and a few interviews with cast, directors, producers, etc., plus the \\"Daria Day\\" intros to all of the episodes played on Daria Day.  All for an extremely reasonable price.      The flaws, if you'd like to call them that, are few.    1) The most notable one, in my opinion, is that only the first episode of each disc begins with the \\"You're Standing On My Neck\\" intro.  Just two \\"la la LA la la's\\" and it begins.  Ideally suited if you're planning to marathon the whole series; less so if you only want to watch them once a day during dinnertime.  If you can't do without the song, though, you'll be hearing plenty of it, because  2) The music was replaced.  If you want to know why, read any other review on here.  The replacement music fills in the gaps perfectly.  During the first season there are a few gaps where the silence is pretty noticeable.  Then again, it was kind of like that, anyway. It took the producers a little while to find the right mix.  Nearly all of the credit-rolls (I've noticed that \\"Dye! My Darling\\" and \\"Daria!\\" have not) have been replaced by \\"You're Standing On My Neck\\" by Splendora.  Which makes its absence in the beginning in better perspective.  Cool song; didn't really want to hear it twice, anyway.  3) The credits now drag horizontal lines upward through the surreal credit photos.  Not very noticeable, though.  If you even catch it, I doubt it will bug you very much.    Other than that, perfect Daria.  This two-dimensional girl has some real depth, and I'm glad to finally have one of my favorite series in my video collection.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|The QUEEN: ROCK MONTREAL & LIVE AID BLU-RAY is a fantastic movie that captures the dynamic energy that was created when Queen played in concert. I've seen the Live Aid set from [[ASIN:B0002Z9HT8 Live Aid  (4 Disc Set)]] and that was one of those seminal \\"live\\" performances that go down in rock history (next to Santana and Sly & The Family Stone at Woodstock and Janis Joplin at Monterey), which is included on this set as well.<br /><br />Montreal's concert is just as great and this had much to do with the charismatic, flamboyant, and &uuml;ber talented front-man Freddie Mercury. Mercury sings, plays the guitar, piano, and microphone stand, and prances around the stage as he whips the crowd into a frenzy! He also goes through some minor costume changes, in true diva fashion, finally appearing in hot pants and bare feet. Gotta love Freddy!<br /><br />The picture quality is outstanding and the camera work is excellent. Even on the \\"Live Aid\\" set, the picture is pretty sharp though it still exhibits the phenomenon of \\"microphany\\"(a term used to describe horizontal banding stripes that occur in parts of the film on certain cameras that were close-up during the UK performances in Live Aid) but that doesn't interfere with viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Queen played tight on both concerts and Mercury was in fine voice belting out their hits and encouraging audience sing-a-longs.<br /><br />Here's a run down of the extras:<br /><br />* 25:11-minute -- LIVE AID SET --<br />includes performance of \\"Is This The World We Created\\" that was performed at night. i don't remember if this was included on the box set DVD of Live Aid, but it's a great performance as well.<br /><br />* 10:56-minute -- LIVE AID REHEARSAL<br />behind the scenes footage of Queen rehearsing and an interview. it's funny because the reporter states that Queen is known for their \\"fantastic live performances with light shows, fancy props and backdrops etc.,\\"  and wonders \\"since they won't be able to do that at 'Live Aid,' will they have the same impact/success?\\" well, Queen more than proved that they didn't need any accoutrements to blow the audience away.<br /><br />* 06:46-minute -- 1982 Interview from P.M. MAGAZINE<br />the picture quality is grainy and the volume is low, but it's cool to see this old show. this is basically a profile of the band and an intro to each member.<br /><br />The BLU-RAY also comes with a small booklet with color photos and credits.<br /><br />If you enjoy live rock concerts then this is definitely a must. You won't be disappointed and it's the next best thing to actually being there. I might also recommend [[ASIN:B001V9LRV0 Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition with Amazon Exclusive Bonus Disc)]] and the aforementioned [[ASIN:B0002Z9HT8 Live Aid  (4 Disc Set)]], which are not only great concert movies but also documentaries on the probably the two biggest concerts of the last century.l, Queen more than proved that they didn't need any accoutrements to blow the audience away.      * 06:46-minute -- 1982 Interview from P.M.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|It has it all! A wonderful message, beautiful drawing, magnetic characters and AMAZING music. I watched it with my daughter about 3 times in the first two days and I never do that! I can't believe it did not generate more buzz!
B000001ESP|5.0|\\"Moving Pictures,\\" Rush's eighth studio album, is without a doubt the band's most infamous and beloved, and not without good reason. Aside from birthing a solid set of radio classics that still live on today, it showed that the band wasn't all brains, and when appropriate, could rock with the best of them.<br /><br />From the opening synthesized notes of \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" it is evident that Rush were progressing, albeit in ways that perhaps no one could have anticipated. Carrying over the New Wave influence of \\"[[ASIN:B000001ESN Permanent Waves]],\\" Rush put a whole-hearted and concentrated effort on delivering a colorful set of songs that are as groundbreaking as they are accessible. The results are magical, to say the least. From the nostalgia of \\"Red Barchetta\\" --  an open road anthem of sorts -- to the introspective \\"Limelight\\" which documents lyricist/drummer Neil Peart's experience with fame, there isn't one moment where it feels as if the band is spinning their gears. \\"YYZ,\\" an instrumental where Geddy Lee's bass-lines merge with Peart's drumming so precisely to the point where you wonder if their brains were functioning as one for a moment in time, remains a highlight of the album, as well of the band's entire career, while the album closer, \\"Vital Signs,\\" flirts with reggae influences and works so well that it makes you wonder what other genres they could master.<br /><br />All of these moments combine to make an album that is dynamic and pulsing with life. Even today -- nearly thirty years later -- and after all the play it has received, it still manages to sound fresh and vital, which is a testament to the sheer talent and musicianship of the brilliant trio that make up Rush. Even if you've heard the songs a million times, it's hard to deny their power. Put simply, no rock collection is complete without this album, whether it be vinyl, CD or even mp3. Get it whatever way you can and prepare for an instant and everlasting fascination.
0812550706|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book. When I was in high school I was forced to read it as part of an English class. I had always disliked reading fiction. I had enjoyed reading nonfiction because it taught me something, though I never loved it.     When I started reading this book I fought my way through the first chapter, as I remember that piece being slightly slow and vague. But after that it was impossible to put down. This was the first time I had ever read ahead of the class, and I wasn't the only one. I remember being disappointed that I wasn't the first one to finish the book even though it wasn't due for another month. Something that never happens.    I can truly mark this point in my life as the time I fell in love with reading and learning. Suddenly, picking up a book wasn't a burden anymore.     If you enjoyed this book Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus by Orson Scott Card is also phenomenal. How he has written so much, all with such impressive detail is truly remarkable. Mr. Card, thank you for your writing.
B003HLM2QO|2.0|...if you knew up front that none of these songs were co-written by any guitarist, and that they were all written by Ozzy's producer and Ozzy himself, with a few credits to the keyboard player.  What is the point of having a great guitarist like Gus G in the band if you're not going to let him write?  Kevnin Churko has churned out some really boring, predictable modern rock chord progressions and been-there-heard-that syncopated, almost Nickelback-esque one note riffs.  Ozzy's solo legacy was forged on the combination of Ozzy writing with a kick-ass guitarist (and/or bassist at various times), and that has been totally ignored on this album (and to some degree on every Ozzy album starting with No More Tears, when producers started mucking with Oz's song-writing).  It's a real shame, because Oz still writes some good vocal melodies and sounds good in the studio (with some digital massaging, I'm sure), but this album just lacks the originality, intensity, and musicality that could have been created by a bunch of talented metal musicians.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a girl who no longer loves me, but as a series goes, it is an excellent production and should not be missed
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This cd is great.  Anybody who says they dont like eminems music really listen to his music in private and just doesnt tell anybody.  Embarassed that a white guy is the best rapper.  He even critiques his relapse album all through this cd and i really liked his relapse album.  Eminem nevere left.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Die-hard Eminem fans aren't going to like this, but despite anticipating this release for months, it was less than disappointing. If Relapse pushed fans to edge, Recovery was one giant leap back to safety. Its biggest downfall is the total absence of any risk. Lyrically, Recovery is far less offensive than Relapse. Musically, it hovers between safe and lame. If there was a genre to describe Recovery, it might be Easy Listening. To anyone hoping for a return to White America, Lose Yourself, or The Way I Am, save your money -- but at least you won't have to suffer through the accents from Relapse.    Between the excessive synth and vocal effects, Recovery at times feels more like an Akon cd than an Eminem album. A handful of tracks desire to be hits but can only hold on for about 40 seconds. Even guests Pink and Lil Wayne do little to help.    The best track hands-down was Love the Way You Lie, Feat. Rihanna. Imagine the already released Not Afraid but with Rihanna singing and a little more heat. It redeemed the whole album several times over. It may not be the first time Eminem's best track opened with a female singer, and for that he did well. But what does it say if the best track on an Eminem album is a song?    The runner up would have to be W.T.P. It was the first time he got a catchy groove going and finally started to flow. It may not quite be an anthem, and it may not top the playlist, but it's the closest he gets.    If you're a die-hard fan, buy the album, cause you're going to love it, regardless. For anyone else, check out Not Afraid, Love the Way You Lie, and W.T.P. They'll leave you wanting more, so follow up with 25 to Life, So Bad, Almost Famous, and Untitled. Be warned: some of the other tracks may leave you wishing you hadn't.    Net Rating: 8 out of 10.    [...]

Very touching and you can feel the love and respect that permeate their relationship. I wish he had written more and wish also I could get hold of his other book. If you love Freddie, you don't want to miss this and if you don't yet, it's time you get to know him more.
B0035RONVW|5.0|WOW, what a knockout. Their name kept popping up when I was reading Porcupine Tree reviews, and I took the plunge - and got 'em all in a matter of weeks, awesome stuff. Think of Dream Theater MINUS the pretension and insincerity. This is the best album but the rest all shine. No losers in this band's discography.
1878424505|2.0|The four pieces of advice that he gives are quite good. But, my goodness why all the mysticism? It's like buying a pizza and being told that you have received something incredibly important. Instead of a plain ole pizza, it's actually an \\"Alien space orb brought forth to nourish your body with truth and hope\\". But I guess that some people think that simple elegant ideas are 'deeper' if they are presented in a complex way.....

0061649694|5.0|I saw the movie.  I read the book.  Skip the movie.    The book is deliciously fun to read.  Gaiman can pack more info in a sentence than most writers can pack into a chapter.  The best thing about this book was though it was a \\"kids\\" book, the danger and the threats were very real: you got a sense that maybe the main character was in over her head, and maybe she wouldn't come out of it.  This was very much darker than other YA/kids books like [[ASIN:1416947205 Fablehaven]] or [[ASIN:B003K16OMY Billy: Messenger of Powers]], but it was a great read.  Lots and lots of fun... just be sure to read with the lights on.
006123141X|4.0|Conspiracies abound and the Sigma team has only a limited amount of time to stop a worldwide catastrophe from occurring. The Guild has a diabolical plan and the only clues Sigma has are a series of victims all marked with a pagan symbol. What is the connection between the destruction of a refugee camp, the death of a priest, and a book called the Doomsday Book?<br /><br />James Rollins excels at weaving together fact and fiction to produce high energy thrillers. THE DOOMSDAY KEY is no exception! The pace never relents as the members of the Sigma Force are in a race against time where enemies can just as easily turn into allies, and vice versa. The stakes are never higher as James Rollins ramps up the tension with each new revelation.<br /><br />THE DOOMSDAY KEY is the sixth book in the Sigma Force series and can be read as a stand alone. James Rollins does an excellent job at introducing the characters (and there are quite a few of them, as one might expect) and showing their past histories and relationships with one another. I suspect, however, that a reader already immersed in the series would appreciate some of the nuances of the tale a tad more than someone new to the series, if only because of the conflicted relationships with characters like Seichan.<br /><br />THE DOOMSDAY KEY is a dramatic adventure tale, blending together conspiracy theories from the past and present to create a horrifying scenario. James Rollins is absolutely brilliant at taking seemingly unbelievable situations and theories and making them seem plausible. The plot is stunning in its diabolical audacity but impossible to put down. Superb!!<br /><br />COURTESY OF BOOK ILLUMINATIONS
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. I'm so happy Eminem came back full strength. This is the Eminem I know and love. Every track is great!! Every Eminem fan needs to get this. I Promise you won't be disappointed.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|If hip-hop is dying, than Eminem is the adrenaline shot that is keeping the heart beating. Eminem's \\"Recovery\\" is just what hip-hop needs, as this is by far one if not his finest works lyrical on an album. Just a year past after his last release: \\"Relapse\\". Eminem is back and his new album Recovery states that. I have not heard his flow so crisp and so tight since \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", and for you voice pickers out, yes Eminem is back to his normal voice for most of the Album. On \\"Recovery\\", Eminem is showing the maturity in his lyrics, but still maintains the purity which in why I love Eminem. He has adapted to the changing trends in hip-hop but still maintains what keeps him apart for other rappers. For example this album appears to have a few more guest artists than pervious one and there is some auto tune T- Pain hooks. Nether one of these things are bad, as he still has that psychedelic flow that he is know for. This is pure Eminem as he is still rapping about, killing, doing drugs, having sex, being the best, and etc. I, who enjoyed last year's album \\"Relapse\\" was very surprise and please to see him go back to a lyrical assault. I was also surprise how Eminem was disappointed by his last album \\"Recovery\\". That is one of the reasons why I love Eminem. He sets the bar so high for himself that he diss last year album \\"Relapse\\" in tracks on \\"Recovery\\".<br />I was afraid I was going to be disappointed as I felt his debut single \\"Not Afraid\\" was good but not great. Oh I was wrong!! From listing to the first track \\"Cold Wind Blows\\" to the last one \\"Here We Go\\" I was left satisfy and empress. The 5 songs you must listen to are, Cinderella Man, Here We Go, No Love, and So Bad.<br /><br />If you love Eminem get this, if you hate Eminem get this. Regardless; I promise you won't be disappointed.<br />Oh a message for Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def push your album's to next year as Eminem's \\"Recovery\\" is going to rap album of the year. Yes it is that good!!
B002ZG997M|4.0|Eli (Washington) is a man on a mission in a post apocalyptic world. He is led by a voice that told him to find the last copy of the Bible and to bring it West. Along this treacherous path he encounters hijackers, cannibals and a Warlord named Carnegie (Oldman). The book, Carnegie believes is a weapon that strikes at the heart of man. It will give him the words he needs to control them and expand his power. Eli will stop at nothing to protect the book and bring it to where man still has hope! The forces of good and evil clash again over the oldest story ever told.<br /><br />The story is effective and the acting is great. Washington is so believable in his roles, which is only further complimented by Oldman. Suprisingly Kunis does a good job as Solara! The story is fluid and poignant. I was interested from start to finish. I strongly recommend a viewing.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A strong transfer, although the colors are muted intentionally to advance the feel of a post apocalyse world. A strong audio mix really let's out the BOOM! SPECIAL FEATURES: An excellent array of extras here that provide insight to the storyline and making of. FINAL VERDICT: WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This DVD came in the time frame the seller said it would and I had two different DVDs, they both arrived in the same package, I was a bit surprised, because I thought it was going to take longer. They were both new and in great condition.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|The review title says it all \\"Can't be Tamed\\" is/feels like a two sided Blade and that in more than just one way.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is what Miley's fan's and supporters from all over the world have been waiting for since like forever, (at least it kinda feels that way) her next Studio-Album and by today it is finally here - so much for the bright part.<br /><br />Second, since Miley herself has announced to put her music-career on hiatus for a while to focus more on acting and other future projects, \\"Can't be Tamed\\" also takes the rather unpleasant role of being a sort of \\"Good-Bye\\" Piece - so as much as Miley's followers looked forward to this Studio-release, im sure they will also shed many tears over it at the same time, since this will be her last music-related thing for maybe more than two years - who knows...<br /><br />However, Miley itself made sure, that \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" is more than just a decent \\"Good-Bye\\" to her fans. This Album covers both sides of her nature - the harder and the softer. Edgy Up-Beat-Pop meets Heart-touching voice-intesive Ballads - this is pretty much how you could describe \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" in a few words and this mix goes really well.<br /><br />It is different from Miley's previously released material, but it is still 100% Miley and im sure not only her true fans will feel/hear that while listening to this record. You can really feel the enormous effort that Miley put into the whole thing while making it. So it is not only her \\"last\\" Album, but a piece of herself too.<br /><br />My Personal Album Highlights:<br /><br />\\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" and \\"My Heart Beats For Love\\" (which is imho the BEST SONG she has ever written)<br /><br />The full length Concert DVD, filmed at the O2 Arena in London, is also a big patch for those who struggle with the fact to let Miley go from the music business (at least for some time) and it will surely help many through the hard time of Miley's stage absence as long as it lasts.
0143038583|5.0|A True Work of Genius !!!<br /><br />I read every word of this great book - and it is great. It truly deserves every last one of those five stars I gave it. It reads more like a novel than like a book of commentary about the state of our food supply. I even read all of the SOURCES pages as well as the INDEX. It's a masterpiece of English literature and more than simply a serious sociological book of non-fiction. It is a work of art!<br /><br />I used to own a natural food store in Lowell, Massachusetts - AEOLIA: WHOLE FOODS. This was before THE \\"Whole Foods\\" got so big and famous and started buying up all of the other natural food store chains like Bread & Circus, Fresh Fields, Mrs. Gooches, and the smaller strip mall regional chain stores. This was during the days when there were still Health Food Cooperatives (\\"Co-Ops!\\") and little health food stores in small towns and cities across the country - BEFORE Trader Joe's got as big as it has. This was in the late 1980's and early 1990's when it was only the natural food stores in England and Europe that went by the name of `whole food' stores and when natural food stores in the USA were still called `health food stores.\\" ... Those were the good old days.<br /><br />I'll never forget the day in May of 1987 - before I opened AEOLIA in 1989 - but right after I left my job as the manager for four years of the health food store in Groton, MA called `The Natural Shop' (before it moved into the funky old US Post Office in the center of town!) when I drove out to Bread & Circus in Hadley, Massachusetts for a job interview and the manager totally blew me off. They had lost my resume, and the girl at the information desk asked me to wait for someone from the meat department to come out and interview me. I was already thinking like this was a bad decision on my part, but after I saw this big blonde-haired guy that looked like a Nazi with a crew cut wearing a white smock with blood all over it coming my way like a lumberjack on steroids I knew I was in for a shocker. He took one look at me, and before he even looked at my resume (I brought along extra copies.) he said, \\"Listen, if you're serious about working here, you need to go back home and get a hair cut and trim your beard; and if you shave off that beard, don't expect to be able to grow it back. ... Have I made myself clear? ... Come back when you look like a real store employee.\\" ... He didn't even look at my resume! I felt like calling up Tony Harnett (the owner of Bread & Circus at the time) right then and there and complaining to him that his butchers in the meat department were not the most professional human resource / personnel dept employees to be managing people or interviewing prospective employees. Besides, what the hell did a former truck driver for Erewhon Natural Foods and an immigrant from Ireland only recently introduced to the world of alternative medicine, natural healing, and health food know about nutrition in general or homeopathic medicine in particular? It's ironic that he now owns Harnett's Apocathery in Cambridge, MA. (Hey, the money is in the pills and potions, not wheat germ and yogurt!) ... So, like Jesus, I `dusted the dust off my feet' and ended up painting houses all summer out in western Massachusetts before opening up my own, real, health food store back in my home town where I was the owner and the manager and there would be no one telling me when to get a haircut! Thank you very much!<br /><br />I relate this story because this is just one of the things that came to mind on reading Michael Pollan's outstanding tome on the health of our food and the soil it is grown on in this country. He has done us all a huge service in the interest of exposing the ugly underbelly of the food industry which, for the most part, has also taken over the natural food industry, the health food stores, and the organic food market. The last bastion of \\"hippiedom\\" left now it seems, when it comes to natural foods, is the realm of the biodynamic, permaculture-composting, local food-growing, truly organic garderners and farmers of non-genetically modified whole foods that can be bought at the source. Do you know any small, family farm, good local farmers to patronize who grow good food without petrochemical fertilizers or pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides who do not buy their seeds from Monsanto, who rotate their crops, rotate their fields, and use human and animal labor the good old way to grow their food? If you do, consider yourself truly blessed! And hey (I'll start this sentence with the word AND, even if it is not grammatically correct!) - how in the HELL can Whole Foods sell SEEDLESS watermelons and call that a WHOLE food? Are SEEDLESS watermelons natural? They may be \\"organic\\" by the latest USDA definition of corporately-defined, politically correct terminology, but they are in NO WAY totally natural, and if they lack the damn seeds, then they cannot be called a `whole' food and should not be sold at WHOLE FOODS. ... Correct? ... Besides, have you ever noticed that seedless watermelons do not taste as sweet as good old regular watermelons with seeds? I think Monsanto doesn't want us to be saving the natural seeds, that's what I think! ... Michael Pollan alludes to all of these sentiments in this wonderful book.<br /><br />I took notes, literally, from every page. I took over 252 notes in total. There is so much good information in this book, I don't know where to begin. It's like reading Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis. Every damn page has something profound written on it! If I still had my health food store (where I sold lots of books!) this book would have been featured, face-front (Yeah, I worked at Barnes & Noble for four years as well, and learned all the promotional and marketing tricks!), right on the eye level shelf of my book section book case! Also, I would have had copies for sale right on the front counter by the register as well, because this book lays it all out there on the line. Hell, it even talks about magic mushrooms at the end of the book (my favorite chapter)! When you can read a book that discusses both the evils of Monsanto and the beauty of the Eleusinian Mystery Rights of ancient Greece in the same pages, then that is my kind of book.<br /><br />I could not resist quoting these words from page 132:<br /><br />\\"We never called ourselves organic - we call ourselves `beyond organic.' Why dumb down to a lesser level than we are? If I said I was organic, people would fuss at me for getting feed corn from a neighbor who might be using atrazine.Well, I would much rather use my money to keep my neighborhood productive and healthy than export my dollars five hundred miles away to get `pure product' that's really coated in diesel fuel. There are a whole lot more variables in making the right decision than does the chicken feed have chemicals or not. Like what sort of habitat is going to allow that chicken to express its physiological distinctiveness? A ten-thousand-bird shed that stinks to high heaven or a new paddock of fresh green grass every day? Now which chicken shall we call `organic?' I'm afraid you'll have to ask the government because now they own the word.<br /><br />\\"Me and the folks who buy my food are like the Indians - we just want to opt out. That's all the Indians ever wanted - to keep their teepees, to give their kids herbs instead of patent medicines and leeches. They didn't care if there was a Washington, D.C., or a Custer or a USDA; just leave us alone. But the western mind can't bear an opt-out option. We're going to have to refight the Battle of the Little Bighorn to preserve the right to opt out, or your grandchildren and mine will have no choice but to eat amalgamated, irradiated, genetically prostituted, barcoded, adulterated fecal spam from the centralized processing conglomerate.\\"<br /><br />Whew...\\" ...<br /><br />That's the author, Michael Pollan, quoting his natural food and lifestyle mentor, Joel Salatin of Polyface Farm in Swoope, Virginia outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. I have been to Charlottesville, Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain and Shenadoah River Valley area - home of Thomas Jefferson, his Monticello, his University of Virginia, The Dave Matthews Band, and `And George!\\" in Albemarle County. ... It's the kind of rural place out in the green rolling hills of the countryside where I can seer the human race getting back on the right track again. ... `Whew' - Indeed! ...

B003RNXIBK|5.0|This is the first Eminem album I've been interested in buying since the \\"Encore\\" album. I'm definitely glad I picked this one up. Wow, I'm thoroughly impressed with this album. Eminem's lyrical abilities shine for the duration of the album. The way he puts words together in his rhymes is hard to beat with the MCs out there right now.<br /><br />This album has a good mix of fast-paced and mellow beats. I'm still trying to find my favorites out of the track list, but these jumped out immediately as 5-star tracks for me:<br /><br />3) On Fire<br />5) W.T.P.<br />6) Going Through Changes<br />7) Not Afraid<br />10) Space Bound<br />12) 25 To Life<br />14) Almost Famous<br />15) Love The Way You Lie<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this one as much as I have! Love it!

B0027BOL4G|5.0|If you shop at ORGANIC food chains for your groceries, such as WHOLE FOODS MARKET, YOU ARE COOL. For the rest, you NEED to see this movie, IF YOU CARE about what you eat. The truth of the matter is that AMERICAN FOOD IS KILLING US!
B00026ZG10|5.0|I've always loved this movie.  I had it on tape but wanted it on DVD.  I found it new for a good price through Amazon.  I'm very pleased with this product.
0812548094|2.0|I liked the first book, but after getting 1/3 through this book i found i could not continue. The book was simply too vulgar. It started talking about 'getting your hand up girls skirts' and it simply turned me off. Not the kind of thing i want to read about in a book. I wish to read a good book, and save sex for the internet, not in my book.
B002VECMAO|1.0|this may well be the worst movie that i have EVER seen...!!!  it's sooo bad that i actually stopped watching it about 60% thru and the $1.99 rent i paid Amazon was $2.00 too much...!!!
0870703781|5.0|This is a very nice book and holds very close to the 1st addition. Picture and print reproduction quality is much better than the 1st with a few additional frames adding to the original. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and can say that I will keep an eye out for more great deals with Amazon the world leader in book selections.<br /><br />V/R<br /><br />PhotogDog
030726999X|5.0|The wait for the translation of the last of this trilogy was well worth it! I found I couldn't put the book down. It was wonderful to catch up with the familiar characters and be pulled back into the suspense and the rocket rides of action. I hated to see it end. The characters felt so real to me ...Although late at night in bed when I finished the The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest, my mind stayed in motion. Excellent!
B000001FSR|4.0|She likes it, and that's all that matters.  As an Artist, I can't stand his Music, but she likes Cat Scratching, Pan Banging, outhouse-Pig Calling Music, so I was happy to find, and send it to her house so she can listen all alone in Bliss to Tom Waits.  I also plan to send some of his other Albums to someone I don't like, but his wife does.(smile)  Again Amazon, you have come through for me..

1597801585|5.0|I purchased The Windup Girl at [...] as an epub download of this novel for my new HTC Droid Incredible and the eReader ap Aldiko, wondering how it would go on the small droid screen. It was great! The Windup Girl is so well written I became completely lost in the story forgetting I was even reading, let alone reading on a smart phone screen. The adventure moves like a great game of go, fortune reversing with each act of the wonderfully developed characters. Amazing he could develop such a nitty-gritty post-oil world in such fine detail and integrity. The windup girl herself is transcendent. Very reminiscent of Ian McDonald's River of Gods. I look forward to more from Paolo Bacigalupi. Thanks!
B000R7GKQE|4.0|The item came in excellent condition and I was very pleased with it. However, it was missing some content (like gag reels, interviews, etc) I do not believe this had anything to do with the person I ordered from.  It took a little longer to arrive than I anticipated, but the postal service isn't as fast these days! :)  I would definitely order from this supplier again.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|As another reviewer stated I also consider myself a Christmas Carol afficionado.  I read the book each season and watch every version I own, which is substantial.  I find it to be quite faithful to the book exept for the few instances he mentions.  Yet, the film does contain other minor details such as the fact that Scrooge was suffering a cold at the time.  However, they do not ruin the movie for me at all.  Can I do without them?  Yes, I can but they do not in any way detract from a wonderful movie that stays very close story-wise and dialogue-wise.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely gorgeous to view.  I can not wait to get this on Blu-Ray.  It completely captured the feel of an 1800's England Christmas.  I found the ghosts to all be unsettling and as my wife said \\"That was actually scary!\\"  It may not be for kids to be honest.  And I think that was the point - this wasn't originally written for children, it is a Christmas ghost story which was a very popular thing to do at the holiday times then.  The ghosts weren't there to be nice and helpful, they were in Scrooge's life to matter-of-factly show him how he screwed up.  I never got the feeling in any CC media that the ghosts truly cared for Scrooge's well-being.<br /><br />Anyways, this is now an annual staple for my holiday traditions.  P.S., I never really cared for Jim Carrey either.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Buy this!!!  I am the type of person who usually clings to artist's older albums.  But with Eminem, I feel differently.  This album has shown that he can change with time.  This album is deep and very emotional.  His flow and lyrics are amazing.  That was an obvious given.  As much as I love his earlier LPs, this has be be right up there.  It is definitely different, but very catchy!!!  If you have the leaked version and like the music, please support by buying this awesome quality album.  I have one and plan on buying even more!!!  RECOVERY indeed!!!
0312370830|5.0|Great Story! I love story lines that involve history.  This writer brings you back to a troubling time in France's history,which I had no knowledge of before reading this book. I also liked the way each chapter flowed form the past to the present.  Good book for a Summer read. Enjoy!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|If you felt \\"Black Rain\\" was a little lacking song wise, then this opus blows away any doubt, a massive return to form, first suggested in \\"Down To Earth\\" but now fully realized.<br /><br />This is perhaps the most melodic offerings from Ozzy since \\"Bark At the Moon\\" and \\"The Ultimate Sin\\". There is something for everyone here and no one should feel out in the cold.There is also a definate turn away from the downtuned guitar style of Zakk Wylde and towards a more classical metal guitar style from new guy Gus G. I also hear less pro-tools on the vocals this round; and honestly when purely represented Ozzy's vocals sound great.<br /><br />Early favourite would have to be \\"Soul Sucker\\" with it's monstorous riff and thumping bass, caught myself singing it as I walked the dog tonight with the ipod on, hope no one heard. Most would have heard the single \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\" which should go barnstormers in a live setting, opener \\"Let It Die\\" with its voodoo-esque feel spirals off an opening guitar break and you know you are in for a real treat, \\"Life Wont Wait\\" is close to a ballad but has a nice Beatle-esque flavour, one of Ozzy's tales of living life without regret. \\"Diggin Me Down\\" reminds me of early Cooper of all things in the intro, before it distorts into a huge Sabbath riff, lyrically asking the question of how bad things must get before the second coming of the saviour. Great stuff. \\"Time\\" is an oddity, not in a bad way with it's plucked strings and almost \\"Oasis\\" feel.  \\"I Want It Now\\" swirls out of the speakers with an almost thrash metal feel, then delivers some very Cradle of Filth-like synth and piano moments,not theft 'cause after all Ozzy is the grandfather of all this stuff. I can even forgive the \\"I Love You All\\" epitaph, cornball for sure but sincere.<br /><br />You know when you are going to love an album and it's going to have staying power. We'll this is such a beast, big songs, catchy as all hell, chest thumping glorious old school metal. Love him or loathe him Ozzy has hit a home run.as hit a home run.

0385504225|1.0|Other reviewers have done a brilliant job of pointing out Brown's ponderous prose, cliched anger-inducing plot twists that go nowhere and add no suspense, etc. etc.  I can't normally sleep on a plane, but during 11 hours of listening to this drivel on flights to Europe I dozed several times (and didn't miss anything, it appears).    Although I don't want to waste another minute on this. there's one element that will haunt me for a few more seconds.  A brilliant scientist has her lab tucked away at the far corner of a really big, really dark, really scary pod.  Every time she goes in it freaks her out.  To solve the problem of crossing this void in the dark (did I mention it's really big, really dark, and really scary?) she lays a carpet runner so her toes can be happy and helpful.  Sale at Home Depot?  Now I have an electrical device (several actually) that has an activation pad which results in a brilliant beam of illumination coming out one end.  It's really amazing.  In fact, even my iPhone has a flashlight app, or just the glowing screen works really well.  Apparently it was fine to carry cell phones bouncing signals all over the place into this electrically isolated environment.  Just a thought, and my last on this except to say thanks to the other reviewers for reassuring me that I didn't miss anything.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I was shopping around for a game headset as I have a little one and a wife who likes to go to bed well before I do / nap on the couch occasionally.  As any gamer knows, the audio is half the experience, especially when you need to hear if someone is sneaking up behind you.    I shopped around for a bit, debating heavily between this headset and the Tritton AX Pro.  A friend of mine has the Trittons and said that I would be a fool to buy the x41s as they get hit with tons of interference and static/popping.  I couldn't really imagine being tethered to my console with a bunch of wires, and I read some other reviews online with viewpoints contrary to his, so I decided to give the x41s a shot.    Before I did, I contacted Amazon's returns department to ensure that I would have no problems returning the headset if they did not perform satisfactorily.  I was assured it would not be a problem, so I ordered them that day.    I am glad I did!  This headset is fantastic.  For brevity's sake here are the pros and cons.    Pros:  -Lightweight - I usually don't even realize I have them on    -Great sound - I was instantly impressed by the quality of the audio as well as how much I could actually hear.  There are sounds in Modern Warfare 2 that I didn't even realize were in the game.  In complete silence you hear the creaking of metal, background noises, etc.  In the heat of battle, you can hear people sneaking up on you.  Anyone I have let try the headset on, gamers and otherwise, simply say \\"Wow\\"    -Hardly any interference at all - I live in an area saturated with WiFi routers.  I can see about 10 routers from my house if I perform a wireless survey.  I also have a wireless game adapter running on the same 2.4 GHz band literally one foot from the x41 transmitter.  I rarely get interference, and if I do it lasts just a second.  The x41s frequency hop (like your old cordless phone) to ensure interference-free communications    -Absolutely silent gaming - Like I mentioned, my wife likes to nap on the couch on occasion.  Typically, I would go find something else to do, or game in almost complete silence.  Now, I just put on my headset, and off I go.    Cons:  -Even though the headset is lightweight, I do get some pain in my ears when wearing my glasses.  I only put them on late at night, but it hurts when I take the headset off.  It's a trade-off I am willing to make.    -The optical cable that comes with the unit seems pretty thin and cheap.  I would pick up a new one from one of Amazon's vendors - you can probably find a good quality cable for about $3-5    -The microphone monitoring is a bit weak.  Even with the chat volume cranked, I can hardly hear myself when talking to others in my party.  It's partly because the boom is not quite long enough to reach directly in front of my mouth, but nonetheless I find myself asking party members if they can hear me, because I can barely hear myself.  The one positive is that they always respond that they can hear me loud and clear.      In the end, I am extremely happy I purchased this headset, I would recommend it to anyone.    A final note:    Many people complain that there is a ton of interference and popping with this headset.  This is likely related to one of two things.    1) A WiFi radio way too close to the headset.  If I happen to have my notebook pc right in my lap downloading a large file I will get interference.  That is to be expected with two WiFi radios so close together, so you can't really count that.    2) Batteries.  People often let the batteries run out completely before changing.  I have done it once and started to receive interference for the last 10 minutes the headset ran before turning off completely.  As long as you replace your batteries as they run out, you will barely get any interference.  I recommend buying a set of 4 rechargeable AAA batteries so you always have some on hand for a quick swap.
B00006FDCD|4.0|It (1990) is a made-for-TV movie based on Stephen King's novel.  It stars Tim Curry, Harry Anderson, Richard Thomas, John Ritter, Richard Masur, Annette O'Toole, Tim Reid, and Dennis Christopher.  Basically the movie is about an evil force that takes the form of an evil clown and terrorizes a small town in New England.  This clown had terrorized a group of kids thirty years earlier, but now he's back to terrorize once more.  This group of kids, now adults, reunite to battle the clown (It) once more.<br /><br />There are more than 420 Amazon reviews so far, so I just want to say what I liked and didn't like.<br /><br />Tim Curry plays Pennywise the Dancing Clown.  His performance is brilliant.  His voice and mannerisms are perfectly matched to his physical appearance.  He's quite a scary clown.  In my opinion, Pennywise doesn't get enough screen time in this movie.  He's actually a little bit underexposed.  The length of the movie?  It's over three hours long because it was made for TV.  This is mostly a negative, in my opinion.  A little too long to sit through in one sitting, though never boring.  The acting?  Overall it is good, for the most part.  How scary is this movie?  On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the scariest, I'd give it a 3.  Clowns are scary to a lot of people.  If you're one of those people who is terrified of clowns, especially evil clowns, then this movie is for you because you'll be scared no matter what.<br /><br />The ending of the movie?  It's a little bit strange, to say the least.<br /><br />Overall, a very solid horror movie that I definitely recommend.
B002RSDW80|4.0|A pleasant, light-hearted film about a young woman who finds meaning in her life by trying the recipes in Julia Child's classic guide to French cooking (talk about existentialism).  The story alternates between Julie's life: answering phones in a cube farm, dealing with her husband, learning about the more abstruse aspects of French cuisine, and blogging about the whole experience; and Julia Child's life: living in France, studying at the legendary Beaucuse D'or, writing her book, and getting it published.  So ultimately, it's the story of two books and the women who wrote them, and to be fair, the supportive husbands who made their journeys possible.  Streep really is amazing as the legendary Julia Child, whose dynamic personality dominates every scene she's in.  Overall, this film suffers from being a trifle light, and there certainly aren't a lot of belly laughs, either, but it's still a sweet, delectable entertainment.

As an Iyengar Yoga student and Teacher in Training, and as a pregnant yogi, this book is my bible of how to take care of myself & baby, so I can continue practicing and teaching yoga safely. If you are new to yoga or practice at other yoga schools, do seek advice of Iyengar senior teachers, since yoga for pregnancy is quite different to normal practice and the differences should be taken seriously.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of Em, but this album is straight up rap greatness.
B003CIG7AE|2.0|Ive been waiting for this album for almost 3 years now. Expecting to find an album that was kind of a mix of the grandiose arrangements of there first album and the simplicity of the second album. Instead I get what really seems to be a throw away album with throw away tracks. Not one track really rocks at all, nothing on this really gets you moving or wanting to move at least. The album just kinda meanders from song to song. By all accounts this is a soft rock album and quite a step down from cease to begin, witch wasnt that amazing to begin with. Dont get me wrong I love band of horses, but i find more and more that there a song band, and not an album band.
0345479092|5.0|A great resource to have on hand!  It helped me survive the first few weeks with my newborn!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of MM. However; his first to albums were great, lyrical,deep,poignant, and every thing since then has felt forced and honestly its just my opinion but he fell on the back burnner. If you were a fan of his first 2 albums and even his first tape from way back in the early 90's then this is the album for you. He raps with that rare passion that made him famous in the first place. If you are more into his commercial pop sound then the only song on this track that you will prob like is the last 1. Overall I give this a 10/10.. listen to the raw emotion and angst that come from Marshall.. simply put get it...
B002VECM6S|5.0|I'm a big football fan, so I already knew who Michael Oard was.  But I didn't know the story behind the player.

0785134352|5.0|People like to say Kick-Ass was shocking in terms of comic violence. Generally, however, anyone who's opened a Marvel comic before will already be conditioned to anything you could find in KA, especially if that person is a Punisher or Marvel Zombies fan. But it is violent and profane. Make no mistake.   Kick-Ass is very well-drawn and well written with a fun, theatrical-type story and several twists to keep it going from cover to cover. The characters are likeable (especially Dave, who us comic nerds can empathize with) and while the story isn't realistic (Hit Girl tearing people apart with samurai swords), who cares?   Kick-Ass is EVERYTHING that a drawn piece of art should be. Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Kick-Ass.   Can't wait for number 2..      One more thing about KA. It is PACKED with pop culture references. Other comics, music, a movie or two.. if you get the references, you'll probably grin ear to ear the whole time like I did.
B000001GQD|5.0|Aaaaaah, Maestro Richter, the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and Rachmaninov's Concerto #2! This is basically *the* quintessential recording of Rachmaninov's Concerto #2!     I have listened to the cassette version of this recording so many times, I have broken it multiple times beyond repair... I have bought two copies of this CD and it sounds as great as always.     As an amateurish concert pianist, I would easily trade a good ten years of my life for the opportunity to perform this piano-concerto with a professional Orchestra... It would be a privilege and a great honor that I would cherish for the rest of my life!     This recording is legendary, I would give anything to have been in Maestro Richter's place and made history!     Warm Regards Always,   Charles Henri Darakdjian

055380684X|2.0|I found this book interesting only through the first few chapters.      The information on myelin and how we learn make a lot of sense.  Coyle's first few chapters were written with this deep practice method in mind - short stories and good examples breaking down how the process works. Thus, I understood it better.      Then, the book veers to tangentially-related tales about hotbeds of success -such as with the KIPP educators, who must have granted the author more access than the other hotbeds because it carried on and on.     Admittedly I had to skim ahead.  My eyes perked up later when I saw the chapter on Jamarcus Russell and his trainer. It is unfortunate that he was chosen as an example, considering he is one of the biggest NFL draft busts. The much-told Kurt Warner saga exemplifies deep practice (he learned from the compressed Arena League action, and failures) than Russell the underachiever.    Fortunately the Jamarcus Russell story is late in the book - and many readers will have bailed by then.      The book is OK at best and rates much lower than the excellent \\"Lance Armstrong's War\\".  It is too bad the book does not practice what it preaches.
0385341008|5.0|I recently read this book for a book club and could not put it down!  The entire book club loved it and it opened up some great discussion.  It is written in letter format so it is a very quick read.  It is also very historically accurate which just made it that much more delightful.  I recommend this book to everyone I know.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I re-watched this movie to get ready for the remake. I bet every kid in the 80's grew up with this film. Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso, who is forced to move to Reseda. He meets Ali Mills, and makes an enemy with her ex-boyfriend, Johnny. When Daniel is violently bullied, the handyman named Mr. Miyagi agrees to teach him how to defend himself in the art of karate. At first, Daniel thinks he's being treated like a slave, because he has to wax the cars, paint his house but he was really learning karate moves the whole time. Mr. Miyagi gets Daniel ready for an 'All Valley Karate Tournament' where he must confront his enemies, and Johnny and see if he has what it takes to be the best and win the gold. I highly recommend THE KARATE KID!!!
0316017922|5.0|In the Opilogue to \\"the outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all\\" (285) Malcolm Gladwell contradicts an ordinary outliers. At the same time that he argues no one is outlier at all. Gladwell also implies that we can change anyone, without having family and parents' background, being success, for instance, the KIPP academy in New York City can help a lot of low income families' children to success. Those no background children are predicted losers in the past, however, KIPP \\"[takes] the idea of cultural legacies seriously\\" and \\"bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city.\\" In other words, KIPP let student have a chance to obtain or inherit a strength part of a wet-rice farmer's cultural legacy. On the one hand, students are given chances to do enough school work as similar to 10,000-hour rule. On the other hand, success depending on one has a chance to practice enough to get fluent skill to do work. Therefore, \\"success is not exceptional or mysterious.\\"(285) From this perspective, the hidden benefits of birthdates, family and parents backgrounds, extraordinary opportunities and the cultural legacies, those are factors contribute one be success. According to this view, the successful people, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, math whizzes or superstar lawyers, have deserved \\"a web of advantages and inheritances but others haven't got that luck. In sum, then, his Gladwell's view is that the outlier is depending on with or with opportunities to do 10,000-hour work as being success. Everyone can be success if one has opportunities. Basically, everyone is equal and no outlier or success.   I have mixed feelings. In my view, success does not only depend on the opportunities, we still need to have courage to take the opportunities and overcome other obstacles such as hardship work. That is relating in a personal characteristics and whether one finds its bliss and work on its bliss or not. In addition, many Americans assume that success determines how much one canmake. Some might object, of course, on the grounds that wealth is success. Yet I would argue that many students confuse their goals because the career's income index shows which career can make more income. Moreover, parents will influent their children choose their majors. If one can't find its goal or bliss, I don't think that one can put more effort on its work and to success. Overall, then, I believe, finding bliss - an important point to make success.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Usually trendy critics talk up American cable TV these days and constantly claim we're in a golden age of television.  I would have to disagree on that.  Most shows have some interesting plot devices, but overally are just light and quirky, occasionally dark, but hardly the deep, penetrating dramas that they purport to be.<br /><br />Not Breaking Bad.<br /><br />This is a really electric, intense show, with a fascinating premise and a great, brilliant lead performance by Bryan Cranston.  The story is about a chemsitry teacher turned meth dealer because he wants to make a lot of cash quickly.  He's dying of cancer.  Many critics have said he does this because he wants money for his family, but I don't think that's the case.  Mr. White (Bryan's character) has been a milquetoast his whole life, seeing friends and relatives of his earn mega bucks while he struggles as a high school chemistry teacher (and working part time at a car wash to make ends meet).  After his diagnosis, he \\"breaks bad\\" and doesn't want to be a good boy anymore.  While he cares about the family, there's more to his madness than just \\"helping support his family\\".  He goes to the other side, and he can't return.  There are some really astounding scenes in this season, like when White strangles a meth dealer in a basement, and a confrontation with another meth dealer named Tuco, who has screwed over his partner and his former student (well played by Aaron Paul, who is just as good as Bryan is).  Needless to say, White doesn't take it lying down.<br /><br />There are some overly coincidental happenings that occur too easily, and a gratuitous scene with a bathtub that is visceral but unnecessary, but the series (so far) has been intense and immensely watchable.  Do yourself a favor.  Watch this show.  It won't let you down.  It's as good as everyone says it is.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|I've been a fan of The Roots since their debut back early to mid nineties. I haven't been terribly impressed with entire albums for the last few albums they've had out.  This is turned out very well! I like the appearance of Blu on a few tracks. (Check out Blu & Exile's \\"Below the Heavens\\" album if you dig his style...cali spitter) The flow of this album goes together quite well and I didn't find myself looking for the next track half way through a tune. Granted I've only listened this new album once. I am willing to bet it will only get better from here on out. Check it out!!

Although the names and location has been changed, it still has the same basic plot, and few references to the original. Jaden Smith Stars as Dre Parker, a kid who is being forced to move to Beijing. When he develops a crush on Mei Ying, he makes an enemy with Cheng. After Dre is abused and humiliated, Mr. Han, the maintenance man of Dre's building decides to help him and teach him the art of kung fu, in order to protect himself.

0393072231|5.0|Great book. Lewis is a superb story teller and brings this particuar story to life in a most engaging and compelling manner. The only downer is that there's no happy ending here...Not Lewis' fault...rather, the fault of our broken system.  A worthwhile and enriching read.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|I've had this album on pre-order for a little over a month, all the while enjoying the various pre-release video clips and sneak releases.  And after finally downloading it today and listening to it twice without interruption, all I can say is it was well worth the wait.  Now, to be clear, I'm an avid (perhaps rabid) Ozzy fan and I go absolutely nuts over pretty much everything he does.  True, this album does not go off into uncharted territory for the Ozzman.  Nor does it surprise by recreating the genre he is credited with creating in the first place.  There's no War Pigs, no Crazy Train.  But what there is, is a really nicely produced, great sounding album, with a number of really good tracks.  Ozzy's vocals sound great, even when not altered electronically.  Bass and drum lines are solid, and the guitar is fantastic.  Some of the intros and interludes remind me of Randy Rhoads' classical guitar elements, which is a good thing.  Importantly, the lyrics are interesting.  Less corny than a number of recent albums, for the most part, and interesting to listen to.  I don't know many other guys that are creating anything this good musically that are in their 6th decade of making music.  Ozzy rock on!
B000B5OD4I|3.0|Purchased this watch and was satisfied with it until it began to stop after 3 days. Had to take it to a certified Seiko watch repair shop and was advised if I received a Seiko warranty card with the purchase.  Unfortunately, I did not and the repairman gave me some slack. It is an original watch but the packaging was not. Even the instructions were actually copies of the original. Good watch but make sure you get a Seiko lifetime warranty card.
B002ZG995E|5.0|Now you will have to watch the movie to find out what Alpha Mike Foxtrot is all about...but I can tell you that it is a fantastic action packed movie from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />Do not go to the theater expecting a re-make of the TV show...instead go there with an open mind and with the intent of being entertained with some comedic action.<br /><br />The cast, in my opinion, is dead on and makes every character portray the original cast from the TV show.  There are some great catch phrases in the movie that make it fun.  There is a lot of CGI in the movie but it is done quite well and makes the action sequences feel as if they were pretty darned close to real.<br /><br />I am not going to tell the story here..but spend the money to watch the movie and you will walk out liking/enjoying it.
1594488843|5.0|This is one of those books that describes something extremely obvious and intuitive that at the same time goes against what you were taught was \\"common sense.\\" This would be a good book just for the survey of the (long) history of the study of the theory of motivation. It also concludes with a number of things you can do to create an environment that encourages mastery (as opposed to simply meeting goals) in your work and school. As an agile software developer I had a few aha! moments when you understand how agile practices really encourage flow and create environments where teams and individuals can be highly productive. As a parent, this book re-enforced that the way children approach learning and problems is something to be viewed with awe.  It's a quick read that will get you thinking and learning, and a good companion to  [[ASIN:0932633366 Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations]] if you want a deeper study of the performance management aspects that Pink discusses, and [[ASIN:1934356050 Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware (Pragmatic Programmers)]] if you're a programmer looking for techniques to create a framework for working more effectively.
B00275EHJG|5.0|In 1995, a new 3D animation film company called Pixar caught our attention with their first feature length film ever, Toy Story. Four years later they entranced us again with the sequel to their first film, Toy Story 2. Now, 15 years and 11 films later, they brought imagination and genius to the cinema again with Toy Story 3. I can say, 11 years to wait for Toy Story 3 was absolutely worth it! This is such a fun movie for everyone, not just the kids! Here is a short storyline intro to Toy Story 3.    Andy (John Morris) is now 17, and going to college, and he hasn't played with his beloved toys for years. The toys are afraid they're going to be thrown away. And they nearly are, but instead they are donated to Sunnyside Day Care. At first it seems like a magical place, where the toys can be played with for generations. They meet some new toys, including Lotso, (voiced by Ned Beatty)  the old nice seeming bear who smells like strawberry's. And they also meet Ken, (Michael Keaton) a guy who lives in a dream home, has a room just to change outfits, and seems like a perfect fit for Barbie. (Jodi Benson) But then they realize it's not all fun and games when they're assigned to the toddler's play room, where the toys are immediately messed up. So they try to escape, and get back to Andy, who they realize still cares about them.    So there's the first say, 40ish minutes of the film. (There's an opening similar to the other films, where Andy is playing with the toys and it seems real.) While the story is somewhat predictable, it is also a tearjerker for some, and it is undoubtedly hilarious to all. Now, there are some parts that are a little intense, that you may have to reassure your children that Buzz (Tim Allen) and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the rest of the gang are okay. It is most definitely a kids movie, but it also seems like they tailored it to the now teenagers who grew up watching the first two.     This is a great film, and I seriously recommend it to all. It is definitely the best of the Toy Story films, and it is at least in the top 3 of Pixar films in my opinion.
1400052173|5.0|THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is the best non-fiction book I have read in memory. The author has done a wonderful job of research and arranging the text in an approachable, understandable fashion. Bringing to my mind questions regarding humanity (the humane treatment of people), the moral and ethical issues involved in biological research, and legal issues of individual rights, among others gives a great deal to ponder and do continued reading.    Henrietta's family was treated, unfortunately, in an all too familiar fashion for their heritage but Deborah's courage and devotion to her mother and sister along with the support of the author (Rebecca Skloot) allowed her, I believe, some measure of peace, albeit slight, in this life.      Students in the study of biology, ethics, and law will find much to \\"chew on\\" in this presentation. Five stars are not enough for this one.
B00314VYNE|3.0|I will admit I purchased this on a whim without examining the description too closely.  We have a ragdoll Woody that looks similar to this Jessie doll so I assumed they were constructed alike.  The ragdoll Woody is so cute and he looks and moves exactly like he does in the movie.  This Jessie doll is built on a Barbie doll body which leaves her looking and feeling a little stiff.  Her hat is basically useless since it does not stay on her head.  I do wish I had looked a little more closely and purchased the ragdoll Jessie instead but this one will have to do the trick since I've already ripped her from the package!
B0010DRYPU|1.0|Was this the only film made in 1992? Over-long, over-written, over-acted, and just plain over-wrought. \\"Did Pa used to kill folks?\\" Yes little one, everything except the green light on this over-blown horse opera.
0307454541|1.0|Please don't read this book.<br /><br />It's not for the plodding writing, which I attributed to shoddy translation.<br /><br />It's for the lurid, disgusting instances of violence, mostly against women.  It's worse than the sklooshy CSI images and stories of dead, raped women with bullet holes or other damage to their lifeless bodies.  It's just relentless misogyny.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype.  It's not good.
1932100660|5.0|I have read The China Study and have also heard several lectures by Dr. Campbell. There are over 700 research references, all of which were peer-reviewed by professionals and mostly published in the very best scientific journals.      When I see his integrity being questioned by a very small number of would-be authorities writing reviews on this site and elsewhere on the Internet, who fail to sign their real names or use initials (like the previous reviewer), who clearly have not read the book and who cite no professional references to justify their claims, suggests to me that they are nothing more than goons being paid off by a very powerful industry with a lot of their stuff to protect. If you read the book, you will understand my concern because Dr. Campbell spent about 20 years on expert panels that developed diet information for the public. He knows well the ill effects of corporate interests on public health. I say very small number of critics because of the 747 Amazon reviews, there are 15 best reviews (5 stars) for every worst review (1 star).         This behavior disturbs me greatly because I know so many people who's health has been greatly helped by reading the book or getting the same information from others. When they say that Dr. Campbell only has an agenda or is merely a vegan activist, I know what a lie this is. He tells in the book that he was raised on a dairy farm, until his research overwhelmingly persuaded him that whole food, plant based foods are the healthiest.      He even avoids using the 'vegan' word because, as he explains in his lectures that I have heard, most vegans are not practicing the book's message because of their excessive use of processed foods high in fat, sugar and salt.      Sometimes, I am convinced these goons are programmed to say the same things over and over again.      What other dietary lifestyle even comes close to being able to cure advanced heart disease for the vast majority of patients, get almost all diabeticsoff their meds, stop the progression of serious autoimmune diseases like MS, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and dramatically reverse experimental cancer with animal protein--all with the same dietary lifestyle?      The final test of the reliability of this book is simply to TRY IT AND YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|It's pretty amazing when you consider all of the major album releases and tours by todays hottest female pop stars (Lady Gaga, Madonna, Xtina, etc.) - how every one of them dabble in futuristic pop, and assisted songwriting from JR Rotem, Tricky Stewart, Red One and all the like.....<br /><br />So what does Cyndi Lauper do? She goes and records a full-on blues album with help from B.B. King, Charlie Musslewhite, and Johnny Lang, among others. Sometimes the legacy of an artist is the art itself, and not the image, or the celebrity, or the drama, or the gossip. Cyndi Lauper has one of the best voices on the planet, and she is way past her due. One of the world's most tragically underrated artists may finally get it here.<br /><br />From the opening moments of \\"Just Your Fool\\" it immediately becomes apparent that this is a heartfelt, gritty, and emotional album. And it is blues all the way. \\"Crossroads\\" is another standout, with the guitar work from Lang typically stellar. But this album does not rest strictly on the guest performances. \\"Down So Low\\" and \\"Romance in the Dark\\" are basically Cyndi's solo work, making the whole thing even more impressive.<br /><br />But the thing that impresses me the most is the fact that this is still a Cyndi Lauper album. Her signature sound and vocal phrasing is still easily recognizable, as many of the songs are comparable to the standards on her 2003 mini-masterpiece, the covers album \\"At Last.\\" As I said - it's the art that one leaves behind that determines their legacy. Some pop tarts go for shock value, and tabloid pics, and hire the latest hip-hop guru to create songs for them. Cyndi Lauper records with the legendary B.B. King. There has always been a unique twist to Cyndi's work (one would be hard-pressed to find two songs in her entire catalog that sound exactly alike), but this one tops them all. This is a major artistic statement from someone who many critics thought was 20 years past her prime. That really shows what the critics know. Do yourself a favor - buy this album.a favor - buy this album.

B00008977N|5.0|One of the best live concert videos in the business. Stunning songs, brilliant staging, musicianship, superbly filmed and great sound mix.
B001FB55L2|1.0|This movie just seemed completely useless.  I don't know what insight the movie can give you at all and the acting (other than Maguire's) seemed very hollow.  When Maguire was acting up in the kitchen, Portman's character was just too unrealistic to me.  I understand shock but her complete lack of emotion seemed fake.  The line \\"we are brothers\\" somehow meant what at the scene in front of the house.<br /><br />It seemed pretty clear to me too that there wasn't a military advisor on this movie, or if there was, he was asleep.  There were so many breaches of etiquette in the movie that it was truly distracting.  Salutes were rare in this movie yet something simple like that was botched.  Those that are not veterans may not understand how something as simple as that can take you out of the movie.  Salutes and other forms of etiquette and protocol are gestures of respect.  Not doing them is dishonorable and disrespectful.  If you are going to go through the trouble of making sure the uniform looks authentic, then you can make sure behavior is also authentic.<br /><br />I understand that many war veterans don't want or have huge difficulties in talking about what happened.  However, when it is clear that something is wrong, it would help if the audience would be given some tools on what to do.  Instead the movie just drags along with no one stepping up to the plate to do anything about it.  Even at the end - the revelation could have been taken in many ways.  Was the death accidental, metaphorical, literal, etc?  Did Portman leave it like that with her husband?  What?
0091933684|5.0|After enjoying the first Ottolenghi cookbook, I was happy to order Plenty when it was published.  I am thrilled with this addition to my cookbook collection.  I've browsed through the book (great photos and many recipes I must try soon) and made the Celeriac and Lentils with Hazelnut and Mint this weekend.  It is fantastic and I expect the rest will be as well.  I did wonder what they meant by \\"celeriac cut into 1cm 'chips'\\" though.  What is a chip?  I ended up just nicking pieces off with a knife and then cutting them smaller.  Judging from the photo, maybe they meant cut into fries?  End result great.
B001HN694K|1.0|This film was a complete disappointment.  Tim Burton is losing his place as imaginative and unique.  Alice should be a sweet, young girl who falls under the spell of a dream.  She is not the maniac as portrayed in this film.  Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are now Dweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber.  The catepillar smokes too much and the rabbit has no idea where he is going.  The Mad Hatter is completely lost along with the Red Queen.  Please take this film and throw it as far as it will go into the blackness that is called Burton-Town.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|Being somewhat behind on the release of \\"By A Thread\\", I finally got it today and it's another Smoker from the Mule Team!<br /><br />I read the reviews before I heard it, so I was kind of expecting a departure from what I'm used to hearing from Govt. Mule. Instead, I got the same thing that I love about this band. Good Rock & Roll with a bluesy kick and plenty of spice.<br /><br />It's refreshing to hear new material from the Mule. Their new addition, bass player Jorgen Carlson, adds a grindier tone to their sound. The songs are all solid goodies and well arrainged on this album. Nobody's going to replace the contributions Woody Allen or even Andy Hess has made to the band, but this sounds great!<br /><br />Billy Gibbons sits in on the first track \\"Broke Down On The Brazos\\" and you get just what you'd expect when you mix Haynes & Gibbons and stir. Kick Ass!<br />\\"Railroad Boy\\" is a nice dynamic with a twelve string and a Cappo and transitions well into \\"Monday Morning Meltdown\\" and \\"Gordon James\\", both a refreshing interlude before the album heats up and starts smokin' again with the next six tracks.<br /><br />True Mule fans are going to add this one to their collection, and if you dont have \\"By A Thread\\" already, what are you waiting for? I waited too long.......<br /><br />Hey Govt. Mule! When are y'all going to play New Mexico?!!!
0307474712|3.0|I bought this book after seeing an article about it in Entertainment Weekly, which included high praise for the novel. The story was fairly entertaining but in truth the delivery got stale in some places.    Set over a span of about 20 years in the lives of Dexter and Emma, who meet in college, the book gives the reader an update of their lives on the same day each year. It's a clever premise, but one that I do not think was taken full advantage of. The writing tended to be a bit uneven and the tone sort of pinballed between pleasantly humorous and maudlin. This led to me to start to feel disconnected from the book.     There were some good points to the book besides the premise. Nicholls took an interesting approach to the trajectories of Emma and Dexter's lives, with them going in almost completely opposite directions in terms of personal achievement and happiness. Therefore it was always interesting to see where they appeared on each other's axes at the beginning of a new section. The book also highlighed the fact that people can change their lives, no matter what age they are. In addition, I can tell you that it's rare that I'm actually shocked by events described in a book, but I was by this one (I will say no more so as not to spoil).     Overall, I pretty much went into this book thinking it had a brilliant set-up. My expectations may have been so high that they could not have been met no matter what. But to me the book was just okay.
B002WTC93S|1.0|I did not get very far into this trite book.  From the first chapter I disliked it.  We are taken to the scene of a possible attempt on the US President's life but right at the fatal moment the chapter ends.  Then we are thrown back in time by 1 month.  This is just such an obvious and stupid way to create suspense.  I think the author may have seen too many Hollywood action shows.  Or maybe he is hoping for a TV contract.
1439138311|5.0|This is a nice summer book read.  The author leaves many open story lines, and you wonder why something was even mentioned.  However, on the whole it is an easy pleasant read.
B003NWRM4O|3.0|Have read all three books. like others was a bit drawn out and repetitive at parts.Sometimes too much info giving background of government depts and also background of characters which is irrelevent to the story.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|It is almost like you are there.  I actually went to his concert in Philadelphia and thought he was great.  Now this DVD prooves me that I was right.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Morgan Freeman was superb as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon gave another top notch performance. He held his accent throughout the movie and you could actually see the change coming over him after his meeting with Mandela. All in all, a very enjoyable recreation of actual events.
630460288X|5.0|I've watched this movie every time it came on cable, so when I saw it on an amazon dvd sale I had to buy it.  It's just fun and funny to watch.  \\"All restaurants are Taco Bell now\\"...that would just be too cool !!  Buy it if you can, it is certainly owner worthy. Great Stallone flick.
B0030E1XJU|3.0|My son got this for his 5th birthday and loves it, but I'm not a fan.<br /><br />Setup: A little complicated to put everything together but not too bad (and no batteries required - hooray!).<br /><br />Play:  It's a cute little chain reaction sequence based on the movie - press the pedal and Woody flies down the zipline, which makes Hamm escape from the bin, which makes the alien slide to safety behind Big Baby's back.  It's terribly clever.  Except Hamm and the alien are not included in this playset.  Neither are Buzz and Rex, even though their pictures are prominently featured on the box.  You only get Woody and Big Baby!  We had to borrow toys from another playset to make it work. Stupid Mattel. But once we got it working, my son loved it and went through the stunt sequence over and over, switching it around. This is the only set he has but we like the idea that it can connect to other stunt sets.<br /><br />Storage: Miserable. There are a lot of pieces and no carrying case.

B00012FXAE|4.0|For all my reviews visit my website [...]    I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.    Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.    Yeah, this is a great one. The first one was great, this is even better. First off, you have TONS of Aliens, not just one. Second, the idea of bringing back the Classic Chiller is accompanied by Psychological Thriller of the 2 and a half hour long type. It's like a really...really long nightmare with just enough to keep you scared and content.     You know, the guy that says \\"man\\" every sentence, was parodied on SNL.  \\"Aw man, game over man, WE KILLED E.T. MAN!\\" That's what he said. I won't give away anything else about the SNL episode.    Whatever happened to the cat is my question! (Note: After this I immediately watched Alien 3 and I am very sunburned so excuse me in this review.)    It's incredibly long, you've got to have patience for this. But, it is awesome, it needs to be long. It takes you into the misery that people are sent into by Jack@$$'3$. I also thought that the queen looks awesome, but the idea of the queen makes things to confusing.    James Cameroon directed this one, back when he was doing GOOD movies. I ada batsche. Just great, wonderful. Not a gore fest, not a scream fest, an 80's movie...it was an 80's monster movie WHADDYA EXPECT? Except no, this was also very, very powerful. Yet at the same time a horror movie. I think the idea of having Ripley (director of Alien was Ridley Scott.) Being through all these journeys with the Aliens, but encountering different people, kinda feels like an extremely awesome TV series.    The Rating? 4.5/5.    Alright, I, Da Ca$hman signing off.

6305428557|4.0|This is a delightful story set in the Welsh countryside with a rather young Hugh Grant playing the part of a rather heroic young englishman who helps save the towns moutain from being relegated to a hill.    While a little slow the story is one that would suit a large cross section of people with a bit of humour and lots of love to make it a very pleasant story.
0785134352|4.0|The film adaptation of the creator-owned, Marvel-published Kick-Ass, by writer Mark Millar and artist John Romita Jr., just hit movie theaters around the U.S. Cue new collected edition of the book with \\"Now a Major Motion Picture!\\" emblazoned on the cover. And while many hardcore comic enthusiasts might find themselves reluctant to purchase these tie-ins, the Kick-Ass book is actually a very nice collection.    The \\"Premiere Hardcover\\" edition collects issues #1-8 of the comic, comprising the entirety of the first major story arc. Though its cover does include the aforementioned text, effectively outing purchasers as \\"fans after the release of the film,\\" it opts for new artwork by Romita on the dust cover rather than movie poster images, which is a nice touch. One version features Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl, weapons in hand, covered in blood. The other features a downtrodden Kick-Ass, sitting on his bed without his mask.     Aside from the black hardcover with yellow letters, and the collection of chapters 1-8, fans get two pages worth of bios of the comic's creators, a two-page spread of \\"Kick-Ass's Greatest Hits\\" (the most ultra-violent moments from the comics that comprise Book One), a few variant covers and a poster drawn by Romita of the characters in the movie versions of their costumes. It doesn't offer any behind-the-scenes in-depth features a la DC's Absolute editions, but it is a nice set at $24.99 to help fans get caught up with the series before or after seeing the movie.     For those unfamiliar, Kick-Ass's creators have dubbed it \\"The Greatest Superhero Comic of All Time.\\" While this may be a bit of an overstatement, the book is quite entertaining. Kick-Ass tells the tale of Dave Lizewski, a comic-book nerd just like you or me. Like everyone else, he has fantasies of being a superhero. Unlike the rest of us, he wonders why after years and years of comics no one has really given it a try. Putting on a mask and helping people doesn't sound like such a far-fetched idea to Dave.     So he orders himself the most badass scuba suit he can find on eBay and takes to the streets. For the first several weeks, he does little but patrol the rooftops. After a while, he decides to encounter a trio of hoodlums causing trouble. It doesn't go well, and he winds up with a knife in the gut; a car hits him as he stumbles away; and he wakes up severely injured in the hospital. But despite having some metal plates put in his head, suffering numerous broken bones, and burning his comics collection in defiance, Dave eventually winds up back in the suit and on the street.     His next encounter goes a bit better than the first. He gets his ass kicked again, but this time finds a way to stave off a gang of bad guys to protect their target. Someone just so happens to be recording it, and the video becomes a YouTube sensation. Embracing the modern age, Kick-Ass starts a MySpace page to learn the problems of the world, as patrolling just isn't efficient enough. It also inspires a wealth of copycats of varying qualities, and, of course, villains.     The main success Kick-Ass finds is in its \\"superheroes in real life\\" premise. Despite dealing primarily with children in costume, Millar (Civil War, Wanted) pulls no punches when it comes to the reality of a child fighting crime. It often ends in pain, and sometimes even death. It both accepts and comments on modern culture and how people become stars, and in doing so makes its premise that much more believable, as absurd as it is.     And Millar finds humor in the absurdity as well, creating some well-paced inner monologues and dialogue for big laughs that are truly earned. But its humor can also often be very high school in its tone. And as many people as there are who will embrace both this aspect and the ultra-violence of Kick-Ass, there will be just as many who find it childish and morally reprehensible. Make no mistake, Kick-Ass is brutally violent, and a 10-year-old girl who slices and dices without remorse and uses just about every swear word in the book isn't for everyone. In fact, it really shouldn't be, but Millar finds a way to make it endearing, or at the very least good fun. Kick-Ass features a \\"Mature Content\\" warning on the back, and it's not without reason, as much credited to John Romita Jr.'s gritty art as Millar's writing.       Kick-Ass also has its fair share of flaws. As much as Millar paces certain chapters, action scenes, and jokes incredibly well, he also sometimes fills panels with needless side notes and extra adult content for the hell of it. It's not perfect, and definitely not for everyone, but when it's on, Kick-Ass can be one of the more entertaining comics around, and definitely earns a unique spot in the medium, doing something new with the concept of superheroes. The greatest of all time? Probably not. Kick-ass? For sure.  -- William Jones
B00005OCMR|5.0|For all my reviews visit my website [...]<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />Well. after watching this I must say, 80's sci-fi all seems the same. But, that's a good thing, it's something thats always entertaining to watch. It's all based off Star Wars. All of it, this, Indiana Jones, everything in the 80's sci-fi genre. I love it. The plot is great, it is about a gigantic mainframe leading slaves in an order of computing inside a video game. Programs are the slaves, users wrote everything, you have to see it to understand it. Meanwhile, Flynn, this character, has wrote several games and is not getting credit for it from his boss.<br /><br />Characters? I like to view Flynn as the Luke Skywalker in this movie, and Tron is like Han Solo. Master Control Program is absoulutely the evil emperor, and Yori is princess Leia. The bit is definatly C-3PO and R2-D2. It goes on like that from there. The special effects, 80's were a milestone in special effects, it's just lately when people have been abusing it. I cannot believe I am looking at an old movie. A good way to summarize this movie is like playing Star Fox and watching Star Wars.<br /><br />You know, anybody wondering how Disney made this film, it was when Disney was scrambeling when Walt died, and they needed material without there main guy. So, they startede making Horror and Sci-Fi films...interesting. It was definatly something worth watching, very fun indeed, I'd say Popcorn compared to some, but a classic masterpiece for all time.<br /><br />The Rating? Let's face it, for what it is, it's perfect. What it is isn't perfect though, but for what it is, it's perfect. 5/5.<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman signing off.

The moving shots going up and down, just everything is beyond words for the shooting.  It's the work on genius on it's shots, it planted the ultimate apple tree seed for the farmers of tomorrow to eat from and plant more seeds. See my symbolism?<br /><br />And that's another way I think this was extremely innovative, symbolism. This was obviously done before, some of the all time greatest and favorite films before this were King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, Werewolf of London, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Nosferatu, The Phantom of the Opera, Hunchback of Notre Dame (you can see I love horror movies of that time,) but all those wonderful titles of which I have not reviewed on this site all show symoblism in something of fantasy. A giant gorilla, a vampire, a zombie mummy, a werewolf, a shape shifter, a phantom, some of them were real but are outcasts, and thus were not seen very much at the time. Citizen Kane however, delivers the symbolism in a factor of the human perspective. There's also much more of it, in Frankenstein, the whole plot is one point of symbolism, however, this carries out like a book with multiple symbols in addition to that type. I haven't really explained it have I? You would haft to see it for yourself, which I highly recommend.<br /><br />The scripting is very awesome. The idea of doing something, again, so familiar to us, is pure genius. Making it work so well. They didn't just flat out go flat, like some people these days do. But, they really did put the candy on the apple. They were also aware to make sure the candy stayed on the apple and not become it's own candy but to stay with the apple. Am I still symbolic or am I just a maniac? Oh, I haven't even talked about the greatest of things. It's done between two stories, the story of Charles Foster Kane is told through stories from his friends, and a newsreel. At the same time, we try to find out what his dying words \\"Rosebud\\" mean in the time after his death. So, they tell two stories at once. You pick any masterpiece from well, anytime but especially that time, you will probably not find that innovation. And you never really find out what Rosebud means until the end of the movie, and then, it's still done extremely symbolic and discreet.<br /><br />So, this is extremely innovative. Probably one of the top 10 innovative movies of all time. I'd say, a collection of opinions would say that these movies are the top greatest not in a specific order. Citizen Kane, King Kong (1933), Transformers (1986), Jason and the Argonauts, Casablanca, Cloverfield, Alien, Godzilla (1954) and Frankenstein (1931).<br /><br />So what is the rating? As an innovative picture and part of history, it by far deserves a 6/5. However, past the innovation, to an naive view, I'd say 4/5. Take it up to 5/5 between the two. I, Da Ca$hman signing off.t just flat out go flat, like some people these days do. But, they really did put the candy on the apple.

B00000JRTX|4.0|This is a really funny movie. I liked it years ago when I watched it the first time.  I am glad I found it on Amazon because I have never seen it out in the stores.  It is one of my husband's favorite movies, which is why I purchased it for him.
B002ZG994U|5.0|You know, we should learn to go to the movies just to be entertained.  Period.  This movie was fun, pure and simple.  It doesn't try to be anything else, and why would it want to be?
1603425381|5.0|I make a lot of small crochet projects (towels, dishcloths) and I like to add borders to my knits.  This is a great reference for someone like me who is a mid-level crocheter--I can follow the directions but can't always improvise a corner or turn from a set of directions.  The corner instructions in this book are excellent and invaluable.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|For all my reviews visit my website [...]      I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.    Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.    So, how do I describe this? Hope you can deal with my tired self and allergies self. It's Spring at 9:44 P.M. Mountain Time. So, how do I describe this? A movie that deserves a cult following. It's a movie that not every child should watch, but the most righteous  should definably check out at a young age. I feel bad that I had not. I have not even seen Love Bug, Apple Dumplings Gang, or even the original Witch Mountain movies. I feel I lost out on some real growing into a more patient man. Fortunately, I grew up good enough. But, no more whining, let's get on with the movie.     Well, lemme tell you the bad things: The original cast of Todo, Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Cowardly Lion don't play too much of a part and are replaced with Tick Tock, Jack Pumpkin Head, Gump and Melinda the Chicken. The good news on this: they're are executed in a well manner. Now, the original Wizard of Oz shall never be even matched, it's like [REFERENCE TO PUNCH-OUT]  Mike Tyson vs. Glass Joe. However, we do all love Glass Joe as Punch-Out fans, because of the awesome way he is carried out as an underdog and an over looked Gem.    And that's what this movie is, an over looked Gem. It's not a masterpiece, but still classic. My biggest thing on a kids movie is does it give you some emotions? Heck yes does this one. It scares the crap out of you especially if you are a child, and has some disturbing things for the adults. DOROTHY IS PUT IN AN ASYLUM! HOW'S THAT FOR MESSING WITH YOUR CHILDHOOD! But, she does escape. It all symbolizes the world we want to go to and the bad people in our lives who don't have a clue and try to stop it. Just like in the original, only you haft to have seen the original to spot the symbolism.     I do wish they kept the Kansas scenes B&W. But, the idea of Oz being in color in '39 was symbolic it showed the world that Oz was a beautiful fantasy in the form of symbolism. But, color was in full force at the time, and so it may have seemed to cliche to have done that way. And personally, I'm starting to realize that myself. Another thing I am mad about, is that they changed the apple trees to lunch pail trees. Seriously! Plus, there's no witches nor is there a real Wizard. It's a whole new storyline, that makes you feel like you're watching a movie that's completely different with many little references and similarities.     At this time of day, there isn't much more to talk about. I say, if you love the original but just on the right note, check it out. The Rating? 3.7/5
0385737947|5.0|When Thomas finally wakes up, the only thing he can remember is his first name. He doesn't know why he's in this metal box or how he got there. When the box stops moving and is opened, Thomas finds himself the newest addition to fifty odd boys living in what they've named the Glade. There are a few simple truths about the Glade: the stone doors to the Maze open every morning and close every night, a new boy arrives every thirty days, supplies come every week, and the Grievers usually roam the Maze at night. But Thomas's arrival is the precursor to the unraveling of this tiny world because the next day, a girl arrives with a sinister message: Everything is going to change. The Gladers have always thought that solving the Maze was the key to getting home, but now it increasingly seems that they'll be stuck here forever. Thomas won't give up, though; he's sure there has to be an end. The only problem is, the answers to freedom are securely locked within his blank memory.    The Maze Runner is without a doubt one heck of a thrill ride. From the first page of this novel to the very last, the reader is bombarded with scenes of nearly nonstop action, danger, confusion, and pain. Instead of being overwhelming, this fast paced plot is a pleasure to read. Dashner keeps the surprises popping up around every corner, and I was rarely able to even fathom what would happen next. The characters are well drawn as well. I initially thought that the placement of Thomas's sudden feelings or hints of memories were a bit rudimentary, but they make much more sense given the conclusion of the tale. I had a little difficulty understanding the ending, though, because the reasons for the existence of the Glade and the Maze weren't well explained or justified. Overall, The Maze Runner is a well written novel sure to excite readers and keep the guessing.     This novel appeals to fans of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Cherry Heaven by L.J. Adlington, and Gone by Michael Grant. I can't wait for the next installment in this thrilling trilogy.
0743289684|5.0|An incredible book by and about an incredible woman. Bravo to Ms. Hirsi Ali, for daring to challenge the status quo of fundamentalist Islam and continuing to do so despite the great danger it has put her in. Read this book and you will REALLY appreciate the importance of the separation of church and state. I can imagine what a hell it would be living in a fundamentalist Christian nation with laws based on a strict interpretation of the Bible...especially as a woman and an atheist! While there is indeed beauty and morality to be found in religion, one does not need to be of any faith in order to feel awe at a sunrise or to follow the golden rule. Meanwhile, fundamentalism of any stripe begets ignorance, intolerance and abuse of those relegated to lesser status simply because of their gender, sexual orientation or opposing belief system.
1416955070|1.0|Perhaps if you've lived under a rock for the last 30 years and never read a single book you may like this one.<br /><br />If that isn't the case, you won't enjoy it because it is a simplistic rehashing of some of literature and film's finer works.  The characters have little depth and you can see the plot coming from miles away.<br /><br />I teach University courses and if someone turned this in, I would give it a 0 for plagiarism and lack of original content.
B0026IA0QS|4.0|What more can be said about a movie as visually stunning and beautiful as Ajejandro Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre? If you haven't seen any of his previous work then this DVD is a great place start. Packed with extras, deleated scenes, and interviews, this will definately keep you satisfied. After watching this movie for the first time I thought to myself, why don't more people make movies like this anymore!?! In an age of remakes and mediocrity this film is such a breath of fresh air. After searching high and low I stumbled across a copy on [...] and found a new copy listed for $22. Got it in the mail a week later and overall very satisfied with my puchase. Dvd comes in a cardstock case and apears to be from Singapore. Whether this is a bootleg or an offical release is a mystery to me. If it is a bootleg then its the best I've ever seen. Good picture, good sound, an all around solid release! Crossing my fingers for a propper region 1 DVD or Bluray release in the near future.
B003K025V4|3.0|With all the hype surrounding Miley Cyrus' ascension into 'adulthood', propelled by her single (and video) \\"Can't Be Tamed\\", the only surprise is that there's really nothing too surprising about the new album.  It seems a natural progression for someone in her shoes...make a statement and turn some heads, don't look back and dive right in to what's current in today's pop music world.    Considering Miley doesn't particularly care for today's style of pop, she pulls off these dance-pop numbers with more than enough adequacy that fans who've stuck with her through the past couple of years are likely to be extremely satisfied with the results of this transitional album.  And for those listeners who fell in love with \\"The Climb\\", a couple of ballads here could have similar appeal.    Fuzzy-sounding keyboards and electronic percussion are the norm here, with some choruses so heavily arranged it can be difficult making out the lyrics.  Speaking of lyrics, they're actually fairly tame considering the album title.  Perhaps the most suggestive lyrics come on the record's second track, \\"Who Owns My Heart\\", where Cyrus sings \\"So come on baby, keep provoking me, keep on roping me, like a rodeo\\".      Although auto-tune vocal effects are used throughout the album mostly to thicken Miley's voice, there are only a couple of tracks with extreme Lady Gaga-type vocal pitch-shifting, including the catchy \\"Permanent December\\".  These tunes are thankfully not without melody...some, like \\"Two More Lonely People\\", \\"Stay\\" and \\"Take Me Along\\", really surprised me with their interesting ear-pleasing twists and turns.  A cover of 80's rock band Poison's \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" will probably be a 'love it or hate it' song...I find it to be an amazingly beautiful rendition myself, but wouldn't be surprised by negative reviews.    Overall, Can't Be Tamed is current and relevant...I'd be amazed if it didn't produce a handful of hits even though there's nothing too out of the ordinary here.  Grade: C+
1584282584|5.0|If you want to learn about flash photography and want to get right into it, this is the book to get! You will no longer be intimidated by your flash by the time you get with this book and PRACTICE! Before I read his book, I was one of those \\"want-to-be\\" photographer that had a $500 dust collector 580exII flash! It collected dust for about 6 months.    Quite honestly, I cannot remember how I came across his book, perhaps it was a fellow photographer that recommended it but either way, I'm very thankful for purchasing it!     You'll learn about how to bounce your flash, using filters, etc. As you see, there's another 60+ happy customers/reviewers, so stop reading the reviews and just BUY IT already!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Does this movie tacitly allude to the American invasion of Iraq and Afganistan?  Does Pandora collectively represent these two countries?  For some strange reason, I have this thought.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I just received it in the mail,  went through both dvds and I am impressed and excited.. can't wait to learn all these new techniques and I love Rachel Brice's style
B000087I2F|5.0|A Great Classic that is well directed and acted and with a plot that is perhaps more relvant today than ever before.    If the corporate take-over of our government along with our broadcast medias really disturbs you then you will love the plot in this film.  Rare insight into a corporate world that is more driven by dollar profit than by anything remotely relevant or ethical or of any real value except to perhaps an elitist few.    A great little movie!    As always wonderful prices and customer service from Amazon!    Had issue with item initially but Great Customer Support resolved it right away and without any hassle.
1588167461|5.0|This is an essential guide for anyone who has to wear clothes! I grew up not knowing half of what was in this book, to my disadvantage. Once I saw what was in it, I was so surprised. I started paying attention to what I wore and received compliments at work. I bought two more copies for friends. They are delighted!
B001FB55I0|5.0|REALLY loved this version. Story was more cohesive than the studio suits allowed it to be in the theatrical release. McG is a fine story teller and was made more evident in this director's cut. If there is more coming,will buy that too!  MOON BLOODGOOD IS HOT in this movie!!! Love seeing her on screen.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|This album has great production, good riffs, excelent musicians, but something is missing. We have here a few top of the line tracks, some more 'ok' ones , and a couple of crappers.  It's the melody Ozzy!<br />As for the new axeman, my respects.  He sounds between randy and Zakk, yes, and maybe thats what sharon wanted.  His playing is great, but still he has a lot to go before reaching Randy and Zakk's stature.
B001I1DEV2|5.0|This book is one of the most checked out books in my elementary school library. I have had kids fight over it and cry when it isn't on the shelf! I especially love the amazing artwork of all of the wildlife in the movies. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a child who loves Star Wars.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I have all of these on VHS and I've been looking forward to replacing them with DVDS.  Excellent collection at a great price.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Cyndi Lauper was one of those artists in the 80's that I didn't really care for. Her style of dress was outlandish and her musical material was bubble gum at best. But I have learned that it is those strange artists that can surprise you. As in this new release from Cyndi Lauper. Memphis Blues has heart and soul, and is every bit of the blues as the blues should be. The vocals are amazingly mature and full of passion for the music.. And the music is certainly the kind that one would hear in a an old blues club filled with the blue smog of too many smokers bad habits. Memphis Blues is top notch and shows what an artist can do when they decide to mature and explore new horizons. Earlier today I wrote reviews for two rock legends cd's, (Ozzy Osbourne and Vince Neil.) Both of those albums were uneventful throwbacks to a time in musics past. Then along comes someone like Cyndi Lauper and blows them both out of the water with passion and style... Kudos Cyndi.
1572814136|5.0|This deck is great because it's the traditional design by Rider-Waite, but the colors are so much brighter. Great Deck for learning and for advanced Tarot practitioners.
B003HLM2QO|1.0|The new offering by Ozzy is what one would expect to hear from this master of black metal.. and I don't mean that in a positive way. After being in the music business for so many years, what is left for Ozzy to do? He could show a bit of musical maturity, and branch out into some bold new areas, but alas, he refuses to do so. Instead, Ozzy tries to sound heavier and ballsier by mixing some new modern rock elements into his music. The result; this album is not the most melodic offering since Bark At The Moon and Ultimate Sin.. Those were great albums. But Scream is an uneventful listen that mader me feel unpleasantly annoyed by the time the disc ended. The album was chaotic and suffered from a lack of melody and reason. Ozzy shows us that he can still rock hard, but that doesn't mean he rocks well on his latest.
0385341008|5.0|Very unique in setting up the story with the use of letters between characters.  Historically accurate although fiction.
B003KT3NRA|1.0|I loved the 1980's.. the music was fun. But when these MTV rock stars of the past put out new albums, it's a shame and a sham. Vince Neil's latest tries to go back and show us that he can still sqeal just as well as he did on Shout at the Devil.. but that's all Vince does hear is squeal. The songs are boring, non-melodic hogwash that makes one question how any record label signed him up. If you like songs that have no melody, has lots of screaming and a chorus that is almost non-existant, then you'll be head over heels for this one. But if you like well crafted rock music with melodies that stick to your ribs for weeks on end, then flee this jumbled mess of an album.
1849162743|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\"  is indeed a  fitting end to the three-book series.  I cannot rate it as above or below the previous two books.  It is just so excellent. And it is literature.  Not  just a thriller. So sad that there will never be another Larsson,  Is there somewhere an article, a profile of Stieg himself? The New Yorker should be interested, right?
B0039SFKSW|4.0|If you're like me and found that Asia's reunion album \\"Phoenix\\" left you wanting more, then you won't be disappointed with \\"Omega.\\"  There are a few weak tracks (surprisingly, they are the opening and closing tracks of the album), but \\"Holy War\\", \\"Through My Veins\\", and \\"There Was a Time\\" are among the best songs the band has ever recorded.  Other highlights are \\"Light the Way\\" and a timeless ballad called \\"Ever Yours.\\"  Over all, \\"Phoenix\\" is a better album because there is a consistent quality to the songwriting throughout, where \\"Omega\\" has some really outstanding songs and some forgettable ones as well.  The album has grown on me and it is enjoyable, but the band's weakness is that their musical ideas are much stronger than the lyrics.  Yes will always outshine Asia, in part, because of Jon Anderson's great talent for writing lyrics.  My hope would be that Steve Howe would contribute more of the songwriting on any future Asia projects because \\"Through My Veins\\" is a great song.  The virtuosic playing of all four members that has made Asia a great band is very much present on this recording.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have a personal rule of not buying a DVD after I see the film in the movie unless the actor's performance, cinematography, special effects are exceptional.  This movie exceeded my expectations.  I can look at it repeatedly to find new enjoyment.
B000P0J09W|2.0|I heard great things about this movie, so when I finally saw this I was glad I didn't see in the theater. In fact, I didn't miss anything. The story is predictable and the kids chatter so much it was annoying. The adult villains, as usual, are comic caricatures that nobody could possibly be afraid of. No attempt is made to reflect the reality of real kids' lives, and everything, from the Sloth creature to the treasure hunt, is so rooted in fantasyland that you don't believe that any of it could happen in real life. In other words, the film is nothing more than an amusement park ride or a Rube Goldberg project (which it shows again and again). It operates on a purely superficial level - you suspend disbelief and have to ignore all the ridiculous things in it too make it work.<br /><br />I felt many scenes were forced - all the kids' expressions didn't seem natural, but fake, everything was \\"on cue\\"; their laughter or fearful expressions didn't seem inspired or spontaenous. I believe the curse words were put there in a desperate attempt to make the kids sound real, but they just sounded Hollywoodized.<br /><br />In comparison, take a look at the Disney live action kids films of the 70s, like \\"Candleshoe\\" and \\"Escape to Witch Mountain.\\" Fewer special effects, a bit dated, no curse words, but genuinely moving as well as exciting and the kids were always believable. As it was, this film left me cold. I think the Chinese kid's bag of gadgets represents what this film is all about - a bunch of gags and tricks, but after the magic act's over, you're bored and want to go home.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story 3 seems to spell the final chapter in the saga of Andy's toy chest. Andy is now 17 and heading off the college. His Mom wants him to clear out his room before he goes -- anything that does not go with him or into the attic will keep trucked to the curb and out of his life forever. Obviously, this causes distress in his toy chest, whose denizens, while wildly loyal to Andy, have not been played with in years, and worry about what will happen to them. The movie spins out this drama believably and touchingly. The standard menagerie of Toy Story toys -- Woody, Buzz Lightyear, the slinky dog, Pig, and Dinosaur are all on hard. Along with a whole crew of nice and not-very-nice toys from a local daycare and at a local girl's house. And let's not forget to mention scene-stealing Barbie and Ken, with his enormous...wardrobe.<br /><br />Pixar has to be commended or taking an  old franchise and keeping it fresh.  There's enough danger, humor, genre allusions and prankishness for everyone to enjoy, old and young. The animation is firt rate. The work that went into Woody's loose-limbed gait was phenomenal. And some scenes that take place by the light of a glow-in-the-dark toy are breathtaking. The voicing was pitch-perfect, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprising their old roles without irony or fatigue. Some of the film is dark and scary, with its overtones of prison movies, which might frighten the really little kids who won't understand what is going on. And the numerous \\"gay Ken\\" allusions were tiresome. I saw the film in 3D which did little to enhance the jaw-dropping animation, great voicing, terrific characters and superb plot.<br /><br />A brilliant film, entertaining, affecting, gorgeously crafted and respectful of itself and its audience.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|Truly, honestly.... because if you listen to it the first time, you will get the same vibe that most of us do.  I had to put it away and today, a year later, I decided to give it another chance and it's really growing on me!  I first was expecting this album to sound like Personal Jesus (Violator) or Music for the Masses and any of the previous albums with very good upbeat tempos but I found it to be very depressing.... or so I thought.  It's actually mellow but it's not at all different than most of the mellow stuff they have put out in the past.  It's just that the album is pretty much these types of mellow deep songs.  Give it another chance, DP fans!  I am glad I did!  :)  Sometimes you do need to take a break from electronica dance tunes.
B00002496X|4.0|i hadn't heard theses songs in such a long time. my old cd was scratchted and i couldn't find it anywhere. thanks for the excellent quality and great condition cd
B001HN694K|2.0|This flick has a lot of problems.  It is really just clips from other films re-shot.  It would have been better maybe, or a little more entertaining at least, had they just used clips from the other movies.  For example, if you splice together Lord of The Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia you have seen this film, but unfortunately this film is still not interesting.  The film has some good points and lines, but because of its problems these seem like cheese on a lousy meal.          And the special effects may be groundbreaking (I don't know if they are, and I'm not about to look into it because I already feel this film has wasted too much of my time) but they don't really look convincing.  Tweedledee and Tweedledum for example look like what they are- a man's face stretched and morphed onto a CG body.  This kept taking me out of the story.  Not that it took much to take me out of it since it was boring and didn't make sense.  Why does Alice come to Wonderland the first time?  Where is Wonderland?  Who are the Red and White Queens?  What happened between them and why is the Red Queen able to hold power?  Why is Alice the only one that can restore the White Queen?      Instead of answering these questions and making an interesting movie we get the following:  Alice is to be wed in real life, but!...she doesn't want to and the guy is creepy!  She walks away from the proposal to have a think and falls down a big, big hole.  She sees some folks who ask her if she is Alice.  Is she?  Isn't she?  Is she again?  Isn't she again?  Maybe she is.  Maybe she isn't.  One thinks she is.  But no, perhaps she is not.  After some chases there is a big battle.  Oh my God- it's a battle between the Red and White Queen!  What!  Then the White Queen gets back the crown, and the Red Queen goes away.  Roll credits.    The cover of the DVD tells you that this film doesn't really have a direction.  Alice, our main character who takes up the majority of screen time, is to the side on the cover looking off at what, we don't know.  The Mad Hatter is in the center of the cover, skipping along, looking at us for some reason (this role could have been interesting, if the subtleties of this character were explained in the movie- bit they aren't, enough said).   And the Rabbit is also on the cover- oh my God! - listening to his clock; I have never seen that before!     This movie put all its eggs in the computer animation basket, and since they don't really help the already very slighted story, the whole thing is a boring wash.  Alice could have been a good film if it had been a film and not just a technical and marketing exercise.

B001B6EAOY|2.0|I bought this item, to use with my Sony Flash Camcorder, but when you start the camcorder and every time you start and stop the recording a message pop up on the screen for 30 seconds covering the whole screen and at the same time playing an annoying bell sound, telling that the Memorystick is not compatible and that the recording may not work. It will record, at least the one minute I tried, but you are unable to see what you record for the first 30 seconds.
0810993139|5.0|My son hadn't been the most enthusiastic reader in the world, but he devoured the first four books in this series, reading them over and over. He wanted me to read them with him and finally I went along with the idea ...    And I discovered these books are great! Each book has places where I have to stop reading I'm laughing so hard. It reminds me of when I was my son's age and the humor of MAD magazine seemed so outrageous compared to everything else.    At first I was disturbed that there are some situations that are morally ambiguous, where the main character does the wrong thing ... I'm used to the old-school notion of books that model good moral behavior. But it can be more rewarding to read something like this and discuss with your kid what he/she would do, what he/she thinks would be the right thing.    I just see that book 5 is available for pre-order and I immediately clicked on the link. Even if (and this is utterly and completely won't happen impossible) my son decided he didn't want the book I would still get it just for myself to read.    Got a son over seven years old? GET THIS BOOK!
1584282584|5.0|This book has been the biggest difference maker for me as an advanced ametuer.    warning - this book assumes a basic level of camera knowledge:  how to determine basic exposure; how apeture and shutter speed affect exposure; and how to use your camera.  Lastly - you'll need a speedlight for your camera- the built in \\"pop-up\\" flash that most cameras have is not flexible enough to bounce off side walls.    That said, even if you don't know how to determine basic exposure or work your camera - I STILL think this book is for you... just get it and work your way up to it.  It really is THAT good, in my opinion.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|I'd heard that this was a \\"difficult\\" book, that it required \\"work\\" of its readers.    For me this book was a breeze, and what makes it a breeze is the always present humor. I would have been happy enough with a shallow but amusing farce, but what surprised me was the depth you burrow into the psyches of the characters. The descriptions of AA meetings in particular are very effectively written. It's not as if you're there ... you're more than there ... you're inside the head of someone as each thought bubbles to the surface. What an amazing writer!    And lest you think Mr. Wallace abuses his talent for strictly high-brow dramatic purpose, there is plenty in the book to make you laugh out loud. The humor softens the emotional blows and greases the long rails of this transcontinental journey of a book. In a handful of places it doesn't work but in more thousands of places than you can count the humor is clever and unusual and your day ... well the next hour anyway ... is richer because of it.    I was only a quarter of a way through this mammoth book when I started to dread finishing it ... I wanted it to go on forever.    I would highly recommend the Kindle edition of this book, for three reasons:     1) there are a lot of footnotes, literally hundreds. On the Kindle it's simple to go to the text of the footnote and then go back to where you left off in the text. In fact some of the footnotes even have footnotes, and the Kindle handles this with ease.     2) The book has a rich vocabulary, and I found myself having to look up (in the Kindle's built-in dictionary) lots of words.     3) The dead-tree version is big and heavy, not the kind of thing you'd want to drag onto the train or bus every day, or even hold up while laying in bed. Especially not along with a dictionary which IMHO (see above point) is needed.    In fact this book is so fantastic, and the Kindle makes reading it so much easier, that I would recommend getting a Kindle just to read this book!    Thisis one of the best books I've read in my life. Although elements of it are similar to other books, the unique mix of what makes up \\"Infinite Jest\\", and the huge canvas upon which it's all portrayed, make this a book that is like no other I have read. I look forward to reading it again a few years down the road (another Kindle plus: you don't need the shelf space to store it!).    Take a fifth of Kurt Vonnegut (approx [[ASIN:0385334206 Breakfast of Champions]] era, without the science fiction), a fifth of Philip Roth (for the long introspective passages), a fifth of [[ASIN:B000000HQA D.P. Gumby, Flower Arranger]] then shoot the editor and add in two fifths of whatever is wild and funny and sad in this world and you have an idea of what \\"Infinite Jest\\" is.    This is an amazing and vastly entertaining book. I can guarantee you that I will be reading whatever new work David Foster Wallace publishes for years to come.
B0007TKNCY|1.0|I watched this movie because I had read reviews stating it was hilarious. It was not. This movie was not funny at all, in fact it was extremely annoying. Katherine Hepburn's character was so irritating I had a hard time watching the entire thing. As someone else mentioned, there was no chemistry between the two of them. Cary Grant made me half chuckle once. If you want a funny Cary Grant movie stick to Arsenic and Old Lace.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie is by far my favorite out of the series.  I was in line the day it came out, more excited than the little kids surrounding me.<br /><br />It raises the question of \\"What happens to the toys when the kid outgrows them\\"?  The story follows Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and the whole gang as they find out the answer first hand.  The answer left me in tears and feeling guilty about getting rid of my toys, over the years.  lol<br /><br />Toy Story 3 does an excellent...more than excellent...job of not falling into the trap that sequels always fall into.  (They shouldn't have been made and the filmakers should've just stopped with the first one).  But, the third installment of Pixar's Toy Story went to infinity and beyond (yeah, I went there) on living up to the hype that was surrounding the movie, as soon as word of it came out.<br /><br />There were plenty of laughs and plenty of tears throughout the movie, but overall it was a very heart-felt and a very wonderful movie that I plan on seeing multiply times and buying as soon as it hits the shelves.  You will not be disappointed in the least.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|After 260 reviews, there isn't much left that I can say about this book. The truth is that most reviews of this book are driven by more than just this individual novel's content. They are driven by the Larsson trilogy and the fact that this is the likely end of the series since he passed away prior to publication. There are rumors of additional, albeit unfinished manuscripts. One can only hope for more, by some miracle.<br /><br />In any event, as to this book...I consider it to be the worst of the three. It was entertaining but the first 100 or so pages were dry and way too detail oriented. Just details that we didnt need. However, once this book gets going, it really becomes as engrossing as the others. I felt a sense of sadness as I charged down the home stretch, knowing it was almost over.<br /><br />The bottom line is this. If you havent read any of these books, DO NOT START HERE. This is a book for those that were lucky enough to find the first two. Start at the beginning. Stieg Larsson has created a cast of enduring characters, that like himself, left us too soon. While it is a sad knowledge to have while reading this series, you just cannot pass up the opportunity to meet \\"The Girl\\" and all of her cohorts.<br /><br />Rest in Peace Mr. Larsson, your work will last for many lifetimes.

031606792X|1.0|This book was terrible. It was totally different than the others in the saga. I was so disappointed. The characters were out of character. It felt as if the author was forced to come up with something quick just to get the book out on time. I've read Twilight fan fiction better than this. It took me a while to finish this book because the more I read, the more I hated it. If you're a fan of Twilight and haven't read Breaking Dawn, my suggestion is to just skip it. Come up with your own ending. I promise it will be better than this!

B003KUSUG8|5.0|This has to be the best album i heard in long time. This remembers me of the old Eminem we, his fans heard in earlier album. This is as the title is called, The Recovery of his career , abuse of drugs and lose of his best friend, Proof R.I.P..The album is has to be most creative because he has used alot of different Producers on the songs. So, some fans may at first not like the beats on the album. The lyrics on all the songs are on point. You have a taste of all the different forms of him, from a serious, Talking to Myself & Going Thorough Changes; funny, W.T.P. & Almost Famous; Emotional, Love the Way You Lie & 25 to Life. The album is very well put together. It has a feeling that it flows from song to song. I personally like a few songs better than  other but all are good. The album is in my opinion the best rap album of year  and could be consider best over all album as well. It is a best buy for anyone who like hip-hop, music or who trying to get over somethings.

0375836675|4.0|I ordered this book because I loved \\"the Book Thief\\" by the Zusak.  It is very well written and I love the<br />way he develops his characters and gets you involved in their lives.  Probably not meant for older people like myself but a good read nonetheless.  He has an unusual ability to make the plot less important than the humanity of his characters.  I think this is a rare skill in novels that are not about crime, violence, or espionage.  His books are more about growing up, integrity, friendship and what it means to be a good person.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Because it had been 11 years since we last saw Woody and Buzz on the big screen and the first two films were so awesome, this was to be the runt of the trilogy. Probably good entertainment for two hours but obviously a ploy by Pixar to squeeze as much money possible from their most beloved franchise while they still could. Now that I've seen Toy Story 3 I'm both happy and humbled to report that I was wrong.    Like Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3 begins with a bang. Those who remember how the first two Toy Story movies begin should be able to tell immediately what's going on. After a little bit of fun lighthearted drama, we see a series of flashbacks through old videos and images of Andy playing with his toys through the years. We see that gradually he's growing up and when the camera ends and darkness comes we are brought to the present day. He is now 17 and about to go to college. Andy has outgrown his toys and while they have gotten used to staying in boxes they still desperately yearn for any kind of attention from him. Even being held briefly by him is now a moment to be cherished. These are bleak times for the toys and Woody, the unofficial leader of the group, tries to keep everyone's spirits up by clinging to any type of positive thinking that can be mustered. Only a handful of the toys from the first two films are still with Andy (many of them have been sold at yard sales and others donated). Despite being ignored, they still have a loyalty to Andy because he's kept them and are content with staying in the attic if that's what he wants. Woody points out that someday Andy might have kids and they might get played with again. However, a misunderstanding convinces all of them (save Woody) that Andy no longer wants them and they seek to be donated to the local daycare center. At Sunny Side day care center, these \\"NEW TOYS!\\" are pleased with their first impressions of everything. The toys seem nice. The kids seem nice. And the idea of not having an owner appeals to them. However, first impressions can be misleading...    That's all of the plot I'm willing to reveal. Let me say that this is easily my favorite Pixar movie since the original Toy Story in 1995. It made me laugh which is not always easy. Ken is a welcome addition to the Toy Story family and, alongside Barbie, share many of the most memorable scenes in the movie. And Spanish speaking Buzz is even funnier than I could have imagined from the commercials.    The villain of this movie is in some respects the most evil of all the Toy Story villains like Sid, Sid's dog, Al the toy collector, Stinky Pete, and even evil emperor Zerg! And towards the end there is one particular moment where his wickedness is fully revealed. Who knew that such evil could be in the form of a teddy bear that smells like strawberries!    For a movie that took over a decade to get to the screen, it's amazing how relevant and integral it is to this trilogy. In retrospect it even kind of seems like Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were mere stepping stones to this movie where the big questions about children's relationship with toys would finally be tackled.    Toy Story 3, in contrast to what a lot of critics suggest, won't make everyone cry. It won't even make most people cry. But it's guaranteed to melt the coldest hearts, make the sternest face smile, and, yes, make a few people sob. The ending was, for me, the best ending to a Pixar movie (even though it was borderline cheesy) and is probably my favorite ending to any movie since Shawshank Redemption's ending. Many people will say they were sad but I was happy because I knew it had to happen. The ending also makes this trilogy complete and, though a Toy Story 4 is not impossible, it seemed like the creators were saying to the audience that this is the final curtain call. Of course, if this movie makes a lot of money the executives might reconsider but for the moment I don't think there are any plans to do a \\"4\\".    And if the day ever comes when they decide to go back into the attic and dust off these old toys for one more adventure, I'll be lining up to see it and expect nothing less than an awesome movie. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading these reviews and go see it right now.

0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism\\" is a journalistic tour de force. Over nearly 600 pages of text, she traces the rise and implementation of neo-liberal economic ideology in many times and places: 1960s Indonesia under Suharto's coup and his allies in the Berkeley Mafia, in the Southern Cone in the 1970s and in particular in Pinochet's Chile, in Brazil, in Thatcher's UK, 1980s Bolivia, in China following Tiannamen, in Germany, Poland and Russia following the collapse of communism, in South Africa following the fall of Apartheid, in the Asian financial crisis, in post-9/11 USA with the homeland security bubble, in post-9/11 Israel with the same homeland security bubble, in the Iraq war, in New Orleans following Katrina, and in places like Sri Lanka that were victims of the 2005 Tsunami. The cases that get the most attention are Pinochet's Chile, Russia under Yeltsin and Iraq under the USA. As the book was put out in 2007, it does not include the current American financial crisis, it does say later on that the USA is headed toward economic collapse, something Klein might wish she had elaborated on.    The narrative, which is primarily descriptive rather than analytical, is informative if nothing else. Readers will learn of the \\"Chile Project\\", a plan to have Chile's brightest economic students receive their graduate education at the University of Chicago. The plan was so successful that Pinochet's finance minister, Sergio de Castro, was one of the alumni, and it would be further implemented to impact the rest of Latin America. The reader will learn that Margaret Thatcher seemed unlikely to hold on to power, up to and until she decided to fight a war over a previously marginalized and neglected piece of land: The Falklands Islands. Following the war, Thatcher would go on to use the same propaganda tactics against coal miners, referring to them as \\"the enemy within\\", while the Friedmanite Junta in Argentina lost power.    The comprehensive historical referencing is necessary for Klein's thesis. Her thesis is that neo-liberal economic philosophy has not been able to win support democratically, and that it has been implemented throughout the world via the use of shocks. Over time, the promoters of neo-liberalism have grown aware of this and have taken on an approach to incorporate that into their long-term planning, \\"instability is the new stability\\" and allow shocks to take place. She brings up the use of torture and makes it not only relevant but integral. She points out that many of the most economically \\"liberal\\" regimes were also the most repressive, and her argument is that it may be impossible to run economic liberalism without a police state to enforce it. Milton Friedman is quoted dismissing this notion as silly. Following his visit to China in 1989, he wrote a letter to a student newspaper asking them if they would critique him for supporting a regime like China, implied to be different from that of Pinochet's Chile [Friedman had visited Chile in 1975 and had said Pinochet's regime was off to a good start]. A few months later the Tiananmen massacre took place. Klein introduces the reader to a narrative of the massacre ignored by the North American press. An alternative narrative, advanced by - among others - Wang Hui in his 2003 book \\"China's New Order\\", is that it was not merely about \\"democracy versus communism,\\" the protesters were against the corporatization of China's economy underg Deng Xiaoping. Milton Friedman was in fact supporting a regime much like Pinochet's Chile.    Torture is not just used as a supporting device to neoliberalism, to keep dissidents in line. Klein argues that it's also a metaphor to the shock doctrine, what torture does to the individual, the shock doctrine does to societies. It was found in studies, conducted in the 1940s and 1950s, that an optimal interrogation strategy was to shift from sensory overload to sensory deprivation. With these methods, as opposedto rote sadism, victims might suddenly regress to behaving like children, crawling on all fours, being incontinent at both ends and sucking their thumb. Psychologists like Ewen Cameron believed that this was the blank slate, a fantasy neurological state of behaviorist psychology on which any psychology could be imprinted. By destroying the old individual, a new better individual could be built. Cameron achieved great success at destroying individuals, but never anything other than failure in rebuilding newer, better individuals. Upon destroying the individual, rubble and ruins are left behind, not a plain field. While this was shown in the case of individuals, it was not shown, or rather it was shown and not widely understood, in the case of societies. When the USA moved into Iraq with its aptly named \\"Shock and Awe\\" campaign,  one of the leaders dismissed accusations of \\"nation building\\". He said it was \\"nation creating\\", the implication that Iraq was a blank slate. Another major figure, John Agresto, director of higher education reconstruction for the occupation, commented that he had never read any books on Iraq, because he wanted to lead with as open a mind as he could have. A Mormon missionary thought that the Book of Mormon would open eyes in Iraq, and that he would eventually be a hero of Iraqi history for spreading his gospel. The reader is informed that the military knew that museums, holding ancient Mesopotamian artifacts, might be looted, but that the leadership deliberately chose not to protect them. The National Museum of Iraq lost 80% of its 170,000 objects. Meanwhile, some saw the looting as a form of rapid privatization... it would accelerate the destruction of the country, allowing a new country to be rebuilt on Friedmanite grounds. \\"I thought the privatization that occurs sort of naturally when somebody took over their state vehicle, or began to drive a truck that the state used to own, was just fine,\\" said Peter McPherson, the senior economic adviser to Paul Bremer (Klein, page 427).    The Iraq war ties into the Homeland Security Bubble, a Bush-era source of \\"economic growth\\" in the USA which is never mentioned in the mainstream media. Both Rumsfeld and Cheney had at least tens of millions of dollars of assets coming into their positions, with many of those held on. This gave them a direct interest in privatizing the military, a position Rumsfeld advocated in a September 10, 2001 speech to US generals, where he compared the Pentagon bureaucracy to the Soviet Union. As of the book's publishing, the Pentagon sends US$ 270 billion to private contractors. Washington became the next silicon valley. There were 2 security-oriented lobby firms in 2001, but by mid-2006 there were 543. Cameras, data mining, image recognition are a tough business. The CEOs of the top 34 defense contractors enjoyed a 108% compensation increase between 2001 and 2005, compared to a 6% average at other large American companies in that period.    As an aside, the book also benefits from the best explanation I've seen of the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. What is known is that there was some popular support for peace in Israel in the 1990s, and that this support went away and was replaced by a more hardline outlook. I've never seen this explained in a satisfying manner in the mainstream press, and I was interested in Klein's two points on this regard. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ironically caused by \\"Washington Consensus\\" shock policies such as privatization,  there was an influx of nearly 1 million Russians into Israel, equivalent to a ~20% increase in population. At this point, Israeli businesses no longer needed Palestinians for cheap labour. The borders would often be closed off, leading to catastrophic economic problems in the Palestinian territories, amplified by Israel's refusal to allow Palestinians to trade with other countries, which in turn fed terrorism. Additionally, following the 9/11 WTC bombings, there was a homeland security bubble throughout the world, a bubble I've also never seen mentioned in the mainstream press (only the housing bubble is discussed) but well documented in The Shock Doctrine. Israel's leaders, who previously had a vision of themselves as the Singapore of the Middle East, now had another vision, that of a futuristic fortress. Israeli corporations benefit from the media analysis of their anti-terrorism dealings because it is free marketing for their police state technologies. In its December 12th, 2005 issue, Forbes magazine declared Israel \\"the go-to country for anti-terrorism technologies\\".  Here's a link to the article: [..]    This comprehensiveness is depressing. The book was a page turner, in my case, but also a teeth gnasher. The dominance of neoliberal philosophy appears to be total, and it succeeds virtually wherever it goes in the period 1965-2005. Solidaire was hijacked in Poland, and the African National Congress turned its freedom charter, which it had held on for nearly forty years, into a joke once it achieved power.  It's begun undermining the very apparatus of its enforcement, the united states military, an entity that was largely privatized under Rumsfeld. Every so often when individuals do end up leaving the fold, they don't go very far, for example Jeffrey Sachs going to debate war with his former friends to argue that more foreign aid is the solution... as if there are no complete ideological alternatives. Perhaps there aren't.        *  In the 1980s, Sachs was a young Harvard celebrity professor, who brought the shock doctrine to Bolivia, where inflation went down and unemployment went up, which he calls a success.      * He was brought to Poland in the early 1990s. They liked the way he was able to raise foreign aid with his connections. He did the same in Poland, moving the Soldaire party to the right, though it took time to convince them.      * He tried to do the same in Russia, they got the shock doctrine but to his surprise he wasn't able to raise foreign aid this time. In her interviews with Sachs, he apparently believes that they (the IMF economists) were lazy in not analyzing the Russia situation, which he thinks warranted a Marshall Plan. Klein implies that Sachs is blind, and that the IMF crowd didn't give aid to Russia because they wanted it to fail.      * He is now in open ideological disagreement with the IMF crowd and advocating debt forgiveness. He has moved from Harvard's economic department to Columbia's.     If I had written a book like this I might have contemplated suicide. I suspect this is where her last chapter \\"Shock Wears Off\\" originates... perhaps her publisher told her that her text was too gloomy, and she needed at least some bloomy to compensate. In her last chapter, she argues it is difficult to pull off the shock doctrine on the same population multiple times. She argues that the current socialist successes in Latin America are largely due to the excesses of the Juntas in the 1970s and 1980s. If true it's a nice story, but I wonder if there's more. Are there truly more successes in Latin America now than there were in other parts of the world in other decades? Is the region better protected than South Korea, Thailand, etc were before the Asian Financial Crisis hit? If Valenzuela is such a beacon of socialism, how has the US military not yet bombed the country? I guess history will tell. I do want to believe Klein's final conclusion, that shock wears off, but it is hard to do so following her encyclopedic cataloguing of their skill at manipulating the world over the previous four decades.
030726999X|3.0|If you haven't read the first two novels in the Larsson series, I wouldn't try to read this one. I did read the first two, and I was lost at first, desperately searching for context clues.<br /><br />It doesn't help that there are so many characters in HORNET'S NEST, many of whom have similar sounding names. There's Niedermann and Nieminen and Nystrom. There's Bjurman and Bjorck and Ekstrom and Edklinth. We desperately need a glossary here.<br /><br />Another drawback is Larsson's emphasis on groups and institutions. The bad guys belong to a secret section of the Sapo, the Swedish CIA. There's also another group called the Constitutional Protection Agency, which helps Mikael Blomkvist ferret out the members of The Section, the secret group within the Sapo. We also have Milton Security, for whom Lisbeth Salander once worked as an investigator, and a regular cop named Bublanski who has a couple of lieutenants. The problem here is that these people are always planning strategy, very often repeating stuff we, as readers, already know. It gets old in a hurry.<br /><br />Meanwhile Lisbeth Salander is in a hospital recuperating from a bullet to the head. So, what we have is the most compelling character in the book out of action for most of it. What passes for a climax is a cross examination of Lisbeth's psychiatrist, Dr. Teleborian, with a predictable conclusion.<br /><br />Along with the bureaucratic finagling, we have a \\"B\\" story involving Erika Berger, who has resigned from MILLENIUM to take a job with one of the biggest newspapers in Stockholm. But the job is a lot bigger than she expected and almost immediately she must deal with a stalker. I was tempted to skip these parts to find out what was happening with Lisbeth.<br /><br />Larsson also provides a \\"notes\\" section at the end of the book where we find out about some of the possible inspirations for his trilogy. For instance, there was a secret intelligence agency within the Swedish armed forces similar to The Section. They were exposed by journalists Jan Guillou and Peter Bratt.<br /><br />The Salander trilogy is a very popular series in Sweden and is rapidly gaining fans in America. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO has been made into a movie in Sweden, and one is in the works in America. Rumor has it that before his death Larsson had finished about half of the fourth book and that he had outlines for ten altogether. Now all we need is an author. I nominate Jeffery Deaver.

Yeah some funny punchlines thrown in and some decent flows on verse 2 but with a crappy chorus can't say I love the track. It's not an amazing opener but a decent song none the less.     2. Talkin' 2 Myself - 9 - Amazing song talking about problems Em went through in last few years. He covers mostly issues on his mindset towards the rap game and such. The chorus done by Kobe is great and overall makes it a great song about Em's problems.     3. On Fire - 7 - Feels like a filler track. A few decent lines, a funny chorus, but a boring beat. Overall the weakest track on the album for me.     4. Won't Back Down - 7.5 - Some great punchlines but the beat is to loud for Em. However the flow on third verse is amazing. Decent song, good for the car.     5. W.T.P. - 8 - Funny goofy song with a fun chorus. Third verse actually has some great lines.     6. Going Through Changes - 9.5 - Besides a so/so final verse the song is amazing. Amazing chorus, amazing story told, a great beat, and most of all sad yet very truthful.     7. Not Afraid - 8.5 - The message is strong in this one. One or two corny lines and a so/so beat don't stop this single from being a great song.     8. Seduction - 8.5 - A great check to just sit back and vibe through. Eminem takes a twist on a love song and makes it that he sounds SO good he'll steal your girl from you with his music itself. Some great punchlines and a great beat.     9.No Love - 9 - An amazing song when it comes to Em's verse. Actually some of the best stuff he's ever written in his life. Also the sample is amazing. Lil wayne does a decent enough job.     10. Space Bound - 9 - Blown away by the beat. The first and third verse are amazing. A weak middle kinda hurts it but overall an amazing song that you can feel his love/hate and pain.     11. Cinderella Man - 8.5 - Good beat and two kickass verses held back by a weak chorus. Another verse and a better chorus would make this another Till I collapse.     12. 25 To Life - 9.5 - One of the best on the album. Eminem uses a theme used before on many rap songs yet doesn't reveal it to the very end. His anger sounds very real, the chorus is amazing, the beat is perfect, the lyrics are top notch. I wished it was another verse otherwise this song is one of the best on the album.     13. So Bad - 8 - Fun song once again. Funny lyrics, catchy chorus, and easy to vibe with track.     14. Almost Famous - 10 - Best song on the album. Eminem is back on his 8 Mile/SSLP vibe. He's angry, he's upset, he's mad, he's hyped, and most of all sounds hungry again. This is the eminem song that got me into eminem and every time it begins to play I get a hyped vibe.     15. Love The Way You Lie - 9 - Great single for eminem. Chorus is great, first and final verse are top notch. Even the second verse is decent. Overall the beat works well with both artist and overall the song is amazing.     16. You're Never Over - 9 - Great tribute to proof. Em lost his best friend but he doesn't wanna make a depressing song about it, he wants to celebrate his friends life when he was alive. However don't get confused, this song still can make you shed a tear. You can hear Eminem's sadness in this yet how proud he was to be friends proof. It was an amazing song, chorus and all. Just wish his first verse was as good as his second.     17. Untitled - 8.5 - Great finish up track and a fun track to go off on. It's funny, some great punchlines, good beat, great flow. He goes in hard on verse 2 and then verse 3 finishes it off great. Great track, similar to criminal and such.     Overall Eminem is BACK and in full force. Listen rappers out there, the king is back. You had 8 years to take over this game and now the man who releases 3 classics in a row is back in full force.
0316069906|5.0|Foer does a great job of objectively analyzing every aspect of the realities and ramifications of eating animals in today's world - he does this in a normal, accessible way, without grandiose philosophy and grounded in real boots-in-the-mud groundwork.<br /><br />Its a quick read, with undeniable conclusions that really might chance the way you think.
B003405MF6|5.0|I'm a guitarist -- and a pretty decent one, or so people tell me.  And for reasons that I'll never know, in my 35+ years of playing, I've never paid any attention whatsoever to Jeff Beck.  Huge fan of Blackmmore, Clapton, Gilmour, Hendrix, Howe, Hackett, Satriani, McLaughlin, Page -- the list goes on.  But for some incomprehensible reason, I've consistently ignored Beck's music -- until now.  I bought this album on the strength of reviews I'd read (and the fact that Beck appeared on the cover of Guitar Player a few weeks ago, forcing me to at least look at him, and read about his music).  I have tracked through this gem of a recording 3 or 4 times so far -- always from end to end, always without interruption.  It is, in my opinion, one of the most perfect and astonishingly moving collections of music I've ever heard.  It moves me to tears -- not just because of the beauty (and, in places, ferocity) of the music, but because of the simple, crushing realization that I will never, ever, play the guitar like Jeff Beck can.  I can emulate many, if not all, of the above named guitar heroes quite well.  I can play very fast, and very slowly.  But I will never, ever, come even close to being able to coax the sheer musical expression out of a single note the way Beck does -- and this makes me amazingly sad, and yet thankful for having been privileged to hear him do it.  The man is amazing, and this collection, ranging from tender to spellbinding to ferocious, is one of the most perfect recordings I've ever heard.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Friends of mine suggested this video, and I don't normally care for workout videos, but I have been looking for something that was quick and had strength training. I do triathlons and marathons, I am in good cardio shape, but really needed to add some strength training to my routine, I really like this video. I thought I would find Jillian Michaels annoying but she is motivating, and no nonsense, which I really like. I tried the workouts out for free \\"On Demand\\" first, and got hooked. Try them out, it's worth the 20 minutes.
B0035V35PI|4.0|I didn't know much about this one before going into it. I never saw the trailers, read the plot summary or even heard anything about it - the cover looked cool though! After I saw it pop up on sale, I took a peak at the reviews and saw that it did pretty well (generally high numbers) and I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I'm not too big a fan of traditional ninja movies. I prefer the more modern-day, action-packed hollywood movies where you just don't have to think, just sit back and let all sorts of ridiculous stuff happen for 2 hours and then forget all about it, and that's pretty much what this was. If you're looking for a story, you're better off skipping this one. If you're looking for some over the top slicing and dicing that will just make  you laugh because of how crazy, over the top ridiculous and unbelievable (not in a bad way) it is, this is your movie. It's sort of like the Crank or Kill Bill of Ninja movies. That alone should either make you want to order it right away or just completely pass on it.<br /><br />I'm never good at going into the plots of movies (especially odd ones like this), so I'll skip that here - many of the other reviews (or the Amazon description) will cover that part. I'll just go into the details of the Blu Ray.<br /><br />The movie itself, I give a 3.5: It's short & sweet, action packed and a fun movie to spend an hour and a half. What keeps it from getting a higher score is the whole investigation sub-story - I found it a bit boring and felt it took away from what could have otherwise been a very good action movie. Still enjoyable, but would've been a bit nicer without that whole part.<br /><br />Video was very good a nice treat on Blu-Ray (blacks were solid, colors were vibrant and I didn't notice any technical issues.<br /><br />Audio was also very good - a nice DTSHD 5.1 Master Audio track with lots of bang to it. It'll give your home theater a nice workout!<br /><br />Extras were decent with about an hour worth of documentaries, extra footage behind the scenes (some better than others). Fortunately all appeared to be in HD. My favorite though were the addition of a DVD and Digital Copy (same disc) - this is great for taking to a friends house (DVD) or copying to your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad (digital copy).<br /><br />Awesome audio, great video and a fun movie make this a recommendation from me! Not perfect, not for everyone, but if you just want to spend an hour and a half watching some over the top ninja action, this is what you want to pick up!ome better than others).

B001EO2UJK|1.0|Genesis (the Peter Gabriel period) may be the greatest band in the world, right after the Beatles (actually, to be fair, Genesis are probably sharing that honor with Led Zeppelin). Being a die hard fan, I couldn't wait to hear the latest and the greatest remixes of the material from that era. Having read many glowing reviews, I've decided to give it a try.    So I got the remixes, and, of course, the first thing I put on was \\"The Firth of Fifth\\" (their best song, bar none). Right away, with the first piano arpeggio, my heart broke. It sounded dreadful! There wasn't even a hint of the original beauty of the piano cascading those lavish, baroque-like waterfalls of sweet sound. Instead, the piano now sounds like some bleached elevator muzak.    The same holds true for the remaining tracks on their best album (\\"Selling England by the Pound\\"). It just isn't Genesis. The remixing crew managed, against all odds, to mix all the magic out of those timeless songs. What's left are just scattered bleached bones, drying up in the sun. Yes, you can now see the bones in very many details, but the flesh and the skin and the soul and the spirit are gone. Sad.    Deeply saddened, I couldn't continue listening to the rest of the box set. I only forced myself to sit through the \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" one time, and recoiled in horror. The sound is harsh, grating, horrendous. It probably sounds okay in the car, but on the home stereo, it is remiscent of the sound styrofoam makes when rubbed against a wet glass.    Why did they have to destroy this beautiful music?
B003CIG7AE|4.0|While I'm not a huge fan of Band of Horses (though I have their previous two albums), I came to this album curious about how their jump to a major label would (or wouldn't) affect their sound.  After a couple of listens to the new album, I was reaching for the first two to re-listen, but I'd have to say going to Columbia really didn't have an overall impact, probably because I understand this album was pretty much completed before they made the Columbia deal.  The first cut on the album, \\"Factory\\", begins with some nice strings and hints that BOH has expanded their sound.  The production does sound quite a bit slicker/polished than the first two albums, but overall, the songs are consistently engaging and this album flows well start-to-finish (I play it end to end each time I listen) .  This is a well paced album throughout, alternating up-tempo cuts with ballads, and has great harmonies (reminded me of the Jayhawks).   Over the last couple of weeks, I've found myself playing the album start-to-finish each time I listened to it - there's really not a bad cut on the cd.  At times, BOH sounds almost like a heavier version of Death Cab on this album (not a bad thing - Benjamin Bridwell has a somewhat higher-register voice, akin to DCFC's Ben Gibbard, at least to my ears) and the songs are instantly catchy, even on the first listen.
B003JSU2NU|4.0|I really love this CD and all the music on it.  I really love all the different types of music.  The only problem that I had was that I had already purchased the regular addition and thus had to give it to someone else so that I could get the bonus two songs.  I thought it was worth it in the end though and my friend loves the CD I gave her.
B0034GK7DM|2.0|I was very disappointed with this album. I thought there would better songs on it...hope his next album is better because he is a really good country singer.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Without a doubt a great looking movie and that's about its only redeeming quality.    This movie probably has one of the most ridiculous plots of anything of the Star Trek franchise, either tv or movie, obviously the producers have absolutely no concept of physics or time paradox.   Over use of special effects, totally pointless action sequences, incessant need to try and work everything from original Star Trek lore into a  two hour movie, just jumbled things even more.    If you are a die hard Trekkie, obviously this movie is a must, but if this is the future of Star Trek then the franchise really is doomed.   And what's with the tattooed Romulans, why is it that every bad guy today has to have tats, bit like the 80s, when every bad guy had dangly earing and mullet.    Honestly if you have the ability to go back in time and change things, why wouldn't you just prevent the future destruction of your planet, instead of destroying those responsible, 'makes no sense!\\"
030726999X|5.0|Finishing The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larsson was actually bittersweet.  I can't believe that I've finally come to the end of this magnificent trilogy!  Hornet's Nest was similar to book number two, The Girl Who Played with Fire.  Both were a little slow to start, but then really starting rolling through the end.  However, Hornet's Nest isn't a stand-alone book, and you shouldn't read it until you've read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire.  In fact, you probably should not read the rest of this review unless you've read the first two books.<br /><br />Hornet's Nest picks up right where The Girl Who Played with Fire left off.  Lisbeth Salander has been rushed to the hospital after being shot three times by her father, Alexander Zalachenko.  One of those wounds is to her brain, and her survival is in doubt.  Zalachenko is a former Soviet spy who defected to Sweden in the 1970s.  A super-secret group called \\"The Section\\" within the Swedish Security Police (Sapo) has been protecting Zalachenko for decades, stepping on the rights of Swedish citizens (especially Salander) and breaking laws along the way.  Zalachenko was attacked by Salander, and he is in the same hospital as his daughter, just two doors down the hall.  It is up to Salander to launch an aggressive campaign to free herself from the charges that are pending against her (murder, attempted murder, assault, etc.) and to try to keep herself from being locked away in a mental institution as she was in her teens.  But the computer-hacker extraordinare with a photographic memory is not allowed any visitors, phone calls, or electronic equipment.  It is up to Millennium journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, to orchestrate a strategy for Salander to help herself, while he investigates The Section.  The closer he gets to the truth, the more desperate The Section becomes and they're not opposed to killing those that get in their way.<br /><br />In Hornet's Nest, Larsson's strong women characters take center stage.  In addition to Lisbeth Salander, there is Annika Giannini (Blomkvist's sister and Salander's lawyer), Monica Figuerola (an investigator with the Swedish Security Police), Susanne Linder (a former policewoman who now works for a security firm), and Erika Berger (a magazine and then newspaper editor).  Although they all have their soft spots, they become warriors when dealing with wrong.  The also bring a new way of thinking when working in a mans' world.<br /><br />Two suggestions would have made Hornet's Nest even better.  First of all, Swedish names can be troubling, and Larsson compounds the problem by including lots of names that are similar.  Some of them include Nieminen and Niedermann, Malm and Malin, Eriksson and Erika, and Bjorck and Bjurman.  Also, a glossary of names of characters from the first two books would have helped immensely in book three.  It took awhile for me to remember who everyone was.  At least he does include two pages of notes in the back to explain some of the real political issues that were woven into the book.<br /><br />The sudden death of Larsson before his books were even published was a tragic loss for those of us who have come to love his works.  I understand that book four was over halfway finished at his death, with several more fleshed-out.  He originally intended that there would be ten books in this series.  Perhaps his long-time girlfriend will be interested in taking over his work, although I understand there are legal issues involved. I guess I'll have to content myself with now seeing them in movie-form.acters take center stage.

0307588335|1.0|I bought this book expecting to read what went on on the trading desks before the bankruptcy as someone who worked at lehman but not directly involved with the front office. But instead this book is 60% of author's autobiography up to landing a job at lehman (no offense to the author, but noone cares), 30% describes a couple of random winning trades while working at lehman (again noone cares). Only 10% of this book actually had something to do with the title - failure of lehman.  And the author was laid off one year before the bankruptcy, so the actual details I bought this book to read, was barely mentioned in a few pages, mostly look like a copy paste from the fortune/wsj article that was published. There was certainly nothing new nor inside look.     This book has a very misleading title in order to sell more copies, the actual content has VERY LITTLE to do with the failure of lehman or the days leading up to it. It was a waste of time, reading about this junior trader's ego and his childhood etc...i bought this book to read what went on in the trenches during the final days of lehman.
B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|Yes, the first two albums were very good. Yes, Perfect Symmetry wasn't perfect and veered off into new directions in ways that were at times jarring or unresolved. This ep, however, finds the band in full comfortable control of the 80s synth-pop influence, and as comfortable with a solid hook as ever. The rap additions to two songs don't jar, they sound contemporary and fresh, and the contrast between the rapper and the lead vocals makes each an embellishment for the other. Tigarah's guest vocals bring a hint of Pizzicato Five to the Yellow Magic Orchestra cover, but the whole album is like a tour through their influences and experiences as world travelers. The genius of Keane is how they can integrate those disparate sounds into a seamless, upbeat pop sheen. If the influential touchstones these days are more Prince and dance music than Coldplay and Radiohead, well, that's what we've got Muse for, right! This is a charming, if a bit inconsequential, album of polished Euro-pop.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|When the original TOY STORY debuted in theatres in 1995, I sat awe struck at the brilliance of the opening scene and how they did the lighting from the bedroom window and the shine of the wood floors. The shadows and the colors were unbelievable. Then, the toys came to life when the people weren't looking and I knew I was watching a gem of long lasting origin.<br /><br />It didn't take long for the brilliance of the animators and the writers to bring 'toys' to life, not only on screen, but in our minds and hearts. We could feel their plite. They had a seemingly simple life: be toys, love their owners and do whatever it took to continue to be Andy's toys. We can all relate. We've all had to get rid of toys, or replaced toys with new ones, or watched Mom put our favorite toys in a garage sale, or inevitably outgrew toys to the point that if we were still playing with them... we'd be made fun of.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 comes full circle and brings out emotions that I challenge any film out there with human actors to top. The toys are plain and simple... LOVE. That's their sole purpose in life. To Love and to be loved. A valuable lesson to all of us. So, as they once again try to find out a way to continue to be Andy's toys, Pixar not only duplicates the heart and soul of the first 2 movies, but surpasses. Somewhere along the line, the characters of Toy Story became real to us.<br /><br />As we all relate to reaching out for someone to love and to be loved in return, it's the toys soul purpose and that makes Toy Story 3 all the more poigniant. 5 stars doesn't give Toy Story 3 justice. It has it all. Where most movies are trying not to be a waste of time, TOY STORY 3 and its predecessor's will be timeless. Toy Story 3 will be nominated for best picture this year and it may even be the first animated film to win. It's that good.
6303921248|5.0|I love this version of Pride and Prejudice.  My office only has VHS, so I can work and watch my favorite movie at the same time.  The only setback is the tapes don't run very long, so I am constantly changing them.
0060254920|5.0|\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" is a book I read to my now-39 year old son, Kyle, when he was a child. He still remembers this as his favorite childhood book. We were delighted to see on Amazon that it is still in print. I ordered the book to give to his son, Ezra, so his Dad can continue the family tradition.
1932100660|3.0|I read most of this  book over the past weekend and while I found many of Campbell's points to be persuasive, I was puzzled by some data anomalies that he did not explain.  For example, in several charts documenting consumption of animal protein and dairy, the French were rather high on consumption of those foods but did not, according to Campbell's data, suffer as much from the \\"diseases of affluence\\" Campbell is addressing.  Also, while the Japanese state of health was praised at several points, Campbell never addresses high levels of fish consumption in the Japanese diet.  Based only on the data he presented (I am not a nutritional scientist), the case does not seem to be so cut and dried as he presents it.  That bothered me.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Having seen this film about 10 times in the last week, I just had to review it.  Both my 9 year old granddaughter and her 2 year old sister are loving this film.  But the 2 year old is the one who is insisting on seeing it over and over.<br /><br />Friendship, caring, sharing and so many other good qualities are emphasized in the movie.  There is even a large focus on a senior center and the relationship between a small boy and the elders, all done with such emphasis on good manners and love.  Granted a fish does not turn into a little girl but that bit of magic is overpowered by the fabulous mothering skills of Souski's mother who just tucks that little girl into her love and caring of her son and grows her family.<br /><br />If you want a good film which teaches great values with so much ease, then this is a film you need to show your preschoolers.  The older kids will enjoy it and you can watch too and enjoy it (at least the first 5 or so times) but the real value comes with the little ones who can learn so much about how to deal with other people from this film.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|When I first put the triggers on the ps3 controller, I said to myself WOW makes the controller much more comfortable, but as soon as I start playing with it, they immediately broke off. Then I said.. no big deal.... I'll just use some real strong super glue to keep them from breaking off and that's exactly what I did. I used \\"Gorilla Glue\\" super glue. There are different kinds of gorilla glue, but I used the super glue kind with the blue stripe on the label because super glue works best on plastic. I let it dry for 24 hrs. for max strength and you'll see they won't ever break off. I also recommend \\"Sticky Ass Glue\\", which is multi-purpose and even stronger than gorilla glue, but either one will bond the triggers great on the ps3 controller.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|I listened to this album on my way to Bonnaroo a week and a half ago; I figured it was exactly the kind of music to get me in the mood for the festival.  Under normal circumstances (i.e., listening at my computer, on my stereo, during my commute, or while at work), I probably wouldn't have liked this album as much as I did.  But I think driving through the Appalachian mountains in a huge RV, on the way to Magical Hippie Land, made me extra-receptive to alternative/\\"Southern\\" rock with obvious country influences.  I really enjoyed this album, as did the other passengers in the RV; we enjoyed it so much that we listened to it twice.<br /><br />Infinite Arms tends to stroll along at a relaxed pace.  BOH's members are very talented and sing/play from their hearts, and it comes through on this album, which feels like a great mix of Indie + Americana.  It's like that awesome satchel you just found at the thrift store that you know in your heart was destined for your possession.  BOH's sound on Infinite Arms reminds me of My Morning Jacket and The Shins.  The harmonies are reminiscent of CSNY; singer Ben Bridwell sounds, to me, a lot like Neil Young.  And lastly -- this is a strange comparison, I admit -- many songs reminded me of some of the Doobie Brothers' early 1970s stuff, like South City Midnight Lady and Black Water, but with less funk and overall edge.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed the tracks Complements, Laredo (probably the most \\"catchy\\" song on the album, one that will stay in your head), Blue Beard (a ballad with a beautiful melody), Dilly (the RV's collective favorite, easily the most upbeat song on the album), Older, and NW Apt.<br /><br />Take a listen to the MP3 tracks; although only 30-second clips, they're a good representation of the album's flow and pace.  If you like what you hear, you'll enjoy this album.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the artists I mentioned above (MMJ, The Shins, CSNY, early Doobies) and is looking for a great laid-back album.
0439023491|5.0|This series is terrific, and this book is even better than the first!I can hardly wait for the third, MockingJay, to come out. Collins has created a complicated and dangerous future with a love triangle worthy of the Twilight series. She has a gift for setting up impossible to resolve situations, and then finding a way to resolve them. Very well written--a real page turner!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|First I thought : Well another album like \\"Black Rain\\" . That´s not true, this is the greatest album since \\"No More Tears\\", full of powerful songs, even the more sweetest songs are great. Epic Album... The album of the year so far.
B003K025V4|2.0|What is this? Miley at a rave? I do not like this new record at all. The only track I would listen to is track twelve.
B00009P1MP|4.0|In the UK the 1971 single American Pie flew to the top of the charts where it stayed for many weeks and enjoyed massive radio airplay.  It's a landmark song which continues to sound fresh and relvant even today.  This reissue contains the lyrics, some of which I had not been able to deciper despite hearing it countless times.  The album itself, to me at least, does not follow the title track's \\"hit you in the eye effect\\", with far too much introspective stuff and the depressing The Grave is a definite downer.  Even the second single, Vincent, is hardly a bundle of fun.  There is a far lighter song, the excellent Everybody Loves Me, Baby, which is rather a shock after all the low mood songs.   I do like Babylon, which is based on Psalm 137, it really blows away Boney M's version.  The bonus tracks are from 1992 and are no way essential additions to this varied work.
B001EOOQEM|3.0|This album simply is not as good as the Black Sabbath with Ozzy. This music is more predictable and less omninous. I thought it sounded like a cross between Uriah Heep and Deep Purple. Dio just does not instill that sense of dread and doom that Ozzy did.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I just completed Day 30 of the 30 Day Shred. I did it every day, for the complete 30 days.    Let me tell you: It was worth it! I had put on about 10 lbs that I really wanted to lose... which doesn't sound like much, but when you're only 5' tall, 10 lbs REALLY makes a difference.     I didn't take measurements, (I was too fed up with myself,) but I went from a size 7 back down to my regular size 2.     I feel so much better, and so proud for completing the 30 Day Shred. I'm way more toned, happier, and no longer hiding in baggy clothes.     I would recommend this DVD to EVERYONE!!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|First, after just the pilot I had mixed feelings. I thought the show was at times very witty and funny, but often felt awkward and as if I did not know what direction it wanted to go in. It felt a bit unsure of itself and lost. And these feeling really lingered on, with a lot of changing elements till about the Christmas episode, where the show finally started to feel like it understood itself and really started to develop.<br /><br />The humor of the show is great. It is important that the show has the ability to make fun of itself. Especially since it spends a lot of it's time making fun of other shows and movies. A lot of my favorite humor is around Abed's character. Either through his narration, or even his spoken words in the group, he often plays well off of the going ons of the group and relates them to movies, TV shows, and general stereotypical sitcom situations in general. And this is where the show does its best job at creating funny episodes. When they are really able to capture and play off of all of the generic storylines of TV shows, the show has a very good track record of creating excellent episodes.<br /><br />The crucial part of this, is that even though a lot of the humor is making fun of the normal plots of TV shows, the show itself is still able to have those storylines and still not feel too trite. For example, the romantic interest of Jeff and Britta feels real and even though at times it is used as a vehicle for humor, it still has heart itself. Without these elements (like Abed and Troy's bromance also), the show would fall apart, and it is also a pretty tough balance to find, though it seems like Community did not seem to have all that much problem.<br /><br />I will interject with a few negative feelings I had from this freshman season. First, I do not really like Pierce's character all that much. I think that while at times his characterization in the show, of being more or less the older guy still trying to fit in and be hip, just does not find its mark. He often is just not funny, in the sense that I understand a lot of his jokes are supposed to be funny because of their comparison with the rest of the group, but this style of humor gets old fast. And I also thought that the episode with Jack Black (Investigative Journalism) was bar far my least favorite episode. I thought the idea of the episode, that he was supposed to be the guest star that got in the episode and broke the normal ebb and flow of the show, was really a funny idea. But I thought they took it a step to far, and like a lot of Jack Black humor, was just flat and not funny.<br /><br />But ending the cynicism, there were a few episodes I really liked. For example the Halloween episode, the Christmas Episode, the April Fools episode, and in particular, the Action movie episode (Modern Warfare). The last of which, being one of the best episodes of a comedy show I have seen in a long time. The movie cliches and references all worked well, and just created a fun episode. The Jeff/Britta stuff also worked well in this episode, especially with Abed's commentary and realization that something has changed by the end of the episode.;ÿO:ÿ[CÿeK&uuml;&Ograve;±ten is just not funny, in the sense that I understand a lot of his jokes are supposed to be funny because of their comparison with the rest of the group, but this style of humor gets old fast.

0061998494|5.0|This book was an absolute delight. I thought I like Craig Furguson before, I just love him now that I have felt like I've seen into his soul!    This story is absolutely moving, touching and hilarious. I feel like as an American, who have tendencies to be a bit mentally isolated, this book helped open my eyes even more on how blessed we are to be Americans.    Anyone who has gone through hard times (  haven't we all? ) will find solace and strength is this story.     A must read.
0142410373|5.0|Matilda, by Roald Dahl<br /><br />\\"Matilda\\" may be my ultimate favorite of Roald Dahl's books, but that's probably because I'm a voracious reader, just like the title character.<br /><br />Matilda is an oddity in her household - she prefers books to television - but aside from that, her parents don't really like her. They treat her nastily, and as a child, she doesn't have many options for revenge. But as with all Dahl books, she takes matters into her own hands, using her amazing intelligence to pull some creative pranks on her parents.<br /><br />But Matilda's brain power really comes in when she wants to rescue Miss Honey, her school teacher, from a truly despicable situation. If you haven't read the book I won't spoil it. It's a very fun and creative story.<br /><br />The illustrations by Quentin Blake are the icing on the cake for me in \\"Matilda;\\" normally I don't look much at pictures, but I rather like all of the illustrator's images. They add to Dahl's already excellent book.<br /><br />5/5.

0142410314|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by Roald Dahl<br /><br />Charlie Bucket's story touched my heart the first time I read \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" when I was much younger. I still like to pull it out from time to time and relive the magic of Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate creations, and the humor of the four nasty children who got what they deserved.<br /><br />Charlie is a poor child, and lives with his four grandparents and parents in a little ramshackle house. The family barely has enough money to buy food, and survive mostly on cabbage. Mr. Bucket, Charlie's father, works screwing toothpaste caps on full tubes. The only bright spot in their lives are Grandpa Joe's stories, particularly the ones about the mysterious Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Wonka's factory has been closed to the public for over a decade, but when he puts five Golden Tickets in candy bars, five lucky children have the chance to enter the factory, as well as win a lifetime supply of goodies. Charlie's desperate for a ticket, but his family can only afford one candy bar a year, and he isn't lucky. But as readers of Dahl's works know, good children get their due, and Charlie and Grandpa Joe find a Golden Ticket...<br /><br />What can I say about \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?\\" It's one of my favorite of the author's works, and I tend to reread it every few years. If you've never read anything by Roald Dahl, this book is a great place to start.<br /><br />5/5.
0385342039|1.0|I think Sophie Kinsella is a very talented and entertaining writer and I am a huge fan.  However, I did not care for this book at all.  I read and accept ficiton for what it is and do so more willingly with chick lit.  While reading such tales, I easily accept that of course the girl will win the guy in the end and love the fact that you can shop without money, mess up at work and be just a tad too chubby and still come out ahead.  I believe in that.  I don't believe in ghosts.  Granted, I only read 20 pages because I wasn't into the premise, I think she can and does do better than this book.

Buy Seafarers also - its the best expansion (cities and knights also really good). They're all good.

B001ECQ4AS|5.0|Supernatural Season One on Blu-Ray<br />22 Episodes on 4 Discs being released June 15, 2010<br /><br />\\"Supernatural\\" the series begins with the origin story of young Dean and Sam's mother's mysterious death and their father's obsession with solving it by hunting for supernatural activity. Years later when their father disappears, they take up his journal in hopes of finding him and some answers but end up taking up where he left off solving the mysterious of the paranormal.<br /><br />The series has all the fun and creepiness of \\"The X-Files\\" minus romantic tension (with a substitution of sibling rivalry) and the absence of bureaucracy and Cigarette Smoking Man. Dean and Sam hit the road with reckless abandon drifting from place to place surviving on money they make hustling people at pool and poker so they can continue the hunt for answers.<br /><br />Sam (Jared Padalecki) left his college to go on this road trip with his brother after a mysterious incident with his girlfriend passing the exact same way as his mother and being driven into the same obsession as his father (Jeffery Dean Morgan). Dean (Jensen Ackles) is an obedient son with a bit of swagger whose quest in the supernatural has been ongoing his entire life. In this formula, Sam is Luke Skywalker and Dean is Han Solo and their classic muscle car is the Millennium Falcon. Their relationship is constantly being tested through these ghost hunts and the buddy road trip vibe serves the series well.<br /><br />Padalecki and Ackles have an easy going relationship and chemistry that ties each individual episode together. Each episode is like a mini-movie, but the fluctuations of their interactions create the overall arc of the tension in their family and search for their father and their mother's killer.<br /><br />The urban legends are fantastic with everything from Bloody Mary to the man with the hook that kills the boyfriend, to the ghost woman getting picked up on the side of the road wanting to go home, to a freaky scarecrow god in a field!

B003KUSUG8|1.0|Well, I wonder what exactly Eminem Recovered from? Because he's still talking about taking drugs, degrading women, pissed at the world, making fun of people, and throwing a whole bunch of nursery rhyme cuss words around every other line. Now, first of all, I DO think Eminem has talent don't get me wrong. I think he's got lyrical skills and his flow can be close to unmatched, however, I've been waiting for him to mature as an artist forever but he can't. He's still that angry confused scared little boy. And it's the image he is forced to put out because he's a corporate puppet, and it sucks but the only way Eminem will ever stay around is to talk about the same negative garbage he's been talking about since he first came out. I'm not hating on Em man, I think he's hating on himself by not coming out with any songs that have positive messages to them. The song \\"Not Afraid\\" sounds like a positive song until you listen to the lyrics! Yeah follow this guy that talks about dropping ex and f*&king for christmas, great role model to follow. I don't know man, maybe I just changed with time and got smart enough to see through this crap. Anyway, if your buying this album looking for the same Eminem you always loved...you'll like it, maybe even love it. But...if you buy this album thinking you're going to hear something different from him....well then he gotcha! Ohhh yeah if you want to spend your money wisely on an album right now you need to cop Nas & Damian Marley-Distant Relatives, best hip hop album out right now!!!Now I'm off to go check out that new Roots cd, peace mayne!
B003HARV4S|4.0|The Illusionist<br />Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack<br /><br />Newly released on Blu-Ray on June 8th, \\"The Illusionist\\" was originally released in 2006 and was written and directed by Neil Burger based on the short story, \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\" written by Steven Millhauser. Edward Norton plays the great illusionist, Eisenheim who finds his childhood love, Sophie played by Jessica Biel is engaged to Crown Prince Leopold played by Rufus Sewell. The city's Chief Inspector Uhl and the prince become obsessed with Eisenheim's association with Sophie and how his illusions are done until a mysterious crime takes place and a major investigation begins.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing in this movie and the Blu-Ray quality only adds to the magic. The acting is pretty top-notch bringing American, English, and German actors all towards a soft Viennese accent. Edward Norton is wonderfully guarded and mysterious throughout the film and learned some of the hand trickery from actual magicians. Paul Giamatti is characteristically gruff, but at times difficult to understand and awkward. His eyes say volumes about what his lines don't reveal. Jessica Biel is beautiful and keeps it simple which seems to be the best way to play it in this case. This was one of her first roles outside the norm of popular romantic comedy and television fare. Rufus Sewell has an admirable performance as the villain, all of whose lines could be taken as guilty or innocent, but he could have been a little more menacing or crazy. The story is like a well-played chess game with Eisenheim always a few steps ahead of his pursuers and a very enjoyable ride.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The bonus features are ONLY on the DVD, not the Blu-Ray disc. They include feature length commentary with writer/director Niel Burger, the Making of The Illusionist, and Jessica Biel on the Illusionist. The commentary by Burger is very interesting since he explains how each illusion would be done and points out some historical facts about the shooting location and its connections to Archduke Ferdinand whose death began World War I.<br /><br />The making of featurette is less than four minutes long and it is just a series of the main actors explaining their characters and the plot. The Jessica Biel segment has the same interviews as in the \\"making of\\" featurette with a few more seconds of her saying she sought out the film since it was the next type of project she wanted to do and lasts less than two minutes.<br /><br />This combo allows you to get what is already available on DVD with no further extras, except a Blu-Ray disc with fantastic picture to make the illusions even more illusion-y!location and its connections to Archduke Ferdinand whose death began World War I.

B003HLM2QO|2.0|Sure we all want to love the new studio album from the Prince of Darkness, but you just can't fool yourself into believing that this is a good album. The riffs are generic, the solos are short and bland, the vocals are in very limited range, and the whole album is just mediocre. I'm not saying it's a total loss, Ozzy doesn't really make any 'bad' albums, but I would definitely put this at the bottom of the list.<br />  I didn't mind Ozzy replacing Zakk, despite being the Zakk fan I am, but I thought Ozzy could use some fresh blood on guitar. There's no doubt Gus G is a talented guitarist, but there's something lacking I can't quite put my finger on. It is said that Gus didn't write any of the songs on Scream so hopefully on the next album, he will be able to take some creative freedom and give us something unique, because this album just sounds like a much lesser Black Rain album. We love Ozzy, but this album is at the bottom of the barrel :-/
B002ZG982S|1.0|\\"Jonah Hex\\" was directed by Jimmy Hayward who was a director and actor for \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\" and clearly was the right choice for the job (*insert sarcasm here*). Josh Brolin stars as Jonah Hex, a branded ex-Confederate Soldier turned bounty hunter on a path for vengeance against Quentin Turnbull played by John Malkovich, the man who murdered his wife and child.<br /><br />Unfamiliar with the comic book, I thought I was going to be getting more of a lone gunslinger wild west tale, but instead got a warped CGI explosion heavy, shoddy hand-to-hand combat action flick in South Carolina. Were there ever deserts in South Carolina?<br /><br />My first instinct was that this film was pretty inconsistent/uneven, but that would have to imply that parts were good and parts were bad and for the life of me, I can't think of any parts that were good.<br /><br />When the tagline reads \\"Revenge is Ugly\\", they weren't kidding. Brolin's face is so ugly along with his personality that it is almost impossible to cheer for him. He's gruff and maybe it is the challenge of working with the side of his mouth clenched from the deformity, but his half-hearted quips never pay off. You never get the impression that he actually likes or cares about Megan Fox or her character and all of their scenes have the chilly chemistry of \\"Let's get this over with.\\"<br /><br />Megan Fox as Lilah right from the start is pretty unlikable. Her character is a hypocrite chasing off some John who wants her to run away with him to the big city only to suggest to Jonah Hex that he do the same with her. Megan Fox's body looks good in a dress and we all know she is a striking young lady even in the all-natural look she was sporting cosmetics-wise, but someone came up with the horrible idea to give her a blurry Barbara Walters filter in EVERY shot to ease off some of that high definition detail that might expose a reality where she has pores *gasp*. It is super distracting and suggests her character ought to have angel wings or something when her attitude and morals couldn't be farther away. Her accent is painful and remember while watching this that in the movie world, you have multiple takes to choose from when you make the final cut so the line delivery you hear here is the best the director got out of her. Wow. Bad choice all around to cast her because looks-wise you'd think it would work, but instead of making her real and gritty and consistent with the rest of the film, they went with the weird filter choice and everything else about her character and acting is a disaster. By the time she tries to do some fighting of her own at the end, it's too late, we already hate her. \\"Jennifer's Body\\" = YES, \\"Jonah Hex\\" = NO.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender whom I loved in \\"Fish Tank\\" and \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is thrown into a funky henchman with a neck tattoo whom from his accent I can only guess is...Irish?? Accents are all over the place in this film, but this one and this character takes the cake for weirdness. He seems to be a jaunty assassin that enjoys his task of finishing Jonah Hex so much that he keeps getting distracted and letting the man get away. His final fight scene ends very anticlimactically with a result that seems VERY PG13 for what was supposed to have happened to him. Maybe they should have gone big or gone home with an R rating to boost up the violence to a level that would more properly express the grittiness of tone throughout.<br /><br />John Malkovich uses flat proper annunciation to be a villain once more as is his trademark. Turnbull is seeking out weapons of mass destruction to use against a centennial celebration not for any specific revenge, but just to blow stuff up apparently. Faking his own death got Hex off the trail, but once Turnbull is out and about causing a ruckus again, the U.S. Military comes crawling back to Jonah Hex, the only man they believe can stop him with promises of a blanket pardon if he succeeds. Being flat and emotionless usually works in rival to a passionate hero, but when both protagonist and antagonist come off as one-note, the whole vengeance plot feels bland and pointless.<br /><br />Probably the coolest moments of the movie are when Jonah Hex reanimates dead people, but that is mostly on the CGI end and not the acting at all.<br /><br />\\"Jonah Hex\\" is a little painful and ugly from start to finish. A little jumpy, filled with flashbacks and a recurring vengeance dream that seems nonsensical and like it should have been cut altogether. Better to steer clear of this one, you'd be better off with an action-comedy like \\"The A-Team\\" or \\"Knight and Day\\" shockingly.en both protagonist and antagonist come off as one-note, the whole vengeance plot feels bland and pointless.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|If your one of those people who are easily ammused by pretty colors and flashy pictures then Im sure you'll love this movie. But if you're more into thinking and like a good story to go with all that action and CGI you'll be a little dissapointed here. The plot (if you can call it that) is full of social commentary and historical satire that comes off extremly cheesey and very predictable, but the sprcial effects and Computer Animation are very well done and look amazing. But you can say the same for \\"Cars\\" or \\"Finding Nemo\\" but with those films you'll get a better written storylines.

B003JJA59K|3.0|I've never read the book, and honestly don't care to. I do however watch movies... and that's what this review is going to be about.<br /><br />First off \\"The Road\\" had all the right elements but they somehow had all the wrong ones too.<br /><br /> The movie is mainly about a man and his son who are traveling on their last hope. The man knows that where ever he goes there will be nothing, and  I'm quite sure the boy does too. However, they decide to believe in the lie that there is hope beyond the horizon.<br /><br />Watching the movie you realize that they travel this \\"road\\" because it's what keeps them alive. The \\"hope\\" or as they call it in the film the \\"fire\\" that they carry will lead them on. The film has this surreal Planet Of The Apes vibe going on. Something devastating has happened to the planet and yet it remains a complete mystery as to what or how.<br /><br />Most of the movie revolves around the relationship of the Father and his daughter... umm er I mean Son. The Father character is a bit naive or should I say he is cautiously naive. He takes all the precautions to avoid potential danger yet he still ends up heading right into it. It also doesn't help that his goal is to get his Son (might as well had been his daughter) to become more independent so that he could continue to survive in his absence.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this idea is that the Son who is about 11 acts more like a 4 year old girl. Whining,crying,hanging on to his father, throwing tantrums, etc.etc. This kid wouldn't make it 2minutes without being eaten if his father wasn't around. The role of the boy would of made more sense if he was a girl the way the Father treated him. The actor they got for the role was extremely annoying! If he wasn't whining he was crying and if he wasn't crying he was whining. If the kid was 3 or 4 understandable... but the kid was about 11-12.<br /><br />Another thing about the movie is that absolutely no one seems to have any will to survive. They are all just waiting to die and buying their time. (possible spoiler) Like when the Fathers wife just decides she would rather die than live because it's too stressful for her...so she just walks outside to die. What was that about? Why didn't the father just literally slap some sense into her. Throughout the entire movie it's just talking about suicide and walking from point A to point B.<br /><br />The story has some action sequences and interesting moments... but it has no climax. It just them walking around and running into dangerous situations occasionally. The more interesting parts of the movie are watching the cannibals and all their scenes. Makes you think how awesome the movie could have been if it was about them instead.<br /><br />Overall this movie is okay if you can put up with a whiny boy girl.r time.

0385732554|5.0|This is an extremely powerful little book that invokes so many emotions and demands contemplation.  I was engaged from the beginning by the dystopian society and with Jonas's narrative.  Upon his selection as the next Receiver, he is forced to face some revolutionary concepts as the Giver transfers memories to Jonas.  The relationship that develops between the Giver and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; is tender and paternal, allowing Jonas to experience love for the first time.  As Jonas comes to terms with his new position in the community and learns the realities of maintaining this harmonious lifestyle, I could completely sympathize with his disenchantment and his impending loneliness.  I was very impressed by the simplicity of the story and its ability to affect me in so many ways.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminem's new album \\"Recovery\\" is a real return to Em's awesome lyrical form.  That's the main thing I took from this album.  He's lyrically untouchable, having taking his mic skills to a whole new level here.  His energy is astounding and you can tell that he really worked hard on this record.<br /><br />I've read some poor critical reviews of \\"Recovery\\".  Most of them are sharply criticizing the production techniques used on this album, as they are far different than they ever have been on any Eminem album.  While it's true that the album's hooks are kinda poppy, I think that the experimentation on the record works fantastically with Em's new found attitude and strength. All of those poor reviews I read sounded like they were really nit-picking for something to b*tch about, as critics tend to do by definition.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is Eminem's best quality album since \\"The Eminem Show\\".  The rhyming skills exhibited by Em are just the best they have been in a long time. I think old-school fans will be pleased and that Eminem will continue to make plenty of new fans with this album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks:<br />- \\"Cold Wind Blows\\" - solid album opener and hilariously explicit. 10/10.<br /><br />- \\"Talkin' 2 Myself (featuring Kobe)\\" - really cool production on this track. 9/10.<br /><br />- \\"Won't Back Down (featuring Pink)\\" - don't be afraid of the fact that Pink is on this track. The song works really well with an awesome beat and Em tears it apart. 8/10.<br /><br />- \\"No Love (featuring Lil Wayne)\\" - Weezy and Em, what more can you say? 9/10.<br /><br />- \\"25 to Life\\" - One of the most personal tracks on the album lyrically. Cool hook, too. 9/10.<br /><br />-\\"You're Never Over\\" - Em finally gets to say a proper good-bye rhyme to Proof. 9/10.<br /><br />This album also contains 2 #1 singles with \\"Not Afraid\\" and \\"Love the Way You Lie (featuring Rihanna)\\", However, those tracks are my least favorite tracks on the album, even though a lot of people would list those 2 songs as some of their favorites. I think the rest of the album is superior to those 2 hits.<br /><br />Well, I hope that helps, I would highly recommend this album, 4.5 stars.r to those 2 hits.   Well, I hope that helps, I would highly recommend this album, 4.5 stars.
0545123275|5.0|Grace and Sam have been watching each other for years. Ever since Sam saved Grace. Grace watched Sam in the winter and fell in love with his yellow eyes. But Grace was human and in her eyes, Sam was just a wolf. But, Sam is more than just a wolf, he is a werewolf but Grace doesn't find out until it is almost too late. Sam was running out of summers. And, now that Grace knows Sam as a human, it might be too late for the two of them.<br /><br />Shiver is a great love story, a bit reminiscent of Twilight in some ways. So, if you like Twilight you will like this book. But, unlike Bella, I feel Grace is more relatable and not as crazy love stricken as Bella in Twilight. Grace knows she only has a little bit of time to spend with Sam so she absorbs everything she can but is still smart about it.<br /><br />This book, I believe, is a great page turner. I wanted to know what would happen with Grace and Sam. What would happen to Jake and what would happen to all the other wolves. The story does get sad at the end and I almost had some tears. I don't want to give to much away but this is a really good book. Bunch of people recommended this book to me and I would recommend this book as well.
B00275EHJG|5.0|TOY STORY 3 is an awesome movie!  Hilarious & heartbreaking.  Witty & wise.  A must-see.    That opening paragraph ought to be enough, but in case you need more, I'll try.  Honestly, though, it is a bit tough, because this movie delighted me on a much more personal and visceral level than most.  If you were a fan of the first two films (and I am HUGE fan), then TOY STORY 3 is a near perfect culmination and summation of both the surface stories of these beloved characters and the deeper themes of friendship, responsibility, aging, learning  & growing that the first films were.    The toys of TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 are much older now.  Of course, they haven't really changed...they are always toys.  But their owner, Andy, is now just days from leaving for college, and he's packing up his room.  The toys are understandably very concerned:  will they go with Andy to college (highly unlikely), will they be consigned to the attic (not great, but there's always the hope that one day Andy will share his toys with his own children) or will they be consigned to the curbside garbage?  Through a series of misunderstandings, most of the toys end up being donated to a nearby Daycare Center, where they join a motley crew of other donated toys.  (And in the film's most inspired addition, they meet Ken...who is perfectly conceived.  He's a man, but he's meant to be a girl's toy, so his attitude is decidedly \\"clothing/fashion friendly\\".)  And all is not as it seems at this daycare center, from evil toys who run the nights like a less-than-benevolent dictatorship to the very young kids whose enjoyment of toys consist of bashing them on the floor.  Our poor friends are subjected to horrific abuse...and it's up to Woody, the original hero, voiced by Tom Hanks, to save them.    (You'll notice I'm not spending a lot of time describing the toys.  Honestly, if you don't know them already, don't see TOY STORY 3 until you've enjoyed the other two.  It is absolutely essential that you know these characters already, because the filmmakers sure assume that you do.)    The film is packed full of hilarious scenes (the \\"escape from prison\\" scene has the best Mr. Potato Head gag possible) and witty conceits (the aforementioned Ken, a dinosaur with a Facebook account, etc.)  As with the prior films, it has delightfully clever \\"jokes only adults will get\\" but as opposed to the SHREK movies, for example, it's tone is always one of childlike wonder.  TOY STORY 3 plays to an audience of kids...and yes, it's a total cliché...it plays to the kid in all of us.  In fact, to get the full emotional resonance of these films, you MUST be an adult.      Once all the action and plot is nearly resolved, the film circles back to the issue that's been roiling underneath since the beginning of the film (and possibly even since the beginning of the series)...what happens to the devoted toys when their master outgrows them.  The final 10 minutes or so of the film will devastate you.  In a good way...but nonetheless, be prepared with extra tissue.  You get a good, old-fashioned wallow in tear-jerking...and even though a nitpicker could argue that no college bound student could possibly act in quite the way Andy does, you just embrace it anyway and let the feelings wash over you.    It's hard for me to imagine being more satisfied with the conclusion of such a beloved series.  To say \\"Pixar has done it again\\" is yet another cliché.  But it's more true than ever.
0756405890|5.0|I am not a fantasy fan at all.  Rarely read them but I somehow picked up this book on a whim.  Something about the title must have caught my eye.  I read it and loved it.  It grabbed me completely.  I was swept up in the tale and couldn't get through it fast enough.  I really tried to put it down so I could sleep, go to work, brush my teeth but I was completely absorbed with the next page and the next.  If I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it.  When I got to the end of this book I was devastated to find the story was not finished and this, in fact, was a three book series with no signs of the next installment in stores for years.  I feel like a crack addict with my drug taken away!
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|This is a very big P&S camera case.  It will probably fit the biggest P&S cameras.  The dimensions in the description are the internal dimensions.  The external seams and heavy padding give the case some huge external dimensions:  6\\"x4\\"x2.5\\".  This thing won't fit in your pocket.<br /><br />The top flap and the belt loop are secured by pieces of generic velcro.  They seem fairly secure when new, but will they get too weak with use?  Definitely keep an eye on those if you don't want your camera to go flying.<br /><br />Construction quality is not as good as similar cases from LowePro or Kata, but it is a good value at $6, which is half what the name brands cost.
B003FMTZOM|1.0|A total dissapointment. Why are established artists copying Lady GaGa??? I was expecting more of X-Tina, but this one is totally flushable. You can do better than this!!!! One listen was enough.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|these headphones are very good in my opinion.  I had a very minor issue wiht static only when the plug that conects to the 360 controller was moved, however that has stopped so i think it may have beensome residue on the plug?  very clear sounds and good bass.  i use these for MW2 and they are awesome, i can tell which direction things are coming from people/and weapon fire.  they have been used for 15 plus hours already and the batteries they came with are still going strong, but i have two sets of rechargeables to use ready to go.  easy to connect, plus just FYI you can have the hdmi stream sound to your tv/receiver and use the optical from the 360 for just this headphone setup.  i do also use the A/V dongle for the optical http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S5CCF2/ref=oss_product. the only thing i can say that i would change about this product is the power button is located on the back near the bottom, if it was on the top or front it would be easier to use. one other thing is after a few hours of gaming you may notice the extra weight and have a sore neck not very sore just a slight annoyance, however the headphone are very light, i actually thought they would be heavier then they are.  i think it is just not being use to having headphones on. sound quality is very good.  i would buy these again, very happy with them.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|When Encore was released, I was expecting a classic. He already released three classics in a row so why would it stop there? However, I bought it and was never so let down in my life. Sure there were some great songs on the album such as Like Toy Soldiers, Mosh, Mockingbird, Crazy In Love, and Spend Some Time, but then you have the rest of the album. When Relapse first came out I loved it. Relapse was a good album for what it was but I quickly realized how low the replay value was after a couple months. One year later, there's only a few songs I still listen to. Deja Vu being one of them and it's still the best song he's made since his return. However, every song on this album is good. I'll just let Eminem speak for me. \\"Them last two albums didn't count. Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out.\\"  After the release of Relapse, Eminem started putting out great track after great track. Microphone, Forever, Psycho, Drop the World, Airplanes Part II, and Despicable made me have no doubt in my mind that Recovery would be better than Relapse. However, I had no idea it would be an album that's as good as The Eminem Show. This is without a doubt Eminem's fourth classic. Let me just point out that I think his first two albums are his best. Not Afraid was the first single and was a great choice. The reason why is because this is the track where he actually apologized to the fans for Relapse and confirmed that he dropped the accents. Also, it was the first time Eminem didn't have a poppy first single which was a good sign. Something notable about this album is there are no skits. This is a major plus for me because I always hated skipping those. He covers so much more on this album than he did on Relapse. He talks about how he almost dissed Lil Wayne because he was jealous of him. He even completely dismisses his last two albums. These are the kinds of things I've been wanting to hear from Eminem. He was always really open on his first three albums and that's what he's being here. He also finally addresses Proof and gives his opinion on what people were saying about the night he was killed. Proof even gets his own tribute song, You're Never Over, which is surprisingly very upbeat. The line \\"And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life\\" sums it up perfectly. Proof didn't even get a mention on Relapse except in the booklet. He said he tried writing a song for Proof but none were good enough. That says a lot about how much he's recovered since Relapse. He even mentions Kim in a positive way saying he still loves her and would do anything for her. He's matured a lot since his first album and it really shows here. These are the most notable things he covers, but not even close to all of the things. He has some amazing concepts on this album. As for what my favorite and least favorite songs are, I can't pick. It's the most consistent album he's ever made. Even the less serious songs like W.T.P. and So Bad I love. If you like Eminem's first three albums I highly recommend you buy this album. Eminem deserves the sales this time. As for the critical response, all I've got to say is \\"Critics man...critics never got nothin' nice to say, man.\\"
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I have been a long time fan of nature documentaries. I have seen just about every major and minor series out there, so I can safely say that I am not unfamiliar with what makes or brakes a good nature program. Film quality, editing, narration and subject matter all have their parts to play. Some will be a bit stronger in one area over another, but rarely will there be such a glaringly negative portion of a show/series present, which makes it unwatchable. This is one of those shows. The narration work done by none other than queen bee Oprah Winfrey is quite simply ATROCIOUS. She has a bad sense of timing. It seems like she is reading a script for the first time as she speaks. It makes the audience feel as though she is speaking to a five year old. Her grasp of the subject matter is clearly lacking.(Very little background in anything nature related.) And the worst part is that this is all very distracting, and takes a lot away from the overall experience. Basically, if I want to watch some of it, I pretty much have to mute the sound. Luckily, you can now get this series with the original BBC David Attenborough narration. I can not presently comment on his work in this, because I have not seen that version. I am confident that he does is usual great work though.         As for the other facets of the series. Very well done, overall. Much of it is a rehash of a lot of work previously done in Blue Planet, Nature, The Wild series, Planet Earth etc. etc. but there are some nice new interesting tidbits here. As expected the film quality is very good, especially in HD.  If you want a more original,new(ish) series,with much better narration. I highly recommend the Wild series. Wild Pacific and Wild Russia are top notch.     Steer clear of the Discovery Oprah version. Get the BBC Attenborough version.      With Oprah narration--->1/5  Without Oprah narration--->4/5
B003K025V4|4.0|During the last four years, Miley Cyrus has become one of the most popular and opinion-formed celebrities in the tabloid world today, mostly because of her popular alter ego Hannah Montana, but also because of her own persona. Lately she's been taking some steps away from her Montana character. Let's face it; Cyrus can't be holding on her character forever and neither can be really blamed for wanting to distinguish herself from the character, which she's obviously demonstrates by releasing promiscuous music videos and a sexual pose on her new album (which brings the thoughts back to Britney Spears' pose on her \\"Greatest Hits\\" cover).    But in a music industry where almost all female pop singers sounds pretty much equal, Miley have had some struggle to really stand out among them. Sure, she's had a few hits, but mostly her songs have been pretty shallow and forgettable. Besides (whether Miley fans like it or not) she's had some noteworthy competition from her fellow Disney colleagues Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato (in fact, Gomez album were better than anything Miley released in 2009). And Miley's own music isn't really dramatically different from Hannah's music.     I shall confess that I was far from impressed when I heard \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" and thought immediately that Miley had dogged herself from all musical credibility and the absent of her in the music industry wouldn't be that remarkable (considering that she's proclaimed that she wants to leave the music industry for a while). Fortunately, that isn't the case; Miley's new album is actually a step ahead her previous albums, filled with catchy and listenable songs.    However, there's a remarkable notion with this album; why in the world were \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" chosen as the first single? After listening to the whole album, there's no doubt that \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" is the worst song, if not one of Miley's worst songs ever made. Although the sound is as far from a Hannah Montana-esque melody, it still comes off as a plain, uninspired and overproduced tune, which sounds reminiscent of a Britney song. And the music video appears as a vague excuse for Miley to sexualize herself. Whoever was in charge of choosing that song as the first single, should be immediately fired, since it's a pity that the least interesting song should be representative for the entire album.    The rest of the tunes are fortunately more noteworthy. Basically, the songs are mostly pop songs with nice lyrics and a dash of electronic elements, but more restrained than Lady Gaga and Christina Aguilera's recent work. The songs are with no doubt more enjoyable and listenable than anything Miley released last year. There are the upbeat, energetic songs as \\"Liberty Walk\\", \\"Who Owns My Heart\\", and \\"Two More Lonely People\\" (which resembles a song from the 80's), \\"Scars\\" and \\"Robot\\". There's two cute ballads as \\"Stay\\" and \\"Forgiveness and Love\\", while \\"Permanent December\\" sounds like a song that could appear on the Ke$ha album. If you'll look away \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" and the forgettable ballad \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\", you've got a quite compelling album. While it's not the most memorable pop album of all time, it's still a musical triumph for Miley.     Only time will tell if Miley really plans to abandon the music industry. Until then, she can be pleased to having released a one of her best albums to date.

B0025KVLRO|4.0|\\"Please Please Me\\" is a full-bloodied debut showing much potential and unheard-of class in comparison with the early rock'n'roll era.

Even though they were only starting, the first album is so good that they next surpassed it only with their sixth, A Hard Day's Night soundtrack.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|So as I'm waiting for a release date for the first season of NBC's new show community, I thought I would write a review of the first season. I can not recommend this show enough. The first view episodes are a little rough as the cast was struggling with where they wanted the show to go and their chemistry, but by the end of the season I found myself not able to wait a week for the next episode. Many people have problems with Chevy Chase, but I thought he really brought the show together and was just flat out hilarious. While the main character Jeff (Joel McHale) is enough to keep you entertained, he is joined by an incredibly talented and hilarious cast. Middle-aged divorcée Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), and Britta Perry(Gillian Jacobs) a mid-twenties woman returning to school who plays Jeff's main love interest are among other main characters. Along with them are Troy and Abed (who together deliver a very amusing bromance), a high school graduate who lost her scholarship after an addiction to adderall, and of course, the ever funny Pierce Hawthorne(Chevy Chase) a retired older man who is for some random reason back at community college. Ken Jeong joins the cast in the second episode as the students mentally insane spanish teacher, Senor Chang.   This show never gets old, especially with guest actors such as Jack Black , Owen Wilson, and Katharine McPhee. I can not recommend this show enough!

B000000LZV|5.0|On what was a triple album release, The Minutemen blew me away as soon as I hit the 4th track. And there were 39 more to go! This album is essential to anyone who wants to know this band but also for anyone who wants to expand their musical taste past what is going to be fed to you by mainstream media. Even tho \\"Corona\\" is the theme song to \\"Jackass\\". This album is beautiful and confusing and just plain amazing. Do what you will but please, for your own mind, do yourself a favor and buy this and REALLY listen. It might change your life.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|If you have been let down or disappointed by the last few efforts by Eminem, don't count him out just yet. 'Recovery' is, in my opinion, probably one of the best albums since his debut, if not the best of his entire career. Gone are the immature pop hits that have occupied his albums since [[ASIN:B00065XJ52 Encore (Deluxe Edition)]]. In their place are really deep songs that aren't really hardcore rap or hip-hop but certainly aren't weak, forgettable pop songs that made it onto his album in the past. On a few tracks of 'Recovery' he acknowledges that his past efforts, especially 'Relapse', weren't that great. He also states that with 'Recovery' he wanted to raise the bar and return with something that would silence his critics and reassure his fans that he was back to true form and better than ever. In my opinion, 'Recovery' does just that. It's a deep and personal album but better produced than [[ASIN:B00192M9FC Relapse]] and features some of his best lyrics and raps. If you thought Eminem had lost his edge, give this album a listen because I think it's clear that he found it again.<br /><br />The Good: For me, what makes 'Recovery' such a great album is how personal it is. There are a lot of tracks that deal with his personal demons such as his toxic relationship with his ex wife, the death of his close friend, his inability to deal with fame, his addictions. Unlike with 'Relapse' that seemed to lack any real feeling or personality, this time around he holds nothing back and combines revealing lyrics with some great beats that gave the album a real epic feel, starting with \\"Cold Wind Blows\\" where he starts off the album proclaiming his return and striking out at some of his adversaries and critics (including, of course, Mariah Carey) and the album ventures into personal territory from there. \\"Talkin' To Myself\\" shows off a different side of Eminem as he reveals his insecurities and admits that he envied the rise of rappers like Lil Wayne and Kanye West and wanted to tear them down just because he was starting to fall off his pedestal. He goes so far as to apologize to them for wanting to rip them, which seems very mature and new for an artist who used to go after everyone and anything in the past that irked him even in the slightest. \\"Going Through Changes\\" is a track where he admits he needed help and that he had issues with addictions; \\"Space Bound\\" deals with his fears of being alone and isolated and how those fears impact his relationships with others; \\"25 to Life\\" uses the metaphor of a relationship gone sour with a woman to describe his relationship with hip-hop. There are also some upbeat/triumphant tracks such as \\"You're Never Over\\" where he eulogizes and celebrates the life of his friend Proof and is able to turn a dark situation into motivation to go on and accomplish big things; \\"Cinderella Man\\" features a boastful, proud Eminem who proclaims that mediocrity isn't acceptable in his career anymore; \\"No Love\\" deals with him getting over being dissed and ignored by a woman he loves and how he won't let her actions bring him down. There are definitely a wide variety of emotions at play on 'Recovery' that shows off Eminem's insecurities, issues and his strengths and makes for a great listen overall.<br /><br />The Bad: A few tracks didn't work as well for me and disturbed the flow of the album. \\"Won't Back Down\\" featuring P!nk sounds like an attempt at rock and a freestyle session - it was okay but I had no desire to listen to it again after hearing it for the first time. \\"Seduction\\" and \\"On Fire\\" felt like filler tracks. There are a few tracks, such as \\"W.T.P.\\" (white trash party) and \\"Seduction\\" where Eminem tries to be flirtatious and attractive through lyrics and it just felt awkward and out of place.<br /><br />In all, the number of good tracks with depth, feeling and good production definitely outweighs the weaker tracks. I was really impressed by this effort from Eminem and have had over half of the album on repeat. This is definitely worth checking out and worth purchasing.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"25 to Life\\", \\"Going Through Changes\\", \\"You're Never Over\\", \\"Space Boud\\", \\"No Love\\"worth checking out and worth purchasing.    Listen To These: \\"25 to Life\\", \\"Going Through Changes\\", \\"You're Never Over\\", \\"Space Boud\\", \\"No Love\\"
0307592839|5.0|Jennifer Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad is an excellent novel, a rumination on the passage of time, of how we get from \\"A\\" to \\"B\\" in our lives.  Goon Squad is not really a novel in the traditional sense of the word, but it is much more cohesive than the usual collection of linked stories--the themes of the ravages of time and the pain of losing one's youth are in each piece.  The characters all show up again and again and each piece moves the narrative, such as it is, forward.  It is hard to do Goon Squad justice in a brief review--a pithy distillation will likely miss the overriding elegance of the narrative.  Goon Squad is experimental fiction--one chapter is told entirely in a power point presentation--yet everything works.  I am certain that this novel will satisfy all daring readers.  The story is accessible, readable and compelling.  Egan's ability to communicate the heartbreak of the passing of time is so potent, so well done.  A Visit from the Goon Squad is a thought-provoking, entertaining work.  Well done.  Enjoy!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|\\"Recovery\\" finds Eminem rejuvenated and in reflective mode, even apologising for his last 2 CDs somewhat (\\"This time around it's different, Last two albums didn't count, Encore I was on drugs, Rehab I was crushing them out.\\") on \\"Talkin' 2 myself\\" featuring Kobe and touching on self doubt and inadequacies sgainst against a groovy guitar-festooned backdrop while the haunting \\"On fire\\" is a response to critics.<br /><br />\\"Won't back down has a crunchy guitar ruff and features an unusually laid-back Pink and finds him in fighting mode, while \\"Going through changes\\" finds him battling depression and contemplating suicide (I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,<br />I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?<br />I [don't] give a f***, only thing I fear, is Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her).<br /><br />#1 hit \\"Not afraid\\" is a gentle song with an incredibly catchy chorus, skittery almost martial beats and haunting synth strings, and the uncharacteristically humble lyrics \\"To the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back I promise to never go back on that promise. In fact, Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was \\"ehh\\", Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground, Relax, I ain't going back to that now, There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down\\".<br /><br />\\"No love\\" features Lil Wayne and samples Haddaway's Dance hit \\"What is love\\". \\"Space bound\\" is gentle with lovely guitars and similar is \\"25 to life\\",  while the minimal \\"Cinderella man\\" has martial beats.<br /><br />\\"Love the way you lie\\" touches on abusive relationships and fittingly features Rihanna singing the chorus against a lovely guitar backdrop, while closing \\"Untitled\\" features a breathless delivery from Eminem.<br /><br />Filled with lyrical self lacerations and his usual great punchlines and witty cultural references, \\"Recovery\\" is a winner!

0553266306|5.0|This review shall be short and sweet, as most everything that needed to be said probably was.<br /><br />I loved this book, it is definitely one of my top 3 books ever.<br />The Day of the Jackal basically pits an ingenious assassin, the Jackal, against an ingenious detective, Claude Lebel, in a race against time. The details within this plot (which is intriguing in itself) really make this novel shine, and I love how everything will finally connect at different parts of the story. You may find yourself scratching your head with the sudden introduction of some new characters (like I did), but reading on a few chapters, it will all reveal itself naturally like a good thriller should.<br /><br />I'll conclude by quoting the inside jacket of my version of this book, which sums up my review:<br />\\"That everyone knows President de Gaulle ultimately died a natural death does not for an instant detract from the die-cut reality of this driving and remarkable novel of terror, suspense, human malevolence, and triumph. Let any skeptic begin and he will soon be hooked and then enthralled\\".
B003RNXIBK|5.0|I feel that this is his best since The Eminem Show. And I have a feeling that over time it might be percieved as an undeniable classic. But it will need time to sink in. The only song on this album that is skip worthy to me is... none, I mean not all the songs are a 10/10 but there are no songs that if you listen to a few times you will not like.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Not much else to say except that this is Em's best album since The Marshall Mathers LP... and it's not even close.    He's focused and he's pissed off.  A scary combo when you consider his raw talent of both writing and delivery.  A must-own for all Em fans, for fans of hip hop and people who appreciate phenomenal music, both on the production side and the writing/delivery side.     Album of the year in any category.      A stellar piece of art.    Kudos Mr. Mathers and thank you.
1569242739|5.0|I was disappointed when I found that my new born son had dairy and egg allergies because that meant I had to give up on my new found passion for baking. As a family we all love our cakes and desserts and I kept feeling deprived & miserable when I had to skip every time. Until I discovered vegan baking. I tried out a couple of recipes on various food blogs and found them all to be from this AWESOME book.     I have posted these ones that I found online with pictures on my own blog: [...]    I would suggest that you try them out, and if you like them, then go out and buy the book, like I did.    It's quite small and not very impressive looking, next to the heavy hard covered tomes on the bookstore shelves but don't let that fool you. Terry and Isa are pure geniuses. and there are many many recipes in this book. Yes 75! and possibilities for endless variations!I have eaten butter and egg laden cakes all my life and I LOVED the ones I easily whipped up in my own kitchen thanks to the easy recipes from this book.    I also make them into cakes rather than cupcakes.    Sure some of them call for a few ingredients that you may have to head to a specialty store to find, but most are from common ingredients you probably already have. Also they are not exactly healthy with quite a bit of sugar, margarine or oil but this book doesn't purport to be \\"healthy\\"- there are a few low fat recipes, but most are quite decadent and delicious.
B003KRJNBW|1.0|Was not very entertained.  This movie seemed like a cross between Water World & a bad Western (would say Tombstone but cannot compare a classic to this one).  The dialogue and story line were left a lot to be desired.  Found myself bored many times while watching and the story had many holes.  Not worth renting...
1439175640|4.0|I really liked the book. I found the recipes simple and pretty easy to follow. However, other than that the book does not represent any pictures of what the final baked good should have looked like. Although the book only had pictures for some of its famous recipes. Also, the quality of the book is not good as well, the pages seemed scruffed and torn.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|What happens when you take \\"Wake Island\\" (a great WWII Hollywood propaganda film), the timeless \\"Casablanca\\", the superb fantasy adventure \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" and a few other war films that glorify war and add Quentin Tarantino's rather vivid imagination to the mix?<br /><br /> You get \\"Inglorious Basterds\\", a fantasy war thriller that pays homage to all the great films of war as glorious adventure genre with an outlandish plot that Tarentino gets to work.<br /><br /> The story opens with Lieutenant Aldo Raine briefing his squad of eight Jewish American soldiers that their job is to kill Nazis. Lots of Nazis. Pure fantasy.<br /><br /> On the Nazi side, there is SS Colonel Hans Landa who is proud to be called \\"The Jew Hunter\\" and the film spends considerable time demonstrating how Landa earned the sobriquet. Landa, played in an Academy Award winning style by Chrisoph Waltz is comic book exaggerated and, if you know your history, all too real of a type.<br /><br /> While the \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" are wreaking their havoc, a Paris cinema owner with a past is being romanced by a Nazi hero. With good reason, she rejects his advances, but he finds a way to inveigle himself into her life that lets her realize a diabolical ambition.<br /><br /> The paths of the Inglorious Basterds and the cinema owner intersect in a beyond the pale pair of plots.<br /><br /> The movie is pure Tarentino. Inventive story and story telling. Blood and violence by the bucket. Characters quickly drawn in a comic book style. And no attachment to reality, but that minor detail is forgotten as Tarentino rushes along.<br /><br /> Great moviemaking. (But a lot of people will find the bloodletting upsetting.)<br /><br />Jerry
B00000AF95|4.0|Mark st Johns (R.i.P)  while not being as good a songwriter as Vinnie Vincent was a excellent guitar player. This disc isn't as great as 'lick it up' from the year before , but it is a good solid rocker. It has the hit single 'heavens on fire' on this one as well , kiss was back at the front of the pack and they maintained that status throughout the 80's by any standard.  This disc is easy to listen to and was well recieved by hard rock and metal fans of the day because it's good melodic metal unfortunately Mark St. Johns would be gone after this one and we never got to see him grow and of course he passed away a few years ago.  I don't buy into one star reviews for this cd ignore them if you dig melodic metal because this is a fun solid rock cd.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|I recently saw this movie as a sneak preview and loved it.  Couldn't wait to buy it.  Went on vacation with my son and grandson and put in the movie when we had down time. My 28 year old and and his nephew [my grandson] were out laughing each other.  And you know what, I forgot how funny and cute and smart this movie was.  I loved the family dynamics and how the movie and storyline did not pull punches on responsibility, death, gluttony, and of course George Clooney [Mr. Fox].  Great purchase and something that we will watch over and over again.  This is an instant classic which we will be watching again at Thanksgiving after dinner.
B000000YWO|5.0|Often underrated, this great album shows Evans at his maturity. He is back to his swinging roots with Ray Brown,the idol of all bassists that ever played with Evans and his all-time favorite drummer Philly Joe Jones.Harold Land is a tenor giant not heard often enough since his Clifford Brown-Max Roach days and his lyrical style fits well with Evans. Kenny Burrell is at his best on this album,especially on \\"Child is Born\\" and that is saying a lot.  In one of his interviews Bill pointed out his love for playing with horns and accompanying other soloists and cited this album as one of his all-time favorites.  He confessed to not liking to listen to his own records except for few special ones and included Quintessence on this short list  So, disregard the negative comments of one of the \\"experts\\" here. If you love Evans and if you love mature, swinging jazz, don't hesitate giving Quintessence a chance to enrich your life.
B003JR1JV0|1.0|All I can say is...look at the cover, she tries SO hard to be like Britney when Britney posed in such a similar outfit and such a similar pose! It's pathetic. The cd is horrible also...
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I bought this as a graduation gift for my child.  We have is on vhs but easier on dvd.  Transaction smooth.
1401308201|5.0|It is much bigger than I imagined but it was beautiful! Fresh out BRAND NEW and feel much closer with the casts and the Broadway performance. I havent seen one myself yet but I already felt like that I was actually there by the book!
0739384198|5.0|Don't start the trilogy with this the last book. This is one exciting book. I have read the books and listened to the CDs. I was riveted the entire time. Poor Stig is gone, a loss to us all.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Brand new, fair price, fair shipping and fast!! Just perfectly brand new and just loved listening it as if I was actually at the Broadway show.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This 2010 Sundance Film Festival award winner is the story of Ree, a courageous 17-year old young woman in rural Missouri.  She cares for her young brother and sister as well as her mentally absent mother under extremely stressful conditions.  Sometimes the neighbors help out but the family lives in poverty.  The father cooks methamphetamine and is out of jail on bond.  But he has disappeared, and if Ree doesn't find him, the family property will be confiscated.  This is a horrible situation for anyone to find themselves in, but Ree, played by newcomer Jennifer Lawrence, has the kind of inner strength that makes her confront all the forces that try to hinder her search.<br /><br />John Hawkes is cast has her father's brother and he seems to know more than he is letting her know.  And her other kinfolk are close-mouthed and aggressive.  She is even beaten up by some of them.  But her determination in the face of seemingly impossible odds make her the kind of heroine to be admired.<br /><br />There's constant tension in this film and some rather gruesome details.  But how it all plays out is positive and believable and made me want to applaud this very special heroine.  This is truly a worthwhile film even though it depicts a sad and difficult way of life.  Film aficionados will love it.
B000NY62MI|5.0|great book- i cryed alot, but loved it so much, i bought the movie because i wanted my husband to see it- he cryed too *(*
B000F4LPJ6|1.0|I fail to understand how viewers can go on and on about the philosophical/psychological/sociological aspects of this film.  It's tacky, badly acted and scripted, and in general a third-rate movie.  Perhaps it indeed has a message, but it's lost in the presentation.  Not nearly as shocking or controversial as it is made out to be, Battle Royale is a must-miss movie.  Watch a film by Kurosawa or Ozu instead if you really want to see good Japanese filmmaking.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is such a terrific new album by Eminem. All the songs are well produced, put together and sung, that you don't even have to skip any song ever!!! Some of the songs that stick out to me most are Going Through Changes(which is a very sad song) which samples \\"Changes\\" by Ozzy Osbourne, W.T.P, 25 to Life, So Bad, the first single from the album \\"Not Afraid\\" and more. This album shows how talented Eminem is and how far he came from when he first started. If you're a fan of Eminem and good music in general,then this album will be perfect for you to buy!
B000BCE9BI|5.0|My grand daughters and I liked these movies a lot, we liked the scary parts, the hero parts and the family first parts, but the kissing parts were head turners for two of us. Will and others make the sacrifices needed to keep the world safe. Lots of good acting by other well-known actors as well.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|I love all of Miley Cyrus's music, and this cd doesn't disappoint at all! Every song is wonderfully sung, has amazing beats, ballads and shows how much Miley has matured in her music, and is finding more of her own style of music. Her new album doesn't have one song that you want to skip over at all, and once you start listening to it...you will never want to stop. Her last cd's made me appreciate her singing and lyrical talent, but this cd made me love her music...even more. I love the cover of Poisons \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\\" She has terrific vocals on there, and  the acoustic guitar is terrifically played on that song.     It is such a different, but amazingly new sound for Miley Cyrus, and a way to stretch her musical ability. This will be one of my top favorite albums of the year, and I can't wait to see more of what Miley has up her sleeve. She gets five stars, because she gets getting better, and has more of a promising future with finding out different styles of music that she can perform beautifully.
0385528752|5.0|Chip and Dan have it together in this book entitled \\"Switch\\".  It's a practical guide for anyone to discern \\"TBU\\", true but useless information and understand the simple components that we humans respond to for change.  It just doesn't matter if you have the \\"authority\\", this book will demonstrate with numerous examples and practice applications how to effect change in one person or a culture.  Sound impossible?  You gotta read this book!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I have never taken the time to comment on an album because quite frankly most of the crap that comes out today is so unoriginal it doenst deserve my time.  That being said, this is the by far the best album of the year so far.  With nothing short of genious guitar play and a great mix of young and old vocals.  Fergie belts it like i never would have guessed she could.  Cant say enough this is a must own and anyone that says its not has zero musical ear.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I admit I wasn't sure what to think of when I first saw \\"Fringe\\", but this season sucked me in.     After a strange incident aboard an airplane, FBI agent Olivia Dunham is summoned in to help solve the case when her partner and secret lover John Scott is exposed to a toxin that is killing him. This forces Olivia to rely on the help of Walter Bishop, a brilliant scientist who has been in a mental institution for 17 years, and Peter Bishop, Walter's sarcastic and skeptical son, to solve the case. But this only opens up Olivia to a whole new world of pseudoscience and a threat against our world.     This show is addicting. The characters are memorable, especially Walter Bishop, and their interaction is entertaining. The plot, while occasionally a bit gross, is well-done and keeps you guessing. It's not as confusing to follow as J.J. Abrams' \\"Lost\\", and, to me, it's better done.
B0039TD7PY|2.0|I'm sorry but I'm going to have to disagree with most of the other reviewers here.  The guy who mixed this has some questions to answer.  1)  Why did he have to crank the audience so loud?  2)  Why is James' vocal sound so trebly?  3)  Why does the acoustic guitar have to be so compressed?    If there's one thing I've come to expect from James Taylor, it's quality audio.  This album is unfortunately not in that category for me.  The reason I'll give it two stars is to be fair as I've not bothered to play the DVD, which could be good but I bought it for the cd.
1400052173|5.0|Book arrived in good shape-well packaged to protect the book cover from ripping in transit. Just began to read and so far is very readable and easy to follow.
B001NXDSLG|5.0|Got this as a gift for my hippie husband for Father's Day and he LOVED it!!
B003NTSBUG|2.0|Yeah, my wife and I pretty much figured this movie out 20 minutes into it which made it seem rather silly. After a while we were just wondering if there was supposed to be another twist as it was so obvious.  It had some entertainment value, I suppose.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun. The point of seeing this is to look at the same story through a new perspective. Looking at life through a new mind is the purpose of a remake.     Before you watch this- read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, shove the memories in a jar, shake them up and pour them through Tim Burton's creative process. I think his vision was captivating. I found myself loving the mad hatter and wishing him a friend of mine. I loved the silliness strewn about and I loved the art. I loved Alice and the costumes and the general madness.    I loved it. If you aren't typically a Tim Burton fan, then don't be surprised if it isn't your cup of tea.*snicker* If you love to see the world from different eyes filtered through a different mind, and you love Tim and Johnny's work, then you will enjoy your adventure.
0671891634|5.0|Peter Lynch, once manager of Fidelity Magellan, compiled one of the most amazing track records in the history of investing. Lynch took the reigns at Magellan in May of 1977, when the Dow was at 899 - and headed to 801. He left in May 1990. If you had put $10,000 with Lynch in 1977 and just left it there, you would have had over $250,000 when Lynch retired in 1990. That's an average annual return of 29.2%.<br /><br />Among his favorite stocks were S&Ls. At one point, he owned over 150 of them. As he writes in his book Beating the Street, \\"Once, I confessed to the Barron's panel that I'd invested in 135 of the 145 thrifts whose prospectuses landed on my desk. The response from Alan Abelson [Barron's editor, long known for his wit] was typical: `What happened to the others?'\\"<br /><br />Lynch had his own schema for separating S&Ls. He had the \\"bad guys,\\" who perpetuated the fraud. Most of the frauds, Lynch notes, were privately owned (Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan being an exception) and would not have survived the scrutiny of being a public company. Then there were the \\"greedy guys,\\" who couldn't leave well enough alone. In their thirst for greater profits, they followed the old hackneyed measure of borrowing as much as they could and putting it to work in risky ventures.<br /><br />Lynch loved these S&Ls. As he explains it, he bought them in such large quantities because they were often small and Magellan was so large, such that \\"to get nourishment out of them, I had to consume large quantities, like the whales that are forced to survive on plankton.\\" One reason he loved them was the unique way in which they go public.<br /><br />Review from Agora Financial, publisher of economic and financial analysis including [[ASIN:047048327X Financial Reckoning Day Fallout: Surviving Today's Global Depression]], [[ASIN:0470483261 The New Empire of Debt: The Rise and Fall of an Epic Financial Bubble]], and [[ASIN:0470222778 I.O.U.S.A.: One Nation.

1400067936|5.0|Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb observes two rules. First, the author sticks to things he either personally observed or ideas he personally developed, and, second, to only write on topics he had thought deeply about and found easy to discuss. In Taleb's own words, \\"Everything that remotely felt like work was out.\\" This lazy man's approach to a book - or a two-hour lecture topic - has the advantage of keeping the topic focused on areas of deep knowledge, areas where the writer or speaker has spent a lot of time and effort sorting things out.<br /><br />Review by a writer for Agora Financial, publisher of economic and financial analysis including [[ASIN:047048327X Financial Reckoning Day Fallout: Surviving Today's Global Depression]], [[ASIN:0470483261 The New Empire of Debt: The Rise and Fall of an Epic Financial Bubble]], and [[ASIN:0470222778 I.O.U.S.A.: One Nation.

B003TA69A8|5.0|I was sorry when David Tennant left the role, because he was my favorite doctor. But I love Matt Smith as the new doctor just as much. I think he's brilliant. And the writing! This is what great science fiction should be!     I'm enjoying this new Who incarnation tremendously.

0061765236|5.0|Within reading the first few pages of The Pact I actually had to put the book down and walk away.  It was so gut wrenching, I simply couldn't take it.  But it sat on my coffee table and demanded to be read, and so I did.  First let me say that the dynamic between Chris and Emily is intriguing and engrossing.  Their relationship is a perfect example of how we fail to communicate the most important elements of our love for one and other. It reminds the reader that love is not a broad brush description of feeling.  Emily's love for Chris, while powerful in its own right, remained harbored in the confines of friendship.  Chris felt a love that moved well beyond that, creating the end result, a tragedy that neither of them saw coming and neither knew how to cope with.  The devastation and decimation these families go through is, at times, far too much to take but only lends to the concept that love means different things to different people.<br /><br />That being said, I do have a few complaints, though none detracted enough from the overall story to warrant a lower rating.<br />First, I find it difficult to understand how a bright boy like Chris failed to take action when Emily shared her suicidal idea.  And by action I don't mean grabbing a gun.<br />Second, I'm still unclear as to how Emily decided suicide was the only option.  I didn't get enough from her to make that conclusion which left me saying, Huh?<br /><br />Bottom line for me at the end of the day, was that the story was considerate and thoughtful enough to overlook these tiny flaws.  Jodi's writing is superb and the end of the story leaves one gasping.  My heart still aches.
B003LYJUXU|5.0|I've read some reviews here from people that have no rationale in reviewing an item that is clear on the portrayal of what it contains. This is NOT a greatest hits album, this is NOT a best of album, this IS Oasis' singles compilation. If you are an Oasis fan like myself, and have had the pleasure in hearing all their singles throughout their career, this is worth owning since you have all those songs in one album. And obviously you should know what songs will be part of this collection; No surprises here, nor anything shocking. The description is clear of the item being reviewed.<br /><br />If you are expecting a Greatest Hits album keep waiting for it because who knows how long it will take. If you are looking for a Best Of, you have `Stop the Clocks' released in 2006. In fact, if you want their B sides (or at least most of them) get 'The Masterplan' released in 1998. If you want their Singles all in one album, then this is a great buy.<br /><br />I also encourage people that are not aware of Oasis singles to get this.<br /><br />5 stars!!!
B000JLSM00|5.0|For all those people who claim that John Wayne couldn't act I defy them to explain his great performance in this classic John Ford Western. Wayne, Ford and Jeffrey Hunter were at there best during the making of this film. My father would often tell me that Jeffrey Hunter had been one of his playmates growing up. I find this all the more interesting after seeing what an excellent actor Hunter was. The blu-ray edition of this film is exquisite! The photography of this film is just beautiful and the storyline is very well played out. A very, very good classic Western. Hollywood at its best!
0393072231|5.0|I LOVED liars poker and this book is probably Lewis' book that most reminds me of it.    The people that Lewis picked for the book are all the key people around the crisis.  Leisman was the guy that basically has been railing against subprime mortgages since they first burst on the scene in the 90's.  Greg Lippman is the brash bond trader who basically \\"sells\\" the idea of shorting the subprime mortage CDO to everyone in site, Cornwall Capital are the \\"Garage Band Hedge Funds\\" that appear to be bumbling idiots except for their ability to spot value stocks (or really bad bonds), and finally Michael Burry.  He is the guy that basically established \\"the way\\" to do it in the first place.      There were a few things I found very interesting with this book...    1) Mostly you hear in the news about a handful of investors, John Paulson, Jeff Greene, Kyle Bass, etc that made all that money with this trade.  What the book traces, is that they all got the idea of shorting the CDO from Greg Lipmann.  And he got the idea from the recluse, glass eyed (literally), doctor turned hedge fund operator Michael Burry.    2) It is interesting to see how these traders were very easily able to manipulate the Bond Rating agencies.  One of the thing that was very interesting was how a 5% price appreciation was built into the agency model.  And that average FICO scores were driving the AAA rating. What IB's figured out, was that it's very easily to construct a bond that has several really bad credits offset by the higher fico scores.  But the thing was that the higher fico scores actually were mostly \\"thin file credits\\".  Those are people that have limited credit history, but have paid on time.  And then to make the problem worse, the Synthetic CDO were just endless bets on how the CDO's would fail.      3) The premise of the book is that it's extremely hard for many people to really know the risk they are taking....even people that knew something bad was going to happen still got burned with trading it wrong.  CEO of Morgan Stanley, John Mack, couldn't explain why the loss to his firm was so great.  Regulators have broad knowledge but not specific enough know-how to spot these things.  Ditto with rating agencies.      In the end, even people that royally screwed up ended up walking away with millions.  And that, I believe, is Lewis'point.  In Brazil, for example, bank directors are personally liable for losses.  In the US, that system doesn't exist.  So you'll continue to have this cycle of more regulation, more risk-taking, and no consequence.    And for the Liars Poker fans, the end of the book talks about a meeting between John Guetfrend and Michael Lewis.

B001609SQA|5.0|The first 'Alien' movie was a smash hit and very original, spinning many movies off. 'Aliens (2)' attempts to hold to the original direction, and complements 'Alien' well. 'Aliens' is very much the expected sequel, but I think watching 'Alien' first would be beneficial, providing a much richer history for the 'Aliens' sequel. If you like sci-fi and action - with a good dose of suspense - then you would certainly enjoy this movie. Unfortunately, some scenes are missing from this version. And why, like 'Doom' and so many other movies, why is there always a large sewer running beneath the floor grating? But, occassional flaws aside, this makes a well-entertaining and well-engrossing movie which is bound to please any sci-fi buff.
074356619X|5.0|Received in excellent condition in a very timely manner.  This CD is wonderful and I play it in my car while driving.  Very encouraging, very hopeful, very calming and inspiring. LOVE IT.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|Plenty of interesting action with the predator element simultaneously increasing - not too fast, not to slow. Excellent introduction and timing of the predator's role, creating a cliff-hanger type of movie. A bit over the top in the preliminary action sequences ... but enjoyable for action junkies none-the-less - or for those who don't think its over the top. In many ways this first movie is better than the sequel, especially with its timing and adequate realism (for an action film) and should prove very worthy before seeing the sequel, and is certainly a worthwhile action movie on its own. When 'Predator' first came out, it was a well-received movie, much talked about, original, and continues to hold its complete merit throughout the many years and the many movies since it was released.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|Wonderful product for Gilmore Girl fans. I got this for my two teens and they love it!
B001OQCV2O|4.0|I'm coming out of the closet right now. I'm a Roland Emmerich apologist. Independence Day was a seminal film of my childhood. Godzilla was an entertaining/memorable film. I've probably seen The Day After Tomorrow more than any human should. And I am one of the few that remember and kind of like 10,000 BC. Thusly, I was in the theater Day 1 for 2012. A true Master of Disaster, nobody can destroy the Earth like Roland Emmerich can.<br /><br />But first of all, there's setup. Wait? What? Roland Emmerich blows stuff up, Roland Emmerich doesn't do character development! I'll also admit right now that 2012 probably could have been cut down, expecially in the first 30 minutes, since it is too long of a movie, and it takes a bit too long for the Earth to start crumbling down. But even so, the actors do fine with what they're given. John Cusack is John Cusack, Danny Glover is underused, Chiwetel Ejiofor did the best with bad material, and Amanda Peet should never be allowed to be in a film again. And again, while the plot is serviceable for the destruction, the parts where the Earth was getting the crap kicked out of it could have been cut down. As for the Mayan Prophecy, stupid? Yes. Serviceable for giving an excuse to pulverize the Earth? Yes.<br /><br />First major action sequence: Los Angeles crumbles apart in a GIANT Earthquake. How crazy is this scene? A car drives through a collapsing building. Believable? No. Fun to watch? Oh yeah. Then we get to see Las Vegas get hit by that same GIANT Earthquake. How crazy is this scene? We get to see a plane dive below and above collapsing hotels. That's pretty exiting. Then we get to see the Super Volcano at Yellowstone blow its top. Believable? No. Fun? It lingers a little too long, but yes. Then from there, it's just a crapstorm of disasters. The Vatican comes down, making for some religious symbolism. Cruise ships get flipped over by waves. The White House is crused by an Aircraft Carrier. All variety of places are hit by giant waves and are flooded. A plane crashes and its occupants have to get off by using expensive sports cars. Again, while you do have to wait a while to see all this happen, it's incredibly satisfying & cool when you actually get to them.<br /><br />But what I also love about 2012 is the absolute insanity of it. There's a scene where two characters are saying how they're feeling apart from each other, just for a GIANT crack to open up between them in the ground. The movie even takes the all-popular crazy, but correct guy and takes him to the next level with Woody Harrelson. Nothing is destroyed in a nice way, or just a simple explosion or anything, no, it's long, it's drawn out, it's destructive, and it's a beautiful thing to watch. At least for me it is. Your opinion may differ. I mean, there's a scene where an \\"Ark\\" is fixing to crash into the Summit of Mt. Everest, aka the highest mountain in the world! INSANITY! And they squeeze the scene out with everything that it's worth, then some. If this isn't Roland Emmerich's love letter to his admirers, like me, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Overall, 2012 is the CGI grandfather of all disaster films. The SyFy channel & other disaster movies spend two hours on what takes 30 seconds here. Remember Poseidon Adventure? You get that in a cooler looking 30 second sequence. Have you ever watched Category 6, or one of the many other SyFy channel crapfests that aim to destroy the world on a measly budget? Yeah, I have, and 2012 takes a dump on those films in all its two-hundred million dollar budget glory.

030745455X|5.0|I like trilogies, but it always seems like the second book is \\"stuck in the middle\\" - mere filler between the introduction and the climax. If not told well, the middle can drag. Not so here. The second book in Stieg Larsson's trilogy builds nicely off the first, opening a new plot, but building on the characters readers became familiar with in the first. The book could stand on its own, but benefits from the character profiles of the first, and sets up the third book nicely. Read this one on a long trip - and couldn't wait to get to a location that had the third on the shelves. For those who loved
B002ZG982S|1.0|How can you give this movie anything but a 1 star? I would give it less if I could. This is not a place to review the comic (DC) or what he had on his belt. It is a review of the movie. And most of the reviewers have not seen the movie, and I do not think most people will see it, WITH GOOD REASON! Its total box office in its first weekend was a whopping $5,085,000. That is pathetic! They were hoping to cash in on Megan Fox. It did not work. It is a rehash, redone to death, shooter film. Its jokes are old, its plot line is old, and its action is old (oooo big bang, big explosion, big guns)     If you have nothing to do, and I mean nothing, including watching paint dry, go see this movie and waste your money and time.     0 out of 5 Stars.

0307346617|5.0|This was my first zombie book.  I'm not into reading horror fiction books, but I had to give this a try after all the positive reviews.  I think with over 600 reviews, all I can add to this is that it was one of those books I could not put down, which is not many. Last night I even had a dream the city was beginning to get overrun by the zombie plaque.  I hope to find similar books, and yes its a fun and worthy of your time and money.

B003KUSUG8|4.0|Note: This review is a bit longwinded to better get my point across about his resurgence on this album. If you just want to read the review of the album itself, skip down to \\"Enter Recovery\\".    At its core, Eminem's story is that of your stereotypical rock superstar. An explosive debut (The Slim Shady LP), his magnum opus (The Marshall Mathers LP), a solid follow up (The Eminem Show), and hell, even an Oscar (8 Mile). Then comes the addiction, the legal troubles, and, ultimately, the music suffers.     \\"It's different, them last two albums didn't count  Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing em out\\"  -Eminem, \\"Talkin' to Myself\\"    The release of Encore denoted two departures for Em from his previous albums, the first obviously being quality. While there were a few outstanding tracks, the rest were subpar to the point of being comical. Not Slim Shady comical, mind you. There were outdated pop-culture references, his lyrics descended into nonsensical ranting, and there was the debut of THAT. You know what I mean. The accent. That new device of his was unappealing and made the songs he used it on almost unlistenable.  It was an overall weak effort.    The second departure was an important one: listener detachment. Beyond his stellar wordplay and ruthlessness when taking on pop culture and society as a whole, Em had the ability to draw the listener in and relate to his lyrics. What resulted was an emotional reaction from the listener and an appeal that went beyond catchy punch lines.  He started it on the SSLP with \\"If I Had...\\" and \\"Rock Bottom\\", improved it on the MMLP with \\"Stan\\" and \\"The Way I Am\\", and perfected it on TES with \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\", \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", and \\"Hailie's Song\\". He had the ability to draw you into his world. This wasn't the case with Encore.     Everyone gets one though, right? Right. Unfortunately, Em's next album was the travesty known as \\"Relapse\\". \\"Relapse\\" was a shallow, emotionally devoid, accent-laden mess. The only redeeming factor was it had the song \\"Beautiful\\", which I feel is one of his best songs to date. It was kind of a shock to the system for long-time fans. I was even in denial for a while. I sort of liked some of it at first, but it got epically worse with each listen. It wasn't looking good for Em, or his fans.    Enter Recovery.     What makes Recovery so good is that it's so unlike an Eminem album but also so much like the old Eminem at the same time. At first glance, the featured artists and producers may make you balk (as well they should), but don't let it deter you. As silly as it sounds, this is absolutely the most mainstream sounding album that Eminem has ever released. The beats will make a large chunk of the tracks on this album radio hits easily. That's not a bad thing, though, as Em's verses hold down the beats and add his punch and attitude to them. It's an odd combo, but it works remarkably well. The fact that it sounds so much like a Pop/Rap crossover album is actually pretty ironic considering his past.    The first track is a sort of a Slim Shady-esque throwback type of track. Honestly, it sounds like a song that could stylistically fit on Relapse, but it's of a MUCH higher quality than the majority of that album. It may put you off if you didn't know better. The second track, \\"Talkin' to Myself feat. Kobe\\", is the first of many introspective tracks on the album and is the first big sign that this is no Relapse 2. Not only does he openly admit he was so jealous of more popular current artists (specifically Wayne and Kanye) that he almost wrote diss tracks about them, but he also apologizes to his fans for the garbage he's put out in recent years.    \\"I've come to make it up to you now no more ******* around  I've got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I let em down\\"  -Eminem, \\"Talkin' to Myself\\"    The guest singers are Kobe, Rihanna, and Pink. Again, a bit off-putting but they each perform well and fit on their respective songs. I'm nota fan of Rihanna, but she sounds great here, and the content of \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" will probably stir up some controversy because of her recent history. The only guest rapper is Lil Wayne and, let's be honest, you get what you'd expect from him. Luckily, Em's verse on \\"No Love\\" picks up the cheesy sample and the weak guest and actually make it a pretty decent song.     There are no skits on the album, just a very short intro blended in with the first track. That's 17 straight songs, and although some are better than others, there are really no stinkers. He's introspective (Talkin' to Myself). He discusses his addiction to pills and how it almost killed him (Going Through Changes). He's inspirational (Not Afraid). He talks about his experiences in underground battles, losing, and being discovered by Dre (Almost Famous). He even dips into braggadocio (So Bad). He also switches his flow up a bit on several tracks. On some songs he sounds like the track is off of SSLP, some from MMLP, and others from Relapse.     \\"Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, **** the words  You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker\\"  -Eminem, \\"Cold Wind Blows\\"    The poppy/mainstream beats are going to definitely turn away some listeners. I'm as detached from the mainstream as you can be, having withdrawn into the hip hop underground, so I can see fans wanting harder hitting beats. Some of them may be a bit bland, and I really will never be a fan of that pesky snare roll, but they aren't the make or break of the album. Some of them are quite good, actually. The real focus here, though, is his lyrics.    Recovery is not groundbreaking, but it is a very solid album. It's witty, introspective, and retains that signature ability of Em's to draw you in emotionally. It's clear he's fully invested himself in this album emotionally, mentioning the death of his best friend Proof several times while recollecting his recent troubles. \\"You're Never Over\\" is actually a tribute tothe late D12 member. He sounds sincere in his want to make it up to his fans for sticking with him through the tough times, as evidenced in the outstanding lead single \\"Not Afraid\\".    \\"And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back  I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact  Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was \\"ehhhh\\"  Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground  Relax, I ain't going back to that now\\"  -Eminem, \\"Not Afraid\\"    Eminem is back. If you're open-minded about the beats, you'll surely enjoy this album. Artists evolve. They can't stay the way you want them to be. When they do, you get things like Encore and Relapse. Eminem is evolving. It's time for his fans to do the same.    4/5    PS: There is NO accent on this album. In case anyone was wondering....
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my two granddaughters (ages 4 and 3) before we took them to the Broadway Play.  They loved the DVD, watch it continuously and go around the house singing both \\"It's a Hard Knock Life\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\".

0143113100|5.0|This is one of my two favorite books.  I am a vocational rehabilitation counselor and feel that the book has taught me things I didn't know about what is possible for my consumers with a head injury or stroke.  Also, I think it is a good book for teachers or parents, as it explains why learning, practicing, imagining etc. are good for children.  All the research that has been done is very interesting to read about.  The main lesson is the development of neurons by thinking, whether the thinking is positive or negative.  So thinking actually creates more neurons in that area of the brain.  I'm actually reading it the second time.
B003FMTZOM|2.0|I'm a fan of all kinds of music and a longtime Christina fan, so I expected to enjoy her new album despite reading the criticisms of its electronica focus. It turns out, the reviewers who've commented before me aren't wrong, even if you like hip-hop and electronica. Chrstina still has her gorgeous voice of course, but I'm really not sure what she was thinking on this one. It's not so much that she couldn't settle on a style, but that each style wasn't done well. And the other reviewers are completely on target when they point out that you can't even tell it's Christina singing 3/4s of the time. What's the point of listening to so-so songs with a so-so voice, when we could have the real Christina? Also, I don't think I liked the lyrics on any of the songs on this entire album. Particularly Woohoo, which I believe is the next single from this album. The music itself is so-so, but the lyrics are just plain raunchy. The other songs' lyrics weren't much better, either. I'm sorry I paid for this album, but since I did, I'll give it a few more listens. I'll post an update if my opinion changes, though I doubt it will.

B003RNU8KY|5.0|Let me begin by saying The Roots are refreshing in the world of Hip Hop not only because they're an actual band, but because they've grown and matured over time musically and lyrically.  Some Hip Hoppers claim that they are grown and mature yet still rap about how great they are and all the money they have (see Jay-Z), but The Roots frontman (Black Thought) actually writes about things that a mature person living in American society thinks about.  Topics range from the ecosystem to living responsibly to hoping that his daughter grows up to be more than the average consumer.  As far as the sequencing of the album goes, this is a very cohesive listen.  The song kind of build into an ultimate climax right before the final track.  If you're a fan of not only Hip Hop but music in general, this is THE album to have this year.  This is one amazing musical journey.  It's one of those albums that's going down in history as one of the greats when it's all said and done.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|What a great album! This album exceeds my expectations. These guys are so creative, I'm so glad they put this out. I'm constantly finding myself singing lyrics to different songs throughout the day. Devo writes songs that aren't all mamby-pamby like other bands... the lyrics have meaning... they make you think. They take music to another level....    Thank you, Devo!!

Chet Baker could play melody on the trumpet like no other. I also like his vocals even though his voice is not what it was when he played and sang with Jerry Mulligan.  We lost a great talent way to young.  Thanks goodness for recordings and video so we can go no appreciating Chet.

Almost all of the songs on this album have become staples on classic rock radio stations and it's pretty obvious why.

0525423842|3.0|\\"The hope of the righteous will be gladness,<br />But the expectation of the wicked will perish.\\" -- Proverbs 10:28 (NKJV)<br /><br />Have you ever read a book about a young person who practices law without a license? I haven't. I wasn't quite sure what to expect because the strictures on what a teen can do legally are pretty extreme.<br /><br />Forget that you've read other books by John Grisham that are filled with really disgusting criminals, overwhelming risk, mind-boggling thrills and action, and unexpected twists and turns. If you expect a book like that, forget Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer. It's not that kind of book. Erase all memories of The Client in this regard.<br /><br />I found TB:KL to be mostly about explaining the law to the 9-12 set. As such, it wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but someone who wants to pick up a little legal understanding amid a story about a murder trial will probably find that this is more fun than reading a non-fiction book.<br /><br />I found myself comparing this book with To Kill a Mockingbird, which I read when I was a young teen. While that book was very engrossing, filled with heart-pounding scenes, TB:KL is more like a book from the fifties where the kids are smarter than the parents, the parents have no idea what's going on, and everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about TB:KL is that the ending strongly suggests a sequel, one that could have some of the normal Grisham thrills in it. One can only hope at this point.<br /><br />If I had handed this book to any of my children at ages 9-12, I doubt if they would have finished it. And they had an above-average interest in the law.
B0036EH3X4|1.0|The final season of Lost wasn't just a letdown in its own right (although it was). It also betrayed the narrative of the much-beloved five seasons which preceded it. The problem is not just the lack of answers to the Island's mysteries -- although that lack of answers rankled -- but the fact that almost none of the events of the show prior to the last four episodes had any meaning or impact. For instance, the destruction of the hatch in the Season 2 finale never had any ramifications or explanations or consequences. Similarly, the explosion of the nuke in Season 5 ultimately proved to have no impact on the conclusion (despite an overlong and narratively unfair tease). Desmond's flashes -- built up throughout and made to look significant toward the end -- also completely failed to impact the actual conclusion of the show. In short, the \\"man behind the curtain\\" was revealed in the closing hours of Lost, and his secret was that the show had not actual plot at all. It was just a series of random events in which actions and character choices never had any consequences.
0385339682|3.0|I really wanted to love this...his books are usually so good. The beginning started off great, just like his old thrillers. Then the middle third drifted off into character portraits. But the ending....SPOILER ALERT....blaming violent crimes on a mentally ill man?? Cheap trick.
1439153663|1.0|I think that if you are looking for a book about life in the South, the Help is much, much better. I found this book tedious and boring. I gave up half way through.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I really like this album, but it took several days of listening repeatedly before I felt this way. Some songs got me the first time, others took a while. On the other hand, I loved the entire Mudcrutch and Wildflowers albums on the first listen. Still, I like that Tom is willing to take chances on new material that may not be what the Damn the Torpedoes fans want. I look at every album as unique and that allows me to enjoy it without trying to compare it with others. The bottom line is I enjoy listening to it and that's what really count. Well done Tom!
B003RNXIBK|5.0|I have been waiting for this since the Eminem Show. You can tell by listening to album that he has put passion into it. There no substitute for passion or experience, and they are both present on this album. I like the fact that it's the most serious album he has put out, and it should be. By the time I got half way though the 2nd track I knew it was going to be good, but by the end of the album it was obvious that this is Eminem's Best Work.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I have to say anyone who truly hated the series finale of lost didn't seem to understand it.  It it would have been completely lame if they just came out and answered every question point blank.  Besides, every important question was answered throughout the series; maybe you need to watch it again if you didn't catch that.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This CD is pretty much a masterpiece. Take the feeling you get when you listen to an Eminem CD and you get to a song like Sing for the Moment or Beautiful and think \\"wow, this is the best song on the CD,\\" and realize that on Recovery, almost every single track is one of these. It's amazing how incredible almost all of these songs are. Though there are a couple \\"weaker\\" songs here, not a single one of them is bad. Eminem's flow and his lyrics are at the absolute top. He fell off in a major way with Encore, Relapse I thought was a return to form, (though Eminem didn't, apparently) but with Recovery I can say for sure that the troubled hip hop artist is now back at the top of his game with what's easily his most inspiring and uplifting CD to date.    Production-wise, though I prefer Dre's simpler beats, (he only handles 1 track,) some incredible songs are crafted here, and some of the choruses are out of this world.    Relapse was simply for the fans: Recovery is a CD that fans will not only love, but even people who haven't been big fans in the past will be able to love many of the songs on this follow-up.    On a final note, in the Relapse CD booklet, Eminem said he couldn't pick a song to dedicate to his recently-killed friend, Proof, since none would possibly be good enough. On Recovery, he created a song that he felt was good enough, and You're Never Over is sure enough one of the most powerful and heartfelt I've ever heard from him. Incredible stuff.    I had my doubts going in: a small part of me misses the skits with Eminem's famous characters, and his alter ego, Slim Shady, seems to be on his way to retirement. The decision to feature guests like Rhianna, Lil Wayne, (who proves he actually can rap if he tries, who'd have thought?) and Pink, as well as what I knew would be much more jazzed up production, also worried me a bit. But these fears were put to rest as I listened to this CD, and I was just left speechless at the end of it; a work that may go down as Eminem's best.
0375429743|5.0|The book was awesome, it helped in everyway. It shows exactly how to answer the actual ibt internet based test. It was sent in great condition and the price was ok.
0393072231|5.0|Lewis has the most amazing gift for characterization. To me that is the absolute genius of this book - the way he describes the background and quirky personalities of a handful of short traders he has chosen to profile. The dialogue is priceless as you follow them to the various high finance meetings they attend. You reach a point where you can almost predict what they are going to say. Despite the fact that some of them do some things that are probably not ethical, they are quite a colorful band of rogues - whose motivation, for the most part, seems to have been quite noble. They are all extremely colorful and gifted and you can't wait to turn to the next page to see what they will do next. Although his writing style is much different, Lewis clearly has the same gift for off beat, quirky characters as William Faulkner.<br /><br />Obviously everyone knows what happens at the end - the market crashes. However there is a real sense of drama as you wonder whether our heroes will go down with it - or get out of their risky holdings in time (I am a pure romantic and never dreamed I would ever make such a comment about a non-fiction book regarding high finance).<br /><br />Lewis has a gift for explaining exactly what credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations are - and how people make - and lose - money on them. And how a lot of innocent people at the credit ratings agencies have been blamed for giving this junk Triple A ratings - when it's clear that the traders at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were deliberatley packaging their bonds so that nobody could tell whether the mortgage loans they contained were risky or not.<br /><br />Reading THE BIG SHORT makes me angrier than ever about the TARP bailouts, as it makes clear billions of dollars went to the speculative traders who were reponsible for the crash but who no longer work on Wall Street - money that US taxpayers will never see again because it represented a lot of speculative (fictitious) wealth that never really existed except on paper.<br /><br />Dr Stuart Bramhall, author THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACTexcept on paper.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|If there's one thing that can be said about Eminem, it's that he's honest; at least when it comes to his opinions.  On Recovery, many of the opinions he expresses are about his previous work.  Reintroducing himself with the words \\"cause some things just don't change, it's better when they stay the same,\\" Eminem hints at a return to the hard-hitting lyrics and solid beats that made him famous.  His previous two records, Encore and Relapse were met with mixed reviews and left many fans disappointed, in part thanks to the bar being set so high with albums like The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP.<br /><br />Recovery continues with \\"Talkin' 2 Myself,\\" Eminem's look back on his state of mind between his last album and now.  This is one of the first times Eminem acknowledges the talent his competition has.  \\"I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne,\\" he says.  \\"It's like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin'.\\"  Although two verses of self-loathing would be enough to turn many fans away, the triumphant return is worth the wait.  \\"It's different, them last two albums didn't count.  Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing `em out.  I've come to make it up to you...Let me formally reintroduce myself.\\"  Yes, Eminem has returned.<br /><br />Eminem maintains energy reminiscent of his early work through the tracks \\"On Fire,\\" \\"Won't Back Down,\\" and \\"W.T.P.,\\" before a sample of Ozzy's cry \\"I'm going through changes\\" from the Black Sabbath song \\"Changes\\" sets a more serious tone.  Eminem clearly has something to prove and while the first five tracks are solid, \\"Going Through Changes\\" makes a clear statement that he is still the one to beat.<br /><br />The first single off Recovery, \\"Not Afraid,\\" falls at an odd point on the album, almost halfway though, but it remains equally catchy and powerful.  Instead of falling back on Auto-Tune or recycled beats, like many of his competitors have done in recent years, Eminem turns a new page, occasionally enlisting some A-List talent for support.  Between Rihanna's soulful voice soaring on \\"Love The Way You Lie,\\" Lil Wayne's unique vocals on \\"No Love\\" and Dr. Dre's distinctive beats on \\"So Bad,\\" Eminem isn't afraid to ask for a hand rising back to the top.<br /><br />After gradually falling apart since 2002, Recovery finds Eminem more confident than he has been in years, and rightfully so.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Honestly I didn't think Relapse was that bad. However, there were a few tracks that actually annoyed me to the point where I skipped over them. This CD brings me back to the good Eminem days. The days of The Marshall Mathers LP (which is still number 1 in my book). Serious raw tracks, excellent flows, emotion, and very little joking. Eminem has so much talent it was getting wasted on the jokey tracks.  I definitely think he is back and he is here to stay.
B003K025V4|4.0|This is actually a really well produced, and written album. As with most albums it has a few duds, but mostly contains catchy little pop songs that seem to be channelling Ke$ha in some parts. But I digress.  One song manages to actually MAKE the entire album. If you're not one who usually likes Miley Cyrus music but, like me, has followed her this past year due to hits such as \\"Party in the USA\\" and \\"When I Look At You\\", you might be delighted to know that there are a few memorable songs here. Personally though, I'm still in awe at the Beatles-esque catchy tune-and-a-half, entitled: \\"Forgiveness and Love\\". It's one of the most original songs I've heard in years. I am not a fan of dance remixes, or anything that is usually in the top 100, so this came as quite a shock to me because I like a catchy melody that goes places instead of ones that sit in the same spot and bases its existence purely on the familiarity of repetitiveness. Plus it's not a song that is about sex and drugs or waking up and brushing your teeth with alcohol. Also, it does not contain any of those awful techno beats and auto-tuning (something she unfortunately makes up for with the rest of the album). For anyone reading who knows exactly what I'm talking about, \\"Forgiveness and Love\\" is an actual original song. So like I mentioned, it alone makes the album worthwhile.
B000007NZ5|5.0|Musically, this is one of the best and solid albums I've ever heard - a masterpiece from Tony & friends. And that, to me, renders everything else barely relevant. It comes really close to make it into my personal list of timeless masterpieces of rock, such as:     \\"Rainbow Rising\\" and    \\"Long Live Rock'n'Roll\\" from Rainbow,    \\"Wish You Were Here\\" from Pink Floyd,    \\"Hair of The Dog\\" by Nazareth,    \\"Defenders of The Faith\\" by Judas Priest,    \\"Holy Diver\\" by Dio,    \\"Brave New World\\" from Iron Maiden,   \\"Promised Land\\" from Queensryche,   and, of course,    \\"Heaven & Hell\\" and   \\"Mob Rules\\" by Sabbath with Great Dio (R.I.P.)    Otherwise, one can say that lyrics are corny, but... Fellows! These are the \\"Theme\\" lyrics! Just close your eyes and then listen. Don't be surprised if you suddenly find yourself in the middle of  abandoned cemetery in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere,  and somewhere in the depths of Time! Do you see that silver moon casting, through the mist, an eery silver light on the somber monuments of stone, otherwise, cloaked in the dark shadows? Can you see, feel, and smell a PURITY of it? I would rather be there than in the middle of some filthy noisy downtown. Of course, not everyone was dished out imagination by Creator, and some love downtown, but for those like me - a perfect world to get lost for a while and feel good again. Isn't it what Metal is all about - to heal our wounds? Reality sucks anyway. Definitely 5 stars from me.

B000000QFV|3.0|A cool album (love \\"Anno Mundi\\" and \\"The Sabbath Stones\\"), but has some \\"cracks\\" and \\"gaps\\" here and there (as a whole album). Headless Cross is better, much more solid. My opinion.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is crazy. It is extremely fun if you like strategy games. It's like combining monopoly and risk, then shortening the gameplay down to about 30 min to an hour, and adding some extra awesome to it. I love this game. It takes a little while to set up but it's totally worth it.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|this cd is different but it is so hard i mean pure hip hop at its finest real heads go get this!
B00000J7RZ|5.0|i remember the latin explosion era...it was when marc anthony, enrique iglesias, and ricky martin were at their peak. j. lo was the only successful female out of the bunch. to be honest, i never really cared for her when i saw the \\"if you had my love\\" video back then. i would always see them playing that video on vh-1. i would get annoyed and changed the channel. but that all changed when i saw her \\"waiting for tonight\\" video. i love that song! she was so hot back then. she had a really cute style. i love her diamond stud earrings and seems like a very happy person who enjoys her life. that's what i like about her. now about \\"on the 6\\", it was her best cd she has ever put out and it was her best era. i consider it one of my favorite j. lo cds along with \\"this is me...then\\". the cd has a beautiful mixture of salsa, hip hop, ballads, and pop. nearly all the songs are good. i'm particularly fond of her ballads. they are very beautiful, innocent, sultry, sweet, and romantic. i love \\"it's not that serious\\" and \\"promise me you'll try\\". she may not have the strongest voice, but she does sound nice. this cd is definately a keeper!
B003KUSUG8|4.0|this is what em brings to the table. the guy is legit and creative. the beats are different this time as they arent produced by dre himself but other producers. ems flow fits well with other producers. go get it and support real real hip hop!

1423101472|5.0|Right now, I am practically worshipping Rick Riordan.     Rick Riordan took my childhood love for Greek mythology and brilliantly interwoven it with action, romance, and adventure! (HOW COULD YOU RESIST?) I bawled, took out my ice cream, sat there at my desk rereading my favorite scenes of The Last Olympian by Rick Riordan and cried some more until my eyes were swollen, puffy and excrutiatingly unattractive for a night-out that day.     I love how Riordan creates a character with strong trust, and loyalty foundations.    PERCY JACKSON is officially one of my all-time favorite heroes.

B000FDECGA|5.0|A defective samurai and his infant son must battle their way through hordes of ninjas and enemy warriors on the path to destroy their evil shogun leader. SHOGUN ASSASSIN is blood-soaked Japanese cinema at its best, taking the classic samurai Action/Adventure premise and pushing it to the limits of extreme violence and gore. The Americanized version of the film released in 1980 is actually an amalgamation of the first and second films from the LONE WOLF AND CUB series, removing much of the slower exposition from each in order to increase the rapid-fire action sequences. Wakayama's stern, calculated performance as the vengeful Ogami is one of the film's greatest strengths, lending credibility to the role even after much of the character's background had been stripped away. SHOGUN'S exaggerated comic book framing and fight choreography make every fight fresh and engaging, while the geysers of blood, severed heads, and flying limbs make this the perfect stepping stone to draw Horror purists into the excessive world of Asian action and gore that would inspire filmmakers like Quentin Tarentino for decades to follow.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I must say that when I first heard these songs a few weeks back before the album was released I was simply floored. Every single one of these tracks is amazing. Most people by this time in their careers have faded away or just keep putting out garbage. Well Marshall was on that same track as of late until he crafted this almost Perfect 17 track album that shows us how he has been feeling lately. It tells tales of his life dealing with career, drugs, death of his closet friend and more. This doesn't have all the crazy antics of past albums, this is just pure, from the heart, well written lyrics. He shows us his inner demons and takes us on a well recorded journey. Some of these songs are in my opinion in his top ten since he first started rapping. I would recommend checking out No Love and Love the Way you Lie as 2 stand out tracks. I think \\"25 to Life\\" is the best track on the album, and \\"Almost Famous\\" would be my close second favorite. I recommend purchasing this album, it will be worth every cent you paid for it, I have listened to it since the leak 2 weeks ago and now that I got the Cd close to 30 times already, and can see myself actually listening to this album years from now no problem. This is a classic and it just cam e out.
0743289692|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone, especially those who live in a western society and may never have to experience the shocking reality of true Islam.

This book had a huge impact on my life because it gave me a new perspective on true Islam and religion in general.

B002ITB3PM|5.0|Two hapless and awkward New Zealanders move to New York City to try and strike it big as musicians as well as try to get a few girls in between gigs.  The humor is incredibly dead pan and the delivery often monotone, which makes the jokes even more laughable.   The songs spread throughout the show are never short of hilarious as well as excellently crafted.  They truly are musicians with a knack for creating a catchy beat and lyrics both absurd and comedic.  You could listen to the songs without even watching the show and have a grand enough time.  Songs such as \\"Business Time\\" with lines like \\"I move very very clumsily, tripping sensously over my pants\\" sung in a deep Barry White tone and \\"Most Beautiful Girl\\" with \\"And when you're on the street, depending on the street, I bet you could be, in the top three most beautiful girls on the street...depending on the street\\" make the show unique and genuinely funny.  One of the best shows that was ever on television.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Saw the movie at an IMAX theatre and the result is nothing short of terrific. So many people are negative complaining about the unoriginal story (Its Cameron cmon) the stale dialogue ( Its Cameron cmon) but the awesome 3-d technology (Its Cameron cmon) the great action/battle scenes and of course the not so suttle dances with wolves story. This is a popcorn movie so cmon dont be so bitchy people. A great film destined to become a legend in the history of filmdom. Also it was great to see those gung ho killing machine marines get it in the end. They got what they were dishing out-loved seeing the colonel gutted in the finale. Fantastic flick.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|No skits No silly single No crazy video JUst raw beats ill lyrics and a dope flow! This is to me a mixture of the Marshal mathers LP and Eminem Show days.The production is loaded with rock samples and he finnally releases all his built up emotion about the death of bast friend and D12 leader Proof. This is by far better than the last 2 albums and ranks just as high if not higher than his best 2 albums. If your a Em fan you will love this cd hands down. If you are a hater who doubts his abiltys and your a hip hop fan this cd will blow your mind! Great Great album !
B002QGSW8I|4.0|This is an entertaining book but I'm just tired of the Sigma novels. The characters good and the stories are nice but it's just too generic now. Ever since The Da Vinci Code became such a huge hit the market has been flooded with historical fiction books. Rollins jumped on the bandwagon and created Sigma. It has boosted his popularity but I still like his stand alone first 4 novels way more. This book is no different from all the other Dan Brown look-a-likes out there. The first scene even has a priest getting killed in a church and branded with a historical mark. The rest of the book is the standard clue hunting search that takes the reader to many historical sites but this has all been done before. With that said the story is enjoyable and the writing is good but I just feel like nothing really new was brought to the table here. Good book/series for people who love Dan Brown's style but if you are looking for something different this is not it.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|*Minor spoilers*    Storytelling-wise, this was the weakest season of all. Some of the previous seasons may have started slow (like Season 3) but the story always picks up toward the end. What we have for season 6 is a choppy, uneven narrative with too many characters, major and minor, fighting for screen time. At times, the pace is too chaotic; key events feel rushed and certain subplots are hastily concluded. Other times, the action stalls; all we see is one group of people going from point A to point B while another group is going from point C to point D. The problem of the pacing can be attributed to the fact that too much time was spent on two plot elements: (1) The Sideways Universe (2)Explaining the Jacob v MIB conflict.    I admit some stories in the sideways universe were interesting. And the sideways universe was necessary for the setup of the happy reunion scene in the finale. However, a substantial amount of time had to be devoted to a universe that essentially was not real. The inclusion of the sideways/afterlife universe disrupted the pacing of the story in the real timeline. This was not a problem with the flashbacks and flashforwards in previous seasons since the viewers could see the connection between the flashes and the present timeline. But we were not aware of the the connection between the two timelines for season 6 until the very end, so for most of the season, it felt like two separate stories were being told in every episode. Sure the reunion scene in the finale was very moving, but does the payoff at the end justify the disruption of the flow of the overall narrative?    Another problem was that the writers waited until the very end of season 5 to reveal the whole Jacob v MIB conflict. So they needed a lot of time this season to set up the story and explain the origins of the two beings and the nature of the conflict and the \\"rules\\" of the game and the candidates and how this relates to the island, etc. They even used one whole episode (\\"Across the Sea\\") to try to explain the mythology, which ended up not being too informative at all. I felt too much information was being crammed, and like the sideways universe, it had a detrimental effect on the flow of the narrative. At the very least they could have revealed parts of the Jacob/MIB story in season 5 to avoid this problem.     My other complaint was how the story arcs of certain characters were concluded in a very unsatisfactory manner. My two biggest disappointments: Claire and Richard Alpert. If we exclude Claire's appearances in the sideways universe (which essentially is just a \\"flashback\\" to the old Claire we've seen in season 1), then the only thing memorable about her character for this season is her crazy hairdo. The whole \\"insane Claire\\" seemed promising at the beginning but failed to deliver. By the end she was simply reduced to a bystander in a lot of scenes. Why did the MIB want to recruit her anyway?    And then we have Richard Alpert. A mysterious character we've seen in previous seasons that seemed to know a lot of secrets of the island. Well, it turns out that he does not really know anything. He spent the first half of the season running around in panic after learning that Jacob was dead; at one point he even tried to commit suicide. Then after calming down a bit, his objective for the rest of the season was to \\"destroy the Ajira plane.\\" And he did not even accomplish that. So what was the purpose of his character for this season? Or the entire series? I admit the Richard-centric episode was well done, but if that's all Richard has to contribute to this series, then why create his character in the first place?
0062009540|4.0|I put off reading Pretty Little Liars for a while because I assumed it'd be like the Gossip Girl series. Now, I'm kicking myself for not picking it up sooner, especially since it doesn't seem as trashy, for lack of a better word, as the Gossip Girl books, though I have read and enjoyed those as well. While I could definitely see the similarities, I think Pretty Little Liars has more going for it, plotwise, than that of Gossip Girl.<br /><br />Pretty Little Liars hooked me right from the beginning. The mood was set almost immediately. I've mentioned this before, but I've always said that the way to hook a reader is to keep them intrigued as to the outcome of the ending. I was intrigued throughout the whole book. I was dying to know what each girl's secret was. Dying to know about the \\"Jenna thing\\", what exactly happened to Alison, and who the hell was sending those mysterious text messages. Unfortunately, we don't get much answers in this book (hence why I took away the one star) since I tend to get annoyed at books that keep me reading with the mysteries yet doesn't resolve not one of them (which was my biggest gripe with Michael Grant's Gone, but this one was significantly shorter so not as big of a deal). But I guess the purpose is to make sure you read the Pretty Little Liars sequel.<br /><br />When it comes to the four main characters directly, I was happy to notice that I liked them all. Aria wasn't annoying with the whole teacher affair and that kind of crap does tend to annoy me (especially since it's so overused), but while I didn't have a problem with her, she really was my least favorite character. I just didn't care about her problems as much as the other girls. I completely bought Emily's struggle with her identity and trying to be herself even though her parents wanted her to be more like them. Hanna was the one that I had assumed I'd dislike the most, but she was the one that displayed the most vulnerability out of all the characters and her whole thing with her feeling replaced by her father was so sad. Now, Spencer was the one I identified most with since she is an overachiever and so am I. Her issues with her parents and her sister had me visibly cringing especially when everything unraveled.<br /><br />Pretty Little Liars was an extremely enjoyable read. There weren't any cardboard cut-out characters and the girls problems seemed very real. The book was also a real page-turner, I literally finished it in one sitting. The fact that this book was set up specifically to have more things solved in the sequel (maybe, maybe not) did grate a little, but it wasn't too bad. I have read the sneak peek of the next book and I'm hoping it really doesn't turn out like Gossip Girl with \\"A\\" actually referring to the \\"audience\\"/readers. I swear if these notes start to end with \\"xoxo...Gossip Girl\\" or something towards that effect, I'm so out.ling replaced by her father was so sad.

B000JML7EC|5.0|What an unexpected surprise, I downloaded the Kindle App for my iPod Touch and since this book is public domain, it was a free download.  I had never read this book (can't believe it, 55 and I never read it) ... well, not only is the Kindle on the iPod a very nice app the book is outstanding.  Now, I much prefer reading any book on the Kindle, I wish the electronic price would come down a bit as the cost of printing and shelf space is not a factor, if it were, I'd buy all my books on Kindle.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I'm not much for writing reviews but after reading a few on here, there is an aspect nobody seems to get.  Multiple songs on here are metaphors for Eminem and Hip-Hop.  If you listen to these songs with this focus in mind, you'll clearly see the metaphors.    Seduction:  This songs talks about how the rap game (referred to as she) is loving him right now.  A song basically saying how he is better than most others in rap right now.    25 To Life:  This song is about how he will be with rap for the rest of his life.  \\"she\\" being rap game has taken his freedom, didn't give him due respect so he is going to take control now, put his full effort from now on.    Love the Way You Lie:  This song talk about how he can't leave the rap game even if he hasn't always been treated with the respect he deserves.  Even though he has tried to leave it, he keeps coming back to rap.    He has made it clear he is proud of metaphors and similies he has put in this cd, and it is definitely full of them.  Some songs are metaphors in themselves, and some such as won't back down are just filled with them.

B0000696I1|2.0|This is actually the very first time I've seen \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III\\", which is amazing since I was a Ninja Turtles nut as a kid. I simply never had the opportunity to see it...and thank goodness I never did until now. It's incredibly underwhelming and overbearingly silly. What's obvious to most people who saw the film, the time travel premise doesn't seem very suited for a Ninja Turtles movie. The fans watch it for the turtles, the foot soldiers, villains like Shredder, and horrible puns. All this movie had are the horrible puns, and this movie has more one-liners than it does fights.<br /><br />No one wanted to see the turtles go back to the Edo period and fight forgettable daimyos and pirates, but that's what this plot is. The turtles just happened to mess around when April arrived and just happened to acquire a plot device that just happened to magically switch their places with the historic figures from 400 years ago. April just happened to find Casey's ancestor, the Turtles just happened to get involved with the rebel faction, and the bad guy just happened to be in the middle of a deal to trade guns for gold for the evil king. The forces of nature sure works in convenient ways.  Here's a question: how come their clothes are switched when time traveling but objects like the Walkman stay with them?  Is that just so the samurai can see the Walkman and smash it into pieces ina so-called humorous gag?<br /><br />The few fights it had, they were pretty unexciting, and too much time is spend on the cast causing a ruckus, not worrying about the consequences of time-traveling. Casey and Splinter are there for, well, being there, and the Japanese soldiers being sent to the present don't take much advantage of their surroundings (except for hockey). The more I watched it, the more I felt detached with what's going on.  Although this movie wasn't good, I can't say the rest of the theatrical TMNT movies were stellar.  In fact, the only great TMNT movie I've seen was [[ASIN:B003Q7B742 a made-for-TV special by 4Kids]]. Talk about unreal.3Q7B742 a made-for-TV special by 4Kids]]. Talk about unreal.
B002R68U7K|3.0|This Multi-Box is great, is wonderfull with all the cd singles taken together, and I appreciate that the 'Overprotected' includes both single mixes of the song: international Album Version & US Darkchild Remix. However there are too many b-sides in these discs and many of them are available also in the albums, especially in the latest 2003's editions of the albums remastered with bonus tracks: songs like Deep In My Heart, Thinking About You, Autumn Goodbye, I'll Never Stop Loving You are just available in ...BABY ONE MORE TIME [16tracks - 2003 Enhanced CD]. Heart is in OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN [15tracks - 2003 CD]. I Run Away is in BRITNEY [15tracks - 2003 Enhanced CD] and also Everybody and Gimme More (Paul Oakenfold Remix) are just in the BLACKOUT [16tracks JPN CD] so in this Multi-Box there are many useless tracks and it was better to put only remixes in each cd single and not b-sides at all!  Also the DVD is not very great: the audio-level is law: you can ear that in the previous Britney's DVDs the audio is higher than in this; and also I don't like the 'Piece Of Me' US Video that is in here: I love the scenes of the international video and hate those of the US; for not talking of the incredible absence of some wonderfull Britney's videos, like Overprotected, Boys (Co-Ed Remix), Outrageous and the newest 3: just the latest 3 should have been in this DVD!! Why it isn't it?!???

B003KUSUG8|5.0|We all go through a certain route in our career where we get stuck in the same routine. The reason could be due to conflict in personal life or the need to take a step back from ones love. Eminem's track \\"25 to Life\\" is a perfect example of this and for me personally one of his best tracks off his new album. Eminem breaks loose with his album Recovery. He steps out of his usual element of rapping which we saw with Encore/Relapse and goes back to the art of it. It is nice to see Eminem come back and I'm loving the new album. Listened to Eminem since he first appeared on the scene and it has been awesome to see how he has progressed over the years.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|The premise of Capitalism is that the economic system we thought was an integral and benign part of the American culture of our youth has mutated into something which that is actually preying on us rather than serving or working with us.  Moore looks at a number of different  brought on by American \\"industry\\" including the creation of a virtual ghosttown out of Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan; the exploitation of employee deaths through the use of \\"dead peasant\\" insurance policies; and finally the near economic collapse brought about the the banksters.  Moore closes the film by asserting that we all must take action if we want to rein in American capitalism so that it once more serves the common good rather than the wealthy oligarchy.    Occasionally, Moore goes a bit over the top with teary-eyed testimony by some of the victims and his \\"theater\\" of attempting to retrieve the taxpayer's bailout money from the banksters is a bit silly.  However, on the whole it is an interesting and thoughtful piece that makes its argument without being overly strident; I tend to get turned off with the hard-sell that some advocates use to advance their position but this fell below my threshold (YMMV).  If you aren't a die-hard supporter of an unfettered free market then this film may cause you to think a bit about our current economic system; if you are a true-believer in the way things currently work then the film will provide an incredible wealth of material to use in your future fulminations.
0811870987|4.0|Hundreds of pages of beautiful \\"photos\\" of birds on white backgrounds. From the other comments I was expecting photographs with incredible detail. Instead they look like photos that were edited in Photoshop with the watercolor and pencil effects. As photographs they are somewhat flat, 2D, and suffer from artifice. However, if you like the drawings in the birding books you'll love Bird, because that's exactly what you get. You can see what the images look like on the Amazon page for the book, in the section labeled \\"Take a Closer Look: Selected Photographs from Bird.\\" They are beautiful, they just aren't photographic in appearance.

B001FB55I0|5.0|After seeing this film in theaters I immediately drew a comparison to Blade Runner.  That film was released at a time where critics complained about the lack of a strong narrative and not enough substance.  I think this film befell a similar fate and was widely dismissed upon release.  Well I loved every minute of this film from the opening frame and waited over 6 months for the Blu-ray release.  This movie is not only highly entertaining but also touches upon the ideas that make us human.  I think after the Cristian Bale rant was somehow released a lot of the critics and audiences failed to appreciate his performance and considered this movie to be a mindless action film.  It's funny that the Transformers movie came out a little after this movie and was really panned (rightly so) for being a mindless exercise.  This film at least builds upon the previous mythology and creates several new interesting characters such as the Sam Worthington character who is only looking for a second chance.  At the end of the day I think in years to come this film will be given a second chance and will be appreciated for it's strong narrative, brilliant casting, wonderful cinematography, creative action scenes and strong direction.  Ever since the first Terminator film I have waited for another dark mythology driven fantasy of a future that is always a possibility.  We must never forget what makes us human.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Only tricky part for me was running the software for the com port conversion. The instruction were a little confusing.  Other than that, works great now.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Em just keeps out doing himself. everytime he comes out with a new album every song is great and the whole album is worth the listen.
B003HLM2QO|2.0|Ozzy(especially) with Black Sabbath is the lord of all things metal, or was at least. Scream his latest offering sees the 61 year old Prince Of Darkness taking a new heavier dark road, this may sound good correct? Well yes and no, mainly no. I've followed Gus G now for around 7 years and knew he was destine for greatness when i heard him with Firewind, more so than Dream Evil, so when i heard he teamed up with Ozz i was psyched. I heard the single Let Me Hear You Scream and thought hmm not bad sounds exactly like something from No More Tears which was a great thing. Oddly enough i realized Ozzy had somewhat lost his voice and it had a strange gruffness to it now and less of the Banshee we all know and love. Well after getting an early release of the album i popped it in, first song Let It Die kinda threw me for a loop with , I'm a Rock Star, I'm a Savior, I'm a Sinner, repeated way to many times. The chorus on that song is simply the best on the album, as for other chorus's i really didnt hear much in the way of those. Gus G fits, but doesnt if that makes sense, just because the album is \\"heavier\\" doesn't mean its going to be creative, and versatile which this album is not. Ozzy seems to sing in a monotone range which is probably to be expected after all the years of abuse to his body and voice, but heck even on the first Black Sabbath album his voice was like that. The main problem is that the album really has no direction, it just is. Nothing really catches your attention and draws you in with the usual haunted Ozzy songwriting and ghostly chorus's. With the exception of Diggin Me Down there really isn't any good riffs on the album and with a few fillers such as Crucify, Life Won't Wait and Time, the album just slowly dwindles down to a fading candle. So its hard for me to say it sucks, but its just not the Ozzy i wanted or expected, Gus G and Ozzy really don't gel that well, but i love his guitar playing but i think it was just a poor decision for him to join theband. Also i just think Ozzy and his crew are really running out of musical ideas which most band these days are. Some other albums that came out recently that are great and some that are sup par as well...........    Godsmack-Oracle-3/5  Nevermore-The Obsidian Conspiracy-5/5  Soulfly-Omen-5/5  Creed(2009)-2/5  Slash-4/5  Danzig-Red Deth Sabaoth-4/5  Exodus-The Atrocity Exhibition-4/5  Overkill-Iron Bound-4/5  Dream Theater(2009)-2/5  Vanden Plas-3/5  Masterplan-3/5    These are just some other Metal and Hard Rock albums i've gotten into the past year, or this year so far, some are worth checking out some aren't. Some keep the metal banner flying high some not so much. As far as Ozzy's album yes its heavy but just lacks that punch and chills up the back of my neck that i usually get from his albums. Oddly enough Black Rain at first i thought was awful then with a few more listens it got better, i just don't see that being the case here. Also if you noticed on Black Rain, Nightmare, Love to Hate and especially Trap Door were the 3 best songs on the album, and they were BONUS TRACKS! Go figure. But get this yourself and you be the judge, this is just my verdict.  2/5
0061537969|5.0|One of my friends, a non dog person, recommended this so I decided to take a chance.  I'm a dog lover and from the beginning I was sure I'd hate the ending - but it was absolutely a great read and I loved the ending.  Maybe I'm just a glass half full kind of person but you can't resist the insights of this animal and his trip through life until the end.  When I finished the book, it made me hope that life really ends like this.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|Early on, way before the release of \\"MOJO\\", I kept reading that this was going to a tribute to the Blues, in listening to it, there is just one song that could be called \\"blues\\", oh, there are songs that have maybe a guitar lick that might be called blues, but it's just a replay or rework of songs that have already come out on his previous disc's, I have got to say, a lot of the music here is very weak, hardly anything that will stick with you, I received it for Fathers Day, so not to hurt my youngsters feelings when they come over,I will leave it out, but I sure as h--- am not going to play it, well, I will play it for them.
030726999X|5.0|Larsson did it again.  He demonstrates a great eye for detail that adds to the complex suspense in all his three novels.  So sad that such a great writer will give us no more.  These were great characters that transcended the pages and became real people caught up in bizarre and complex situations.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|[[ASIN:B0021L8UPS Orphan]] was a movie that I'd heard about and was hesitant to watch.  I'm usually a sucker for the movies about orphans or abused children, and usually these things go hand-in-hand.<br /><br />From the hype, I knew that this child would be one of those with mental health issues.  From the descriptions on the sites, I suspected some kind of psychosis or deep antisocial disorder.  But what was revealed as the film leads us down this path of suspense was something I hadn't suspected.  Not once.<br /><br />The ending was so chilling that I literally couldn't sleep afterwards.  Warning!  Do not watch if you want to sleep.<br /><br />Vera Farmiga is compelling as Kate, the mother, who has suffered depression and a bout with alcoholism after their third child is stillborn.  Peter Sarsgaard portrays John, the husband, whom we soon learn has some fidelity issues, thus creating tension between the spouses.<br /><br />Isabelle Fuhrman, as Esther, steals the spotlight as the disturbed adopted daughter.  The other children are very compelling as well, and the movie creates the typical conspiracy of silence between them all, as Esther inspires fear and obedience from them.<br /><br />When Kate begins to suspect something is very wrong with Esther, she can't get her husband to even give credence to her concerns.  He brushes her off as if she's nothing.  I began to despise him early on for his cluelessness and his inability to see what was staring him in the face.<br /><br />In the end, though, everyone is a believer.  And not to give away the surprises, just be sure to watch closely as the layers of this secret begin to unfold.<br /><br />I probably would have given this one 4.5 stars, if I could.  I deducted a star because, despite the compelling nature of this film, it isn't one I'll ever watch again.
141694737X|4.0|We love this book in our house and our toddler has requested it continually for the past year. We love all of the flaps that open with the animal inside. One of the pages states \\"Then they sent me a camel, but he was too grumpy, so I sent him back.\\" Now our toddler will say he's grumpy like a camel if he's in a bad mood. Funny! I recommend this book.
B002QEXBGS|5.0|I'm a relative newcomer to opera, just \\"discovering\\" it a year ago.  This is my second opera dvd (with the Diana Damrau \\"Die Zauberflote\\" being the first) and as much as I liked that, this has eclipsed it.  Virtually the perfect opera and staging for the interested opera neophyte, as it has a shorter running time than most operas (2 hours), and the music is consistently wonderful as are the performances.  Hilarious throughout, and I highly recommend anyone who considers opera to be stuffy and esoteric to watch the Duo de la Mouche, easily findable on a certain popular video site.  The all-French cast handles the language with ease and fluidity, as can be expected.  What really puts it over the top is the winning and hilarious performance of Natalie Dessay, a coloratura soprano known as much for her acting skills as her wonderful voice.  I truly can't recommend this enough.    Any negatives?  The occasional typo in the subtitles.  Traditionalists may be put off by the male dancers wearing women's garb, though they are just picking nits.      Gets my highest recommendation.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|Before I review the Shiled itself, I want to let everyone interested in the show know that the packaging issues involving scratched discs has been addressed.  The book like format is the same, but the packaging now contains slip covers for each disc of the show.  This prevents the discs from getting scratched, and provides further and better cover to each disc.  Be warned though, if not careful in pulling out the discs with the slip, scratching may still occur.  Otherwise, the pacackaging is pretty cool, with pictures, and references to the entirety of the show.  For those a fan of the show, its a pretty nice rememberance, for those new, it provides several clues with relatively minor spoilers.<br /><br />As to the show, to call it one of the finest cop dramas is a bit limiting.  It is just one of the finest shows.  The acting is top notch, with you often losing the feeling your watching actors, and truly feeling like your watching a documentary.  The writing is just as good.  In fact, the use of the book style in packaging is the perfect example of the show: its like a novel.  Each season bleeds into the next, with story elements of the first season being relevant all the way until the final season, with many story lines in between crossing between seasons.  The show packs an intensity as well as emotional punch that is simply superb, with the right amount of humor and angst anyone could require of any show.<br /><br />The show is violent and foul, so those looking for a sitcom probably won't find a lot to like.  But the use of violence and foul language helps the realism of the show, and necessary as judging Vic Mackey as a good guy or bad guy wouldn't be so morally grey without both.  This of course goes to the heart of the show: is Vic Mackey a good person doing bad things, a bad person doing good things in a bad way, or somewhere in between.  The show leaves it up to you to decide.  There aren't too many shows of this caliber to come along, so cherish it when you have it.  Highly recomended!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I want this to be short and sweet since so many reviews are so long and basically summaries of the plot. If you are looking for a plot summary, read other reviews, I will stick to what I want to know from a review-<br />Positives- This book catches you in to the entire series by the end. You are emotionally connected with the characters; it contains a great mystery that is enjoyable to unfold and keeps you reading to find out what is going to happen; I absolutely love the two main characters and cannot wait to read the trilogy to have them in my life for a little while longer. It also makes me want to visit Sweden!<br />Negatives- This book is VERY slow to start off- I know many people who just cannot plod through a long beginning setting the stage and this book does so. I found myself wondering what this had to do with the mystery described on the back cover several times; The mystery is predictable to those of us who read a lot of this genre.<br />In all, I am LOVING Lisbeth Salander and the sequel is even better. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to put up with a slow start for a truly enjoyable read and characters that you will think about when you are not reading!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Amazing album!<br />Songs are more creative.<br />Gus G is a great musician and you can notice from the first known music \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\".<br />I was very tired of Zakk's pentatonics (scale) and you can hear something more creative in the solo of this song something like:<br />Dorian mode (bars 1-4), Pentatonic (bars 5,6) and Melodic minor/Aeolean (bars 7,8).<br />Gus G is influenced by Hendrix, Page, Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Al Di Meola, Paul Gilbert, Vai, Malmsteen and Marty Friedman among others ([...]).<br />Some of his influences were Randy's too.<br />I think guitarrists will be more interested in learning Ozzy's songs from now on 'cause the quality got very much higher.<br />(Fan since 1980)
B001P5HI4A|5.0|The extended version is a treat with the deleted scenes added into the theatrical version. Love them! You can tell she loved making and being in this movie because of her personal commentary before the movie, and because OF HER AMAZING PERFORMANCE! The scene where she's singing alone to her father in the night after Yentl left home is so heart wrenching and REAL that you can FEEL Barbara's and Yentl's emotion through the camera. Another great musical scene was of course \\"I like the way I feel\\" piece. ANYONE who has discovered magnetic love for the first time can relate! And Yentl's awkward scenes with Hadass were very well acted and intense! Bravo Barbara! You made me love you.
0812548094|3.0|First I have to admit that the book was captivating and I 'sacrificed' significant portions of my time to read it out of curiosity about what will happen next. The book was overall fun to read and that is why I gave it 3 stars and not 2.    Now the bad parts.   As mentioned by others the book could have been at least half in size without omitting anything important.  Although the story (like all fantasy stories) is located in an environment resembling our 'middle ages' (dark ages) the characters posses a 'modern western psychology' and the whole story is entangled (I would even say almost obsessed) with very modern issues like  sex crimes, child abuse, democracy, feminism, equality, secular vs religious and so on. I personally detest this incapacity or unwillingness of the author to detach himself from our everyday world when writing a fantasy book. I also detest his personal obsession with 'evil sex' which he insists to display all over his books. Most of the negative characters have to display some sexual deviation. The evil ones always rape women and children. The 'sisters of darkness' had to have some weird ritual involving sex with a statue that comes alive (for sex only). You got the idea.  The same thing about misogyny. Every bad male character displays an unexplainable extreme misogyny. It seams that all the bad guys have to be also 'politically incorrect' in  some way. This goes even for minor characters which I can't even remember their names. For example from the two unimportant mud men that were to protect Kahalan the one who betrayed her happened to be the same one that made the remark about her sexy breasts. Of coarse the opposite also has to be true. All the good character have to display some 'modern open mind issue' like pacifism or feminism. Also the motivation of the characters is often unconvincing. Too many times they happen to be 'good' or 'bad' for no convincing reason.  His writing style also seems to be inconsistent with regard to details and passage of time. At times the story goes slowly and abounds in details like there is all the time in the world so if you skip a couple of pages you are still in the same scene/event and than just a few pages later the events develop so fast 'right to the point' that if you skip a paragraph you have missed the whole scene. Even worse, this is in inverse relation to the importance (the important parts are too condensed while the less important are too detailed ).  I say this again, despite the critics I still enjoyed reading the book.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I am enjoying this CD. I liked some songs the first time I listened and others have grown on me since then. It's laid back and easy to sing along to.
B001EN71CW|5.0|At first I thought who really cares about a Western Sci-fi series? Boy I was wrong this happened to be one of the most unique series of all time. Definitively worth watching it!
0061914177|1.0|Here's the straight to the point short answer for this book: Use facebook, and other social media sites to promote yourself! There, I just gave you all this book is going to give you. I simply gave it to you in one sentence for FREE instead of the $10 I paid for it on Amazon, and 2-hours of your time wasted reading it. It's really nothing more than a salesman's pitch book. And the pitch here is to buy his book, and read about him telling you THAT he used social media to grow his business, NOT HOW HE USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO GROW HIS BUSINESS.<br /><br />*** PLEASE NOTE ***<br />THIS IS NOT A HOW TO BOOK BY ANY MEANS. If that is what you are looking for, then look elsewhere. This book is simply about Gary saying, I used social media to grow my business. And really folks, that's it!
B000PDYVVG|1.0|This book is so awful.  This woman needs some serious psychological help.  I got so tired of reading a memoir of a person that was so incredibly self-absorbed.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is utterly hilarious the characters are so real and funny. This movie is a great family movie night type movie. Yes I am aware there is swearing but not excessively.<br />This movie is a classic!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|When I first heard that Eminem was going to release an album that dealt with more of his \\"inner self,\\" which expressed all of the negative events that had occurred in his life the last couple of years, I was excited.  I had been wanting Eminem to come with material that had lasting effect.  Relapse was good, but it wasn't an album one can put on repeat for 3 hours while they hang out at home or whatnot.  Recovery, his dialogue, his flow, his energy, his focus, keeps the listener fiending for more by the end of the 17 track album.  It is an Eminem classic.  If I were to put in to perspective with Eminem fans, I would say that Eminem's top 3 albums, in order, go 1. The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The Slim Shady LP 3. Recovery.  This is \\"grown-man\\" hip-hop in the sense that what Eminem expressed, a lot of people can relate to.  This is an outstanding album.<br /><br />Track by track:<br /><br />1.  Cold Wind Blows - 3/5 - This track starts the album off pretty well.  The intro comes in and immediately one can tell this man is focused.  He's out to prove that he's not just a popcorn/Lindsey Lohan bashing MC.  He has some things to get off his chest.  The song is a little dark, the beat sounds like Dre inspired.  By the third verse, Eminem's dark side comes out even more and it becomes a song reminiscent to Relapse.<br /><br />2.  Talkin' to Myself - 4/5 - Produced by DJ Kahlil, this track is outstanding for the most part.  The only aspect I did not care for was the chorus.  For some reason, Kobe, who sings the hook, just sounds bad to me.  There are others songs he's been on the last couple of years and to me he sounds too \\"whiny.\\"  But regardless, this track is produced well.  Eminem goes off (on himself).  He gives himself a sort of pep talk he could have used within these last couple of years.  He talks about going after Kanye and Wayne (at their prime last year), but thought that if he did he would have been \\"murdered\\" by them.  It's a great record.<br /><br />3.  On Fire - 4/5 - This track is by far the most traditional when it comes to hip-hop.  He goes off on the critics of the industry.  Lyrically and flow wise, this song is the best on the album.  He spits with such precise wordplay, it should continue amaze the listener with each listen<br /><br />4.  Won't Back Down - 3/5 - This song features the pop star Pink.  It's heavy influenced by a rock beat and Eminem's \\"shouting.\\"  He does do a good job on the song and the beat is energetic, yet, I feel like it could have been more.  Maybe the chorus hinders it a bit.  But Eminem is on his game when it comes to him riding the beat, which is tough on a rock track as this song attempts to be.<br /><br />5.  W.T.P. - 4/5 - This song will remind listeners of a track from The Slime Shady LP (\\"Drugs\\"?)  It's a \\"feel good\\" track that can easily be played at a house party.  The chorus is catchy, yet funny.  It's a great tack.<br /><br />6.  Going Through Changes - 5/5 - The sample of Ozzy Ozzborne might throw some people off on paper, but the record comes across perfectly as Eminem spits over a mellow beat.  This is the first track on the album that Eminem goes deep into his conscience and expresses it to the listener in such a flawless way we feel we are the room with him and a psychiatrist.  It's an incredible song.<br /><br />7.  Not Afraid - 5/5 - This was the first single from the album and to me, got me very excited for the entire album.  This song is as good as it gets with Eminem.  His lyrics, melody, chorus, etc. shows such details in its planning - it's easy to tell that Eminem took his time perfecting the song.  It will be one of the songs that will be on his greatest hits for years to come.<br /><br />8.  Seduction - 5/5 - This is that one song on every hip-hop album that is directed to the women.  However, the way that Eminem executes the song it will make any male listener appreciate his lyrics and effort.  But it turns out to be a \\"verbal seduction\\" to anyone who listens.  His bravado swagger spills on every verse to the point where you just have to respect he man.  It's a hip-hop song 100%.<br /><br />9.  No Love - 5/5 - I always wondered why Lil' Wayne was featured on so many other artists albums.  And I came to the conclusion that it is because he has the younger generation of hip-hop fans in a chokehold.  But in Eminem's case?  I think he wanted the opportunity to school the young'ns in the fact that Eminem can lift Wayne upside down and mop the floor with his dreads.  And that is exactly what he does on this track.  Eminem goes off with more energy than I have ever heard him go into a song.  Wayne's verse comes first (and is impressive), but Eminem comes in and overtakes the song with the clarity that was showed when Eminem graced Jay-Z's \\"Renegades.\\"<br /><br />10. Space Bound - 5/5 - This is one of the more melancholy tracks on the album.  It is a track which Eminem expresses a lot of his personal dealings.  The chorus is a bit much with its high pitch, but all in all, the song produces the exact feeling it was going for.  Lyrically, one of the my favorite tracks on the album.<br /><br />11. Cinderella Man - 4/5 - This track will immediatly remind listeners of the song \\"Til I Callapse.\\"  The beat along with Eminem's energy produces one of the best tracks on the album.  Heads will be nodding to this one.<br /><br />12.  25 to Life - 5/5 - Another melancholy track that is infused with emotion.  On first listen, the DJ Kahlil produced song can be misconstrued as a song directed toward an ex girl or even Kim.  But it's not.  It's about the art of hip-hop.  It's a very clever way of getting everything off his chest.  One of the greatest songs on the album.<br /><br />13.  So Bad - 5/5 - This is the head nodding track that we have grown to love.  It's produced by Dr. Dre and gives the listener a reason to be excited about these two teaming up again.  It's the only Dre produced song on the entire album.  I think that is a good thing, only because it makes us appreciate Dre's beats even more.  This is a great hip-hop song.<br /><br />14. Almost Famous - 3/5 - The track about fame, which has become one of the requirements it seems in hip-hop today.  It's a great song, but lacks direction.  Some of the lines are classic Eminem though.  It almost seems that this song could have been included on Relapse.  If you loved Relapse, then you will love this track.<br /><br />15. Love the Way You Lie - 4/5 - When hearing that Rihanna was on a track, I was a little nervous.  I thought it was going to be a pop inspired track (like Pink track had done for me), but it is surprisingly a very deep song about relationships and the role men and women both play in them.  For a track with Rihanna on it, it's interesting that Em would discuss domestic violence.  All in all, an excellent track<br /><br />16. Your Never Over - 3/5 - Now, this track is Eminem's ode to his bestfriend, the late MC Proof.  Listening to Eminem speak about his affection for his fallen friend is a good listen because you can feel that Eminem is really hurting and a lot of us can relate to the dude.  But the chorus...oh the chorus.  I can't tell if Eminem is messing around or if he really meant to sound the way he does, but it almost like nails on a chalkboard.  Eminem has a great voice for choruses, but this one I think hurts the song as a whole.<br /><br />17.  Untitled - 4/5 - This is the outro to the album.  It is placed at the end so that the listener can hear Eminem go off.  It seems almost like a freestyle.  The wordplay and flow are reminicent to his older records.  A great tack to finish the album with.<br /><br />This album has direction and a purpose.  Eminem had a lot of things to speak on.  Eminem fans will love it, but if you are looking for Relapse 2, then you will be dissopointed.  But like I said before, this is grown man hip-hop (as far as the subject matter).  It's easy to relate to.  And the beats and the features might not betypical Eminem...but it should be.<br /><br />13.mous - 3/5 - The track about fame, which has become one of the requirements it seems in hip-hop today.

B00008OE4W|5.0|This movie is both fast paced and exciting and hilarious. At some moments you will be actually be on the edge of your seat (i.e the scene where Redford is in the office) and then there are other scenes you will be cracking up at (i.e when whistler is reading playboy for the blind).<br />This movie does have swearing but its definitely a movie a family can enjoy.<br />I would say 10+ even though its pg13.<br />Great plot, great screenplay, great actors, great movie!
B002WY65W4|3.0|I gave this movie a 3 star rating however it should be 3.75 stars.  It had some great scenes and some other parts that were so so.    I loved Bill Murray in this movie.  It has a great cast and a good story.  The film was it was hit and miss overall.  However, I would say go see this movie.  It provides plenty of laughs.  If you like zombies and comedy don't miss this one.
B0000633T6|5.0|This movie starts with an intense scene which leaves you wondering what's happening and as the movie continues you slowly grasp what is/has happened. This movie combines two of my favorite actors Brad Pitt and Robert Redford. Them together creates a fast paced psychological battle against time. They make this movie so good that I found myself at the edge of my seat wondering what's gonna happen next.<br />This is definitely a must see!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Heath Ledger's performance will make it very difficult for anyone else to ever play the Joker.  Edgy, Dark and delightful.  This is a movie everyone should see.  Action packed and great performances.  I saw this in the theaters and then on DVD.  It is bested seen on the big screen because it is one of those  big movies that make movie screens come alive.  It is also an intense movie on the TV screen screen as well.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|If you enjoyed Riordan's series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, then you'll love his next series. In the Red Pyramid, you'll find the characters are easy to fall in love with. First we have Carter; a little timid, just a tad stupid, fun and lovable. His sister Sadie (who grew up with their grandparents in London while Carter lived with their dad, traveling his whole life), is a bit of a rebel and often acts superior to her brother though she is the younger of the two siblings.<br /><br />Along the way, we meet other characters: Doughboy, a small man made of clay with an adittude; Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom who just discovered Memphis TN was NOT Memphis Egypt; Horus, the god of the sky who has a very big ego (I quote him when I say, &#34;No one bests Horus!&#34;); and Khufu, a baboon who loves basketball and only eats things that end in &#34;O&#34; such as a flamingo.<br /><br />I don't plan on giving away any of the plot to you, but I really suggest you read it. It's funny, there's action and even a bit of suspense. The POV (point of view) switches between Carter and Sadie throughout the book as they tell their story, which gives you a better understanding of the siblings' personalities.<br /><br />Riordan's style of writing is refreshing and different in this series as well as PJATO, but I think I might go so far as to say this series might just be a little better.
B002CGPI3O|5.0|Something about this album really puts me in a pensive mood, yearning for the unknown, aching while immersed in the quiet tempos but uplifted when the music rises. I can't stop listening because I don't want to stop feeling moved.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Del principio hasta el final los 88 capítulos de \\"The Shield\\" mantienen la tensión y el suspenso. El protagonista, un antihéroe, se enfrenta todo el tiempo con un dilema: lo quiere versus lo que debe. Generalmente opta por lo primero -su propio beneficio- pero descubre que no siempre es capaz de manejar las consecuencias. Es un manipulador nato que sólo ocasionalmente es traicionado por sus emociones.     Las actuaciones son impecables, con un soberbio Michael Chikris. El guión se basa en el conflicto y su resolución, no siempre favorable, lo que mantiene la intriga hasta el final. Además aborda temas como el liderazgo y el trabajo en equipo. En este aspecto, señala con claridad meridiana como los roles disfuncionales sabotean involuntariamente la gestión de personas que trabajan con el mismo propósito.     La presentación del box set es espectacular, pero tuve un problema: en el primer envío faltaron dos discos (Amazon repuso el producto sin ningún inconveniente). Finalmente un detalle: la última temporada, la 7ª, no viene subtitulada. Resumiendo, no pude parar de verla. Es adictiva y brillante del principio hasta el final.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|With a warm, beautiful smile, and a benevolent spirit, Director Kenny Ortega shares with us the dynamic footage of rehearsals for Michael Jackson's last concert, which was intended for Jackson's eyes only, but has now, like the life of Jackson himself, become a gift to the world, and especially to his children, with whom he had hoped to share his final performances.    Amid the footage of auditioning dancers expressing delight at being able to work with Michael, and technichians demonstrating their craft, we see the King of Pop in full creative process, revamping his old numbers with gentle perfectionism and humour,leading his chosen troupe members in spirited dance moves.    As a Generation Xer around for his entire career, my thoughts have flown back over the innumerable images of Michael Jackson that I've seen onscreen and in print on and off over the years since his passing. When he was at the height of his fame in the 80s, I was going through a passionately retro phase in my tastes in music, declining to behave like a card-carrying member of the MTV Generation, but I knew what Michael was up to, as did anyone who paid attention to entertainment news.   We are led through performances of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", \\"Jam\\", and \\"Bad\\", during which we view notable details of the stage interpretations, as a counterpoint to the iconic videos of the '80s and '90s. Original music for the concert was produced by Michael Bearden.   Other numbers include \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", which within days, would become a rallying song for election fraud protesters in Iran, but which here is performed with a digitalized army, followed by a performance of \\"Human Nature\\".   A film noir feature of \\"Smooth Criminal\\",in which Michael is shown responding to clips featuring Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart, as well as a scene of the original 1988 short film version follows.M.J. makes a spectacular exit in that number.    He struts with Mekia Cox during, \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\",and revisits the dance moves in an urban setting that were a part of the video of this 1987 release.   There are a few slip-ups, but as he noted, \\"That's why we rehearse.\\"   Then we are entertained by the numbers from the days of the Jackson 5, some of which Michael and his back-up performers sing in a different key from the originals. That medley includes, \\"I Want You Back\\", \\"The Love You Save\\", \\"I'll Be There\\", and a very energetically performed, \\"Shake Your Body Down to the Ground\\".   Judith Hill joins him for \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\".   The recreation of \\"Thriller\\" was thrilling indeed, and it really would have been  something to see Michael emerge from that giant tarantula during that number. The dancing ghouls really hit the mark. The applause of the audience at the end of that number would have been deafening had the concert series come to fruition!    In creating the costumes, and designing the sets, viewers receive an education about how associations with aerialsts (including acrobat Dreya Weber), jewelers, and a few scientists to create special effects in both the costumes and the sets.   \\"Beat It!\\" also evokes memories of the original video from the 80s, but with choreography last seen in Jackson's 2001 CBS Special.    The Greek-Australian guitarist, Orianthi has her moment to shine during the rehearsal for the song, \\"Black or White\\",and she does so alongside fellow guitarist, Tommy Organ.    Little Jasmine Alveran has a dramatic role to play during the rehearsal for \\"Earth Song\\", followed by the commentary about the state of the planet by the founder of the Heal the World Foundation--rather solemn musings by the man who held the Guinness World Record as the Most Humanitarian Entertainer for the last nine years of his life.   \\"Billie Jean\\" still has the same verve as it did in the 80s, although frankly, I was never much for the crotch grab that he claimed was a subliminal gesture.   Although slight and frail looking, Jackson certainly didn't move like a man of 50.    \\"Man in the Mirror\\" is the last number performed onstage. The rehearsal ends on a favorable note.   Within hours of that final rehearsal, eternal life greeted Michael as he was making other plans, much to the dismay of the world for which he did so much.But the final triumph is still his because of the unity, reverence, and love expressed in the wake of his loss. Within a little more than a week, Mekia Cox,Tyne Stecklein, Timor Steffens, et al  would show the world how to go on like troupers in Michael's absence as they danced on the dais above his casket, while Jennifer Hudson took masterful command of his gospel song, \\"Will You Be There?\\"   More people will see this footage of the final exquisite gift Michael intended to present to the world than would have ever been able to see him perform live.   He was sharp, and at the top of his game until the very end--a supernova still at his brightest. And our film ends with a final laugh and a dance from the beloved entertainer.   The final lines of \\"September Song\\" are what come to mind in the final analysis of this film: \\"...And these few precious days I'll spend with you...These precious days, I'll spend with you.\\"   All my gratitude goes to those who shared this precious footage with us!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I read some review indicating the technology behind the product may be over-the-hill. I thought GlobalSat ND-100 might be a better choice, but finally decided to use a proven product. I never own other GPS device before, but the experience of using GlobalSat BU-353 in the US is excellent - very sensitive and accurate. Just be patient to wait for less than a minute to get the signal after connection.  I'll use it in Europe in the coming days, that'll be the real test.    Buyer beware: My friend bought the ND-100, turn out he got a global version that sends out signal at baud rate 38400. Need to jump over the hoop to convert that back to 4800 to fit the software that uses the US standard.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This just entered into the realm of the Marshall Mathers LP and the Eminem Show (sorry Slim Shady LP still love you), maybe even beyond.  He's back to where he should be, only sober with more intelligence and more maturity.  Who would have thought this CD lived up to the hype?  Nobody.  Who would have thought he could put out a CD where he didn't take 10 songs to slam celebrities, his mother, and kim?  No one.  It's all about him, his freedom from drugs and alcohol and how this all has affected who he is and what he loves...rap.  Album of the year to date
0805091742|5.0|Initially, when a friend recommended it to me, I thought \\"wow, how can you write a whole book about something as simple as a checklist?\\" but it turns out that most people find it beneath them to use a checklist and Atul Gawande is here to change their minds about it. I am convinced about the positive effects of checklists after I read this book. I liked that the book gave many examples of checklists helping different fields (aviation, construction, medicine, cooking). The stories were all very interesting and I think checklists will help you become a more organized person who remembers the important steps.
0545123267|5.0|I loved this story.  It flowed well even though you switch between Grace's and Sam's POV.  I liked that because you can really understand what both people are feeling and you get to hear the thoughts behind the spoken words.  I really enjoyed the story, I read through it so fast because I just had to find out what was going to happen next.  So, when I was finished I decided to read it again just to get any bits that I had missed the first time....and it was even better the second time through.  Loved the ending...so glad it wasn't a total cliffhanger....that would have been torture!  Can't wait to read Linger next month!!!
B003JR1JV0|5.0|Miley once again proved why Shes an amazing singer. Every song was written by her and you can tell it means something to her. this is a great album for a true music fan. Best Disney star. Without question.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This and \\"Robinson Caruso on Mars\\" are my cult favorites.  I was a kid when they came out.  Without this move we might not have had \\"Star Trek\\".  This movie inspired \\"Star Trek\\".  They even had a hat from the movie in the original pilot with Jeffrey Hunter as captain Pike.  If you watch carefully in a sceen in Captain Pikes cabin there is a hat sitting on top of a TV!!!! LOL  That hat was in the movie \\"Forbidden Planet\\".  Gene admitted to being inspired by this movie.
B0012GMX3I|5.0|Wet is a somewhat underrated Barbra Streisand album with the theme of water in all of the songs. It's actually a fine concept album that stands the test of time; people still buy this on CD today and that's grand. Barbra is in excellent form here; her voice is as clear as a bell and she can hit any note she desires. The duet she performs with Donna Summer, \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),\\" made the airwaves sizzle back when it was originally released and it was played in clubs everywhere! In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork incorporates the artwork from the original record album release.<br /><br />The album starts with the title song, \\"Wet.\\" Barbra sings this passionately and it comes off sounding great. She handles complex tempo and key changes like the pro she always is! \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" has a 70's flavor to the arrangement and it all holds its own very well. Barbra never skips a beat and I love it! \\"Splish Splash\\" uses the guitars to great advantage and I would like to think that Bobby Darin would have liked this version of this number. True, \\"Splish Splash\\" may not be the strongest number on the album but it is done very, very well.<br /><br />\\"On Rainy Afternoons\\" is another tune that gets a most sensitive treatment from Barbra Streisand and she delivers it faultlessly. The arrangement for the piano enhances the natural beauty of this ballad, too. \\"After the Rain\\" has a similar feel to \\"On Rainy Afternoons;\\" and so I can see why some people would say that perhaps the very aggressive number \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" with Donna Summer doesn't quite fit in. I, however, think it works well not just independently but also within the other songs on this CD; there's nothing wrong with occasionally changing gears and Barbra does this in style. Donna Summer is very good as well.<br /><br />\\"Niagara\\" is a beautiful ballad that Barbra performs without a flaw; and the music fits in perfectly with her vocals. Wisely, however, the musicians never even try to steal the show from Streisand; she remains squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\" is energetic and dynamic; I really like this number. The CD ends very well with Barbra Streisand performing \\"Kiss Me in the Rain;\\" this leaves me wanting to push the reply button on my CD player to hear the entire album all over again--and I often do just that!<br /><br />Wet is an amazing Barbra Streisand album and it's clearly a must-have for her fans. It also has a terrific `70s flavor to it that I enjoy so much; and people who like concept albums from the world's greatest entertainers like Streisand would do well to get this for their collections.r even try to steal the show from Streisand; she remains squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\" is energetic and dynamic; I really like this number.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|MAN! THE ROOTS CONTINUE TO AMAZE ME. HIGO IS THE BEST ALBUM I'VE HEARD ALL YEAR. THIS AND NAS' AND DAMIAN MARLEY'S DISTANT RELATIVES ARE BOTH IN SUPER HEAVY ROTATION IN MY CAR AND CRIB. HIGO IS PLAYABLE FROM BEGINNING TO END EVEN THOUGH THE HOOKS ON 'RADIO DAZE' AND 'NOW OR NEVER' ARE PRETTY ANNOYING. I STILL LOVE BOTH TRACKS THOUGH BECAUSE THE BEATS AND LYRICS MAKE UP FOR THAT. MY FAVORITE TRACK ON THE ALBUM IS 'THE DAY'. WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS LIKE \\"OH S#@T\\"!!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THAT ONE PERFORMED LIVE. PLUS I'M ALL ABOUT ORIGINALITY SO I LOVE THE FACT THAT ONLY THREE OUT OF THE 14 TRACKS ARE BLATANT SAMPLES OR COVERS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SAMPLING BUT I LOVE TO SEE HOW ORIGINAL AND CREATIVE PEOPLE CAN BE. DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING. THIS WON'T DISSAPOINT.
B001HN694K|1.0|I found this to be awfully boring even with Johnnie Depp.  I liked the Walt Disney cartoon version to be much more enjoyable. The version I watched had no sub-titles. The movie as a whole was was dark and hard to make out most of the time. I don't see how a young child would watch this w/out falling asleep.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I started watching FlashForward late in the series and really liked it. Dominic Monaghan plus a few other familiar faces was what drew me to it. I bought the dvd with the first 10 episodes on it. Inside is an insert for $15 dollars off...all you have to do is to go to a website and download the coupon.  This is for fans who, like me already bought the first part but would still like to purchase the whole season when available. So for people who are getting the wrong idea and think after buying the first part, now they're trying to get us to buy the whole thing at an extra cost, don't be misinformed by negative reviews.<br />If you bought the first dvd, open it up and read the insert. And for people who never even bought the first dvd, if you don't know the facts, you shouldn't confuse other fans.[[ASIN:B0031ZWZR2 FlashForward: Season One Pt.1]]
B001HN694K|3.0|I almost enjoyed it.  It was slow, dark, confusing and could not qualify as a  sequel.  Any connection between a returning 19 year old Alice, the sweet farm girl in the original and the conniving unlikeable characters could only be impossible. Alice should have at least met the MAD HATTER in her real life on her way to China.  Save your money, rent it and get it out of your system so you can say you saw it.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|This is a great album and it total rocks, people complained about his last few albums but if they give a listen to Scream everyone will know the ozzman is back and ready to rock. Diggin' me Down is a standout track, the only one I could do without is I love you all. Go pick it up now it is well worth it.
0812932293|4.0|I am about halway through the book, but so far I have really enjoyed it.  The book is definitely different than what I expected.  It basically an autobiography by Richard Branson, but it offers very clear business lessons along the way. He has lived an VERY interesting life so it actually helps the book flow very well. Very enjoyable read so far.
B001HN694K|3.0|I think the film had more elements from \\"Through The Looking Glass\\" than from \\"Alice In Wonderland\\". Maybe the producers thought today's audience wouldn't recognize the title \\"Through The Looking Glass\\" as readily as it would the title \\"Alice In Wonderland\\". Or maybe today's audience wouldn't know what a \\"looking glass\\" is.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|This is the album I have been waiting for, by Eminem. The last album I really enjoyed to the fullest by him is The Eminem Show. I am going to be honest I haven't even listened to Relapse yet I know it's sad, but I know he was going through stuff. Now on Recovery I see him coming back to the light. I have been listening to him since I remember. I'm just hoping he can rise above again. It's sad to see what has happened to him the last few years. Recovery has made me break down, and cry. On Recovery he let's how he truly feels out. Sometimes in life to get ahead it takes to write what you been through, it's a great release. I am impressed by Recovery, I just hope things get better from here.
B000FA5MUI|3.0|The novel is great, but the terrible formatting of the RosettaBooks edition makes it almost unreadable. Quotation marks are misplaced with the wrong sentences, spacing is incorrect, and so on. I e-mailed them about the problems but got no reply.
0545123275|3.0|Not that I think there's anything really wrong with Twilight (see my review of) but there only needed to be one such series; I would have liked it if this book branced away from the love at first sight, star-crossed lovers theme.<br /> If I hadn't read about a million vampire and werewolf books over the last few years (this is a book just about werewolves, and yeah, it's my own fault that I'm addicted to a genre that tends to be predictable) I would have been a lot more into this book. It's very well written, the romance is very sweet, if not totally believable (am I the only one who thinks that you should know more about someone, than that you like gazing into their eyes + they're a supernatural creature, to fall in love?)<br /> Though the book is around three or four hundred pages, I thought some things needed more explaining. A lot of the characters exhibit some pretty bizarre behavior (the heroine's father nearly kills her when she's a toddler because he forgets she's riding in the car on a hundred degree day, and leaves her in said car!!) that aren't explained. Of course, I'm going to read the sequel, which may explain more. I thought that the werewolves had diverse personalities but again wanted to know more.<br /> SPOILER<br /> There are sex scenes between teenagers and I didn't remember any references to birth control (a fellow amazon customer let me know that yes, there is a brief referance to birth control being used) and at the end of the book the characters inject themselves with a deadly virus to combat the werewolf poison.<br /> END OF SPOILER<br /> Though it could have been better, this is a well-written book (the writing grabs your attention and makes you want to keep reading). If you like werewolves and aren't totally sick of supernatural romance, I'd say, try it.
B002ZFQD0E|1.0|If i could give it Zero rating I would, just do not get this person.  Strange, but the music is terrible to me.   Maybe I need to listen to the mess again. No, I listen to it 3 times and Can not stand her CD.  Advise to her is to find out what kind of music you want to  and stick to it, but you are not R&B.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Pixar, but who isn't? Not many people can claim that there isn't at least one Pixar film in their delightful repertoire that they don't feel strongly about or hasn't moved them in the slightest. But as much as I adore Pixar and as admirable and enjoyable as Toy Story is for introducing the world to a wonderful animation studio, I didn't love the first two films quite as much as most do. I was under the impression I'd feel the same way about Toy Story 3, but luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />Something has to be said about the \\"Day & Night\\" short that played before Toy Story 3. It was spectacular. Pixar has always been fantastically imaginative anyway, but \\"Day & Night\\" is one of the most original animated shorts I've ever had the pleasure of sitting though. A truly brilliant piece of animation.<br /><br />My mom used to make a career out of making and selling teddy bears, so toys, action figures, and stuffed animals have pretty much always been a part of my life in some capacity. It seemed like we'd always find her bears in spots where we didn't leave them and in positions we didn't remember leaving them in, so we came up with this story that they were alive and would throw parties when we weren't in the room. Everybody played with toys growing up and that's one of the reasons why the Toy Story films are so easy to relate to. Toy Story 3 makes you realize how much you love these characters you've been spending the better part of 15 years getting to know. You don't want to see their adventures end. The fact that Pixar is capable of making its audience care so much about CG animated characters that are made of plastic or whose insides are nothing more than stuffing is extraordinary in itself.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 not only lives up to the first two films, but surpasses them entirely. The third film throws you into this ingenious world where you're just immersed in originality and creativity. Not that the first two films didn't already establish that, but you lose yourself and get sucked in much quicker this time around.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 may not just be a movie of the year candidate, but it might be the most satisfying third film in a franchise ever. It manages to introduce new characters that you grow to care about by the end of the film while effectively ending the story between Andy and his toys. The sequel lives up to Pixar's reputation for being incredibly moving and heartfelt. Toy Story 3 has everything and appeals to all ages. I'm going to go on record as saying that Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story film to date and easily the best film of the first six months of 2010.nd get sucked in much quicker this time around.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is the most plausible depiction of the future I have seen on a science fiction television show.  It is incredibly well rounded, with rich and unique characters.  The thing I like most about it is its ability to cater to all manner of tastes.  For the lowbrow, there are plenty of blatant, up front jokes and then you have the more subtle background gags, some of which you may not notice until your third viewing.  Point is, the show never gets old, I'm on my 6th runthrough.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Just to give a little background about my personal tastes, I think of myself as somewhat of a hip-hop connoiseur. I don't really mess with most of the BS on the radio/ hot charts these days. At the same time, I wouldn't even think of saying hip-hop is dead. There are so many dope artists out there, but people simply don't know/ don't care about looking for them. For me, Eminem is one of the few talented well-selling hip-hop artists out there these days. On this disc, Eminem raises the bar to an elite level of lyricism that few artists have reached. He brings an incredible amount of focus to the table here, and his true skills are really showing through on the entire album. Now that you get a sense for me as a stuck-up type of critic who wouldn't raise an eyebrow at just any trash that comes out, let's go through the tracks 1 by 1:    1. Cold Wind Blows - I think this track is an incredible opener. From the first line, I just get the sense that he's not messing around anymore. Gone are the goofy accents and lame celebrity/ mom jokes/ whatever. The punch lines that he hits (usually) seem to have a purpose, and it's evident that he is trying to relate to others with his music. 8.5/10    2. Talkin' 2 Myself - This song is very reflective and self-aware. It's apparent that he isn't happy with some of the material that he's put out in the past, and there is some interesting commentary about Relapse and his potential to start beef with other artists. It's good, but not great... 7/10    3. On Fire - I'm surprised to see a lot of other reviewers not liking this song. This song is HOT! The verses are great. The chorus is intentionally somewhat bland, but it plays a part in the song at the same time. He does what he sets out to do in this track and spits some fire in each verse. 9/10    4. Won't Back Down - Like many others, I question having Pink on the track in the way she's used. In the end though, it doesn't matter. Em tears this track up. It's very catchy, and lyrically one of my favorites on the disc. 9/10    5. W.T.P. - This is a funny party track. It's no \\"My Fault,\\" but it's definitely worth some listens. I wouldn't write this one off as filler. 7/10    6. Going Through Changes - Point blank: by far my least favorite track on the cd. The Ozzy sample doesn't make any sense, and Em's lyrics are too deep for their own good on this track. Everything here seems really bland and unnecessary. The beat is pretty wack... I can't think of anything I like about this song. 2 for effort. 2/10    7. Not Afraid - Like many others, this was the first track that I heard from this cd. I wasn't expecting much after Relapse, but this track definitely caught my attention. To be honest, it's nothing that special, but the fact that the lyrics were so much tighter and focused than his previous work is the only reason why I looked into this cd in the first place. 7/10    8. Seduction - This beat is SUPER TIGHT, one of my favorite beats on the disc. As a whole, this just feels like one of the best and complete songs musically on the album. Don't sleep on this one. 9/10    9. No Love - It's no surprise that a track with Lil Wayne would really be hyped up. Both Wayne and Em kill this track on their verses. The theme \\"no love\\" is definitely present when Eminem spits venom at everyone on his verse... I wonder if Lil Wayne is feeling the lack of love here, haha. Lives up to the hype. 9/10    10. Space Bound - I have some mixed feelings about this song. The beat doesn't really seem to work, and the chorus seems just as out of place. I just don't know about this one, and I'm not sure how to explain why. I really do like the heartfelt lyrics though, and they somewhat redeem this song. 6/10    11. Cinderella Man - Em's flow is ridiculous on this one. The beat, while repetitive, is (almost) a real banger. 8/10    12. 25 To Life - I don't know how anyone could not like this song. Very heartfelt lyrics that on the surface appear to be about a relationship with a woman, but they seem to be aimed at the rap game here. I love the chorus, too, the melody gets stuck in my head. 9/10    13. So Bad - Filler. This song's a mess. Not feelin it. 3/10    14. Almost Famous - Oh my... haha... you gotta hear this one. If you're debating getting this cd, or skeptical about Eminem's improved sound since Relapse, this should make a powerful statement. Probably the most advanced lyricism that I've ever heard from Eminem. He absolutely rips this track apart over a perfectly dark beat. 10/10    15. Love The Way You Lie - A song with Rihanna...? With the topic partially about domestic abuse, really...? And to top it off, it's a good song? Somehow, Rihanna and Eminem work really well together. If you take away the vocals from Em, this song sounds like your typical Top 40's pop song, but for some reason I really dig it. Don't write this one off too quickly, it's actually a good song. 7.5/10    16. You're Never Over - First, you need to get past Eminem's singing on this one. It's not pretty, but the song turns out to be a very emotional tribute to Proof. This should have been the way the album ended, in my opinion. 7/10    17. Untitled - Meh... there are some creative lines here, but there is really nothing special. I'm not sure why this track was chosen to end the album. 6/10    Overall, this is probably the most solid release yet from Eminem. I've been a big fan from the beginning, but even MMLP and The Eminem Show didn't seem to have the same focus and cohesiveness that he puts together on Recovery. Sure, there are a few weak tracks in my opinion, but the way that Eminem has progressed as an artist is truly impressive here.
B003CIG7AE|3.0|I had never heard of Band of Horses before I listened to this album, so I had no idea what to expect.  I found the lyrics quite well written, and the music very good, but the pacing of the music for the most part seemed leaden and passionless, as if the composer was suffering from depression and/or ennui.  On an initial listen, I didn't find the songs very different from one another, they mostly had a kind of gray sameness.  If you stripped out the lyrics, this would be great music to fall asleep to.  There were a few songs, after re-listening to the album, that kinda grew on me: On My Way Back Home, Laredo, Compliments, and NW Apt.  But so much on Infinite Arms just has a blank, sad sameness to it, nothing really pops or stands out.  This album is beautifully done, but barren.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I'd heard a lot about this book being quite good from various sources and it didn't disappoint.  Without going into too much detail I enjoyed it, great character development, original plot and I liked that it was set in a country outside the UK or US for a change - something different.
0142428698|5.0|This is a very interesting and fun little book.  Theo is smitten with the law.  Both his paarents are lawyers.  He knows his way around the court house and knows many employees, including lawyers and judges.  They all know him.  Allhis school classmates come to him with problems.  Theo then gets involved with a murder investigation.  I will not divulge the rest.    Richard Thomas does a wonderful job as narrator.

B003ICWTR4|4.0|This is a wonderful live 2 DVD set recorded in Hyde Park, London during the Hard Rock Calling Festival on 28 June 2009 in HD by \\"The Boss\\" Bruce Springsteen & E-Street Band in support of the then new release \\"Working On A Dream\\" album. The 163 min recording encompasses songs from his massive  repertoire including favourites \\"No Surrender\\" & \\"Hard Times (Come Again No More)\\" among others (the usual suspects). Rarities in this 2 DVD set include \\"Trapped\\" (Jimmy Cliff),\\" Good Lovin'\\" (The Young Rascals) & \\"London Calling\\" (The Clash). As usual with \\"The Boss\\" Bruce Springsteen & E-Street Band,the performance is impressive (but not spectacular, as compared to shows like 'Live in Barcelona', released in 2003) but visuals are rather breathtaking (as recorded in HD). The set has however only two tracks from \\"Working On A Dream\\" : \\"Outlaw Pete\\" & \\"Working On A Dream\\". One would have expected more tracks from the new album as promo! Bonus material includes the song \\"The River\\" recorded a day before (27 June 2009) in Glastonbury & \\"Wrecking Ball\\" recorded in Giants Stadium in New Jersey.
B003HARV7A|4.0|Showgirls is a good movie of an over-used story line ~ young girl surviving on her own.  Learning thru living it the hard way.  I find the story line very credible, unlike some previous reviews.  If turning to the streets, living under the foot of a pimp is a possible out-come why not a little push in the back when no-one is looking.<br /> Beautiful NAKED bodies, what's not to like.  If it is something we would like ourselves to simulate, what is bad about that.  Showgirls is a look at morality, in a place & time, where it is hard to find.  You couldn't do this story (showgirls) justice any other way, than to show life as it is, down to their naked bodies.<br /> My wife also gives this movie 4 stars.  She wasn't as enthusiastic as I, of all the beautiful bodies. However she enjoyed looking into a possible life & drama of a Vegas show-girl, with no blinders on.<br /><br /> Blu-ray has a nice picture, I can see it in sinsational clarity on my 60 in tv.  Sound is very good out of my Denon receiver thru my mirage speakers.<br /> Just a worker bee's opinion.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|I have known Cyndi Lauper since 80s, liked and bought her two albums \\"She Is So Unusual\\" & \\"True Colors\\". These are pop/rock albums that made her a star in the 80s & 90s. Her live performances have always been phenomenal from this singer-songwriter from New York. On this wonderful new CD release \\"Memphis Blues\\", Cyndi Lauper collaborates with great blues artists : Charlie Musselwhite (\\"I'm Just Your Fool\\" & \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\"), Allen Toussaint (Shattered Dreams\\",\\"Mother Earth\\" & \\"Early In The Morning\\" with the legendary blues maestro B.B.King), Johnny Lang (\\"How Blue Can You Get\\" & Cross Roads\\") & Kenny Brown (\\"Rolling And Tumblin'\\" with Peebles). There is however one solo beautiful effort by Cyndi Lauper in this album release, namely  \\"Wild Women Don't Get The Blues\\" [This track is not included in digipak but in iTunes & Import CD versions only]. Cyndi Lauper is back with & in \\"Memphis Blues\\" with a bang, can't wait to see a release of her live performances in support of her new blues album of note \\"Memphis Blues\\"!
0061537969|4.0|I received this book as a belated birthday present. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but found it was very engrossing. Stein's story is actually very melodramatic. I find it interesting that a Jodi Picoult review of this book is so prominently featured on the cover.IMO,  Stein writes with some of the same overly-melodramatic style as Picoult. If this story had not been narrated by a dog, I'd probably have rated it much lower. However, Enzo's role as narrator elevates the story. Although some complained that the story is told in the 'past tense', and is thus not as engaging for those readers, I found that Enzo's 'connected detachment', and his attempts to rationalize as humans might, or just fill in the blanks through his 'embellishment' and 'dramatic license', made the story more enjoyable.  In some places,Enzo's personality reminds me of the narraror from Mark Haddon's 'Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime'; Enzo has a personality that comes as both 'adult and profound', but also sometimes amusingly childlike and innocent. I found it easy to 'connect' with Enzo, moreso than with any of the human characters.  Other portions of the story, particularlythe ending, remind me of Mitch Albom's 'Five People You Meet in Heaven'. Readers who dislike stories such touches of 'fantasy' may not care for this book. Most others, particularly dog owners, will know where stein is coming from.  If you own a dog, you should read this book!
030726999X|4.0|Bizarrely, I saw the movie of the first part, skipped the second part, and went right into this last book. That's because my library had it available and I grabbed it off the shelf. After being lost at the outset by a few murders, names, and events here and there, I slipped right into the conspiracy details, characters, and action. Well written, sophisticated, amazing lead characters, clever plotting. It all equals a fine read. Pity Larsson couldn't continue.
0330449605|3.0|I really enjoyed this long, intricately-plotted story. However, Ms. Morton loses two stars from five, one for not knowing how to use a period. The sentence fragments, though I got used to them at some point, were incredibly irritating. The other point she lost was for pacing. The story plods along, never increasing or decreasing in intensity.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I watched almost every DVD in this set immediately.  It's great.  I wish they offered more behind the scenes insights from the writers and creators, but overall I recommend this set.
B003KUSUG8|1.0|Not spending a lot of time on this.  This release is some doo do.  It appears the rap game has passed him by.  The production is not very good and his lyrics are so so..
B002VECMAE|3.0|For months, all of my friends have been telling me what a great movie this is and how I must see it.  Finally, I did.  Unfortunately, I am not as nearly as excited about the film as I wanted to be.  It has start studded cast (Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor and George Clooney).  Film feels just so looney at times that it took some effort on my behalf to be patient with it.  I was hoping that it will get better as it went along, but I was wrong.    Jeff Bridges is really funny in his role of a hippie soldier.  But in some way it felt as a recast of his role in \\"Big Lebowski\\".    On the bright side, there were some beautiful goats in this movie - if you are into goats.
078513915X|2.0|I'm a big Austen fan, and I thought the graphic novel would be a lot of fun. The artwork was a big turn off for me. Lots of closeups of very hard, very sultry, very evil looking women. A mostly brown to black palette. I would have liked artwork with more detail, more scenery, more colors, and an overall softer tone. I was interested to see all the positive reviews here. I don't read a lot of comic books, so maybe that's why I was very put off by it.

0446567337|2.0|The issue of soldiers stationed overseas and all of the issues they deal with related to loneliness and stress about what is going on back home are very serious and important. So while I like the idea and storyline of \\"Dear John\\" I just simply did not think the execution was very good. The writing was amateurish and the characters were all very one-dimensional. I would like to see what a more capable writer could do with this same story.
B003405MF6|5.0|I heard the NPR interview with Leanne Hansen and Jeff, and was blown away by the snippets of tracks I heard. I felt it was the best recording of his career. I then bought this as a birthday present for my ex-husband who is a musicologist in his own right. His Thank You note follows and speaks for itself. WIth his permission I am posting it below as I couldn't have written this better:    \\" Val,    The CD is just extraordinary!!! A monster of a musician at his creative best and surrounded by tons of other great talent!    All the tracks are worthy of listening to over and over again. I guess I  can single out several favorites like the first track called \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" (very tasty). Then there is \\"Over the Rainbow\\" (elegant and lovely). Then the old Screaming Jay Hawkins tune, \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" (gutsy and a great vocal by the Joss Stone). The track \\"Serene\\" is! And the last tune \\"Elegy for Dunkirk\\" is amazingly haunting and  beautiful!     But the tune that just totally blows me away is \\"Nessun Dorma\\" from Puccini's \\"Turandot\\", it made me cry just like when I heard it sung by Caruso, Pavoratti, Placido Domingo, Richard Tucker, Mario Lanza,and other legendary tenors at the top of their talents. Jeff's playing is tone perfect and so incredibly emotionally moving that I listened to it over and over and was just thrilled every time.    So I love it! Thanks so much for the present and the thought behind it!    love,   Lance \\"

B001WCN232|5.0|This is a good sounding record, a little better than the original release, but not a whole lot.  However, this is a great record and a must for a Rolling Stones collector.  This is the record that revitalized my interest in the Stones when Angie came out.  Some really great songs on this record.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|This knife seemed durable and well made for the price point. As a \\"brutish\\" tool around the homestead it should do fine. For long backpacking adventures or hunting it's too large, in both weight and width, and lacks finesse. I have big hands and the grips seemed too wide and easily became slippery with sweat. I hated the sheath as you need extra attachments to make it useful out of the box as it flops around on a normal belt. The coating comes off with ease, so whats the purpose of it really.    I settled for the Fallkniven F1 which was lighter, versatile, corrosion resistant and had better grip. It partners with a Martindale Golok when needed. The Becker is not bad, but for a little more money there are better knives.    Amazon let me return it, no problems. I haven't had bad customer service from Amazon yet.

B000006OHL|5.0|Bernard Herrmann is without question one of if not the best tv and film composers of all time. This was in fact is last effort and it proves to be another masterpiece. The suspense and mystery that he managed to create is unlike any other. There are many other fine articles on this work so I won't rehash all the previously written praises of this great composer. I hear hints of Seventh Voyage of Sinbad and Journey To The Center of The Earth within the framework of this score, which for me is fantastic. He seemed for me to be at his absolute best when working within the suspense/mystery/thriller and fantasy tv and film score format. Some of my favorites and I do love them all are, Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, Journey To The Center of The Earth, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, North by Northwest, ofcourse Psycho and The Twilight Zone and now I add this masterpiece to the collection. If you are a fan of incredible tv and film music scores or a Bernard Herrmann fan you must add this piece of work to your music library. Get it today if you don't already own it.<br /><br />John W. Shearer
B002ZG994U|1.0|Are you serious?    In a review By  Tarun Chachra \\"Tarun Chachra you say. Do not compare this movie to the original show, but then you say    \\"The cast, in my opinion, is dead on and makes every character portray the original cast from the TV show. There are some great catch phrases in the movie that make it fun. There is a lot of CGI in the movie but it is done quite well and makes the action sequences feel as if they were pretty darned close to real. \\"    So you compared them to the original right out of the box. Oh course people are going to compare them to the original. Most of the characters were good matches, but NOT Mr. T. The action scenes while heavy on the blowing things up, were beyond fake. And then the commentary during the action was just as bad. I will only give one example:     when the team gets their plane shot down and they jump into the tank. Face says it is stuffy boss I am going to open a window. He opens the hatch of the tank and starts firing at predator drones. Then because they are falling to earth and going to die, they start to fire the main gun to get to a lake. Okay, while yes this does move the tank, Hannibal said it was 16 miles away! Then the poor acting continues, so the military base can see they are firing the main gun and say are they trying to shot the drone with the main gun? Then the woman says No they are trying to fly the tank. Not to mention their helicopter scene that avoids two missiles.     ARE YOU SERIOUS!     I completely agree with the other reviewer who said this movie is not based on any form of reality. While YES I know you go to the movies to be entertained. This was so far off, I actually started to laugh. I had to keep myself quite. Again. I agree with the other reviewer. It would be a great movie if you were baked!    Alpha Mike Fox-NOT!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's career has been in a constant whirlwind ranging from legal battles with former bandmates, legal battles over subliminal message disputes being the cause of suicides, the death of Randy Rhoads, the highly successful yet highly loathed Osbournes tv show, drugs, nearly murdering his wife, etc. All this while continuing to make great music and attempting to stay sober. You're likely asking \\"does Scream measure up to Ozzy's previous albums?\\" Hell yes, it does. Now, everybody has their own favorites with mine being Blizzard Of Ozz, Diary Of A Mad Man, No Rest For The Wicked, No More Tears, Ozzmosis, and Black Rain. To me, Scream is kind of Black Rain times 1000. The Ozzman was happy with the production on Black Rain, and he wanted to use the template from that album, and build up from there to make a better record. While he definitely didn't want to make the same thing twice, I feel that he hasn't forgotten about what's made his previous material good. You'll also catch some very different sounds on this record including a few Sabbath moments here and there. Also for Zakk Wylde fans, this is the first album in which he did not play. In his place is Firewind guitarist Gus G. Wylde is one hell of a musician, but if you haven't heard Gus play, he is unbelievable. I hope that he sticks around long enough for the next album. Is Scream the best album of the year? Probably not. Is it his best? Likely so. If you're an Ozzy fan, you need to get Scream. It's that easy.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Abbey Road shimmers against anything that came before it, or anything that came after it. Remarkable performances captured for all of time. Its joyful and melancholy, gritty and polished, and a lasting masterpiece. The Beatles were the hardest working band since their inception. There are legions of pretenders whose whole career wouldn't even add up to side 1 of this album. The Beatles musical palette is still the envy of the industry. There was always something for everybody and everyone was invited to join in. The Beatles were the original big tent and tell me how many other groups does anyone ever ask \\" who was your favorite member\\"? Since they never got to follow up this album, \\"its been a long cold lonely winter\\"....
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I had low expectations going into this but I was very pleased with the story, characters and mis en scene.  Worth watching.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|We have followed Supernatural since the beginning.  I don't think we've ever actually missed an episode.  This series is awesome.  If you liked X files, the Fringe...  if you like things that go bump in the night, or if you grew up on Are you Afraid of the Dark on Nickelodeon, this is a fantastic show to watch. You will not be disappointed.    And with Season 4, it just kept it going. We get into a bit more of the lore, especially with Dean's returning, but the lore and the story never distracts from everything else.  that is where X Files stumbled.  It lost its way in its own mythology.  if you hadn't watched the show you couldn't pick it up.        I will not put spoilers here, but it's fantastic.  The lore and mythology behind the monsters, goblins, the baddies, is all fairly accurate.  the writers for the show have made sure that they do their homework.        This season also is home to the episode Family Remains, which in my book rivals  the X Files' Home (the banned episode with the Peacock Family, also from season 4 interestingly enough) in all out creepiness.        excellent show.  Excellent season.  Still Awesome.
B00003CXB4|3.0|I had purchesed the Lion King DVD for my 15 year old niece.  This is her favorite movie of all times.  There was a problem with the DVD, the special edition portion of the DVD was fine but the original version there was no audio.
0446569895|5.0|I love Ozzy!  I always have.  I loved him even more when The Osbournes came out on TV.  I love him even more after reading this book!  He is f'ing hilarious.  The book is written exactly how he talks - you can almost picture him sitting beside you telling these stories.  I laughed out loud throughout the book.  Some parts are unsettling, like the stories of when he worked in the slaughter house.  According to him - the only job he liked and was good at.  I find him fascinating and am amazed that he's still alive after some of the stories in this book.  I thought the book was great and if you like Ozzy or are even curious about him, you should give this a read.
B003ASLJQS|2.0|Listen, I am all for the depressing and brooding dramas that tend to infiltrate my own video library.  I love a film that captures the darkness in life.  That said, there is a fine line a film must be cautious not to cross before it loses the naturalness needed to convey the raw emotions it is attempting to stir up.  `Mystic River' is so dark and so stern in its delivery that it becomes pretentious.<br /><br />The film tells the story of three friends, born and raised Boston, who witness (and suffer) a terrible crime in their youth that leaves them all scarred to varying degrees.  In their adulthood, they have all taken separate paths but they are soon all going to be thrown back into one another's lives when a murder shakes their community, and their families, to the core.  After the murder the lives of these three men (two of them in particular) spirals out of control in a sea of crime, abuse, accusations and murder.<br /><br />From beginning to end, this film wears an impenetrable frown.<br /><br />One of the films major disappointments comes in the form of its `all too highly praised' cast.  The acting in this film is far from three-dimensional, which is a big detraction from this film.  A film of this nature (one that is drenched in turmoil) needs to have characters that feel real and relatable and fully fleshed out.  Outside of Dave Boyle (portrayed with ambiguous fervor by Tim Robbins), this film is inhabited with mere caricatures.  Actresses Laura Linney and Miss Harden (two VERY fine actresses) are saddled with characters who seem stuck in one solitary note, never wavering from their immediate emotional stance.  Kevin Bacon has one of the films more poignant character arcs, yet his character is given nothing more than a side-glance by the director, who seems less concerned with allowing us to feel the weight of the story's core and more concerned with lathering us up with wet and sticky distress.  And then you have OSCAR WINNER Sean Penn who hams up the screen with such an uneven and unfocused variation of emotional disturbance.  I'm actually offended at the praise this performance has garnered, for it lacks any and all subtlety, which is needed to make this character remotely believable.  Instead of layering Jimmy, Penn went to `easy' route and just saddled him with expected emotional outbursts that diminish his character's authenticity.<br /><br />This film kind of makes me mad the more I think about it.<br /><br />In the end, I just can't muster up a reason to recommend this to anyone.  I found Tim Robbins to be heartbreaking and sincere, even if I found his characters eventual arc to be a tad lazy.  I, in fact, hated the films ending, NOT because it was frustrating or `unfair' but because it wasn't explored or given the attention needed to flesh out its poignant message.  I can see it there, under the surface, waiting to make itself known, but Clint Eastwood obviously couldn't be bothered with making this film `important'.n and unfocused variation of emotional disturbance.

0393057658|5.0|Money Ball is an excellent evaluation of the use of statistics in persuing baseball players; as well as personalities, writers, critics, etc. of the \\"game\\". Being rather a novice in sports, I just enjoyed watching and cheering for teams/players, this book gave me a lot to think about and made watching that much better. This book will give you a more intense look at not only the GAME but also what might constitute prospective players, at all levels.

B00005JKMQ|3.0|I really wanted to LOVE this movie.  Even all these years later, I felt the need to give it another try, hoping that I would fall in love with it.  I have a fascination with boxing and biopics, and so this seemed to be right up my ally.<br /><br />It wasn't.<br /><br />I'll go ahead and get the good out of the way before I lay in to this film.<br /><br />Will Smith is simply brilliant.  The material may not always give him the best to work with (why is it that Smith's films constantly fail him?) but he really works magic with what he is given.  From the mannerisms to the physicality to the voice to the sheer magnetic drive, Smith understands Ali and delivers a mesmerizing performance that never once feels like cheap mimicry.  He is creating a character for us, despite the obvious `factual' draw.  The rest of the cast is hit or miss (Voight is a miss, Foxx is a hit) but they don't really matter when you consider the fact that this is Smith's show.  I also (somewhat) appreciate Michael Mann's direction here.  There is a gritty realism that Mann brings to some of his films (`The Insider' is a perfect example of this), and he brings that here as well.  I appreciate that Mann is NOT trying to be Oliver Stone (thankfully) but he does at times find himself hindered in areas that feel very much like Stone-failures here, but overall I think that his sharp direction (while no where near as polished as his work in `Heat' or even `Collateral') helps elevate `Ali' in areas where it certainly needs a boost.<br /><br />And then, there is the bad.<br /><br />Like I kind of already mentioned, Mann's direction is not without its flaws.  I think it's more his vision than his actual direction, but he seems to get muddled in his own viewpoint.  The film, at times, meanders around without any real solidified purpose.  It just kind of hangs there.  In fact, the film takes quite some time even to start establishing character, which was a poor decision, and then when it does attempt to build on WHO and WHAT Ali was, it can get a little uneven and lazy.  What I love so much about biopics is that they can really flesh out the soul of someone you admire or at least harbor some interest in, but `Ali' comes off a tad scattered and unfocused to really do that.<br /><br />In the end, `Ali' fails to really live up to the name.  It needed a sharper edit and a tighter script to deliver a swifter punch in order to make it really do the subject justice.  Smith is simply marvelous, and so one should see it for his engrossing performance, but don't expect this to deliver in a totally fulfilling sense.t a little uneven and lazy.

This third tale continues about the toys, Woody, Buzz and Jessie, plus all their pals is touching and emotional.  Seeing Andy, their owner, grown up and leaving for college, no longer needing them is sad.  His childhood has past, there are pictures in his room of former play-times with the toys, but the toys are now packed away to be stored in the attic.  The toys strike out on their own and end up at a Day Care Center with rough play times and the tough Teddy Bear boss, makes sure they stay.<br /><br />What happens when boys grow up and toys are no longer needed?

A novel of ideas and of characters that will lead you to ask questions about power, the role of religion for an individual and a society, and what possibilities exist if human beings give themselves over to ideas and plans greater than themselves.  Dune is a story to big for any adaptation to do it credit, read it.

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|I gave 4 stars because Star Trek is the best and the idea of the new FX into the old footage is inspired. But the Blu Ray conversion on these episodes isn't that great. Neither are the new FX. They could have done so much with this production idea but all they did was generate new looking ships with no detail.     The ships have such little detail in fact that they look like prototypes or work in progress ships. These FX are far inferior to the old movie's because in the movie's the ships had detail. The new FX are better than the old TV show FX but it's obvious that these guys at paramount got lazy.     Star Trek is one of the most inventive of all time. Paramount pictures are just lazy money grubbers who want to keep re-packaging these old episodes with no added value. 5 stars for Star Trek. 2 stars for the Blu Rays.

0385523386|5.0|I just finished this book on the recommendation of Jen Lancaster (Such a Pretty Fat).  Orange is the New Black was fantastic!  I could not put it down and ironically didn't want to leave Piper's characters at Danbury Federal Prison Camp.    This memoir is a rich detailed description of the community a group of women create no matter where they find themselves.  From the donation of personal items from one stranger to another to the creativity of birthday parties and \\"home cooked meals\\", this group of women come together to make a sort of normalcy and family while locked away from their own.    I can't do justice to this wonderful memoir but please see for yourself by starting it today.  I do not usually read memoirs but both Jen Lancaster and Piper Kerman have convinced me that I have been overlooking a rich genre filled with treasures.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|\\"Oh my God! He's so hot when he's wet!\\" was the first thing I heard from the squealing 13 year old girl seated next to me as this movie started in the theater, and yes, Percy Jackson (the son of Poseidon) was frequently wet throughout this movie.  I also heard other variations on this exclamation, ranging from \\"He's so hot when he sweats\\" to \\"He's even hot when he bleeds!\\" and although I agreed wholeheartedly with the young lady to my left, this movie has a lot more going for it than the fantastic eye candy that is Logan Lerman.    The movie is a great adventure filled with plenty of suspense and cleaver and funny dialogue.  It also includes one of my favorite scenes in a movie released within the last five years, which I will only describe with the words \\"Poker Face\\" so as not to spoil it for any new viewers.      Yes, there are a several over-the-top or wooden performances from a few of the adult actors (Pierce Brosnan, coming off as more of a creepy child molester than the Dumbledore-like figure of wisdom and guidance he hopes to be) but the young actors playing Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Luke were fantastic in their roles.      This movie was so much fun; I wound up seeing it 4 times in the theater with a friend of mine who also fell in love with it.  I had never read the books before, but I am grateful to this movie for inspiring me to read the Percy Jackson series, which is better quality than the film.  However, as far as entertainment value goes, you can't beat this movie.
1579128149|4.0|This book is really a pearl! However, I do not give it five stars for a very simple reason: The author just forgot to include at least one complete periodic table in the book !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, there are small and colorful diagrams in the first few pages explaining 'the basics' but no complete periodic table for continuous reference (with symbols, atomic numbers, masses, etc...). A major flaw in my opinion, especially when dealing with 'the elements'.  Yes, he went on to talk about orbitals, atomic radius and emission spectrums...but where is the basic periodic table?!  Well, do not trust me...go to any book store and check by yourself.  A    Suggestions for future editions:    1. Units for the atomic emission spectrum and state of matter columns...  2. Melting and boiling points (put the numbers there...difficult to see the differences by checking those columns).  3. Talk a little about Mendeleev, the father of the periodic table! And perhaps put side by side his original table and the modern one. So, readers can appreciate how much we have learnt...
B00012FXB8|4.0|For all my reviews visit my website [...]    I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.    Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.    When things started to get controversial    I personally liked it, but I didn't love it like the first two. Wow, they really had Sigourney Weaver shave her head for this movie.  One bad thing is that there is only one alien again, but that isn't a big deal. The big thing that struck me was the change in Ripley's mood. The second half she is good maybe even a little too good, but through the second half of the first half she acts too happy. I don't like it, she's supposed to be depressed the entire film! (Okay, calm down the spoiled reviewer act Ca$hman.)    The idea of an all male Christian planet is okay, but it serves too much power in this film and not enough focus on the Alien. Plus, we need to know how the heck they would have babies?! They haven't seen a women for hundreds of years right? Well, that's not something to focus on too hard, this is Science Fiction after all.    Something else I didn't like was the fact that they didn't tell us it was a queen till a long time in, which made me think they totally ripped on the original Alien concept. Ya know, how when it hatches it's already an Alien and not a baby. But, ya know. Now, some things I did LIKE about it was it didn't lack too bad on the gore and scares. In fact, the beginning was SUPER scary, very very well done and freighting. The gore is another story but, we'll leave that up for debate. (I don't get involved in politics.)    The characters are great, outside of the main idea, specifically they are great characters. They all have these great personalities that just stand out and are fantastic. I was right by the way, you can have rock music in an action sequence and make it look like it was done by a proffessional. I liked how they revived Bishop for the film, and then revived his actor in the designer (or android, I couldn't tell.) But you really gotta look out for the ending.    The Rating? 3.8/5    I, Da Ca$hman signing off,
B003KUSUG8|1.0|First off, the music is horrible. It is as equally generic as everything else on the radio, which is why this album fits so perfectly into a line-up consisting of today's most commercially successful artists (Lady Gaga, Black Eyed Peas, Rhianna, Drake etc.). This album is home to some of the weakest drums I have ever heard (\\"No Love\\", \\"Not Afraid\\") as well as some of the most bland guitar riffs (\\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\", \\"Space Bound\\"). In addition to this, the music does not even attain a rap sound. The only element remotely reflective of the art of hip-hop producing is the sampling. Even then, chopping up Haddaway's \\"What Is Love\\" is one of the poorest excuses for a sample I have heard yet, worse than Puff Daddy sampling The Police. There is nothing great, innovative, or enjoyable about the music on \\"Recovery\\" whatsoever. If the music on \\"Recovery\\" is not bad, then all music is good.    I will say that Eminem's style of rapping on this album is more tolerable than that of \\"Relapse\\". Of course, that's not saying much. First off, the way he structures his rhymes does not make for a good flow. On \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\", the way he delivers \\"God it...feels like I'm going psychotic\\" results in a bad rhyme. Second, his content is ridiculous:  1. Shouting out Kanye West, T.I., and Lil' Wayne numerous times.  2. Overstating how much he does not care for \\"Relapse\\".  3. Blaming his last two albums (which also failed miserably on the artistic level) on drug addiction (\\"The last two didn't count/ 'Encore' I was on drugs, 'Relapse' I was flushing 'em out/\\"), as if he was not incredibly high during the recordings of \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" (he was on marijuana, mushrooms, ecstasy).  4. In general, none of the song's concepts are creative. \\"25 To Life\\" - where he personifies hip-hop as a woman (something Common Sense did with much more taste 16 years ago), \\"W.T.P.\\" - the recycled idea regarding his 8 Mile origins.  5. His vocal performance on the album results ina lousy attempt to \\"reach out\\" or \\"touch\\" the listener, making for an in general trite emotion, which is clearly heard in his singing.    His singing, along with the guest artists' singing is very unimpressive - the singing on \\"Not Afraid\\", \\"Won't Back Down\\", \\"Cold Wind Blows\\", \\"Cinderella Man\\" (what is this?), really any track on the record. On \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\", \\"Kobe\\" overly dramatizes the not so intense idea of talking to oneself during the chorus. In conclusion, the singing on the album is simply overdone and not good.    \\"Recovery\\" is everything Eminem strived not to be ten years ago, everything he so passionately criticized - generic, bubblegum pop, and worst of all (if you had asked him in 2000) corny.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|i cannot go on enough on how great this  CD is. cyndi lauper sounds great, the band is top notch, as well as  the song choices. now this is some serious, bluesy, music. the  minute i put the CD in i knew it---this is  gonna deliever. very mature, soulful, with a  all star backing band. she should be proud because she did this  right!  great to have a fresh sound from a classic artists. i love this!
B0012GMV4O|5.0|Mountain was an aptly named band.  From the imposing size of co-frontman Leslie West-I saw them in concert several times in the '70's, and when West would turn his back on the audience to tune his guitar or fiddle with his amp settings, you couldn't see the neck of his guitar!  It was blocked by West's mountainous upper body.    To the overall sound of the band; massive, heavy, thick, but also very beautiful at times.  The first two songs are the perfect introduction to this band.  The album, of course, opens with \\"Mississippi Queen\\".  Oh my God.  More cowbell!!  If you listen to this song at high volume while driving, you will feel an irresistable urge to press the accelerator to the floor.  Nuff said.    This is followed by \\"Theme From an Imaginary Western\\", by the great Jack Bruce.  Felix Pappalardi's vocal is beautifully done, and Leslie West's guitar solo is one for the ages.  What tone and economy of playing!  Most rock guitarists today play as if they got paid by the note.  They could learn a thing or two here.  As Louis Armstrong, another master of economy once said, \\"Some guys have to play 100 notes to get one good one\\".    Of course there are other standout cuts here, the rave-up \\"Never in My Life\\", and \\"For Yasgur's Farm\\", featuring the yin and yang of Pappalardi singing the verses, and West singing the choruses, to great effect.  This is one \\"Classic Rock\\" album worthy of the name.  Play it loud.

1594202249|4.0|\\"Doc\\" Sportelo is a soft-boiled private investigator working the wide open territory of southern California during the psychedelic early `70s.  An old girlfriend asks him to investigate the disappearance of an unscrupulous businessman whose bodyguard has turned up dead.  Doc's investigations take him on a harrowing ride through various dark corners of the surf scene, often due to the machinations of a police officer called Bigfoot, with whom Doc has an uneasy relationship.  After some crazy plot twists and even crazier women, Doc seems on the verge of uncovering a vast underworld conspiracy known as the Golden Fang.<br /><br />The host of characters made this a fairly confusing tale, but for a Pynchon novel, it all held together pretty well.  There are lots of crazy individual stories, and endless pot smoking, but always in a very active vein - these aren't the kind of druggies who get high and then stare at the TV for 4 hours.  Doc gets run all over the place continually, often by Bigfoot, and he never goes anywhere without smoking on the way.  Ultimately, we have to believe that Bigfoot is one of the good guys as well, although he has a nasty habit of manipulating things so that the pot-smoking hippie freaks take all the risks that further his agenda.<br /><br />Essentially, Doc (as well as some of the other characters depicted in the work) is an idealist: he's bought into the easy living, pot-smoking, wave chasing surfer lifestyle and would never trade it to be a buttoned-down working slob, chasing the almighty dollar.  His P.I. business is mainly about getting women and trying to help people in need, not about getting rich.  And so we can't be too surprised that despite some tense moments, things wind up working out pretty well for Doc.<br /><br />This novel could be thought of as a Pynchon-light, since it's so accessible, and it's undeniably a period piece as well.  The main thrust seems to be that the lines between good and evil are easily blurred, and even the nastiest trouble-makers have the capacity for redemption.  Beyond that there isn't much of a message here.  But if you're not too prudish for Pynchon's brand of sex and drugs and surf rock, this is a pretty enjoyable read that makes a decent introduction to a very talented writer.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I DONWLOADED THIS ALBUM WHEN IT LEACKED AND AS SOON AS IT WAS AVAILABLE.. I HAD TO PURCHASE IT.... THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!! NO DOUBT EMINEM IS ONE OF THE BEST RAPPER EVER!! THE WHOLE ALBUM IS A 10/10
B003JYOFIW|4.0|Sounding more invigorated and fresh than we should have expected at this point in time, Devo deliver \\"Something For Everybody,\\" their market tested, fan voted and 80% focus group approved first disc in two decades. Given the state of the world and the state of the musical art, it sounds like they haven't aged a day.<br /><br />From the pomp blare that blows open \\"Fresh\\" to the sythed-shouted call to arms of \\"March On,\\" this is the irony drenched and jittery synth-rock these guys all but perfected in the 70's and 80's. There's even a snotty political broadside via the title track. And as they say on \\"Later Is Now,\\" eventually everyone gets it right. The future really has caught up to Devo. There's plenty of humor, snark (both at once in \\"Don't Shoot, I'm a Man\\") and irresistible dance beats, even if you think you've heard it all before. Well, you have. As they call their publishing \\"Recombinant Music;\\" you'll still dig it.<br /><br />At the same time, there's one song here that marks a high-water mark for Devo. \\"No Place Like Home\\" is, of all things, a piano ballad at its heart. Not just a piano ballad, but an honest to spud-pete \\"Save The World\\" song. While \\"Beautiful World\\" and \\"Freedom of Choice\\" were topical in a more underhanded way, \\"No Place Like Home\\" goes straight for the jugular, arguing that the pure devolution's endgame is extinction. It's also the song I heard didn't make the Song Study cut, but the band put it on the disc anyway.<br /><br />Pretty potent stuff, but the irony of all ironies is that Devo has grown up. \\"Something For Everybody\\" may have a few duds (\\"Cameo\\" is my pick for most replaceable song), yet I am still in awe that this album is as strikingly good as it turned out. \\"On with the show,\\" they bellow at the close of \\"March On.\\" And I couldn't agree more.
0743299795|4.0|This book was a great introduction to the concept of lean manufacturing. The writing style of the book is comprehensive enough to be useful for current managers, yet readable enough to be engaging for those who are new (i.e. students) to these concepts. Those who are more savvy in the area of operations and supply management may find the book a bit repetitive in some areas.    Although the book focuses on auto manufacturers (mainly Toyota), a reader should not expect a detailed account of Toyota's supply chain or operations management, but rather a survey of concepts and a view of how Toyota has applied these methods and/or how other auto manufacturers have lagged on applying these techniques. The book provides many comparisons to assist the reader in understanding (the general approach per chapter is to give an overview of the mass production system, and then give its improved lean production counterpart). The book does not give any practically methodology on how to convert a non-lean production system over to a lean one, but there are many other books out there that can delve into this further.    If you are looking for a book to introduce you to lean production, written in laymen's terms, using a model that almost all of us can understand I strongly recommend this book. However, you will need more background/research than this book provides to actually apply lean operations methodologies if you so desire.
B003P8D6JQ|5.0|I was sceptical about buying this soundtrack. I have the other 2 soundtracks from the previous movies.  They are..ok..---but they have really stepped up with this one.  Not so many depressing songs. Lots of fun and really cool!
0984334904|5.0|These cards are extremely well designed.  The operative kanji is located in the upper left in a huge font face.  The stroke order is listed in a series of step-by-step pictures below the kanji.  Perhaps most helpfully, various uses of the kanji are located to the right of the operative kanji, which makes practicing the various readings quite easy.      Just as importantly, these cards are built to last.  They are the equivalent of high quality, laminated playing cards:  thick, wear-and-tear resistant, and they shuffle easily.  The only flaw I can even imagine with these cards is that the stroke order doesn't indicate the point of origin (that is, you can see each step-by-step stroke, but it doesn't indicate if you start on, say, the left hand side and move to the right or vice versa).  I had reason to contact the company about some replacement cards, and they responded quickly, helpfully, and without reservation.  A company that actually stands by its products?  What a relief!     I already ordered the next box of kanji, and I fully expect to eventually graduate to the massive JLPT level 1 kanji set offered by White Rabbit.  Simply put, it's a great product without any significant flaws.

B0006PV5VC|5.0|Reiner's conducting and arrangement of this classic is, for me, the definitive version.  The performance is stunning.  The quality of the recording is such that its hard to believe that this performance is almost 50 years old.  A must buy.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I saw the Stones on this release tour (JFK, 7/4/72). So for many of these songs I still can remember the stage performances. I wore out my vinyl copy decades ago and have purchased all previous CD releases. But this version is crisp and better balanced. But some of the basement tracks are a messy recording mix that I have come to love and they have preserved that gritty feel. Could be the Stones at their best. Certainly one of the 10 best rock albums of that era.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|For those who are fans of this artist, it is a good fit.  For the general public, this will have a few singles that get airplay.  Most people are drawn to  music first for the music and will later become attached to the lyrics, hence the reason you are able to hum a tune but may not be able to remember the words.      Giving this disc a  listen, the lyrics have some depth and color.  The beats are good, but are missing that touch that Dre brings when filling the role of producer.      All in all, a solid release. Don't know if this one has the legs of some of his other more popular releases.  Fans will dig it.    **FOLLOW UP*** _ July 4 -  After two more listens, changed to a 5 star review.  A great disc.  Great production.  This one has legs kids!

B001GCUO5W|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />Scorsese had all the right ideas here, but at 140 minutes this was 30 too long for my taste, and didn't leave me feeling anything but somewhat disappointed, despite fine performances and a good story.<br /><br />DiCaprio is excellent as usual, as is Kingsley, but the script takes too long to unfold, and after a while I began to smell the coming twist {spoilers on the way}. The bummer for me is that this film flirts with the incredible cinematic potential of the MK Ultra project, but backs off just when it could truly have broken new ground. Jacob's Ladder addresses many of the themes here much more convincingly, and if you liked this make sure to see that one. Both JL and Fight Club came to mind while watching this, but both of those brought it all home with much more weight.<br /><br />This film looks very fine on blu-ray, and the subtle CGI adds to the paranoid feel. The music is rather too obvious and telegraphic, but clearly that was the idea. MS sure knows how to move a camera and compose a shot, truly a master. But this one needed way more editing to have the impact it wanted, and it all drags long enough that the ending is more a relief than a surprise.<br /><br />Back to the MK Ultra theme, and the brief nod to Operation Paperclip (look them up if you don't know of them, and prepare to learn some incredible American history they left out of your schoolbooks): these are topics that are DYING to be turned into a truly classic film, and Scorsese is a perfect candidate. For a while here I was thrilled to think that these vital missing links in our post-war history would finally be looked at in depth, but they're merely passing fragments. Come on, Marty! You or Francis could make a movie about those topics that would change the way we see ourselves as a country, and maybe even influence present political culture for the better...so please do!<br /><br />But in the meantime we get a very good-looking gothic throwaway, based on Lehane's novel but with little of his special touch. The Aviator and The Departed both blow this one out of the water, and while Scorsese and DiCaprio still make a fine team, I'm looking forward to another outing from them of higher quality once again, with more incision and less scattershot intensity.Aviator and The Departed both blow this one out of the water, and while Scorsese and DiCaprio still make a fine team, I'm looking forward to another outing from them of higher quality once again, with more incision and less scattershot intensity.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|I don`t think so Ozzy, I don`t think so. Scream does not sound like a Sabbath album.  The Prince of Darkness`s assertion proved to be wrong. But you know what? It doesn`t matter because I`ll say it right away: Scream is an excellent Ozzy solo album, it probably won`t blow you way however it`s a worthy purchase. His tenth studio album proves to be a very strong one, for that matter I like it better than the Ozzman`s last two albums Black Rain (2007) and Down To Earth (2001) (I didn`t hate either of those albums and liked them for what they were) but that`s just my personal opinion. Originally entitled Soul Sucka the name of the album was changed after negative response from fans, I think Soul Sucka wasn`t the best title choice for Ozzy anyway and Scream is much better. The first time I heard of the then upcoming new Ozzy album was when Zakk Wylde was interviewed about it saying how he was laying down these great riffs for the album. Of course that changed and Firewind`s Gus G filled in for Zakk because Ozzy felt that everything sounded too much like Black Label Society and \\"Fancied a change\\", to quote him. Who thought Ozzy would still be touring and recording after all these years? Not many I believe but he still is and the good thing about it is that the material is great too.<br /><br />Gus G`s guitar playing often reminds me of Zakk here but it`s still different in many ways, nothing to complain at all Gus is an excellent guitar player and with respect to Zakk it`s kind of a nice change. I`m not a fan a Firewind and I don`t know a whole lot about the band but I`ve got to hand it to him and I think most will agree, Gus did a solid job on Scream he can be proud.<br /><br />I won`t go trough every song but here are my comments on a few. I thought right way that the single Let Me Hear You Scream was a strong first pumping anthem type of song, good single and lots of energy. I love the crunchy guitar work that`s a nice touch. If you didn`t like the single don`t worry there are other songs that I think you`ll enjoy much more than that one. Soul Sucka is not a great album title that`s true but as a song it works! Excellent song a highlight of the album, it`s slow heavy and catchy. Crucify is another good, clever lyrics, pure Ozzy would be a way to describe it. Diggin`Me Down I felt was one of the strongest song here, a heavy Ozzy song. I Want It More sounds like something from Black Rain to me, not that it`s bad because I thought it was a good album. Time is one of my fav songs, a very good heavy ballad type of songs with Ozzy reflecting on life and-you guessed it- the time we have on earth. The album ends with I Love You All, basically an epitaph of approximately 1 min, Ozzy says to his fans from the heart \\"God Bless You All, I Love You All\\". It`s not really a song but I found it touching, if you don`t then it does not matter because it doesn`t take anything away from Scream. I just thought it was a good way for Oz to finish Scream.<br /><br />It`s a hard task to compare Scream to Ozzy`s past albums. Some say the man hasn`t done a decent thing since Diary of a Madman back in 1981 and some say his last great album was No More Tears or Ozzmosis, others didn`t like the past two albums so it`s hard to please everyone you know? To be honest I own everything Ozzy has done including the Sabbath material and never hated any of it, I have much respect for the man (The new editions of Blizzard and Diary are coming in 2010 as well, both with the original artists who played on them, glad for that, as well as extras)and his contribution to Metal. On another note I quite like the cover even though I`m not sure what it has to do with the Scream title. I just think it looks cool.<br /><br />Ok in the end it`s not a five star album but there are enough great moments and highlights to make it deserve a four in my opinion, I guess if I were a fanatic I`d give it a five, I`m just trying to stay objective here. I don`t know what your anticipations were for Scream but I wasn`t deceived!It probably won`t please anyone but I enjoy it. Scream was leaked on the internet a little before it`s official release and so some of us, including me, got a chance to hear the album early (I still went and bought the album the day of release).  It`s unclear as of yet if this will be Ozz`s final album, in fact the track I Love You All may lead you to think this but with Ozz you can never be too sure, we may see more material in the future. If there is new material to come I`d like to see Ozzy reunite with Zakk (he probably will, if you remember Zakk didn`t play on the Ozzmosis tour), after all he was Ozzy`s guitarist for a little over 20 years and I think it would be the best way to end it all (a Sabbath reunion would be nice thought, who knows maybe it will happen someday).

B003K025V4|2.0|These boring songs are not only a variation on the same theme over and over again (Miley misses a guy) but are at times inappropriate for her age. There may be 2 or 3 that are a little catchy.  If you like \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" then you'll be disappointed because most of the album mixes slow songs with forgettable upbeat songs. Download the ones you like (which won't be many) and skip the rest.    The cover photo is also totally wrong for an 11th grader.  This girl jumped the shark and is making some bad career choices. The CD will disappoint the tween fans and it's not interesting enough for the adults she is try to reach out to.

I have read about a 1,000 books and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is the reason that I will rate many a great book will only 4 stars.     I have no idea who could play the part of Atticus Finch in a remake but, Mayella Ewell could be played by Paris Hilton.     Either way get a copy and read it, take if from an avid reader this is some good stuff.
0151003084|5.0|An ABC book limited to a few lines per page.  Written as a poem, so clever.  Typical Gorey illustrations. A little gem of an offering. I purchased a copy for my 26 year old son for Christmas.  My 5 year old nephew was there and asked that the book be read to him...over... and over...and over...and over....  I purchased him his own copy. Quintessential Gorey.

B001IF252C|1.0|I have been using Macs since the original Macintosh 128k, and this is probably the worst item Apple has ever sold me. Even as I write this review on my MacBook Pro (Yes, seriously! I just now had to unplug/replug the cable.) the graphics on my Dell 30\\" monitor become garbled and distorted. The monitor has worked perfectly with all other computers, including a MacBook Pro with a DVI port. The computer has worked perfectly when not using the adapter. I also got the adapter exchanged just a few days ago, and the problem persists, despite Apple knowing about this for at least a year. This is an inadequate product, and I am sad to recommend anyone who needs to use a computer with a 30\\" screen NOT to buy an Apple computer with a Mini DisplayPort.
B00000JNNY|5.0|My new love selected this gorgeous song for us; it fits our new relationship perfectly.    He heard it on a CD & called me from Arizona to play it & tell me that \\"This will be our song forever\\".   I even learned to play it on the piano.
0307454541|5.0|Halldor Laxness meets Dan Brown meets Stephen King.  Loved the atmosphere, which is so deftly created with small details (e.g. all the coffee). Roughly 100 pages are pretty seriously flawed (I won't say which), but that leaves about 550 that are near perfect.
B003KUSUSQ|5.0|I consider myself an Eminem fan, but not nearly as much of a fan as I was back in 2002 when \\"The Eminem Show\\" came out. But then I heard \\"Love The Way You Lie\\", and I sat up and paid attention.<br />The track not only features solid production by Alex Da Kid, but an emotional hook sung by Rihanna. This beautifully written hook was penned by Skylar Grey, whom according to a reliable source has been signed by Alex Da Kid in what is his first production deal. After hearing this track, I know I'll be keeping an ear open for what Ms. Grey brings us next. In the meantime, I hope \\"Love The Way You Lie\\" gets slated for the next album single.
B003ICWTR4|3.0|While Mr Springsteen and his band of merry musicians have earned their spot in the pantheon of popular music, their propensity to haul out the same show periodically needs to be put to rest. There is enough media for the uninitiated to get a sense of where they've come from and provide a drop of variety to the performance. Bruce has earned the right to explore many avenues as he has on the Seeger sessions, Nebraska, and so on without having to resort to the jukebox hero performances that have come to highlight his most recent efforts. Energy and passion are high at any show in any venue where he performs and it is doubtful that this will ever change. I'm waiting for the wordplay of his first two releases to make a return to his writing but that's one fool's opinion. Finally, I struggle to understand how he and his camp missed the irony of bloated millionaires trying to perform London Calling with any urgency or relevance the original group unleashed on an unsuspecting world. Enjoy as you will but beware the emperor's clothes.
0061122416|1.0|Two Thumbs down. Worst book I have red in a long time. Or ever for that matter. Pretentious, pseudo-spiritual drivel, that tries way to hard and reads like it was written by a 5th grader. \\"The Soul of the World spoke to the Heart of the Boy as he prayed to the God of the Dessert who commanded the Spirit of the Wind...\\" please. NO idea why so many people recommend it. Sure the message is an ok one, but nothing life changing as the book pretentiously likes to claim. I already know to work steadily to my goals and I know it's true that all goals are attainable if you know what you want, work hard enough on them and stay focused. But, not all of it 'lessons' I agree with. It focuses on material gain and to shed ALL attachments to pursue a goal (i.e fame. money: two of the Least important things for happiness). I think that is incredibly destructive and definitely not the road to enlightenment. What about being grateful and CONTENT for what you have and who you are and how your life is instead of chasing some ultimately meaningless golden treasure? Or any ambition of that matter, not just material, if your ambitions overcome your ability to appreciate what you have it becomes unhealthy. To top that off the writing was just painful to read, very childish, corny dialog, no character depth and cliche, and plot threads that lead nowhere. And not to forget the books sexist slant that encourages men to follow their dreams, while a woman's is supposed to await her man (\\"She never asked you to stay because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man\\" - p. 126) ... No thank you.     I'll stick to Voltaire and the Tao Te Ching,

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I have to admit I didn't really care for Cyndi Lauper's previous albums. I now admit that she's a tremendous singer. She's not faking when she sings the blues. All the musicians on this record are brilliant, from Allen Toussaint to Jonny Lang (Lang is simply amazing as a young musician). This album is a must have. To sum up my feelings while listening these tracks : Emotional rescue !

This is Mayer at his absolute best.  I've seen him live a few times, but he was on FIRE during this show.  While I love the acoustic set and the set with his hits, the JM3 set is where his talent truly shines (the 2005 recordings of the Trio songs pale in comparison).  Please pick up this collection - you will NOT regret it.

0525423842|4.0|Not bad, considering it was his first foray for young readers.  He definitely knows how to write a thriller, and the pages kept turning lickety-split, but still I can just give it a B+.  The premise and set-up were great, and the problem of what to do about your key witness being a frightened, skittish illegal immigrant was perfect (as well as timely).  I had a hard time believing in Theo, though.  I agree with the reviewer in Publishers Weekly who said he was like \\"an adult's projection of what an ideal kid might be like.\\"  He isn't down-to-earth normal enough to be Hank Zipzer (or even Frank or Joe Hardy), nor extraordinary and fantastical enough to be Maniac Magee, although there are elements of both in him.  I think Grisham was perhaps trying for a Magee-like too-good-to-be-true, but in the context of a gritty courtroom procedural, that kind of characterization is nearly impossible to pull off.  I hope he can refine Theo in future stories and somehow make him more authentic.  The premise has tons of possibilities; he just needs to decide what sort of creature Theo will be.  Another hint: scale back the legal textbook paragraphs.  They're helpful but a mite intrusive, and add to my unsettled-ness about Theo: is he a legal scholar nerd or a normal kid who happens to live in a houseful of attorneys?  Bottom line: It's good, name recognition alone will get it loads of attention, and the second or third book in the series will show what the author is capable of as a middle-grade writer; this time around he's basically just getting his sea legs.
B003SWU9R6|5.0|This album deserves 5 stars, because it's different.  It's new ground for Eminem, new production, same great lyrics.  He went back and made an album for hip-hop fans (not rap fans) like Jay-Z did with Blueprint 3.  It was lyrically sound, great delivery, great production 5 stars all the way.
B000EMG9EU|2.0|Ciccone Youth was a one-off side project with Sonic Youth and Mike Watt.  This is their low-brow experimental side at its most lackadasical (as opposed to some of their more inspired experiments).  Sounding like a lazy toss-off done in a day or two in the studio, the disc is an amalgam of quasi-industrial rhythms, guitar skronk, weak hip hop nods and I'm-so-bored detached vocals - it's the least of Sonic Youth, possibly the most inconsequential thing they ever released, and the sort of thing that makes people groan when artistes invoke the word 'deconstruction'.      Madonna has two songs covered as \\"tribute\\" - in 80's-90's parlance that often suggested a cryptic snub [Madonna, herself, was smart enough not to get legal and make the situation worse by picking a fight].  This mess falls into the category of \\"it must have been fun to record it\\", intrinsically implying that its not so great to listen to.  But being sandwiched between two of their most celebrated albums, Sister and Daydream Nation, one can excuse them for figuring out what stuff would sound self-indulgent on a more 'prestige' release. With their SYR series they also wisely exorcise tinkering to keep the albums from being a Sprawl.  For their more abrasive experiments, see Confusion is Sex, which sounds dangerous 30 years later and isn't the least bit dated.    I'm bewildered by the five star reviews... if rabid Sonic Youth fans just give all their records 5 stars and offer little context, it isn't much of a review.  Strictly for completists and definitely not a place for newcomers to start.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|Is it right to question?  Is it proper to doubt?  Is it the question itself, or the questioner, who offends in asking?  These are some of the issues presented in \\"Agora\\", the compelling film by Alejandro Amenabar starring Rachel Weisz.<br /><br />The film presents the fascinating life of the Roman philosopher/mathematician/scientist Hypatia, a neo-Platonist philosopher of 4th century Alexandria.  Very little is known of her scientific or philosophical discoveries, as none of her writings survived the fall of Rome and the rise of Christianity.  What we do know of her comes from other writers of the period, who tell us she was widely regarded as the bright jewel of the empire for her wisdom, virtue and brilliant erudition.  The broader outlines of her life are known, as are the larger historical and cultural context in which she lived.<br /><br />As the film opens, Hypatia is laboring to develop a theory that explains the orbits of the planets in contradiction to the accepted Ptolemaic model of the time.  Amenabar and his writer take a few artistic liberties in his presentation, as he imagines Hypatia's train of thought along these lines in the absence of any documentary evidence.  We just don't know if this was in fact the case. But never mind that, as Art is well served here.<br /><br />Do the planets travel around the earth, or the sun?  Hypatia struggles relentlessly with this question against the backdrop of abrupt and shocking changes in Roman culture.  The early Christians have gained a political foothold with imperial favor, and begin to challenge the Pagans and Jews in the provincial capital.  The confrontations become violent.  As the Christians gain power, they repress any differences of belief and insist on agreement with their faith, often at the point of a sword.  Fascinated with this emerging model of the universe, Hypatia persists in her inquiries in the face of growing danger.<br /><br />Amenabar has created a very convincing Alexandria.  The sets and costumes are wonderful, and the writing is quick and idiomatic.  Rachel Weisz gives another stand-out performance as a genius completely taken up with the creative process of thought.  Weisz's Hypatia is a woman of great perspicacity, intellectual honesty, personal warmth and moral courage.  She gives us the convincing internal struggle with a Really Big Idea, a feat of acting that requires great artistic restraint.  She succeeds admirably.  Hypatia's simple scientific experiments are mesmerizing and charged with drama.  Her intellectual struggles are at the same time rigorous and intuitive, deeply moving, yet not cold or distant. She cares about the people around her as much as her Really Big Idea.  The rest of the cast performs at the same superb level.<br /><br />Much has been said elsewhere about the romantic interests in the film.  Fortunately, these are entirely secondary to the larger contrasts of the emerging cosmological model and the ultimate closing of the Roman mind.  And it is highly refreshing to see a plot driven by a conflict other than the typical Hollywood-formula \\"love interest\\".<br /><br />In life, we know that Hypatia died a martyr to her beliefs.  We also know that this moment in European history marked the beginning of the end of the free-thinking philosophy peculiar to Classical, Hellenistic culture.  Which makes Hypatia's problems quite contemporary, as people everywhere face the same challenge today.  Is it good or right to question?  If history is any judge then it certainly is, because that is the only way one will arrive at the truth.e writing is quick and idiomatic.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|I wanted to pick Mr. Mozart off my lap, put on my Tevas, and run right into the field with the rest of the boys, passing, scratching, kicking, spitting, and opening up the front door of the rough house to New Zealand.  At heart, I shall always be a rugby player but I fear I don't have the long legs and tennis ball like calf muscles to be a contributing member of a team.     But lucky for me, Clint Eastwood has given me a front row seat to the game as well as the locker room antics of this merry group of beer swigging rapscallions.  And there is a very important political message of people working together despite deep hatreds.  Please take note.    Morgan Freeman is impossible to understand, the movie repeats itself around three times over, and the sets look cheap.  I love it.      Am I clear for a goal? Because I'm kicking a Kudos to this fine film.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This is an astonishingly good novel.  I was a bit nervous about getting started because I read for pleasure and I feared the intensity of reading a direct account of The Holocaust and it's effects on children.  That aspect was unflinching but as gentle as is possible for such a dark topic.  The real story was about how everyone touched by that tragedy, even indirectly and 60 years later, is deeply affected for the remainder of their lives.  It is the story of humanity and it's interconnectedness.  You may not realize it, but events like these are part of who you are.  Even if you and your family lived far away from the holocaust in either distance or time. Despite all of this heaviness, I found that was an enjoyable read.  It is heavy but there is a brightness and optimism that infuses the book through the ending.  I'm grateful to have read it.
B0017PCX20|5.0|This is a deliciously disturbing, lusciously arranged, and wildly imaginative collection of songs.

B002ZG994U|5.0|The movie begins in Mexico, where Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson taking the part of George Peppard) is about to get a bullet in the head for bribing (obviously) the wrong cop.  B.A. Baracus (Quinton Jackson taking the part of Mr. T., complete with \\"PITY\\" and \\"FOOL\\" on his knuckles) is down the road a piece, fighting a bunch of dirtbags over his van.  Face (Bradley Cooper, taking the place of Dirk Benedict) is still the ladies' man.  As a matter of fact, he is wedged into several truck tires while some woman's husband is beating him in the face for boinking his wife.  Hannibal and BA arrive just in time to save Face from becoming toast.  Crazy-as-a-bed-bug Murdock is discovered in a hospital while they are getting BA stitched up.  All 4 guys are former Rangers so they bond big time.<br /><br />Murdock is still an unmatched pilot.  BA still has to be medicated to fly.  Hannibal still chomps a cigar.  And Face is still Face.  Right after they cross the border back into the USA, they get involved in trying to acquire some $100 counterfeit plates, being moved by Saddam loyalists from Bagdad, and, oh yeah, over $1 billion in cold phony bills.<br /><br />Much of this 2010 movie is filmed in beautiful Vancouver, Canada.  It's about 2 hours of action and comedy.  Steven Cannell is involved in the production, as with the popular series from the \\"old\\" days.  They kept the integrity of the oh-so-popular series with lots of action and lots of comedy.  There are tons of neat stunts, although some may be pretty close to impossible.  But what the heck--that's what makes a movie like this fun!  We have chopper and airplane stunt flying, action on a container ship, and the strategizing of perfectly timed plans, among other adventures the boys have.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the movie and will most definitely watch it again.  FYI, I do NOT remember any \\"F\\" type language, which is rare today--just lots of action and blow-em-up stuff.<br /><br />I LOVE IT when a movie comes together!<br /><br />Immediately after the credits, you will see a short cameo appearance of the former Face, Dirk Benedict.

B003RNU8KY|5.0|I've long been of the belief that The Roots are not only the best hip hop group out there, but they are one of the top BANDS period.  Of any genre of music.  The Roots have long been one of the more intelligent staples in hip hop, always counted on to come correct with meaningful thought provoking lyrics, and live music.<br /><br />A lot of hip hop is done with computers and whatnot, but make no mistake people: This is a BAND!  One only has to tune in to Jimmy Fallon's show week nights to see them play.<br /><br />This album is a special kind of thing.  The lyrics are on point, as always, the guest appearances aren't necessarily the same ol' same ol' that you see on every hip hop album.  There's no Drake, no Lil Wayne, none of that.  It's real hip hop with real hip hop artists.<br /><br />No talking about killing people, doing drugs, or sleeping with any girl they can get.  This is grown folks hip hop.<br /><br />This album, \\"How I Got Over\\" is unique in that it fits together so cohesively.  There's nothing that feels like filler, here.  It's almost like it blends into the next track, kind of like an album by the group \\"Enigma\\" does.<br /><br />Standout tracks include \\"Now or Never\\" (featuring Phonte of Little Brother and Dice Raw), which is my personal favorite after three times listening to the album, Dear God 2.0 (featuring Monsters of Folk), the title track \\"How I Got Over\\" (featuring Dice Raw) and \\"Walk Alone\\" (featuring Truck North, Dice Raw and someone named P.O.R.N.).<br /><br />Black Thought is solid once again as the frontman of this band, and if you have any semblance of desire to hear true genuine hip hop, then you have to buy this.  There's no ifs ands or buts about it.  Support true hip hop, and not that lame stuff you hear on the radio.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of people complain about the album saying it's too short.  And clocking in at a bit over 41 minutes, it's short compared to many hip hop album out there.  However, for one, there's not a ton of interludes, which tends to pad hip hop albums when the artists have nothing to say, and also, and this is just me personally, but I'd rather have 41 minutes of solid hip hop that has something meaningful and personal to say, than an 80 minute album that's half average at best, and half decent.<br /><br />But that's just me.the artists have nothing to say, and also, and this is just me personally, but I'd rather have 41 minutes of solid hip hop that has something meaningful and personal to say, than an 80 minute album that's half average at best, and half decent.

B003NTSBUG|5.0|I loved this movie. I felt all of the emotions right where the writer intended me to feel them . I hate to figure out what the plot is . I like to just roll with the move. I loved it beginning, middle and end. I totaly understood the ending and thought it was a very smart ending. It's the kind of story that with all the twists and surprises, makes you want to see it again, now that you know the whole story. Of course if you hated it as some people did, you would not feel that way. I will watch it again.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|How I Got Over is reminiscent of older Roots albums; it is consistently potent and musically focused, yet always dynamic and unique. With the exception of Game Theory, no Roots album has had this consistency since the 90s. Every track is good, and fits like a piece of a puzzle into the album, which is 100% listenable. The many featured artists add lots of flavor, the production is tight, and Black Thought is in top form.      Here, as on every album, The Roots redefine their style while somehow remaining true to the musical quest Ahmir and Tariq began decades ago. These tracks are chapters 143 through 156 in the Great Roots Epic, and How I Got Over is one of its best volumes in a while.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|I sadly can't get back the time I wasted on this film.  Matt Damon, one of the most over-rated actors, whose range is A to B, prances about pretending to be a warrior.    The film is racked full of liberal cliches and had they worked into it, some \\"proof\\" that Bush had planted bombs in the WTC to justify the war, I wouldn't have been shocked.    This film will please those people who don't mind politics dressed up as a movie and by those who are hoping the last couple of year's progress in Iraq somehow unravels.    It will be popular in places like Iran, Turkey, and other nations where pork isn't on the menu.      Deservingly, the film flopped.  Don't waste your money on it.
B002ZG997M|1.0|This is one incredible movie and definitely a 4 star movie, but this rating is on the Blu-ray version.  The Blu-Ray is crap.  This disk has a special feature known as \\"Maximum Movie Mode Survival Guide.\\"  It is an excellent add to the movie if you have seen the movie and are interested in watching the making of the movie, live interviews, directors notes, and hand drawn images of costumes and set, while you are watching the main film.  However, this add on is permanent to the Blu-ray and cannot be removed from the movie.  If you want to watch the movie by itself, you are forced to watch the digital copy also included.  Just a suggestion, but if you are a person like me who does not watch the extras but instead buys a DVD or Blu-ray specifically for the movie, by the original dvd and save yourself $10.00.  You can purchase the Blu-ray in about a month or so when it will probably drop in price.

'Sly' is so awesome - makes me think of Still Loving You because of the emotion of the song. 'Best is Yet to Come' is a great way to end the album and it made me think of all the years these guys have put out music. PLEASE DON'T RETIRE! The album is full of melodic rockers too. A few are better than others but there are none that are horrible. Overall, a great album and a very enjoyable listen that I often come back to.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|What more can say about one of the greatest films known to mankind. Psycho finally fifty years later gets the treatment it deserves. Since I was a little boy, buying a ticket to one movie and sneaking into see this movie because of its rating, solidifies itself as being the most contraversial and yet outstandingly perfect film that has ever graced the screen. We learn alot from this film, mostly because it takes us so deep into the darkest of places in the human psyche to really show its colors and even then you still are only given a glipse of what is on screen. The film stays with you for hours, days and even decades. To this day, each and every frame tingle my spine and raise the hairs on my neck. How dare you Mr. Van Sant for even attempting to remake perfection with Psycho (1998), however, all is forgiving we do have \\"MILK\\". In the end you simply can't touch this film, it is perfect in everyway and now it can be seen as it is supposed to be seen.    Norman Bates is one of the most interesting character I think to ever grace the screen. You see you want to know why this film is so good, try having a character that is not only a villian but a misunderstood innocent child at heart and a young man looking for love and companionship. Mr. Bates was a very disturbed individual and its sad how the rest plays out. We all take our own lessons from \\"Psycho\\" and as for Norman...well he wouldn't even harm a fly!    The film itself is a ten in every category including top notch Cinematography, editing, acting, writing, sound and undoubtley its score.

B00125WAWS|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />In \\"The Great Debaters,\\" a true story that takes place in the 1930s, Denzel Washington plays Melvin B. Tolson, a professor at Wiley College, an all-black school in Marshall, Texas.  The movie chronicles his efforts to get his debating team to compete against some of the most prestigious Anglo colleges - including Harvard - in the country.  This was no mean accomplishment, given the intense prejudice and opposition thrown up against the very idea of a \\"white\\" school hosting a black debating squad, particularly in the Jim Crow South.  Tolson was also a furtive union organizer of local sharecroppers, an activity that ultimately got him accused of being a communist in the politically volatile world of the Great Depression.<br /><br />\\"The Great Debaters\\" is a solid, old-fashioned social drama that wears its emotionalism and its \\"squareness\\" proudly on its sleeve.  As director, Washington doesn't indulge in narrative complexities or fancy cinematic flourishes, preferring to let the drama and the temper of the times speak for themselves.  It's true that the characters could use a little more development, but the acting is solid, with Denzel Whitaker winning top honors as James Farmer, Jr., the 16-year-old member of the trio who's torn between his impressive intellect, his innate self-consciousness and his burgeoning puberty.  The first-rate cast is rounded out by Nate Parker and Jurnee Smollet as Henry Lowe and Samantha Booke, the other two members of the team who become romantically involved with one another; Forest Whitaker as James' loving but overbearing father; and John Heard as a bigoted sheriff who has it in for Tolson.<br /><br />The movie ends with a where-they-all-ended-up title-card wrap-up that adds to the movie's inspirational effect.  It's easier to reject the film intellectually than emotionally, since the filmmakers know all the right buttons to push.  That may make the movie overly-manipulative in the long run, but you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by it.be moved by it.

0140157352|5.0|Although it has been a number of years since I first read this book, its wisdom continues to serve as the fundamental framework for the many negotiation opportunities that everyday life sends my way. I continue to recommend this classic primer to anyone who is looking for a foundation for effective negotiating. Its succinct guidance is contained in its four fundamental principles; 1) separate the people from the problem; 2) focus on interests, not positions; 3) generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do, and 4) insist that the result be based on some objective standard. Whatever situations business or family life might send your way, applying these four principles will reliably put you on the path to win-win solutions. \\"Getting to Yes' is an easy read with a powerful and practical message.
0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games was one of the best books I have reviewed on 'Vine' program.  The sequel was every bit as good.  We witness the further loss of innocence, with the corresponding acceptance of responsibility by so many of the characters.  The book sets up for an incredible finish... I can't wait!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes are both wonderful in this book adaptation. The film maybe a little slow for most younger audiences, but overall this film is a treat. With a great story of how real people get caught up in the worst of situations, this emotional thriller is both entertaining and smart. Certainly of the few on my short list for Blu-ray purchases.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy, much like his tenured contemporaries, seems to get pigeon holed and put into a very difficult spot with each release. They've got two options: Go into the studio and do the best they can for the love of the music OR kill themselves trying to live up to standards they set so many decades ago to appease the select few who cling to the past like flies on horse droppings. Personally, I prefer option 1 and because of that, I tend to really enjoy each new album. I've always expected and welcomed change with open arms every time Ozzy enters the studio. I'll get this out of the way early and say that this isn't Blizzard of Ozz Jr. or Diary of a Madman Pt. II and there isn't a single Mr. Crowley, Over the Mountain or You Can't Kill Rock n Roll reprise. If for some ungodly reason you're still expecting that 30 years later, don't even bother. This is 21st Century Ozzy. It's fresh, new, heavy and incorporates many modern elements. It's 2010, join us if you will.    On a sonic level, Scream is an absolute monster. It'll shatter glass with any halfway decent sound system. I've read some harsh words about Kevin Churko's sound. I don't quite get why exactly. He finds a way to bring every instrument front and center to kick your head in. Blasko (bass) and Tommy (drums) are loud and fierce as a rhythm section, particularly throughout 'Let It Die' and 'Diggin' Me Down.' I imagine it helps that they've worked together before but whatever the reason, they sound great together. Their fills and timing pulsate throughout the entire album. Additionally, it's nice to hear keyboards sprinkled throughout an Ozzy release again. They haven't been used this heavily in quite some time. Wakeman has a few really nice instrumental pieces and sets a mood in the background beautifully. Check out 'Crucify' and 'I Want It More' as great examples for that eerie vibe.    Gus G, although having no writing credits, completes the riff and solo department quite exceptionally. He has a more classical sound to his approach that creates a much more energetic, fast paced sound that had been missing from more recent Ozzy releases. 'I Want It More' 'Fearless' and 'Diggin Me Down' are fantastic examples. I think he fits well with Ozzy. He has moments that remind me of a few other Ozzy guitarists but still remains his own. It'll be interesting to see how they work together in the future. I'm very much looking forward to that.    Ozzy brings exactly what I expected. The vocals are heavily processed at times but they always have been for the most part and to be honest, it doesn't bother me a single bit. He has a knack for vocal melodies unlike anyone else. Some songs just click instantly and there were a few here I found stuck in my head after just one listen. He has an amazing ear for catchy, addictive vocal lines that weave in and out while remaining decidedly haunting and powerful. It's certainly no different here. His Beatles influences bleed through heavily on 'Life Wont Wait' and 'Time'    Let It Die: 12/10  Let Me Hear You Scream: 8/10  Soul Sucker: 8/10  Life Won't Wait: 10/10  Diggin' Me Down: 15/10  Crucify: 10/10  Fearless: 9/10  Time: 10/10  I Want It More: 9/10  Latimer's Mercy: 7/10  I Love You All: 8/10    I very highly recommend this to those willing to remain open minded about an Ozzy album that stands considerably well on its own after 40 years of recording. It is its own entity and should be treated as such. It's heavy, catchy and a really fun listen. It can't possibly be everyone's cup of tea but should be approached with humbled respect because it truly demands it. Once again, if you're longing for the resurrection of the Randy Rhoads era, don't waste your time. This is a different Ozzy, composed with a different producer, played by different band members in a very different time.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|I only have one question. What is Edge doing in this documentary? It's obvious from the start that Page and White are cut from the same cloth. Both are singular minded in their pursuit of blues based rock and pushing the boundaries as far as their imaginations can conceive. Both are great players and innovators. Edge?  Without his battery of effects and pedals couldn't play a blues riff if his life depended on it. It's clear throughout that Edge is the fifth wheel here and he's obviously out of place amongst these wizards of guitar and music. I've listened to U2 albums and I don't think I've ever heard anything that could be construed as a guitar solo or even a riff. Edge's playing is elementary though competent but nowhere near as innovative and captivating as either Page or White who stand in a class by themselves. By the end of this I felt sorry for ol' Mr. Evans because he was obviously out of his league here and had nothing to offer in comparison. Clearly U2 can write good pop songs but that's something that neither Page nor White could be bothered with. And frankly, neither can I. Here we have two greats with one wish-he-was. However, it's worth seeing for Pagey and Mr. White alone. Just fast forward through the Edge stuff unless you're into racks of special effects!

The coverage of the 250 named reactions, especially the background, explanations, and supporting literature is encyclopedic.  The presenation of the information is excellent, but suffers from a major problem.<br /><br />Unless you have access to a 32-bit machine DO NOT purchase this version.  MicroSoft offers a patch that Windows 7 (64-bit) users can download to enable software products written for XP and Vista to be run.  I've had mixed success with getting the patch to run these older software apps in the 64 bit environment.<br /><br />The bottom line is: Buy the paperback version at half the cost of this edition, or make friends with a Vista or XP machine owner.<br /><br />I checked with Amazona and Elsevier for warnings about this compatibility issue. Both companies admitted that none had been made public.  The IT help group at Elsevier were, of course, aware of the issue but offered no different solutions than downloading the MS patch.

0452284392|3.0|While the author of Linked is clearly an expert in the network theory space, this book is simply too dated to be of much interest to a reader except as a glimpse in time back to 2000.

I was interested in some of the historical anecdotes, but disappointed in the lack from fresh material.
0061353248|3.0|Prof Ariely of the MIT poses the question as to whether we make decisions in our lives by being in control and making rational, sensible choices. Then,through his research in the  book, he refutes our assumption about ourselves that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. He says that we make astonishingly simple but irrational decisions everyday and not only that, we keep repeating it again and again! The reason for such behavior, he says, is that we grossly underestimate the profound impact our emotions, expectations, social norms etc have on our decision making process.<br /><br />Each of the chapters in the book describes a force (emotion, relative evaluation, social norms, etc) that influences our behavior. The experiments point to how these influences exert substantial power over our behavior in decision making.<br /><br />One of the experiments I found interesting was the one on honesty which shows how we all would like to 'steal' in kind rather than cash. The  statistics that employee theft in offices amount to a staggering $600 billion a year is a case in point!<br />Another interesting experiment is on the impact of social norms and market norms in our lives and how conflict and confusion arise when they are mixed in a single event. Other interesting chapters are on procrastination and also how advance expectations affect our decisions.<br /><br />Some of the chapters are more ordinary such as the conclusions that sexual arousal affects our decision making and that people feel better taking a medicine that costs 10 times as much as another, identical, medicine and that we will think food or drink is better if it is presented in a more glamorous setting.<br /><br />Much has been said about Prof.Ariely's methodology, sample populations and conclusions as too sweeping and unscientific. I am not qualified enough to critically examine all of them. But the book is a delightful read and as one reads and reflects on it, it does make a lot of sense and one can relate to many of the experiments through one's own personal experience. The book certainly challenges accepted wisdom and provides enough experimental evidence to evaluate Dr.Ariely's conclusions. I found it an enjoyable read and would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject of 'the rational man'.rough one's own personal experience.

B00005QAPK|4.0|A trio of Poe stories presented on the screen with unique vision and flair by three respected European directors. The first, METZENGERSTEIN, by Roger Vadim, features a nubile, Barbarella-esque Jane Fonda as an imperious, mildly sadistic and hedonistic  young socialite/Contessa named Frederique, presumably in the Middle Ages. Her days are spent in corporeal delights and mockery of those unlike her. She is always surrounded by similar pleasure-seeking leeches, most lifeless in their monotonous revel. Fonda, director Vadim's wife at the time, shines in a terse but evocative  performance, perfect in her role, saying much with looks, attitude and posture.<br /><br />The Contessa's life is irrevocably altered when she meets a rogue cousin, a young Baron played by Fonda's real-life brother, Peter Fonda. He is bright and talented but has forsaken higher pursuits and certain adulation to remain where he is most happy and doing what makes him most happy---tending to his land and raising his beloved horses. She derides his folly but is fascinated at his certitude and conviction. When he rebuffs her advice to change she orders his stables set on fire. Unbeknownst to her, the Baron tries to save his horses but perishes. The Contessa is devastated. However, a wild  black horse that came running out of the fires, deemed incorrigible by townspeople trying to subdue it, strangely remains pacific for her. She becomes fixated on the animal and rides it for long periods of time. The powerful animal seems to provide the strength and direction probably missing from her life.  Sexual undertones abound as the domineering young woman is now able control the proud and prodigious beast---in stark contrast to her usually weak, addicted and lifeless male suitors. At first, it appears that the stallion is the deceased Baron returning in another form to somehow procure justice for his death. But soon it becomes more probable that the animal represents the Contessa's conscience, now severely shaken to the point of calm redirection, in search of justice for her tragic decision. The Contessa's intrinsic nature as an egotist, however, is unchanged and, thus, her solution for justice is self destruction as she cannot bear the thought of her miscue. There is much pathos here as the Baron was probably the only person the self-involved young woman ever genuinely admired. He had attained happiness, a state that had eluded her, yet she extinguished it with a decision driven by pompous audacity. Feeling like a cancer that eradicates the normal, she deems excision the only remedy. Splayed scantily-clad on her horse  in symbolic submission  to her conscience, to her necromancy, to the only man to impassion her, she replicates the same fate as her victim, riding the stallion into a burning forest---an almost masochistic last act.<br /><br />The music is haunting and melancholy throughout complementing both the bleak, gray, rocky coastline and the uninviting, dense forests, with the young woman's guilt and despair---as is the silence, allowing hoofs, wind, rocks, surf and even owls to speak, though sadly.<br /><br />The segment titled WILLIAM WILSON is directed by Louis Malle. It is my favorite of the three stories. It follows a young man [WILSON] as an adolescent in military school, through  medical school and then in the army.  Although of select upbringing, the handsome and popular Wilson is an angry and insecure youth---and a depraved sadist.  French actor Alain Delon plays Wilson scrumptiously well, his calm demeanor and boyish good looks belying his mental instability exquisitely. In military school he imperils the life of a class tattle-tale by lowering him into a barrel of ravished rodents. A new student---who bears his exact name---saves the snitch and exposes Wilson who is kicked out of the school. Years later, while in medical school, Wilson kidnaps a young woman and prepares to vivisect her in the anatomy lab in front of his colleagues. Again, a stranger who bears his name saves the young victim. Wilson's escapade, however, is made public and he is asked to abandon his career. Later, while in the army, Wilson challenges a haughty woman who derides him to a poker game, with Wilson acquiring his foe if he wins. He wins but by dishonest means. The woman, expecting a sexual  repayment, is instead brutally whipped and humiliated in public by Wilson. A stranger, another soldier with the same name, exposes Wilson's cheating. Wilson  is repudiated and kicked out of the army. An angered and paranoid Wilson now challenges the man who has circumvented each of his sociopathic follies and has destroyed his career. Wilson kills his tormentor in a fencing match. The weight of his deed is too much to bear, however, and the crazed Wilson ends his life by jumping off a cathedral. As witnesses arrive, Wilson's supine, lifeless  body has no impact injury but rather bears the marks and wound of his victim. The 'other' William Wilson was that part of him that mental dissolution would not allow him to recognize and incorporate---all that was good in him, his alter ego personified.  The good and the bad in each of us is like a solution containing, and defined by, two disparate substances that are mixed together: without either component the solution does not exist. By murdering his counterpart William Wilson killed himself.<br /><br />TOBY DAMMIT is Federico Fellini's contribution. This one is about a popular British actor, well past his peak, who is invited to Rome, Italy, to participate in a production. However, unbeknownst to the celluloid entourage who receive him, the substance-abusing Brit is in the midst of spiraling toward insanity---and perdition. Vet Terrance Stamp is marvelous as the pallid and pasty, anhedonic, spiritless Brit.  Instead of receiving care and rehabilitation in the form of reaffirmation and rediscovery [of his innate talents and noble achievements] from his Italian colleagues, the latter suck the last bit of life out of him. Fellini here presents a mesmerizing stageshow of specious  emcees, models, executives, newspeople, paparazzi, hangers-on and the like, all parasitizing their victim for their own end. Behind the smiles  of VIP's is derision and cynicism. Behind the muted, doll-like countenance of each model is a lifelessness and a perverse pomposity---as if in their silence and tacit success they lay waiting for his inevitable disintegration. The emcees lie to the camera presenting the former Toby Dammit and not the mess he is now. Toby is objectified---just a step in others' ascent to prosperity---and no one cares.<br /><br />The only time he responds with certitude is when asked by newspeople if he has ever seen the devil. Indeed, Toby is followed by a little girl with a ball who he believes is the devil. She is pleasant, smiles and  playfully bounces her ball---definite non-satanic  behavior. But whether real or a substance-driven hallucination, she does not hurt him like those around him have. In fact, during the stageshow, in the throes of spiraling despair, a young well-dressed woman sits next to him and informs him that he will be fine, that she will always take care of him. She was probably the transformed little girl. Again, either a defense mechanism for survival or the actual devil himself.<br /><br />Toby finally has had his fill of the manipulation and pain and decides to ride off the set. He drives a sports car to the rustic outskirts of Rome away from the lights and scrutiny. Brilliant filmmaking here as his nocturnal high-speed sojourn takes him through areas that are active and populated during the day but that are disturbingly desolate and foreign at night. Nothing out there but gazing store mannequins, closed doors and windows, sleeping walls, aimless and stagnant drunks. His sports car, probably symbolic of the snowballing of his psychosis, encounters claustrophobic and frustrating  blind alleys, narrow winding roads, barricades and detours. He might as well have been on another planet. His condition is exacerbated by the futility of his drive and the abrupt absence of people and feedback. He is now desperate to get back to the city but can't seem to find a way back.  He reaches  a closed off break in the road where a bridge came down. On the other side he sees the little girl with her ball. He decides to high-speed it across but is decapitated by something he does NOT see. Fellini extended that fear we all occasionally get when a place we may or may not be familiar with becomes alienized in our minds because of hurry, mental disorder or lack of sensory input [i.e. light and sound] from our environment. A discordant, pretentious Bava-like ending but all is forgiven as the ride to this destination Fellini provides is quite an insightful and informative trip.<br /><br />These three Poe stories were surreal depictions of the austerity of the human condition and its guises. All are journeys into oblivion as each lead character ends his/her life---not the type of film you would show at a support-group meeting. Like all of us, each character was a plastic and inquisitive child of the universe, replete with pride and inordinate potential, BUT each was misguided to a road that led to nowhere. Indeed, of tenuous and conflicted nurture and surrounded by depleting sycophants and users, the life of each was devoid of the heroes, the actuators, who could help them deter tragedy. Hopefully, you will still remember the guilt and transformation of Frederique, the irascibility and impulsivity of William Wilson, the helpless despair and descent of Toby years after watching this film, as I have.<br /><br />Caution: Remember, this DVD is presented in French. The English subtitles appear in a slightly awkward font. DVD quality is excellent, however. Still waiting for the English-dubbed version that we all saw back in the 80's. Maybe the folks at Criterion can help.of him.

B002RUA524|4.0|I read this book years and years ago in some public library in some small town far far away. I could vividly remember some scenes but couldn't for the life of me remember the text's title. I rediscovered it thanks to a \\"hilarious books\\" thread at a forum I'm a part of, and am so glad to have finally found it!    This book should be required reading for every little kid who loves animals -- and what kid doesn't? The narrator moves to a (beautifully described) villa in Greece and lives an idyllic existence there, collecting a real menagerie of pets as he does so -- and his adventures obtaining/living with those pets are as funny as they are charming. His interactions with his family members are just as hilarious (I love in particular his prissy older sister, and his perpetually sniffling mother).    Re-reading this as an adult, I have come to appreciate the author's skill as a writer -- this book made me want to visit Greece and find my own little cove with hot pebbles for a beach and a brilliantly blue sea. Sigh. Also, I want a praying mantis.     This book is going on my \\"Dearly Beloved\\" collection in my Kindle.

I was fortunate enough to see Joe live in Monterey, California in 2008 and then in London at Hammersmith Apollo on May 28, 2010, and this DVD makes me re-live that London concert and how my spouse and I felt!  He's brilliant!  He so good that he makes me want to weep!  I can't find the words to express what a fabulous guitarist and vocalist he is!!!!  This DVD makes you feel like you're standing right by him!
0618001905|5.0|King Leopold's Ghost provides a fascinating story of the Congo under the colonial rule of Leopold during the scramble for Africa.  It is a book that covers the terror and greed inflicted by the monarch versus the efforts of several different people who worked through religion, popular press, politics and business to bring reforms to the Congo. While these reforms were motivated by different reasons they were about the stopping of essentially slave labor that was harvesting rubber and building public works projects throughout the Congo.  While simplified into good and evil the author makes several valid arguments and tells a story that is often overlooked in most history books.  The book is very well written, tells great anecdotal stories along with supplemental historical documents to weave together a rich text that highlights the fall of Leopold's Congo and the slave workers that practiced there.  Overall you cannot get a more interesting read on this part of history and easily one of the best books written on colonial Africa. Whether you are an expert in the area or just starting out you cannot go wrong with this one.
0802130208|3.0|I enjoyed some of this book's humor but after working in the social service field all my life what some may find funny I found tiring and based more on reality than some might believe. There are hundreds of men out there who fit the the main character's profile who have frustrated more than one well intentioned caseworker not to mention the \\"dunces\\" families. There is comic genius to this novel but how much is creative writing is at issue. Nick Hornby's a \\"Long Way Down\\" made me laugh a lot more and had much more to say!! It's sad the author died but I sense his genius was overblown by critics based on the circumstances of his untimely demise.
B003SWU9R6|4.0|After the travesty of the album that was Relapse, Recovery is a fresh breeze from Eminem. As a fan from his first album, Relapse was the self-destruct album. Worst money I ever spent. This album feels like a recovery from begining to end with raw emotion and great lyrics. I've been listening to it since yesterday and can't believe the difference.    My faves so far:   Going Through Changes  Love the Way You Lie  Talkin to Myself  Cinderella Man  Space Bound    Keep it coming Eminem. This album is what it says it is, and hopefully it can bring the rap industry back with it.
B003KUSUG8|1.0|After admitting to two duds  (Encore & Relapse ) Eminem has returned with promises of quality music and less gimmicky antics. Some how Eminem manages to keep half of his promise by toning down the comedic aspect of the music, but fails to deliver the \\"quality\\" part fans expected.    Recovery starts off sounding pretty good. Fortunately, you won't find any cornball skits or random sound effects, just music.  As soon I heard the \\"Dum-Da-Na-Na-Dum-Dum-Da-Dum\\" chant on the opening track [Cold Wind Blows] I knew it was about to be on and I was sure this would be an amazing album, but boy was I wrong.    I don't even find it necessary to go into an in-depth analysis of the rest of this because to me, it's just bad. (Meaning it's so bad it wouldn't make sense going \\"this song sucks and this sucks too, and this one etc) Recovery is plagued with bad production, an absurd amount of singing (which is generally awful) and repeditive lyrics. It seemed like he spend the whole album crying or apologizing to the fans but not really talking about anything. Do you remember when Eminem used to come up with creative concepts like \\"Stan\\"? Too much thought is going into his delivery and not enough time is being spent on the conceptional aspect of being an emcee. \\"White Trash Party\\"? Come on man, you can come up with something better than that...Or maybe you can't?    I honestly believe Eminem's time is up when it comes to rapping. He's getting older, and I think the angsty sort of thing he was pitching to white teens in the suburbs has sort of run it's course. After 3 terrible albums in a row it's clear theres nothing left to say. So in Em's own words, \\"Put the mic down and walk away, you could still have a little bit of dignity\\" Iumak gives this album a 2/10     (Note: Best hiphop album of the year so far: Nas and Damian Marley's album, \\"Distant Relatives\\" I would suggest picking it up before getting Eminem or Drake's albums)
0439023483|4.0|Like many reviewers, it did not take me long to finish this book.  Cliffhangers galore basically prevent you from closing it until it's finished.<br /><br />For the most part, I liked it.  Especially in the beginning, I thought the writing was very solid, the descriptions apt, the characters intriguing.  But then...right when they arrived at the Capitol, I felt as if things got a bit off-track.  Supporting characters were very one-dimensional, the high-quality description was basically discarded in favor of explaining the clich&eacute; futuristic gadgets and gizmos that I've read one too many times.  Who cares about the shower having confusing buttons?  Or wardrobe?  I mean, yes, clothing is interesting, it tells more about the character, and I thought the whole flame costume was pretty cool, but I could have done with one less \\"oh, I barely recognize myself\\" scene that resulted every time she put on a dress.  It got old.<br /><br />[SPOILERS]<br />Now, the Game itself.  I thought it was well-paced, and had the appropriate amount of violence and obstacles.  There were several times I thought Katniss got off too easily--Rue and Thresh are killed for her, and there's a miraculous \\"rule\\" that she can now work with Peeta--pita bread, get it? ha. ha.--without having to kill him.  Yay her.  That whole announcement just annoyed me when I read it--far too convenient.  In my opinion, it just cheapened anything they did together afterward.  Instead of helping him in spite of the rules, she helps him because she's allowed--and encouraged--to do so.  Teamwork at its finest.<br /><br />On a whole, I feel that this book was an enjoyable read.  It was entertaining, despite my few annoyances with it, and is set up for the following books in the series, which I will be picking up.
B001GCUO5W|3.0|I saw this film in the theatre and Leonardo's character is pretty creepy to say the least. But I found the story a bit predictable-I had a feeling towards the film's end who the real bad guy was-and I was right. Nice try Scorsese, but no cigar.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Recovery is an amazing rap album.  Period.  The title of the album is definitely symbolic of Eminem's recovery to his 2000-2002 form when he released Marshall Mathers LP and the Eminem Show.<br /><br />The album does two things very well.  The first, is the rapid-fire lyrical rapping that made Eminem famous.  The second, is the emotional, empathetic, and emotional lyrics that shows how Eminem has matured.<br /><br />Throughout the album, tracks such as \\"Not Afraid,\\" \\"Talkin'2 Myself,\\" \\"On Fire,\\" \\"Space Bound,\\" and several other tracks capture the ruthless lyrical aggression found in the Marshall Mathers LP.  For most of the album you can can't help but wonder when Eminem catches his breath as he spits out rapid fire lyrics, for example in \\"Talkin'2 Myself,\\" Eminem spits the following in under 20 seconds.<br /><br />...I went away I guess to open up some lanes<br />But there was no one who even knew what I was going through<br />Hatred was flowing through my veins<br />On the verge of going insane<br />I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne<br />It's like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin'<br />I felt horrible about myself<br />He was spittin and I wasn't<br />Anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it<br />Almost went at Kanye too<br />God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic...<br /><br />While at other times, Eminem maintains his lyrical genius while also rapping about feelings and emotions that we've all had, like in \\"Space Bound.\\"<br /><br />Cuz I been treated like dirt before ya<br />And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya<br />Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone<br />It's no one's fault but my own. it's the path I've chosen to go<br /><br />A major difference from Recovery is the use of more \\"rock\\" toned beats, which allows Eminem to maintain his aggressive lyrics and flow. Yet, still most of the album feels like a classic Eminem album.  If this album were to be released after the Eminem Show or in between Marshall Mathers LP and the Eminem Show, many critics and fans would probably not be too blow away.  It would still receive positive praise for the witty lyrics that are both empathetic and emotional, but would not be a big diversion of his typical sound.  Which, at times is relaxing and great for rap fans because its been far too long since we've heard Eminem's sound, but can be boring to a non-fan or casual rap listener because Em's lyrics and sound hasn't changed much or revolutionized rap and pop like \\"My Name is...,\\" \\"Without Me,\\" or \\"Stan\\" did for the industry.<br /><br />But, on a positive note if songs such as \\"Cinderlla Man,\\" \\"25 to Life,\\" and \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" with Rihanna are any indicators of whats to come, Eminem is still well on his way to once again providing a new revolutionary and groundbreaking music that launched his career.<br /><br />Everyone should pick up Recovery to be reminded about how brilliant and amazing Eminem was, but on the same note, if this was an ode to the past, I can't wait for Eminem's next album and see what he'll come out with next.<br /><br />Now that Eminem has recovered, I can't wait to see what his Revolution will look like.
B000J10EQU|4.0|This is not the Christopher Reeve version Superman that we know and love, but it comes pretty damn close. What i liked most about this version of Superman is the deeper relationship between Lois Lane and Superman and how real it is. To me, the STORY should be just as important as the \\"cool\\" graphics, and Singer nails it here. Lois Lane is Superman's love of his life, as well as Lois'...the two are inseparable. Despite having been gone and Lois moving on to another man, the love definitely is still there. Then of course, there is the ongoing battle between Lex Luthor and Superman, so it's like having two great stories in one movie! There is emotional chemistry in this film that is undeniable. You can actually feel what superman is going through throughout the film, both the good and the bad.  I must have seen this movie 5 times since its release...I give Director/screenwriter Bryan Singer a hefty two thumbs up for an engaging, emotional, well-written story.
B002SF9YNO|4.0|I rented \\"Departures\\" because it won the Oscar recently for Best Foreign-Language Film.  There's always a lot of great competition in that category.  I found \\"Departures\\" to be very engrossing although there were a couple of moments that I was a bit uncertain about where we were going next.  The essential plot is that of a gifted (but not THAT gifted) cellist who loses his job (along with the rest of the orchestra).  He returns to his relatively small home town and finds a job.  It's an unusual job and understanding the job takes up a fair amount of the film.  Some people belittle or otherwise criticize the job.  (I know my wife probably would have given me a choice of her or the job).      The cast of characters begins to come together in a most unique manner and reaches a conclusion that achieves an emotional peak.  I was emotionally spent as a result of the last few minutes of the film.  As I was watching the ending unfold, I remembered that it was Father's Day.  In fact, my two daughters had each called during the movie at which times I gratefully put the DVD on pause until our conversations were completed.  I realized that I had been given one of the greatest cinematic glimpses of a father's love (no matter how incomplete the example may have been) that I have experienced on film.  (Our own family movies aside, of course).      The film, overall, has its' ups and downs and I was disappointed that the director felt he (or she?) had to repeat an earlier scene to make sure we got the message.  I recalled the earlier scene quite clearly when the time came to put it all together and I felt that repeating it was an example of a director not respecting his (or her?) audience.  Nonetheless, love takes many forms in expressing itself and \\"Departures\\" contribution to this kaleidoscope was brilliant and unforgettable.  I'm glad I picked just the right day to watch \\"Departures\\".
B0019N8P2W|3.0|Having watched the original series and then the reruns on Nick (who's idea was it to sell out doing that really?) I am an avid fan of the series.  It's a major let down that the original sound track is edited clean out seeing as how there are several scenes where the artist and/or song itself is referenced in the show and suddenly you're left feeling bewildered.  I got to see several scenes that were edited out in the Nickelodeon reruns which brought back plenty of fond memories but I noticed that in a few sections there were actually lines missing, a few cutting one liners that are skipped out and if I can catch them I'm sure that there are far more die hard fans than I who spotted them too.  Among, to me, the most important missing parts to the series was \\"Look Back in Annoyance\\" where Daria and Jane look back on the series with all the running gags, one liners, and best of moments.  They threw in some nice extras and the \\"cast interviews section was only six minutes, a true homage to MTV's truncated style.<br /><br />The fact that Garbage's \\"Breaking Up the Girl\\" was missing from the final movie was nearly heartbreaking since that movie premiered the same night as the music video and they were used to set each other up, as explained in \\"Look Back in Annoyance.\\"  Though not world shattering it is still a let down to not have some of the most relevant pieces in the set.  I wouldn't listen to half of the bands that I do now if not for having watched Daria like Garbage, Foo Fighters, etc.  Aside from most of these bands having fallen by the wayside I would think that they would have honestly appreciated the revival of their art and general reminiscent of their reign as stars.  Daria loses a lot in the translation without the music to break up /back up her general disposition and her theme, though memorable, is overplayed when you hit more than five times in a single episode.  Hell give that girl band another chance at the big time and let them write something relevant or get some garage bands a chance to write mood appropriate music and get their names out there.  People will do a lot more for free or less these days just to get a 30 second demo clip of their music played.  Ah well, I still like it and I'll keep it and watch it on occasion, just not in mini marathons like I would have been prone to otherwise.t or get some garage bands a chance to write mood appropriate music and get their names out there.

B0036B8MXC|4.0|I recall watching the first episode of \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" and literally laughing at the clumsy audacity of it. The show opened with a disclaimer ensuring us that all of the violence and \\"extreme sensuality\\" to follow was only so that they could portray a historically accurate Roman society. Sure. Right. No way can you have a true-to-life portrayal without every character screaming words we only refer to by their first initial in every sentence and every slave in the background being a gorgeous naked woman. And did you know that all the blood in gladiator matches was CG back then? Gotta love that historical authenticity. So only from a comedic standpoint did the show's pilot impress me. But hey, I like cursing and nude ladies and brutal violence as much as the next guy so I figured I'd keep on watching in spite of the moronic presentation and the obvious attempt to cash in on the popularity of the film \\"300\\" and it's uniquely-stylized version of sword-and-sandals history. Then a funny thing happened. The show got good. Real good. The second half of Spartacus was among the most compelling and unrelentingly bleak runs of television I've ever watched. It was almost HBO quality. And so it came to pass that Spartacus fought it's way into my heart and earned its place alongside Sci-Fi's Caprica as a show I could not wait to get home from work and watch. No other new show earned that kind of cred this year.<br /><br />So we all know the story of the slave revolt led by the title character by now.  Stanley Kubrick's classic epic saw to that. What's left to tell? Is this a remake? Well, first and foremost, the 300 style does this show some good in spite of it's contrived nature. Shots of the blood flying or blotting out the entire background as the character makes a kill and slows to a stop are pretty damn cool. The violence is plentiful and brutal as can be. The sex and nudity lets up some after the initial trying-too-hard phase, but stays present enough to keep viewers who are primarily impressed by such things interested, and the cursing becomes less comedically overdone. The blood and T&A cease to be the main draw of the series fairly early, actually. What makes Spartacus tick is not the simplistic tale of a betrayed soldier-turned-slave-turned-gladiator-turned-revolutionary; it's the fact that the show focuses not on the slave but on the master. The villains are developed enough with their own motives that you almost begin to root for them. John Hannah as Batiatus and Lucy Lawless as his wife, Lucretia, are marvelous to watch. Batiatus's mad ravings and ambitious schemes to ride Spartacus' success in the arena to political power drive the plot to great heights of tragedy and betrayal while Lucretia's sexual intrigue shows that women too held an element of power in Roman society. The supporting cast is even stronger. Many of the various slaves and gladiators have backstories and motives of their own that make the tapestry of the plot increasingly complex and intriguing as the story moves on. Many of them will meet with bad ends, and you will likely feel each loss. There really are no good or bad characters here. Every one is a bastard of one kind or another. But they are all enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br /> The best thing I can really say about the show is that is almost constantly surprised me once it got rolling. I quite literally never knew what was going to happen next in spite of my familiarity with the classic tale. The choice to tear the story as we knew it down and rebuild it around a completely different framework was risky and bold, and it paid off. The Roman high society aspect turned out to produce some really incredible drama and plot twists to keep the story fresh while still feeding us all of the primal machismo of gladatorial combat and brotherhood. I'm really glad this is coming back for a second season. The first season ends with a massive bang that quite literally rips asunder everything that had been built over the first 12 hours. I kind of love that. If nothing else, Spartacus is a show that revels in taking bold risks. Gotta respect it. It's also worth pointing out that Sam Raimi has a producing credit. Didn't think he had it in him since light-hearted fantasy seems to be more his taste in television, but add another notch to his cool column.<br /><br />Okay, so you like seeing the unclothed body parts of well-endowed males and/or females. You like limbs getting hacked off and people beaten to death. You want lots of intrigue and plot twists and romantic longing juxtaposed with sexual conquest. You want a hero who is both unconquerable and routinely humbled. You like to make gay gladiator jokes and hear a supposed proper gentleman's exclamations regarding Roman deity's genitalia.  Well, you've come to the right place, my friend. And not only that, but even if these things are more of a take-it-or-leave-it kind of deal for you, Spartacus: Blood and Sand may still end up being a show you can't take your eyes off of if you give it a chance. It may not be an authentic representation of ancient Roman culture, but it is a compelling trip into a stylized version of it that pays a lot of dividends and is not afraid to hurt the audience's feelings or slit a major character's throat for it's own amusement or just to make the revenge that much sweeter in the end. And that willingness to constantly change the landscape of the show even after building upon that landscape is what makes it such a joy to watch in the end, all superficial crassness aside.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for my Nephew(he really liked it)! Great product & service! Thanks!
B000EQHHJW|5.0|Rigoletto was never my favourite opera as far as the plot is concerned but I was really impressed with this production. What a fine blend of music and drama! I normally prefer staged performance to the film version but this film is fantastic. Pavarotti as a duke is superb. He fits the role perfectly and does he act here! Yes, Pavarotti actually can act. Everyone here is great. Ingvar Wixell sings and acts a very believable Rigoletto.     Edita Gruberova, perhaps, is not the best Gilda in the world but her performance is rock solid, nothing to complain about. A portrait a bit too stereotypical, perhaps? Her signing is great though. Furlanetto as Sparafucile on the other hand is another surprise: picturesque, perhaps too much over the top with his dramatic make-up. After all he is supposed to be an assassin and not a street bum. But dramatically and visually very effective and striking.    Even the small roles are performed superbly, notably Marullo, who took two characters to create (an actor and a singer). He steals every scene he appears in. Another interesting character here is Giovanna who is played by legendary Fedora Barbieri, a true master of the art.  What she does with such a small and insignificant role of Giovanna has to be seen. She is a pure delight to watch.     Also notice that Wixell plays both Rigoletto and Monterone. It just adds a nice touch to the whole action. Wonderful.     The locations are picturesque but at the same time operatic and don't really detract from the action.      The very first scene (the feast at the Duke's court) is mind-blowing. Ponnelle took the full advantage of the film possibilities as opposed to stage production and as a result we have absolutely amazing dramatic experience of this famous opera.    Some moments are overdone or just plain ludicrous, like Rigoletto hanging on the balcony. But they are rare and don't detract much from the great overall impression.     I love it. If you want to own just one version, this would be my choice. That is, besides the one with Tito Gobbi whose Rigoletto is a class in himself.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This album definitely has a different feel to it than Relapse.  I liked Relapse a lot, even with the aggressive attitude and sometimes over the top lyrics, and Recovery follows it's own title.  The songs on this album are more about just being quality music with classic Eminem lyrical game.  There are a couple songs that I don't like(Won't Back Down with Pink, Cinderella Man), but overall this is a new fresh attitude Eminem that makes for a great album. Relapse and Recovery are both 4.5 stars and appropriately titled.
B003REEPJS|5.0|Really love this over her older music, because in my opinion it shows the growth in her voice. That she has more control and power behind her voice now. This album also shows that she do various different types of songs, their not all the same. So you get blend of different music. Can't wait to see what she does in the future. This also shows that shes different from Hannah Montana, so she won't be stuck as Hannah Montana for rest of her singing career.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I will never regret buying this epic movie! The graphics are insane and the story line just tells you what kind of company Square Enix is: An excellent company that spends several years creating intensely epic story lines that will not falter in years to come!
B001APM46W|2.0|Though Mr. Michael still has the pipes, somehow this album fails to click with me.  It is not specifically bad, just not inspiringly good; and somehow I expect more from him than this, since the talent is there.  I have had the album for a couple of months now, and I find I have listened to it only three times...definitely not worth the money I paid for it.  Disappointing.
0307463745|4.0|I read this book in one sitting (despite its thickness, the book contains fairly large font and many illustrations).  It reads very fast but there is a lot packed in, so you'll likely want to re-read it.  I've also read parts of \\"Getting Real\\" (their first book). Both books are great and fairly similar in terms of philosophy, but would opt for \\"Rework\\" over \\"Getting Real,\\" because \\"Rework\\" is more accessible and relevant to the non-programming audience.  Other reviewers have commented that a lot of material is available on 37signals' Signals v. Noise blog.  Somewhat true, but I found their messages and suggestions resonated much stronger in the compact and unified book form.  The blog, while great, touches on many different topics (quite a few specific to the programming crowd) and tends to explore different paths.  Highly recommended!
B003FMTZOM|4.0|This album has been a long time in waiting. I must  say upon initial  listen  I was only half impressed with it. I was  expecting some overly catchy hooks and something that was  full force  on like a whole album of  songs like \\"Not Myself Tonight\\". (Which i am glad it wasn't actually)     When I first heard the single it took some adjusting to  for sure. I have never heard her   like this before. It was heavy on the synthesizers and effects. These are typically reserved for her popstar counter parts. I felt  that the first  half was  a strong  experience  and then it just sort of tapered off to  a stand still.      Well after a few listens. I must say there are solid tracks here. There are some that might even stand the test of time. The album starts off with Bionic. This song pulled me in instantly. Especially on my favorite part where she  says \\" ready to go\\". Here is a slick  Timbaland-like feel to with it  with a little JT put in for  good measure. It was different not having her  belt it out all the time. That was the biggest adjustment like most songs on this album. Next comes the single which I now skip due to it being played out  already. I did enjoy  \\"Whoohoo\\" feat. Nicki.I  was also surprised to  learn that  the whole chorus is  done by aguilera herslef. She sort of raps and  flows on  this one. She works it out  quite  well.    I enjoyed Glam which is a modern take on Madonna's  \\"Vogue\\" in my opinion.Once again christina holds back (vocally)  for most of that song and that takes some getting used to.  Primadonna is  nice number but i think it could have benefited from  some additonal voices on the chorus.  I also  kept  expecting a rap to come on but it never does. Even though you hear voices of the ying yang  twins or lil 'jon distinctly even though they  never  spit any ryhmes. Maybe it's an illusion?    I surprisingly  enjoyed \\"Elastic Love\\" more than I thought I would. Even though it  is hard to  actually hear Christina on this track because her voice is put through so many effects that  she is unrecognizable.    The ballads all work on this album. My favorite  being \\"You  Lost Me\\" this one screams single potential all over it. I also enjoyed \\"I Am\\" where for part of the song she sounds like something out of a old movie.It works well here.    I surprisingly also  enjoyed \\"my  girls\\" and \\"i hate boys\\" (even though i am one myself).    I felt the song Vanity was a little much  especially on the part at the end about \\"who owns the throne?\\" and then her child answers she  does. I know it was probably meant as a  joke but it comes off like she is kind of full of herself.     The album version I got didn't have any bonus songs ,but from what I have heard from other reviews they are something worth listening to as well.      I think if you are used to hearing Christina  a certain way you may be disappointed intially but  give it a few listens you will be surprised at what you like. I give it album 4 stars out of  5.
0061245097|5.0|One Foot in the Grave is the brilliant sequel to Halfway to the Grave. In this novel Cat is reunited with the sexy and unresistable Bones. Cat has tried her best to live after leaving Bones, but it was nothing compared to having him back again, and he must feel the same because he is sure as hell not going to let her go this time. This series is one of my favorites and if you liked the first Night Huntress novel, you'll adore this one. It's worth every penny, even the shipping charge.

B002RVZV9K|3.0|I will have to disagree with the last four-star reviewer who's review was titled \\"Two Greats and One.....???\\"  He seems to think that Jack White is in the same iconic league as Jimmy Page.  What in God's name could he be thinking?  Jack White is a hack when it comes to playing guitar. So what? He can use a slide bar, big freakin' deal.  He sings like a girl and plays like a ninny.  I'm not even a blues-type guitarist; I'm a metal/folk guitarist/mandolinist, and I could out blues-riff and out blues-lick Jack White any day of the week.  After teaching him a thing or two about guitar-playing, I would have to rip that ridiculous hat off of his head and throw it in the rubbish with his \\"plastic\\" guitar and his \\"plastic\\" guitar playing as well. It's clearly evident that the only reason he is in the music business is because he just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Not only does he not belong in the same room as Jimmy Page, but he would have run home like a sissy girl if he had ever gone up against the likes of blues guitar players like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, Dickey Betts, and Billy Gibbons.<br /><br />The Edge admitted in the movie that he simplifies everything.  When he was showing his \\"adjusted\\" Major E chord, it was clear that he had removed the G# and the lower B (5th string 2nd fret).  The resulting chord sounded like all the other garbage that U2 has put out...tinny, sustained without body, and monotonous. I agree with \\"Two Greats and One.....???\\" in that I don't think I have ever heard him perform an awesome solo in any song he has ever done...and that's even within the safety net of recording in a studio.  It's all real banausic, straightforward, single-note, boring nonsense, and, by the way, \\"The\\" is a STUPID name. However, one aside about The Edge that puts him above Jack White--at least he has some humility when in the presence of a guitar master like Page. At least he seems to have some personality and it's clear that the music business fame hasn't gone to his head like the dork with the goofy hat, Mr. No Riff.<br /><br />As far as the film itself, it's as flawed as a...well, as a flaw! There wasn't ANYONE to interview these guys, and they were left holding the \\"interview mic\\" themselves and certainly didn't do a very good job of it. What was the whole sequence about the child actor acting like a little Jack White about? That didn't fit into the scheme of things at all! And worst of all, what in the name of all that is holy were they linking Jimmy Page to a Fender Stratocaster for anyway? Sure, it may have been his first guitar, but they should have brought to light the acquisition of his first Gibson Les Paul instead. There was a reason Jimmy didn't keep playing Strats and moved to Les Pauls, and they missed it here.  One last question...Why, \\"The Weight?\\"  Why would they pick a mid- to sub-standard song that relied more upon the lyrics and their presentation than the melody when doing a video about the guitar? Shouldn't the producers have picked a more blues guitar-based song for the three to perform together as a grand finale? How about something like Led Zeppelin's \\"You Shook Me\\" or \\"The Lemon Song\\" or even \\"I Cant' Quit You, Babe?\\" You know, \\"All Right Now\\" by Free would have been better than \\"The Weight.\\" The production team just wasn't firing on all cylinders here.<br /><br />Four stars for a very limited amount of Jimmy Page footage, minus one star for Jack \\"No Riff\\" White, and minus one-half star for The.

Phil Collins is at his greatest on this album. Stand out songs are \\"Squonk\\", \\"Los Endos\\", and one of my favorite songs by Genesis is \\"Ripples\\" which is on this cd as well.<br /><br /> Buy this version of the cd.
0307269981|5.0|Fun read.  I don't understand the reviewers who say the plot is slow.  Of the 3 books this is by far the quickest mover.  Fun, exciting and perfect for a summer read.  Both my sisters are enjoying the books now.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|I'd say Ozzy pulled the right strings with Scream.  Gus is a pretty impressive guitar player and the guitar tones stand out.  With Zakk no longer doing the guitar work, it actually helps the album although I love Zakk's work.  The last few albums sounded like Black Label Society featuring Ozzy Osbourne...not a bad thing but not exactly a good thing either.  No, this album is not Blizzard of Ozz or any of Ozzy's classics from the '80s.  It's a modern Ozzy album; it is 2010, after all.  I gave it four stars, but more like 4.5 stars.  Like I said earlier, the guitar tones really help out this effort.  It just sounds fresher and definitely heavier.  While I love Scream, I fear it may be a little too heavy for some Ozzy fans.  Just open your mind and definitely enjoy this album.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|It is one of those sequels that are as good or even better than the original. My kids are 3 and 18 months and they watch the whole movie without blinking. They love the characters and the story. We watch it with pleasure every time.
B002GHHJU4|4.0|No matter how you feel about the movie (people usually have extreme views in either direction about it) this is actually a pretty cool soundtrack. I'd totally recommend it.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|The best cd Rhianna has put out. Well worth every cent spent. It's even better than her newest cd, Rated R.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|I would gladly pay to listen to Ozzy read the phonebook. The man is my religion, my hero, my love. There is no such thing as a bad Ozzy album. Scream is a bit of a disappointment, though. There are a few good songs: \\"Let it Die,\\" \\"Diggin' Me Down,\\" and \\"Soul Sucker\\" stand out for me after about five listens. The album was originally going to be called \\"Soul Sucker.\\" Thankfully they changed that. \\"Scream\\" isn't a much better title, though. If you had to go with one of the song titles for the album title, then \\"Crucify\\" would have been a good choice. Of past albums, this one is most like \\"Down to Earth\\"--with some good parts and good music but lacking in any really killer songs. I was never a huge Zakk fan, but Gus G. fails to impress on this album. I'd love to hear Ozzy work with Rick Rubin as producer next time. Rick can do for Ozzy what he did for Johnny Cash and Metallica--deliver the ultimate comeback album when a career appears to be over.    Update: OK, I'm adding this update now after about twenty listens. The album has really grown on me. I'd now give it 4.5 stars. Gus G. helped make a new Ozzy album. That's what this is: a new Ozzy album, and the key element is Ozzy. He certainly doesn't need Zakk or anyone else in particular. Some day Ozzy will get his much-deserved props as a songwriter.
B002RAREAK|4.0|One of Usher's best cd yet. The next Michael Jackson? He's just about there with this cd. Gr8 tracks.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Sadly this is Hollywood these days, bad movies galore. I would like the two hours of my life back and the fuel I wasted driving to the library to get rent this afterbirth of a movie. This is clearly not a Trek film, I've seen pornos with better character development and plot. This movie just sucks compared to the rest of Star Trek.    Now to see how bad Spielberg ruins \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", not looking forward to that day.
B002QB1910|4.0|An all-around good CD. Not as good as her Good Girls Gone Bad CD, but still worth the purchase.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Wow, fishing out gold teeth, plenty historically accurate uses of the flamethrower but maybe a little overdone for some shock value, and all the other \\"shocks\\" that a modern American audience might be astonished by, who don't generally read history books, or any books like Americans used to, or even being taught anything other than politically corrected history through incorrect junk education in the schools without real history other than \\"the american civil war was a war started to end slavery\\" or \\"america is a place to work and all the worlds citizens have american rights\\", etc etc etc, or due to t.v./internet chat rooms/adolescent video games/cell phone entertainment, so what was lacking was the real historical other side accounts of Americans getting nasty nasties done to them in the course of war, like surrendered Americans tortured and killed in the usual manner, or found dead with bamboo through them when roped over pointy sharp/slant cut down bamboo that can grow a foot a day or more in the pacific, or hacked apart a limb at a time, I mean, you get the picture of \\"take no prisoners unless there was a massive work to death project to be done\\", there were plenty worse on the other side, including cannabalism of prisoners since the Japanese were quite often cut off from supplies and starving(Quadalcanal especially) and let me mention the burma railroad immortalized in \\"Bridge over the River Quai\\" which is the \\"G\\" rated version of what happened there.   This kind of reminds me of what one of my neighbor women said about a stray ferrel cat that was attacking and ripping apart all the neighbors's kittens and house cats and scratched up several neighbors including myself when we tried to catch it to take it to the pound, when the animal control officer came around and rounded it up with a loop and dropped it in a cage to be taken away, she cried \\"Oh, that poor kitty\\", ha, yeah right, poor wild unfeeling ripper indeed, oh, like the way \\"poor\\" WW2 Japanese ImperialArmy soldiers are portrayed in this show alot of times.    Other than that, the old liberal ploy of portraying every soldier as permanently mentally \\"damaged\\" by military service, all military service from peacetime to wartime/paperpusher to greasemonkey or grunt, if you're a veteran like myself especially of a war then you are supposedly somebody folks need to maybe steer clear of in their so many words, so they/we can be eliminated as a credible voting block as is popular in modern times on t.v./movies/news reprorts was apparent in the nuthouse scene, I mean, very nicely done, I am surprised they didn't throw in some of the usual stuff like \\"guns are bad and should be banned, etc etc nonsense\\" or have a Bush Sr. charactor(who actually is a ww2 vet) receiving a straightjacket, I mean, it is surprising Lecke wasn't saying \\"here Bush, I'll give you this pack of cigarettes before I leave, through the restraining cage\\"(wow, that would have been a liberal moment in history for sure).    This show, I enjoyed it of course, but not as much as Band of Brothers especially considering it jumped around so much I am still a little unable to recall the names of the big players, and I am glad it followed actual historical figures, it made me as uneasy like I said though, and not for the flame thrower incidents, cause I wished they would bring back the flame thrower for our soldiers in a big way.   My advice to others, even to myself, is to read more books on WW2 and the pacific theater.  Frankly, the ones I have read, even from ultra liberal sources, paint the Japanese Imperial Army as fanatical, bloodthirsty, deviant sadistic monsters, and definitely incompetent in military strategy(the repeated \\"bonzai charge\\" experienced through the war for instance) except later defensive strategies concerning fortifications.  Oh, but modern Japan still hunts wales AND dolphins for food, high price food of course, I suppose its a good thing China is stronger or their pandas would end up on modern japanese quisine as well, like panda sushi or something like that, but let us not forget the whales being hunted by them, still(yum yum?, I think not).  NO I WILL NOT PAY BUT ABOUT $35 OR LESS, FOR THIS SERIES ON DVD, I suspect it will go to about $40 in the next two years as a regular price which is probably when I will indeed purchase this along with blue ray BOB(having bought BOB as vhs, then standard dvd), probably haplesssly bundled to BOB, which will help me in the blue ray department by then.    I may not purchase this mini series at all, since I feel it was a hard slam against the WW2 American war effort in the Pacific, its definitely not on my \\"must have\\" list.  I am leaning pretty much toward the \\"never will purchase\\" side, a sentiment shared by several of my friends and several relatives, not just my humble opinion.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I have always thought this group had staying power and this cd proves it. All tracks are well done. Definately purchase.
B003K025V4|4.0|There are only a few minor changes that could be made to make this album a disney album. I mean seriously...these are all party hits. Don't get me wrong, there are many songs that are good. No surprise at all that she is not really singing any of these songs and if she is belting it out, its getting fixed in one way or another. that DOES NOT mean that they aren't good songs. i like some of the songs like \\"permanent december\\" and \\"liberty walk.\\" they are good songs, and meant for people to have a good time. some of the slow songs like \\"stay\\" could be taken out and that would be fine. overall, pretty impressive.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|Something pisses me off how many times can a bands catalogue be remastered and reissued in order to make the fans spend more money. Anyway i bought the single disc 2010 remaster cd yesterday and i downloaded the double disc edition with the bonus tracks i cant wait to hear them if i like what i hear i will go out and buy the $23 double cd. I like Exile On Main Street however there is no doubt it would have been better as a single album there are some weak songs on this album that just arent very good. That is the problem with lots of double albums there is filler well except for The Who's Quadrophenia. Exile On Main Street's best songs are<br />Rocks Off, Sweet Virginia, Tumbling Dice, Stop Breaking Down, All Down The Line, Ventilator Blues, Soul Survivor, Shine A Light, Let It Loose, Torn & Frayed. The rest of the songs i can do without even Mick Jagger said himself this album is not the bands best work. That should say something right there if the lead singer and co writer thinks that it is overrated. The 10 songs i listed are the great the others are weak
B0019N8P2W|1.0|I thought I would purchase these DVDs to relive a series from when I was younger.    The problem is that I can't play these discs on my computer, since I don't use Windows or Mac. When I try to play the DVD with MPlayer (on a linux machine) nothing happens. I have tried numerous other players on this machine, and other machines and still have similar problems.    I was able to play the discs on a friends Mac using the Apple DVD Player, but don't think I should have to purchase a new DVD player/computer just so I can watch these discs.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This album is so good, that when it was done playing, I ran out of the room screaming.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I was listening to a radio show on XM and heard \\"Tightrope\\" being played and thought it was really cool. But when I heard her speak about how she feels about music though, that made me want to pick up the album. I have to say without a doubt she is a breath of fresh air. She's insipring and has such an old school feel with that modern twist that the whole album is just an infection. There's really only one or two songs that kinda take me out of it but once it hits \\"57821\\" to the end it's so solid. Im to the point where I want to keep her to myself and not have her become popular and change but she is someone that everyone in every music genre should hear. Fantastic album and I definately recommend to pick it up ($9.99...it's COMPLETELY worth it).
1906694176|5.0|I was pleased with the speed of shipment and the excellent condition of the book.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|There were many times on this album that I just caught myself saying \\"Did he really just say that\\". This album is sick! One of the greatest hip hop albums ever made and his best period.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|This album is so cohesive, which may or may not be your cup of tea. It's like a beautiful musical trip that you just wanna take every single day! HANSON does it right with this one! Their music is always fantastic if you really give it a fair shake & a good listen. If you like catchy music that'll have you singing along all day this is the album for you! HANSON knows how to hook ya with their energetic fun sound! Believe me... you'll have this cd on repeat the second you start listening! Bravo guys, bravo!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|There has been many comments about Whitney Houston in the news and media.  To the rumors, the gossip, and the constant talking down, all I have to say is \\"Enough is Enough!!!\\"  Let those who have no sin cast the first stone.  What people seem to forget is that no one is perfect.  To YOU, Miss Houston, don't ever forget that the reason people talk about YOU... so much, is because they love YOU... so much.  Any one who says that they don't is most likely lying, if not to us then to themselves.  It's simple, either they love you or they love to hate the fact that everyone else does, and we all know that boils down to jealousy.  The truth of the matter is this, if they didn't love you so much (in one way or another) then they wouldn't spend so much time with you on their minds and saying anything about you would not be worthy of their breath.     As far as the album goes, there is only one thing that I need to say about Whitney Houston's latest LP release \\"I Look To You\\"; it's  great!!!  Whitney don't worry about all of the haters that's trying to talk you down.  You do what you do baby girl, because you do it so well.  \\"I Look To You\\" is classic all in it's own.  I say this not because it's by Whitney, but because it's good.  I am willing to admit that I was expecting this album to be like her Christmas album - uneventful.  I was expecting Whitney not to have any decent vocalist abilities because of what the media was saying about her.  Yes, I bought into all the mess that they were shoveling, but in the week that it was released, I bought the CD anyway.  Why, you may ask?  Because, when it comes to music, I TRUST WHITNEY and the fact that Clive Davis is in the music means that it's quality is going to be \\"on point.\\"  No Bobby Brown stuff up in here.  (Don't get me wrong, I like Bobby Brown music, but what works for one artist doesn't necessarily work for the next.  If it did then everyone would be a superstar.)  As far as this album goes, Guess what, I wasn't disappointed.  The quality is there.  The realness is there.  The passion is there.  Most importantly, WHITNEY HOUSTON is there.  This is an enjoyable CD.  If you don't own it , you need to pick it up and add it to your collection.       *The title track alone is pure inspiration in itself.  \\"I Look To You\\" is Classic Whitney.  It's open to so many interpretations that one can not help but relate to it.  Not to mention, the fact that Whitney sounds stunning.  This track is truly unforgettable.          *\\"Million Dollar Bill\\" is old school meets the nu' school.  Being a music artist and writer myself, I can easily tell that this song is everything that it's suppose to be.  Giving us a 70's feel with the drums, a new millennium feel with the lyrics, and a timeless feel of Whitney is what made it a hit that will surely prove to be ageless.  One year, ten years or fifty years from now, one will play this song and it will be just as fresh then as it is today.         *\\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" is the kind of the song that shows personal growth.  Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to relate to this song.  Since, we all know there are a lot of people in the world that still have some growing up to do.  Regardless, it's still a good song.        *\\"Call You Tonight\\" is a song about the possibility of new love.  We all know it well.  The first sparks of possibility.  The time when a relationship is just taking it's first steps of sweet nothings in your ears.  Whitney performed it well.  One of the best songs on the album.          *\\"Like I Never Left\\" features fellow artist Akon.  I was skeptical of this pairing, but I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised.  Another one of the bests on the album, this song is destined for the charts.  In fact, if they don't release this one with a hott video, then the one in charge is sleeping on the job and needs to wake up.  This song is all about undying love and WHO CAN'T relate to that.  Either we have it, or we want it.  Whatever the case, this song is one of the next best things that will allow us to either reminisce in the undying love that we have or dream about the undying love that we hope some day to be worthy of.        *Other songs include \\"A Song For You,\\" \\"Worth It,\\" \\"For The Lovers,\\" \\"I Got You\\" and \\"Salute.\\"  Which is one of my personal favorites.  It almost feels like she's talking personally to a certain somebody who's been treating her badly for years.  Don't it.  Don't worry, I won't name names, because I don't need to.  everybody knows who he is.  Anyway, the entire album is great music.          I Look To You has something for everyone.  Romance. Love. Spirituality. Self-Respect.  It even has something for the haters.  \\"Nothin' But Love\\" that is.  This song will even have them rocking back and forth to this jamm.  Whitney Houston is the woman that proves that even though her vocals \\"ain't what the used to be,\\" that she is still a force of nature.  True, she may not be as powerful a vocalist as she once was, but in the studio she is still well above the norm, which only proves she is still better than most of the top artist in the world today.  Congrats Whitney on an outstanding job.  I can't wait for the next studio album.  I just hope it doesn't take three plus years to get to it.   - *Dorrian Doniel Eugene
B001I0T92Q|2.0|Bought a couple of these things for use in a PSP. The very first one I purchased worked but I lost it. So thinking that it was a good product I bought 2 more. The first one of those did not work right out of the package, and the second on worked for about a week. I finaly gave up on them and bought an 8 gig made by Sony and have not had any issues with it.

0061120081|4.0|I already did a review on this product.  The book was in great shape--like new.  I just was a bit disappointed that the seller did not state that it was in paperback, but it has not hampered my enjoyment of the book.
0061245097|5.0|I enjoyed this one even more than the first in the series. The author did a great job \\"maturing\\" Cat's character, allowing her to grow strong without Bones, but yet still remain emotionally vulnerable where he's concerned. The pace was also better than in the first, and there weren't near as many contrived scenes - everything just seemed to flow better and was more realistic. I love the author's characterization of Bones - so committed to Cat, and willing to risk everything to get her (and keep her this time). The steam was great and although I got a little squeamish with all the talk of other lovers (never a highlight for me in romances or paranormals), the author did a great job of turning even that into a way of proving the strength of Bones' love for Cat. A great read, overall. Moving on to the next one in the series...
0156012197|5.0|I have had several copies of \\"The Little Prince\\" in several editions and languages. After several readings and reflections -- I see that this little work is one of the best in the World for primary spiritual wisdom. That it not only teaches Gentleness and Empathy -- but that typical limiting-blockages to spiritual-extension are covered well by the \\"typical human types\\" encountered by \\"The Little Prince\\" in his journey across \\"outer space\\". Other concerns [like fear and mortality] are covered well as well as can be. All of this via playful graceful poetic prose aided by playful yet expressive pictures by the author. It is also a fun way to learn other languages via side-by-side comparison of this work in different languages. \\"The Little Prince\\" is a fun way to increase in wisdom upon each reading and reflection. It does beg the question of just how the author got such Sufi-like Inspiration to create this Gem of Grace +++
B003K025V4|3.0|After her recent songs \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\" and \\"Can't Be Tamed\\", I have to admit that I was curious about Miley Cyrus' new album. 'Can't Be Tamed', as you can tell just by looking at the album cover, isn't necessarily what you'd come to expect from the Disney channel star. It's an album with a far more mature and aggressive sound: gone is the teeny-bopper songs meant to keep her Disney channel fanbase happy. Instead, Cyrus doesn't at all seem concerned about her image or her current fans. While the cover and the lyrics and video for the first single \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" suggests she's striking out and pushing the envelope, the album feels like a compilation of two smaller albums: there's a selection of very safe music fit for her younger audience where she sings about love, relationships and the usual teenage angst material and then there's a slew of songs where she sings about being controlled, mishandled and wanting her freedom. Of course, to me, those are amongst the albums' best music and tracks.<br /><br />The Good: What makes this album stand out from the rest of Cyrus' releases is that it doesn't at all feel like she's promoting anything. This isn't a release to promote \\"Hannah Montana\\" and that helps the album's appeal tremendously. The more mature material, from her cover of Poison's \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" where she keeps the lyric referencing making love to \\"Robot\\" where she seems to sing of her Disney experiences and having every aspect of her life controlled makes for good listening. The albums' best songs is when she sings about wanting her freedom - \\"Liberty Walk\\", while monotonous, is still a good and addictive pop song. \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" feels like an anthem for teenage rebellion and \\"Permanent December\\", while it sounds a bit like a kid-friendly version of Ke$ha's \\"Tik Tok\\", is a fast-paced, upbeat love ballad that'll have you listening to it non-stop.<br /><br />The Bad: I feel like the one thing that works against a lot of the songs is simply her voice. While her music is evolving and maturing, her voice sounds weak and untrained. It can carry the uptempo, pop tracks but when it comes to having to actually sing and exude emotion in some of the slower tracks, it falls flat and all that shows her lack of vocal abilities. Also, the predictable and slower tracks dealing with love and angst simply don't hold up against the albums' uptempo selections. Most of the slower tracks - \\"Stay\\", \\"Scars\\", \\"Take Me Along\\" - feel like the same track with similar lyrics with slightly different backing instruments. They, and her voice on them, really bring down the album. I'd rather have listened to a few more aggressive/angry tracks because she seemed to hit her mark and find her voice with those.<br /><br />In all, a decent album. I liked half of the tracks, which is more than I usually like from Miley Cyrus. Her vocals aren't exactly strong but it's her willingness to go personal and sing about her fame that makes some tracks on 'Can't Be Tamed' a must-listen. I'd suggest checking out the fast-paced songs because they are the best. The others definitely don't feel good enough to purchase.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"Liberty Walk\\", \\"Can't Be Tamed\\", \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\", \\"Robot\\", \\"Permanent December\\"r music is evolving and maturing, her voice sounds weak and untrained.

1442135034|5.0|\\"So much depends, she thought, upon distance; whether people are near to us or far from us\\".  So writes Virginia Woolf of the forlorn, but independent Lily Briscoe in To the Lighthouse.  There are so many adjectives one can use to describe how truly great this novel is.  To sum the action up  would be rather easy.  It's about the Ramsay family vacationing at a Scottish beach house in the early nineteen hundreds.  From the outside the action seems minimal, but Woolf constructs this novel from the inside.  We glimpse the inner workings of the characters on this little island.  We see their thoughts, weaknesses, loves, and losses.  As Woolf writes so much of the novel deals with distance.  Distance to time, to each other, and the perceptions we conjure in our minds.  This book on the one hand is about perceptions and how we perceive each other in life.  The whole novel is set as if it were in slow motion.  Very few words are spoken, but the ones that are take on important meaning in the story.  As I was reading I felt much the same way as Mr. Ramsay, James, and Cam thought as they journeyed to the lighthouse.  I allowed Virginia Woolf's beautiful prose to wash over me.  Her words moved much the same as a wave does; seemingly innocent at first, but packed with a punch that could knock you on your feet.  There are so many beautiful characters in this story from the elegant and motherly Mrs. Ramsay to the conflicted and sexist Mr. Tansley.  Perhaps my favorite part of the whole novel was the dinner scene.  So many sorrowful and joyous things culminating at once.  There were many times in this novel that I was almost moved to tears reading the descriptive sentences that Woolf weaves together.  I will admit that this was no easy read.  It may be only 200 pages, but each page lingers with the reader and begs to be slowed down; allowing the words to wash over them.  A modernist classic To the Lighthouse implements Woolf's stream of consciousness technique that many may find difficult or confusing to read.  My advice is to slow down.  You may get confused trying to decipher who's mind you are in. but after a while it begins to flow.  To the Lighthouse is true classic, and highly recommend it!
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|For album number seven, UK Electronic/Dance duo The Chemical Brothers (Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands) do away with guest vocalists and decide to go it alone. \\"Further\\" features just Tom Rowlands on whatever scant vocals there are, and Stephanie Dosen who appears on \\"Snow\\" singing the repetitive mantra \\"Your love keeps lifting me higher\\" against an insistent whine.<br /><br />Comprising just eight tracks, the album is sequenced like a live throbbing experience. \\"Escape velocity\\" is a euphoric piece that builds and builds to a dizzying climax with synths tripping all over the place, followed by the dreamy \\"Another world\\" with melancholic falsetto vocals.<br /><br />\\"Dissolve\\" is psychedelic Pop with a groovy feel, while the aggressive \\"Horse power\\" makes clever use of horse neighs with galloping beats and the title repeated in a vocodered voice as though in a trance. \\"Swoon\\" features bursts of noise like shards of glass flying about and forming a pretty picture sounding like My Bloody Valentine set to an electro beat, \\"K+D+B\\" features feathery vocals and electric sitar/bagpipe sounds, while the Coldplay-style Rocker \\"Wonders of the deep\\" shimmers and bubbles much like the Aurora Borealis.<br /><br />I'd be surprised if there are any hit singles as the whole album really needs to be heard together. A beautiful wall of electronic melody.

B0032Y8XH8|2.0|I don't know how anyone can praise the lyrics on this album. There is not a single original line throughout. It's obvious Mumford wants this to be a self-reflective album and it comes off, lyrically, generic. His \\"I think I could be a British-accented Oberst\\" voice lacks the vulnerability and touch of the Bright Eyes frontman and his lyrics offer nothing beyond the words. \\"It was not your fault but mine, it was your heart on the line. I really f*&^$ it up this time, didn't I my Dear?\\" has zero depth. He doesn't even try to explain what it is he f#$%^ up! \\"Weep for me, you'll never be what is in your heart.\\" Powerful. I think musically the album has something to offer, simply because a jamming banjo goes a long way, but I can't believe anyone would praise his lyrical or songwriting ability. I bet he says \\"Heart\\" 50 times, maybe more. I'm only giving this one example but this is spread across the entire album. I could write a lot more, like in \\"The Cave\\" he opens with \\"It's empty in the valley of your heart,\\" we've never heard that before... or \\"I won't let you choke on the noose around your neck,\\" strong imagery Mumford, I don't think anyone has ever used a noose reference (Hendrix, Soundgarden, The National, APC, off the top of my head). The whole opening to \\"roll Away your stone\\" is laden with overused references, every line has one! \\"Yours and mine, we'll see what we can find, don't leave me alone, i'm afraid of what's inside.\\" Then it gets REALLY good when he uses the \\"hole in my soul\\" line, I mean wow, no way! There's a hole in your soul? Aww you're so deep. I've listened to the album multiple times, and everyone I know that has heard it says they like it so much, but it's too hard for me to get past the laughably generic lyrics. They're impersonal at best, on what was obviously meant to be a personal album. Is there anyone that agrees with me?
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|SPOILER!!! If you've read the origins of Wolverine in any of the X-Men comics, this movie doesn't follow those very closely.    This movie is a great addition to the world of X-Men, tracing the scattered history of James Logan aka Wolverine. Starting with his conflicted childhood and progressing through his adult life with his brother, Victor, Logan comes across other well-known mutants such as The Blob and even a young Scott Summers, up until an epic battle with Major William Stryker and his \\"ultimate\\" weapon, Deadpool. Starring several big names such as Will.I.Am and Ryan Reynolds, X-Men Origins is a definite see-it for all Wolverine fans.    For anyone who stayed for after the credits in the theater, the post-credits scene in the DVD release is completely different.
030745455X|4.0|Unlike most reviewers, I found I enjoyed this book more than the first one.  Okay, I'll admit the writing is rather pedestrian, the investigation a bit tedious in parts, and Lisbeth is somewhat unbelievable as the pint-sized super woman.  Given that, I think Lisbeth is a far more compelling character than Blomkvist, and the book is better off for focusing more on her this time around.  If you want a quick, exciting page-turner, this is a good one.
0307592839|4.0|Imagine, if you will, the first time a qualified art critic saw a de Kooning. He/she probably didn't have a clue as to what, exactly, it was. But, it was SOMETHING special, and just possibly, magnificent. Such is one's reaction to Egan's... um... novel? short story collection? comic/cosmic meditation? No matter! Set in the world of Rock n' Roll (but no more about Rock n' Roll than \\"Moby Dick\\" is about fishing) this sprawling \\"mess\\" of a book travels through time, space, and mindsets the way Michael Phelps (used to) go through water. There's a line from an old Stephen Sondheim musical: in response to a query as to what the hero of the play is doing, a character says: \\"I don't know. But whatever it is, it's brilliant!\\" THAT'S \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad\\"!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I'm not going to take much time here. I usually never write reviews and I haven't bought an artist's CD in a while either. I bought Recovery to support the effort that went into a fantastic album. Admittedly I downloaded this when it leaked a few weeks ago, but I was so impressed by the lyrical content, metaphors, word play, flow, production, and subject matter that I had to spend my money on it. Fantastic album; his best in quite some time.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I'm more of a fan of rock music than hip hop, and I don't listen to a lot of rap artists. However, I've been a fan of Eminem for a long time. I liked The SS EP. I loved The MM EP and The Eminem Show. I think Encore is a very underrated album. I didn't like Relapse much.    As for Recovery, I would have to say that this Eminem's most impressive album to date. I admit that it feels strange writing that since nobody was expecting Em to put out a record of this quality at this stage of his career (especially after the recent mediocrity of Relapse), but you can't deny the sheer genius of this album. Em's undeniable talent is thoroughly on display throughout the record, and he leaves little doubt that he is truly one of the greatest recording artists of all time.    I rated each song below on a scale of 1-10, and grouped them according to their rating.       ---10---  4. \\"Won't Back Down\\"    9. \\"No Love\\" (best track on the record)   11. \\"Cinderella Man\\"           ---9---  1. \\"Cold Wind Blows\\"     3. \\"On Fire\\"      10. \\"Space Bound\\"      12. \\"25 to Life\\"         ---8---  2. \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\"   6. \\"Going Through Changes\\"      7. \\"Not Afraid\\"      8. \\"Seduction\\"      14. \\"Almost Famous\\"     15. \\"Love the Way You Lie\\"    16. \\"You're Never Over\\"         ----7---  5. \\"W.T.P.\\"      13. \\"So Bad\\"      17. \\"Untitled\\"
0385342039|2.0|This book was certainly different and a somewhat entertaining light read, but it goes on and on and on.  If this were a 250 page book, I would have rated it higher.  I just wanted it to be done the last 100 pages.
0307276902|1.0|I read this book when it first came out because one of my sober pals highly recommended it and because I was curious.  It took me three separate attempts--unusual, since I'm an unrepentant book junkie--to force myself past the first 30 pages.  If the story had been remotely compelling--that is, if it had held my attention and fostered the development of an emotional investment in the main character--I might have forgiven the lackluster writing that characterizes James Frey's memoir.  But his tale is flat, emotionally false and vacuous, and ultimately unbelievable--that is, I was unable to suspend belief that the events he described actually happened--that the pedestrian writing was like adding insult to injury. (I wouldn't be the first to point out that his prose suffers from the kind of hyperbolic sensationalism that characterizes mediocre writing.)  I forced myself to finish the book so I could have an informed opinion about \\"A Million Little Pieces\\"--since it was a hot topic of discussion around the rooms of AA when it first came out--but it was one of the most unsatisfying reads I can remember.  There's nothing in his book that is redemptive, uplifting, educational, or spiritually instructive.  In the end, it isn't even entertaining.  It's about an egomaniacal, violent, mean-spirited, self-destructive, authority-bucking, self-pitying child-man who wants to take the world down.  The only change he undergoes during the course of the book is that at the end he isn't drinking.  (P.S. Anyone can do that.  The difficult part is the transformation.)    Those with a firsthand knowledge of alcoholism know that drinking is not the root of the disease.  It's a symptom of a deeper illness which is a distorted perception of reality, a warped attitude about life that causes the individual to do many harmful, destructive things to himself and those around him.  If that goes untreated, even if the person quits drinking or drugging and survives, he'll mostly likely spend a miserable life hating and blaming others for the rotten hand he's been dealt, and remain too fearful or lazy to take the necessary actions to change that which is causing him pain.  It's a rotten belief system that has to be rebuilt from the inside out.  Unfortunately, that truth is not made apparent in this book, or it certainly does not shine forth as brightly as it should.      If the book possessed some redeeming quality, the fact that he'd fictionalized events in his life would not have mattered to me anywhere near to the degree that people here seem to have taken it personally.  It's discouraging for those seeking actual book reviews to be confronted instead with endless diatribes and character assassinations of the author about whom readers feel obliged to vent their vitriolic righteous indignation--because they feel he tricked them!  (If only people felt half as outraged at the lying done by their country's leaders before the execution of horrific acts.) The sadly ironic part is that all the notoriety surrounding the scandal of his having lied has only made him more popular and successful.      If you want a good memoir about alcoholism, one that is literate, humorous, compelling, and honest, read either Caroline Knapp's \\"Drinking: A Love Story\\", or \\"Dry\\" by Augustin Burroughs.  They are writers, for real.
B001TK80C0|5.0|My favorite of the Terminator movies. The female terminator is HOT in this movie and I don't mean her microchips. Easily the best effects of all 4 movies. Worth more than you are probably paying for it.
0307408833|1.0|I was so excited when I was given this book from a friend since I became a vegan and was already missing treats...

B000G6BM00|5.0|My favorite action/adventure/warfare movie ever. Sci-fi shoot 'em up sums it all up! This is not horror like the first one; this is humans kicking Alien rear by the hundreds with lots of nifty weapons and spaceships. All-star cast and MUCHO action guarantee this is in the history books. Buy it now!
B003HE2B9E|4.0|The main reason to pick this up if you already bought believe is for the 4 new tracks. Well at first it would seem that this a deluxe version of her second album but if you look at the track list you notice that there are 3 tracks from the original release missing. If didn't buy the original when it came out and you dig the new single then by all means pick this up. I believe the reason it doesn't have the all tracks is because of universal's new policy of keeping there new standard release under ten dollars. I mean which is fair. So do recommend this album because it is a great mix of radio friendly songs and guitar driven tunes. The price isn't too expensive so that is why I have given this re-release a 4 star review.
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek is too boring compared to Star Wars, some say. This changes that. This movie is about two ships and two captains battling for their lives in a duel to the death. Nemesis is the same concept. This focuses more on battle than drama. If you like a more action-packed form of sci-fi, this is for you. All-star cast including Ricardo Montalban(Fantasy Island.etc.) and the usual Star Trek original cast. Easily a better Star Trek choice along with Nemesis.
B002NPUCP8|4.0|So I saw the video for the song Highly Strung and I was so impressed I picked this up. Now the sound of it is very radio friendly and her guitar playing is really good so this is a good balance for me to listen to. The reason I give this album a 4 star review is that universal has re-released this album with 4 new tracks ( Believe (II)). This album doesn't include the new single (Shut Up and Kiss Me). So if you don't want the new single or the other 3 new tracks then pick this up because 3 of the tracks on this release are not on the re-release.
0784010188|5.0|A terminator from/on the X-Files?! What is the F.B.I. thinking?! All jokes aside, this movie is easily better than the first one by far. Excellent graphics and effects are what REALLY sells this movie. Linda Hamilton is B-UFFED in it as well. Sci-fi at it's finest!
B000059Z8J|5.0|The original superhero movie of modern times. Spider- Man had one in the 70's but was a joke, period. Superman I is still one of the better superhero movies ever made although with Iron Man released, is no longer the best. Some would say Batman was better as well. Worth buying if you ask me.
079075116X|4.0|This and Airwolf are the two best movies/TV shows featuring super-vehicles ever. Knight Rider, Blue Thunder; NOT EVEN CLOSE! If you like Airwolf, Firefox originated the concept. Airwolf is a helicopter but Firefox is a jet. If you like either one, you will like the other.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Warriors is the original Judgment Night. It is part gangster, part thriller type of movie. Intense, violent, \\"edge of your seat\\" is an understatement. Human survival in the concrete jungle and nobody depicts it better. One of my favorite movies, along with Judgment Night starring Emilio Estevez and Cuba Gooding Jr., ever made regardless of genre/category.
B000002INJ|5.0|True metal for non-posers. This is not Pearl Jam. This is not Whitesnake. This is not Poison. This is not Def Leppard. This is not Puddle of Mud. This is not Coldplay.  THIS IS REAL IN YOUR FACE PAGAN MEETALLL that you will not hear on the poser stations that claim to play rock and all they play is Seattle buzz and grunge which is the worst CRAP ever made. This is music Vikings would listen to on a raid if they were still around or they had it back then. Sounds like Dungeons&Dragons meets Metallica. Fast, wild, pagan, kicking METAL! No love songs. Period.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay!
B0002KVUKW|5.0|Special effects matching Underworld or Twilight easily. Hugh Jackman(Wolverine on X-Men) and Kate Beckinsale(Death Dealer on Underworld) star in this excellent vampire/werewolf, even vampire vs. werewolf movie. Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein's Monster are on this too. Easily a match for other movies in this genre. Highly recommended!
B00005221L|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever. Why this did not do as good as Terminator is a mystery to me. Easily the better of the two films by star power alone. Arnold(Terminator), Carl Weathers(Apollo Creed on Rocky), Jesse Ventura(The Body of pro-wrestling,Running Man),Sonny(48 hrs.) are just half of this cast. Special effects are modern to this day. One of the best sci-fi action movies ever made, period.
6302814782|5.0|The movie that started it all. This is it. THE ONE. The vampire craze started in the 80's with this movie. An all-star cast(Keifer Sutherland,Corey Feldman, Corey Haim and more) on the original Twilight. Make no mistake about it, this is THE vampire CULT CLASSIC that is a MUST HAVE for Twilight, Underworld, even Howling fans everywhere. Buy it if you have to sell your body to science!
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade fights super-vampires in this one. This one is especially bloody and gruesome. Like the others, martial arts meets the occult in an all-out war. Ron Perlman(Hellboy,Sons of Anarchy,etc.) stars in this one as  as a bad guy. Easily as good as the other Blade movies. Highly recommended!
B0000A2ZO1|5.0|The best of the Star Trek movies. More action than the others other than part 2. As in The Wrath of Khan, this part is all about WAR. Romulans develop a supership capable of fighting a dozen Federation ships at the same time. You get the idea. This is a must have for sci-fi fans, even ones who think Star Trek is boring. This changes all of that, A LOT.
B0000AFX64|5.0|Battlestar Galactica was Star Wars for television and like Star Wars in the 70's, was years ahead in special effects. Theater level quality on TV. 'Nuff said.
B000059XUI|5.0|The best of the Superman movies to this day. Watching Superman fight three Kryptonian villains with all his powers(you read that right!) is a TREAT for comic book and cartoon fans of all ages. This Superman movie is all about action whether a streetfight or Lois getting the \\"private tour\\" of the Fortress of Solitude. Two types of \\"action\\" for those of you who know what I am writing about. EASILY the best of the Superman movies!
078062369X|5.0|A popular vampire movie with lots of Karate like action. Wesley Snipes adds star power for an action flick few can match. Try it!
B00005N5S5|5.0|One of the most popular sci-fi movies ever made. This and Predator made Arnold the movie star he was and probably got him into politics as well. Multiple sequels guarantee this will be bought for years to come.
B00000EH6T|5.0|This is THE workout collection of all time! Eye of the Tiger, Living in America, Hearts on Fire, Burning Heart are just a few examples. This is designed to inspire and motivate you to better health and better life overall. To sum it up I would say this collection will \\"pump...YOU UP!!!\\"
B00004VVNB|4.0|Although outdated due to age a lot, this still sells on occasion. I bought it because I remembered it from my childhood. I do not think it to be as good as other movies even back then like Star Trek or Star Wars or even Battlestar Galactica on TV but for most sci-fi fans, this is a popular item. Farrah Fawcett(OG Charlie's Angels) makes a good showing on this movie as well. I would not pay a lot for this but if it is cheap and you want a \\"blast from the past\\", this is it.
030745455X|5.0|Buy the premise - check your mind at the door and hold on tight for a great ride. Another grabber!
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Look, people on the fringe right, want war, pure and simple.  They really don't care about the soldiers or killing the perceived enemy.  Rarely, does a war movie portray the whole picture. This movie is the stomach churning truth, about what really happened in Iraq.
0307454541|5.0|Slow at first - getting all the characters down pat & remembering who goes with who - but once you do it's a fast ride.  Super book!<br />Don't bother seeing the film - I did & it was a mistake because you don't get the full flavor of the written word & the movie combines scenes from \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" which makes it confusing.
B00005Y1Z4|5.0|Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret may be one of the greatest albums ever. Actually, it is. Marc Almond and David Ball deliver rich, beautiful and utterly unforgettable music.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I hate to sound all gushy over a workout DVD, but I loved this because I could never say \\"I don't have 20 minutes\\". It was easy to get myself up a bit earlier to do a 20 minute workout. I am already active, a vegetarian and physically fit. But, this DVD really did help improve my overall fitness level because I had really let my workout get stale. And, I could easily do the moves in my living room with minimal furniture movement.     This was a good, challenging workout. I always got sweaty, and always had a burn going on somewhere! I did feel like I got more of a workout with level 2 than level 3, but whatever. I did them all. Then, I switched back and forth from level 2 to level 3 for a few weeks. (I did this more than 30 days). Also, I didn't do this everyday. I did it 3-5 times a week, and went running on the other days because I don't do monotony very well. I have tried a few other workout DVD's (some I liked, some I didn't), and this one will be definitely back into the rotation in about 2 weeks. (Jackie Warner's Circuit Training was a nice follow up to this one).    For those who complained about the lead in commercials, etc before the workout, my advice is put it in and then go change into your clothes, etc. By the time you get done, it's ready. If it's still rambling on, do a few extra stretches or what ever.     I thought Jillian was excellent in explaining form. The set was well lighted and the camera angles were good at capturing what you needed to do and how you needed to do it. There were no 'quick switches', which was excellent. You can get a good workout from day one because there are no complicated moves or quick switches to another move. I don't care for DVD's that you need to 'practice' before you get a good workout. That's just a waste of time. But this DVD was not.    Shred II, please!
B000002L5P|5.0|This is one of those rare, beautifully created albums that appear on this planet once every so often. It enters your heart the moment it is played, grafting itself to your soul forever.
B00001W9G0|4.0|The Way We Were is a profound film of two people who love each other but can't seem to make it work due to their opposing political views. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford are movie magic together, their chemistry is electric and their acting is impeccable. I loved how honest this film was, the ending is sad but it's nice to see a romantic drama have a realistic outcome and not one that is wishy-washy or contrived. Definitely worth checking out, enjoy!
0307408833|1.0|Like so many other reviews, I was surprised to see so many spelt recipes which is not gluten-free, and I cannot use any of those recipes. Why is this called \\"Gluten Free\\" cookbook?  The recipes I tried turned out awful. Baked the Lemon poppy seed cake which tasted like alcohol because it called for 2 tablespoons of Lemon extract. Most recipes call for 1 tsp. It never set up properly the baking times are way off.  The pumpkin muffins were inedible my husband took one bite and threw it away.  The Chocolate chip cookies were okay but very flat.  The cupcakes were so dry and bland.  I have gone to the bakery several times and have purchased these items and the baked goods tasted completely different. I am very disappointed with the money spent and time wasted.   The cookbooks I do recommend are \\" The Flying Apron\\" \\" The almond flour cookbook\\"  Every baked good has turned out perfectly for me.
014241543X|5.0|If i Stay, wow were to begine... well i suppose here. This story is BEAUTIFULY written. It's a story of a young girl named Mia who has a loving family, amazing boyfriend, great best friend, and a future any of us teens would dye for. Unfortunitly Mia is thrust into a world of pain when all her family is killed. Mia is now forced to chose if she wants to live out the future she always knew she would have, or to dye with her loved ones.    I found this story inspiratinol, a true eye opener for everything i have. I dream of one day being able to write stories like Forman with all the emotion she puts forword. This book i highly recomend for pepole of all ages. It is a bit boring the first teen pages, but it's nessisary for the plot line. Keep reading. The book becomes verry emotinal and if you dont like emonitnal books this one is not for you, but to all emotional and heart-filled readers, this book is one of a kind.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|I've been listening to this on repeat since getting it.  The whole album has a nice flow to it and there aren't any \\"skip\\" tracks.  In spite of all the indie rock guests on here there aren't any \\"freak out\\" moments like on Phrenology.  If you like early Roots you'll enjoy this release as well.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|The AmazonBasics Universal Camera Case FF (Black) is made in China and like much of the products from there provides the customer with what is adequate and nothing more. For example, the strap handle for the case is what normally would be supplied with a small digital camera (see photo). The loop portion being just a thick thread instead of something more appropriate, like a clip.<br /><br />The Velcro base on the case is just large enough, effective length less than 1 inch, in size (see photo) to hold inside an exact fit item or smaller with the flap cover completely mated to the base pad. Stow in the case an item 0.25\\" (increasing the case circumference by 0.5\\") larger and the Velcro on the case flap makes only partial contact with the base pad and less than secure. Since this generic Universal Camera Case has to be purchased sight unseen and not a custom fit case for a specific camera, should have been more flexible in function (see photo).<br /><br />Giving the case a cheap, patchwork appearance is the miss matching cut Velcro base for the cover flap (see photo). Here it looks like someone grabbed an extra left over part for a different case and sewed it on.<br /><br />It maybe that the flush zippered compartment was a design afterthought. With a zipper integrated, prevented the use of a more practical and functional Velcro base pad. The small flush zippered side pocket is a helpful feature and will accommodate a couple encased compact flash cards. A naked SD card or Memory Stick swims about in this pocket and can be troublesome to remove after migrating into a corner.<br /><br />The belt loop on the case does not have a snap as a backup measure, but for the price, would not expect there to be one.<br /><br />As for the zipper pull tab and what looks to be the most expensive item on the case, would prefer it if Amazon simply used a subtle or single dark color pull tab. The AmazonBasics badge, in my opinion makes a cheap product look tacky.<br /><br />Considering the low cost of labor in China, the large number of cases that can be stuffed into a cardboard box and that I can purchase a similar product in Shanghai for less than $3.50 (20 RMB), would not be willing to pay a single penny more for this product then the current $5.99 selling price.<br /><br />Minus 0.25 for supplying a weak compact camera strap, instead of a real case strap.<br />Minus 0.25 for a Universal generic case having too specific functional tolerances.<br />Minus 0.25 for the patch work appearance of the Velcro base.<br />Minus 0.25 for the tacky and shamelessly badged AmazonBasic zipper pull tab.<br /><br />It would not surprise me to learn that some that dislike the review have a stake in the product.er of cases that can be stuffed into a cardboard box and that I can purchase a similar product in Shanghai for less than $3.50 (20 RMB), would not be willing to pay a single penny more for this product then the current $5.99 selling price.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|This 2009 BBC series was recommended by several friends but I thought, could I really stand yet another version of Jane Austen's Emma?  I finally caved and watched it.  This movie was highly recommended for a reason - it is the best version!<br /><br />I loved how the opening credits summarized the lives of three young children who lose a mother:  Frank Churchill, Jane Fairfax and Emma Woodhouse.  The first two are torn from the familiar and given to others to raise while the third gets to stay at home.  The background provided gives a much richer understanding of the characters when we meet them on screen as young adults.  This storytelling made the movie a whole new experience for me and I've seen three previous versions!<br /><br />In other versions of Emma, I thought her quite silly and could never understand her appeal (other then beauty).  This movie does a great job of fleshing out each character and the casting is perfect.  Kate Beckinsal\\"s Emma comes in a close second but this movie shines from beginning to end.

B00000K3D4|5.0|This is one of the top films of my youth, along with The Princess Bride, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Legend, The Clash of the Titans, and Time Bandits. David Bowie is over the top, sexy and evil at the same time, as the Goblin King. A young Jennifer Connelly plays a spoiled bratty girl of about 14. She is incredibly beautiful and the scene where she wears a gossamer dress to the Goblin King's masquerade--that stays with you for life. I wanted to be her so badly in that scene!

0891419063|5.0|After watching The Pacific I, like many others I suppose, obtained Sledge's memoir to learn more about the Pacific war, particularly the struggles of the Marines. The decisive battles of the Pacific war were fought mostly between aircraft and ships and finally sealed by the actions of a two bombers. Most people know of these events because of the spectacular film footage that has been presented but other than the Marines taking beachheads, the film coverage of their campaigns inland was fairly skimpy. It's understandable. Compared to the tank battles on the Russian front, land campaigns in Europe, massive bombing runs on Germany and the associated dogfights, the struggles of the Marines just didn't rise to the same photogenic level. In fact, most of the action seen by the Marines was close-in combat, sometimes man on man, and always terrifying. These were small unit actions that just didn't lend itself to the needs of the film makers. A disservice to the young Marines who fought and died for their country under the most gruesome of conditions. Sledge's memoir corrects this historical injustice. His relating of the campaigns at Peleliu, particularly Peleliu, and Okinawa are as fine and compelling as any memoir of WWII. To read this account is to understand why the Marines are what they are.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of the matrix trilogy. Each film comes on a a blu Ray disc with a plethora of special features. I read a review of this blu ray collection that said that though the films look great on blu, the first movie is the least impressive. Well I just finished watching the first Matrix movie and I must say that the movie has NEVER looked batter. Also on the disc are multiple commentary tracks, one being a track that breaks down some philosophical views of the film. It opened my eyes to a few things that, despite multiple viewings, i've failed to pick up on. Another commentary track focuses on people criticizing the films. Though I personally love the films and may never have any interest in listening to this track, I thought it was very interesting that the Wachowski brothers would want to include it. Included in The Matrix Reloaded special features includes all the live action scenes that were included in the Enter The Matrix video game. The story of Enter The Matrix was written by the Wachowskis and takes place concurrently with The Matrix Reloaded. This side story stars Niobe and Ghost. Unfortunately, the game was pretty bad. I tried it just to see the side story unfold, but I could not bring myself to finish the game. The inclusion of these scenes as a special feature is very cool. Buy this collection on blu Ray. You will not be disappointed.
1401224253|5.0|SRS presents a what if scenario where Kar-El's ship crash landed on an USSR collective farm in 1950s, instead of Kansas.  Superman quickly became the symbol of Soviet power drawing support from around the world.  After taking reins from Stalin, Superman successfully realized his vision of utopia in USSR and allied nations.  In contrast, America withdrew into political and economic isolation.  JFK served a terrible term as the president running the country to the brink of bankruptcy and political chaos.  Lex Luthor, a renown scientist and thinker, succeeded JFK and used his intelligence to resurrect America from the ashes.  The Cold War between the two great nations became a competition between two personalities of Luthor and Superman, which was, at its core, also a conflict between human free will and alien imposed \\"utopia.\\"      A special mention must be made of Batman who was the son of anti-Socialist dissidents murdered by Stalin's secret police.  This Batman grew up to be the most formidable terrorist in Moscow.  He saw himself as the liberating force opposing Superman's dictatorship.  Needlessly to say, Batman and Superman ended in a brutal fist fight (one of the best of its kind since The Dark Knight Returns).  This is a good example of how the author cleverly deconstructs traditional comic book heroes, making them totally fresh and familiar at the same time.  SRS is second only to Watchmen in deconstructing superhero myth and Cold War ideology, and in wrapping the cast of superheroes in a lean and unforgettable narrative.       The last pages reveal the secret connection between Luthor and Superman.  One has to read it to believe it.  It is mind-blowing and adds a twist to the story preceding it.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie. It was smart, it was action packed, and it even had a few kinda funny moments. All the characters were very varied and interesting. However, the ones that really stood out, of course, were Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach. I don't even know what to say, I was just so blown away by this movie. A must see! :D
B002N5N5M0|5.0|After a strong start with Seasons 1 & 2, Season 3 was such a disappointment.  So I was anxious for Dexter to redeem itself in Season 4 - and did it ever! John Lithgow was excellent as the villain - and I watched with anticipation every episode to see how it all unfolded. Season 4 had many interesting twists and turns and definitely renewed my faith in this series.  I can't wait to see where they go in Season 5! This is by far the best show on television. Watch it and Enjoy!
B0037RBVG0|5.0|Everyone seems to have a proprietary take on Elliott. People who came to him with this album will probably always feel this is the quintessential Elliott, whereas those who knew his earlier stuff tend to be put off by the more elaborate and rockist arrangements here.     This was my first contact with Elliott, and I quite fell in love with the album. I had been listening to Grandaddy's \\"Under the Western Freeway\\" and \\"Sumday\\" right before I started listening to \\"From a Basement. . \\", and as a result I at first deducted points from the album for less originality.     But the allegiance to Beatles forms really matters less and less the more you get in touch with Elliott's emotional state as he's putting the songs across. Repeated listenings reveal a craftsman at the top of his game, and an insistence on not engaging in self-pity. Even when he at first sounds self-pitying, you realize that hidden in that agony is a critque of himself, as well as a statement of alienation.     As with Jason Lytle of Grandaddy, your connection and amazement increases once you know all the lyrics. Your enjoyment bumps up dramatically when your understanding goes up from 80% to 98% (See [...] for lyrics). You understand how much Elliott was enjoying creating and singing these songs, and it makes it very difficult to believe that he would have wanted to kill himself after having created them. The album sounds like he's made it through his storms, and is at peace on the other side of them.     I think he actually sounded more depressed on \\"Figure 8\\" (\\"I have become a silent movie. . . \\"; \\"Better Be Quiet Now\\"; the song \\"Happiness\\"; \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\"; the morbid piano coda at the end of the album).     Here, he sounds more distanced from his pain, as if he's spent a lot of time thinking things through, either with or without a therapist. So the songs are felt, but also sometimes have an admirable level of detachment: \\"Coast to Coast\\", \\"Memory Lane\\", \\"Shooting Star\\", \\"Pretty (UglyBefore). Sometimes they're NOT detached: \\"The Last Hour\\" especially, and \\"Twilight\\", are a bit more direct and vulnerable. But the insistence on emotional truth remains the same throughout.     Elliott really is the spiritual heir of John Lennon, the guts on the floor Lennon of \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\". Like John, he knows how to work with \\"filters and masks\\", as Robert Christgau has observed about Lennon, and changes in mood, but it's all in the service of connecting with other people, and being vulnerable, not distancing himself from others.     XO and Figure 8 are fine albums. But \\"From a Basement\\" is equally fine, in its own way, and still just as shiningly honest. Elliott didn't want to repeat himself here. Don't disrespect him because he chose not to, and because he tried different arrangements and styles.     He was and is the real deal, here, as elsewhere.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Dear God where do I even begin with this one...    \\"It was a complete waste of time and money\\" would be a good way I guess. I cannot recall a movie that had me so bored and disinterested while watching. Embarrassment even crept over me for the people involved in this film, those who found an ounce of entertainment within it and my pathetic self for agreeing to go see it.    Sex and the City 2 presents our four aging ladies two years after the last installment and yet it seems like no time has passed by to them. Although their lives have changed somewhat, they still run around as if they were 30-year-olds, chasing glitz and Cosmos with the youngens. If you thought it was impossible, prepare to be impressed: Carrie surpasses her level of annoyance here. You'd think that finally catching the man she'd been chasing all those years would make her happy, but alas! The woman wants to hit the town while Big wants to stay home together and eat -gasp!- take-out. She wants \\"sparkle\\" in their lives while he's perfectly happy watching old black-and-white movies and snuggling in bed. She gets on her hubby's case over his feet on the couch so often that by the time she asks Big, \\"Is it because I'm a bitch wife who nags you?\\" after he suggests space between them, you just want to yell out \\"YES!\\"    As for the other women: Samantha is on the brink of menopause and fighting it with every pill/food/lotion she can find. Miranda up and decides to quit her job at the firm after her boss has trouble listening to an empowered woman. (Kudos to her for finally shedding her high-strung persona and just chilling out. It was long overdue.) And knee-deep in diapers and toddler tantrums, Charlotte's having a hell of a time maintaining that cheery disposition of hers. After Samantha comments on her nanny's reluctance to keep her big boobs in check, Charlotte's obsessive/jealous ways emerge.    When Samantha scores the girls an all-expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi, their corny nonsense continues inthe Middle East (Warning: a karaoke scene is included). Now, if someone found the plot to this film please let me know because to me it just seemed to be a succession of lavish scenes. In fact, Sex and the City 2 would have been better served as a slideshow with captions; the \\"dialogue\\" only popped in as filler between shots of luxurious locales and fashion spreads. I mean, did they really need to change twice just to ride a pair of camels? (In heels no less!) Better yet, did a camel toe joke need to happen?    I will say this, I semi-appreciated the mom heart-to-heart-over-cocktails when Miranda finally got Charlotte to vent. That could very well have been the only \\"real\\" moment in the entire movie. When Carrie committed a relationship faux pas overseas, my heart came back from the flatline. \\"Finally!\\" I thought, \\"Something might actually happen here.\\" But don't get your hopes up, kids. At the end of the day, this was just a serious letdown that couldn't end soon enough. And might I point out that there was barely any sex and there was hardly any city? That alone earns this negative toasties.    For more reviews, visit [...]
1423113381|5.0|***Quick edit - I am reading this to my 8-year-old and 5-year-old song now.  My younger one doesn't really get it, but my 8-year-old LOVES it so perhaps I was a little high on the age range listed at the end of my earlier review.***    My poor husband contends I can't shut up about this book so I must have liked it.  Two weeks have gone by and I am still thinking about it, I must have loved it.  The book was pure fun and adventure - really what more do you want?    While some readers may feel like this is just Percy with true siblings and Egyptian gods instead of half siblings and Greek gods,for me, the book stood solidly on its own.  I liked Percy and the Olympians series because of its fast pace, witty writing, and ability to give old myths new (and often crazy) life.  However, I don't know if I genuinely cared all that much for the characters - more like fun diversions or pleasant habits than people I couldn't imagine losing.  My feelings about Sadie and Carter are completely the opposite.  Riordan did a remarkable job fleshing out the siblings and their relationship.  I found myself constantly comparing the nature of their relationship and dialog to another popular book with siblings (The Alchemist series) and Riordan's portrayal is so much more realistic.  I also know less about Egyptian mythology and in many ways that made the Red Pyramid more enjoyable - I wasn't constantly fact checking or comparing the book to what I thought I knew.    I do know I will be pre-ordering number 2!    Parents Note:  I read out loud to my young boys every night and I would probably hesitate to read this to them until they are in the 9-10 age range.  This is not because of inappropriate content (although a few of the scenes/characters are a bit frightening), but more  because the character/terminology list is pretty long and some of the mythology is a bit more  complicated than with the Percy series.
1401923119|5.0|Bruce Lipton is truely an innovator. His New Biology turns many previous ideas about genetics on their head. The proposal that the mind can heal is not new, but that it can promote the potential of an individual's genetic material is almost unbelievable, except that Lipton is able to paint a picture of those processes so clearlly, that one wonders why no one had  done it before.   I congratulate the author on presenting such a deeply scientific subject in such simple and understandable language, even for people who are not scientifically minded.  This book should be read especially by people who intend to have a baby, as an important part of the book deals with environmental influences on the fetus in the womb and on the newborn during the early developmental years; influences that effect the newborn for life.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis, thanks to his wall street background, understands the psychology of the people who make up this fascinating but murky world. Through the individual \\"micro-cosmic\\" stories of Steve Eisman (Frontpoint Partners), Michael Burry (Scion Capital) and Greg Lippmann (Deutsche Bank) - people who profited from their bets against the subprime crisis, Lewis creates a gripping account of what led to the collapse.<br /><br />It is particularly interesting to understand how these successful people experienced the other stakeholders - Goldman, Morgan Stanley, AIG, Moody's, Merrill, etc. as the crisis unfolded.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />PS - One point of caution - The book is mostly about what happened between 2004 and 2008. If you are looking for a book that describes the crisis after Bear/Lehman's collapse and the government response, this book won't do.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|I. Can't. Stop. Listening. To. This. Album. It really gets back to The Roots'...well, roots. It has an old-school feel to it, but not in a dated way. The lyrics are intelligent, the beats are sick and the album is consistent through and through. I actually really like the bonus track, Hustla. The auto-tuning of the baby's cry is haunting and absolutely captivating to me. I was afraid with their move to the Jimmy Fallon Show that their music would fall off, but it makes me ecstatic that this album came out as one of their best in years. Worth the $8 people, really.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|For a used DVD it wasn't too bad, there were about three places that had \\"skips\\" in them, pauses and then the movie continued on at a different spot.  Maybe with some disc cleaner it will clear it up, but I thought it was a bit unusual for a new movie DVD to have those flaws in a fairly new disc so soon.
B003HLM2QO|1.0|I listened to this album, and in no way do I find this album to be anything short of a BIG letdown. I think Ozzy has lost his writing ability, and his voice is just not that good anymore. The songs don't have the power like Ozzy's previous stuff. Where is the good stuff like \\"Mama I'm Coming Home\\", & \\"Dreamer\\"??. Those were great songs by a gifted artist. But not anymore. I hope Ozzy does ok on tour. I heard it's worldwide. At 61, He should just hang it up.
0671004107|5.0|I thought this book was excellent.  Sagan does a wonderful job of predicting the reactions of various people --given their occupations, ideologies, worldviews, etc.---were contact with extraterrestrial civilizations ever to be made.  Sagan's insight into Ellie's character is understandably, considering his own work as a scientist, apt and in depth --in my opinion.    The debates between the scientists and ecclesiastics were something all too real for me, and I thought the interactions between different governments, and their marked suspicion of each other, was both appalling and accurate.  One of the hallmarks of GOOD science fiction, in my opinion, is the ability to use real science within the story (of course the occasional divergence into the purely theoretical is sometimes necessary for things such as interstellar travel) and in this respect Sagan hits the mark head on.  Definitely one of my favorite science fiction books, apart from the works of Adams and Asimov.  I will be giving this book as a gift to a few choice friends.
B003KT3NRA|5.0|A cool album from Vince Neil, good choices for the covers, and also , i really dig the first single \\"Tattoo & Tequila\\". Great to know that some members from Slaughter are playing on this album. If you liked Exposed, and the party songs from the Crues , this album is for you !
B002XKUWVM|5.0|The ultimate compilation?<br />Sounds and looks like it, some classics, some new and a video !<br /> The prefect companion to ant serious Foreigner fan.<br /><br />Got my copy after the show in Los Angeles.<br /> A must have !
B003FXXNBW|5.0|This movie is an A+ if you are looking for a great movie about fighting.    Boyka is a great protagonist. He will keep your interest in the movie even when there is no fighting going on.    As for the fights, they are amazing. The crew for Undisputed 3 put together a great cast of international talent for the tournament fight scene. Scott Adkins, who plays Boyka is great as aways. But look out for Marko Zaror who plays Dolor. That guy does some insane flying spinning kicks. No wire work here. All the flips and amazing kicks you see these guys perform is real.    Great final fight as well, that has a pretty shocking ending.    I got this movie to see cool fight scenes and this movie delivered.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This remains one of thier best for a slew of factors;  1- Its the last LP to feature the original line up including the venerable Mr Jones who adds deft touches of slide, harp & percussion on misc trax.  2- Thier songwriting was seldom to be this good ever again (Salt of the Earth, Stray Cat, Dear Dr, Factory Girl, Street Fighting Man Jigsaw Puzzle)  3- This LP marked a return of sorts to the Stones more blusier or earthy roots coming on the heels of the oft mis understood Satanic Majesties & to great results.  4-It marks the introduction of producer Jimmy Miller (Traffic/Spencer Davis)& that union proved to mark for many the Zenith of the Stones in regard to the overall consistency of thier releases, production values were never better.  5-This LP achieves a great dynamic that the other lp's in the Miller catalogue would follow but seldom top. The album has it's very introspective items like No Expectations & Salt, Rockers like ST Fighting, Stray CAt & Parachute, politically charged songs like Sympathy & Street but more imprtantly it has its lighter moments like Dear Dr, Prodigal Son & Factory that serve to take the edge off the heavier stuff.  6-The reissue is very impressive (SACD) sounds spectacular & that's coming from a vinyl freak. This version has quite unbelievable detail especially on the acoustic guitar which predominates this lP. I would say this was one of the better remasters (ABKCO) that I've heard.  7-Just buy it.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Em delivers in this one.  His last ablbum I wasn't feeling compared to the his other projects, but wow, EM has to be one of the most gifted mc's out there.  That one track he has with Lil Wayne, I think track 9, I was floored with his delivery.  If you love Em like many of us do, how could you not like this?  Definitely my hip hop album of the year so far.
0446563048|4.0|Delivering Happiness, the new book by Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, goes immediately onto my list of must read books. I had already recommended it to several people before I even finished it. While the book wasn't exactly what I was expecting, that's just fine by me. I thought this might be a how to provide better customer service book. And while that might have been fine, what Tony created was something much better and much bigger. Just as Zappos is a superior customer service experience generator that happens to sell shoes, this is a happiness generator that happens to be a book.    Maybe it's the transparent way he treats both his personal and professional triumphs and failures (sorry about that worm farm dude) or the similar personality traits I share with him, but I felt a connection while reading the book. I believed I was part of one of Tony's tribes, or at least I'd really like to be. See I'm already on a first name basis with him, I hope he doesn't mind. ;) I like being around positive people who thrive on continually learning and questioning things and trying new things, new ways. Like Tony, I don't mind making mistakes as long as I learn from them.     The book is refreshingly humble, conversational, reflective and open. We get a glimpse into his early years and how he became the man he is today. From the beginning he was an unconventional thinker, willing to take calculated risks. He was thinking outside the box long before shoe boxes became his focus. He recounts a Shakespeare class in which he fulfilled a sonnet assignment (14 lines of iambic pentameter) with lines of Morse code. Luckily the teacher had a sense of humor. Tony was creating fun in a productive way, a trait that would carry through to his professional life. Fun is essential to building community. Laughing bonds people is a way that few other activities can. So don't mistake people having fun at work with a lack of focus, productivity or seriousness.    Similarly, don't discount the importance of play. Much can be learned from games, as Tony learned at the poker tables. While you'll have to read the entire list for yourself, there's a lot of solid advice including: \\"It's okay to switch tables if you discover it's too hard to win at your table.\\" By staying flexible and being willing to adapt you will have much more success. He also uses poker as an excellent metaphor, distinguishing between short (tactical choices and events such as the loss of a single hand) and long term thinking (focusing on strategic choices).    Finally, this book lets us in on the core values of a great company. You many not be able to go to Las Vegas and go on a tour of Zappos but you'll feel like you did. Tony's success arises not from his desire to make money but to find projects that would keep him emotionally engaged and, even more importantly, to create a community and culture. A friend of mine told me years ago, \\"do what you love and the money will follow.\\" If ever I doubted the validity of that statement, Tony is the poster child for following your passions and convictions. His desire to connect with people blurs the lines between business and pleasure. You can hear his excitement when he talks about fighting over the dinner check with vendors and it's 100% believable when he talks about the employees of Zappos being a family.    This book doesn't seek to tell anyone how to run their business but it does encourage people to ask questions about how and why they do this things they do. Tony is clear that he doesn't think every company should follow the same core values as Zappos but should stay true to the values that work for them. And he encourages each of us to make small changes personally and professionally on an ongoing basis to grow and improve.     Toward the end of the book Tony says that he wrote the book \\"to contribute to a happiness movement to help make the world a better place.\\" I'd have to say, this is another thing he can check off of his to do list. He has proven that there is a different way to succeed in business and in life. Choose happiness.    (I previously posted this review on my personal blog at [...])

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|A dream Cyndi Lauper had whereby jazz pianist Oscar Peterson stated he liked her version of Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Goin' On,\\" and suggested she should revisit some old songs, and make them modern, the way Janis Joplin did,  inspired her to make a blues record. Newly signed to Downtown Records, Lauper wanted to explore  a new musical direction with no compromises. Recorded in Memphis with  legends such as Allen Toussaint, B.B. King, Charlie Musselwhite,  Ann Pebbles, Johhny Lang, and veteran Stax Records session players, Lauper wanted to make a record with a pure, live sound, and she got it right.<br /><br />  It takes a lot of chutzpa for a white girl from Brooklyn to  attempt such a project, and during the recording sessions, Lauper admitted she heard this voice in her head whisper \\"You know everyone else will be more that good, but I might not be good enough.\\" She needn't have worried because she more than does  justice to the 12 classic blues songs served up in her unique vocal  style, covered in  Memphis Blues.<br /><br />  Standout tracks include  the classic, \\"Romance In The Dark,\\" penned and originally performed by Lillian \\"Lil\\" Green who died of pneumonia at age 34 in 1954,  Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroads\\"  and  Rollin' And Tumblin' a duet featuring  the legendary Ann Peebles.<br /><br />  Dedicated to Ma Rainy, mother of the blues and all the early blues artists who travelled through the cross roads, suitcases in hand, Cyndi Lauper hits the Blues and Jazz Festival circuit this summer to perform material from this standout recording and will surely win many new fans. Recommended listening and an excellent move forward from a recording artist who continues to surprise and thrill!<br /><br />  If sales from this recording warrant it, hopefully Lauper will give serious consideration to a companion volume  paying homage to  female blues singers like Ma Rainy, Big Mama Thornton, Alberta Hunter, Bessie Smith, etc  and delving further in the songbook of Lillian \\"Lil\\" Green, all legends who need to be re-introduced to a contemporary audience.  Sheboppin' the blues indeed!o be re-introduced to a contemporary audience.  Sheboppin' the blues indeed!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|I am 41 and am an Ozzy fan for life.<br /><br />Thank you Ozzy for not falling in the AC/DC trap of every song sounding the same.<br />\\"Scream\\" has something for everyone.<br />Great CD, it's all I can say.<br /><br />I love ZAKK and Jake E. Lee and of course RR, Gus G gives some new life to the Prince of Darkness.<br />If you read the liner notes, Zakk and Ozzy are still close it was just a business choice.<br /><br />All the talk about Gus G, I like the new Bass in this Cd. If you have twin 12\\" in the trunk, you may want to check the warranty....the bass in this CD rocks. I also like the accustics from Gus G.<br /><br />Great CD, worth every penny. I wish I would have pre-bought and got the bonus track. Also there is (another) bonus track on the Asian copy. I hope to hear those as well.<br /><br />We should get one more CD from Ozzy before he calls it quits.<br />Part of me hopes he keeps the same line up, and the other part hopes he follows the footsteps of \\"Slash\\" and calls in  Metallica, Linkin park, POD, Sabbath, Kid rock, Etc. and makes a 20 track farwell CD.
031606792X|1.0|How can it be... I'm even surprised myself \\"reading\\" this book until the end. I write \\"reading\\" because I did not really read it. I just wanted to know the \\"so what\\" that would complete the story. The main character is spending more than 50% of the time crying on herself. 10% is real action and 40% is \\"blank filling\\" with \\"what else could I write to reach my page quota\\". So YES it is really disappointing and I do not recommend this stuff at all. Waste of time not to write waste of money. The amazing thing is the power of the marketing noise done around this book. I will be more cautious next time. I really think there was a better book to write (and to read) with such an idea. Lack of creativity??? I don't know if I will be reading something else from tis author.
