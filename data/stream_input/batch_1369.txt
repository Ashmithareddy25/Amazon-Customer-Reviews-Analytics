B0054JZC6E|4.0|App is great!! I've been able to enjoy endless fun with this app and have had no trouble with it.
B000063DFQ|4.0|The songs on this are catchy and well crafty.  Piece of Mind seems to lack a little of the magic of Number of the Beast though it is in the same style.  However, it is a great album.  What I usually say to the critics of heavy metal is, \\"If you can play it.  I'll listen to your criticism.\\"  And, when I say that, I mean from start to finish, and not just the easier parts.

B000000H7I|3.0|The musicianship and effort put into making this album is tremendous.  The problem is all the songs pretty much sound the same (to me).  I would imagine most people would find this album indistinguishable from Pierced from Within.  Why have an album at all, if they are going to be the same?  There are some really good songs on this one though.  As far as death metal goes, Suffocation is among the top 5 bands.  I was lucky to see them play live once, and they were awesome!  I would imaging Lamb of God fans would really like Suffocation.  However, I myself, lack understanding of what Lamb of God and so many of these bands that all seem to use the same distortion sound, and the same cookie monster voice for song after song.  It's hard to have different emotions about these songs.  They go from fast angry aggression to slow pounding mosh pit aggression.
B0059XTUMC|5.0|The silent movies gave way to the \\"talkies\\" in the 1920s - due in part to new technology. However, people took to the new genre in order  to escape their everyday lives, and to think about other things than the shaky economy.<br /><br />Enter 2011/2012!  We have a weak, unsteady economy, and people are longing for an escape into simpler story lines without all of the car chases, explosions and special effects. The timing of the release of The Artist couldn't have been more perfect. It is such a refreshing change of pace from the high-tech world. And for an hour and 40 minutes, one forgets that it is an impersonal, complicated world out there...<br /><br />The cinematography was perfect, the acting spectacular, the screenplay clever, and the concept absolutely brilliant! Top all that with the most adorable dog Jack (played by Uggie), and you have the makings of a WINNER!<br /><br />Have already seen it twice. Can't wait until it comes out on DVD. This will be a classic!
B007E6YYLO|4.0|This episode continued the fast paced action we've seen since the mid-season return. The action is spread throughout and the dialog seems to be getting to a place where the arguments that were slowly boiling are starting to get more honed.<br /><br />My issue is currently the static nature of some of the \\"dark side\\" members of the cast - we continue to see them make bad decisions (this episode really highlights that) yet the group keeps them around, with little more than a slap on the wrist. I hope that either they begin to change their nature and grow, or the group sees the true hazard that they represent and removes them.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I waited for the DVD release before seeing PUSS IN BOOTS and I'm sorry I didn't see it in the theaters. I didn't expect PUSS IN BOOTS to be so much fun and it was a pure laugh a minute. Great animation, vivid colors, and delightful realism in places. Of course, it is hard to resist Puss when he does his wide-eyed look. Plus, Antonio Banderas Spanish accent is just wonderful as he plays the lady-charming, swashbuckling Puss in Boots.<br /><br />We learn the history of Puss in Boots and that Humpty Dumpty was his best friend..like a brother..but one who betrayed him turning Puss in Boots into a WANTED but innocent criminal.<br />The movie is almost more for adults than for kids. This is a darker version of some beloved fairy tales. This time, Jack and Jill are a nasty criminal duo. Somehow it's this Jack that has the magic beans to grow the beanstalk to the sky. Soon it is Jack and Jill against Puss in Boots, Humpty Dumpty and the lovely Kitty Softpaws for the magic beans and the chance to steal the Golden Goose.<br /><br />Puss displays a lot of attitude and Banderas has the voice down perfectly. There is also a moral tale at times here about abandoned animals and the reason Kitty has \\"softpaws\\".<br /><br />PUSS IN BOOTS is just a totally fun movie. It's silly but all in good fun. It's a great movie when you just want to relax and have an adventure.
B0063GORYU|5.0|its a fun game I love it u should try it nd its very relaxing<br />yayyyy I play it a lot ha ha ha !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|Wonderful movie, it came in an excellent condition! My son was very excited when he first saw it! I am very satisfied with my purchase and prompt service from Amazon!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Ok so let me just say that I love this game. ok so there is this boy I like and because of this game me and him have gotten alot closer. So now ever time we have free time class we start listening to music and we play the game together as a team. I love this game!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Ok, I DO like this app, but I am searching for one with less invasive permissions. Also monthly quota is too low to be useful. I am going to try Springpad to compare.<br /><br />Update 2012.09.25 - tried Springpad for a month or so alongside Evernote, then junked it. In retrospect, for all the hair-pulling and tooth-gnashing over permissions, I've decided it doesn't matter. Don't look for privacy in any electronic medium. Evernote is the one. Updates have been frequent for the pure Android version, not so much for the maddening locked-down Kindle version. Still love my Kindle Fire, but my new sweetheart is a Google Nexus 7. In the Jelly Bean environment, Evernote really shines.<br /><br />Update 2013.04.13 - I've come to regard Evernote as indispensable. It's on every device I own, custom built PC, HP Envy 14, Goggle Nexus 10, Google Nexus 7, Samsung Galaxy Note 2. If I could install it on my refrigerator or toaster, I'm sure I would.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use and does exactly what it says it does. Works great on the Kindle Fire. I use it every day for work and home.
B007E6Z94U|5.0|I can understand some of the complaints about season 2 from the other reviews.  Personally, I have enjoyed every episode of this series.  I think this episode (18 Miles Out) is the best of the series since season 1 episode 1.  I will not include any spoilers but just want to say that if you have been missing the zombies in previous episodes of season 2, perhaps this one will be more to your liking.
0061969656|5.0|A very happy fan of Bernard Cornwell. I try to read as many of his novel as I can. I love the historical fiction.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|One thing that really irritates me is when an app askes me 2 review an app. But it is a very fun app and has some fun games. A few games are classics and a few are new. check out words wth friends, it is very fun ;-)
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|How to even review this is a daunting task. First, I'm not a musician. Second, I'm not a touchy-feel y bleeding heart person and really am mostly logical, not very emotional in my reaction to things. I do love music and do feel the emotion in its many forms and this is my favorite of all time. The visuals in this movie blew me away and then to add the music moved me in ways I didn't know existed. I do love a good movie and this is my all time favorite. As a mom I felt the pain and sweetness that only a mother could know. As a wife I understood the fracturing of feelings from father and child and complicated loyalty that the mother has to remain consistent with. What Terrance Malic was able to convey in this film was nothing of short brilliant. To those who can't get past the first 1/3, I'm very sorry. My 23yr old son and his friends all watched it with me and the reviews were very polarized. My son (apples falling close to trees:)) loved it and it made him want to one day be a father who shows love much different than the one in the film (although the character  does love his family, he is unable to connect deeply and in ways that they need). A couple friends fell asleep and one just thought that it was terribly boring and didn't think it had a plot. I just smiled and felt pity for the poor fellow- a great guy anyway!<br />I can't admit that it isn't for everyone because in the right mindset anyone could do some  soul searching from it and that alone makes it worth it. To those offended- This isn't just about God. It's about a family and how they try live.
B0006N2EZ0|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and was really disappointed. I don't really understand why in the last 20yrs.Hollywood thinks that because you are an recording artist or an athlete, that you somehow are and actor. To me an actor is someone that causes you to forget you are watching an actor or a movie and you get caught up in the plot. If you got caught up in this acting you must watch a lot of cartoons. Along with Waterworld, this has to be one of Kevin's flops. I'm sorry Whitney is gone, she had a great voice, but like Diana Ross , she should have stuck to singing and left the acting to professionals.
B003K025V4|5.0|I have always loved and supported Miley Cyrus and I still do. This cd has a mix of dance-like songs and slow meaningful songs. I think Liberty Walk is a very inspiring song. It's definitely one of my favorites. These songs are nothing like her Hannah days so if you were hoping for some HM, you won't really find it in this cd. Some songs are very edgy-pop using autotune; which I didn't care for at first but they grew on me. Overall, this is a fun cd with a few slow love songs. It's worth the buy, nonetheless.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because it is so user friendly.  Once you download the versions you use most, you can use this app even when the internet is not accessable.  It is great for following along in church, at Bible study or for your own personal use.  The only downfall is that you cannot download the NIV version for use without internet access.  I use it every day and enjoy the ease of searching through the Bible it gives me!  I also like the way you can switch with ease from one version to another!  I can't say enough positive things!  This is a great app!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|So Amazing!!! Beautiful, well crafted, excellent acting, character development, just overall fantastic! A True work of art, and Masterpiece Classic at its best. Highly Recommended.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Five stars for what it is: a non-technical non-mathematical overview summary of current  consensus regarding cosmic inflation research findings written in an engrossing and engaging style with a respectful tone toward opposing opinions. Its a page turner and an informative one at that. Its not a textbook or a defense of inflationary cosmology. It lacks a mathematical or technical addendum, a bibliography, foot and end notes. Krauss could have provided more detail in places without detracting from the overall economy of his art. Nevertheless, this book has whet my appetite for more physics of inflationary cosmology and curiosity for learning about quantum mechanics.<br /><br />(Krauss did not mention De Broglie-Bohm Pilot Wave Theory in the book, but I have to wonder if Andrei Linde's Chaotic Eternal Inflation model can or has been formulated in terms of Pilot Waver Theory? If so then, the bat guano lunacy of the Copenhagen interpretation's notions of consciousness collapsing mathematical wave function models as if such mental symbolic collection of ideas could or do really exist, could be dismissed as so much crankery.)<br /><br />Anyway, the book is a worthy read and is worth the paltry price. I've read it twice on the Kindle and will read it again after a bit of studying inflation and QM.<br /><br />For those who wish to engage me in debate on these issues, I will disappoint you as I will not have time for such fun and games.
1439152799|5.0|Could not put this book down.  It's like a puzzle you want to complete!  From 1940's WW2 to 1990's, the characters are well defined by the author, yet just when you think you understand one of the women, a twist occurs.  Kate Morton has written a well-paced mysterious tale that some might find too long or dragged out.  I didn't!  There was no need to turn back any pages...her details stay with you.  I enjoyed the suspense!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|can be tedious but generally entertaining.  a lot of different games keeps the whole idea fresh enough to be consistently playable
B00415ZW58|4.0|I bought the DVD because I thought I would get a version that would show the wedding.  It didn't show the wedding. Sell the Taiwanese version with the wedding, and I will buy it. The cover on the DVD is very misleading.  I was so very disappointed...But I still love Down with Love.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|If you love music, simple storytelling, have a heart and a soul, you will love this film.  So incredibly moving and stirring. The people in this film touched me so deeply...I can't even call them characters because I felt as though I was watching real people having an experience in their lives. A standing ovation to the two singer/song writers/ musicians and director.  An absolute gem of a film.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|After looking around the web for a highly recommend blu-ray that is the best to show off HD television It became pretty much between Baraka  and this! Both have great hd but this seems to win out for me!! Beautiful photography!

B000LB7G00|5.0|Love the ability to use the 3D mouse in one hand and regular mouse in the other.  The 3D mouse is super sensitive and it doesn't take too long to get the hang of it.  If you work with parametric modeling software this tool is a huge asset!
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Got this to replace an M-Audio pre-amp.  Saw this for the price.  You cannot beat this price. Simple setup and runs quiet.  The only problem i have is that there is no on/off switch. That an the blue very illuminating light that is way too bright when the device is on.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've read thousands of sci-fi books in my life. I'm the exact right age for this book (45) and I get all of the references.  For me, this book was wonderful and I didn't want it to end.  I rarely read a book where I don't guess what will happen but this books is one of them.<br /><br />I could not put this book down.  The characters were written well, the story pulled me along and I was amazed at how the author kept pulling new material out of his hat all during the book.<br /><br />I think there could easily be a sequel to this book and I sincerely hope he writes one.  I want to know what happens next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun but some of the games are to hard and cost to much points<br />which kinds sucks. e r g g

B003YFIUW8|2.0|i was so excited to read this book for such a long time because so many people had said how good it was. man were they wrong. i absolutely love to read but this book is excructiating to finish... im only 70% finished and had to write a review about how ridiculous it is. the narration of the book is only cute for the first few chapters and then its annoying. also it would have been nice if something had actually happened... i kept waiting and waiting for the plot to expand or thicken or something but nothing has happened and while it is a tragic, heart wrenching tale.... it is absolutely so boring... please dont waste your time
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games, some are quick, some are challenging, and a very nice verity of games. This game will keep you playing every day. You will enjoy.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|My son surprised me this last christmas by getting me this Mono box set.I worried that he had spent too much,but he said he got a good deal from Amazon.I didnt have enough money to buy the stereo box when it came out on my 56th birthday in 2009.So I had to buy them a few at a time.This Mono box is so awsome.Not only does each disc  come with a resealable plastic cover but also paper and a a little bag  to put the disk in.The Sgt pepper liner is a perfect replica with various shades of red just like my mono vinyl Sgt pepper has.Since I had been used to Sgt Pepper in Mono,since my first copy was mono,the stereo one I replaced it with didnt sound as good.Well at least with some of the songs like Shes leaving home which on the Stereo one is slowed down somewhat.Also on the Sgt Pepper reprise song,I couldnt hear Paul yelling in the background at the end of the song as well.This was one of the best gifts I have ever recieved.A must for a dedicated Beatle fan.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is great for people who have a lot of time on their hands. for those that don't it could get pretty annoying.

B00005B5L4|5.0|If you're an audiofile or just like incredible audio, this is a \\"must own!\\" Forget everything you think you know about this album from the past.  This DVD Audio recoring of \\"Rumors\\" will knock your sox off and send your jaw crashing to the floor with a tremendous thud!<br /><br />It's like experiencing this music for the first time all over again, only incredibly better!  Crystal clear, up-front, in your face vocals and instramenatal imaging like no other rock recording I've ever experienced.  This is a reference quality recording that will test the metal of any high-end system.<br /><br />Kick back and re-live the 70's at a level of audio quality that would have sent people to the nervous hospital if they would have heard this back then.  This is simply the best you will ever hear anything from those great rock years!

B0018QOIXU|2.0|This album is a disapointment to Adele 21. The voice isnt even close to and or the songs anything like 21. Its more a jazzy , louder version of Adele. I tried to play it twice and went back to 21 immediately. I was interested in the song \\" To make you feel my love\\" sung once by  -  who I love - Billy Joel and was even disapointed in her version of this song. Stick to ADELE 21.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a nice verity of games. me and my 6 yr old love playing them. it is a very addictive app.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I was surprised to see this set at such a low price. Ridley Scott's Science Fiction masterwork and possibly Harrison Ford's singular best acting job, four discs. and all three versions of the movie. The remastering is stunning, and makes it all the more stunning that \\"Blade Runner\\" was created before the CGI days.<br /><br />In the future, Androids are called replicants, but they also are smart and strong enough to go renegade. if they do, the Blade Runners shoot them down. Deckerd (Ford) is the best of the Blade Runners, and is called upon when an escaped group of Replicants returns to earth in search of immortality. Seems they have a built in 4 year expiration date. That is, except maybe for the one called Rachel, which Deckerd may be falling in love with. Played with smokey noir feminine wiles by Sean Young, she becomes the lynchpin in Deckerd's chase for the runaways.<br /><br />Noir is a major operative word here. Los Angeles in 2019 is covered in smoggy rainstorms and decaying buildings. Only the rich can afford to build themselves a place in the sun, and they're the ones making the killer bots. Which means everywhere else is darkness, shadows and slivers of light. This is easily one of the most exquisitely filmed Sci-Fi thrillers in history, which means the original cut didn't pass muster with the suits. That version (the happy ending voice-over version is included), along with the 1992 director's cut and the Ridley Scott final version. One of the few DVD's I've found fit to actually own, \\"Blade Runner\\" is a marvel of a movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this! lots of variety and fun to boot! not only to I play but my son loves the games as well.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is a story about the love of a family. It's a story about doing what's right, even if it kills you. It's a story about friendship and it's a story about betrayal. It's a story about war, and revolution, and death. It's a story about hope, and comfort, and life. It's even a love story, though you have to go through hell to get to the happily ever after. At its heart though, it's a story about a girl. An extraordinary girl who is brave, determined, fierce, smart, strong and loyal. It's a story about a girl who survived.    So much happens in the final book of the Hunger Games Trilogy. War has come to Panem and it seems like Katniss has no choice but to fight. Life in District 13 is regimented and uncertain. Katniss has her mother and sister, and Gale, but the loss of Peeta preys on her mind. What will his fate be in the hands of President Snow? When she is called to act, to don her Mockingjay suit and rally the people, can Katniss comply? How can she not?    As with all stories of epic proportions, there are many twists and turns to the plot. I have such a deep love and respect for this series, that I will not reveal them to you. These books were made to be enjoyed in solitude and unspoiled. If you haven't already read them, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!! You will be sucked in from Book 1, and Book 3 will leave you pondering the bigger questions in life for days to come.  Truly masterful writing.    ~Review by: Book Addict from When Pen Met Paper [...]
B0058VW36U|5.0|Its a way awesome game, for way awesome people!<br />I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH, but they should put a lock on the star key getting bought for young kids who play this. Great game, I'd like to see more games from. Zeptolab though.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|this was, without a doubt, the most disappointing movie i have ever seen. the actors were basically cardboard cutouts. everyone just stood around staring and whenever someone did talk, it was without emotion or purpose. it was like they filmed the practice reading and sent it in. bryan cranston was the only person on the screen who showed some emotion, he played his character excellently. him and the music was the only thing that kept me going until the credits rolled. to say this had a storyline with twists and turns is an exaggeration. yes there were violent parts, but seeing as how they were few and far between, they did nothing to help the movie pick up. i think the most depressing thing is i know that ryan gosling and ron perlman can perform better, but they were just plain terrible in this film.<br /><br />in conclusion, if you just have to see this movie, redbox it. don't waste a dollar on the bluray, hopefully they don't make another...but they will.

0545123275|5.0|Shiver brings an interesting new twist the werewolf mythos. Cold weather brings about the change into wolf form and warm weather allows the transformation back to human. This is what causes the story's central drama. Grace has watched the woods in her backyard for years. She knows the wolves who roam there, in particular a yellow-eyed one who seems to be watching her back. She feels a connection to it that her friends call obsession, but she doesn't know why. When a local teenage boy is ravaged and killed by wild animals, the adults take up arms to hunt down the wolf pack. Grace knows she cannot let this happen and goes to the woods to try and stop it. After being escorted home by an officer she finds a surprise waiting for her on the back porch: a naked, bleeding boy with yellow eyes.    Sam has been shot by the hunters, causing a shock back to human form. Finally he can get to know the girl he's loved for years. Sam stays in Grace's bedroom (her parents are kind of oblivious) and as long as they keep him warm, he will remain human. This poses a huge problem as the temperatures continue to drop.    A new werewolf has been turned and is showing up in human places. Sam needs to find it before something bad happens. There's also a she-wolf on the prowl who doesn't appreciate Grace's new closeness to Sam.    This book blew me away. It is chock full of emotion and drama. The scenes between Grace and Sam are heartbreakingly beautiful. Here is a boy who is struggling to stay a boy and a girl who wishes she could turn into a wolf to be with him. The characters are so real, so in love you forget that this is a young adult book - it feels like they've been together forever. The story is a roller coaster ride you feel is headed for impact and yet, you wouldn't get off the ride even if you could. There was a fluttery feeling of dread that persisted for the last few chapters because I just couldn't see how it would work out for these two but the ending was wonderful! I'm not going to give it away for those of you who have not read this story yet. (And why haven't you? Go get it!) But I will tell you Kleenex were needed after I finished. Isn't that a sign of a truly engaging story? Maggie Stiefvater does an incredible job of weaving love and sadness, joy and heartbreak together to make the spectacular tale that is Shiver.    ~Review by: Book Addict from When Pen Met Paper [...]

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|great productivity product. easy to use. versatile.  fun. good looking. love the elephant on the green back ground. worth purchasing.
B0070TLPUS|5.0|This series is the best.  Good storyline, good acting and overall a great adventure.  Excellent for kids but small ones may need some help with the villans.  Wonderful and creative story telling.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book and while I guess I enjoyed it some, I wasn't as impressed with it as much as it's impressed with itself.<br />The author spends so much time name-checking various geek/fanboy bits of popular culture it becomes an irritating distraction.  Reading the book is like sitting next to a friend of a friend at a bar and having him spend the evening trying to impress you by talking ceaselessly about every single song/movie/tv show/videogame he's ever enjoyed.  It gets tiresome quickly.<br /><br />(And if you're reading this review and thinking that this is a minor quibble, I assure you it is not.  The sheer volume of words devoted to the naming and description of the author's favorite pieces of pop/geek culture is staggering.  Buyer beware.)
0312641893|5.0|Just the cover of this book pulls you in and begs you to take a closer look. A leg in a red shoe with translucent stockings that show what appears to be metal parts? Very intriguing, indeed. Cinder is a fairytale re-telling like no other. Instead of an ill-treated maid of all work, Cinder is a brilliant mechanic and... a cyborg. When the Prince brings a broken android to her booth for repair, Cinder begins daydreaming of a different life.<br /><br />When her youngest stepsister and only human friend contracts the deadly plague that has been sweeping through the countryside, it's the last straw for Cinder's evil stepmother. As Cinder's guardian, she has the power to \\"volunteer\\" her for plague research. Cinder embarks on a twisted path that should lead to death but instead reveals many secrets from her past and encourages hopes for her future.<br /><br />Cinder is a marvel with all things mechanical, as well as intelligent, independent, ingenious and strong. Used to being cast in the role of 'freak' by everyone she meets, she is vulnerable and unsure of Prince Kai's attempts at friendship.<br /><br />Kai, the Prince who would be Emperor, seems lost and a bit alone. He is prepared to assume the mantle of responsibility, even if that means forfeiting his own happiness.<br /><br />If you;re like me, you guessed the big secret early on in the book but that doesn't mean it wasn't shocking when finally revealed in black and white. Of course I'm not going to reveal any of the secrets, but let's just say - there are some really good twists and turns! The ending left me both elated and frustrated, wishing the second book was already out for me to read. I'm not quite sure where Ms. Meyer is taking us, but I am happy to be along for the ride.<br /><br />Book 2 in the Lunar Chronicles, Scarlet, will be released sometime in 2013.<br /><br />~Review by: Book Addict from When Pen Met Paper [...]
B003UESJH4|5.0|Berte (Colin Firth) is crowned King George VI of England after his father (the king) dies and King Edward VIII's abdication,.  Berte has suffered from a serious speech impediment all of his life and is now suddenly thrust into the public's eye.  The country needs a strong leader as they are on the verge of going to war.  He is simply unable to speak to his country and provide the encouragement they need during these hard times.<br /><br />Berte's wife convinces him to go to a speech therapist and seek help with his affliction. What follows in one man's fight to overcome his personal handicap to become the leader his county so desperately needs.<br /><br />From the time I could talk until I was finishing college I suffered with a terrible speech impediment.  It is a real burden to live with and luckily I was able to overcome it.  I related to this story in the first person and found it to be inspirational.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it to you to see!
B001LXIDVS|3.0|As a whole, the Back to the Future movies are just awesome. The first Back to the Future is probably one of the best movies ever created. I have a hard time imagining that anyone would dislike the plot. The second of the movie is better. It goes to the future and even gives a nice spin on the original movie.<br /><br />The third one I think is a bit off. I like the idea of the wild west. I believe in several parts of the original, Doc mentioned that his favorite era in time is the wild west. By the end of Back to the Future part 2, Doc went back to his favorite era by a freak lightning accident. Doc wrote Marty a letter that explains the issue and that he stored the car in an abandoned mine with instructions on how to rebuild a missing part of the time machine so he can get back to the year 1985. Marty then finds out that Doc actually dies and Marty decides to travel back to save Doc from being murdered. Marty travels back and the fuel tanks gets a hole which causes the vehicle to be disabled.<br /><br />So with that in mind, this is where the movie begins to fail. While Marty and Doc were discussing ideas, I was actually pounding my head on the table saying, \\"If all they need is gas, then couldn't they simply use the gas from the time machine that Doc stored in the mine?\\" If Doc stored the time machine, and Marty came back with it, then the time machine that Doc stored would still be in the mine. And he could have easily re-written the letter to include instructions to put in gas. Plus in Back to the Future 2, it is suggested that Doc made some upgrades to the car to include alternative fuel. Some odd reason Doc it also runs on gas. So I'm a bit confused there as well.<br /><br />So this baffled me and instead the entire movie made into a bizarre attempt to get the car up to 88 miles per hour and then a love story. For this, I felt the movie was the weakest and most certainly a bad ending to an otherwise good series.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I liked it better prior to &quot;update&quot;.  Have to download everytime I get on when using my kindle fire.  Please fix.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Great show. A nice mix of drama and humor. Good acting and very well cast. Individual stories are good and the continuing story makes it difficult to stop watching. The judges are particularly witty and unique. A couple characters are over the top but I suppose that's necessary to keep things light. It's fun because it gets into politics a little but doesn't do it in a way that angers either side. Can't wait to start on season 2.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins exploits the ultimate battle between the classes in this intense novel.<br /><br />When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen's twelve-year-old sister is chosen for the Hunger Games, she steps forward to take her place. Thrown together with the sweet boy who'd once given her bread, Katniss must find a way to survive against twenty-three other competitors. Because in the Hunger Games, there is only one victor. To lose, means death.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is a fast-paced read. Collins' greatest talent with this book is the underlying tension throughout. As a reader, I had to keep turning page after page to find out what would happen. The plot reminds me of the Athenian tributes to Crete in Greek mythology. Katniss is such a strong, hard character with a glimpse of a softer side. Peeta's love for her is endearing. I loved the use of Roman and Greek myths and motifs throughout. The world building is brilliant with the take on a futuristic American (a.k.a. Panem) as well as the interesting creatures, such as the mocking-jay. This novel is one-part social commentary, one-part reality TV show-ish, and one part love story.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' THE HUNGER GAMES is an intense read, and I can't wait to read books two and three. May the odds be forever in Suzanne Collins' favor.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like this Bible app, but wish I could highlight and take notes without an Internet connection. You have to download the versions you wish to use to your device for offline viewing which takes up memory space. You also cannot follow the plans or devotionals offline. so, its great if you're constantly connected to the Internet, but if not, you cant do much with it.
1400069289|5.0|It's incredibly difficult to write about thorny, complicated realities and do it in a way that's engaging and enjoyable to read. It's also hard to write something that makes you think about your life in a different way. Duhigg accomplishes all three in this excellent book. If you're a fan of books like Jonah Lehrer's \\"How We Decide,\\" I'd definitely recommend checking this out.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have been using this app for several weeks. It seems to take a while to &quot;locate&quot; me each time I open it but once that is done the data is well presented and pretty up to date.  I would recommend this app to android users.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll admit, I bought this at least in part because it was inexpensive and I was curious based on the reviews.  Honestly, it's underpriced for how good it is.  I'm always impressed when an author can create such a detailed and well planned out world for his characters and stories - the world of Wool is chilling from the beginning, and only gets more so as the layers of history are peeled back through the series of stories.  The reader is not spoon-fed anything.  You pretty much learn things as the characters learn them, and frankly there were a couple of times where I was actually caught completely off guard by the twists.  If you don't want to get all five in the series at once, start with the first.  It's short, and if it doesn't grab you by the end, then you're not a fan good stories.  They're by no means perfect, but few books are, and the pacing and the creativity in the stories more than offsets some of the small things that a good editor may have cleaned up.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent series of books - well worth it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down. I would take this book everywhere so I keep reading it. I have read the series 8 times and counting. If you would like a good book to read, this should be at the top of your list!
B0035G04TI|5.0|I expected this would be a dull book about relationships that didn't have any substance, but was pleasantly surprised to find that is was a practical, easy to read book that I actually enjoyed.<br /><br />Your love language is the way that you feel most loved and cared for.<br />Most people love how they want to be loved, and this usually doesn't align with how their partner wants to be loved. The key concept is that there are 5 love languages, everybody has a primary language, and by targeting the primary love language of your partner you will fill their emotional love tank and strengthen your relationship.<br />- Words of Affirmation<br />- Quality Time<br />- Receiving Gifts<br />- Acts of Service<br />- Physical Touch<br /><br />Guidance is provided to work out what your primary love language is. There are some religious references and quotes, but they were infrequent enough that I found that it did not detract from the key contents.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|It covers a lot of things that are very basic when it comes to communicating, things that you can kind of Google and look up online.<br /><br />Some of the conversation starters are a bit outrageous, it's like who would really ask a question like that to start a conversation? Questions like: Who is the most interesting person you met?; What has been the most life changing experience you ever had?; Who's had the the most influence on your life? I can't imagine you actually asking these questions to a person you just met, you would probably have to paraphrase them if you do try.<br /><br />The only notable advice it gives is to like everyone unless they give you reason not to, that way you can connect to them more. Also, it's okay to NOT have a perfect conversation each time; each experience eventually becomes better than the next.<br /><br />Overall, if you haven't read a book about conversation at all, this would be a okay book to start with. If you are looking for something more advanced, this book doesn't provide new insight - it would just confirm the things you know already. But I think if you are looking for a book to build better rapport with people, a better place to start are books by Nicholas Boothman.  One of my favorite is [[ASIN:B003Y5IMT4 How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less]] > which teaches you how to communicate and connect with someone you just met, and to really just be yourself.

006197806X|4.0|PANDEMONIUM continues immediately after the ending of DELIRIUM. Lena is running away from the border after seeing her love Alex killed. She is half dead herself before she is found by a group of Invalids in the wild.<br /><br />The first quarter of the book was a bit depressing as Lena mourns and lets herself sorta waste away. She finally kicks herself into gear and gets back to her strong self. She of course is strongly against the cure and is now fighting on the side of the Invalids. The story flowed well. It jumps back and forth between Lena's time in the wild in the past and the present day events she is currently going through. I liked all the explanations of the wild and how everything worked around \\"camp\\". I enjoyed most of the new characters. The newest love interest kinda annoyed me. I know that Lena needs to move on with her life but I had a hard time seeing the romantic connection between her and Julian. They went through some tough things together but they didn't click with me. If she had to have a new love interest at all I would have liked to see her with someone from the wild. That is the only thing I didn't like about the story.<br /><br />I sorta saw the ending coming but still enjoyed it all the same, it will definitely shake things up. Everything was just going too good for something major not to happen. It is a bit of a cliffhanger though so be prepared to be left with your mouth open and mind racing. REQUIEM will be out in 2013.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I must admit I was reluctant to read this series as I could not see myself interested in a book about children killing each other. However from the first pages I was hooked. The books are more about survival than about dying. The first 2 of the trilogy are excellant and the last one is a bit weak however all in all it was worth my time and money.

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I love this game. Simple and elegant but enough there to keep you playing. It should have something saying what the upgrades do though.  Thanks for the flashback!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Pros: wireless, physical build quality, and most of all \\"surround sound\\", which alone sets itself apart from every other headphones out there.<br /><br />Cons: it's cool but, not too impressed by it. it does produce a \\"perception\\" of surround sound field, however the end result simulated sound still feels shallow and lack in depth and distance. it's almost like having all 7 speakers taped right to your ears without the natural sound effect of distance, space and attenuation (which are all essential elements in surround sound effects). sometimes it's hard to tell surround side from surround rear. surround rear also does not sound true from the rear, but rather more from the side, which farther mixes the effects of surround side. it's a cool little piece of toy that's definitely better than your average headphone, however, for serious home theater, or audiophiles this will never replace the real thing. not to mention due to the wireless bandwidth capacity, it can only transmit up to 16bit 48khz.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: be sure to set the output level in the logitech G930 control panel from default of +11 down to +10 or +9. the default value of +11 is too high and causes the bass to clip. i have a very elaborate surround sound home theater system at home. and i was hoping more out of this G930 (to be a night time gaming alternative for the study room). i was however not WOWed by it. at least not enough to pay the full retail price tag. if you have a very elaborate surround sound home theater system at home already, this will not replace it, or come anywhere close.

1451627289|4.0|I've read maybe a half dozen Stephen King novels and his books have always been hit or miss with me.  I didn't like [[ASIN:0307743683 The Stand]] or [[ASIN:0452284694 The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)]] (books which everyone else loves), but [[ASIN:0451196716 The Long Walk]] has been one of my favorite stories. I think he is an excellent writer, but the supernatural stories have never really hooked me. So it was with a bit of trepidation that I approached 11/22/63, even though the subject matter seemed to be a better fit for me.<br /><br />35-year old Jake Epping discovers a time portal in 2011, that allows him to travel back to 1958, which he uses in an attempt to stop the John F. Kennedy assassination. Not having lived during this event, the significance of this act was initially lost on me. Although it was never really made clear to me, King seems to be supporting the idea that JFK's survival would have prevented the heavy casualties resulting from the Vietnam War.<br /><br />I've read dozens of time travel novels, and one problem that many of them share is that they can get too convoluted when dealing with the science behind it.  Multiple paradoxes and issues with causality are introduced, that just muddle the story and make it difficult to suspend disbelief for readers like me who are always over analyzing how they explain time travel is possible.  King wisely avoids this by producing a time travel portal that is \\"just there.\\" No real explanation for how it came to be or why it exists to get in the way of the story.  The reader is given some insight into the \\"rules\\" governing it, but for the most part, all of this takes place in the background to the main action - Jake's quest to stop Oswald.  King also provides a love interest for Jake in the form of Sadie, who figures prominently in the story. While I normally feel that King does an excellent job with character development, I never really bought into Jake's love for Sadie and it always felt a bit forced. At times, her character annoyed me and I just wanted to skip through her dialog (and problems). Even with my lack of emotional investment in Sadie, she does provide additional conflict for the story and is a necessary tool to further the action.  After all, you can't have 850 pages of Jake following Oswald around for several years until November 22nd.<br /><br />I am not a student of the JFK assassination, but it is clear that this book is exhaustively well-researched.  This has allowed King to create fictional characters based on real people and events, that would likely closely mirror their real counterparts.  It was difficult to separate what events in the story actually occurred, and which are creative license.  Even at this book's length, King keeps the plot moving fairly quickly and I never found myself bored with it or trying to slug through chapters just to get to something more interesting.  It is definitely a different type of novel than King's fans may be used to from this author, but one that I think that most who pick it up will be content with..

B0067LXQAW|2.0|Came into this release with an open mind, but fairly disappointed. Sure, still the same distinctive sound of the Cranberries, and well performed. Dolores' vocals are decent enough, but the songwriting is just not there. Fans of the last 2 or 3 Cranberries albums and even Dolores' last solo album will probably enjoy this release, but fans of the first 2 Cranberries albums - look elsewhere.

B0038W0OHQ|1.0|I got this headphones after reading the reviews about the sound cutting out when you stretch the headband over a period of time thinking that my head is not that big, it should not be an issue. I used these headphones for about 2 weeks over the holidays before the sound in the right ear started cutting out. It get it to reconnect I had to really smash the cups onto my head which bent the headband back into place. I contacted their technical support and all they did was send me a new cable. After looking more closely at what movements caused the sound to cut out, i returned this item to amazon before the replacement cable even arrived. These headphones suffer from a terrible design flaw and are not suitable for any application beyond expensive earmuffs.<br /><br />NO NOT BUY<br /><br />For about the same price you can have an Audio Technica ATH-M50 and a Zalman clip on Mic; both of which are significantly higher quality.

0316098329|5.0|We've probably all heard stories about some girl who gets locked up by a creep in a basement or something similar and gets held against her will for years.  In Germany there was a case where a girl was held for something like 19 years I think.<br /><br />\\"Room\\" involves the story of one such woman.  Except it's not really about her ordeal.  Instead the story is told through her five-year-old son Jack who was born in captivity two years after the woman he only calls Ma was snatched off the street.<br /><br />Because he knows nothing else, everything that's happening is normal to Jack.  Ma tells him that where they live (Room) is the only real thing in the world and everything the TV shows is make-believe.  So he never questions what's going on; to him there is no outside world.<br /><br />The first half of the book deals with Jack and Ma's daily routines for the most part.  A lot of these are pretty normal--eating, exercising, doing laundry--and some like \\"Old Nick\\" visiting in the night are not normal to us but normal to Jack.<br /><br />The second half of the book deals with Ma and Jack finally emerging from Room and having to adjust to the outside world.<br /><br />I thought most of this novel was brilliant.  Jack might not sound like a \\"normal\\" five-year-old, but as we learn he's not normal.  He has a higher-than-average vocabulary and can read.  The way he describes some things like \\"wanting some\\" and the squeaks of the bed when Old Nick visits Ma in the night cloak a lot of the gory details about their captivity.<br /><br />What bugged me at the end though was that the ending itself fell a little flat.  I kept feeling like the story was building to something, but when it was over at the 94% mark it seemed more as if it had fizzled.  Really the dramatic climax is somewhere around 50% into the book and so when you look back the remaining 45% was mostly a lot of details that weren't really going anywhere except to show Jack swapping Room for the much larger Room of the world.<br /><br />Still this was a real page-turner, or screen-turner since I read it on the Kindle.  I'd highly recommend it so much as you're not like some readers and such a coward that the very idea of this book frightens you into giving it one star.<br /><br />That is all.f the world.<br /><br />Still this was a real page-turner, or screen-turner since I read it on the Kindle.

006197806X|5.0|I loved the first book in the series, Delirium. The end left me bawling and wanting more. Pandemonium was one of the books I was looking forward to most in 2012. Needless to say, it did not disappoint at all. I fell in love with again with the old characters, and fell in love for the first time with some new characters. At first, I didn't like Julian because I was a Team Alex person, but as the story progressed I began to like him more and more. There were a couple character deaths with new characters that left me quite sad, but I understand why the author had to do it. I missed Hana quite a bit in this book. I was a little confused in the beginning because it starts with her being in a school, and then goes back to her time spent in the Wilds. If you stick with the book, the hopping and skipping from now to then will start to make a lot of sense and is a unique way to write the story. I applaud Lauren Oliver for writing it that way, especially after Ally Condie tried to write Crossed, another hit dystopian novel, in the same way and it turned out as a flop for most fans. Oliver definitely succeeded with it though. Lena grows from a weak girl to a strong, smart, courageous woman in between her first week in the Wilds and the end of Pandemonium. The ending had me freaking out. I didn't know whether I wanted to laugh, cry, or throw my book at a wall. I need to read the next book NOW. This book is definitely worth checking out, but make sure you read Delirium first or it won't make much sense. I can't wait to read the third book in the series, Requiem, and find out what happens next.
B004EPZ0AM|4.0|three and a half stars<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by all the bad reviews (i equate the bad reviews to trolling)...adults reviewing a kids movie. It's pretty comical that their personal taste goes into a review for a movie for kids. The movie was somewhat well received by critics from what I read. Adults need to check in their expectations for a movie and realize that it's target audience are probably pre-school to elementary kids, NOT ADULTS!!!!<br /><br />Most sequels are not as good as the first (unless you're pixar & KungFu Panda 2) but overall it was an enjoyable movie. My daughters love it, they sing along and dance to it. The Krills do seem disconnected from the overall plot (existentialism in a kids movie?!? a bit over the top). Bill and Will are comic relief and could have been an entire separate plot to itself. The animation is eye-popping, the songs are fun, the baby penguins are cute. But the main fact is kids will enjoy it.

Simon is thrown into jail and Clary is separated from everyone except for Luke and must find her own way to Alicante. Once she's finally in the city, she finds Jace doesn't want her in the city. There she meets Sebastion another Shadowhunter who has a dark and terrible secret.<br /><br />I think Clary is the perfect heroine and has come into her own by the end of the book. She's not too harsh, not too soft. No matter how afraid, she would do anything to save her family and friends.<br /><br />Jace as always is the epitome of tortured hero. His character is darker in this book but he is still a good guy underneath it all.<br /><br />The story is full of twists, one huge one in the form of Sebastian!<br />City of Glass has everything you would want in a book and for me has the perfect ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It says something when a slower reader, like myself, can finish this book in a week. I truely believe this book will be seen as a classic.

0307477479|4.0|It probably helps to enjoy short stories to really enjoy Good Squad - luckily I do. Characters are only loosely affiliated with each other as they enter and exit from each other's stories, but I enjoyed them all and it came across as heartfelt rather than a gimmick. There's not a lot revealed within each character's lives and motivations as they interact, but the writing is crisp and the stories paced really well.<br /><br />Egan gets away with the fantastical such as a bloody mishap on a safari and a PR coup involving a movie star and a dictator. OK, a bit silly, but it works, just as it works for Jonathan Franzen who also manages to mix the kitchen sink of domestic life with the odd incursion into a life less ordinary.
0143119680|4.0|Discovery of Witches follows Diana, a young American scholar and witch who is researching alchemy in England. During her studies she comes across a mysterious document, the discovery has supernatural creatures (Witches, Vampires and Daemons) interested in whom Diana is. Especially Matthew, a very old French vampire who has motives and secrets of his own.<br /><br />I have to say Deborah Harkness does a great job in describing and transporting the reader into the Bodleian library. It was if I could smell old manuscripts, with her detailed descriptions.<br /><br />I've heard of this book being described as Twilight for adults. I've got to say this book has a whole lot more going on than just a vampire-witch romance.<br /><br />I had so many questions when I had finished. The ending of the book leaves no doubt there will be a sequel. Absolutely can't wait!<br /><br />Must read for any Paranormal Addict!

B002ZG983M|5.0|This movie was great. I want to watch it again real soon. It seemed made more for adults than for children with it's dark entertaining side and that is why I think I took to it. It makes you want to be a superhero too.
1594202842|1.0|I won't go into much about this book; I don't think it deserves it!<br /><br />I find Amy Chua to be smug and cold. You are able to raise a child to excel in life without taking away their childhood and all of the great experiences that come with it.<br /><br />The fact that she believes her parenting style so superior, is why she doesn't see that she has in fact FAILED her children in many ways.<br /><br />Now do not get me wrong Amy Chua is not a bad parent, there are many bad parents out there and she isn't one of them. I just dislike the way she parents. You may turn red with anger at some of the things she does, but you will agree that Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is an interesting read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games r harder to maneaver than others<br /> it takes<br /> a lot of time to get the hang of these games.
B006S053K8|3.0|My expectations going into this film were average and that is this film was--average.  The characters seemed somewhat immature for the college-ages they were supposed to be.  I also found the parent/child relationships poorly developed.<br /><br />I have seen several films with Kristen Stewart and she does a good job portraying conflicted young women. I will be interested to see how she transitions to playing more mature female characters in the future.<br /><br />The one exception to the averageness of this film is Bill Hader's scene with the baseball bat--a classic!

0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is so much different than anything else on the market.  It was fast paced, fun, witty, gruesome, and exciting.  I reccomend it to everyone.  It's just too bad she couldn't maintain the intensity for all three books.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I did enjoy this game. I spent time playing it when I should have been doing something more constructive, but it held my attention and most of the puzzles weren't TOO easy. Well, for the most part anyway. It was way to short though. A couple of hours and done.

0439023513|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the series.  This book however was different.  It felt kind of forced and the story took some completely different turns.  I guess the most frustrating part was that this book had the most potential.  However, this book flopped miserably.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It is about fatherhood and has religious overtones. This movie will make you cry. It brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend this movie.

0156027321|5.0|(I start this review with the statement that I can not spell and unfortunatly do not know how to use spell check either I am sorry for all the mispelled words)<br />  I have just finished this book, that I could litarly not put down. I do not pretend to be the smartest or the most spiritual person that has reviewed this book.I read three reviews before deciding to write my own. All three had very different opinions of the book, here is another.<br />  The promise of a story that would make me believe in God was exciting.I have generaly believed in God all my life(52Years)  with short periods of dought. I never read books that are violent or gross. This book is both in a lot of places, but the promise and great writting kept me reading.I read the story told by Pi as fact-even telling my nutritionalist that i felt so sorry for Pi to be raised a vegatarion to be forced to become a carnivor. I read excerpts to my legally blind husband- telling him that it was a true story. As the story went by I began to wonder when the \\"believeing in God\\" part was going to start. I began to feel disapointed thinking that it would not happen. Then I began to dought the story altogether....But then at the very end not only did I understand the story but the promose was kept!<br />  (Spoiler alert)All my life I have  wondered about why the Bible was made up of story after story some believable and some kind of far fetched. Thanks to this book I finally get it! IT DOES NOT MATTER wether the stories are history or parables it is the message, not the story.  I certainly would not have read the story \\"without the animals\\". Another thing I have wondered about  is why there are so many religons around the earth. Again the answer is given in this book, IT DOES NOT MATTER there is only one God.
0439023491|5.0|This book rivals the first in the series in entertainment and quaility.  This is a first person narrative and the fast paced action is easy to get addicted to.  The world is futuristic and different from anything else out there.  A great read.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Fantastic video that shows Whitney when she had no equal.  If you only get one Whitney Houston video, this is the one to get.  In addition to all the MTV video hits, included on the DVD are the Star Spangle Banner and my favorite, the song she originally sang for the opening ceremonies of the Olympics \\"One Moment in Time\\".
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is just great!!! It is easy to use, intuitive, and useful. Since the last update, I have no complaints, just good things to say!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I cannot find a flaw with this alarm clock, nor can I think of the feature that is missing. It is amazing, worth every penny, is light years ahead of the stock android alarm clock and I absolutely love how the alarm volume can be set to steadily get louder and louder and louder when an alarm goes off.  I guess if I had to ask for one more feature I would ask for more widgets. Or maybe even user-made skins support. Then things would get very interesting with this program. Users could contribute their own skins. How awesome would that be?
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love the fact that I can stack sounds and save the results to my favorites. this is one great app. the only thing they need now is more sounds, I'd pay.
B00005CDNI|5.0|This is a great German made re-master of ABBA's 1979 album \\"VOULEZ VOUS\\". The sound quality on this particular re-master is brilliant and the album sounds as fresh and vibrant today as it did 33 years ago upon its initial release.<br /><br />The aforementioned \\"VOULEZ VOUS\\" was Abba's sixth studio album and took more then a year to complete. There was a two year gap between Abba's previous studio album titled \\"THE ALBUM\\", released in 1977, and \\"VOULEZ VOUS\\". This was unusual for Abba, who up until that point, were steadily releasing a new studio album every year. But this time the group took their time with the latest release and the majority of \\"VOULEZ VOUS\\" was aimed at the dance floor. After all, most of the album was recorded in 1978 and Disco music was the sound that dominated the world at the time. Once Abba dedicated them self to a certain sound, they perfected it and made it their own. The title track, along with \\"ANGEL EYES\\" and \\"DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW\\" all became sizable chart hits around the world and became favorites at Discos. However, Abba's talents were not only limited to upbeat dance songs. \\"I HAVE A DREAM\\" and \\"CHIQUITITA\\" are gorgeous ballads which also became hits. The female lead vocalists, Agnetha and Frida, are both in excellent vocal form here as their voices soar, especially when they sing together. Their vocal prowess is particularly evident on \\"CHIQUITITA\\" as their combined voices soar to a spine tingling crescendo.<br /><br />This is a great treat for CD/ABBA collectors. This re-master contains the original album artwork, both front and back, along with beautiful alternate cover shots for the album inside the booklet. The booklet also has interesting liner notes and the lyrics are there as well. The packaging itself is also great. However, the best part of this re-master is the addition of three Bonus tracks originally recorded for \\"VOULEZ VOUS\\" but not initially included on the album release. \\"GIMMIE GIMMIE GIMMIE(A MAN AFTER MIDNIGHT), a booming Disco Rocker which bears a striking resemblance to Donna Summer's \\"HOT STUFF\\" became a huge worldwide hit for Abba but it was previously only available on their Greatest Hits compilation. Same story with another bonus track included here, \\"SUMMER NIGHT CITY\\", a great dance song with rock overtones. The final bonus track, \\"LOVELIGHT\\" is a real treat for Abba fans since this was a previously unreleased track, which is now available on CD for the first time.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great album to have on CD. For Abba fans in particular, I would say this is a real find.booming Disco Rocker which bears a striking resemblance to Donna Summer's \\"HOT STUFF\\" became a huge worldwide hit for Abba but it was previously only available on their Greatest Hits compilation.

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|a very fun game and great time waster graphics are cool and humorous story line no lag and just a fun game to have on your kindle
0525423656|3.0|The two main characters are Ky and Cassia. Ky is one of my favorite characters. He is very brave and strong in my opinion. Cassia is a strong and independent girl who would do anything to find her love Ky. The setting in mainly based in the carving. The carving is like a canyon with caves and rivers everywhere. I think this book is based a little in the future.<br /> This book is about the future where \\"The Society\\" rules. \\"The Society\\" chooses everything for you, what you eat, who you will marry, and controls your life. Cassia was just a normal girl living in \\"The Society\\". But after her true love Ky was transported to a aberration camp her life changes. Now her life is based on trying to find Ky and getting away from \\"The Society\\" to join the Rising. The Rising is a rebellion against \\"The Society\\". On the adventure Cassia and Ky find some friends on the way. I thought this book was okay. At times I couldn't understand what people were talking about or even who was talking. To understand this book you will need to read the first book, Matched. I think this book has a little romance with a touch of future fantasy.
0439023491|5.0|I really enjoyed the series and I wish there were more to the story.  Collins draws the reader in to the story to make you feel as if you know the characters.  I found myself not wanting to put the book down.
B00000IREA|5.0|There are those timeless Campy movies. This is one of them. This is also the king of Girl campy. I.E. Girls like it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was amazing and really pulls you in. I loved the twists and turns and I personally love endings that leave you hanging, but promise another book. First off, Leo was just AWESOME! I really enjoyed his humor and sarcasm, most likely because I am very sarcastic as well. He was a showstealer and I wish there was more of him. Piper was less exciting, and the romance was kind of dissapointing, but she was still pretty likeable. Her charmspeaking did intrest me though. Jason was a to the que hero, a little predictable seeimg as he's always saving everyone. Kind of like Percy...<br />  All in all, it was seriously my fav. book by Riordan and I look forward to the sequel.
B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and she watches it all the time.  Glad I was able to finally purchase the movie.  I'll be highly upset if the price goes down on the movie.

B0052RE4MQ|2.0|I finished Matched eagerly awaiting the sequel, but  have to say, not much happened. Ky and his girl are reunited, bla bla bla, and they find the resistance. Seriously, thats it!!! Ove the author, but I hope that there is another, better, more exciting book.<br />I couldn't put Matched down, while this took me two months to read, which is really saying something. That's a long time for a 4th grader, even, and I'm in 9th grade! Do yourself a favor and just wait for the third book.
B0000025D0|5.0|If you are a sentient being and have not heard this record, you must do so immediately. Everything great about rock and roll and folk/rock is on this record. The E Street Band is superb. The songs are filled with deep feeling, meaningful observations, memorable phrases and images. The factory workers going through the gates in the rain \\"with death in their eyes.\\" And I've never heard anybody, anywhere at anytime sing more passionate and harrowing vocals than The Boss on this record, howling like a wounded animal at times. Then through the all the darkness comes the light, \\"The Promised Land\\", and if you're not singing along or pounding the dashboard at this point, you're dead. Just brilliant, the real stuff.

B001L5SXQG|2.0|A CD that you have to be over 50, materially comfortable, and on Ecstasy to enjoy. There's a few solid Bruce type moments on this recording, mainly the ones that don't utilize an orchestra and a chorus on them. I'm a Bruce minimalist. His greatest music is always stripped down rock and roll, blues, and folk. \\"Lucky Day\\", \\"Blind Eye\\",\\"The Wrestler\\" I can relate to. The title track, \\"Working on A Dream\\" gets your hopes up and then turns out to be bland and pointless. And the rest, unfortunately, sounds something like boomer Muzak. I must add that the great drummer, Max Weinberg, is wasted here and might as well be a drum machine on this sweet and gooey mess. Why bother to employ Nils Lofgren if he doesn't get solos? Not what you would wish for as a send off for Danny.
006197806X|5.0|I am in LOVE! Seriously! I feel like I am in love! I went to bed thinking about Pandemonium and I woke up thinking about it as well! I can't seem to get it off my mind! I know I love a book once I'm done with it when I replay scenes over and over again in my mind!<br /><br />We all know, well at least those of us who read Delirium, how it ended. That ending broke thousands of hearts. I was kind of shattered. In Pandemonium, we see Lena's struggles in the Wilds and see how she moves past the tragedy that is Alex. I had my heart shattered all over again within the first few pages. The hurt and grief for Lena is still very, very knew at that point, so I was tearing up and aching for her at the same moments.<br /><br />Pandemonium is told in alternating then and now chapters...it's done VERY well. It didn't bother me one bit. I found myself at the beginning of the book, reading the NOW chapters fast because I really wanted to read the THEN chapters. As the story went on, I found myself reading the THEN chapters fast because all of the really good stuff was in the NOW chapters.  I'm surprised I enjoyed the chapters like this.<br /><br />I only read one review of this book before I read it. I kind of wanted to go into this book without having read too many reviews.  This one reviewer stated that she couldn't believe she was able to fall in love with another boy after Alex. I can't believe I was able to as well. Just WOW.<br /><br />The last 80 pages for me were difficult to read. Not because I thought the story was bad, but because I didn't want the book to end and I was totally afraid of what was going to happen. I will admit. I guessed the ending of this book...well one part at least.  Did I find the ending predictable? Yes, obviously. I still couldn't believe it happened after it happened though. Even though I just KNEW it was coming I still was shocked and thrown off guard. I NEED to get my hands on Requiem as soon as I am able to! I'm already jonsen for more of this beautiful world and the characters Lauren Oliver has created!beautiful world and the characters Lauren Oliver has created!
B004EPZ00M|5.0|I actually nearly fell out of my cinema seat from laughing at the 'conference chair' scene. I think I embarrassed myself but my husband was actually SNORTING with laughter - (which I had never heard before) so I was slightly less embarrassing. I never did really like Mr Bean or Black Adder so was doubtful that I would like the first Johnny English film but it just made me laugh so much and this latest one made me laugh even more.  I strongly recommend it.  Really good fun. And very much a family film.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|I don't like showing people the trailers for this movie because I feel it gives away too much.  Movie was hilarious!  The casting is brilliant.  My husband and I are horror fans, and this had us ROFL.  The scene where Dale asks the kids if they're going camping, my husband almost wet himself describing it, he was laughing so hard.  I am a personal fan of Alan Tudyk (Tucker).  He was Wash in Firefly. He was Steve the Pirate in Dodgeball.  The guy is brilliant.  This movie has the best \\"camp\\" and gore and WTF moments. Great entertainment value.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Everything worked as advertised, except the thing added a loud hum to the audio---which was, of course, a deal-breaker. I had to return it. You should expect to hear a little tape noise, but not an annoying hum. During loud passages in the music the hum was covered. But during softer sections and in between songs the humming was unbearable.<br /><br />On the other hand, maybe I just got a lemon. Yours might work fine.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I experienced both Ico and Colossus for the first time in this PS3 collection.  I've never seen anything like either game, in terms of atmosphere, style, and plot.  Both titles feature mysterious plots with ambiguous resolutions.  Ico is haunting, containing memorable images such as the shadowy creatures pulling a  willowy girl in white into an abyss.  For a game published in 2001, it was quite revolutionary, and I see that it was an inspiration for many of my favorite games, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time series.  Colossus is remarkable for the physics of the Colossi, in which you must maneuver a living, moving, obstacle course.<br /><br />I'd consider Colossus to be one of the greatest games of all time, but those maddening controls!  I forgive the clunky gameplay of Ico, the game was ahead of its time, and in 2001, there was not a huge number of third-person 3D games of its kind.  Shadow of the Colossus, on the other hand, commits numerous huge sins in the gameplay department.  I'm sorry, but the controls are simply awful, and yes, I've played through and defeated all 16 colossi numerous times, so I don't think I'm missing anything.  I've also played quite a few third-person 3D games (it's my favorite genre) so I don't think I'm in the wrong here. The game's beauty and awe inspiring fights keep bringing me back to it, but the poor controls keeps tearing me away.  I've never had such a dysfunctional relationship with a video game!  The horse is a huge pain to navigate, and Wander's jumping direction can be had to predict at times.  So many of my best moves were more dumb luck than strategy.  Several of the colossi stun you for an inordinate amount of time, and simply stun you again before you have a chance to recover.  If the game designers wanted to make this fatal, then please kill me on the first charge!  Why force me to sit there if I have a huge amount of health, watching it whittle away, powerless to break the cycle?  Oh, and the camera control can be downright awful.  It's so maddening that such an amazing game is damaged by several glaring control flaws that were absent in many of its lesser 2005 era peers.  These bizarre shortcomings in gameplay are truly the glowing weak spot on an otherwise flawless colossus of a game.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I love Mahjong games and I got this one for my Kindle Fire and my Samsung Stratosphere. I have not played it in the cell yet so I am not sure how clear it will be on the smaller screen.<br /><br />The game is not too bad, but it isn't the absolute best I have for Kindle Fire that is why I gave it an average of 3 stars. Two of the best are Artifacts and 1 and 2.<br /><br />For the price of 99 cents it will help kill time while waiting and waiting and waiting :)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I pre-ordered this book (Kindle edition) just because I thought the cover looked interesting. Silly, I know. I have to say though, I am so glad I did!  I don't know that I have ever enjoyed a book as much as I did this one.<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect from The Night Circus, this was before all the hype over it, and I was skeptical.  But after the first few pages I was intrigued, I couldn't put it down. In fact, I didn't want to put it down, I wanted to climb in and become a part of this story! As I raved about it to pretty much everyone I know, they all asked, \\"What's it about? What's so good about it?\\" I tried to explain the story but wasn't doing it the justice it deserves, so I just told them, \\"It's magical.\\"  And it is.<br /><br />I have since decided it's not necessarily the story that makes this book so fantastic, it's the feeling. Erin Morgenstern really did a superb job playing on my sense of intrigue and my childish belief in magic and mystery and romance.  The circus and its inhabitants came to life in my mind. I often felt as if I was in The Night Circus. It made me happy, it engrossed me with a sense of wonder. I never wanted to leave, and I long for more. Every book I have read since has been a disappointment as they lack the same enchanting qualities.<br /><br />After I read the Kindle version I went out and bought the hardcover. I wanted to see the cover and feel the pages on my fingertips as if that would some how make it all real. It will be a story that I continue to read over and over with the same enjoyment.  Thank you Erin Morgenstern.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Listened to the cd for a couple weeks now, love 90% of the songs on the cd. No lyrics in the cd, the case comes with a booklet with several photos of crappy old vans, which to me is awesome. I love their humor and their style of music. I recommend watching the music video for \\"Lonely Boy\\". So many artists try to be artistic or fancy, they have a random guy dancing for the entire video, pure genius.
B005K17RU0|5.0|simple. intuitive and beautifully designed. i love it. I check it daily before I go out into the world. its awesome.
1594203334|3.0|The book is entertaining enough- part anthropology, part Sex and the City- and brings up some relevant and interesting points about Americans' child-rearing habits.  However the audio book is truly painful to listen to because the narrator tries to add an accent to each of the French characters in the story.  She does not do a good job with accents, and it's distracting because it's so forced.  Probably best to go for the paperback.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played it a lot. I like the features for making it look the way you want it to!
B001UGB1X8|1.0|I agree with the other reviewers. This film had all the potential in the world: great cast, incredible story, lots of atmosphere to tap into. But, in the end, it was truly disappointing. I love James Lee Burke - he's an American Treasure and this book rocked. But, the movie disappointed me. Can't recommend it.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I finally read this book after many of my friends recommended it. I did not enjoy this book. I found it too confusing, and in the end a bit preachy. I think the author had a good idea, but lost the heart of the story by not developing the characters' emotions enough. And skipping back and forth in time by 2 months here, a decade there, adds to the confusion.

0812992792|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is the most wholly original, profoundly moving epic I've come across in years. It's been a month since I originally read this compelling novel, yet the characters and events continue to bounce around in my head. Though the fascinating setting and surprising turns of plot are engrossing, these elements take a backseat to what is, at its heart, a very human story. Structurally, chapter by chapter, and at the sentence level, Adam Johnson is a consumate craftsman, a writer at the height of his game.

B0075564A8|5.0|The documentary came out in the early 90's and is still the #1 most successful documentary of all time.  When it hit theaters no one had ever seen anything like it before. It was a back stage glimpse at what celebrity life is really like. Some believe this was at the height of Madonna's success when she was beyond big.  Today no one has come close to the caliber she reached at that point. There was only her out there, whereas today there are so many and most are just marketed, packaged clones of what was already done.<br /><br />Madonna is brazen, bold and maybe even loud mouthed.  Is she playing it for the camera?  In some sequences there is a definite heightened version shown on screen of what she wanted people to see.  Other times she is completely oblivious to the camera's being there like for example when she's angry with her sound crew for not making sure that the sound and microphones were top notch.<br /><br />This isn't just about celebrity, this also showed Madonna's ferocious work ethic and attention to detail.  It displayed the business side of her that most are or were unaware of.  Siskel & Ebert had commented that this was someone who could run a business empire if she wanted to just quit music for good.<br /><br />At this point Madonna had rarely done interviews and she was way beyond powerful.  No one was quite sure what she was like.  This gave viewers an up close and personal view.  What was also great about this was it also showed her generous side by allowing her back up singers and dancers adequate screen time.<br /><br />The documentary is in black and white, but it cuts into color for the many on stage concert performances of the tour she was on while this was being filmed.  The Blonde Ambition Tour in 1990.  This was a technically staged concert that was so elaborate it had also never been done before and set the bar really high for performers and musicians to really put on a great show.  We later saw other artists like Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears and Lady Gaga do the same - just to name a few.<br /><br />This film was so well done and so well received that even the Madonna haters went to see it as well, coming out of the theaters saying things like, \\"Well I never liked her, but after seeing this I have to say I do admire how hard she works.  I have a new found respect for her.\\"<br /><br />If you can turn a life long hater to folding and admitting they have appreciation for her even if they don't care for her music then you know the film did its job.<br /><br />Madonna is much calmer and more spiritual now so I should warn that this documentary features strong language and sexual innuendo that might be deemed offensive to some.  However, most know what Madonna is like and can be, so no warning should be necessary.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the full tour concert has yet to be released on DVD, but in this film you do get an edited glimpse of some performances that include, \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Live to Tell\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Keep it Together\\".Jackson, Britney Spears and Lady Gaga do the same - just to name a few.<br /><br />This film was so well done and so well received that even the Madonna haters went to see it as well, coming out of the theaters saying things like, \\"Well I never liked her, but after seeing this I have to say I do admire how hard she works.

0307949508|4.0|First of all I must say that you really need a good stomach to read some of the things that happen in this book. One thing is clear, even it this is fiction it does mirror reality almost perfectly. The sex trade is a real problem nowadays all over the world. It almost seems like the only ones well organized are the criminals while the authorities are far from getting there. It's terrible to know that there are thousands of creepy louts willing to exploit, mistreat, abuse, hate and/or kill women just for being such.<br /><br />Now if you can stomach all this it's a great thriller to read. Dag Svensson and Mia Johansson a young couple are researching about the sex trade in Sweden. He's doing so as a journalist and she is doing it for her doctorate dissertation. Dag contacts Millennium to work for them and get his work published. They agree and will even publish a book on the subject. Mikael Blomkvist becomes good friends with the couple during the process. He'll be the editor for the project.<br /><br />In the meantime the ill-fated and sinister Bjurman gets in contact with an old enemy of Lisbeth Salander to hopefully get an ally and get rid of her for good. Things start to get messy as soon as Lisbeth finds out that there is a hit contract on her. Dag and Mia are tracking down a man known as Zala for their research, from whom not much is known or said.<br /><br />Three people end up dead and Salander is the prime suspect. A wild goose chase starts and Blomkvist decides to start his own investigation to prove that Lisbeth is innocent. I don't want to give the story away, but the book is a real page turner and will keep you on the edge until the end.

B003PIUC02|5.0|Since I don't subscribe to any of the premium channels on cable, I did not get a chance to see this when it originally ran on T.V.  Heard numerous complimentary comments about though from friends and co-workers.  It was certainly everything they described.  The language, nudity, and blood are a bit of a shock at first, however, you soon get past that as the story starts to unfold.  The series was addictive.<br /><br />I've already purchased Gods of the Arena, the prequel, and have pre-ordered season 2 of Blood and Sand.  The story even had me researching the real Spartacus on the Net, where I found that everything is based on fact - not only Spartacus and the basic story itself, but even the names of the main supporting characters.<br /><br />Can't wait to see more.
B000094Q3I|5.0|This is quite hypnotic, exiting, emotional...<br />Folk music may not be the first genre I think of when I reach for my CD collection (although I have some Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie), but this magnificent musician really delivers a very pleasurable CD. More urbane and sophisticated than many folk artists, Callier still sounds direct, like a blow in the head (but in a good way).<br />Excellent guitar work supplements magnificent, clear and strong vocals.<br /><br />Recommended to music fans across the scale of different musical tastes.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|THE FAULT IN OUR STARS<br />Review by Tess, (Books On Board)<br /><br />The Fault in our Stars is a book about living. It is about all that is life: Love, laughter, heartache, friendship, beauty, fear, loss, death, illness, adversity.... This book doesn't manipulate your emotions as most do but it brings tears to your eyes out of sheer knowledge and the registering in your brain of the beauty or ugliness, for that matter, Of every day living. Open your eyes to reality and its possibilities. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see and be enlightened.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Like other reviewers, I thought Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was a fantastic read but it was not what I was expecting - I expected horror and got mystery, fantasy, adventure and thrills. Not a bad trade off but again, unexpected.<br /><br />The story takes place between present day and 1940, specifically September the 3rd 1940. When Abe Portman dies suspiciously in the arms of his grandson, Jacob Portman, it sends Jacob's mental stability spiraling downward. With encouragement from his psychiatrist, Jacob and his father visit the children's home in Wales that his grandfather grew up in after his family was taken by the Nazis. During Jacob's three week visit he discovers the meaning behind his grandfather's last words while also discovering things about himself he never could have imagined. It is truly a life changing journey for Jacob.<br /><br />Riggs' writing is easy to read and written wonderfully while the story is easy to get lost in and fast-paced. Overall I do recommend this book to anyone the slightest bit interested in fantasy and mystery plus the black and white vintage photos are beautiful. I will add that this book is best purchased in a hard copy instead of a digital copy because the photos can not be fully appreciated on an e-reader (a tablet maybe.)
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Amy will be surely missed. Fresh, lovely cover of \\"Girl from Ipanema\\". \\"Halftime\\"...simply amazing, amazing, amazing! Can listen to it on repeat forever. What a talented life cut entirely too short. RIP Amy. Thanks for leaving us these gems.
B006BQI1V2|5.0|Kristen Scott Thomas, as a modern-day journalist, researches the WWII story of Jewish families who were evicted from their homes in Paris, brutally herded into the Velodrome and ultimately sent to German concentration camps.<br /><br />As her story unfolds, the journalist begins to suspect there's a link between the Paris apartment her husband's family owns and has passed down to them, and the story of one of these Jewish families. Her research suddenly becomes urgent and very personal. What she discovers could cause her marriage to unravel. The story hinges on an old key and a girl who desperately wants to find her brother.<br /><br />This is a riveting film. The viewer is spared any scenes of these families' horrible fates, but the anguished scenes of children being ripped from their parents, and husbands from wives, is heartbreaking. I often find that movies that go back and forth between generations don't work -- that you're interested in one story but not the other -- but this one works on all levels. Don't be concerned about subtitles -- you'll be so captivated by the film that you won't even notice them. The words just seem to seep into your consciousness.

1400069289|4.0|[Full disclosure: I received an Advanced Reader's Edition of the book courtesy of Goodreads.com's \\"First Reads\\" program and Random House publishing.]<br /><br />Recently the non-fiction shelf has been filled with a lot of hit books about the hows and whys of decision-making, written from the perspective of the (new-ish) field of behavioral economics. Notable examples include Thaler and Sunstein's [[ASIN:014311526X Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]], Malcolm Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]] or [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]], and Dan Ariely's [[ASIN:0061353248 Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions]]; I have read and enjoyed them all. And only a few pages into Charles Duhigg's \\"The Power of Habit\\", I knew this would be a favorite among these.<br /><br />The Prologue and Part One, \\"The Habits of Individuals\\", starts out strong, with plenty of engaging stories and summaries of scientific studies. Duhigg's explication is clear and understandable, not talking down to the reader nor assuming too much background in psychology. In chapter one we are introduced to the \\"habit loop\\" through some studies done on a mouse's brainwave activity when searching through a maze for the reward; the evening after reading about this I couldn't wait to share with my wife how interesting it was that the mouse could instantly return to the same thoughtless habit after weeks or months without having done it, as long as the cue and circumstances appeared the same. (I am trying not to spoil too much here, so forgive me if I don't explain!) Future topics throughout the book are smartly illustrated with diagrams showing the new examples in the same cue/routine/reward loop we learned from the mice, to further solidify the model in our memories.<br /><br />The second section covers \\"The Habits of Successful Organizations\\", appealing particularly to the entrepreneurs and business leaders, no doubt. Oddly, just as the first section on individuals contained some stories about businesses (including the history of marketing efforts behind Pepsodent toothpaste and Febreeze air freshener), these four chapters also contained some stories that are more focused on individuals (including the seemingly obligatory \\"marshmallow test\\" of delayed gratification)--but we can forgive this, because the author continues to weave the examples and stories quite cohesively as he fills out the details of his thesis.<br /><br />The last section, containing the final two chapters, doesn't hold together as well in my opinion. Chapter 8 speaks to \\"The Habits of Societies\\" well enough, with examples from the 60's Civil Rights movement and the explosive growth of the Saddleback Church; perhaps these examples didn't hold as much interest for me because they seem less practical or personally applicable than much of the earlier material. Chapter 9 then dives into much more speculative and heady territory, questioning the notion of \\"free will\\" in the face of all this evidence that we humans are so regulated by mere habit.<br /><br />A few things I particularly appreciated about \\"The Power of Habit\\":<br /><br />First, its practicality: From the start of the book I realized how I could personally apply much of what I had learned from the material in my own efforts for self-improvement. This is not the case with many similar books from the behavioral economics perspective (with a noted exception of the aforementioned \\"Nudge\\"). Since I have an advance copy of the book, this printing was not quite complete, and I see that there will be an Appendix with the appealing title of \\"A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas\\"--so when the final publication is available in March 2012, I am eager to pick it up to read more on this.<br /><br />Secondly, the integrity of the research: Some contemporary non-fiction books have a \\"fictional\\" feel to me in that they so single-mindedly pursue the author's thesis, neglecting to mention any holes in the arguments or contrary opinions (I would include much of Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining-but-poorly-argued prose here). My copy contains over 50 pages of detailed notes, references and bibliography, offering more than enough opportunity for me to follow up on the ideas and questions that came to mind while reading. Presumably Mr. Duhigg's experience in investigative journalism gives him a predilection for thorough research!<br /><br />To sum up: \\"The Power of Habit\\" not only gave me another perspective on human behavior, it filled my head with ideas about why I act the way I do and how I might willfully change some of it. It is an easy and enjoyable read, and I may even make a habit or re-reading it from time to time in an effort to hone my new habit-shaping skills.nal\\" feel to me in that they so single-mindedly pursue the author's thesis, neglecting to mention any holes in the arguments or contrary opinions (I would include much of Malcolm Gladwell's entertaining-but-poorly-argued prose here).

B000JQUGVI|5.0|Accurate, timeless observations about human nature bundled into a narrative about a winning character named Becky, whom you must admire even while you disdain some of her choices. The writing style is a sly wink thinly disguised by compassion and tolerance. Forget that dumb movie with Reese Witherspoon (though I love her!); read the book instead. It's eye-opening for people who resemble Becky's antithesis, Amelia, ... simple people like me. If you are blind to corporate politics (like me), this book will show you how the world really operates while you are busy being nice to people just because they're there, rather than because it will help you win influence.<br /><br />Becky is a talented climber trapped by British social hierarchy. The book begins on the day she and her friend Amelia graduate from what in our society today would be high school, and contrasts their circumstances, choices and life adventures.<br /><br />Thackery's writing style and psychological depth make me think of George Elliot, Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy, but Thackery is like none of these. Imagine today's Jon Stewart, with his wit and perspective, but wearing white gloves, a top hat and a monocle in the early 1880s British Empire.

0061969656|4.0|This is tale installment six of a series about a Saxon warlord of King Alfred's who is perpetually fighting the Danelaw encroachment on Saxon England.<br /><br />The hero is interesting for his incongruence with Alfred's side. He's a Saxon but was raised by Danes. He has an aristocratic heritage but was more than once in his life a slave. Though a Saxon ethnically, and at the point of the book, the Saxons are converted to Catholicism, he's still a heathen worshipping Thor. These kinds of character contrasts are awesomely powerful tools in the hands of Cornwell the master crafter of these adventuresome stories.<br /><br />At this juncture Uhtred is not merely a champion for the king but a Jarl of sorts, with his own shield-men, colorful characters alike, though few in number due to Uhtred's ongoing lack of funds. King Alfred dies and Uhtred predictably does not want to pledge his loyalty to his heir but does so. There is raiding, pillaging, viking, and shield-walls along the way.<br /><br />If you are familiar with and like Cornwell this fine book satisfies and is worth the wait and price twice over. If not, but you like fantasy genres like Conan or Lord of the Rings, you will certainly love this series. Really if one like's Homer's Illiad I recommend this book and like all good works of adventure, there will be some similarities. Are these similarities formulaic crutches as one reviewer suggested? Of course not. All paintings will have a subject, a foreground, a backround, lighting, perspective, etc. To remove an integral aspect of a hero story is to create a purposefully inferior piece of art. Ever since Aristotle we have known the basic elements of dramatic story and for Cornwell to follow that pattern is to accomplish his work effectively and efficiently without losing energy on experimental trifles. And that is indeed why Cornwell is productive and prolific and well published and we can thankfully expect more from the man. Well done and keep it coming!

B00004ST9Q|5.0|As a lifelong Whitney fan, I LOVE this representation of her work! This is much better than the double CD that was released (although I LOVE her with George Michael on If I Told You That). I'm still watching the DVD so I haven't gotten through it entirely however, I need to give compliments for the concert version of Didn't We Almost Have It All. PHENOMENAL performance! Whitney gave her all on that stage! Although I was a fan, I was too young to really attend her performances then so I definitely appreciate the art of film making. The filming and recording is fabulous!  If you are a lover of vocals, wonderful writing of lyrics we won't EVER get again in this lifetime (i.e. Diane Warren and all the fabulous others), music that fills you inside when you play it loud enough, and the wonderful talent that came through Whitney, YOU WILL WANT THIS DVD. RIP Whitney Nip Houston! I will definitely always love you!

159102594X|3.0|I've been reading all the reviews here on the ol' Amazon.com and for some funny reason I think I agree with just about all of them. This is a very different book.  If you come to this from the traditional high fantasy genre, you may hate this book.  If you like a crazy book with quirky, funny, and stupid characters that includes loads of foul language and violence, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />There was a time when the fantasy genre was very much at the PG level when it came to sex and language.  Authors would go out of there way to make up new words or phrases to depict the foulest of language.  Sex was scarcely mentioned and typically happened off-screen (to borrow a term).  This is not the way Abercrombie writes.  He is at the vanguard of in-your-face fantasy that includes the foulest of language, the  most brazen sex, and the bloodiest of battles.  Nothing is spared.<br /><br />So... if you were looking for the old high fantasy type of novel... you may hate this book.<br /><br />As for me, I hung in there to the end.  I am finding that as I am reading a lot of new authors of late there is a pretty consistent pattern that I see Abercrombie falling into.  The beginning is just awful.  It takes a couple hundred pages before you really figure out who these characters are and what is going on around them.  I've been told this is called being 'dropped right into the action'.  However, I find this a bit disconcerting and was very difficult to follow.  If I didn't have a friend pushing me on to finish the book, I might have abandoned early on.<br /><br />Another difficult thing that the author gives us is a list of characters that are difficult at best to have any empathy for.  In the end, I was kinda rooting for Logen and of course most people's favorite character, Glotka.  However, these are characters with the most violent bent you will ever come across in fiction.<br /><br />By the time I finished this first book, I was actually interested enough to finish out the trilogy and also read \\"Best Served Cold\\".  So I have a pretty good flavor for what Abercrombie brings to the table.  Stick with it, it does get better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o interesting characters<br />o different take on the Fantasy genre<br />o lots of action and war scenes<br /><br />Cons:<br />o difficult start<br />o rambling plot - takes a while to get going<br /><br />Overall - this first book in the series is easily identifiable as an author's first book.

1936719118|5.0|This book is a positive wake up call to how we should all manage the responsibility we possess as business leaders. Whether you agree with Derek's approach or not is irrelevant... it's his story and it's very helpful to anyone who ever runs, or hopes to run their own business. It's a short read and one that I am going to share.
0316098329|1.0|I started reading the 'Room' by Emma Donoghue. I read about 10 pages. And I'm ending there. I'll explain why.<br /><br />It might feel OK at times to look through a peephole, and at someone's life. Books do that. In a fantasy sort of way. But what you wish to find on the other side, is a totally different situation.<br /><br />The book has an interesting approach. The narrator is a 5-year old kid, describing the world as he knows it, as his mother has presented it to him for his own protection. Protection from the reality of their confinement in one room, trapped there by some monster-man, locked away from the world for ever.<br /><br />The story is horrifying, just because it could so easily be real. It might even be real; I didn't go as far as checking it. Unlike other readers, who may be intimidated by a terrible story (in ways that I cannot understand), I cannot take it in. Yes, it makes you curious at first. But living through such a situation, even through my imagination, is unbearable to me. Excuse me for being sensitive; too sensitive, as it seems. But I cannot.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I just finished this series & I really loved it until the fourth book abruptly ended. There is a fifth book, but the reviews I read aren't very promising. I'm debating on whether to cut my losses & skip it or get it & decide for myself.  I love the charachters & all the elaborate details of their lives, but was disappointed when it just ended without resoving a lot issues. I gave it 4 stars because I couldn't stop reading it. I took away a star for leaving me hanging. And, why not include all 5 books in the set?!

B005VPRFSY|5.0|This is Legos second remake of the classic Star Wars Droid Escape in Episode IV. In this model, the escape pod is much more detailed and bigger then the previous version making it more realistic. Additionally, the previous escape pod version only came with two mini figures that included R2-D2 and C3PO. In this model you are getting the additional two sand troopers that are well worth it. The two sand troopers boast a new armor that looks like they've been in an actually sand storm. The speeder bike that is included in the model is not that detailed, but is a nice addition for the sand troopers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great model to get for the money. Not difficult at all, and an easy build to complete and get playing with in no time!

0439023513|4.0|Reading this book, I felt emotionally wronged, yet rationally enlightened. I believe that Collins wrote this story as realistically as she could depict the story line and I applaud her for keeping it consistent since the first book. This book is definitely the most brutal and honest of the two as you will read, both through it's conclusion, character development, and imagery. But there are reasons for why such brutal story-telling is absolutely necessary for this kind of book. She isn't trying to teach the readers a lesson of war. SHE'S TELLING A STORY THAT INVOLVES HER CHARACTERS IN WAR. To make this story any less brutal, would be giving up that consistency of realism that Collins successfully portrays.<br /><br />NO SPOILERS.<br /><br />1. Too brutal? This is war. I can't believe some of the reviews slandering this story as some kind of sleazy anti-war propaganda. War in itself spurs anti-war sentiment. Whether the purpose of a war is supported or opposed, there will always be the brutal details of war that everyone opposes. If its actions and impact on people weren't brutal, then it wouldn't be a war. So why (and exactly how) should Collins portray it any other way in this story?<br /><br />2. The characters seem different to you! Again. This is war. I'll only describe the main character in order to keep from spoiling the other characters. Katniss is a very screwed up person by what she has seen and been through in the past books AND by what she is faced with in this one. She has always been a tough and strong-minded character, but war and death has the power to crush the most strong-willed person into an emotionally confused state. To side with this person or that person? To behave like my old self or acknowledge that I have changed? Is this right in the name of the war effort or is this wrong going by my conscience? Don't forget that she's traumatized beyond hell. So of course she acts differently with certain characters and thinks differently.<br />Why shouldCollins write her any other way?<br /><br />3. Unnecessary events and situations! That's WAR! It hurts when something happens that shocks the happiness out of you or/and that you absolutely did not want to happen. Well, that's the big picture- that's what makes up war. And in this story, don't think that war and the fight for power will distinguish amongst well-known (and well-loved) characters of who gets hurt/killed/traumatized and who stays immune to it all. There are certain events I really wish Collins hadn't written, but you realize that they are rational and, sometimes necessary, in order to fit in with the realism this story conveys- just like the character development.<br /><br />4. Some parts of the book are boring. This I can agree with. We are more into Katniss' head than ever, which isn't exactly a good thing considering how traumatized and emotionally wavering she is. But then again, this wouldn't be a good first-person narrative if we didn't get Katniss' complete thoughts on things.<br /><br />5. The Ending (No Spoilers). Also have to agree with other reviewers that the ending was written too fast comparing it to the pace throughout the beginning and middle of the books (ahem, Katniss' 3-page inner monologues). There is not alot of build up towards significant events as was in the beginning and middle. I also wished the fate of certain characters had been written with more detail, suspense, and epicness. I subtracted a star for this. I wished everything would have been wrapped up with more detail, but like I said before, the events in the end make sense considering what this story is set in.<br /><br />In conclusion: not one thing in this story seems like bad writing to give it less than 3 stars for.<br />The beginning and middle of this book is very exciting to read, but towards the ending, things dampen up considerably.The writing style perfectly fits with the changed setting and mood of the story, the characters behave in a way that perfectly fitstheir individual circumstances, and all events occur in realistic and rational fashion.<br />People who knew the setting of these books involved war and harsh totalitarian society, praised Collins for the realism and rational story-telling of the first two, AND THEN cursed that their ideal ending was not granted to them- well, uh, you guys should have looked for a book with a cozier plot development.<br /><br />And for soon-to-be readers, I recommend guarding your heart as you read while opening your mind.

B0044KU7EQ|3.0|I always wanted a collection like this one. I remember a French documentary about blues where a guy says something like<br />\\"Blues is a man without a job,  a man who lost  his woman ...\\"<br /><br />I checked a few cds and the sound is in general very good. Unfortunately, this is the worse designed box of cds that I've ever seen.<br />The box is not like normal square boxes of cds. This one has  a different format and it looks like a box for<br />singles vinyl records.<br /><br />The cds are disposed on the horizontal, in three divisions. Each one of them has about 17 cds. If I want to hear cd 47, for example, I need to take out ten cds that<br />are over cd 47 and it is not easy to take the cds from the box because there is no room for your fingers. The last cds are  very difficult to reach. As a matter of fact,<br />the only way to reach the last cds without damaging the box is turning the box upside down and throwing all cds on the table.  The box is  \\"user hostile\\".<br />Or, better saying, the box is a really lousy job. What the label did is not acceptable.<br /><br />This box reminds me of Columbo's first dvds box set launched in the UK, which is different from the one launched in the US. It has the shape of  a cigar box. Nice  idea but the dvds are disposed on the horizontal and are  very difficult to handle. As a matter of fact<br /> the studio relaunched the box in  a more user friendly format.<br /><br />I don't know if I will keep the cds and  spend extra money buying  a decent  box to store  the cds or if I will just return the box set as a protest against the lousy, stupid design of the box.<br /><br />PS. The box set comes with a Hohner  harmonica and a pamphlet advertising Hohner's products. I wonder if the label shaped the box the way they did just in order to fit the harmonica in the box and profit from the ad.

B003G4W49C|5.0|They call this book a classic for good reason. It's one of those great Y/A books that doesn't talk down to kids like they're dumb. The story is so amazing and original and clever that I literally could not put the book down and stayed up WAY past my bedtime to finish it. The twist at the end is one of the best I've ever read. The characters are well-written and easy to relate to. I can't wait to buy the sequel.
B004X75RK4|4.0|I watch this film when I want to get lost in a comic scenario reminiscent of like-minded \\"Desk Set\\" black and white films.  The bonus to this well-acted, mostly well-written movie is the Alaskan scenery in addition to its brief love-kiss of New York.  Ryan Reynolds' character stands up nicely to the tough, then vulnerable Sandra Bullock.  It's a playful, silly, undemanding entertainment:  nice for sick days, cold days, bad days, days needing a bit of cheer and goes easy on the eye.  A perfect \\"rom-com.\\"
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I'd been wanting to order this book for my Kindle for a while, but the price never dropped. Finally, I said to heck with it & was so glad I did! The story is well written & engrossing. The author does an excellent job of playing at the truth without giving away too much. Through the book, I kept thinking, \\"Does he...?\\" But, then the author would throw in a clever little twist to keep me guessing up to the end. A fun, quick read.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|This movie is fantastic. I would go as far as to say this is the best animation I have ever seen. There is so much detail put into this. The art style is just phenomenal. The story is good enough to keep the movie going. Before watching this I read several articles saying that this entire movie was hand drawn without using the aid of computers and is likely to be one of the last films ever to do that. I also read that because it is hand drawn, it took 5+ years for it to come out. It definitely shows. If you are a fan of good, detailed animation, this is a must watch.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I am a big fan of Angry Birds so of course I had to play Angry Birds: Rio. I have played and completed all (currently) three Angry Birds games and overall this is the worst of the three games. The graphics are nice and the gameplay is familiar, but there are a few major flaws.<br />First, some of the levels have a HORRIBLE design. Especially on Carnival Upheaval but there are others that are equally bad. It's almost as if they let a little kid design some of these levels. They have a poor flow and no obvious point of attack.<br />Second, the caged birds and monkeys are annoying and don't behave like you would expect. I've dropped monkeys the entire height of the level and it didn't kill them. I kept telling myself, \\"there is no way a pig would have survived that!\\"  The pigs are a much more enjoyable opponent.<br />Third, I didn't enjoy the boss battles. It was pretty obvious that the bosses avoided your bird throws making them extremely hard to hit. Plus they get more erratic the closer they get to death. It was an interesting twist but one I hope Rovio doesn't use in the other games.<br />Therefore I give this game 3 stars. If you're a hard core Angry Birds fan you should play it but otherwise I would stick to the other Angry Bird flavors.
1401232590|5.0|I just finished reading this book(yes for the first time) and thought it was wonderful. I have been hearing for years that this is one of the best Batman stories ever told. I would completely agree. I am by no means a Jeph Loeb fan but this is probably the best thing I have read that is written by him. I wish there were more \\"detective\\" or mystery Batman stories written like this. My only complaint is that other Jeph Loeb stories are very similar to this one.<br /><br />Artwork was awesome.<br />Writing was awesome.<br /><br />A must read for Batman Fans.
0439023513|5.0|This was a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy. I can only compare it to \\"Ender's Game\\" - and that is extremely high praise, indeed.<br />When I first closed the book last night, I felt shattered, empty, and drained.

B0060FXDCG|5.0|The transformers trilogy box set is one of the most anticipated collection items for transformers fans and entertainers. I personally find this box to be priced more reasonable than previous individual releases because of unnecessary making the movie disc that came along. However, it's worth if you're a professional movie person who wishes to enjoy behind the scene footage.
1451648537|4.0|Could have easily been 5 stars, but I gave it 4: 5 for the subject (Steve Jobs), 3 for the mediocre job Isaacson did, averages to 4.<br /><br />For starters, it's about 1/3rd too long for what it contains. It's as if the publishers knew the audience wanted a beefy book of almost 600 pages, so they drew out what would have better been served with 400.  A lot of the detail is mundane and superfluous and doesn't add to the story, hence it serves to detract and take away some of the drama. The author often makes mention of \\"intersection of arts and technology\\" but he doesn't really make the effort to embellish or describe what that means. Maybe it's because he doesn't have a background in technology, but whatever, as a result it comes across as a hollow tag line.<br /><br />I'm an Isaacson fan too, his biography on Kissinger was one of the most engaging and chilling I've ever read, but this just isn't one of his better efforts.<br /><br />Ultimately it could have used another editing. Makes me wonder if it was rushed to market to capitalize on Jobs time of death.  Hmmm....<br /><br />Nonetheless it still a must read for the insights that come directly from Jobs and are recorded here. The section at the end where its Jobs describing his approach to business, management and what he learned, is priceless.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|A professional reviewer called this a \\"thinking man's action movie\\"...and I tend to agree.  It is definitely a throwback to the 80's, as the stylized direction and soundtrack remind me a bit of \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" or even \\"Miami Vice\\" (the 80's show - not the crappy movie they made a few years ago).  I also found it reminiscent of David Lynch, but with a real ending that didn't leave you confused for hours afterward, and no mind-blowing abstractions.  If you're a fan of the \\"Fast and Furious\\" movies, you're in for a disappointment.  However, if you are a critical movie-watcher, and enjoy an artfully presented semi-indie action flick with a healthy dose of suspense, then you're going to love this.<br />...A side note: The movie is worth watching simply to see Albert Brooks as a calmly psychopathic crime-boss killer rather than his usual everyman comedic persona.  SPOILER ALERT: Nemo's Dad stabs a guy in the eye with a fork.

I loved going back to when you could buy a caddilac convertible for under 500bucks and a soda for five cents. What fun. I didn't love toward the end and he went back to the pretty bleak reality even though i knew he would probably go that direction somewhere in the book and seven though i knew it could be undone but otherwise, fun to get lost in the 60's and also learner a lot about the history of that time, even enjoyed the speculative conversations with Oswald etc.

B0029LHX1W|5.0|This is a really incredible book! From the very beginning I felt sucked into the world of Stalinist Russia.

This was one of the best books I have read in a quite a long time.
0307454568|5.0|Sometimes a long build up can lose readers and fall flat but in Stieg Larsson's series about the fascinating Lisbeth Salander, we become witnesses to a conspiracy as it unfolds. We, the readers, have the most amount of information given from every side of the story and yet when an action or reaction strikes it catches us unaware. The ambition and desperation surrounding the events of this one girl envelopes the concept what it can feel like when the whole world is out to get you.<br /><br />The book begins as an instant continuation of the second novel before slowly taking a life of its own. Scenarios unfold like a multi-player chess match as factions move into defensive and offensive positions towards obtaining their own goals. Lisbeth stays to her own gruff, stubborn self as she learns what it means to care and be cared about, what it means to respond and be responsible. The Hornet's Nest is part thriller, part legal novel and all Stieg Larsson. This was perhaps his last book and if so, he left behind a fantastic legacy. Thank you Stieg.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|The throwback-style animation (the dying art of hand-drawn) does a superb job executing a very simple storyline.  The characters are NOT original, and though they feel familiar when compared to most anime archetypes the movie does offer some hidden character dimensions that later unveil as the story progresses.  It is a racer movie - simple and plain.  But the beauty of this ride lies in the method with which the story is given - completely imaginative, not just in style but in technical delivery.  Great pacing.  Funny and entertaining.  Two Thumbs Up from an avid Anime-head.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|Right before I published my own novel, I DEVOURED this book. Although I ended up not using a lot of Locke's strategies, the parts that I \\"have\\" implemented have really seemed to help with sales. It's still pretty early, so we'll see what happens in another few months, but so far I have NO complaints.<br /><br />My only criticism is that if I (or another writer) were to spend the time that Locke does on Twitter, developing and nurturing the type of following he has, we'd probably have time for little else--especially writing. But then again, that's just my opinion. Overall, I really enjoyed these tips at this price. A definite recommend for anyone considering independent publishing.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|GOT has been comprehensively reviewed in great depth by almost everyone on here so I won't harp on.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is as close to perfect as a TV show can get. The production is of the quality you'd expect from Hollywood, the acting and characterisation is amazing and the script is completely faithful to the awesome books.<br /><br />One of the best things about the series in my opinion is the immersivness of the world in which it is set. You find yourself after an episode, imagining what it'd be like to live in Kings Landing, to be a member of one of the great houses or be shivering in the cold with the Night's Watch. Amazing story telling.<br /><br />The characters are complex and the net of political intrigue and conspiracy thicker than any other story I've read or seen on the screen. The fact that it is a TV show makes it all the more remarkable in it's achievement.<br /><br />A truly stunning piece of television.
0439023491|5.0|I have a friend who has been encouraging me to read this book for at least two years.  I usually trust her book recommendations, but she just couldn't sell me on this particular title. It just didn't call to me.<br /><br />Fast forward to the announcement of our November selection for Main Street Book Club: The Hunger Games.  Sigh.<br /><br />Within the first few pages of the book, I was hooked.  Suzanne Collins manages to present Katniss in a way to make her utterly believable-- that is, you want to like her, but you are not sure that you do.  Prematurely thrust into adulthood by the death of her father and her mother's subsequent breakdown, Katniss is tasked with caring for her younger sister and mother.  In order to survive in grim District 12 she must join her friend, Gale, in secret hunts outside the district and deal in the black market.  Serious and tough, she does what needs to be done.<br /><br />Little by little, we begin to understand that life in District 12 means more than food shortages and coal mining.  Each of the districts is forced to hold an annual lottery to choose two teens to compete in the Hunger Games.  A game that means death for all but one competitor.<br /><br />It is not a surprise that Katniss becomes a competitor.  The surprise is HOW she becomes a competitor.  And how she manages to change all the rules....<br /><br />My verdict:  Read it!  What are you waiting for? Go get it right now!
B006O5YHUY|4.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, there's little new ground broken here in terms of story telling. Some may find the similarities to other sports tales (the obvious one being Stallone's \\"Rocky\\") a bit jarring but, in my opinion at least, \\"Warrior\\" stands out from the crowd.<br /><br />It tells the tale of two brothers in conflict over a family past. Tom Hardy plays the tortured ex marine, desperate to redeem his imaginary failure in the Iraq war whilst Joel Edgerton, hardy's brother, is a financially struggling science teacher clambering to provide for his family and stave off bankruptcy. Nick Nolte really stands out with a fantastic performance playing the reformed alcoholic father striving for forgiveness from his sons and, I think, nails the part with real emotion and power. Throughout the film his guilt over his past is laid bare by his character culminating in a heart breaking scene where he falls off the wagon giving a glimpse at his alcoholic history.<br /><br />The brothers have very different motivations. Hardy's character is difficult to like but excellent none the less, spending a lot of the film brooding over his perceived conduct whilst serving as a marine and struggling/refusing to reconcile with not only his father but his brother as well. There is nobility there however, conveyed in his reason for entering the contest. After all, he intends to give the prize money to the widow of a fallen comrade making the viewer have conflicting feelings for him. By that I mean he is a generally unlikable character but has a noble purpose. Hardy plays the part excellently, giving a convincing portrayal as a lost soul intent on redemption and has a real air of menace both in and out of the ring.<br /><br />His brother played by Edgerton, is a completely different kettle of fish. A school teacher, he impresses a sense of civility as a family man simply trying to provide for his clan. Throughout the film the viewer is convinced that, given the choice,he wouldn't delve into the violent world which he is part of. Edgerton brilliantly portrays the grim desperation of a man with little choice left.<br /><br />The film itself is well paced with an excellently balanced mixture of heartfelt emotion and bone shattering fight sequences. The general atmosphere is similar to that of the aforementioned \\"Rocky\\" in terms of the fact it's set in a city hit by recession with a war torn world stage backdrop, not to mention the underdog main story.<br /><br />And therein lay the only jarring aspect of the story for me. Hardy's character is portrayed throughout the entire film as a virtually unstoppable behemoth of the fighting world, making short work of every competitor he faces without exception. And I mean that as literally as possible as the average length of one of Hardy's fights is around thirty seconds. Edgerton's character however, is never portrayed as much more than average, his only strength being the motivation to provide for his family. As a result of this, the ending feels distinctly unbelievable with Hardy's much more ferocious and capable character being beaten by his significantly weaker and less capable brother. The film would have avoided this if Hardy's character maybe had a few more close calls in the tournament, possibly giving the idea he is at least beatable but instead, he wades through rival competitors with apparently no effort.<br /><br />Regardless of this last point however, I still would rate this film very highly indeed and would recommend it to anyone who is fan of this genre. A great film throughout, slightly let down with an implausible ending.
031612057X|1.0|This book has received overwhelmingly positive reviews.  A quick glance on Amazon shows that positive reviews outnumber negative reviews by 10 to 1.  Fully 75% of the reviewers at GoodReads rated it 4 or 5 star.    So, once again, I am left to wonder if I am really just that difficult to please?  I don't think I am.  I read a lot and I truly enjoy most of what I read.  I don't require a full background history on every character.  I can overlook a plot hole that can swallow a truck.  I can even forgive a truncated ending.  I cannot forgive boring.    Yes, I said it.  This book was boring.    The \\"voice\\" of five year old narrator Jack was something akin to nails on a chalkboard.  We are supposed to believe that his mother taught him to read, write and do higher math, but did not correct his grammar? Not likely!    I understand that the author wanted us to feel the frustration of daily life in an 11x11 space.  She did that. Over and over and over... I thought the first section of the book would never end.    I will admit that there were a few good passages in the last third of the book.  The description of Jack re-learning to walk and move was especially well done.  I also enjoyed Jack's interactions with Leo, who seemed to be the only sane adult in the book.    My verdict:  Skip it!  The idea is great, but the execution is lacking.

B0058ZZDVS|4.0|From the first episode onwards, I loved this show. Gabriel Macht who plays Harvey Spectre, a suave, shark like lawyer in New York, hires college drop out Mike Ross, played by Patrick Adams, as his new protégé. Mike is a hyper intelligent rogue, previously making a living helping people cheat on their Bar Exams and lending a hand to his drug dealing best friend. After a brief demonstration of his abilities, Mike is hired by an impressed Spectre into one of New York's leading Law firms...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the series isn't perfect which is reflected in the four star review. I may be being a little finicky but the show can be guilty of being slightly formulaic i.e Harvey and Mike take on a case, encounter some unforeseen difficulties but eventually come up with a clever solution ultimately winning the day.<br /><br />Right, now onto why this is such a good show.<br /><br />Quite frankly, even with the above minor issue, this is by far one of the most addictive and enjoyable shows on TV. Macht plays Spectre with a superb polish, encapsulating the persona of a big shot New York lawyer with apparent ease but successfully keeping his character three dimensional, hinting at hidden moral depths.<br /><br />Adams is brilliant as well. His character is super intelligent yet naive at the same time, a balance which, from an acting perspective, is incredibly difficult to maintain. As a result of his naivety , he frequently has to turn to his mentor for help giving extra depth to their working relationship. Adams acts the part excellently and the viewer is forever wanting Mike to succeed but never completely sure that he will (despite my earlier comments).<br /><br />I think the main thing though, and this is something which a lot of TV shows don't seem to manage all the time, is that both of the protagonists are extremely likable, but for very different reasons. Their characters are an almost perfect balance for each other and continually take the story in different directions. Mike's career is often jeopardized by his shady past which gives an excellent progressive storyline thus not falling into the trap a lot of shows fall in to where it ends up being 'The Weekly Adventures Of...'<br /><br />In conclusion, regardless of a slight predictability, a fantastic show which I would highly recommend. Likable and clever characterisation, excellent stories, intelligent script and enough of a progressive back story to keep you going back.
1594744769|5.0|I first stumbled upon Miss Peregrine when I was seeking a book for our October Book Club meeting.  A \\"you pick\\" month with a horror/suspense theme, I circled around all the standards, but kept coming back to this book with the strange girl on the cover.  In the end, I went with a book recommended by Word Nerd Teen, but I kept Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children on my \\"to be read\\" list.<br /><br />Three months later, and I finally snagged a copy from the library.  Months of anticipation- could it possibly live up to my expectations? Yes! I picked it up to read a few chapters before dinner and finished it in the wee hours of the next morning. It wasn't a case of life or death cliffhangers at the end of chapters, but merely the fact that the story moved along so well there was never a logical stopping point.  I ambled merrily through the book without a thought of stopping.<br /><br />The most unusual and wonderful part of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the inclusion of vintage photographs featuring unsmiling and eerie subjects.  On their own, several of the photos could only be described as disturbing, but paired with Riggs' prose and they become another dimension to a new friend.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is considered a Young Adult book, but I would recommend parental guidance for the tween/young teen set.  As mentioned, the photos are disturbing and Jacob isn't necessarily a model child.  There are certainly some 8 year olds that would love this book, while others would be beset by nightmares.  For that matter, I know some adults who would have nightmares from the pictures....<br /><br />I am already hearing scuttlebutt about a movie and a second book.  I will be very surprised if there isn't a Miss Peregrine movie in the next two years- it seems tailor made for a screen treatment. (I am sure it is no coincidence that author Ransom Riggs is also a film maker in Los Angeles.)  As for a second book- I sincerely hopethat is just a rumour.  The best part of this book is not the adventure, but the introduction and formation of the characters, especially \\"the peculiars\\".<br /><br />My verdict: Read it! If you have adventurous children, consider reading it aloud.  This is exactly the type of book that I would have shared with my tweens- it is so much more exciting and less haunting when read together.<br /><br />Don't worry if you don't have kids to share this story, like many Young Adult titles, it is meant to crossover to the adult market.  It is bound to become a cultural phenomenon in the near future, so get on board early and be considered the hip one in your book club/office/neighborhood.

B002KFJWBG|5.0|This is a fantastic album. Though the only mainstream hit on it was Time of the Season, every song is a simply beautiful example of sunshine-y psychedelic pop. Odessey and Oracle is usually relegated to underground cult status, and this is a bit of an enigma. On an inital listen it is true that if certain songs are randomly heard by themselves(like if your iPod were on shuffle), there is not much on the surface to differentiate from any other late 60's British baroque pop songs. However, listened to as a whole from start to finish, the album becomes oddly addictive. Somehow the songs manage to form a cohesive work, like movements from a symphony combining to make a perfect whole. This is interesting since this is not a concept album; there are no common themes lyrically or sonically, though the songs are not vastly different from one another either. Upon further listens, the small nuances that seem inconsequential at first start to come out, and it becomes easier to hear how the songs are each beautiful creations of their own. Over 40 years later, it manages to sound fresh and somehow current. This is possibly in part due to certain bands like the Black Hollies and the Shins reviving late 60's psychedelic pop, and elaborate vocal harmonies being en vogue in independent music, a la Midlake and Fleet Foxes. This may be why it remains a cult classic; it really has no particular era that it can fit into purely. The amalgam of elements lend it a credibility during almost any decade whilst still standing outside of the mainstream. Heavy analysis aside though, this album is light, fun, poignant, catchy, simple, complex and utterly beautiful. It definitely wriggles into your mind and firmly plants itself there to become an instant favorite.

B004YM6JK0|3.0|NOTE: This review is a work in progress and currently only covers episodes 1-15 of season 7. I'll post an update after the final 8 episodes of the season air. This review also contains spoilers for the season. I've tried to keep them to a minimum but some of my problems with the season can't be easily discussed without revealing some major spoilers. So I recommend reading at your own risk.<br /><br />I've been watching Supernatural since season 1. So you could say I'm a long term fan of the series. Somehow the writers on this show managed to not only raise the stakes each season, but they also managed to top themselves with the overall story arc, standalone episodes, and character moments.<br /><br />Season 4 marked a major turning point in the series with more serialized storytelling and the introduction of angels and heaven to the show's mythology. Season 5 continued on in that same manner but upped the stakes even more by introducing Lucifer and the apocalypse. The war between heaven and hell that had been brewing for the previous seasons finally came to a head.<br /><br />I was initially skeptical of season 6 but they managed to raise the bar yet again. Rather than making the stakes larger than the apocalypse, they raised the stakes in more personal ways for the characters and by introducing a number of mysteries that appeared to be somewhat disconnected. By the end of the season, everything came full circle and all of the smaller mysteries were clearly part of a much larger story. The cliffhanger for the season raised the stakes yet again and promised a completely new situation when the show came back the following fall.<br /><br />That brings me to season 7. Conceptually, season 7 should feel fresh and original. It doesn't deal with angels or demons. Instead, it introduces a brand new breed of monster for the Winchesters to fight: the Leviathans. New rules, new abilities. They can be summed up as \\"so many humans to eat, so little time.\\" They can't be killed or stopped in the usual means and they have the ability to take on the form of anyone they eat. They're more about infiltration and indirect attacks than the usual methods we're used to with angels and demons.<br /><br />Despite the fantastic setup and the strong start, sadly season 7 has been a mixed bag so far. It started with a huge burst of energy and featured one of the strongest Castiel character episodes to date. And then most of the arcs and plot threads were conveniently swept under the rug in favor of Sam/Dean angst, the return of the monster of the week format found in earlier seasons, and the systematic removal of most supporting characters and familiar places/items that fans of the series have come to know and love.<br /><br />What should have been the perfect opportunity to explore the new threat from purgatory has quickly become a long, fairly uninteresting, tired slog. The Sam/Dean angst that has been at the core of the series since the very first episode isn't nearly enough to carry the show by itself anymore, and yet they seem to be focusing almost entirely on that. The series evolved over the course of seasons 4, 5, and 6. It introduced numerous supporting characters to help inject some much needed variety into the rapidly aging formula and to shake up the usual Sam/Dean interaction.<br /><br />Season 7 eliminates all of the surviving supporting characters (with the exception of Sheriff Jody Mills and Crowley), gets rid of the Impala (seriously?!), and introduces a new, highly paranoid character that sort of replaces Bobby (and with none of the personality).<br /><br />The removal of the familiar, in theory, should be pushing the brothers to new levels of desperation. While new territory and ultimately a good idea, in practice they've barely done anything with it. The brothers are supposed to be running for their lives from the Leviathans and yet they stop in town after town to deal with mundane cases that we've seen them solve several times over and aren't allowed to get any additional information on what the Leviathans are up to (after all, it isn't the season finale yet...). The Impala hasn't been in use for about 10 to 11 episodes.<br /><br />One of the things that has helped keep Supernatural fresh for so long is the inclusion of clever dialogue and plot twists. Season 7 still mostly has the clever dialogue but overall the stories are pretty run of the mill and have a definite \\"been there, done that\\" kind of feel to them. With an exception here or there, even the monsters have been rather easy to defeat (the low point being vampire-like monsters that can be killed with a silver knife to the chest *yawn*). Even the usual high amounts of gore have been rather lacking this season.<br /><br />It's been interesting to see how the brothers cope without all of their usual help from Bobby and Castiel. However, the problem is that nothing really feels any different. They're going up against the same old monsters and the Leviathan plot is pretty much where it was at when the season started. All we know is that they can't be killed, they're rapidly taking over the planet, and they enjoy eating people. Add in one of the most uninteresting villains (Dick Roman) and I've been finding this season to be rather disappointing. I always used to look forward to this show every week and this year I've often been finding myself looking at the clock whenever it's on. The story is almost at a standstill, the brother angst feels tired and forced, and many monster of the week stories this year feel like the writers are simply going through the motions.<br /><br />They can and should be able to do better than this.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just realized that I never came back to update this review after seeing the rest of the season.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my opinion of the season remains the same after seeing it in its entirety. Starting with \\"The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo,\\" the pace of the season picked up some. It also introduced Felicia Day in a recurring role, which was a brilliant decision. The Impala also ended up making a brilliant return in the final arc of the season. It really drove home just how much that car is a part of the style of the show. It just isn't the same without it. The Leviathan arc ended up not going anywhere particularly interesting and it was concluded almost as quickly as it was introduced. That said, I did find its resolution to be relatively satisfying overall. But it definitely didn't need all the set up it received. They had about 6 episodes of story for the Leviathans that was dragged out over the course of the entire season.<br /><br />The good news is its conclusion freed up the new showrunner (Jeremy Carver starting in season 8) to do whatever they wanted with the storyline and left the door open for introducing a larger supporting cast. The season finale also managed to set up an interesting premise for season 8.d aren't allowed to get any additional information on what the Leviathans are up to (after all, it isn't the season finale yet...).

1427215006|5.0|OMG this has been one of my all time favorites so far this year! I completely fell in love with Cinder's story and what a unique story it was. I just loved the fairy tale retelling.  Cinder made me laugh and at times I wanted to cry and be so very angry. The ending was sort of bittersweet leaving me feeling sad because of the way things were left with Prince Kai and I cant wait for the next installment of Cinder so I can see The Lunar Queen get hers because she does have it coming that's for sure!  She is so mean and vindictive..almost could be a sister to Cinder's stepmother! She is just being so unreasonable.<br /><br />Cinder is a true Cinderella in my book as everybody she cares about has been taken from her at some point and time but she has the spirit and spunk of a warrior and I just know she is going to come back all systems blazing and kick some serious butt in the next book and I will be right there front row and center to cheer her on!<br /><br />IN lieu of reading the book I listened to the CD version from Macmillan Audio and Rebecca Soler did a Fantastic job reading it! She had a separate tone/voice for each character and her voice was not dull like some audio's I've listened to. Thanks again MacMillan!
B002QW7AJY|5.0|This has to be the creepiest Sci-fi film since \\"Event Horizon\\". I found it to be quite original to me. Ben Foster is great in that he exudes raw aggravated attention, fear and determination. The dark and dungy ship succeeds in setting an even more ominous tone for the movie. Pandorum also has a quite satisfying ending too which is a relief after almost two hours of nail biting horror. The movie is very effective when watched alone very late at night in the dark.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is a definite improvement over the regular DVD. The picture is very much improved, and lots of details emerge in more highly lit scenes. Meanwhile, the audio is spectacular compared to the regular DVD version.<br /><br />The disc itself arrived on time- I have Prime. It was in a bubblepak  mailer envelope. When I first inserted the disc it loaded as expected and played, but there was no audio. I tried FFWD'ing and jumping chapters. I removed and inspected the disc; it looked pristine. I tried another Blu-Ray disc; it had audio fine. Finally, I cleaned the Pristine Pandorum disc anyway. That did the trick. It must of had some post manufacturing film or such on it. As always, Amazon had an unbeatable price.<br /><br />Pandorum was set up for a sequel and a prequel, but the movie didn't do great at the box office. So, if you would like to see a sequel, visit Pandorums Facebook page and Like it. Alvart says they'll do the sequel if enough people do.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|What can I say?  It works exactly as advertised.  Very easy to set up and use.  As others have said, it's not encrypted, so don't enter any passwords or anything when using over the Internet.  Only real con is that it doesn't seem to support wake on lan for the computer - it'd be nice to be able to leave my desktop off and still be able to access it from the road.  Nevertheless, it's the only remote desktop app I've seen that is so fast and easy to use, and it's one of the cheapest to boot!
B0050CQY1W|2.0|Beyonce is one of the few class acts left in the dying music industry. She's been in the game for over 10 years and is even hailed as an icon. I think we are getting ahead of ourselves. Yes, her voice moves mountains and she can gyrate on stage like she's the second coming of christ, but her music leaves me cold! What has beyonce done to reinvent the wheel? Her solo career is one lost opportunity after another. While I appreciate the much needed positive outlook displayed on this album, that's about where the fun stops. Before the release of the album, it was rumored that beyonce was inspired this time around by indie pop, the band Of Montreal for instance. So it was such a letdown to hear the first single, which is nothing more than a rip of a major lazer song! Girls (who run the world) might be fun and all but it won't put you in the history books, my dear. The second single was written by Babyface, and it sounds like something that would play during the credits to a Hilary Duff movie. For those of you that are a little slow, that isn't a compliment. Party might sound promising but excuse me, where is the melody? 1+1 equals a perfect replacement for nyquil, as it will surely put you to sleep. Love on Top is a bit overblown, but her vocal performance saves the day.<br /><br />I encourage Beyonce to think outside the box. She is signed to a major label and considering how hard it is to move records these days, it's no wonder Beyonce choose to crank out something reliable instead of something risque. But this is her fourth album as a solo artist. How about booking some time with hercules and love affair, and cutting some house tunes? For those soul tracks, get Quincy Jones out of retirement. Instead, she works with the same played out producers. Stop talking about running the world and do it, already!

0385344228|4.0|This novel reminds me of Scott Turow's classic PRESUMED INNOCENT.  That novel was also written in the first person but Turow wisely avoided the perils of that point of view.  The main peril is for the main character to ruminate too much in his head about what is going on in the narrative, e.g. \\"if only i could have known then...\\"  This book is chocked full of this problem.  Repetition is another problem with first person which Turow avoided but this author does not.  I wanted to hit him over the  head at certain points as he regaled me with the tenth reminder of some clue or point.  This, of course, throws the pace off and results in dragging.<br /><br />These are writing flaws though which a really good editor should have been able to fix.  It is a pity the author did not have such a superior professional.  Because despite these flaws it is a heck of an idea. Most of these legal thrillers go over the same well trod ground in book after book, never carving out new territory to engage our interest.  This novel, however, tells us very quickly after the son is accused of the murder that the father has a long line of murderers in their genetic line.  Thus, they may all have the murder gene which could be used as a partial defense to drop the conviction down to manslaughter if the murder trial starts going south.  I was hooked from the moment I heard that phrase \\"murder gene\\" and the family began meeting with both the psychiatrist and the lawyer to work with that defense.<br /><br />If the writer can get an excellent editor for his second book, I think that one will get the full five stars.  The publisher should not be short changing this author.  He is worth the financial outlay.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

My husband disliked this book most out of all of the series, because it ended silly in his opinion. In MY opinion, she ended it in good form. Moning pulled a bait and switch on us- she led us to think one thing (that really WOULD have been silly and ridiculous and implausible for an ending/explanation) so that when presented with the \\"truth\\" of MacKayla's history, I was relieved that it wasn't the first supposition.<br /><br />Well written, exciting, fast paced and just delicious to read.

I think it is really close to how the book was.  And I really enjoy BBC television.  If anyone is a Jane Austen fan, read the book first and then watch this movie.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

B000Y7U98W|5.0|This movie is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. It is visually stunning. I loved the story line. The music was moving. This movie evoked such an emotional response from me that I was surprised.<br /><br />I understand the movie may be slow for some. I think introspection was the goal of this movie. Moral dilemmas come up and the different characters obviously react differently, making you wonder how you would respond. Not everything is explained and many questions are left unanswered, leaving you to search for your own answers. I believe all this was done on purpose and made the movie that much better.<br /><br />After reading some reviews that criticized the science of the movie, I have to say- some things, you just have to accept. Is the science all based in fact? Of course not. Why is the sun dying? It doesn't really matter; it is not relevant to the plot but rather only a backdrop. If these types of details bother you and distract you from enjoying a movie, then you should pass.

B006OAB2XO|4.0|I'm not going to do a song-by-song review or anything, but I cannot stop listening to this album. So many excellent songs. Genesis & Oblivion start the album off on a great note after a short intro, and then just wait until Circumambient! A highlight of the year so far.<br /><br />Update: After listening to it extensively on (legal) streaming, I decided to go ahead and buy a physical copy on CD, especially after someone said the packaging was great. I'm extremely disappointed, as the packaging is completely barebones. No insert, no lyrics, just a digipak and the physical disk. I'm somewhat glad I bought it because it lets me support the artist a little more directly, but this is not how you package a CD if you're trying to get people to still buy physical media.<br /><br />Music: 5 stars<br />Actual CD of Visions: 1.5 stars
B000W91RUG|5.0|The package was sent in a timely manner and was in great condition!  No complaints here.  Thoroughly enjoyed the first season!  So much so, that we bought the second season the next week.
0061649694|5.0|Also appears on The Screaming Nitpicker.<br /><br />Coraline the movie is one of my all-time favorite movies. There is no need for me to argue it. One of the few good things my brother's then-girlfriend did for me was to make me sit down with her and my brother to watch the movie. I'm not a huge fan of Dakota Fanning, but I thought she was fantastic while voicing Coraline and both the animation and plot of the movie wowed me. After that fantastic cinematic experience, I wanted so badly to read the book, but I had such trouble finding it in stores. Now I have my own copy to cherish and I won't be letting it go anytime soon.<br /><br />At first, I found the writing a little simplistic even for a children's book. She did this, he did this, she did this, she said this or that--I like it when a book is direct, but there is a difference between that and telling us everything instead of showing it. As I kept reading and saw Coraline make statements like this:<br /><br />  Coraline sighed. \\"You really don't understand, do you?\\" she said. \\"I don't want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted? Just like that, and it didn't mean anything. What then?\\"  (Coraline, p. 120)<br /><br />I realized the book was not simplistically written; it was merely understated. Some sage words of wisdom are in these pages (one piece in particular is especially relevant to another book I am reading right now) and the choice to keep the novel so sparsely described lets the truly extraordinary moments and phrases of Coraline's shine.<br /><br />The other mother is a thoroughly creepy character and I love her for it. My friends may or may not share this opinion, but it is often the creepiest characters in a novel that I love the most. Wait, I should revise that because I don't love all creepy characters (the idea of me even tolerating the creeptastic Patch Cipriano of Hush, Hush fame and similar characters is both laughable and frightening). I love the creeps that are not romanticized and are allowed to shine in all their creepy glory. When it is shown as it is, I find it interesting; when it is romanticized and I know it most certainly should not be, I find it infuriating. The other mother ends up on the good side.<br /><br />(And that was me seeing how many times I could say creepy or some variation of it before it stopped sounding like a word anymore. It still sounds like one, so I haven't used it nearly enough. I'll do better next time!)<br /><br />In a way, my love for both the movie and the book is affected by nostalgia for a long-lost time. Being able to sit on the top bunk of my brother's bed, watch a movie, and feel like nothing bad could happen--I'll never have that back. My brother and his girlfriend broke up; the bunk bed was later broken during a home invasion that has become one of the defining moments of my life due to the trauma. Coraline takes me back to a time where I could sit on the ancient, creaking bunk bed and feel safe. Two and a half years of fear, paranoia, and the inability to feel safe is a very long time indeed.<br /><br />So should you read Coraline? Yes. I don't hand out five-star ratings lightly these days and this book deserves one. For the echo of safety it can take me back to and its subtle charm, I love it.ghtening).

B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you found \\"1984\\" a good read, \\"Hunger Games\\" takes a different but more realistic approach to the future of civilization. The book caused me to believe that ancient Rome had continued into a future society where gladiator-like games are played in tribute to a central dictatorial government.  The privileged citizens are immune to the required tribute but are able to \\"enjoy\\" the death games and treat them as our current society treats watching a football game (including betting).<br /><br />The characters are richly developed into believable people with different motivations to achieve victory.  There is enough detail created about their lives without creating long boring passages.  The end of the book is only the beginning of the second in the trilogy, and it left me with the need to immediately download the second book to continue the saga.  In my opinion, this is a MUST read for most ages (13 & up).

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Admittedly, the Blu-Ray is one of those that pretty much strips the package to its cheapest of cores.  That is to say there are hardly any extras, the digital copy is the strange-yet-intriguing \\"ultraviolet\\" digital copy, and the extras are low on my interests.  I was also thinking it'd been cool if they would have given some artistic vibe to the cover.<br /><br />The five star rating is solely due to the content.  I'm guessing that's why they skimped on the other coolness features (they should never skimp).  This movie was brilliant; violent but brilliant.  The director and cinematographer pulled off some beautiful camera work.  Though the action scenes, by some standards, were few and far between, I haven't seen them shot as beautifully and precisely as they were in Drive.  People have complained about the lack of talking between the main characters but I think the way they pulled off the scenes were more consistent with the film on a emotional level.  I think moviegoers have become attuned to certain type of movie, a bad type of film where they need constant stimulation regardless of how its being presented.  This movie breaks that mold.  The movie goes with the days of fine filmmaking.  This movie creates a story of a mysterious driver whose life's purpose is to be a good guy when everything around him suggests otherwise.  It has heart.
B005FQE2E4|5.0|This book was great. It was funny and made good entertainment for my friends and I. Imagine a bunny, a box of razor blades, and a vacuum. Now imagine the bunny turning on the vacuum, dropping in the blades, and letting himself gets sucked up. That is this books kind of humor. There is no gore so no need to glare at me and think &#34;Are you a phyco?&#34; Nope its just good clean fun. With bunnies. My only wish is that it would be longer as I finished in under half an hour.<br />I cant wait until more are made!
B003HC9KKE|5.0|but if people say the sound quality of this edition is bad, I will believe it.  One thing I haven't read from glances of reviews is that nobody mentioned that a song is missing.  If the track listing is correct for this edition, then \\"Can't find me a thrill\\" is missing. One of the best and hardest rocking songs on the whole album.  What's up with that?!?!?

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Entertaining game that keeps me occupied when nothing else to do, especially when sitting around the airport. I recommend it.
0307959856|1.0|I bought this book because I thought that P.D. James could revisit my beloved Pride and Prejudice with a mystery interwoven with the characters whom I've loved.<br />What a disappointment!<br />Spoiler Alert!  Not only did Ms. James compose a convoluted plot that was, in itself, a disappointment and a boring read, but she also portrayed Darcy and Elizabeth as flat characters who were a virtual footnote to the story.<br />As if it weren't bad enough that Ms. James trespassed on Pemberley, but she had the audacity to end the novel, in part, by bringing Emma and Mr. Knightly into this unfortunate mess!<br />Jane Austen must be \\"turning in her grave!\\"<br />Not recommended for those who want to remember the grace and charm of Miss Austen's works!
B004APVI1G|3.0|This is one of the better looking 3D blu rays, but the story just wasn't very captivating. It didn't hold my 4 year old's attention past the first 15 minutes and I had to fight to stay awake later on to finish it. I enjoyed the extras that I did watch. I'm sure that if I had read the source material I would appreciate the movie more, but as it stands it's just an okay movie that's only worth watching for the gorgeous visuals.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Again, this series kept me reading because the writing is really good. The biggest problem I have with this book is the plot. Yes, it's fiction, but please. 11 year old kids fighting to the death. I just don't know what good this will do for our next generation. But anway, I give it 2 stars as she is a really good writer regardless.
B0045MQCGK|4.0|This series takes allloooooooong time to get going, but starts to payoff at about episode 6. I was watching this part time, on and off, then after six I became pretty interested. If you stick with it, it will eventually be worthwhile. Wait for it....wait....wait.....BINGO!<br /><br />There is even a Lexx cameo in the next to the last episode. :)
B00062PN6I|4.0|Let me start off by saying these may not be the best choice for studio monitoring. Having said that, these are hard to beat for the price!<br /><br />Compared to the AKG K240 'phones I use for studio work, the bass on the Behringer HPM 1000 is a little boomy, but not totally overpowering. Midrange seem to be happening right in the middle of my skull, so you may need to adjust your volume down a little from where you usually listen. Other than the previously noted bass boost, the overall tone of these headphones is sweet. Fit is a little sung, but not headache tight, but that may loosen over time. For now, the ear cups do a good job of reducing background noise, but these are not noise canceling.<br /><br />I plan on using these for daily use with a portable music player. There are better headphones out there, but on a price / performance basis I don't think these can be beat. At the prices these are available for, be sure to pick up a spare pair!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Got this game as a free app of the day and must say that it is a great game.  If you're contemplating whether to buy it, I'd say go for it!  You won't be disappointed.  You'll probably find that you can't stop playing as it is an adventure as you play.

Only had to push three times, total labor less than six hours. He came out so fast that the nurses couldn't get me out of triage, and I wasn't able to make it to a full size bed *^_^ Talk about working WITH your own body. Awesome. I even amazed the nurses. My now almost three-year-old is a happy, and surprisingly calm person. I recommend this book whole-heartly.

B005QUQP76|3.0|** Info as of 2/10/13<br />Still 3 stars but for different reasons.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago IE started to scroll \\"on its own\\". A week later it became clear that the mouse wheel was reporting use when there was none and none when there was some. Tried blowing it clean . . . no change, the scroll wheel was no longer functional. Emailed Corsair and they said to file for an RMA.<br /><br />In the meantime, I really need the levels of dpi control this mouse provides for use in World of Tanks, WoW, and photo editing. So I found myself in the odd position of buying a new one (M65) to use while the \\"old\\" M60 is sent to Corsair for r/r under the 2 year warranty.<br /><br />As of this date the software and mouse documentation has improved significantly. It still must be downloaded, but that alone is no big deal and probably the right way to go to avoid old software in the box.<br /><br />My rating would change to 5 stars if the M60 had not broken after 1 year of reasonable use. So it remains at 3 stars. YMMV.<br /><br />** Info as of 2/28/12<br /><br />I've used Logitech and Ideazon/SteelSeries mice, keyboards, keypads, headsets and programmed their macro keys with gaming and utility macros for many years. Here's my ratings/rationale for the components of the M60 mouse:<br /><br />Hardware: 5 stars<br /><br />The hardware is sleek, elegant, and exhibits excellent build quality. It's really quite nice and these features are adequately covered in other reviews here<br /><br />Software: 3 stars<br /><br />The software actually provides some new capabilities in macro programming, and new features such as the ability to test the surface your mouse rides on to show you how well the mouse can sense movement.<br /><br />However, the software is neither provided (you must download it) nor intuitive. Worse, NO documentation is provided, not even within the software zip file download package. There is no Help, no tool tips, and the \\"Help\\" function in the software brings you toa web page that is nothing more than an FAQ for all of the Vengeance keyboards and mice. In the FAQ the only M60-relevant question is \\"Can all of the M60/90 keys be reprogrammed?\\" The answer given is \\"Yes, with the software provided\\". I really did laugh out loud :)<br /><br />In order to program a key for (eg) a Ventrilo PTT key (I use \\"~\\") you actually must:<br /><br />- Select the \\"Assign Buttons\\" Tab<br />- Click \\"Delay Options\\" and check box \\"Ignore Delays\\"<br />- Click \\"Playback Options\\"<br />- Click on the 3rd of four internationally icon'd option buttons (there is no tool tip on mouse hover, but it means \\"repeat while held\\")<br />- Click on \\"MR\\". It begins to blink.<br />- Click on a button number shown on the mouse picture to select the target button<br />- Press \\"~\\" on your keyboard\\"<br />- Click on MR to stop macro recording.<br />- Right click on the \\"Button Up\\" line in the macro, and choose \\"Delete\\" from the context menu.<br />- Click \\"Hardware PlaybacK\\" so the macro will run from the mouse, not from software.<br />- Select the \\"Manage Profiles\\" tab<br />- Click \\"Save to M60\\"<br /><br />It gets more complicated if you have multiple Profiles. While overall use of the software isn't impossible, it is very much impossible WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION.<br /><br />Documentation: 0 Stars<br /><br />No documentation is provided with the mouse, nor in the software download. I couldn't find an M60 manual online; the best I could find is an M90 User Manual that is very useful (actually indispensable) as a stand-in.<br /><br />Overall Rating (at this time): 3 stars<br /><br />I bought this mouse for use in FPS games specifically for a couple of macros and the \\"Sniper\\" button. I really like it, and the software is really very powerful. But I'd advise you not to buy this mouse AT THIS TIME if you are easily frustrated.<br /><br />If you do decide to buy it, plug in your mouse first and then use your favorite search engine to find the Corsair Support Forums. Go to the Corsair Product Discussion/Keyboards and Mice section. There you will find \\"Sticky\\" posts for downloading the latest software, downloading the M90 Manual, and Setting up voice chat with M60/M90. (The voice chat post is worth reading even if you do not use voice chat because it shows you how to accomplish some things in macros you might not ever figure out on your own :) )<br /><br />Then dl/install the software, and begin the learning process. You *will* enjoy the mouse, and I'm sure Corsair will get things right over time.
0545425115|5.0|Although I'm an adult, I read and enjoy a lot of science fiction, including Young Adult sci-fi, and I initially picked this up for that reason. However, as I was reading it, another school shooting was covered on the news, and it definitely impacted my reaction to this book. As is probably well-known by now, the plot of The Hunger Games revolves around a post-apocalyptic society in which 12 districts are pitted against each other by 'the Capital'. One of the ways the Capital keeps the 12 districts from bonding in order to rebel is by annually sponsoring the 'Hunger Games', in which 1 boy and 1 girl, ages 12-18, are chosen in a lottery each year to compete to the death. The survivor is crowned champion and it benefits the entire district. The heroine of this book is Katniss Everdeen, who is forced to fight in the Hunger Games for District 12.<br /><br />The plot is brutal, covering the grisly deaths of contestant after contestant, and some have questioned the value of a book in which teens are killing each other. But like the best science fiction, this book isn't about the violence - the violence is a way of getting the reader to look at oppression, the ways control is exerted through the media and other forces, and who benefits when groups are pitted against each other. Katniss is a smart survivor, and leads us through her own realizations about these topics as the book progresses. She is also distinguished from many of the other characters in this book by her empathy. So while this book is brutal, I feel the value of the questions it ask about violence, and how it comes about, far outweigh any negatives. An excellent book that deserves the praise it has received, and I look forward to reading the others in the series.

B005F3XV62|2.0|Talking animals are usually a sure hit with my kids, and I generally like Kevin James and his affable humor. But we were just too bored with this one. James plays the zookeeper of the title, with serious romantic problems, and a zoo full of animals that he finds out can talk and decide to try and coach him through his romantic woes. There are a few funny moment - a favorite was when he takes the gorilla to TGI Fridays - but mostly it's just a bit too slow. Having the plot revolve around adult romantic issues also just didn't work - talking animal movies are usually skewed to a young crowd (my own are 5 and 7), but they just don't get some of the romance/mating related jokes. So unfortunately, I think this one was a miss.

B004QIG7CW|4.0|This is one of the most recent Disney musical movies, ala High School Musical and Camp Rock. This one centers on 5 high schoolers - 2 girls and 3 boys - that meet up in detention (all for minor infractions or misunderstandings), and end up forming a band. The way the band forms, and their instant musical chemistry, completely defies reality, but that's musicals for you. They end up competing against an existing popular high school band, and have to fight through the usual doubts and ostracization, as well as each having parental difficulties to overcome. As is typical in these movies, most of the adults are either cruel or clueless or both, which always bothers me a bit, but of course this is how tweens and teens often view adults, so that's partly a play to the target demographic. I do wish Disney would consider including some truly kind, engaged, insightful adults, so there was some model of kids turning to adults for help with their problems, but that may be too much to ask (it's one of the reasons I gave this 4 rather than 5 stars however.)<br /><br />The music is more rock than others, and there is a 'question authority/stand up for what's right' theme that some parents might object too, although I personally felt it was handled fine. But other than that this is a fun, upbeat tween musical with engaging characters and music.

1439170916|5.0|The book puts cancer in a lot of contexts: within the development of medicine over the last 200 years; scientific knowledge of how cancer operates and treatments that have responded/lagged re: that knowledge; and how medicine views the patient including caring/not caring about devastating side effects and death with dignity.  Useful read for anyone touched by this disease which pretty much means all of us.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Just wanted to let people know that if you're thinking of getting the DVD from the UK site, DON'T! I was very close to ordering from there, but when I researched it, it seems you can only watch Blu-Ray from there. The DVDs are NOT region-free. I don't have a Blu-Ray player, so this means something to me.<br /><br />Having said that, I have to add that I HATE the \\"free shipping\\" that's offered now. It takes pretty close to two weeks to get anything from Amazon that way, and I've noticed they keep sending my things to a FedEx place on the other side of my state and letting it sit for a few days. Oh, and that's after they wait a few days to ship it out to begin with. It's almost worth it to pay the extra for faster shipping. This is where the one-less star comes in.<br /><br />I was happy to see that when I bought this DVD that I also got a free one-month rental to watch it on my streaming device, so I did get to watch it before it arrived (it's supposed to be here tomorrow). I plan on giving this one to a friend and keeping the digital copy (if I can get it to work), so that just makes me more anxious to get it....<br /><br />To end: I LOVE this movie, and all the others in this series, so I guess it's worth a little patience, considering Walmart sent all their copies back (dumb!).

0307888908|5.0|\\"The Start-up of You\\" by Reid Hoffman (co-founder of LinkedIn) and Ben Casnocha is an excellent book to motivate and inspire you to take charge and accountability of your professional career. The authors intertwine interesting historical references and extensive personal experiences to provide a roadmap to transforming your career.<br /><br />The book begins with a reality check and reminder that the former paradigms we may have had of the \\"American Dream\\" and \\"traditional career\\" assumptions have been gradually shattered over the past several decades. The old adage about \\"ready, aim, fire\\" has been supplanted with \\"aim, fire, aim, fire, aim, fire, ...\\" to survive and sustain our professional careers. The authors state their case that we should define our \\"assets\\", \\"aspirations and values\\", and the \\"market realities\\" of the world we live in to identify your specific competitive advantage as you formulate your professional career.<br /><br />Reid and Ben also provide dozens of illustrations throughout the book on why so many entrepreneurial businesses launched in the Silicon Valley in California have been success. The professional networking that occurs in that region is likely unsurpassed in any business community throughout the world.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"The Start-up of You\\" to anyone who is at a crossroads in their professional career or any professional who is looking to unleash their entrepreneurial spirit that has been squelched and smothered inside you for far too long.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was an early adopter and continue to be a fan of the professional networking site, LinkedIn. I found this platform to be an essential professional networking tool in the various businesses I have run over the past decade.
1849025940|2.0|George's Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London is no doubt a well-written and interesting novel, suffering from some several flaws that hand over it like a miasma.  First and foremost, when the narrator refers to Jews, any Jew, he simply calls him \\"the Jew\\" as if that label says it all.  \\"The Jew\\" is nearly always devious, avaricious, and just plain unsavory.  Here is Orwell writing in the 1930s, catching the anti-Semitic wave that would end in freight trains and gas chambers.  Reading such passages mar this book deeply.  But to be fair, he often makes sweeping generalization about nationalities, especially those from the south and east of Europe, no doubt as unsavory and easy to characterize in one word like \\"the Pole\\" as is \\"the Jew.\\"<br /><br />When Orwell (or to be fair, his narrator) let's go of these concerns, the book takes off.  The best sections involve the restaurants in Paris.  There, events take care of themselves, and there is not the cool detachment and prejudice guiding the flow of events.<br /><br />But by the end, when the narrator joins homeless men in London,  the off putting detachment resumes, and we see the point of the novel.  The narrator is to become our inside man in the underbelly of society.  He is to show us how the men who live on tea and two slices exist.  He even has solutions to their plight! But the air of detachment and singular lack of connection and warmth toward these poor men make the observations he makes cold and cruel.  One gets the feeling Orwell's narrator cares as much about homeless men as the Jews.<br /><br />This book could ruin a young person  who reads it at the wrong time in their formative years, or in a bad frame of mind (I know of one example).  This novel romanticizes poverty.  It makes the difficulties of life all surface show.  There is nothing romantic about poverty.  It is a mean and difficult life.
B00005JLKN|3.0|There are some scary moments here and enough edgy characters to analyze.  Nothing new in the plot: an nutcase has brutally killed two families, with no apparent reason, so the FBI has to figure out his modus operandi in order to stop him. WHY does he choose these folks and murder them so brutally?  One plot flaw is that the movie never answers that question.  It answers HOW he locates them, but not why he wants to kill picture-book happy families, kids, dogs and all.<br />Fienne's villain is a tortured soul due to abuse from his mother as a child.  So who isnt?  Still, Fiennes is excellent at being chilling and weird. An  FBI agent, urged back into service is played by Edward Norton who is compelled to stop Fiennes once he has seen the horrible deaths inflicted on the murdered families. Norton is miscast here.  He could have played the villain's role well, but as the squeaky clean agent with a nerdy voice, he drags the film down.  Hopkins contributes a little of his branded creepiness when Norton consults him on the case, just as Agent Starling did in the sequel. He oozes his oily, threatening demeanor pretty well, but the role is not as well-written for him as in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".  Phillip Hoffman is a slimy newspaper hack for a tabloid and is actually the most interesting character after Fiennes.  Unlike \\"Silence\\", I knew exactly how this plot was going to play out, still it was worth a look to see excellent actors give it a go.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|It is difficult to find books based on the paranormal and with romantic undertones that are done fully and not dredging up the same old same old.  There is a lot to like in Rebecca Hamilton's new series: magic, transformations, sci-fi undertones, myth and legends.  But the real prize is the small touches in the writing itself that show care and time spent developing the storyline.  I was nervous beginning this book.  I'd been burnt a lot recently on my choices, but a third of the way in I found I was relaxed and so absorbed in the writing that I didn't notice the time going by (unusual for me).<br /><br />I took a star off only because there were a few awkward spots in the story line (the plot was solid, but sometimes things moved in a strange direction although it seemed to make sense later).  My guess is it is a new writer thing that will work itself out over time (and it wasn't that big of a deal to begin with).<br /><br />One more thing I will mention is the main character is a very likable character.  She is someone you can easily identify with and root for.<br /><br />So go do yourself a favor and go buy this book!<br /><br />I should mention I received this copy as a free gift from Amazon and the author, but I knew nothing of the author before I received the book.

0307592731|2.0|I wish I had read some of the book myself before offering it to my teen son to read. He gave the book back to me rather quickly and after reading some of it myself, I am glad he did. The morals discussed in the book where rather disappointing to say the least and upsetting as it was unexpected. I was not anticipating the author's gross discriptions of wanting to have sex with her dying mother's male nurse and what she imagined his penis would feel like. That does not cover the rest of her affairs, her pot smoking, heroin use, or hitchhiking. If that is what you are looking for, it is a great story but I found it increadibly disappointing. Not recommended for anyone younger than adult due to disturbing content.
006197806X|5.0|First Impressions: If you have read my review of Delirium, you know that it was my favorite book of 2011, at least, until I read Pandemonium. In hindsight, I wish I had waited to read it closer to its release date because now I have to wait over a year to find out how the story is going to end. It is going to drive me absolutely insane! But, it was sitting in my To-Read pile calling my name and begging to be read. I couldn't resist, so I picked up the book and immersed myself once again in this crazy world Lauren Oliver created. I also really like the cover art on Pandemonium. I'm not sure if I like it more than the cover art on the first book, but it is still really pretty!<br /><br />First 50 Pages: Wow! Now here is where I have to give my warning that this review is going to contain some spoilers. This review would be near-to-impossible to write without giving anything away. I'm sorry everyone! I hate spoilers as much as the next person but it has to be done. I'll try to give away as little as possible.<br /><br />Okay, with that being said, I had predicted that Pandemonium would contain a lot more action then Delirium. I was spot on the money with that! This book is so action packed that it the pages just seemed to fly on by. The book is set up differently than Delirium. The chapters alternate between the past (what Lena encountered after her botched escape into the Wilds) and the present, what is happening to Lena after a certain point in the story. The book begins with the present, a Lena with a fake procedure mark on her neck sitting in a brand new school, in a new regulated city (Manhattan), and a new fake name. Then in the next chapter, we switch to what happened directly after Lena made her escape into the Wilds and how she survived that crazy ordeal without Alex.<br /><br />Characters & Plot: Lena has completely changed in this story. It is true that the old Lena is basically dead. She is reborn in the Wilds as a strong, kick-butt female character that has what it takes to make it through just about everything. The old Lena that couldn't take care of herself and was scared all of the time is gone. I love the new Lena! She has her moments where she feels like everything will collapse around her, but she pushes through and overcomes her obstacles. Adjusting to live in the Wilds was very difficult for her, and loosing Alex, who she believes is dead, seems like something she just can't get past or is able to deal with. Yet, she finds a way to survive with the help of a few new characters.<br /><br />Raven, who is the leader. She is the one who nurses Lena back to good health after Raven's make-shift family finds her half-dead in the Wilds near their summer encampment, miles and miles away from Portland where Lena originally entered the Wilds. There is also Blue, who is kind of a daughter to Raven, and Tack, a stern no-nonsense sort of character who doesn't ever really warm-up to Lena. There is also Hunter, a sweet guy who treats Lena with more kindness then most of the other characters in this group. Raven and Blue have very mysterious pasts that nobody seems to want to share with Lena, even though she asks a few times. Their pasts are revealed late into the story, and they are unbelievably heartbreaking!<br /><br />When we reach the present parts of the story, Lena is working with Raven and Tack undercover in Manhattan, trying to gather as much information as they can about the DFA. These are the people who believe in the Cure and are trying to get younger people to have the Procedure, even if it means risking their lives to be free of love. The head of the DFA has a son named Julian, who at a massive rally in Times Square, Lena is told to keep an eye on no matter what. This is when crap really hits the fan, and Lena and Julian are captured by unknown people.<br /><br />During their time being held prisoners, for what reason they don't really know, they try to get to know each other. Lena tries to uphold her false identity in front of Julian, but in the end, she tells him everything he knows about her is a lie. Now, Julian is an interesting character. He starts out as believing in the Cure and is very much like how Lena use to be before she met and fell in love with Alex. Julian had tumors in his brain and has undergone a few surgeries over his life and was willing to undergo the Procedure to protect him against love, even though the doctors told him and his family the Procedure would probably kill him. All of this starts to break down while he is being held captive and Julian's true emotions start to pour out. I felt very bad for this character. The story of his life isn't all that it appeared to be.<br /><br />Lena and Julian do end up escaping and find their way back to Raven and Tack... and even more craziness starts to happen. I don't want to give away any more spoilers. I've spoiled enough. What happens next in this book is high drama, multiple fights for survival, lies being uncovered, and a new love being born. It is all incredibly emotional and Lauren Oliver really outdid herself this time when it comes to her writing. Talk about being able to create suspense! This book is full of it!<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Excuse me while I yell at Ms. Oliver..... OMG! How could you end the book RIGHT THERE?? Are you trying to give me a heart attack?<br /><br />Anyway, the book ends with a major, major cliffhanger. Alex makes an appearance on the very last page. He doesn't sound at all happy either, but who can blame him? Say hello to a love triangle about to be born, but we will have to wait until the next book for all of that.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was better than I could ever hope it would be. It was ten times better than Delirium was and that is quite an accomplishment! I don't even know which boy to root for now! Julian or Alex.... I really don't know! I love each one for different reasons, but I think I would prefer Lena to end up with Alex. There is just something special about him that I can't shake. Oh my... Please, please pick up this book when it is released in March next year! If you haven't read Delirium, do it!

0062082353|2.0|I'm going to state right off the bat that I did not know a great deal about Navy SEALs prior to reading this book. I learned quite a bit more about them thanks to this book. It definitely takes a person of a certain type to be able to go through all of the training to become a SEAL. I can't really imagine being subjected to the type of abuse and beating the prospective SEALs have to endure in training camp. But I understand why they are subjected to it. You cannot have elite soldiers who cannot handle extreme adverse conditions. Chris Kyle does a good job of running through all of his experiences so readers can hopefully come to the conclusion that becoming a SEAL is not a walk in the park.<br /><br />One of the nice things about this book is it gives a perspective of what it is like being on the ground in Iraq during the 2003-2008(9) period. I've read many media accounts of the situation in Iraq, but never anything regarding to a soldier's perspective. The book's biggest strength comes during Kyle's narrative in this period...yet at the same time it happens to be one of the biggest weaknesses of this book.<br /><br />If you are looking for any honest assessment of the psychological effect war has on a soldier, this book will not give it. Chris Kyle's narrative is one of a very testosterone driven nature. He makes the whole idea of going over to Iraq, and being involved in combat situations where he is killing people as a big game. It shows in his writing because you can get a sense that he gets extremely excited when talking about how many Iraqi insurgents he killed, or how he killed them. There seems to be little attention paid on his part to how it changes a person. I would argue that his ability to be introspective is not particularly strong. At points it almost feels like he is going to open up more to talk about different things that are very real problems with soldiers who came back from Iraq. Then he just speeds on past without explaining things any further.There was a part where he discusses the effects of driving in traffic in California, as well as a burglar alarm going off at home. It sounded like there was some PTSD involved in those situations. But, he blows it off. One cannot help but get the feeling that throughout the book that he is attempting to build up a sort of \\"macho\\" image for everyone reading the book. It doesn't do any favors to most soldiers. I understand it is his own autobiography and that he is going to see things from his own perspective. When he includes passages of family members noticing a change in his personality from before the war to after the war, he missed the opportunity to expand on this. He briefly mentions a drinking problem that he got over after he came back for good.<br /><br />I can't help but question if this reluctance to delve into the true effects of the war on him is indicative of what the military culture is at large. If that is the case, then one could argue that it shouldn't be of surprise to the public when many veterans come back with psychological problems. I feel the book's greatest strength lies in not what Chris Kyle tells the reader, but what is left unsaid to the reader.<br /><br />It's a very easy read that likely will be enjoyable to many. My low score for it is not because I hated the book in any sense, but because I felt like it missed too many opportunities to be a standout title among military memoirs.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|Viewing it with HD and full sound, it was almost like being there.  For the most part, the cast was awesome.  I would reccommend it to anybody who has seen the Musical multiple times as I have.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I was a little hesitant to get this app because of the price (although even $6 isn't much) but I wanted to use my google calendar on my kindle fire and the other calendar apps didn't seem to offer enough.  That plus the good reviews made me buy it, I'm glad I did.  It perfectly replicates the google calendar, it looks great on the fire and it is easy to edit, so I don't know what that one low review was about.  Plus, I had a sync problem and emailed the developer, less than 12 hours later he replied.  I don't get that kind of service with Photoshop and it costs 100 times more than calengoo.  It is worth the money.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is an outstanding novel,I started it on Sunday and finished it on Monday.  The question of inherited \\"bad genes\\" is an old and interesting one.  I do not believe in \\"bad blood\\", however I do believe that psychopaths abe born, not made, and that there is little that can be done for them.  This book saddened me because I have experienced,first hand,the effect a psychopathic personality can have on a family.<br /><br />Teenagers are difficult, especially in this day and age, but there is a line past which normal becomes pathological and we do need to be vigilant. This novel was not off the wall but very real and possible, this book could be a case study.  GREAT READ!!!
B000002C4J|2.0|I got the vibe that this album, of her pre A NEW DAY HAS COME period albums, is the safest possible corporate easy listening/adult contemporary, meaning it was packaged as the absolutely blandest and therefore widest possible/safest taste.  Which makes it very bad.  Not Nimoyian or Shatnerian BAD, just VERY bad.  To use a term from Joseph Lanza's book, ELEVATOR MUSIC (very informative and a good introduction to easy listening music), this album for the most part is aural wallpaper.  It's expertly crafted, but that, I find, is it's greatest weakness, though I want to use stronger words.  The hits, which play on a somewhat depressing or schmaltzy sentimentality, work the best on this album, hence my two stars.  I actually very much enjoy \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" but it and this whole album allude strongly to an updated take on Debby Boone's YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE album (I have no problem with Ms. Boone, and she's not what I would file as one of my legitimate joke albums, a la David Hasselhoff's \\"straight\\" rockers).  \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is one of those bordering on terrible easy listening songs, like \\"You Light Up My Life,\\" \\"The Impossible Dream,\\" \\"My Way\\" (oh, PLEASE, CELINE, DO NOT COVER THAT SONG!  PEW!), \\"What a Wonderful World,\\" \\"Wind Beneath My Wings,\\" and \\"All By Myself,\\" which are adequate to decently listenable, but ONLY by the signature artist and no. one. else.  period.  Any other version is a joke, at best camp, cover tune and should not be done.  (Oh, oh, \\"All By Myself\\" ....)  The songs for the most part run the ...and the kitchen sink gauntlet of styles, with one awful, glaring contrived accent exception, \\"Treat Her Like a Lady,\\" which reaches out and strangles the listener with something strongly suggesting a pedigree going back to Robert Mitchum's Capitol CALYPSO IS LIKE SO album.

I didn't try the Cosi app because it seemed like it wanted access to everything and I wasn't comfortable with that.<br /><br />I have my calendar handy on my Kindle and the google calendar is always open on my desktop.  Its great and it isn't annoyingly slow like some web based apps.  I like the to do list online, but its not on the calengoo (at least not that I have found.

And I was expecting a smaller screen but it was a bit bigger than my notebook so... surprise there... So far, so good though, because you can also tell that it is not made from the highest quality materials. I guess time will tell. Just hope it doesn't break down before warranty (if it has any)... but for the initial use, you will really be satisfied with this gadget. I had to buy another ps3 just for traveling. the idea of being able to play anywhere, anytime as long as there is an outlet  near you will have you drooling for more travel time...
B005COO1X6|2.0|I have really never read any of his books but have seen movies so I was kind of excited that I was going to finally read one.  Once I started to read this I really was disappointed, it kept dragging you on thinking something was going to happen and then when it did it was a let down.  don't get me wrong I wanted to keep reading to find out what happens.  The end of the story could have used somethng else besides what happened, when I got to the end could not believe that was all there was.  Glad it was on $2.99 if it was more I would of been kicking myself.  Not sure I will get more King works???

B005ILYWN2|5.0|What a fun movie!<br /><br />Roughly shot to portray an amateur documentary feel.  It really puts the viewer in the shoes of the participants.  The movie is a cross between a realistic horror movie (of course you need to believe in trolls) and out right silly (in a thoroughly enjoyable way).<br /><br />It's well worth the time to watch!
0307949486|5.0|I picked up this book randomly at the library. I didn't know what it was about and I didn't bother reading the back of the book. I had heard a lot about the book so I decided to finally read it. I found this book amazing. I don't know why but I was hooked from the very beginning about could not stop reading until I finished the book. I plan to read the other books as well.<br />I think the characters were excellent and I think Salander and Blomkvist love story is a great touch. The whole reason Salander falls for Blomkvist is because he is so aloof and relaxed.<br />The whole \\"Harriet Vanger\\" was pretty predictable but I still found it a pretty decent story. The loved how the pieces of the puzzle led to more and more secrets. I think anyone who enjoys a good story will enjoy this one.

080214473X|5.0|This isn't just a book about war. This is a story about politics, culture and ultimately about people. Mark Bowden's non-fiction account of the battle of Mogadishu is used in military classes, but it doesn't read like a dry account of the battle. It reads like a novel. He uses dialog and internal monologue to paint vivid pictures of the people involved in the story. I've read and reread this book many times and each time I find it nearly impossible to put down.

0525478817|5.0|I finished reading \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" a couple of days ago, but the emotional resonance of the book is still strong. John Green's Hazel tells us from the outset that she is dying, but this book isn't about dying or even about cancer, though several of the characters have cancer. This book is about life and love. I found myself reading some parts with a throat tight from the effort not to bawl out loud, and then turning the page only to bark with laughter.<br /><br />I feel about this book the way Hazel and Gus feel about An Imperial Affliction. I almost don't want to tell people about it because it feels so intensely, personally mine. That's the thing about great literature, though, sharing it doesn't diminish your connection to it.<br /><br />Making it to the top of my favorite books list is not easy, but this book rocketed there. I want to read it again and again, but I need to wait. The emotions are still too raw right now.
B0078XM4SI|2.0|All it takes is to listen to the 30 second samples of each of these songs to realize that even after a hiatus for the band, there is nothing new here. The band plays the same sound of music over and over. The album sounds like their previous 3 albums. Inspired by the Rolling Stones here......I think I'll put Roses in the grave. I think this band should call it quits permanently.

That's when I don't really watch it but I watch it in my dream insted.<br /><br />So I had 3 or 4 budwisers and than went to bed.  Since the movie is black and white I dreamed it from like I was a dog because dogs see in black and white.  Since I was just watching I dont think it made a difference if I watched as a person or as a dog since the movie would be the same ether way.<br /><br />I give the movie 1 star because it was'nt very good in my dream.  What I rememmber was there was this guy in black and white and he had dark hair.  Then there was this girl in black and white to.  They spent most of there time driving a Hummer back and forth to church.  I'm not sure why.  The one thing I like was the guy had this awesom pistol collection hanging on the wall of the living room.  That was the best part.<br /><br />I think this review should get an Oscer to.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I have to admit I am a geek and I was a teenager and in my early 20s in the 1980s. This book has tons of references to the games that I played and the TV shows and movies I watched back then. The story was very enjoyable and I could hardly put it down.
B004FOA84A|4.0|if you get easily frustrated with mind puzzlers, this game is not for you. But if you are looking to spend an hour or so with good graphics, and brain teasers, you will enjoy a dollar's worth of entertainment. cheesy but cute ending, too.
1250004217|4.0|This book was very good but very sad.  The author did a great job of setting a tone by her style of writing.  I'm not sure that adding the romantic feelings of the main character added anything to the story but it didn't really hurt the story either.
B005P39GOI|4.0|Phenomenal album.  I've heard Ben compared to Nick Drake (whom I also love) but he has a sweeter element to his voice.  So glad he is getting exposure in the USA.  Hope to hear more from him soon.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Wished it didn't end so quickly. More challenging levels would have been great. Looking forward to the next one.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have this monster cooling my i7 2600k. I have the CPU overclocked to 4.2 and at idle it keeps the temperature around 35 Celsius. Under heavier load it might get into the 50's. I know someone who has a water cooled CPU cooler hooked up to an AMD 1100T 6 core and this fan keeps my CPU just as cool as his. Granted its a different chip, but it gives a little indication how well the Cooler Master 212 is working. Plus its a 1/3 the price of some of those water cooled CPU fans.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|A great album....so many songs,  so many artists.  Worth getting if you like Dylans music.  I loaded them on my ipod. Four Cds.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I believe this is the best CPU for the money right now. I've heard arguments between this and the 2500k, but the 2600k flat out hauls. I have it hooked up to an MSI board and is over clocked to 4.2 ghz with 16 GB of RAM. I ran some bench marks and it was getting numbers near 11,000. Intel has some other processors for $1,000 that have bench marks around 11,000 at stock speeds. Really the only processors faster are the new 6 core Intel's. You could pay $20 more for the 2700k get, but give you very little extra. If you have the money get this chip. There isn't one website that doesn't have this as a 5 star product.

006197806X|5.0|Do you guys remember how Delirium ended? Pretty freaking crazy, right? Definitely let me in shock and tears and with feelings of Noooooooooooooo!<br /><br />So luckily, Pandemonium sort of picks up right after that, except it switches back and forth between Then (the end of Delirium) and Now (what present-day Lena is doing). And this is super interesting because it sets us up with two different storylines that sort of converge into present day and explain everything. Well, explain as much as Lauren Oliver wants us to know.<br /><br />It's too hard for me to talk about the characters for several reasons. First off, I loved them all. I loved Lena and the new characters introduced - every single freaking one. The other reason is because I don't want to spoil anything! So let me just say, I love them all.<br /><br />The storyline is just as intense and riveting as Delirium, although there was one moment towards the end that had me going \\"whaaaaaat are you serious\\" in an...interesting way. It was just weird. But really, Pandemonium is a tale of survival and revenge and, of course, love.<br /><br />And guys, THE ENDING THE ENDING THE ENDING. Seriously Lauren Oliver, you had to do it AGAIN? These endings are killing me! My reaction to the ending was to gasp, reread, gasp, reread and then feaofjeoaifjeawopipejioafjeankxjvnj80wearuweaioj keyboard mash.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Delirium, you're going to love Pandemonium. It's an epic follow-up to an epic book and I seriously cannot wait until Requiem, which doesn't come out until freaking February 2013.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Now, I didn't see the theatrical version as it was bombarded with bad reviews. Not a single positive thing about the movie. I watched the extended version and well, I find the movie a total opposite of the reviews. Now, I'm not a GL fan, I'm a fan of movies that's well made, and this is one of them (extended cut). I didn't think it was rushed nor the SFX was cartoonish. Yes, I agree that it should have been a longer movie to get more action and character development but the movie was good enough on it's own pace. As usual, like the first Iron Man, there wasn't a lot of action scenes but still it was good. I'm getting this on BD.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|[[ASIN:B000M2O6AQ The Celestine Prophecy]]<br />It is a beautiful movie. There are not many movies that talk about energy and how it works. I have a copy of this movie for myself and I did purchase this one for my client.
B0009A21R6|5.0|I've been listening to Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler for over 25 years. \\"Brothers In Arms\\",is by far my favorite Dire Straits album and i would probably say it would be included in my choice of 10 all time favorite classic rock albums.The reason for this review isn't so much about the content of this classic gem as it is about the absolute fantastic reproduction of sound in the SACD 5.1 surround sound format. The quality of sound is so excellant, in my listening environment, it sounds like Mark Knopfler is there live.If you have the equipment to play this in SACD,and want the ultimate in listening experiences, i highly recomend buying it.
0439023513|2.0|The awesome story continues with even more excitment and edge of the seat stuff.  I really like the story as it so different than usual stories and because it could happen, it is realistic, especially the way the author writes it--it is almost as if she has lived it herself.  All of the underlying stories of each of the main characters the love triangle and how you think the love triangle will work out.  I had a friend who did not read the 3rd book as she had heard the ending was not good.  I read it anyway and while I loved the story up to the end, I agree that the ending was not what could have been a very uplifting end, it seemed to end with a down.  Up to that point, it was really good.  Maybe someday the author will come out with an alt-ending that is up-lifting.  But don't let that stop you, do like I did and read it.
1933633867|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm not in the social sciences, so if you want an erudite review of the concepts of the book, this ain't it. :)<br /><br />Economics has always been a fairly opaque subject for me (odd, considering that I have studied mathematics). However, sometimes when something is tough to understand, what you really need is a completely fresh view on the subject that you can sort of connect with mentally. After reading this book, stuff like money and the economy make a lot more sense to me (even though I still have a lot more to learn, of course).<br /><br />In general, I find that this is one of the main advantages of the book: it's an uncommon, in-depth look at a lot of things in our culture that are just sort of taken for granted, even if they're not completely understood. For example, the different levels of formality of debt; the way that it can be used to manage social relations; the way that various power structures can usurp the concept and turn it into something else - such concepts are examined in-depth, with historical examples, providing different ways of thinking about things that we all do.<br /><br />My only regret is that I can't really look at the book with a critical eye, as I'm not familiar with most of the history that it describes. But it was quite interesting seeing the historical connections that the author makes, for example, between people like Adam Smith, the society in which he lived, and middle-Eastern writers of centuries prior.<br /><br />Some reviewers say that they hang with the book until the last chapter, where the author puts too much of his own opinion into it (for example, suggesting that we try instituting a modern-day jubilee). Honestly, I would actually say that only about the last 10 pages (of a 50-page chapter) really get into the author's opinion - and the jubilee bit is practically a footnote at the end, so miniscule its mention. Most of the last chapter seemed to me to follow more or less directly from what had been developed earlier.<br /><br />My only nitpick is that the book is riddled with typos and such - not so much that it's unreadable, but there's probably at least one error for every 10-15 pages. It doesn't really affect the quality of the scholarship, but it was kind of annoying to see a final product with so much stuff that just needed a simple copy edit.

1400076943|5.0|adichie<br /><br />Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writes about life in Nigeria, Africa. The author specifically writes about two Igbo families. There is Kambili and JaJa. They are brother and sister. They live a prosperous life with their parents. Their parents are Catholic. The father, Eugene,  is very, very strict about his children not becoming heathens. Therefore, he doesn't allow the children to visit their grandfather or their aunt and her two children for long periods of time. This is very sad because Aunt Ifeoma longs for her son, Obiora,  and her daughter, Amaka, to experience a close relationship with one another. It is sad to read about religion used for hatred rather than love. When the children don't obey their very religious father, their punishment is very severe and unbelievable.<br /><br />\\"He lowered the kettle into the tub, tilted it toward my feet. He poured the hot water on my feet, slowly, as if he were conducting an experiment and wanted to see what would happen...The pain of contact was so pure, so scalding, I felt nothing for a second. And then I screamed.\\"<br /><br />The ending of the novel is a shock. I think the ending is also masterful.  The ending proves that the faults of other people have tentacles. These tentacles can kill or severely maim those within reach. I only had one problem with the novel. Kambili meets Father Amadi. She has a heavy crush on him. He seems to have the same feelings about her. I felt the relationship between Kambili and the Father went along too smoothly. It seemed to me the aunt should have been very, very upset about the Father putting aside his vows to look lustfully at her niece. No one seems upset about the situation.<br /><br />\\"Amaka laughed when Father Amadi asked her to come. \\"Don't try to be nice, Father, you know you would rather be alone with your sweetheart,\\" she said. And Father Amadi smiled and said nothing.\\"<br /><br />Still, the relationship between the two adds flavor to the novel. As did the political situations experienced by Aunt Ifeoma and her brother.  I also thought Purple Hibiscus was very rich because of the two different lifestyles of the families. Aunty Ifeoma is poor. There is an outside toilet. There are many worms crawling in the bath tub because the pipes are old and loose. There isn't always gas for the car. These conditions don't shape Aunty Ifeoma thoughts about people and life. Her hospitality is open handed. She loves to give and share what she owns with the people around her. I think this is the true spirit of Africans. The willingness to share with others no matter how hard their predicament. The Igbos remind me of the Purple Hibiscus. This flower doesn't like too much water. Neither does it like to be too dry. It likes a perfect balance. These two families were in search of that balance like any other people around the world. To find that balance doesn't come without struggle and heartache.<br /><br />\\"It was still harmattan and the earth was thirsty, but Aunty Ifeoma said the stalks might take root and grow if they were watered regularly, that hibiscuses didn't like too much water, but they didn't like to be too dry either.\\"cal situations experienced by Aunt Ifeoma and her brother.

0385342063|5.0|I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and while the female leads aren't particularly indistinguishable from each other, I've loved them all.  They're fun, light reads.  This one really made me laugh because it is indicative of the world we live in now.  The relationship between Sam and Poppy mostly takes place over texting.  Poppy is engaged to Magnus, who she met while working.  She'd only known him a month when he asked her to marry him so she really doesn't know him that well.  She feels inferior to him and his family because they're all scholarly and she feels she's not that smart.<br /><br />She meets Sam when she finds a phone that used to belong to his assistant and since she needs a phone, she keeps it. Sam and Poppy end up helping each other out. I really enjoyed the story and the characters.  Poppy's character was a lot of fun and so well meaning. The footnotes were somewhat annoying at first, but then I grew to enjoy them.<br /><br />I highly recommend all of Sophie Kinsella's books if you want a fun, light read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars because I couldn't put it down! It was beautifully written, if a bit repetitive at times. I'm going to be completely honest, there were a few things that bothered me, (as already mentioned many times by other reviewers), some of the overly repeated words: Obdurate!!! Harmonizes!!! Poundcake! Broom! I was also hoping for more on the yellow, orange, black, ocher, green card man/men. However, I'm still not entirely convinced that wasn't just more ingenious writing. I'm not going to over-analyze the fanciful plot or claim that Mr. King has some political agenda. It's just a fun, absorbing, fictitious book by one of the most adept imaginative writers of our time! It was fantastic and I loved it!

0375704027|1.0|A friend recommended this book to me after I had finished Ken Follet's \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", which was quite good. She had read both, and while she knew this book was a different flavor, she thought it may be an enjoyable read for me.<br /><br />I would like to preface the review with this: I tend to enjoy books with deep, complex plot lines that span generations (see: Clavell's \\"Shogun\\") while I tend to really dislike books with extremely weak and thin characters, and by weak I mean both poorly developed by the author as well as those characters who are just not strong (weaklings). A great example of such a novel would be Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", which I thought was just pathetic. I have no interest in reading 300 pages about some punk kid who can't deal with high school. \\"Norwegian Wood\\", for me, was far too similar to the latter.<br /><br />SPOILERS FOLLOW:<br /><br />We have a very nondescript Toru Watanabe as the main character who tells the story from the first person in Japan in 1969. The novel begins with Toru losing his best friend, Kizuki, to suicide in high school. Toru was the third wheel in a relationship between Kizuki and the young Naoko. This affects both Toru and Naoko heavily, although since the two of them weren't very close during this odd trio of a relationship, they never really talked about anything. They both end up in Tokyo the following year at college at different schools, through a series of extremely odd exchanges where they just walk around talk about virtually nothing, they have sex, and are somehow now all of a sudden in love. It is in this critical part of the book that I was already lost. First of all, the conversations between the characters are extremely DULL. Much of the plot is pushed forward by inner monologue, and that is just plain boring. There is virtually no action pushing this book forward. I was not at all invested, and didn't care about the well-being of any of the characters. Second, I just don't buy intothe story: a 19-year old kid who is having sex with lots of young women pokes his weirdo friend who happens to be his old-friend-who-committed-suicide's ex-girlfriend, and that's the girl he falls in love with? Ridiculous.<br /><br />Apparently after this encounter, which was Naoko's 20th birthday, she puts herself in a sanatorium up in Kyoto or something. Meanwhile, Toru is struggling with depression because...well, I don't really know why. He is apparently missing Naoko, even though their interactions with one another have not convinced me in the least that he should care. The development of this relationship is *critical* for the reader to be invested in the story at this point, and it was not well developed, so I thought this was just a waste of a ton of pages of Toru's thoughts. The one other thing I felt at this point in the book was that the story wasn't quite stupid enough. Thank God Murakami delivered us Midori, some psycho who of course comes with her own litany of problems to complicate matters even further. And the way he introduced to the book was just a subtle and clever as the rest of the prose up to this point: she sees him in a restaurant, introduces herself, and proceeds to start talking about random garbage, eventually (a few days later) inviting him to her place the following Sunday. For those of you without the mental acumen to discern from my recreation (almost verbatim) of the interchanges between these two characters, clearly at this point Midori is falling in love with Toru. I think they watch a building burn down when they meet up that Sunday, and she tells him a whole host of lies that come out later in the book, which really deepens the connection between these two.<br /><br />Now if you're the kind of reader who says, \\"Wait, this book sounds amazing, but please tell me that the depression and dark suicidal tones of the novel continue,\\" go ahead and pick this puppy up right now. You will not be disappointed. We now have two, that's righttwo, women who are total sociopaths that Watanabe is supposedly either \\"in love with\\" or \\"falling for\\". This is the perfect time to bring Naoko back into the mix, whom Toru goes to the visit in the looney bin, and a third nutzoid lady shows up, too: Reiko! After spending some time in the mountains with these two perfect catches, he comes back and is faced with the truth that his life is complicated, and he is having trouble managing it. I think that this was the point when I really started to get that Holden Caulfield  feeling. I just don't care about a kid who is 19 and can't figure out which girl to go with. Life is hard, get over it.<br /><br />For the remaining 150 pages of this literary masterpiece, the same old, tired things keep happening: everyone is depressed, multiple people commit suicide, everyone's life is a mess, no one is happy. Character development is awful, as almost all of the characters (Naoko, Midori, Nagasawa especially), except Toru a bit and Reiko at the very end, evolve absolutely NONE during the course of the year-plus that we follow them. I just don't understand the mass appeal of a novel that really has little action, little character development, a bunch of crazy/sad people killing themselves, and in the end leaves you wondering if the author himself can't get over his high school girlfriend. Grow up.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool game. kinda gets boring after. a while thou. the games are fun i want more games!!! fun to play on a road trilp
B004LWZW8I|1.0|This is even worse than the Percy Jackson movie adaptation.<br /><br />The original [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans (Keep Case Packaging)]] was the best adaptation of the Greek mythology.<br /><br />The worst is this movie.<br />The director attempts to infuse a [[ASIN:B000V39KDO 300]] to a mythological sense and fails utterly.<br />First of all in mythology, Zeus is a bearded guy and older. Poseidon is bearded guy and with a trident. And Titans are imprisoned in Tartarus as bits and pieces. (Like Percy Jackson books).<br /><br />Iam giving it one star because the special effects are good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|every time I take out my kindle fire..I am always looking forward to 101 games!!!!!its the one game where you never get tired of playing it!! it is so fun!! I would totally recommend it!!!
B004EPYZXK|2.0|Technically there's really nothing all that wrong with this film. It uses the \\"found footage\\" format (crudely shot amateur video from a single limited point of view as if someone captured it on a home movie camera), which is fine and in this case fits the overall intent of the story.<br /><br />Nothing much wrong with the acting either. In fact the performances are quite passable.<br /><br />The visuals and effects work okay as well. Nothing too spectacular was required but what there is works just fine.<br /><br />The problem isn't even with the story itself, though there's nothing really new here. An Apollo crew goes on a secret mission to the moon and encounters alien creatures.<br /><br />What sinks the entire enterprise is the overall of the project. It is unrelentingly grim, certainly not the sort of thing you want to watch for entertainment.<br /><br />You get the feeling it is something rather dark and unpleasant just by looking at the poster. A previously unknown Apollo moon mission that you've never heard about before which, logic tells you, must have been lost with all hands. That's kind of depressing to consider and it's what you realize just from the poster.<br /><br />Not that it couldn't have been a tragedy, like one of the Shakespeare plays were everyone dies in the end, like Romeo & Juliet or Hamlet. Both of those are great works, full of engaging thoughts and idea.<br /><br />But what's missing in Apollo 18 is any sense of heroism or transcendant sacrifice. Basically it's a trio of ordinary guys who got lied to by those they work for (NASA, the US government) and callously sent to their deaths in the interests of... well, we never find out why (another problem). Mostly what we get is three guys in a tight spot struggling to stay alive, even though we already know they are all going to die in the end.<br /><br />And they do exactly what real people in such circumstances would do... panic, rage, totally freak out, try anything they can think of to survive. None of them have any kind of epiphany about the need to sacrifice themselves, none of them do anything particularly noble. They're just a trio of already doomed guys wasting their time and effort trying to stay alive. That's not what I would call entertainment. You get about the same feeling you would if you stabbed an animal in the gut and then just watched it suffer and slowly bleed to death.<br /><br />I could consider it an unsuccessful attempt to do what others managed to pull off in the original Director's cut of \\"Butterfly Effect\\". For the theatrical release of that one the studio required the filmmakers to tack on a silly \\"happy ending\\" which totally negated the entire rest of the story. In the original cut, the lead character dies. But he does so willingly because he understands he must to help or save others, which elevates it to a kind of heroic, nobel self-sacrifice. True, it's also pretty grim to watch but there is a feeling of something transcendant going on (despite how unpleasant the outcome is.) In the case of Apollo 18 there's no such \\"moral\\" or \\"point\\" to things.<br /><br />If you really want to get the major feeling raised by this movie, watch the TV news for the next story about a bunch of miners trapped alive in a collapsed tunnel, where they make it plain there's no way they're going to ever be rescued. It feels a lot like that. And the miners would be a lot easier on your wallet, being TV news and thus free.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a great concept to have access to the word. Being able to read on the go while being able to change the fonts at any given moment.
B004LKRR6U|5.0|I first saw a Grace Kelly doll that was a bride doll and she took my breath away.  The price was more than I wanted to pay but when I saw this doll on line I had to have her.  I was not disappointed.  She is exquisite and for the money it is a fanatastic find.  Do not hestitate to purchase.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Perhaps it got better but after about 45 minutes of bland acting I had to turn it off. I am rather ashamed that I purchased this movie as I was on the fence to begin with. Rent the film rather than buying it
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Absolutely Superb.<br /><br />Album of the year 2012 and essential listening for lovers of quality music<br />A perfect hybrid of Soul, Jazz ,Hip-Hop and Pop. Stunning compositions and spot-on production
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|really fun well made game. plays great on droidx. I would have given it 5 stars if the bosses had a life meter so you can see how much life they have left. also would be nice to know what weapons to use on which enemies.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|This app force closes every time i try to run it. Good thing it was free because it definitely isn't worth the money to buy it when you cant even play it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have only played a few games, but the ones I have played were fun. The games kept me entertained for a while
B0008ENHTE|5.0|If you want a great movie with great action and excitement in it as well as plenty of secret agent action and so on then this is truly the movie for you \\"Bullitt\\" Starring Steve McQueen is a great movie and he plays a great character Lieutenant Frank Bullitt, who has to protect a witness who has to testify in an important trial and Bullitt has to protect him then the witness is shot and then Bullitt has to find the person who killed him as well as take down all of the other king pins and the other people responsible who are part of this group called the mob and he ends up solving the case and getting the head guy who was responsible for it all. So this indeed I can say this is a great movie to buy I highly recommend it. Also this movie was made way back in 1968 and this movie is also indeed a classic and has really neat classic look to it when you see it, Hope you enjoy this movie if you buy it Thank you, Enjoy.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder by R. J. Palacio is the kind of book that from the first page, made me tilt my head to the side and raise my eyebrows.  That is code for, \\"Huh.  I'm interested.\\"  By the end of the first chapter, I was already invested in the main character, August \\"Auggie\\" Pullman, and anticipated being mad at his enemies and cheering his victories as I read on.<br /> Auggie was born with a host of facial anomalies, making his appearance exceedingly unusual.  In his words: \\"Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\\" As a speech pathologist, I've had some exposure to children with facial anomalies.  I really applaud the way Ms. Palacio dealt with the description of Auggie's facial features.  She realistically portrays the struggles of what this kind of genetic snafu would entail, including surgeries and difficulties with basic things like eating. Throughout the story, she intermittently gives us bits and pieces of details, like stolen glances, so that by the end of the book, we have a pretty good idea of what Auggie looks like, without ever having to stare him in the face, which he would hate.<br /> We meet Auggie as he is about to enter 5th grade, his first time going to school with other children.  From there, the author creates a well fleshed-out microcosm of society.  We feel his parent's anxiety tenderly, and his sister's protectiveness fiercely.  As new kids enter his world, you will find yourself thinking, \\"which kind of kid would I, or my kids, be?\\"  You will hope you'd be like his non-judgmental friend Summer, but if you're being truthful, you'll wonder if you'd be more like Jack - friends to his face, but denying him behind his back, or Julian - downright unaccepting.<br /> The teachers in the story can be a bit preachy at times, and adult readers may feel like they are being force-fed the story's morals.  However, I happen to appreciate teachers who weave character education into their lessons, and find myself force-feeding morals to my own kids from time to time.  For the intended audience of a middle grade novel, it works.<br />  This story is a must read for kids in today's society.  We have had amazing breakthroughs in medical technology, and more and more children with differences are surviving and thriving.  We want these kids to know that while it might take us a moment to get to know them, we value them and want them in our lives.  We want our `typically developing' kids to understand that we all have differences, we all have struggles, and people should be accepted for who they are, and the gifts they have to share.  This book will help with that important work.<br />  I highly recommend this book.  I hope you will read it and enjoy, then pass it along and share the message.  Wonder, and August Pullman, will be with you for a long time.ime.  For the intended audience of a middle grade novel, it works.<br />  This story is a must read for kids in today's society.

B0067LXQAW|4.0|The Irish rock band The Cranberries are back with a new CD 'Roses'. The music (11 new tracks) in this new CD is unmistakenly the sound that made this band famous with hits like \\"Linger\\". Lead vocals by Dolores O'Riordan are as great as ever. Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks are \\"Losing My Mind\\" : I love the wonderful vocals & melody & \\"Show Me\\" : inspirational lyrics on being shown the way/direction in life. Great tracks include \\"Conduct\\", \\"Tomorrow\\", \\"Fire And Soul\\", \\"Waiting In Walthamstow\\" & title track \\"Roses\\". Okay tracks include \\"Raining In My Heart\\", \\"Schizophrenic Playboy\\" & the slow/mellow \\"Astral Projections\\".<br /><br />On overall, The Cranberries are back following Dolores O'Riordan's solo project as if they have been always been here, unmistakenbly The Cranbberies' sound, a recommended CD listening.

B006ON41FC|4.0|At first I was frustrated with this game until I kept playing.  These types of  games I really like because they give specific goals that must be reached before advancing in the game.  I just which the squirel was a little bit easier to control.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Radiant HD looks and sounds great on the Kindle Fire. fantastic retro design all around. Fun casual mode has a simple but accurate nod to past games. Humorous banter throughout makes you chuckle a bit between levels. Highly recommended.
B006IGZWB2|1.0|I had avoided both the book, and then the movie version of THE HELP as it appeared to be yet another entry to the Driving Miss Daisy genre of feel good, simplistic examinations of topics that in truth are not easy, simple and if there is a good feeling - well, it came after a great deal of suffering, death & pain.  I finally gave in tonight and watched the movie.  I hissed at the oh so evil character very well-played by Bryce Dallas Howard.  In fact, I'll take my hat off to her for  giving some depth to what could have been a cartoon.  She plays her as a sad person - which makes the harsh lines delivered to her in the denouement seem real - despite the fact that no African American maid in the 1960s would have EVER spoken such words.  In the world of The Help - the biggest threat to the African American community is the idiocy, bitchiness or callousness of the hoity-toity \\"well-bred\\" white women.  This threat is swept away in a glistening fantasy of moxie that can rid The South of such pesky, foolish ladies.  This is because The Help teaches us that the combination of minority-underdog gumption and big-hearted white people trumps the \\"backwards\\" ways of those callow racists.  Unfortunately, The Help teaches us one thing, and history teaches us another.  Mississippi still holds segregated proms.  And, back in the 1960s, showing such \\"gumption\\" could easily result in death.  The worst The South had to offer its maids was much worse than the petty insults foisted upon them by narrow-minded bosses or by having to use a (yegads!) different toilet in the house.  While it makes me feel good to think those suffering ladies were surrounded in the cozy embrace of the daffy, loving White Trash bimbo who cleaves to her maid like a long lost sister, or the noble, curly-wigged liberal who risks not being popular or married so that she might bring equality to The South or that racist mothers dying of cancer both beat cancer AND become enlightened in a single moment --- well, I can't believe it once the movie stops playing.  In fact, what tasted like a chocolate pie while I was watching the film, tastes like Minnie's \\"special\\" pie once the movie is done.  Let's be frank.  This book is fluff.  This movie is fluff.  We all like easy entertainment.  We like to curse our villains and root for our heroes and we all want a happy ending.  However, I think it's problematic when the ingredients for this confection are portions of history that are anything but sweet.  You can't write a feel-good tale of female-bonding between do-good white women and their African American maids.  You can't have your cake and eat it it too.  The book is a lie.  The movie is a lie.  The solace I have, as I reflect on The Help, is that there WERE brave, noble, white people who wanted to bring equality to The South:  Andrew Goodman & Michael Schwerner.  They didn't end up at big job in NYC.  They ended up dead.'t believe it once the movie stops playing.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Haven't had any problems with this app like others said. Works great for me. I'm even surprised that it has info for the remote small town area I live in. :) No complaints...use it daily.
B007E6YYLO|5.0|I think this episode was pretty amazing. Andrea told Lori off, Lori knows she right and she won't admit it. I think Lori should have died in the car accident, she's not really doing much. She just is the 'Queen Bee' like Andrea said. Bringing a baby into that world is not a great situation. Shane shouldn't have lived, Rick is being too nice to everyone. He slept with his wife, tried to make the rules, and he tried to be the father of Carl. Why would you still want to be friends with him? He's done too much already. Breaking the lock on the barn was intense, finding Sophia was the only good that came out of it. I also think they should keep Shaun alive, the only thing he did wrong was sticking up for the last group he was in. Rick saved him, it would be a waste of time just to kill him now. My final thought on this is there is too much drama, there needs to be more action; I think they should go back in the city and try to find other groups like in the first season, try to find another CDC.
0061969656|5.0|All six books on this series are great. Mr. Cornwell really knows his job and makes historical fiction something \\"real\\" and the characters just get better. You learn a lot about the dark ages and laugh loud late in the night when reading his books (although my wife does not enjoy that), such a great humour sense. Really looking forward for the next on the series!
1439102732|5.0|As always with Jodi Picoult, she has taken made a story with every twist and turn a reader could dream of, with absolutely gut wrenching story lines.  I absolutely love reading her books because she follows through on the topics that normally would be unspoken and unknown.  My Sister's Keeper was the first book that I read by Jodi Picoult and I must say that it has made an everlasting impact on me.  That is one book that I will never forget.  I enjoyed every single bit of this story and was amazed with the twists and turns of every chapter!  I would not hesitate to recommend this story to everyone.  It definitely did not end up the way I envisioned it would, however had the best ending!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|My brother introduced me to the epic music genre. I didn't have any of that kind of music and while I liked it didn't buy any at the time. That changed when I heard Heart of Courage on a trailer for a game... I immediately bought their album... I have never regretted that decision and can honestly say I've listened to the album more than another other I've bought.<br /><br />Anywho, don't really know what else to say, you'll either like it or not and I doubt I can convince anyone either way. So listen to the sample and know it is good.. :)
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Great app! Got it for free and am glad I did not pass it up! Scans receipts perfectly, which I then send to my docs app.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|this cover works very well ...protects well and the easel feature is something I use very often...I feel that it will protect my kindle very well
0345410025|5.0|Turns out that when an atom of Cesium is bombarded with energy is starts vibrating / ticking and every such 9129631770 ticks counts as a second. Hence the name atomic clock. Now in order to remember that number I just go: button push meets cow cozy (actually thinking of a button with push written on it talking to a happy cow). Absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />This was my first memory improvement book and I loved the techniques mentioned in here. Although extremely impressed, I know I have to keep working on these techniques for a long time to get comfortable with them. Will start recommending this book to a few people who might find it interesting.<br /><br />\\"It is impossible to think without a mental picture.\\" - Aristotle

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I like the Marware folio covers. This one is on  my Kindle Fire and I like is as much as the iPad2 cover.<br />It is protective without a lot of bulk, not obtrusive when folded back, and easy to hold.<br /><br />Marware gets my vote of confidence for well designed functional products at very reasonable cost for the quality of the product.

1400069289|5.0|It's not often I pick up a book like this (part self-help/part gripping journalism/part business) and read all the way through. So many non-fiction book these days read more like overly long magazine articles that someone decided to force into a book. This one's different. Duhigg is a gifted storyteller, unraveling tales of people and businesses who have radically changed courses through the simplest of tactics: habits. Love the Paul O'Neill chapter and the tale of Target. I've also started experimenting on myself, working on switching from my morning croissant habit to a hard-boiled egg habit. Fingers crossed.
B007E6YYLO|2.0|Like the title reads, I wish that either Shane or Rick would just die already. I don't care who now since Rick chose to come back and rescue a man who is so apparent in his hate for him. So one of them needs to die already so the writers can stop using their tension as a crutch. On secoond thought, I want it to be Rick just for the simple fact that I don't buy his wide-eyed innocent view of the world any longer. Jesus Christ, it's one thing to try to save everyone and their cat but when it comes between you and a man who wants you dead so that he can replace you then what is the issue here? Where is the angst in making this decision? I don't care if it's your best friend from the 3rd grade. There are lines in life you don't let anyone cross post-apocolypse or not. Also, I don't think that the resolution of this conflict between Shane and Rick and Carol and Andrea is the big ticket item for this season. Don't get me wrong I think that this is going to happen, but I think the big surprise is going to be when Rick reveals what the doctor told him at the end of season 1. It probably has something to do with the two cop corpses they found that weren't bitten. So why don't they get on with it already and quit playing around. I don't think I'll hold out much longer for this show. It's times like these I wish The Wire was still on.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Good controls and fun homage to early 80s games. Elements of Asteroids and Galaga. Works well on an ICS tablet like the Asus.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Around 2010-2011, &quot;Angry Birds&quot; became an extremely popular game. Because of all the commotion about it, I realized I had to see what the fuss was about. So I bought the newest version of the game, &quot;Angry Birds Rio (Ad-Free)&quot; for $0.99. As I started playing it, I realized that it was pretty fun and addicting. The more frustrated I got about losing a level, the more I wanted to continue playing! For this price, the game is a steal.
B0053B347M|4.0|This product is exactly what you expect! the only issue I had is that the adhesive isn't strong enough (on its own) to hold the wired end in place.  After a an hour or so it started peeling at that edge, and the next day it came off completely!  Easily remedied with a small strip of duct tape over the end of the wire.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I'm a vocalist and wanted something I could use at home. The H4n works perfect for me during practice, and using canned music at home I was able to set it up so it made decent recordings while I sang through the PA mic. I've fooled around with PA equipment for years, but I know very little about recording other than singing. The instructions were easy and I can use this system with no problems. I just plug in the headphones and record and play it back. It's been great.
0756404738|5.0|Wow, another incredible book from Mr. Rothfuss.  Very inventive and unpredictable plot line.  Great writing.  An extremely likable but flawed main character.  Interesting mysteries galore.  And some really good, offbeat humor thrown in as well (love some of the dialogue from Tempe and Vashette).  I do understand the reviews that voice a touch of frustration that we have not gained much insight regarding the big mysteries.  I had assumed this book would take us all the way up to present time and fully explain how Kvothe ended up in his diminished capacity tending bar and baking pies.  Then book three could move forward in time, with the narration taking place all in present tense.  However, as far as I can tell, we are not even close to that point (present time) at the end of book two.  Still, for me, that does not in any way diminish the greatness of this book.  Even at 1000 pages, it was a page-turner all the way.  I never found it to be too detailed or boring.  Not even close.  I must say that I don't believe it will be possible to take us all the way to the present and into the future, to a satisfactory conclusion that ties up all the loose ends, in one final book (unless things are rushed, which would really be a shame).  I think it's got to be at least two more books (two long books, in fact), which is fine with me.  Actually, from my perspective, three more books would be great.  I'll be very sad when the tale is over.  Let me also add that I listened to part of this book in my car on CD, and the narration and voices used in that production are absolutely fantastic as well.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|rocks. I.wish I could carry this where ever I go.  really handy. u can go as far as u.want with it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game, only downside is having to unlock other games. overall a good game though and very easy to play.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app is fantastic. It works great even on a 3g connection. I'd give it 5 stars if I could move files from the remote pc directly to the tablet, but with full access to email etc. it works just fine moving files. Also, I was able to run some pretty powerful software for film editing right from the tablet no problem, and operate the PC's webcam remotely, which is a great security feature.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|something fun with different games. it keeps me occupied when I'm bored. :)  cant wait to finish the whole games.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|When Lena escaped into the wilds, she ended up alone and devastated by the loss of her newfound love, Alex. She is taken in by a rebel group at a homestead in an abandoned town, and struggles to recover emotionally and physically as best as she can. Life is hard as a rebel, and it only gets harder as Lena is drawn into a more active role in the resistance, getting close to Julian, son of an anti-love activist. When the two are abducted and must figure out how to escape unscathed, working together uncovers secrets...and feelings that Lena didn't think she'd ever feel again.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's second book in the Delirium trilogy is just as emotional, intense, and action-packed as the first. Oliver picks up right where Delirium leaves off, with Lena at an all-time low. To have a strong heroine who has overcome so much be dealt such a blow is hard to read about, but readers will find Pandemonium nearly impossible to put down. Oliver keeps the book from being gloomy by hopping back and forth between Lena's recovery and her undercover role months later back in society, racketing up the suspense and tension with each chapter. Oliver's plotting is extremely clever, from escape routes to secret codes and hidden intentions, and she always manages to work in a plot twist when you least expect it. Lena's relationship with Julian is different from the one she had with Alex--it's much more tentative and complicated, yet no less vivid and heartfelt. Those stolen romantic moments are almost as sweet as the tantalizing glimpses of other long lost characters. Pandemonium certainly lives up to its title with its constant action and relationships in a state of flux, but small triumphs and moments of happiness do exist amongst the chaos. Oliver conclude the novel with a cliffhanger ending that will irrevocably change the life that Lena has managed to build for herself, and readers will be desperate for the next book in this beautifully written and emotionally wrought series.<br/><br />Cover Comments: I like how this cover is in the same style as the new Delirium cover, and I do think it;s really pretty, though it doesn't exactly fit the story.
193418070X|1.0|I loved this story for all the reasons that other readers did. Don't let my one-star deter you from the book.  It's quite compelling.<br /><br />I am only adding a review for the audio production because it was just terrible.  It reminded me of the automated slide shows that students were subjected to in schools during the 80s.  Terrible musical interludes and the readers were clearly asked to make it changes to the way of speaking that was just too contrived.  I wish that I had read it in visual format.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars by John Green tells the story of a young teen girl who has Cancer.  At her weekly Cancer support group session that she is reluctant to go to, she meets a young teen boy who takes a special interest in her.  I don't think I'm giving up too much if I tell you that a romance develops.<br /><br />This book lives up to all the hype in my opinion.  I flat out LOVED IT!  It is a beautiful love story that I was into from page one to the end.  If this story doesn't tear at your heart strings, then I don't know what will.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried.  Please give this book a chance!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok but I got like 2 more games to unlocked<br />its more fun since I got more games and play them over and over again
B002BWP49C|2.0|I was not impressed with this installment, and the ending was just blah!! they could have made this more exciting. I bought the movie and I'm going to return it and buy it used. the wedding scene was nice, but the movie went downhill after that, I was really looking forward to the scene with the Volturi and it was not in the movie!!. I hope the next saga is much better than this crap they churned out.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|To me this is the greatest album ever. Every single song hits the spot. I can play this over and over again and not get tired of it. Its the only album for me that i can do this with.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun mini games most of the time. cons: poor controls and no way of knowing what a game is before you pay to unlock it
B00138GZAC|5.0|I got this for $8 @ best buy I love her work and her songs always keep my mood tranquil, I am a super fan of Sade....
B005LAIGRS|4.0|This movie had just enough of everything. The plot was good, they didn't come out and tell you what was going to happen right away. The car chases were just enough and very exciting. The emotional factor (yes there was one in this action movie) was good, mainly between Ryan Reynolds character and his girlfriend. There was no cussing, no nudity but a lot of viloence although I thought the violence was more of a suggested than actual visual like some movies.  Overall this is a movie that makes you think, keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't throw curse words at you left and right. Denzel plays his character to a Tee, very good Mr. Washington and Ryan Renolds does this serious roal very well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'm so mad @ Gale or the fact that the author didn't give any \\"future\\" updates on his life. I'm glad she ended up with Peeta but I always thought she would end up with Gale for some strange reason lol and I thnk the way the book ended there is room for a 4th book involving their kids.... I can't wait to see the movie March 23.....
B0063IH60K|4.0|it was ok ok ok ok okok ok ok okay it had some glitches. but other than that it was ok.  pancakes. fish love peace
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I read Lester Tenny's book. My hitch in hell then noticed that your grandfather and Lester lived similar lives during the same war. Lester was captured in the phillipines and your grandfather in Germany. But the best thing is that they both decided for themselves  to live to tell their story. They never gave up. Thank you. I now empathize fully with the holocaust survivors in my shul when I was growing up.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy playing many games of spider solitaire on this app. its just like you are playing the game on your computer
B001N1DPDE|5.0|All the older reviews I saw said that the sheath was weak and had very little blade retention. I received my BK2 on 2/27/12 and the sheath had so much retention it was hard to remove and I'm a pretty strong guy. This caused a whole new issue however because now, when I sheathe or unsheathe the knife the rigid plastic must split about 1cm at its seams in order for the knife to pass in and out.<br /><br />The manufacturer needs to redesign the sheath, it sucks. The knife is awesome; super beefy and obviously a dependable workhorse. It is worth the price even with the sheath issues. The cloth belt loop is totally useless but its removable with 3 phillips screws, the rigid plastic 'could' make a good sheath if its properly modified.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to buy this knife, but plan some mods on the sheath or make your own. There are instructional videos on YouTube to do this. It's a much better idea than dropping almost $300.00 on a Hedgehog...
B00632HWOG|1.0|The app worked at first and then just wouldent let me check my email till I got the update. When I tried to download the update it took a really long time and still wouldent download. I tried taking the app off my kindel fire and then reinstall it but it has been trying to install for two days now. Great app when it works but once it goes haywire it is horrible
B004AFFZNI|4.0|90% of the time, my GoPro Hero 2 rests it's feet inside this case. I mainly bought this case to allow access to the USB Charging slot while it's mounted to my windshield and connected to my cigarette socket for full time powering. One of the greatest features of this case is the ability to record clearer audio with the built in microphone. No longer will you hear that awful plastic chunky-chingy-thunking sound that the underwater cases are prone to causing. The case is solid, is opened on both left and right sides and has all button functions that the OEM case has. Definitely recommend this to any looking to access GoPro's USB, Audio, Video and SD slots without having to remove it from it's casing every time. Just remember that this case isn't full protective so don't use it in any areas that would ruin your camera: Water, Mud, dirt, etc.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Works PERFECT with my Kindle Fire. I have a busy and hectic life and this calendar app is the solution to keeping my appointments! Its highly customizeable and easy to sync with my Android phone and online Google account. BEST Google calendar app on the market! Five stars all the way. Definitely worth the $5.99. Smiley face.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|great games, addicting gameplay, only bad thing is you gotta wait to get to all the good games, pretty good in general though.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|This is by far the best drama-series I've ever encountered, not to mention it keeps getting better....1,2,3,4 come on now Im ready for season 5...
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game is addicting and i love it. right now it's on sale in the regular Android market for .99
1427646341|5.0|I haven't heard too many audio books, but I really liked this one.  The characterization was engaging and believable. I listened to it in my car going to work every morning, so it took awhile, but it was fun.  I'll have to check to see if this reader has any more books!
B005GVF95O|5.0|My 2 year old loves this app. He can go through the puzzles pretty quickly, but it has kept his attention when most other apps haven't. It has also helped teach him both animals and body parts. I would recommend to anyone with a toddler.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I don't usually play games, but my son suggested this one and I am really enjoying it. I'm a Senior and it fits my needs.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I hated apple and loved android then I got an iPad and picked out this book to be the first kindle book to read on it and I could not put the book down I ow understand how and why apple was and hopefully  will continue to provide the products jobs make into reality this book moved me awesome well written and mindblowing
0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games revolves around a post-apocalyptic society where 12 Districts are pitted against each other by 'the Capital'. The Capital keeps the 12 Districts from bonding in order to rebel by annually sponsoring the 'Hunger Games', in which 1 boy and 1 girl, ages 12-18, are chosen in a lottery each year to compete to the death. The survivor is crowned champion and it benefits the entire district. The heroine of this book is Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers to take her little sister's place  in the Hunger Games for District 12.<br /><br />I was skeptical, but I couldn't stop reading once I started. It's entertaining, and incredibly disturbing all at once.
0439023491|5.0|Loved this book! It was heart warming and sad and just increadibly good. Can't wait for the movies to come out. It's an awesome book!
0061992860|5.0|My copies all were great. Good binding and all. I and even the kids all love there copy. Writing is small but the book is loaded with info. Not really a beginner but well worth the money. Look on the smartphone app. store and you can even get this on your phone. Then hope your phone doesn't die.... That is why you can't go wrong with a real book. ;)
B0063IH60K|5.0|great clean Klondike game. being able to move cards to left of screen was appreciated too.  play this one whenever a quick break is needed
0439023513|1.0|I was a huge fan of the first two books. This book however is by far one of the most disappointing i have ever read. It was so rushed to the point that it lost the feel that made the first two great.<br /><br />SPOILER_________________SPOILER______________SPOILER_______________<br /><br />My biggest problem is not so much with the ending but just the stuff that was basically ignored.<br />-First is Finnick'd death. They make him a special weapon to use and we never see him use it. He is supposed to be this great fighter but yet he goes out without a fight. In one paragraph he is killed off. It's not so much that he died but HOW he died. What book kills a great character just like that?<br />-Second is the deal with the pearl. I wanted to see Peeta snap out of it. I thought the author kept hinting at that pearl to be important, but it had absolutely no meaning. I thought it should have been the the thing that brought him back. She ends up with Peeta but I mean it it basically nothing. I would have rather both of them died than end up going through life like zombies. She summed up the rest of their like in 3 pages. WE READ AND SUPPORTED THE WHOLE SERIES AND ALL SHE GIVES US IS 3 PAGES!!!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I loved the first book. I liked the second book.  This third book was not worth reading at all.  In fact, the story would have best been served by ending the first book with the handful of poisonous berries.  The kids should have eaten them, end of story.<br /><br />But the story didn't end that way and the second book happened, and then I suppose the third book had to happen to wrap up the loose ends.  Except it was poorly written, the storyline was stilted and contrived and predictable, and the epilogue was pat and disappointing.  The characters in the first book were so complicated and real, and they became two-dimensional and cartoonish in this third book.<br /><br />Honestly, don't spend your money.  Just go back and re-read the first book, or make up your own ending to this story.  Whatever you come up with cannot possibly be worse than this book.
0545425115|5.0|I ordered The Hunger Games and read it in one day because I couldn't put it down. I ordered the two other books in the trilogy and read both of those in two days.  They are well written and you really get to like the characters so you keep reading to see how it all ends..I wish it could have kept going.  It would make a good TV series.  This was the first time I've read Suzanne Collins work and I really enjoyed them.  I look forward to her future books...
B003Y5H574|3.0|I'm gald I didn't pay more than I did for this movie. It was funny but did \\"Drag along\\" for a while. I would consider it as a \\"B\\" movie.<br />As for the person I ordered it from I would buy from them again. It came on time and was a new unopened DVD.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love the PC version and now for my android! Came across no problems, smooth UI and graphics can't wait for more updates.
B005Z9MH98|4.0|The story and the human acting is modest but the Chimps trump the lot, they are fantastic. How the trainers got so much out of them is a wonder and the disc is worth it just for the Chimps. Picture quality is better than the DVD and the subtitles are excellent. The story has a sad side however and is not really suitable for young children despite the happy ending.
B004ZNAXX2|1.0|I find it amazing that they refer to this collection as the Immersion edition of The Wall. They charge over $100 for this set and it doesn't even include the movie (just a snippet of it)! Also, the previous 2 Immersion sets (Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here) included high resolution and surround sound versions of the album. I had every intention of buying this until I found out none of that stuff would be included in this set. I know it isn't the same sound quality, but I can buy a version on iTunes (sorry Amazon it doesn't look like you have this available)that has almost everything from this box set for only $30 (including the documentary and pictures of the memorabilia in this set)! There is very little incentive to spend $120 on this incomplete \\"Immersion\\" set. I give the music on this 3 1/2 stars and the product itself 1 star.
B00003CXCQ|1.0|This video must have been copied as the video display keeps popping up.  The beginning is garbled and the ending stops short.  I was sorely disappointed and will NEVER buy a video from here again.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I don't know why I like this movie.I've watched it four times trying to figure it out. It isn't fast paced. It isn't complex. It isn't flashy. It could be that Tommy Lee Jones plays his part to perfection. It could be that John Goodman is better than ever. It could be that a simple story told well is better than flash and complexity. It's a film that tugs at your heart, pisses you off, makes you laugh, and offers just enough of the surreal to intrigue you. Heck if I know why I like it I just do.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|I bought the second cd but couldn't find this one. I am now enjoying this cd just as much if not better than there 2nd cd. I would recommend this cd to all country and easy listening  style of music fans.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app to download. The only thing only thing I would like if you could still read when you weren't on wifi. More like a book.
0887431453|5.0|MY daughter is turning 4 in a matter of days, and I got this book to start prepping her for a school environment. She loves it, and I love it. The activities are colorful and fun for her to do and she is learning while doing them. I will definitely be getting this book again when my 2nd daughter is old enough for it.
B001FB563E|4.0|As a frequent commenter on several discussions about the book \\"The Road\\" I have stayed away from the film discussion but I feel it's time to lay it to rest.  Having waded through all of the posted reviews in this discussion it seems to me that the same fact should be stated for the film version as applies to the book. That being that this is a film that has no middle ground in terms of approval or disapproval.  It isn't for idle entertainment. It requires active thinking on the part of the viewer.  Some of the reviews posted here simply don't get it and do a disservice but there are many that for well stated reasons hated this film primarily because it moves slowly, it is a \\"dark\\" film, the characters don't act like heroes, the imagery is depressing, the reason for the apocalypse is vague at best, and many other reasons  but I think I've hit the main ones.  So if you want a film that moves along at a fast pace, has a clear and easy to follow plot, has plenty of action, has heroic, sexy, or funny characters, is mostly bright and colorful and has a resolution where all ends well, \\"The Road\\" isn't your film.<br /><br />There are several very good reviews before this one that go into details I won't repeat again except that it's my opinion that the book's author, Cormac McCarthy, gave the film his approval for reasons other than the film being true to the book.  I was surprised when I saw the film because the film changes several key scenes, alters the time line, and omits several of the most important scenes in the book. I don't want to spoil these changes by writing about them, but if you did enjoy the film you should read the book if you haven't already done so.  It's a relatively short book, with no chapters.  So have a bookmark on hand.  It's written in a style that some have called \\"stream of consciousness\\" which isn't exactly accurate.  It is written primarily in the third person but there are moments when this shifts into first person from The Man's point of view.  There are several sublimely wonderful passages that appear throughout the book including a coda at the end that may not seem related to the story at first, and has created a storm of opinions since the book's publication.  The book, like the film, may seem to move slowly, particularly the first third of the book, but it sets the scene and drives home the desperation and loneliness of the world in ruin.  I can see why McCarthy approved the film as a passable attempt to convey his transcendent Southern gothic horror into a big screen entertainment product. Clearly it's wasn't going to be as popular as \\"No Country for Old Men\\" but even that film was controversial due mainly to the ending.<br /><br />As I read \\"The Road\\" it seemed to be written in a cinematic style, as if he wrote it for a film, even though I don't think that his intention. But several of his previous novels were successfully transformed into films and perhaps when he wrote \\"The Road\\" it was in his mind.  So for a quick film review: the acting is excellent, the cinematography is realistic for the most part, although there are some scenes that I noticed trees with leaves in the background, the music score is excellent, the continuity is fair to good (although there are huge leaps in the time line), and the direction seems very good.  I have to give it less than five stars because I know too much about the story and the film tends to try to condense parts of the ending and leaves out several important scenes.  There are a few scenes in the film that aren't in the book, but that's to be expected with most book to film adaptations.  These are additions and subtractions made by the production team that may have as much to do with their budget, schedules,  and locations as with any artistic purpose or even the conceits of the stars or directors. As I've previously stated, I was disappointed that they left out several key scenes, at least two may have been considered too shocking and some alterations in the plot were unfortunate.  The blu-ray does show several out takes that were left out of the film but only one is a scene in the book that was cut and the other is an extension of the ending which the director unfortunately cut, perhaps due to time constraints. Overall it's a good adaptation but not excellent.  Please, if you enjoyed the film at all and can do so, read the book. Your library is open.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There isn't a single dull moment in the entire book! Suzanne Collins has created an extraordinary piece with a bright imagination.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this game.  Fun twist on the classic game.  Gives hours of entertainment.  I like that tiles are easy to tell apart.
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|i would rather have spent my night on the toilet trying to excrete stones ... an hour of my life i will never get back ... in fact it was so bad that i felt it was necessary to waste some more time and try to warn someone out of ruining their evening as well
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am happy to not have paid for this app, but it is a great looking game.  Glad I got it for free.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|What a waste of a good concept! I had high hopes for this movie, especially given its cast, but I'm afraid to say it left me disappointed.<br /><br />[Some minor spoilers.]<br /><br />The opening scene - with its unexpected burst of violence and intriguing wrist-wear for Daniel Craig - promised a lot but after that it quickly becomes a by-the-numbers action movie: episodic, clichéd and derivative. It's obvious that the barman who can't shoot, for example, is going to save the day with some crack gun-play later on in the movie. Another major criticism is that I found it totally unexciting. I just sat there yawning and checking the clock.<br /><br />Which is a shame because not only does it have a great cast but there are also some flashes of intrigue and originality - such as the upside down steamer five hundred miles away from the nearest big river. More could have been done with the clash of subject matter too, the most obvious angle being the comparison of frontier life in the West with aliens pushing their own frontiers of exploration.<br /><br />Not one I can recommend.

0345479092|1.0|As others have written, this book has some pretty terrible advice for breastfeeding moms.  For instance, Tracy says when a baby refuses a bottle at the babysitter's/daycare while mom's at work, that mom is supposed to put breastfeeding on hold until the baby accepts the bottle - even if it takes 2 or 3 days.  Call me crazy, but when I returned to work full-time, I would never have imagined denying my baby who had been away from me all day, the chance to breastfeed.  Babies (and moms!) go through enough when transitioning to child care, why would you want to hurt the special breastfeeding relationship?<br /><br />Tracy does have some good points, however, much of her book does need to be read with a grain of salt, especially if you are breastfeeding.  As a new mom, I was very eager to make Tracy's routine work for my baby, as several friends highly recommended this book to me. I was so stressed out for several weeks trying make the 'EASY' routine work for us, when in fact, it just wasn't for my baby.  Others have found this book very helpful, but it totally depends on your lifestyle and baby.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a looong time!  Thought-provoking, fast-paced, engrossing!  Highly recommended.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|Plagued by apocalyptic visions and a fear he's inherited his mother's schizophrenia, Curtis (Michael Shannon) battles not only his conscious, but also the loved ones and professionals who question his behavior.  Like building a storm bunker in his backyard.  Aside from a convincing performance by Shannon - I've always enjoyed his work - the rest of the cast is average.  The film itself could very well be an M. Night vehicle.  By that I mean it's decent, not great; the script is a bit prohibitive but the story-telling is enjoyable, and there's one easy to predict plot twist that ultimately redeems what at times is a movie that drags along a little too slowly.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not this film is appreciated because of its pacing, Shannon's performance makes it required viewing for anyone who appreciates a good actor absolutely nailing a role.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun simple games, easy to pick up and start playing right away, there sure are a lot of ads but I guess you can expect that from free games
B005OK721G|4.0|Remember La Femme Nikita?  Or, better yet, Lucy Liu's history in Kill Bill?  Same thing.  It's nice revenge fantasy, and Zoe Saldana is certainly gorgeous to look at, but there is nothing very new here.  Which isn't a bad thing!  A few interesting, somewhat creative assassinations, even though I've seen better.  The blood and gore is a little lacking, not to mention the absence of nudity, limits the impact a bit.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed its simplicity.<br /><br />For a mindless action flick that does a good job from beginning to end a viewer could do much worse.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm really enjoying the options provided with all the mini games and earning points to unlock other games really appeals to my competitive side. The only negative is the constant pop up ads but those are easy enough to skip. I'd call it appealing for all ages!

B005G0ETV0|5.0|My father introduced me to Chopin and Rubinstein in the mid-70's when I was a pretty young kid, and that was the extent of any Polish heritage my family celebrated.  I learned to love the music on one particular long since lost album, and it was while searching for that music recently that I stumbled across this stunning mega-set.<br /><br />I'm somewhat familiar with the great classical composers by name and their music that is commonly heard in Fantasia, Looney Tunes, and commercial use, but have rarely tried to get smarter and listen more closely to the less well known but no less beautiful music by the same composers.  This set provides both a near-complete collection of Rubinstein recordings and a thorough library of 19th century piano-based classical compositions by all the greats, as well as some lesser-known composers and a handful of both 18th C. pieces and some 20th C. works, all at about $2 per disc.  I would never have imagined finding any comparable set of quality performances of this many works at such a low price.  In fact I've held off on exploring classical music more deeply because I never knew where to begin and have felt a bit overwhelmed.  At this price I think this set makes a fantastic introduction to the breadth and depth of piano compositions as well as a fine way to celebrate Arthur Rubinstein's contribution to performances and recordings of these works.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews of this set that complain about the short length, by modern reckoning, of most of these CDs, with a typical length of around 40 minutes.  For myself, I appreciate the shorter length as I think it's ideal for being introduced to this music, as most of it is unfamiliar to me, and I get to focus on a small set of pieces at a time.  At this price, though, I don't think the number of CDs used should be a problem.  I do appreciate the card-sleeve reproductions of the original albums, though the fine-print liner notes reveal how old I must be getting as my eyes adjust to read them.  The book included has a lovely set of photos of Rubinstein and some useful essays along with details about each disc and a great index of the recordings by composer, which helps further the set as an educational tool.<br /><br />I hope that by playing these CDs for my kids, I can pass on to them an appreciation for this music--and perhaps a little of their Polish heritage, too.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games keep me entertained! love them!((: whenever I'm bored or in school doing nothing, I always turn to this game and I play for hours.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I was really hoping to love this book but I think it was a bit hard to follow at times.  I was able to connect with all of the characters but sometimes the author would go back and forth between time and characters, which to me was confusing.  I read this book because I had read Water for Elephants and loved it.  It goes to show you not all circus books are the same.  I liked it but think that if the storyline was easier to follow, I would have loved it.
0385535139|5.0|I read this book in a couple of days:  vintage Grisham.  Just enjoyable, not too deep, and a pleasant read.<br /><br />The characters are a bunch of \\"characters\\" which adds some spice to the story.  If you just want to escape for a bit, pick it up and enjoy!
B001NFNFNU|5.0|& watching this movie in a theater setting, i was uncomfortable. i found it upsetting, a bit raw. but viewing the picture again on DVD (& on oscar night, no less) i realized that finally we had a director among moviemakers for our generation--those of us \\"television fed\\"--who has done just that. given us direction. thank you, Clint Eastwood, Mr. Mayor. Sincerely.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I love this game.  It is just challenging enough and reminds mean of the old games of my youth...but. now I am stuck trying to kill the mothership at the end of level one...anyone got any tips on how I kill that thing?
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Easily, this was one of the most well-acted and well-crafted films of 2011. Eastwood is ahead of his time as a director. Or maybe he stayed with the time, of past, when there were high standards when it came to filmmaking. Many people are now so used to underpar films that they can't even recognize what quality is anymore... Zero (major) Oscar nominations for J.Edgar. Wow. Okay. I guess Clint's more ambitious works such as this one, Changeling and Hereafter will have to wait to get there due in the future, when more people will look back and say hey that was actually good. (Seriously, The Artist was preferred by the Academy over this film? Not even a nomination for Leonardo who turned in his best performance yet? Oh brother.)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Just love it. Just what I need. it is on my phone my tablet and my I Pod Touch.<br /><br />Just want you need and it gives you all.these Free interpretation for download and to read while off line cause you cant be online all the time.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great. app buy and have fun for hours. Don't wait you're already late. Love knocking the zombies block off. Love it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is s great app that gives you all the versions of the Bible at hour fingertips ad long as you have wi-fi but you can download your favorite versions and get it any time. thud app is also very easy to use
0321525949|5.0|If you're writing unix programs, this is the book you need.  It is the only book that provides a complete, coherent guide to the unix API offered by linux and other operating systems. It has really good coverage of important details that you might not normally need to care about... until you do.  There are plenty of examples and the book provides great context to the often terse built in manual pages.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The app is easy to use with a variety of options to choose from to customize your game. Load times are fast and you only see adds after every game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|just as I said...nothing special about this game pack so far, but it can keep one entertained for plenty of time just trying new games.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|I've always had an admiration of artists who attempt to cross the boundaries of their genre and venture out of their comfort zone to indulge in something new and exciting, not only for them but for their audience as well. This admiration is punctuated by the fact that not everyone who does this is successful at it. In fact, in my experience I've seen more failures and mediocre offerings then I have anything else (see The Hip Hop Violinist [Explicit]). That being said, Robert Glasper's Black Radio has definitely taken its place among the ranks of high quality music.<br /><br />Being new to Robert Glasper, I admit that I was drawn in by the promise of the plethora of guest appearances by familiar faces, such as Musiq Soul Child, Lela Hathaway, Lupe Fiasco, Yassin Bey (aka Mos Def), Erykah Badu, Ledisi, and Bilal. Fortunately, I found that Glasper's ability to tastefully spread out the various talents found on this project is worthy of praise. With twelve different guest artists on an album, it can easily start to feel crowded like there's too much going on at once. Instead, what we're given as the final product is a euphoric blend of Jazz, Neo-Soul and Hip Hop that I can cool out to in the car with my speakers up, or vibe to at a live performance.<br /><br />Each song seemed to be tailored (and most likely was) to the individual artists that appeared on them, but still making it very clear in its sound that this was Robert Glasper's album, not a compilation of sounds taken from different places. The integrity of Glasper's work is never compromised of overshadowed by any of the guest artists, only accentuated by energy their voices bring to each track. From beginning to end, it feels like listening to a live set that you don't want to leave your seat for.<br /><br />Being primarily a Hip Hop head, I was particularly interested in how Lupe and Mos Def would be incorporated into the music, since both have stepped into the realms beyond their genre's as well. Thankfully, their presence was utilized well, making their performances sound genuinely organic. I found Mos's track \\"Black Radio\\" especially interesting, as he seemed very much at home from what I've heard from him in past works (see New Danger which is full of examples). Staying true to the idea of this being an \\"experiment,\\" both Mos and the intstrumentation fly off in the the stratosphere playing off each other with varying tempos and vocal play from Mos himself that I find hard to describe in any other way but \\"interesting.\\" By no means is it a bad thing, just worthy of note, and clearly he makes the track his own.<br /><br />Overall, Black Radio is a solid body of work, fluid in its composition yet bold enough to make you stay and listen. Robert Glasper, despite being labeled simply as a Jazz musician, has successfully achieved crossing genre's and bringing different elements back to his own realm, giving us new and unique music to enjoy that will not disapoint. Having been thoroughly impressed by his latest work, I'll definitely be checking out his earlier stuff as well, and I'd encourage anyone else to do the same. Enjoy.their presence was utilized well, making their performances sound genuinely organic.

1451627289|4.0|If you could go back in time and change history to make the world a better place would you. Stephen King tackles that theme in 11/22/63, taking us on Jake Epping's journey as he travels back in time as George Amberson from 2011 to stop the Kennedy assassination in 1963. We already know that King is one of the best modern horror writers, with this book he becomes one of the best modern fiction writers as well.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of time travel fiction. It's easy for an author to make mistakes. Time travel can be tricky and often ends up being messy prose. King improves this type of storytelling by adding themes, choices, and consequences to his story. He does use the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" trope creating ripples throughout time and improves on this by making time fight back, the past in 11/22/63 does not want to be changed. King's prose is easy to read contributing to a great story.<br /><br />Kings characters mesh making them believable. Their interconnections work great, especially when King contrasts Jake's failed marriage with Christy in 2011 with his love for Sadie in the 1960s. The friendships King writes for Jake with Al, Deke, and Ellie, also juxtapose themselves with reality creating a greater story and bringing depth.<br /><br />One problem I do have with this book is the set up. King spends so much time describing the events from 1958 to 1963 that when he finally shows us what happened in the future it feels passé. I would have loved to have gone deeper into the changes after the assassination was stopped, delving further into the history of how the world changed rather than have just a couple of pages. Sure, we get hints and glimpses of what has happened since 63, and Jake mulls over the choices that he has made. For me as a reader, it just was not enough.<br /><br />One of the unique passages within the book comes from the town of Derry where King brings us back to one of his older stories, \\"It\\". Not once but twice does King go back to the Maine townas he describes the Pennywise murders, Jake encounters Richie as well as Bev all the while he is trying to save a family that haunts him in his future. Using Derry grounds the story for Stephen King fans and allows them to know the world that he creates. It also allows King to build on the themes from Derry, such as Jake's feeling that something is not right in the town, and transpose them onto the city of Dallas as well. Derry provides a mystique to the book, allowing King to flow the mystery of time fighting back throughout the novel.<br /><br />This book is Stephen King at his best, but it is still not his best book. For me that has to go to It. I still walk around looking down sewer grates scared that I will see Pennywise staring up at me ever since I read that novel in my teens. With 11/22/63, King proves that he is not just a genre writer, this is one of the best pieces of time historical fiction that I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to any historical fiction or Stephen King fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ahhh....why can't they write stories like this for adults?  I actually had trouble believing this was \\"youth fiction.\\" Get it. Get the whole trilogy. Set aside a day and consume them all in one sitting.  Yum!!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|The Blue ray was new as promised.  The show is great.  Good twists.  Interesting.  I have heard many people postulating their interpretation of what actually happened.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Many therapist complain about what he ( Paul ) doesn't do right but they fail to see the bigger picture. But isnt that what therapist do anyways take a large picture and break it down into sections so that they can get to the \\" Root \\" of an issue?<br />  You are getting a view that many don't.. A complete unbroken down issue.  Not all therapist are the same. I have seen two in my life dealing with personal issues and the one that stood out for me was not very by the book<br />She was easy to talk too and very one on one. She gave me examples that I could relate too and not just telling me what a book says.<br /><br />Alot like Paul, in fact I told her about the show and she loved it lol.<br />Paul was a therapist who was having a hard time in life ,he wasn't perfect and he wasn't a God. He was just a man who was trying to help others and I think in a way he was trying to help himself.<br /><br />He made mistakes<br />and we see the battle that he has within himself.<br /><br />I am by no means saying that what he does is always right<br />but we can't expect him too always be right<br />In fact when I see Paul , I think of many who have done a job for so long they<br />just tend to be very open and laid back about it.<br /><br />In the end he does what he is set out to do<br />help and be helped
B004APVI1G|5.0|This movie was enchanting and exciting to begin with. But the 3D version is even BETTER! You know how some movies do the upconvert thing as a gimick?  This is so not the case! They fly most of the movie, awesome for 3D....then they show all the elements: wind, fire, rain, ocean waves, giant swirls of blue magnetic magic. It is very interactive for at-home viewing. Plot reminds me a lot of the old cartoons like the Secret of Nim and so on. NO matter what your age, get this to actually let your 3D tV off of its leash.:)
B004FOA84A|5.0|I love this app it rocks so do get it plz a<br /><br />nd hi and or hello and or solo I'm hours so by mans and or woman's. good by**&#8355;$$$:)
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|With all the magical, child-like 3d movies to choose from, we finally have one that is for \\"big kids\\" haha. Its fun, 3D is cool, but movie would be jut as good without it.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|After the latest update, greader is crashing all the time.  I have to force quit and then restart the app.  I would give this four stars if it hadn't started crashing.  The app is still usable but the crashing is annoying.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The sound quality, the visual clarity, so much better than DVD or VHS! This cartoon was created to APPEAR 3D'ish when it was created, so it is perfect for this up-convert to 3D from its original 2D. You love Disney? You love 3D? You can't lose with this one!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I've been looking for games that combine the storyline, gameplay, and ambiance that made the Myst series of games such a pleasure of mine for so many years.  This game is the closest I've found so far.  The Lost City is shorter and the storyline is nonexistent.  The mood is lighter and less menacing.  And yet, the feeling of immersion is right, and the gameplay comes pretty close.  The seasons theme is excellent.  It's the only game I've gotten so far for my tablet that I would play again.
031262820X|4.0|This was a really cute story, one of Wickham's best in my opinion.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute girlie story.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This album is digital gold. I began listening to it and haven't stopped since. From start to finish, this crew has that Dilla-esque feel that manages to sound like a real jazz band rather than a commercial group of musicians following sheet music and repeating themselves. This 'experiment' actually features improvisation of the highest quality from EVERY player in the group from start to finish. Even the guest vocalists sound as if they are following the lead of the band rather than singing off of their notepad.<br /><br />The drummer is fantastic. Robert Glasper is a masterful pianist. Casey Benjamin is an amazing multi-instrumentalist. All of this comes together in an unexpected and off balance way with the amazing remake of Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". \\"Move Love\\" and \\"Cherish The Day\\" are high points as well.<br /><br />You simply can't go wrong with this album if you are a lover of jazz or R&B. Here you notice how different jazz vocalists are from regular vocalists. Being able to follow the improvisation of the band is a difficult thing to do melodically and Lalah Hathaway does it masterfully.<br /><br />GET THIS ALBUM!
0385342055|4.0|I loved this book, and the entire series.  I think this book wasn't my favorite out of the entire series, but it's cute.  I recommend it.
B0067LXQAW|4.0|A few standout tracks but nothing that special about the album.At least they didn't hang it up & live Dolores still has the vocals from the 90's.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This is a classic from my childhood.  A must-watch every holiday season.  I would recommend this as a great family movie!
B00386EZJU|5.0|I am still enjoying listening to this music- now the rest of my family is getting tired of hearing it.  I have had it over three weeks, and that is a long time for me to still be geeking out about a specific soundtrack.  I love the other instruments that John Powell brought into the score the pennywhistle and the hardanger fiddle.
0385338694|4.0|Cute story - not one of Kinsella's bests, but I enjoyed it.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute girlie book.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|I thought it was a great buy, I absolutely love this movie, I have loved it since I seen it as a young girl.<br />I would absolutely use amazon.com again
0440242401|4.0|I thought this was a really cute story.  I still prefer Kinsella's Shopaholic series to all her other books, but this one was a close runner up.
0439023521|5.0|This book is addicting from page one! I wanted to get it and have the trilogy done before the movies comes out. Definitely worth reading before seeing the movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Playing the variety of games kills the boredom factor.  I haven't unlocked all the games so far, but this should help :). I would recommend this app to any gamer
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great awesome game I love it I would def tell people about this ...no complaints at all recommend this game highly
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The pace of the first books returns in the second half of the book.<br />That is more than enough for me.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book had enough bad reviews so what could one more hurt.  It was so messed up. It was mostly a rehash of the last book!!! What a rip off.  Time had no flow to it at all so how are we suppose to keep caring about any of the characters? REALLY!!!!!
B0076T0670|5.0|Ive never quite figured out why this band isn't bigger in the USA, but that's all right.  This album is perhaps their finest hour.  As good as it gets.  I would like to see them here in the Midwest but I don't think they are headed this way.  In some respects they sound like the BRMC of the UK, but considerably better.  It's not really psychedelia but the sort of grooving, droning progressions are always interesting.  They plain and simply write great songs.  Always have really.  I heard this new album on Pandora while on my Brian Jonestown Massacre Channel.  Appropriate.  They rock.  If you haven't heard of them, americaners, listen.  Please.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I like most of the G5 games, this one is very difficult and at times impossible to use on the Kindle fire.  The fire dosen't respond to the touch screen on this game, I've touched in the same place at least 25 times in one spot in order to advance thru the levels. Bad game for the fire.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is really addicting...some of the required goals seem almost impossible but they become manageable when you buy power ups...really fun!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|We loved this movie!! Appropriate for all ages (only a couple  little cuss words by the \\"kid\\" in the movie ).I was actually surprised by some of the twists, turns and even the ending! (Don't want to give it away!). If you like movies that are triumphant, this one will leave you laughing, crying,(again, tears of triumph) and definitely shouting!
0307959856|2.0|I don't care that Jane Austen would have said fall instead of autumn (or vice versa) I don't even care that Jane Austen wouldn't have written from multiple POV, trust me Jane Austen fans are often the nitpickiest. However I do care if the book is entertaining, and Death Comes to Permberley is not. It's a very dry and dull book, best exemplified in P.D. James' version of Elizabeth who has lost her sparkling wit and keen mind and is reduced to a very one dimensional character with the personality of cardboard. James doesn't even spread out the pertinent information, it's pretty given to you much in the first seven chapters, after that it's just regurgitated over and over and over, until the last three chapters provide a \\"revelation\\" that was hardly worth the wait.<br /><br />Sorry James, I was certain since is the only really established author to take a stab at a Jane Austen sequel that she would definitely be the most sucessful, and I waited over 290 pages for you to prove me right.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|This is definately one of my ten favorite movies of all time.  I don't know if my favorite Movie Maker is Quentin Tarantino or Rob Zombie.  Brad Pitt made the movie-----I died laughing!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great time killer if you are board. I play every night before I go to bed. it is Aldo fun to play while trying to kill time.
B000063DFN|5.0|POWERSLAVE is one of the BEST moments from the METAL LEGEND IRON MAIDEN!!!!! All the songs are great, like the TOTAL CLASSICS ACES HIGH, 2 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT, RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER, BACK IN THE VILLAGE and the powerful title track!!!!! I love what MAIDEN did until 7th SON OF A 7th SON, but is until POWERSLAVE that i can say that i really enjoy ALL the songs on the album!!!!! This is from a time where IRON MAIDEN was KING in the METAL WORLD!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED, as ALL THE STUFF MAIDEN did until 7th SON!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, MAIDEN!!!!! BRAVOOOOO!!!!!!!!
0439023521|4.0|It is a good story and idea. Most post apocalyptic stories are interesting because we always wonder what our society would be like.
B000063COX|5.0|This IRON MAIDEN debut is one of the most important and remarkable moments of the heavy rock history!!! Maybe only BLACK SABBATH can be compared to the brilliant beginning of IRON MAIDEN! THIS IS REALLY A CLASSIC ALBUM, is where the MAIDEN history begins! Paul Di´anno was a great great singer in the first two MAIDEN albuns and his raw punk voice is incredible in gems like PROWLER, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and REMENBER TOMORROW. All the songs are amazing!!!! THANK YOU, IRON MAIDEN!! YOU REDEFINE PART OF THE HEAVY MUSIC HISTORY FOREVER!!!This kind of music is art!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very nice app i enjoy writing notes and it being auto synced. i definately reccomend it yo anyone looking for a notes app
B000063DFQ|5.0|PIECE OF MIND is one of the best moments from the METAL LEGEND IRON MAIDEN!!!! MAIDEN is WITHOUT ANY DOUBT one of the best bands ever, and PIECE OF MIND got some of their classic METAL GENS like THE TROOPER, WHERE EAGLES DARE, FLIGHT OF ICARUS and REVELATIONS!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED, as ALL MAIDEN albuns until 7th SON OF A 7th SON!!!!! PIECE OF MIND is a PIECE OF METAL GLORY!!!!! GO ON, IRON MAIDEN IS GONNA GETCH YOU FOREVER!!!!!!!
1569242739|5.0|Trust me, you need this cookbook. Every recipe I've tried has been amazing, and I love all the imaginative recipes (including the S'mores and Pistachio Rosewater, which are both drool-worthy). The cupcakes in the book are the absolute best. I'm not even vegan, I just love a good cupcake!
B000002LHT|5.0|BRAIN DRAIN is a good collection of punk songs from the RAMONES. It´s not one of the best albuns from the RAMONES but got the hits PET SEMATARY and I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, and great tunes like ALL SCREWED UP, ZERO ZERO UFO and LEARN TO LISTEN.
1594744769|5.0|When I picked this up, I think I was expecting something completely different, but what I found was so amazingly good that I've forgotten what that was. I haven't been as engaged by a YA book in a very long time, and I cannot wait until the sequel and movie are out!
B000002IZ4|5.0|The first two albuns from the STONE TEMPLE PILOTS will forever be in my list of great albuns from the grunge era. Scott Weiland was in great form in CORE and PURPLE and the DeLeo brothers shine. All the songs are great, with classics like VASOLINE, INTERSTATE LOVE SONG, BIG EMPTY and SILVERGUN SUPERMAN....
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best movies ever made.  It is so heartfelt, genuine and is an excellent display of God's love for us.  It kept my attention and my expectation during the movie.  And, to see men express such conviction and love for God is beautiful.  Definitely one of my top movies.
B000002L9O|5.0|I really like ANIMAL BOY, one of the many many great punk recorda the RAMONES created. The super hit SOMEBODY PUT SOMETHING IN MY DRINK, ANIMAL BOY, CRUMMY STUFF and SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN are RAMONES gems. I AM NOT THE ANIMAL BOY BUT I REALLY LIKE THIS RECORD!!!!!!!
B0068TL23G|5.0|I don't agree with posters who say it is too easy - unless you have a mensa IQ in the spatial puzzle tests. Many reviews comment that they did 16 puzzles and found them too easy or boring. You aren't giving it enough time. The first 16 are simple, but as you advance to different chapters, believe me - they do get harder. I am currently stuck on the last puzzle in Chapter 5 last puzzle (of 9 Chapters). I will put it down and come back to it - like an ornery chess game I am determined to win. I am a perfectionist though and refuse to go on unless I get all the points.<br /><br />I use mine on a Kindle Fire and though it was not very responsive using my finger, with the stylus it is more responsive.<br /><br />As for those who are frustrated because they don't like the reverse order deletes, that's part of the game challenge. It is all about memory! I like that you can't jump ahead and do the puzzles you want.<br /><br />As for those who have difficulty with memory on your phone, there is a lite version. Though I don't know how different it is and how challenging.<br /><br />If you are looking for something as flashy and fast paced as angry birds or such, you won't find it here.<br /><br />I let my 11 yo niece play many of the earlier games - she enjoyed them and I go back and delete her games so she can play them again trying to get perfect points. I even gave her the one I am stuck on because she did so well on the earlier games. Like me though, she stopped before throwing the Kindle on the floor. ;)<br /><br />It is worth what you pay for it. If you go to the Sammyland website there is a place to email them and give them feedback.<br /><br />I am looking forward to playing other versions like the Aqua.<br /><br />For those of you looking for cheats, there is a website for that, but no one is posting! You can't get it started if no one contributes.<br /><br />[...]
B000002HRE|4.0|RELOAD is another very good collection of HEAVY songs from METALLICA...There[s some great songs like SLITHER, DEVIL[S DANCE, FUEL, FIXXXER, THE MEMORY REMAINS and PRINCE CHARMING...Many people dismiss the greatness of LOAD and RELOAD, simply saying METALLICA sell out and all their new work sucks....man, that[s totally unfair!!!!! RELOAD may not be as wonderful as RIDE THE LIGHTNING and MASTER OF PUPPETS, but still is a great collection of HEAVY ROCK songs with METAL feeling!!!!! Common, you don[t really expects that METALLICA will be sounding EXACTLY the SAME after so many years....RELOAD got many great songs (some not so great)and is WAY WAY WAY better than the awful mistake St Anger....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game kept me occupied for hours, there are tons of minigames and they are all fun and exciting to play
B0000028RR|5.0|This debut from RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE must be one of most original and important albuns from the early 90´s...All the songs are great, with a great mix of rap attitude, funk metal and punk!!! KILLING IN THE NAME is one of the most classics songs of the world!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|it is more like the majong I play on computer.  It has good graphics and easeof use. It is much better than other majong apps.
B000002HMH|5.0|After many spins, and after many years since i heard LOAD for the first time, all i can say is that LOAD  IS A GREAT GREAT HEAVY ROCK ALBUM!!!!! ok, i can[t compare LOAD with past masterpieces like MASTER OF PUPPETS and JUSTICE FOR ALL, but the truth is...this new METALLICA of LOAD create great great HEAVY songs like KING NOTHING, 2 X 4, UNTIL IT SLEEPS, AIN[T MY BITCH, WASTING MY HATE and THORN WITHIN...i agree with some haters that said METALLICA sell out...yes, it[s way more polished and talks to the mainstream rock, and yes, it[s not the same RAW, FAST and FURIOUS METALLICA...but common, LOAD is from 1996, and the classic MASTER OF PUPPETS is from 1986!!!!!! METALLICA mature their METAL through the years, and LOAD is a great work mixing the old METAL with some HEAVY ROCK....man, even the TOTALLY POP ballad MAMMA SAID is beautiful!!!!! Well, after many many years, in my opinion, LOAD is a GREAT collection of HEAVY tunes from the masters of the 80[s THRASH METAL!!!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!!!!!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Finally a shoot 'em up game like Galaxia that I can control.  Fun, simple, retro!  It's also the favorite of my 22 &amp; 15 year old when they are on my phone.
B000002BPS|5.0|IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE is a great hardcore punk album!!!! in my opinion, it[s the last great album from OFFSPRING!!!!All the songs are amazing like COOL TO HATE, MOTA, ALL I WANT, GONE and MEANING OF LIFE!!!!! well, this is the last OFFSPRING album without the pop punk attitude they incorporated on future records....This one, IGNITION and SMASH are really great!!!!until IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE, OFFSPRING...WELL DONE!!!!!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said.  I'm just adding my accolades to the already thousands.  This is a really good book.  Like everyone else I couldn't put it down.  Read it in 2 days. The beginning of the story just grabs you and doesn't let go.  It is about a group of people being punished for something that happened years ago.  It's about how the group in the captial holds surpreme power over the people in the districts and deterimes their fate.  A boy and a girl from the 12 districts must battle and fight to the death and only one can survive. It is an intense novel and a page turner can't wait for the next book.

B000001IPL|5.0|SMASH is one of the most relevants albuns in the hardcore history!!!!Some say the Offspring are some kind of pop punk like blink or Green day, but i really think SMASH,the Offspring debut and IGNITION are hardcore albuns. It´s not that straight punk philosophy album, but SMASH is one of the last albuns from the early 90´s to bring what true punk is about...

She felt the exact same way. She could not stop reading and tried to slow herself down because she didn't want the book to come to an end! No author can ask for more than that nor can any reader!

0143119680|1.0|When I buy a book I read it cover to cover, no matter what. That was no easy task with this terrible book. It should have been marketed as a Harlequin type romance novel with a dark haired Fabio type on the cover holding a woman gazing at him with adoration and lust.<br />This book was supposed to be about Vampires and Witches. Really? I've read dozens of novels and stories about Vampires over the years. Some of them written even before Bram Stoker's Dracula. What I want to know is what happened to their inability to be up and about in the daytime? Shouldn't they be asleep in a coffin containing their native soil while the sun is shining? How come they can now drink wine and eat nuts instead of existing on only blood? Why are they not repelled by garlic or anything to do with Christianity such as prayers? And why are none of these new rules explained? A lot of so called \\"genetics\\" is bandied about - so did their DNA mutate? I haven't read that many books about Witches but the ones I have read don't mention any of the incredible powers that Diana is supposed to possess. Time travel - give me a break. These creatures are not true to their history in literature at all.<br />In addition, the writing is fairly amateurish and the novel is much more about their budding romance than almost anything else. If someone told me it was written by a teenage girl I would not find it hard to believe. Obviously that is the demographic that this novel is really aimed at. It makes me think that it was written to take advantage of the Twilight series. No one but a teenage girl could be interested in either.<br />And to add insult to injury the book doesn't even have an ending. It's just the first part of a trilogy which I was not aware of until it was too late. That was my mistake and I'll have to be more careful in the future. However, I'm not about to spend anymore time or money on the next two books full of this kind of nonsense.

B006ZEDZNY|1.0|I wanted to like this movie. I loved Fear and Loathing. I almost always like Johnny Depp and Aaron Eckhart and Giovanni Ribisi. But this movie was a waste of time. It felt like the director maybe shot enough film for a twenty hour movie, then chopped out pieces of it at random until it got down to 90 minutes. The whole flow of the movie was disjointed and every scene, after the first ten minutes or so, feels like it comes out of nowhere. As an example, by the end of the movie, Johnny Depp's character is almost obsessed with [spoiler] saving the newspaper (or something)[/spoiler], but we see absolutely nothing of how Depp's character goes from completely apathetic in one scene to stupidly passionate about this in the next. It comes out of nowhere, and seems really forced. I'm only guessing that there is some plausible exposition his character's evolution on a cutting room floor somewhere.<br /><br />Oh, there's also one of the most eye-rollingly bad Chekhov's Gun moments I've ever seen outside of a Harry Potter movie. I half expected Wayne Campbell to step into frame and say, \\"aren't we lucky we were there to get that information? It seemed extraneous at the time.\\"

B0067QPVJ6|4.0|Except for the lack of differing creature forms (they had human faces), this movie was superior all the way, and they tied in nicely to Carpenter's version.  I wasn't sure what happened to the female at the end, she didn't look like the suicide, and how Lars made it to the end for the tie-in I'm not sure, either.  But their logic and ideas were better than the Russell gang, even that fingernails on the chalkboard blood/heat test.<br />I love the 59 Hawks' version the best, though they are not really the same films due to the alterations from the story in the the first version.  Still, the dialogue and repartee are so good it's funny and hilarious.  The 80s film with Russell was too dour, and the shirt tearing thing was stupid, as if that meant anything.<br />Nice to see the ship in this version, too, though you don't really see much.  I wonder why they never found it or saw the videos in the 80s version?

B0000524CY|4.0|Really. For Real. Im 16, and i have heard about this movie, my whole life. I have always heard, how scary it was. Being a horror fanatic, i just had to see it. I finnaly did. I Must say, it was pretty creepy. I didnt like the whole \\"Masturbation With a Crucifix\\" thing, I found that VERY Blasphemous && Disturbing. I just turned my head at that scene. I am Very used to typical, Slasher movies, so therefor they do not scare me. BUT, Demon/Exorcism movies, are the only movies that scare me anymore. So thats why i like to watch them. Im not going to go into detail, and explain what this movie is about, because im sure about everyone has seen this movie. Possessed By a Demon, Walking down the stairs Backwards, Spinning head, Green Vomit, yeah you know the story. I don't know if this will be one that i will purchase, and add to my collection, but im glad that i finnaly got to see it.
006197806X|5.0|Delirium was my favorite book of the year back in 2010 when I read it. It surpassed every single other book that I read before it, and honestly I haven't read a book that made me feel like that since. You know that feeling I'm talking about. It's what readers live for, right? Being consumed by a story. Living and breathing it in those few hours or days that you are reading it. Books that just blow you away and leave you in awe for days afterward. That was Delirium for me. That's some back story for you, so that you understand just how much Pandemonium meant to me.<br /><br />I'm going to start off by saying this is going to be a terribly hard book to review. I don't want to spoil the first book or this book. So this will probably be vague at best. If you've read Delirium you probably have one huge question for Pandemonium. I did. It was something that I needed know. I had hoped and wished and wondered about it often in the year between reading these books. But ultimately I was surprised, but not the way I thought I was going to be. No, I was surprised that when I started this book I stopped wondering. It's a testament to Lauren Oliver's writing that she could make me forget about that burning question for awhile. I was so captivated by this new hard and scary world that Lena was living in that Alex became a afterthought. That really, really surprised me.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong he was always in my mind, because he was always in Lena's. Just glimpses and small passages full of such longing and emotion it would bring tears to my eyes. But Lena's life is very different in this book. She has became hard and so strong. Really this second book was much more about getting to know Lena. And I must say that I love what I saw. She is so complex and well written.<br /><br />There are some new characters introduced. Some I loved, some infuriated me. All of them were pivotal. Once again Oliver's writing makes me feel something that I didn't think was possible. I can't say what that is, but when you read it you will know.<br /><br />I'm almost done, I promise! The book is written in a very different kind of format. A Then and Now format. This made the book super intense. There was always some horrifying action happening. It was completely impossible to put down. As far as sequels go this is a incredible one. It's not at all what I was expecting. It ended up being so much more.<br /><br />The ending did not destroy me like Delirium`s, but I might be destroyed a different way. By questions. Lots and lots of questions. There's also a tiny bit of frustration too. Because that is not how I wanted things to play out, but I'm going to leave it in Lauren Oliver's capable hands. I trust that she will get us where we need to be in Requiem. Overall, I don't think I could have asked for a better sequel to a book that I loved beyond measure. Lauren Oliver is a master of her craft.what that is, but when you read it you will know.<br /><br />I'm almost done, I promise! The book is written in a very different kind of format.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|What's awesome about this movie is that it is entertaining for all ages. My daughter, she will be 3 in a couple of months, is a huge fan of this movie. In fact, we introduced her to Hello Dolly because of her familiarity with the music. I also cannot think of anything that would get me to like a cockroach in any way shape or form like Wall-E did. This film has great humor, stunning graphics, and adorable characters. If you haven't already seen this, you are missing out on a terrific film!

B005UKJX4E|1.0|I see some artistic value in this movie, and I get the metaphores they put forward, but overall, this movie was a dud.  I found myself thinking \\"OK, get to the end please!\\"  No redeeming value in the end to stick around for, so if you are \\"hanging in there just in case it gets better\\" I say give it up and do something else with your time, don't waste it waiting to see if it gets better, it doesn't.  And I thought with Brad Pitt and Sean Penn it couldn't be that bad, but that was an error.  Some of the photography is beautiful, but you can see that elsewhere, and in much less time.

My favorite cut is Hang My Tears Out To Dry.

But when that ordeal is seen through the eyes of a District Attorney who knows all the ins and outs of police investigation and courtroom maneuvering, a person who knows the personalities of the presiding judge and prosecuter, a person who knows the imperfections of our jury system, you are presented with a breathtaking glimpse into the destruction of a life and of a family.
B000MV90B2|5.0|The 1970 movie \\"Waterloo\\" is available on DVD in this 2010 Castaway Pictures edition.  Picture quality is only average, but well worth it.  Rod Steiger heads a solid cast as Napoleon, Emperor of France, joined by Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington, his English nemesis.<br /><br />\\"Waterloo\\" is a full-scale dramatization of the decisive 1815 battle, as Napoleon returns from enforced exile for one last run at glory as French Emperor.  The movie offers the spectacle of hundreds of properly uniformed extras marching and charging around a Waterloo battlefield, accompanied by lots of artillery fire and backed by a stirring musical score.  The narrative highlights different individuals on both sides, but the focus is on Napoleon and his primary adversary Wellington.  The action sequences can be hard to follow, but the movie builds to a gripping sense of suspense at the crisis of the battle, as Napoleon's vaunted Old Guard makes its final assault on British lines and as the Prussian army arrives on the field.<br /><br />\\"Waterloo\\" is not a precise reenactment.  It is more like a highlight reel; sharp-eyed students of the battle will recognize a number of key events and anecdotes on screen.  The Dutch and German troops in Wellington's army are ignored; Blucher's Prussians get little screen time.  The emphasis is on the psychological duel between a fading, physically ailing and increasingly desperate Napoleon and the cool, tough, aloof aristocrat Wellington.  Steiger and Plummer succeed in their characterizations.<br /><br />\\"Waterloo\\", made in the wake of the battle's 150th anniversay, was intended for an audience generally familiar with its importance.  It is still recommended to that audience.  This reviewer saw the movie in its original theatrical release, and still finds it a thrill to watch.
B005EM8O8O|4.0|I gave this book four stars rather than five because I save five stars for literary fiction.  This book is clearly aimed at the wider audience of those who simply read for fun.  Some of the critics cite their inability to connect with the main characters.  This is a thriller, it is plot, pacing and the build up of suspense that keep the pages turning.  I loved the quotes from Darwin's \\"Origin Of Species\\" that preface many of the chapters as it foreshadows the evolutionary dangers unchecked autonomous machine learning i.e. Artificial Intelligence.  Looking forward to the inevitable movie adaptation.
B0063IH60K|4.0|a lot of fun.  You win often enough to not get frustrated. it is challenging and it is an easy to use app._!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This is a wonderful, old fashioned movie that isn't about something that most people care much about:  Bird watching.  Or \\"birding\\" as they call it.<br /><br />Nothing huge happens.  No continents fall into the ocean.  No aliens land.  No international crime lords captured.  Just a charming film about three men, each of whom hopes to be the one to spot the most bird species during a one-year period.<br /><br />There are subplots, but they aren't really so important.  Each man has a \\"real life\\" that intrudes a bit.  One has a father who disapproves and a job that must be attended to periodically.  One has a wife who wants to get pregnant, and the husband just isn't around much.  And one is trying to retire from a company that just can't seem to adjust to his being gone.<br /><br />All that said, what the movie is really about is the passion, the absolute love, for birds that birders display.  Really, it is an obsession.<br /><br />I am married to a birder, and, yes, we might get a phone call on vacation that a special bird was spotted only 500 miles from where we are (and 10000 ft in altitude difference) and why don't we dash over and see it.....  It can be trying for the non-birder (me).  But how wonderful that a group of people can have an obsession, a real love, for something so simple, lovely, and harmless.<br /><br />I found the film true to life, and really enjoyable.  The combination of Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and Steve Martin was genius.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is a fun logic game that can be for a quick play or longer.  not too difficult but does make you think.
B000002LAC|5.0|I will not repeat the preceding (at this time) over 60 reviews praising in detail this work of art.  I have always loved these three voices individually, and was in sound and music heaven when this was released. All three are well reversed in traditional country music, as were as americana music, and it shows here. Their voices go together so well, it is like they have been singing as a group all their life. There choice of songs such as 'Wildflowers\\" and \\"Hobo\\" add to the perfection of this album.<br /><br />This is a \\"listen to\\" album, the melodies and the vocals blending so well, you tap your feet or just sit and listen to the lyrics. I myself often listen to it on my back porch, my neighbors many times asking \\"who is that\\", (they are 20 years younger then me, so they must be educated!).<br /><br />If you are fan of these fine ladies, (Ronstadt, Harris, Parton), you must get this. This is one of those landmark perfomances that will stand the test of time. Highly recommended.

B004YW4L5K|4.0|American Gods was a very interesting book and my first introduction into Neal Gaiman. The book can be read without much or any understanding about various cultural gods but there's definitely some added appreciation to be had if you either know the stuff already or take the time to look up some details about the god's he discusses. The book largely follows a somewhat benign ex-convict who as he leaves prison for a short term stay for assault and battery only to find out that two days before he's released, the love of his life, Laura, is killed in a car accident. It's here where we pick up Shadow's story and he makes a very unusual acquaintance on the plane trip back to bury his wife.<br /><br />This passenger turns out to be one of the gods who has a job for Shadow which Shadow eventually accepts. The book slowly draws you into this increasingly supernatural world where the old gods that have been brought over by the many cultures who inhabit America find themselves in conflict with the new gods Americans have created themselves (Lust, Greed, TV, Town, etc). I really don't think I could do it a whole lot more justice by going into more detail and I certainly wouldn't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that this was a very unique story that mostly held my attention, but took my quite a bit longer to churn through than most books do.<br /><br />That being said, I think it's also one that will stick with me longer than some of the \\"fast food\\" type novels I've read every now and then as well. I will say that while there were passages that sort of sputtered a bit in places while the story tried to figure out how to get from one part to the next, there was a fair amount of twists and surprises that made parts of the story very engaging. All in all, the book is well written if a bit slow at times, a bit difficult to follow in places but still very interesting and when it was finished I enjoyed a nice sense of satisfaction of knowing that I had completed a well written story with a lot of heart and one that will have me reflecting for some time.<br /><br />Probably not a book that every person will appreciate equally, but definitely one I would recommend.n story with a lot of heart and one that will have me reflecting for some time.<br /><br />Probably not a book that every person will appreciate equally, but definitely one I would recommend.

B007E6YYLO|4.0|Sure, there are some zombies and gore, and some drama, but the drama should flesh out the action, not the other way around. See Rick running on the image of this Season? Run, Rick, Run! That's what should have happened from episode 2 or 3 . . . RUN AWAY!!! Rig up some \\"Trollhunter\\" quality vehicles, make like a baby, and head out!<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER FINAL EPISODE OF THIS SEASON: Okay, they've nearly redeemed themselves. A couple details I overheard at work lead me to finish the season, and turns out it ain't quite so bad. But if they end up staying put only one hour away from the farm for the entirety of Season 3, I'll have to take away a star. Just sayin's, all. They still need some Trollhunter trucks, though.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|When I bought Darkness in 1978 on the day of its release, I went home and listened to it for hours. Days, really. For me, 22 years old and working in a garage, it felt very personal. Now, after hearing The Promise, I wish some of these songs had not been left on the shelf. The Promise, Racing In the Street (1978), Candy's Boy and Breakaway could have easily fit into this album, both in terms of mood and quality. Could you imagine if the song 'The Promise', with its echoes of Thunder Road, had led off this long awaited album three years after Born to Run and all of the ensuing legal hassle?!? There are other strong songs, obviously Fire and Because the Night among others, which are good but probably would not have fit on Darkness. And, there are other songs which have that 'River' feel which I was never crazy about (i.e. 'Sherri Darling'). For me, this is a 5 because of those 4 songs I mentioned first. Overall, and to others, maybe not so much, but for me it was great finding what really amounted to new Darkness tracks all these years later.
B004R6JQLC|4.0|Let me preface by saying I am not an audiophile or d.j., but a reasonably new film editor. That's how I used these headphones. That said. The AKG k240's served me for at least 3 years before they started to break down. I was suggested these headphones from my sound teacher they were my first pro headphones and will always have a warm spot for that. However, that said 3 years is not a long time. The first year they were used for classes only. However, when it came down to it they had a much fuller sound then any non-pro headphones I'd been recommended.<br /><br />+/- the detachable chord made keeping these babies safe easier (do not forget to remove this, the contacts on mine disconnected and i had to physically hold the contact in to hear. Like a dj right? no not funny aggravating).<br /><br />+rests comfortably on my head. The band fits really comfortably<br /><br />+In the entire time I've used it I have never heard complaints on leakage.<br /><br />+My wife is probably not a fan of the noise cancellation \\"Honey where's the bill\\" \\"Check out my new headphones\\" \\"The Bill\\" \\"What!\\" (yeah its excellent. Don't tell her I called her noise)<br /><br />+/- comes with alternate jacks for 1/4 in. and headphones which was great for me so i could edit on my laptop and take them to my school's editing bay and use them there as well. However downside was there was no carrying pouch or anything that I could use to bring this baby with me. So if you're anything like me the temptation unless you're trained is to leave the 1/4 in. in random places you have to run back to. It's not a good travel friend.<br /><br />WHAT BROKE DOWN:<br />I apologize if I'm not exact in the names, but the housing over one ear started to pop off. I've popped it back in, but with repeat uses it became easier to pop off. Leather earphones have since cracked. Chord has become frayed. Now I'm not saying I glossed these with leather protectant and put them on the shelf, but wear and tear of running around shooting, editing movies and listening to playback has taken its toll on these old friends of mine.<br /><br />I understand this isn't the most thoroughly technically minded review however I hope for those of you unfamiliar with the product hearing something will be a benefit. Thanks For you time!oting, editing movies and listening to playback has taken its toll on these old friends of mine.<br /><br />I understand this isn't the most thoroughly technically minded review however I hope for those of you unfamiliar with the product hearing something will be a benefit.

B001MRMRS8|5.0|When I started collecting complete opera recordings on CD in early 90's, the general feeling was that the golden age of opera revival was long gone.  Critics bemoaned the absence of great tenors (Corelli, Vickers), sopranos (Callas, Nillsen), and the general euphoria that ensued every time one of the big names would take center-stage.  However, to my ears, delighted by the new media after having to put up with hissy LPs, it was the 80's that signified a \\"golden age\\".  The legendary 3 Tenors were all making great recitals and recordings, several great sopranos were still very much active, and the ADD and early DDD sound was light years better than what I was used to.  Fast-forward almost 20 years.  Just when I was beginning to think I'll never buy another new recording, these young stars changed my mind with their skill, charm, and a totally new way of music-making.  Netrebko and Villazon can literally sing upside down.  And they sing wonderfully while at it.  The Russian soprano had humble beginnings, but thanks to Valery Gergiev matured into a great diva.  Not in a \\"classic\\" sense, i.e. stand-up-and-sing, but in a modern sense - working with the material, exploring the character from new angles and acting with her whole body, not just the voice.  She's exceedingly lovely to behold, and (which is more rare) just as lovely to hear.  Even after listening over headphones sans video I could not detect any shrillness - just beautifully produced wave of silk, if I could indulge in such a metaphor. I could not help but feel for Violetta all over again, from the moment she softly murmured \\"E strano...\\".<br />It's no secret that DG skillfully exploits operating partnerships.  And it's okay, when we're talking about Netrebko and Villazon.  I must say they sound wonderful together.  Villazon's tenor is decidedly masculine, there isn't a trace of tender-cherubic cuteness, it's a voice most readily resembling Placido Domingo's, if a size smaller.  By the way, smaller voices aren't problematic, they're actually more \\"phonogenic\\" so to speak.  An interesting piece of trivia: the optional high note at the end of \\"O mio remorso\\" somehow sounding fake on famous Kleiber set with Domingo isn't sung by Villazon here, but if you watch the documentary included as a bonus - he can sing it alright, and very well, too, impressing Thomas Hampson as he looks on.  Speaking of Hampson - why is he considered a weak link of this ensemble?  I must say his voice is still marvelous, as is his lieder-singer's breath control, required for Verdian singing.  He is not a typical stentorian baritone, often associated with Germont-pere, but he is very moving and he acts his character it in a completely mesmerizing way, you can't help wondering \\"who is this man?  Is he deranged or really wants to do good, or both?\\"<br />This brings me to the production.  It's definitely challenging.  Willy Decker took a lot of liberties with the story, and a viewer used to traditional staging will be taken aback almost right away.  Well, aside from poor Dr. Grenvill made to look like death himself, I was excited to see the new angles of a familiar story.  It fell apart a bit with the scene when Alfredo asks Annina where Violetta is, but the rest is quite effective.  Even the large clock, often considered a clich&eacute;, works well when turned into a gambling table.  Most of all, this staging allows the principals to freely display their talents, and that's an achievement.  Plus, in the second act Netrebko and Villazon really look adorable when frolicking around the \\"bedroom\\", you really believe that they're a couple madly in love.  I always felt that Alfredo just standing alone in the middle of the stage singing \\"Dei miei bollenti spiriti\\" was woefully inadequate, some context was needed.<br />Overall, this is a must-have.  In fact, I can't think of any other new opera recording that would serve as a testament to the art longevity as does this one.  As a final note: blu-ray technologyreally shines here: it makes the performance quite literally come alive before your eyes.y shines here: it makes the performance quite literally come alive before your eyes.
0316017930|5.0|Want to be world-class at something? Malcolm bares the realities about what it takes to be world-class. If you're not willing to invest the time, effort, and energy, it's not just going to happen. The 10,000 hour rule is something that most budding entrepreneurs and many young people are simply unwilling to admit. If you work a 2,000 hour year like most Americans do, that means it will take at least five years to be world-class at your craft. Excellent examples, well-written, and thought-provoking. Recommended for high schoolers and college students to set their expectations properly before they enter the workforce.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" starts off a little slow.  As a matter of fact, I started to read it, got bored, and put it down for a couple of months.  In the meantime, I kept hearing what a great book this was once you get past the beginning.  I decided to give it another try.  I'm sure glad I did.  At times, it's a little hard to follow and remember all of the foreign names and places, but it's an excellent read.  I couldn't put it down.  When I finished it, I immediately got the two sequels.  Unlike a lot of sequels, which are often a disappointment after the first good book or movie, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked a Hornet's Nest\\" were just as good as the first.  At times, the subject matter is more than a little gruesome, but all three are must reads for anyone who likes a book that keeps them on the edge of their seat!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I've never been a fan of Tony Bennett, but now I am.  He can really sing, and his duet album with many of today's top performers is nothing short of amazing. I've listened to it every day since I got it.  I particularly liked his duet with Lady Gaga (\\"The Lady is a Tramp\\").  She is really a great singer and performer, and even Tony Bennett said she has real talent.
1846554071|3.0|1Q84 is a novel by Haruki Murakami, split over three volumes. Books 1 and 2 were first published in Japan in 2009, with the third volume appearing the following year. All three volumes were published in English in 2011 - Books 1 and 2, translated by Jay Rubin, were published as a single volume, with the third - translated by Philip Gabriel - following a couple of weeks later. The title is nod to George Orwell's 1984; the letter in Japanese is (I'm told) pronounced the same way as the number 9.<br /><br />1Q84 opens in April 1984, and features two lead characters - Aomame and Tengo; chapter by chapter, the focus alternates between them. We meet Aomame, a 30 year old fitness instructor and part-time assassin, first. As the book opens, she's in the back of a taxi on her way to a very important 'appointment' - though, unfortunately, stuck in traffic. Her helpful taxi driver suggests she hops out onto the freeway, climbs down an emergency stairway and catches the metro instead. Aomame does as he suggest, but she doesn't leave the cab without receiving a few cryptic words of advice. After climbing down the stairs, these words come back to her when she starts noticing how the world around her has changed. At first, it's a subtle change to the police uniform that catches her attention - but not all the changes she notices are so minor.<br /><br />Tengo, meanwhile, teaches Maths in a cram school, and writes fiction part-time. When he first appears, he's discussing a story called \\"Air Chrysalis\\" with Komatsu, his editor. \\"Air Chrysalis\\", written by seventeen year old girl called Fuka-Eri, has been entered in a competition organised by Komatsu's magazine - and Tengo is keen for it to be included on the shortlist. Komatsu was also impressed with it, but has slightly different ideas : he sees the story's potential, but wants Tengo to provide a little extra finesse and re-write the book. Although Fuka-Eri agrees, they'll have to keep their involvement very quiet; the level of Komatsu's and Tengo's involvement would cause a huge scandal in the literary world. (Fuka-Eri herself is stunningly beautiful, though a little...odd).<br /><br />It's a little difficult, initially, to see how the Tengo and Aomame could have any connection. However, not only are they both playing with fire, it's practically the same flame.<br /><br />I'd really been looking forward to 1Q84, but Volumes 1 and 2 seemed a little aimless - in fact, some sections were really unconvincing. At times, though, the writing and the characters were weak. Aomame's lousy opinion of men, especially early in the book, was practically clichéd. (The fact she had a self-defence class where she taught women how to kick men in the balls *did* make me laugh, though). However, Tengo was a little more difficult to take seriously. Despite his many talents - a maths whizz-kid at school, a noted judo fighter, a natural gift for music and now a budding author - he came across as just being gormless. (His conversational skills weren't great - as the book progresses, he spends more and more time simply repeating what the other person just said. His constant perving over Fuka-Eri's chest was also very cringeworthy - but his sudden realisation that he loved Aomame was frankly ridiculous. She hadn't crossed his mind in twenty years, and all of a sudden he swoons ?) However, at no point did I ever consider throwing it aside. Overall, it was very readable, enjoyable despite its flaws (and length) and I'd no hesitation about launching straight into Volume 3.
B005LHO274|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers - easily the best astronomy app I've seen so far for the Android. I particularly like the summary tables you can view for each object (rise/set etc) PLUS a very handy visual guide that shows you when it's above the horizon - not just for today, but throughout the year. It looks great.<br /><br />It'll work on my Optimus Slide fine (although it's a little tricky to operate and read on small cell phone screen) but it's not compatible with the Kindle Fire. I'm dying for it to be available on the Fire because I know it would simply look gorgeous. I would happily ditch the other astronomy apps and just keep this, because it is quite literally an all-in-one app. You simply won't need any others.
0385342063|4.0|I was totally addicted to the Shopaholic books and am still secretly hoping for another one.  Poppy in I've Got Your Number reminded me a lot of Becky and this book was the same light, happy kind of book.  I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone.  If you generally like Kinsella's books, you'll like this one too!  This book kept making me think how much better some \\"chick lit\\" books are than chick flicks.  Couldn't put it down and was sad when it was over!<br />My only complaint is that it isn't the best for the kindle fire.  Like others said, it's a pain that all of the footnotes are at the end of the chapter.  You can click on the footnote on the text to go to the footnotes and then return to the text.  However, I would get so frustrated clicking on the footnote link only to have my kindle go to the next page or go back to the page, because it wasn't reading where I was pushing well.  Super annoying.
B00001NFCY|2.0|For a while Creed fell out of popularity, but I don't care about things like that.  These songs are good for people that are just getting into music, like teenagers.  Like so many other bands in popular music, I think to myself; Where is justice?  These bands are not much better than average and they are raking in millions, while many virtuosos can barely afford their clothes.  Frankly, these songs are just too simple for me to get much enjoyment out of them.  I listen to these songs maybe 3 times and am sick of them until a few years later.  Then, I get bored and put it back in the player and reminisce.
0320081060|2.0|I was looking for this book and all I could find was the junior edition.  I finally thought I had found an adult/complete version, but I was wrong.  The picture is wrong, the ISBN number is wrong and even the date published is wrong to the book that I actually received.  It is still the junior edition!  On the bright side it is in very good condition, but I would have wished that it was advertised correctly.
B0012E6R3W|3.0|Testament should be classified as either speed metal, or progressive metal.  I like that their vocalist does more than just the standard Cookie Monster voice.  The guitars are really good, both in sound and from a technical aspect.  I recommend any of the solo efforts of Testament's revolving cast of guitarists.  So what's wrong with this album that it only got 3 stars?<br />By now I have heard several Testament albums.  I am an older fan of theirs though I have not been listening to them since the beginning.  Testament never puts out the same album over and over again.  Every album is a new effort, and progressive.  This one happens to have more of the throaty vocals instead of sung vocals, and I like sung vocals better.<br />Testament has put out several albums that have better song craftsmanship like Low, The Gathering, and The Ritual, all of which I would give a higher recommendation for.  By the time of this album, I am starting to really grow tired of triggered drums.  When I hear triggered drums, I think, \\"Why even bother having a drummer?  You might as well have a beat box make the music.\\"  Triggered drums just plain blow.  There is no dynamics to them.  When Testament started out, their albums were much rawer because they didn't have triggered drums.  I also think compression subtracts from the sound of this album.  Use of compression, just to make every song louder is a trend that I wish would die.  I like loud music, but I also like dynamics, and when the guitarists use compression, and the drummer uses triggered drums, albums lose their edge.  Maybe I'm just an old fart, but I think it's time to go back to the roots of metal, when it was much rawer, and had less production.  When every album is produced the same way, a new metal album becomes same old same old.

I feel amazing - brain fog decreased, better thinking, less itchy, more energy, less snacking, smaller portions needed to feel full, lost a couple lbs.  After 1 week, I went from fatigued and heavy-feeling to registering for a 5K.  I credit this book for helping me get this far - it is a great read and the author's claims are well-referenced. Going wheat-free wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.  I cannot recommend this book or this approach enough.  Try it for 2 weeks - you've got nothing to lose.

0385523394|4.0|Pros:  the book has a lot of authentic moments that are more descriptive and a good way to expose people to the a gentle version of the prison system<br />Cons:  this may be personal preference, but the author spends a lot of time talking about the hardships others face, but the book ends when she was released.  I have to ponder if perhaps the reason there is no follow up to what it was like after prison is that she wasn't that hard off.<br />Overall, the read was a moving, intriguing, biography

There is a little night light and my little girl loves to stare at it (8 months old). We have an Ikea cot so the frame is quite thin but I can see why this might not fit bulky framed and asymmetrical bed frames. 2 sound options and options to have the mobile turn or not and just to have the music, etc. Well worth the price. I do  not use the remote, I just walk in the room or let it turn off on its own.

B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I am on my second Mobee charger and I have been emailing back and forth with their support team in China all week and I finally figured out what was wrong with the Mobee design. My story:  I got this for Christmas and it worked the first time I tried it after charging it. I didn't use my MAC for a week and when I turned it on again, the Mouse did not work. I recharged the battery overnight and tried it again in the morning but it still did not work so I figured I would take the battery pack out, put it back in and see what happened. This leads me to the first design flaw which has been talked about here already:  I could not get the battery pack out. I tried and tried and was afraid I would break it until finally, about a week later I pulled as hard as I could and the battery pack finally came out. It was ridiculous how hard I had to pull to get this out of the mouse.  So then, I put it back in, try it, take it out and put it in and each time the mouse will not turn on. I then tried the two double A batteries and the mouse turned on like a champ. So, I bring it back to Best Buy and they give me a new one (the last one. Apparently it is now discountinued). But, the best part is still to come...  I get the new one, bring it home, charge it over night, and it does not work. Now I am out of ideas. I spent all week working over email with the Mobee support who was very responsive and they really tried to help me. I mean, it's just a mouse, right?  How hard can it be? One suggestion they had was to pull down on the little metal prong that connects to the battery so that it is not pressed totally up against the Mobee battery (they sent me a screen shot). I did this and nothing happened. So then, I tried it again and guess what!  The mouse turned on! It worked! For about 20 seconds. I then opened the mouse again and figured maybe one more small adjustment would do it and when I removed the battery, the little metal piece I had moved had broken straight off.<br /><br />In summary: my Magic Mouse is scratched up, I can't find the original back cover and a replacement is 25 bucks, the Mobee charger is broken and I am outside of the 30 day return policy. Mobee told me to bring it back to the retailer but this is not Best Buy's problem. Hopefully they will give me a refund. My recommendation is to buy a value pack of Duracel batteries and forget this nonsense. I have wasted an incredible amount of time trying to get a mouse to work with my shiny new Mac Book. I bought a MAC because I was tired of cheap accessories and I wanted things to be simple. Instead, I got stuck with a broken Mobee charger.<br /><br />One last thing:  For the price we pay for the Magic Mouse, it should be rechargeable anyway without Mobee add on products. But I will get off my soap box now.
B006O5YI7G|4.0|I liked the traditional western \\"quest for redemption\\" plot line set in a non traditional setting.  Maybe a little light on action but plenty going on plot-wise to keep you interested.  Visually it reminded me of the (1969) Wild Bunch or probably any other Peckinpah  western.  Definitely much higher quality acting and cinematography than most recent movies in this genre.
0446563048|3.0|This is a very interesting book. It is hard to tell whether it just tells the story of a company on the cutting edge of how to do things \\"right\\", or whether it is cheerleading Zappos, or giving insight on how companies should be ran for the benefit of all involved. I would have given more stars if it had more or some detail on how companies could implement their strategy of governance in various sizes of companies and industries. God knows that there are many companies who just plain suck on so many levels that they could at least try some ideas to make things better for employees and customers in the long run. If you are a company owner of high level exec you could probably read between the lines and figure out how to use some of what Zappos does to make your business better. Just wish it had more details. It is quite possible that it was intended to be this way though. More companies should find a balance to make life more pleasant for its workers and think outside what is normal or standards of industry.

006197806X|5.0|My Thoughts:<br />Last year I was fascinated by DELIRIUM. The book was amazing. But, it left you with such a cliff hanger that you would do whatever to get book #2, which ended up being PANDEMONIUM.<br />You always wonder \\"Where will book #2 go?\\" \\"Is it going to be as good as book #1?\\"<br />You need not worry about any of those questions. PANDEMONIUM was one of those book that you just did not want to set down. You will want your eyes to read faster and faster.<br />Each page is full of something that will make you literally say \\"Oh..My..God\\" yes. That good.<br />Amor Deliria Nervosa, is what everyone is so afraid of. To fall in love. To have feelings at all. Because really any kind of \\"emotion\\" can lead to Amor Deliria Nervosa.<br />Lena is out, in the Wilds. Wondering about Alex, who she left at that fence, bleeding. Is he alive? She always wonders this. She pushes herself to be stronger, better. Everything that Alex would have wanted to be to survive out in the Wilds.<br />Living out there is not easy. It's rather a day by day thing. Always wondering what is going to happen tomorrow.<br />Now an Invalid, Lena has so many challenges in front of her.<br />No one will be who they seem to be. No one.<br />PANDEMONIUM will leave you utterly speechless page after page.<br />Your heart will break, over and over. Then just when you think... \\"sigh, relief\\"<br />Oliver will rip your heart right out of your chest, and leave you there looking at the last words in the book... thinking \\"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\\" (well at least that is what I said, a long with some other things......)<br />PANDEMONIUM will fill in all the pieces of your heart DELIRIUM ripped out. Then PANDEMONIUM will leave you utterly speechless... and wanting / needing / screaming & pleading for book #3.

0374275637|5.0|It seems many of the reviewers did not read the last chapter where the author takes pains to explain that what is usually true is not always true and his system 1 and system 2 concept does not exist but is just a short cut to explain how we make decisions. He even explains briefly why and points to how one can deepen ones understanding of the issues and complexities. It contains many powerful explanations by a psychologist with descriptions of experiments many of them famous to understand how we fool ourselves.  Many of the examples are already part of our culture and some of the ideas do go back to the ancient Greeks. It does provide lots of ideas to help individuals and policy makers improve decision making and outcomes for our world.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I really enjoyed Ms. Hamilton's writing style and her attention to detail.  When I heard about The Forever Girl, I was excited but apprehensive about the main character (Sophie) being Wiccan. I was blown away; every assumption about the story line I had was shattered, the end result far superseded the blurb on the back of the novel.<br />  Ms. Hamilton has a knack for transporting the reader into the environment and making it feel like I was right there the whole time.  When I started the novel I was so absorbed in the suspense of what was unfolding with Sophie and Charles I couldn't (and didn't) put the book down till I finished it.<br />  I would compare The Forever Girl, to being similar to Lacey Weatherford's Of Witches and Warlocks, and Twilight by Stephanie Meyer.<br />  It was completely unique in the sense that Ms. Hamilton takes a completely new-to-me spin on immortality.  While some of the characters are what you would normally think of as `traditional' immortal beings, Sophie is a new unique spin (without giving too much away).  Ms. Hamilton's characters are all very unique and complex, so even the antagonists that you'd love to hate, you can't.  You understand their reasoning and in their own way, they are not villains but just characters that thru past events have evolved; motivated by power, love, survival.<br />  This novel will knock your socks off and keep you on your toes the whole time.  The one thing I hate about discovering a series at its beginning is the wait that you have to endure for the next part to come out!  It is like waiting for the next Harry Potter book to be released, just to find out what happens to the characters that have become integral parts of your life.  Will we stay together with Charles and will we both survive?  How much will Lauren be apart of our upcoming battle?  Will Adrian find someone to love and that loves him?  What is to become of the twins as well as the others?  The waiting will be pure torture but I am sure that whichever way Ms. Hamilton takes Sophie's story, it will far supersede all of my expectations.t whichever way Ms. Hamilton takes Sophie's story, it will far supersede all of my expectations.

0061765236|2.0|I have read most of Jodi's books and this was the most disappointing one of all. I found it to be a bit draggy and melodramatic and only to find out that Em committed suicide because she was pregnant?!! Considering the family loved the idea of them falling in love and being family friends, I didnt see why Em would be so upset abotu being pregnant and its not as if the two families hated each other (aka Romeo and Juliet). So I found Em's character not having common sense and too dramatic. Aside from this though I did enjoy reading about the beginnings of both of their parents relationship, the same timing of pregnancies etc which explains the 2 stars rating otherwise it would have been a one star rating.But other than that I would not re-read this book at all unlike other books Jodi wrote.
0861714911|5.0|Researchers believe that \\"The Buddha\\" ( a term meaning \\"The Awakened One\\" ) was an actual man named Siddhartha Gautama that lived in India over 2,600 years ago.<br /><br />His teachings were passed down for several centuries after his death via an oral tradition until they were written down on collections of palm leaves.  These are stored in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon, the texts of the oldest surviving form of Buddhism known as Theravada.  The Sutta Pitaka consists of 5 \\"Nikayas\\" or books/collections.<br /><br />These collection are thousands of pages long, contain much repetitive content and have only been translated into English as of the 19th century.  Translations into English are still being perfected as ancient Pali and modern English are extremely different languages.<br /><br />In other words, the reader who wants to read the Buddhist message for him/herself has the daunting task of combing through several large, expensive, repetitious volumes of translations that may not be clear to a modern reader.<br /><br />\\"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon\\" is an anthology of the Buddha's teachings compiled by Bhikkhu Bodhi.  Bhikkhu Bodhi was born in New York City in 1944 as Jeffrey Block.  He is an American Theravada Buddhist monk.  Bhikkhu Bodhi has translated large portions of the Pali Canon himself and is a native English speaker.<br /><br />His goal in compiling his anthology is to make the Buddha's message more accessible to the ordinary person and to encourage the ordinary person to read the Pali Canon themselves.<br /><br />To this end, he has chosen what he thinks are the most essential of the Buddha's  discourses.  Bhikkhu Bodhi has also put these suttas ( discourses from the Buddha ) into a logical order by subject in his anthology -- something which doesn't exist in the Pali Canon, which is a scattered, repetitious collection of separate talks.<br /><br />Bhikkhu Bodhi further aids the reader by reducing the repetition of phrases in the translations ( left over from the oral tradition ) and Bhikkhu Bodhi introduces each section with some extremely helpful essays on the suttas that follow.<br /><br />The result is an easy to understand, scholarly anthology that gives the reader a sense of what can be found in the Sutta Pitaka in regards to the essentials of the Buddha's message  - without having to make the larger investment of going through the significantly more voluminous, repetitious and expensive English translations of these collections.<br /><br />This book will likely not be enjoyable to people whose exposure to Buddhism has been a mixture of inspirational poetry, psychological analysis and elements borrowed from other spiritual traditions.<br /><br />People who are uncomfortable reading text that is more \\"religious\\" will find those elements in this collection.<br /><br />Bhikkhu Bodhi has striven to given an honest snap shot of what someone can expect to find in  translations of the Pali Canon.  That snap shot includes the presence of preternatural beings, mythical realms and what is commonly known in the West as \\"reincarnation\\".  If you have limited tolerance for reading such things, this book isn't for you.<br /><br />This book can also be dry in many sections.  It isn't a book that can be read, or understood by reading through it in many large chunks while laying on a couch after a taxing day.  My  recommendation would be to read it a tiny bit of time, sitting up and during your best hours to get the most out of it.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that a copies of the \\"The Peg\\" (Ani Sutta, Samyutta Nikaya XX.7), \\"The Unconjecturable\\" (Acintita Sutta, Anguttara Nikaya IV.77) and  \\"To Sivaka\\"  (Moliyasivaka Sutta, Samyutta Nikaya XXXVI.21) suttas (discourses from the Buddha ) were not included in this anthology.<br /><br />These suttas state that the Buddha knew his teachings would get distorted over time, that the<br />Buddha believed that ordinary people couldnot explain the details of their current situation by tracing their karma ( kamma ) and that not all situations a person encounters in their lives are the result of karma.  These are extremely important ideas and it is a bit strange that they are not included in an anthology of essential teachings attributed to the Buddha himself.<br /><br />As stated previously, a big problem for those seeking to understand Buddhism directly from the original texts is that these texts haven't been translated very well into English.  English and Pali are just very different languages. The modern world is also very different from the ancient world from where the texts came.<br /><br />Given that Bhikkhu Bodhi is an American and a native English speaker I had different expectations for these translations than what I read.<br /><br />As an example, throughout the anthology the root causes of \\"suffering\\" are listed as being \\"greed, hatred and delusion\\".  The terms in quotes are not the only possible English translations.  The English translations are technically correct, but I believe the terms used hold extreme connotations to the contemporary English speaker which rob the Buddhist message of its meaning and relevance to contemporary life.<br /><br />Many people interpret \\"suffering\\" as agony, \\"greed\\" as extreme desire, \\"hatred\\" as an extremely strong emotion and \\"delusion\\" as close to being insane.  Other translators have stated that the Pali word \\"dukha\\", commonly translated as \\"suffering\\" really refers to any dissatisfactory feeling from a vague sense of things not being the best as they could be on one end,  to flat out agony on the other end.<br /><br />So, an alternate translation like this one is possible:<br /><br />\\"The root cause of feelings of unhappiness, distress or suffering come from desire, aversion or being ignorant to the nature of life.\\"<br /><br />To me, that speaks to me much more as a modern person and seems relevant to many more of my experiences than:<br /><br />\\"The roots of suffering are greed, hatred and delusion\\".<br /><br />The alternative translation doesn't come off as a recycled puritanism of which I want no part of as a secular person.<br /><br />There are a number of other examples of alternative translations like this one.<br /><br />I'm not a scholar of any kind and Bhikkhu Bodhi is.  As an expert who has devoted his life to Buddhism I wouldn't be surprised to learn Bhikkhu Bodhi is correct in his translation choices.<br /><br />I'm just saying my preference would have been for the other choices and I think that will be true for many people interested in this book.<br /><br />I believe this book to be a first of its kind in what does and how well it does it.  I heartily encourage anyone with an interest in Buddhism to endure the shortcomings of the book.  Read it in little bits every day, read the whole thing and talk to people about it.  Such an investment will keep coming back to you for the rest of your life.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Since grade school, high school and college, I have never been a huge fan of reading.  Recently, with the birth of a child, a believe reading is key.  So, I've taken on a few books.  I'm not a fast reader due to a small learning deficiency. I have taken on four books and each has taken me about 3 to 4 months per book.  This book took me by storm.  I ordered it on a Saturday and finished in on a Tuesday.  Wow!!!!  I have never been so engulfed by a book or even reading.  I've always hated reading.  I highly suggest THE HUNGER GAMES to anyone looking for a GREAT read.<br />I didn't just want to leave a review but hopefully someone see's this.  I really want to say THANK YOU to Suzanne Collins.  I always loved movies because they were so quick, easy and simple.  I didn't have to think at all.  People have always told me that reading is, by far, better because you don't have someone telling you what to think.  I never understood that until this book.  I have NEVER been able to sit down, read a book and be able to visualize the story while I read.  NEVER!!!  Again, thank you very much Suzanne.<br />The minute I finish writing this review, I'm buying the other two books.<br /><br />Also, this is my first review.  This is one that I truly felt was review worthy.

B0071T5PN0|2.0|Musicians of this stature should not rest on their laurels. This is nothing more than a rehash of their 80's style.  If you are into nostalgia by all means pick this one up.  If you are looking for a more mature rock album from a band that could easily deliver it, this is not for you.  Perhaps that is why it is selling for a $2.99 download.

For those complaining that it doesn't move fast enough, there are two more books coming. This is classic Martin storytelling. I found it a great read!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album and Adele remind me so much of Amy Winehouse. Very soulful, both from London, and have seen and delt with alot of pain when it comes to love. From the first track, the now classic ''Rolling In The Deep'' I was hooked. Every song is well written and personal. This is one of the most heart breaking albums I have ever heard and one of the best soul albums every made. Songs like ''Turning Tables'', ''Set Fire To Rain'', ''One and Only'', and the smash ''Someone Like You'', are songs we will be playing for years to come. This is an album that truly deserves 5 stars and nothing less

B006OAB3ME|2.0|First, I love Paul, but this just isn't his style of music.  Not sure if he decided based on his singing on the Tony Bennett album or he wanted to take some of the cash Rod Stewart has been making off his great American songbook albums.  Paul just doesn't have the chops to pull of most of these old standards.  I mean, come on, Paul singing Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive???  About the best song on the album is the original My Valentine.  At least this sounds like a song Paul would sing.<br /><br />I know the Paul \\"fanboys\\" will like anything he puts out, but for me, this was a total mess.  This CD will probably never be played again. I would rather remember Paul the way he was.

The band seems to have progressed technically since their last release.<br /><br />My only complain is that the album does not seem to flow well at several points, which can be rather jarring.  However, this should not be enough to dissuade you from listening.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|***Update -  The new kindle fires now come with a calendar however I still use this app. It is feature rich and much easier to use. Worth every penny****<br /><br />I was surprised the kindle fire didn't come with at least a basic calendar, but this really fit the bill.  I was already using google calendar for our family, this imported beautifully, and is functional immediately.  I was also happily surprised how easy it was to enter knew info into the calendar from the fire.  I now have a portable day planner in my kindle fire.  I would have liked to see a list function, as I am a huge list fan, but over all I am 100% happy with my purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|when i first saw the book i ignored it then a couple months after i saw the movie commerical i rushd to get it it only took me 2 hrs to read and im only 12 yrs old i have to say this is so far my favourite book of all time. now im just waiting for the movie to come out
B002MQYOFW|3.0|All in all, I really enjoyed this book, up until the last few chapters which were very vacant.<br /><br />The climax at the end, was not very climatic, and the last chapter, instead of a cliffhanger, really just fell flat, as if the author ran out of steam or didn't want to detract from the next book. Although the attempt was there to end the first book for transition to the second, it was presented in a more 'matter of fact' fashion, than something that grips you.<br /><br />I thought at one point, that the last few chapters were actually written by a different person.<br /><br />As for the rest of the book, it was very easy to read, like a teen novel and lacked a lot of flourish.<br /><br />The premise of the whole 'hunger games' was really glanced over, and although it was understood, it was written as a broad concept rather than really getting into it.<br /><br />This is a kids book.. It was a good read, and is what it is...
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have installed on my Home Computer an Asus Xonar DG sound card. The card has a 32 Ohm 64 Ohm Exciter. While listening to my Sony MDR V6 Headphones, All EQ settings Flat, DFX 9 Free for MediaMonkey settings at 2, the Volume and Bass were more than sufficient. With my AKG K 240 MK II headphones there just was not enough there at those settings to get them going. Hooked up the FiiO E5, adjusted its volume to MAX and turned on the Bass Boost, Bam, what a difference. I highly recommend the FiiO E5. I turned up the volume all the way on the sound card and MediaMonkey, no music playing, I did not detect any hissing from the FiiO E5 at all. Some reported they have but I did not hear it.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a really nuanced look at the full spectrum of personality. I really appreciate that in celebrating the unique traits of introverts, Cain does not diminish or disparage those of extroverts. I think the book is a wonderful read for anyone because whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, these pages will illuminate the psychology and behavior of so many people in your life.

0439023491|3.0|Alright, this one was intense, but on a different level and for completely different reasons.. I was completely thrown once again, into Katniss's world and enthralled with everything.. (I need to say this.. I. HATE. PRESIDENT. SNOW.) All up until the Games. The last act of true surprise and horror for me, was what Katniss witnessed right before the Quell Games began. *TEARS*<br /><br />But it became boring to me after that. It lost its luster in getting me to want to find out what the heck is going on with this so called brief alliance with Finnick and the others. Hence my 3 star rating.<br /><br />I found myself, countless times, wanting to just reach the end of the book cos I knew that I was close. And I have to ask, why is there even a \\"love triangle\\" here? It doesnt work at all. Granted I've always been team Peeta, still am. Did I mention I love him even more in this book?<br /><br />But Gale, to me, will always just suit Katniss better as a friend. I found myself not feeling anything in their more \\"tender\\" moments in this book. And Gale for the most part in book one and this one, is not present that often to even stir up any kind of indecision on Katniss's part on who she should be with. In my opinion. I often get the impression that because Gale is so familiar to Katniss and deep down she knows where Gale's feelings lie with her, that this is the only reason why she is reluctant to act upon what she feels for Peeta. Not because she is unsure about the type of love she herself feels for Gale, but because of what she ultimately feels for Peeta. And lets just face it, fear in their type of situations, will make any person hesitate. We're literally talking life and death here.<br /><br />But I guess if you consider things from Katniss's POV & understand how basically her whole life she has been forced to accept that certain things may not happen for her, that she herself thinks that she doesnt even want them to happen. I can totally understand why if given the tip of a promise to such things, one would be a little gun shy.<br /><br />The cliff hanger... Not really a cliff hanger to me.<br />I would say if you are like me and are just as invested in this series, read this book. Its not a bad read at all, it just doesnt compare to the first. And this doesn't make it bad, just different. But I still highly recommend you read this series. Start to finish.<br /><br />I'm on to the final book.of a promise to such things, one would be a little gun shy.<br /><br />The cliff hanger...

1849514003|5.0|This is a great book to start on for Cocos2D game making. The broad range of recipes in the book are well written and have many re-usable functions you can play around with in your own code (cut and paste - the programmers friend). If you are just beginning with Cocos2D, it gives you a great set of building blocks to play with straight away.<br /><br />Although things start with simple 2D graphic manipulations, it quickly moves on to more advanced topics, touching on 3D in game, using Box2D for physics including for vehicles and ropes (which are tricky to do nicely), pathfinding from top down grids to side scrollers, in game scripting with Lua and all things audio (including voice recognition! Although that's using the OpenEars library). It even has space to fit in good coverage of the more mundane things you need to make a complete game - UI elements, game and menu states and dealing with data files.<br /><br />It covers a lot, but one of the nice things about the information being presented as recipes is that you can quickly narrow down what recipes to look at for solve any programming problems you have or answering questions.<br /><br />The code is aimed at Cocos2D of course, but many of the recipes can be used in other environments. The AI, path finding and scripting recipes can easily be re-used with other frameworks, as can most of the data recipes.<br /><br />On word of warning - this book won't teach you a lot about using Xcode or how to use Objective-C - it expects a basic degree of familiarity with both. If you are completely new to iOS development, you may want to buy another book along with this one to teach you about general iOS topics.<br /><br />This book is aimed squarely at solving problems you run into creating your game, and it does that very thoroughly.
0545425115|5.0|This book is amazing. I can't say anything in my review that hasn't been said in the thousands of reviews ahead of me.<br /><br />That being said, avoid the movie tie-in edition like the plague.<br /><br />Why? Well, there is no difference in the text. The cover is a glossy, ugly unattractive thing, while the original matte cover is classy and beautifully understated. The paper inside is slightly better but the cons outweigh this single pro.<br /><br />The main reason, however, is the price. The original is significantly cheaper, with a list of 8.99 and a sale price (currently) of 5.64. You won't know this though, if you search for the book. The movie tie-in is the only one that shows up in searches. The original is still available and should be ordered instead. (ISBN: 9780439023528)<br /><br />Shame on Amazon and Scholastic for this price gouge.

B005K15SPG|5.0|This is a great CD. Not the usual boring love songs, or angst-filled hate songs. Their music feels jubilant and celebratory, like you can picture yourself in a sea of people shoulder to shoulder in some underground pub in London, with a mug of beer in your fist, and everyone is singing Mumford songs at the top of their lungs word for word! That's what their music feels like to me.

On the other hand, if you are looking for a book to challenge your beliefs, change your ideas of how business can work, and inspire you to start something that matters, Blake Mycoskie has written your guide.<br /><br />This book is compiled of short stories about TOMS Shoes, as well as other do-good companies, and how they have been successful operating to the beat of a different drummer.  The back story and the personal tales are entertaining; the honesty and sincerity are inspiring; and the wisdom gained from experience is beneficial.<br /><br />Enjoy the read.<br /><br />Carpe diem.
B0067LXQAW|3.0|Okay musically this is the best Cranberries albums since No Need to Argue so what's missing?  The lyrics the lyrics the lyrics!!! The sentiment is the same: love songs, songs of betrayal, songs of healing but the problem is these are some of the laziest lyrics you will find in rock today.  Seriously!!  It's as if they've been written by a five-year-old!<br /><br />Here's an example...<br /><br />but it's raining in my heart<br />every time we are apart<br />and the sun won't shine today<br />so I had to walk away<br />if I could fly<br />you know that I try<br /><br />blah blah blah....<br />The reason why this is so annoying is because of how brilliant these musicians really are! Dolores as a songwriter is incredible but this is playing to the lowest common denominator.  Its as if they are desperate to please everybody.  The old cranberries took risks.  I don't mind a softer sound as long as there is some fire in it and not the kind that you will find in \\"Fire and Soul\\"<br /><br />Admittedly I bought this on a drunken night when I probably should have known better, but I am a 90s sentimentalist, so sue me!!  I do not agree with those who say that this is a terrible band, in fact some have told me this is one of the worst bands of all time.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  I think these are some of the best arrangements they've ever produced as a band the songs are not as annoyingly repetitive as some of their other stuff.  They have matured and it looks good on them. I would recommend this album if you were a fan of no need to argue.  Be warned though, you must be willing to overlook some stinky lyrics and let yourself fall into the lush world the lush cranberries have created.<br />Romanticism in music can be a beautiful thing but it requires care and complexity so it doesn't sound shlocky and banal.

B004CFBMRY|2.0|Just awful. Chapter after chapter of tall tales about improbable characters and some lost Mexican tribe that read exactly like \\"How to Live like a King's Kid\\", or that Carlos Casteneda tripe. Maybe there's something practical in there about running, but I just gave up after a third of the way through.<br /><br />Go watch \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\". Even that is not as bad as this.<br /><br />Rubbish. Two stars, because I've read worse.
B005HBP75K|4.0|I could see how one would be frustrated with how the story seems slow, or contrite and predictable but I'm really excited/hooked in to how about how the story is developing.  While Jesse's little trip was suspenseful, the point of the episode was to see if Jesse could be prevented from killing himself and Walt throwing Hank a bone, so to speak.<br /><br />And Gus, well man, Gus may the be genius because he is simply doing what he does best, getting business done.
B001AP11L6|2.0|I bought this album for the song Ball & Biscuit.  Was glad Seven Nation Army was on it.  Other than that - not really crazy about it, but it was a good price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoyed myself with this variety of different games. my husband and I sat here fir hours passing my kindle back and forth. it was free and fantastic.
B005URRCUY|1.0|Was extremely excited to get this album and only liked the popular song - Lonely Boys on it.  Disappointed, but the price was good.  Most of the songs sounded very similar to the last one heard.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|This is one terrific DVD!  Watching Sting and his band members collaborate on the different arrangements that make up the \\"Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" CD is a joy to watch.  The concert footage, his first post-Police, is great.  Genuine and just plain fun.  5 stars!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read this series individually and consider it to be among my all-time favorites. In fact I believe it will go down as one of my top-ten reads. Well written with complete plots and great character development, I recommend this to anyone who likes to escape to an alternate reality.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have tried many notebook/note pad apps and by far this is the best one. it is great for school use, which is what I use it for. but I would really recommend this for note taking, work or school. LOVE IT!
B002VX3RCW|3.0|I wanted to like this toy, but it's a little disappointing, and my 6 mo old agrees.  It's big and squishy, but the only squeaker is in the knight, and it's really quiet and hard to squeak.  The head has a big hard spot that makes a jingle when you shake it, the body just krinkles like the feet.  There's not enough variety in this toy to be stimulating.  It needs a big squeaker like in Jacque the Peacock.  My baby LOVES that one, which has all that this toy has, and more: Contrast patterns on the back, with bright colors on the front, A good face with big eyes (The horse's eyes are one on each side), a good squeaker, and layers of reinforced krinkle for good chomping.
B002BWP49M|2.0|The art director in this film deserves some love for creating some very cool houses.  The house owned by Dr. Carlisle and his vampire brood is to die for.  Also when Edward and Belle go to an island off the coast of Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon, their rented beach house is terribly romantic.  But who knew that when vampires make love they destroy their bedrooms.  This must get expensive if you have any sort of love life.<br /><br />Anyway, after much angst, Edward and Belle do get married but while on their honeymoon, she gets pregnant.  This is evidently a big surprise to all concerned.  A little research would have suggested it was possible so maybe some vamp size condoms would have been appropriate.  We also learn that vampire/human babies grow very rapidly and very aggressively.  After a short gestation period, Belle appears to be doomed if she goes ahead delivering the baby she definitely wants.  She can't be talked out of it.<br /><br />Jacob enters the picture again as the uncomfortable 3rd wheel, refusing to go away even after Belle is married and preggers.  Most of the movie is the usual moody, sullen, gloomy looks given to each other.  I've seen better acting on those Mexican soap operas.  I was hoping at least for the spawn to be some horrendous monster configuration but nope, she is the most adorable baby you've ever seen...and seems to have made an imprint on the jilted Jacob.  Now that sounds interesting.  Will Belle live?  I don't know, but I do know the final chapter of the series is due in the fall of 2012.<br /><br />The version of this movie I had was a Blu ray but for whatever reason only had the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.  Other versions should include a DTS HD Master Audio 7.1.  The picture is excellent and is presented in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.
B006G2ZEV6|3.0|I really like this game. It looks great, plays great, and sounds great. The twist on tower defense is excellent. This would be a 5 star review except that it freezes up after a few missions, and always on squad assault. Too bad because that part of the game looks great, like fire fight mode. Samsung epic 4g.
B00000DCH9|4.0|Billy Joel put out a lot of music after this album. Most of it faux rock drivel. This is the only decent album he ever made. But at least he hit one home run in his life. After he became a \\"star\\" he truly sucked.
1416585710|1.0|This is a long boooooring, boooolish, bad gunky , waste of time read.  I just read 11/22/63 and it was fantastic.  This book is not. A friend and I are reading this simultaneously and we both find it horrible and a challenge to finish.  I'm giving up after 450 pages because the story is lame and I don't care about the characters.  I didn't waste a dime on this book and I'm happy about that.  Very Bad and booooolish,  babyluv Stephen King!

B001P5HI4A|4.0|This was a good movie back in the day, and it still is. Watched it with my 20 year old daughter.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What can I say?  The final book of the Hunger Games series was brutal, sad, heart wrenching and satisfying.  I love that the characters are fleshed out to the fullest in this book.  You think that you know them pretty well in the first two books but then discover that these characters are truly three-dimensional.  They make you love them, hate them, and pity them.<br /><br />It was a satisfying series.  Once you get toward the end of the book, you start to realize that your journey with these beloved characters is ending.  The ending was really humble and satisfying in my opinion.  After you put the book down and think about it for a minute, you'll realize that the only way it could end was the way the author wrote it. :)
B006P4HFH6|4.0|The theme for this series is addicting but unfortunately unoriginal.  It plays upon people's same-old same-old fears without really provoking anything new or original.  Yes I will admit I lost sleep watching this series, I can clearly point out the unoriginal ties to the old \\"sex sells\\", \\"rosemary's baby\\", frankenstein, psychos, walking dead, living ghosts, GORE that has been filling our horror movie screens for years and years.  Although this series has some good acting and is engaging, it still lacks that ORIGINALITY which is why I couldn't rate it any higher than I did.  That and paying $2 an episode sucks cuz I'm a cheapskate I guess.  Gotta give it up for Jessica Lange; she can really freaking act! So I admit, I do want to see season 2 but I am really hoping it won't be quite as random or quick moving as this last episode of season 1.

1451648537|5.0|Loved this book! It was a Christmas present from my parents and I figured I might as well give it a shot. However, I had no idea that I would get so sucked in to this great biography. I'm not usually a fan of biographies in general, and especially not of current day people who I already hear enough about in the news. This was definitely an exception. I found myself glued to this book, reading it as if it were fiction. I think that this book also does a great job of showing the whole person Steve Jobs was, not just his good parts. In fact, there are a lot of places in the book that I was shocked to read, not having heard before of Steve's mean streak. But even still, with this mean streak, I was still enamored with him. I also enjoyed getting to know more about the tech industry in general. I've owned Apple products by whole life and was thrilled to get an insight into how they came about. Would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
0375842381|5.0|I read only a bit of book one of Harry Potter until a few years ago, before the last two films came out, when my daughter said the 5th book was amazing. I picked it up and devoured it, then read H.P. books# 6,#7,within a week as they were so good, then I read books #4,#3,#2,in that order, with great pleasure, but I still cannot get into book #1. However, I missed JKR's books so much that I felt a void had to be filled! Then I remembered the film, The Golden Compass, and my daughter also told me The Subtle Knife by Phillip Pullman was amazing, so I read it cover to cover in a couple days, and promptly devoured The Amber Spyglass and found them to be fascinating books, with scientific and philosophical ideas, fast-paced plots, intriguing characters, and beautiful writing. I then read The Sally Lockhart Series,also by Pullman,in chronological order for the young heroine,Sally, which began with the Ruby in the Smoke. This is a sort of Nancy Drew story, but MUCH better, and the following books get better and better! The last one I read called The Tin Princess I thought would be silly, because it featured a silly character from the previous novels as the book's heroine. I was pleasantly surprised as this young person rose to the occasion time after time and developed into a truly admirable character. The Sally Lockhart series is less intellectual, but lots of fun to read. The price of these paper back books is worth it on Amazon just to get a close look at the beautiful front covers, too.  If you miss Rowling's beautiful writing style, Pullman's books will fill the void! By the way, I have heard criticisms from very religious people that his writing is offensively iconoclastic, and I would say this is not true! His ideas are well thought out,subtle, provoking,brilliant and would not be not offensive to anyone, even a member of a strong religious group who would, for example, admire Thomas Aquinas. They are a joy to read and ponder! I hope they make a movie of the Subtle Knife soon. And when I re-watched The Golden Compass film, I saw even MORE there than when I first saw it a few years ago. I would NOW rank this film up with the original Narnia,which was A+ in my mind.  I have mentioned this to some friends who agree after watching The Golden Compass a second time they would rate it much higher and are hoping for the Subtle knife to be a movie also.<br /><br />So buy this set of books for fun and pleasure if you like adventure,fantasy,science fiction, strong characters, discussions of good and evil and all the shades of grey! I am a doctor by trade and right now I am too busy doing medical charts to edit this much,(sorry!) but I wanted to get this review out to anyone who craves this type of enjoyment!
0307949486|5.0|I must have read the first 30 pages of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo at least five times before I finally forced myself to at least get to page 100. And I'm so glad I did! Don't let this slow start scare you away, this book was an incredible read. I was surprised that at how much I came to love not just the story, but the characters as well. This book will definitely keep you up late reading!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Great kn my kindle fire.  App has great colors and is a great way to relax the mind.  My kids love it too.  5+ stars for sure.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|If you've made it this far, the hard work is done. You've reached the end of the rainbow and the pot of gold is within reach.<br /><br />If you have any interest at all in classical music or film scores, buy this! I predict it will quickly become one of your most-listened-to selections. If you haven't read already in someone else's review, Two Steps From Hell is not a grunge band, they make music for film trailers. If you're curious about which trailers these tracks have appeared in, head over to their Web site. These guys are serious, and they're amazingly good at what they do.<br /><br />Oh, and when you're done buying this, buy the companion album Archangel. It's just as good, which in itself is an amazing accomplishment (like lightning striking twice). If Amazon had six stars available, both albums would merit six stars. They're that good.<br /><br />For context, I have about 80 film scores in my collection.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very good graphics. This is a fun game. No issues so far :) Would recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is soo fun its very addicting! I spend hours playing this game, I cant put it down! this is one of my favorite games. I love the variety.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite albums of all time. It is so inspiring and sends a great message to the listeners. I also love the superhero aspects of the album. I have always been into comic books and superheroes and I can't wait for the Killjoy comic to come out! I would really, really recommend buying this CD. The lyrics and music are both phenomenal, My Chemical Romance has really outdone themselves.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Read this book for book club. It was a great read. This book left me wanting more. It was great to read the struggle between being a parent and spouse.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I knew given the low price that I wouldn't be getting a stylish or fancy case, but it certainly gets the job done. The case itself feels solid, doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone, and provides easy access to the ports and the buttons. I do feel that the circular pattern on the back is unnecessary and I wish it was perfectly clear, but a good case for less than $10 is ridiculously hard to come by. If you want a cheap, basic case look no further. If you want a rigid case with more bells and whistles, then look elsewhere.<br /><br />5 stars given the price, but if it were $15+ I would give it 4.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|This record has received very mixed reviews from the people I've shown this record to. Many people love the music, while others can't stand it. I'll admit that it isn't the most accessible album. I'm of the group that loves this record, and most of Bon Iver's other work. I find it excellent working music, or music to just sit down and listen to. I bought the 12\\" LP, which shipped in excellent condition from Amazon. I did find the packaging to be a little underwhelming -- the inner sleeve being merely a paper envelope -- but nothing to detract a star from this review. The record does come with a code to download a copy of the album in MP3 format, though I wish it gave the option for a FLAC download. Again, nothing major, and I'm reviewing the music, not the shipping conditions. Overall, a great record, but it may not be for you.
0307719774|5.0|My friend really likes this book.  You get to answer a question each day and then look back at your answers over the course of 5 years.  He likes reflecting on things like this and it made a great gift for him!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game it takes a while to play all the games tho. It has some games that are really fun to.
1427646341|5.0|Too often Jane Austen comes across as unapproachable and dry. This version is exactly the opposite: accessible and enthralling. As someone who does not consider themselves an Austen man, this audio book might cause me to change my tune. Can't wait to see what else this reader has done!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|It was actually quite enjoyable reading the book after the seeing the movie because I caught a lot of things along the way I perhaps wouldn't have otherwise.  I thought it was going to be a waste of time since I knew how it ends, but I was wrong.  Generally, there's nothing worse for me than reading a mystery when you know the ending.  However, even after being familiar with the story, it was still a page turner because it is so well written.  If you're ambivalent about reading this because you saw the movie, don't be.  Go for it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Enjoyed this one a lot. Just keep your eyes on the trees. Also make sure you check out the store for some cool new treads.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I just saw this in movie theaters. I am certainly going to buy it! The story is so full of emotion, the sets are phenomenal, and the songs are great. This show is a sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, and some themes from The Phantom carried over to this show. A lot of new elements have been added to the plot. For instance, Christine is marrried to Raoul and their marriage is troubled. They have a son. And the Girys become \\"frenemies\\" of the family de Chagny.<br /><br />I feel the need to add:  The original show that was in London was reviewed badly, but this is an entirely different production. I would recommend watching the trailer for this on YouTube. It gives you a good idea of what to expect with the musical's sets, choreography, and one of the songs.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|This album and film are so multi-faceted that even after over 20 years of listening and watching, I garner something new each time. My18 year old son said he didn't like old music, then I played Floyd for him, it sure opened his eyes!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really have gotten addicted to this game.  It is great, fast and fun.  Ads are only in beginning and are no problem. Got for free but would have paid!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun game. Needs more obvious options screen. Perhaps additional upgrade options would be fun, too. Flying squirrels are hilarious. I'm still not very good at this game.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|This movie was very well written. Plus, the actors were great!! I was into the movie the whole time!!! I never thought that metal robots could be soo entertaining!! I was rooting for Atom in the end!! At least he got the People's Choice Award!! Yay for the kid that played in the movie as well!! I would definitely recommend this movie; and I would see it again!!!
B002G1K82Q|4.0|A clever weave of the subject matter of the Beatle's songs into a story that is entertaining. Really liked the character's names and the \\"easter eggs\\" placed subtly throughout the movie.
1451627289|1.0|I hesitate to write this in view of Stephen King's reputation and popularity.  But having just finished this 848-page tome I am let down and disapopointed.  Mr. King labored for two years and amassed very much research to bring forth a novelistic mouse.  The whole wormhole concept as he described it was just plain fanciful although, as usual, he evoked old Maine and New England with his usual luscious attentivity to nostalgic detail.  Re the wormhole fantasy, that's OK, storywriter's license.  But to then get bogged down and more bogged down in minutiae about the Oswalds in the leadup to the assassination was a waste of time.  Further, I had hoped to find in King's imagination some sort of plausible reconstruct of what the world might have been like after his character succeeded and the assasination had been averted.  But no, just a few unpersuasive dystopian pages in Chapters 30 and 31.  That said, I did find the love story between King's protagonist and his beloved Sadie somewhat appealing and persuasively romantic.  But THAT said, the ultimate end of the novel was a real downer.  To preserve Sadies's life who otherwise died in preventing Oswald's attempt, King's protaganist goes back in time one last time to save her, he ignores Oswald, and Kennedy dies.  Bummer.<br />P.S.  I did much appreciate and applaud Mr. King for the grace note in his Afterward at the very end to give a bow to the unsung late Jack Finney, author of a novel called \\"Time and Again\\" and unacknowledged inspirer of the later Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour movie \\"Somewhere in Time\\" (see my reviews of each). That novel and that movie are musts for people intelligently interested in the theme of time-travel.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Downloaded this when it was free and haven't been able to stop playing it.  It's like Asteroids, and Space Invaders, and Galaga, but with a story.  Works GREAT on my Galaxy tab, and I love that you never really die.  The controls are pretty good but sometimes the thumb I'm not using to stear with will accidentally touch the screen and mess me up, but overall VERY good gameplay.  Only reason for loss of a star is some of the content in the banter between the hero and villian, I know it's nothing compared to what is in alot of games today, but call me old fashioned, something that looks this much like a &quot;kids&quot; game should a bit more appropriate.<br /><br />Overall, AWESOME GAME!!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|These are great books. I have been apprehensive about reading them for some time because I tend ti avoid the trends, but sometimes the trends are right. Sample them and if you are intrigued get them. I purchased the kindle trilogy edition and thoroughly enjoyed them. Despite the formatting complaints if others, I found that it in no way impeded my reading experience. Though there are formatting issues, I never noticed during the course of reading them. My only warning is to be sure you have time available to commit to readig these as you will not want to put them down. Enjoy!<br /><br />Amending:  I reviewed these books before I was completely finished with the trilogy.  The first two books are very good and pull you through quickly. I found the third book, disappointing to say the list.  Like some other readers, Katniss became too self concerned and bratty.  I guess all I can say is that the author provided a very shallow and disappointing ending to a very good set of books.
0061537934|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read.  It is written from the dogs perspective and it is at times humourous and at others very touching and poignant. I could not put it down and now am anxious to read the authors other books.
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]Great disappointment and over-priced  on Kindle.  It is a short story definitely should NOT be classified as a book.  As a short story I would give it 3.5 stars, however I expected a book.  Do not buy  this on Kindle unless you have money to burn; it is not worth the price; buy it in used paperback books. I read \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" in a couple of hours; it came to an end ~ I could not believe it.  The 'very short story' was OK unless you have extra money to spend, or want it on Kindle; please buy this in used paperback.  I will not buy another Dexter book - Jeff Lindsay, Author in Kindle.  I may later much later pay used paperback 'Dexter' book by Jeff Lindsay.<br />I truly hope you will read this and take it at face value ~~ it is a truthful evaluation.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Another great album from Tony Bennett with a stellar choice of co- singers. You can always count on him to do a good job.
1400069289|5.0|As I read this book I kept wondering, \\"Is this a self-help book? Or is it a book about behavioral science?\\" Because parts of the book are clearly defined, immediately applicable tips and tricks you can use to change bad habits. (And what I learned is that so many things ARE habits. Insomnia, for example, is a bad habit.)  But much of this book isn't news-you-can-use. It's just damn interesting. Like the chapter on how Target uses shopping data to identify its pregnant customers. (And why pregnant customers are worth millions.) And why a miracle chemical that gets the stink out of everything doesn't sell, until advertisers get women addicted to its spritz.<br /><br />Well worth the read.
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|At first I felt a little silly using this at my local gym, but once I found how dramatically it increases the intensity of my workout, I think anyone who doesn't use it is silly.  Imagine swimming without having to focus on your breathing at all, just your stroke.  That's what this gives you.  My only complaint is that I think it could be a tad longer or have a different angle, because I sometimes do get some backflow into it, especially in choppy water.  But overall, it's great, and I highly recommend it to lap swimmers who swim for fitness.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is great for all ages, whether you're just doodling or creating serious art. It has endless possibilities for creating anytime or anywhere you like. I'm 25 and I love to paint or color to relax when I'm stressed or just for the fun of creating and with this app you always have art supplies just a click away.The realistic quality of the paintbrush or colored pencils will definitely impress and the stamp,clip art/sticker features are an added bonus. Plus, you can easily save and share your creations. Its absolutely worth paying for, you wont regret it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I know this app looks kind of weird but this is something to see this app is so fun I'm addicted to it its really fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is one of those games where you say &quot;just one more game&quot;....oblver and over and over.  There is always some goal or incentive to keep playing...plus it's just plain fun!
0375869026|5.0|Character, Auggie has a deformed face - not his fault as he was born with the deformities.  He struggles to fit into Middle School and comfortable with friends, family and life.  He gets stared at no matter where he goes.  His best day of the year is Halloween so he can wear a mask and be like everyone else.  I haven't read the other reviews, but I thank author, Palacio, for writing this book to show that whether a young person or adult, we all have flaws.  People need to be more accepting of our limitations and look past the physical restrictions that we have as human beings.  I think this book should be read by all 5-6th graders for a true understanding of others.  I am a church librarian and have purchased this book for young readers (and adults) to see that we need to be compassionate to others - no matter what our facial features are.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great to find a new author & series that captures the attention!  I downloaded the first part of the series, started reading & couldn't stop until I finished it, then immediately downloaded the next four parts!  It took me two days to finish it all only because I had to go to work!!  I can't wait for part six to come out so I can jump back into this dystopian world full of unique characters & ideas.  Please keep writing Mr. Howey!  I am now following you on twitter!

1423101502|5.0|The last olympian by: Rick Rioradn was one of the best books i have ever raed and defently makes it into my top 10 books i've read, and i've read a lot of books.i think the best part in the book was when the hero finly  killed the evil koronrs. this part was one of the best becaus everyone celabreates and i also liked when annabeths mom \\"talked\\" with percy about his and annabeths relasonship. But for me there wasn't enough romace but demending on the person you might say that there was to much. But other than that the book was realy good!But if you ask me i think there should be another book talking about the next big propce.thank you!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book/series of books! I love apocalyptic & post-apocalyptic fiction, so after reading all the positive reviews and seeing the awesome price for the omnibus edition, I pounced right on this. I'm so glad I did.<br />The first story would be a masterpiece all by itself. It literally left me open-mouthed the brutal twists at the end. I thought it would be a hard act to follow, and it took me awhile to warm up to the new characters introduced in book 2. But once I got to know them, I never wanted to leave them.<br />I can't wait for the hinted-at stories of the other silos. I'll definitely be following this author wherever he leads.

B000JIHP88|4.0|I didn't even register for this--I registered for a mobile from Etsy that wasn't mechanized.  This was given to me by a friend who never used it with her son...free of charge!  Boy, am I glad.  My daughter doesn't use this to fall asleep in her crib--she is put to sleep in the quiet--but I use this to entertain her when I need to buy myself a few minutes.  She's been truly enjoying it since about 2 1/2 months and now she's developed to the point where she \\"talks\\" to it at 4 months.  I can leave her and I hear her shrieking with joy at the mobile.<br /><br />I wish I could say this put her to sleep but I guess it's too much stimulation for her because she gets very, very excited by it, even with the soothing music!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First off, I am in my late 30s, so I am not a teenager saying \\"OMG best book Evvvver!\\". With that, here is my .02:<br /><br />No, this is not top level lit, okay? The writing is simple, brutal and direct with the author not pulling any punches-which makes the series work. The dystopian world of Panem is well described and given a good amount of detail and history, so you get a good feel of how things arrived to where there are. The Characters, despite some of the negative reviews here, are well developed and conflicted as they are living in a highly controlled, suffering world that is harsh and unforgiving.<br /><br />The basic premise is that Panem is a post-United States North America that was broken into 13 districts and ruled by the Capitol. About 75 years before the start of the book, the districts revolted against the Capitol and lost the war, with district 13 being destroyed. Every year since that loss, 2 children-a male and female-age 12-18 is taken at random from every district and put in a fight to the death competition where there is one survior.<br /><br />From there, the story goes and does not let up. A very good page turner. I went through the book in less than one day's reading, as it goes that fast.<br /><br />Themes:<br />Despite the movie marketing's focus on the Romance/Love Triangle that does exist in the book, that covers maybe 5% of the material in the story. In fact, that romance is just a small plot device to bring up the main themes of the story, so don't worry if this series is Twlight-esque, because it is not.<br />Two of the biggest themes present are A.what happens when Government becomes overbearing and controlling and B. how the media can manipulate the masses to frame practically anything any way they want. It is obvious that Collins was a little influenced by Orwell, Rand and a bit of Greek Myth(The Hunger Games idea was based on Thesus and Minotaur) throw in. She touches on the ideas that Orwell brought up in 1984 and some of the self-determination ideas that Rand is famous for, and I have to say, she does it in a non-complicated fashion that a young reader can grasp.<br />The Media Manipulation theme is ever present throughout the story, and it mirrors today's media outlets that can frame almost anything in anyway. I don't really have to say much on this, as it will be very clear throughout the story as she is very \\"in your face\\" on this one.<br /><br />I will put one warning out to Parents: This whole series is very gritty and brutal. The Games part in book one is bloody and can get harsh here and there, while in books 2 and 3, there is a fair amount of violence and death. It is not there just to be violent IMHO, as the author is showing that things can, and will, turn nasty when survival is on the line, even if the person in question is not too thrilled with the idea of it all. It also is used to demostrate and hit home the theme of Government gone overboard using any means to get results, even if the method could be considered inhuman/unethical. I think in this respect, it could be a good discussion point and a good lesson on why, for example, the founders of the US limited government as much as possible. Another good discussion point would be the effects of all this conflict, as the author also shows the effect of PTSD in a very simple fashion on the main character.<br /><br />I think this series could be a great gateway to Dystopian classics like 1984, Farenheight 451 and Starship Troopers. I also believe that this series could also be a gateway to other Sci-Fi classics and really get younger readers to put down the Video Games, Cell Phone, etc and read a good book.
B001AFF25W|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read, and entertaining throughout. Although it is motivational, this is not one of those books that will 'change your life'. Its a read thats meant to remind you of the ills of procrastination, throws a few pointers in, and overall is meant to be funny. This book really isn't made to be taken seriously, just a fun, quick read to pass the time.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|If you like Dexter, then it's safe to say you'll be a fan of the fourth season. I couldn't stop watching once I started... And I may have shed a few tears throughout the season.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase!
006197806X|4.0|Before reading Pandemonium, I have been hearing lots of flack about how others didn't like the book and that the ending was horrible . This book proves to me all the more that not everyone is going to like the same things when it comes to books. Pandemonium centers the story around Lena and her life now that Alex is dead and she is learning to survive in the Wilds. the old Lena has died off  in order to survive the delirium that Alex caused within her.  It took me a little bit to fully get into the story because it's written in a Then and Now type setting. Then being when Lena first lived in the Wilds , to Now , the events that happened after Lena is strong again. In the Now Lena is surviving the loss of Alex her first love , the one who infected her with the Delirium . Nothing could prepare her for the idea that she might open her heart to another... that she might just infect someone else with the Delirium.  Julian becomes an unexpected interest in Lena , but Lena struggles with the thought of giving her heart to another, after all she lost her first love. In this book you get to see the growth in Lena all the more for now not only does she have to survive the Wilds without Alex , but now she has to survive the possibility of falling in love.  I will disagree to a point  with those that did not like the ending .  I myself have a love hate relationship with it purely cause its a cliff hanger and makes me upset that I have to wait so long for the next book.  The ending left me with that \\"Oh Crap\\" feeling and without a doubt book three will be in my greedy little hands the very moment if goes on sale. So thank you Lauren Oliver for writing such a fantastic book , I will go sit in the corner now and pout until book three magically appears.<br /><br />The is review is of my own opinion I was in no way compensated for it. The review can also be found on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Goodreads , and the FB page.<br /><br />Enjoy....

1451627289|1.0|I don't know what book the 5 star people read but then I suppose some people are easily entertained.  This has got to be one of the dullest things King has ever written.  It was well over 200 pages before anything happened. Reading this felt like the equivalent of getting a root canal.  I found myself wondering if he had to wake the characters in the story when he wanted to use them.  At the pace this one moved I could imagine them nodding off waiting for him to come up with something for them to do.  It wasn't until my wife made a comment about him writing for the movies that I realized that was exactly what was wrong with this pig.  Stephen King did not write this for his readers, he wrote it to be easily converted into a screenplay.  By the time he gets done describing the locations you could build an entire set right from the book.  The only thing missing is detailed measurements.  The plot is goofy to start with, lots of running around while not doing anything, One can almost hear the slow scary music building in the background. It need be car chases can be inserted nearly anywhere to wake up the audience, and almost everything the protagonist does is as well thought out as the actions of any character in a slasher movie.  Never turn on the lights at night, if the killer is in the house go upstairs where it's easier to be trapped, etc.  For example. On his trip back to rescue the janitor as a boy, despite all the warnings from the other guy about the hazards and mistakes he made.  Our hero doesn't do one damn bit of research before hitting the trail.  He waits for the final moment before acting because all he knows is the essay paper.  For all his cries of how much that essay affected him, not once in the intervening years between the writing of that paper and the trip through time, does he fire up his internet connection to find out more about his friend.  He cares so much he doesn't lift a finger to investigate or even talk to the man.  Additionally, his repeated reference to Chaos Theory via the so called Butterfly effect is enough to set the teeth on edge of anyone that knows that sort of math.  He needs to stop getting he science from Wikipedia alone.  I guess when you get to the point where your name alone guarantees the sale and publishing of your book real research just gets in the way of cranking it out.  I think you have to be either a \\"King can do no wrong\\" level fan or very forgiving to give this one more that 3 stars.  It just doesn't stand up to the critical eye or the quality of his past work.  I can hardly believe this is the same man that gave us The Stand, The Shining, Pet Sematary, and Salem's Lot.  As a potential film it is fine and will probably get made into one.  The only sad part of that is that it's not original, Denzel Washington already did this story in the movies.  Maybe it's time for Mr. King to consider retiring on his laurels before he destroys any more of his reputation as a writer.
0380820846|5.0|There is so much to love about this novel.  I already knew Penelope from the previous books but she was so much better than I expected.  She was the shy and quiet debutante and is now evolving into a dynamic woman.<br /><br />Colin is also more than meets the eye.  I loved how Penelope helped Colin to want and achieve more for himself.<br /><br />Theirs is a feel-good romance, you can't help but smile and cheer as the relationship progresses. It's also wonderful to finally have the Lady Whistledown mystery solved.

1594203334|5.0|I read this book and enjoyed it very much.  My husband and I currently do not have children, and we are the only ones out of all of our friends who do not.  We are surrounded by roughly 10 children from 4 sets of parents that are: picky eaters; scream whenever they are told \\"No\\"; throw fits where they yell, kick, hit ANYONE; cry and tattle-tale when playing together; the list of bad behavior goes on and on.  The book states things that for my husband and I seem to be completely self-explanatory and sane, yet when we say ANYTHING to our friends about how their four year old should be able to fall asleep on their own, or play by themselves, or not interrupt, or not kick rocks at other kids, or be able to sit through a meal, or say please and thank you we hear \\"You don't understand because you don't have kids!\\"  As am American there were things that I don't necessarily agree with, like not breastfeeding, and not giving adequate praise, but as far as the \\"Education\\" goes, that is something I think a LOT of American parents could stand to learn, or at least be open-minded about.  I know there are bratty French children, even the author admits this, but as American's we need to recognize that we DO have bratty kids here, and being open minded to a different way of teaching them might be a good idea.  As I said to my husband, \\"It's so nice to read a book that makes me feel like I'm not insane for thinking that children are little people who can control themselves and who should hear \\"No\\" because not everyone in their life is going to care about making them happy.\\"  I say this to my friends with kids and I get horrified expressions and \\"Well, wait until you have kids... then you'll see...\\"  When my husband and I have children, which will be in the near future, we plan on implementing MANY of the techniques in this book.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This book really surprised me.  To be honest I didn't know anything about it when I bought it for Kindle.  I was actually looking for information about Total War Shogun 2 when I came across it.  The into sounded interesting so I bought it and started reading it while on the metro going to work.  A couple chapters in, I realized how amazing this book was.<br /><br />It was at that point that I did some research and realized this book is rather long and was written in 1975 which surprised me.  Neither of these are bad things, but I didn't expect it.<br /><br />This is one of those books that its hard to find a good stopping point.  No matter where you are in the book you are looking forward to the next paragraph.  The characters are well developed and change throughout the book.  One of the things I think was done extremely well was the references to the many culture differences between Europe and Japan in this time period.  The historical accuracy of the book is close enough to get the idea of what was going in the time period, but is not meant to be a history book by any means.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in feudal Japan or just wants a good story.

1567184855|3.0|This is an interesting book for readers who are believers in reincarnation but it slides over some of the important questions and must be taken \\"with a grain of salt\\". It is a little difficult to separate the Doctors own viewpoint and attitude from that of the subjects. He pushes hard to get answers about specifics when it is clear that those responses often can't be expressed in English. The range of subjects that the doctor hypnotizes is limited to mostly residents of Southern California and of course they are people who originally sought him out and can afford to pay him for his services. They all seem to have had somewhat similiar experiences in the spirit world between lives.<br />One can't help but wonder about the deeper questions of good and evil and what happens to souls after death when their lives on earth have been cruel and disruptive. The author slides over such questions with some vague comment about them being taken somewhere else. If the whole object of reincarnation is to improve and gradually move to a higher level, why does there seem to be so little overall improvement here on earth? The subjects of the Doctors study come across as extremely self centered and it would be helpful if there were a wider range and the doctor himself were a little less pushy.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Great to revisit remakes of some of the choicest of the Beatles music.  Nice to know that new generations aren;t ready to abandon some fine music.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This film reminds me of some of the really good European style thrillers of the 70's: for example, classics like George C. Scott's \\"The Last Run\\", Nicholson's \\"The Passenger\\", and more recently \\"Ronin\\". It has a very realistic European feel, with Clooney really the only American actor on scene, captured especially well on location. The pace of the film is suspensful with Clooney underplaying every scene with terse minimalistic dialog. The co-actors are all very good, and Clooney is at his very best, playing out of his usual cynical and gregarious character. The cinematography, as some have noted, is outrageously good. Overall, an extremely entertaining film, with a unique feel.
0312370849|4.0|This book allowed you to feel a love that other books don't allow you to always feel.

Act's of heroism are portraid and the events are so real that you can feel yourself in the story and wouldn't believe it's fiction!

0525478817|5.0|I have read almost all of John Green's books. I have enjoyed them all, however this one I have fallen in love with. There are certain stories that touch us, not just while we're reading them, but touch us deep down in our very cores and undeniably change us forever. This is such a tale. Cancer has affected almost everyone in some way, we all know someone who is/has suffered from this. But cancer has reaped a particularly huge toll amongst my relatives and loved ones. I've been the primary care giver for them once they are put on hospice. If cancer were a person I would murder it in cold blood and never lose any sleep. That is how strongly I feel on the subject. So reading stories about cancer usually really bother me and upset me because they are all tragic but none have ever fully & truly encompassed what it really means to deal with Cancer, long term from all prespectives while making the characters with Cancer into real world heroes and victims to be pitied. Hazel & Augustus/Gus are real, they are visceral and tangible as any person I care to know. They are more real than some real people I've met. John Green is truly a master of his craft and like fine wine he will only get better as time goes on. DFTBA!<br />~Some Girl in Oklahoma
B005D9B26E|5.0|The original album sounds great here. Maybe the Japanese Polydor version sounds better, but I have never heard it and think this one sounds just fine. It was a treat to hear Pete's 2 CDs worth of \\"Quadrophenia\\" demos, and the hardcover book is wonderful. The book, however, split from the binding very easily, but I repaired it perfectly with a small dab of Gorilla Glue. The reproduction of the \\"5:15\\" single is another treat, although I haven't got a turntable anymore. The 5th disc in the set is a slight let down. It's a 5.1 surround mix of a small handfull of the songs. I, like many others ask, why not the whole album in 5.1?
0470901071|3.0|Todd has a very good book to help you pass the CCNA exam, however:<br />1. He has this irritating habit of writing like he is talking to you<br />2. He will use a word e.g. discontiguous networks\\" and wait to define the word/explain what it means three chapters later. This is not helpful at all, and you will spend as much time on google defining words as you will reading the book<br />If you are ok with these things then, this is a very good book coz the material is explained pretty well for the most part, and at the chapter there are test/labs that help all the material you have done sink in.
1619492911|4.0|F. Scott Fitzgerald will forever be known for his immortal staple in the curriculum's of so many high schools across America and abroad -- The Great Gatsby. But for those readers who really want an insight into the life and style of the writer, I would certainly recommend this book. I found this more pleasurable to read than even This Side of Paradise. I also find it would be foolish to claim The Beautiful and Damned wasn't a premonition of what Fitzgerald saw in his personal relationship with his wife Zelda. Alas, Anthony and Gloria possess the same hedonistic materialism that he found in themselves. Regardless of how or why he created this work, I'm extremely glad he did. Fitzgerald is a writer that I enjoy introducing to others, and I'm pleased that most people are willing to know him as more than just the \\"guy who wrote Gatsby\\".<br /><br />Good reading to all!

B006OV7RQ4|4.0|Martha, the star of the movie, is a lost soul.  Gets into a cult, which are abusive by nature and can't handle the communal arrangements. She, called Marcy May in the cult, like most everyone wants something of her own but the leader spreads himself around.  But again, she was lost long before she got there. It is those kind aimless people, I guess, that join these cults. They find leaders that feed them emotional crumbs, something they have never found before. They never belonged to anything, don't care about much and don't know how to survive on their own. Then they get deep into the cult and the ugly stuff shows up - like murder.<br /><br />The Marcy's of the world cannot fit into normal society - they don't know the rules, simple things like not climbing on the kitchen table or wearing swimming suits. Unfortunately, not much means anything to them except some tiny little corner to crawl into for some comfort.  She will probably never be OK. With therapy, she might someday pretend to be normal most of the time. Something happened in her childhood to alienate her from normal behavior.<br /><br />Conclusion: the actress, Elizabeth Olsen, portrays the role of Martha Marcy May Marlene well.  It is a good production and the movie is cast well. It borders on not being entertaining while engrossing at the same time until the end when we realize nothing will change with our heroine. It is a dark story with little joy and even less hope, leaving a bleak taste of life. All said, this is the story the director wanted to tell and he did so successfully. It just wasn't a lot of fun and even less of everything for Martha.

B0028RXXE8|4.0|The series ROME is 22 hours in length.  It is jammed with history of that time.  The series contains a lot of battles, scheming for power, killing for power, seduction for power, and I believe a lack of the value of life which was prevalent in those times.  I believe the producers tried to maintain historical facts as well as including some fictional characters to help the story flow.  It is worth the time to watch.
B003OCFJ7U|5.0|This Arrow blu-ray of Dario Argento's Phenomena is excellent. I first watched Creepers (the US title for Phenomena) on the old Media Entertainment video. I remember enjoying it at a young age and the memories of the film always stuck with me.  The atmosphere in this movie is dream-like.  Jennifer Connelly gives an excellent performance as Jennifer Corvino.  I really liked Daria Nicolodi's performance as Ms. Bruckner, and I wish she had more screen time.  I recommend this film to everyone.  The combination of the night scenes, the Fohn wind in Switzerland, and that awesome theme music in beginning \\"Valley\\" makes this one unique movie you will not forget.  It is great to finally be able to watch it uncut.<br />The bluray picture quality is excellent. I have heard negative things about it, but when I put it in the blu-ray player I see a BEAUTIFUL image. This is the best transfer of the movie I have seen.  It doesn't have that gritty, fade, washed out look. The audio was excellent too.  I enjoyed the extras, such as the \\"making of\\" documentary. I just wish it came with the original theatrical trailer and some more extras from the time it was made in the 80s. The packaging was nice and I could tell much thought went into designing it.  Highly recommended.  I rate this 5 stars, excellent film plus excellent quality release!

0385344228|1.0|I suppose that this was a cleverly written book but the \\"surprise\\" ending is just depressing. I would only recommend this book to an insufferable optimist--and only to bring them down. Lame is the best single word to describe this book.

B0067LXQAW|5.0|On 'Roses', The Cranberries return to a melancholy mood with stringed instrumentals and lush arrangements.<br /><br />In 1993, The Cranberries debuted with a sound that incorporated an homage to The Smiths and 1980's guitars and percussion blended with Dolores O'Riordan's soft, airy vocals with just the right amount of angst.<br /><br />1994's follow-up, 'No Need To Argue' maintained the band's gentle arrangements while refining their rock edge with the hit song, \\"Zombie\\".  Throughout both of these first two albums, The Cranberries' sound was perfectly captured by producer Stephen Street (Blur, The Smiths).<br /><br />In 1996, for the band's third album, The Cranberries wanted to feature the \\"rawness\\" of their live shows by working with Aerosmith producer, Bruce Fairbairn.  The result saw Dolores O'Riordan forgoing her signature breathy vocals for powerhouse delivery while the songs, in general, were harder and arguably less cohesive.  Though 1996's \\"To The Faithful Departed\\" had its share of great songs (\\"Salvation\\", \\"Hollywood\\", \\"When You're Gone\\", \\"Free to Decide\\"), it lost the lush, melodic tone and layers of vocals and guitars that were so well-captured by 'Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?' (\\"Linger\\", \\"Dreams\\") and 'No Need to Argue' (\\"Ode To My Family\\", \\"I Can't Be With You\\").<br /><br />After a three-year hiatus, The Cranberries returned in 1999 with 'Bury The Hatchet', co-produced by Benedict Fenner and The Cranberries.  While 'Bury The Hatchet' attempted to blend The Cranberries \\"classic\\" sound with some of the styles used on 'To The Faithful Departed' (horns and brass instruments as well as stringed instruments), the quality of the songs were lackluster (compared to the band's previous efforts).<br /><br />Two years later, The Cranberries offered a follow-up album, 'Wake Up And Smell The Coffee', produced by Stephen Street and The Cranberries.  Though 'Wake Up And Smell The Coffee' contains a terrific collection of songs, the band had several obstacles during production that resulted in a less than perfect final result.  The primary problem was the dissolution of the band's record company and the severe lack of promotion for the album.  Additionally, behind the scenes, the band struggled with individual health and family challenges that led to much of the album's production being rushed or transferred from working demos with little studio work.<br /><br />After disappointing album sales in 2001, years of world tours and personal burnout, the band went on hiatus on 2003, leaving their 6th album unfinished.<br /><br />Finally, 11 years after 2001's 'Wake Up And Smell The Coffee', The Cranberries have returned with 'Roses', their sixth studio album.<br /><br />'Roses' was produced by Stephen Street, who took extreme care to \\"recapture The Cranberries' classic sound\\" (as defined by the band's debut album, 'Everybody Else...' and the sophomore album, 'No Need to Argue').<br /><br />First, Street helped O'Riordan return to an earthier, gentler approach to her vocal presentation.  After years of touring (and a personal appreciation for hard rock), Dolores's vocals had evolved towards a harder, tougher, bolder delivery.  For 'Roses', Street worked with Dolores to approach the vocals from a softer, breathier aspect - evoking a more introspective sound.<br /><br />Next, Street worked to incorporate stringed instruments as part of The Cranberries' layered sound.<br /><br />Over the years, guitarist and co-writer Noel Hogan has worked on solo projects to produce and record music, developing an interest and talent in programming.  For 'Roses', Hogan worked with Street to add a modern flair of production that the band considers to be more \\"experimental\\" for them.  The result is a well-unified collection of songs that reflect both Street's style with the band and Hogan's incorporation of cautious programming.<br /><br />'Roses' demonstrates bassist Mike Hogan's growth as a musician.  The bass lines are clear and compelling throughout the album as a whole.  Drummer Fergal Lawler continues to hold each song together with a drumming style that can be compared to 1980's bands like The Cure and Modern English.<br /><br />Though 'Roses' brings back layers of vocals, harmonies and pieces of background instrumentation, the album could have, perhaps, benefited from even more vocal and background layers.  The richness of sound is obvious on 'Roses', but is still noticeably less full when compared to the band's masterpiece, 'No Need to Argue'.<br /><br />The songs on 'Roses' are well-developed and enjoyable from start to finish.  The tone is mellow and dreamy.  Standout track \\"Conduct\\" opens the album and immediately signifies that \\"classic\\" sound for The Cranberries.  Perhaps \\"Conduct\\" works so well because the music was co-written by O'Riordan and Hogan.  The two have a special chemistry for developing songs that offer the ideal blend of melody and music.<br /><br />The introductory single, \\"Tomorrow\\", is one of the rarer upbeat songs on 'Roses'.  With an intro that immediately reminds listeners of 'No Need to Argue' b-side, \\"I Don't Need\\", \\"Tomorrow\\" is an up-tempo song that has helped to reintroduce audiences to the music of The Cranberries.  Merging the band's feel-good vibe from previous hits like \\"Dreams\\", \\"Tomorrow\\" has a nice place as the second track on the 'Roses' song collection.<br /><br />\\"Fire and Soul\\" is a nice example of the melding of contemporary drum programming and The Cranberries' traditional musicianship.  The vocal overlays are dominant on this track.  Though the melody may be a trifle boring, \\"Fire and Soul\\" helps to set the softer tone of the makes up the album's overall \\"chill\\" vibe.<br /><br />\\"Raining In My Heart\\" is a very Cranberries-esque track with the opening guitars (think \\"Animal Instinct\\" from 'Bury the Hatchet').  The accordion offers a European feel and also draws some similarities to the use of an accordion from the band's debut album's \\"Put Me Down\\".The song's guitars also conjure some similarities to 'Wake Up And Smell The Coffee' b-side, \\"Cape Town\\" while the song's thumping drum conclusion resembles 1993's \\"How\\".<br /><br />\\"Losing My Mind\\" is an interesting blend of Dolores's solo sound (2007's 'Are You Listening' and 2009's 'No Baggage) and The Cranberries' early work, particularly that of 'No Need To Argue'.  The song is a peaceful ride to a rockier chorus that quickly and suddenly reins back, spending little time on the rock edge of the song's chorus and more time on tranquility.  Dolores's vocal bends at the song's end are a strong reminder of The Cranberries' overall sound and Dolores's style as a vocalist.<br /><br />Picking up the pace and moving into a more adventurous subject matter, \\"Schizophrenic Playboys\\" is the \\"rock song\\" of 'Roses'.  This fun song has a James Bond vibe with an interesting combination of guitars and strings.<br /><br />After the rocking ride of \\"Schizophrenic Playboys\\", 'Roses' quickly returns to a slower pace with \\"Waiting In Walthamstow\\".  With it's somber strings and jazzy bass line, \\"Waiting In Walthamstow\\" has an appropriate London feel, while blending Dolores's vocal layers and The Cranberries' trademark guitars.  Towards the song's close, one can hear traces of 'No Need To Argue's \\"Everything I Said\\", while the song, as a whole, is probably the most unique song for The Cranberries on the 'Roses' album.<br /><br />\\"Show Me\\", penned exclusively by Dolores O'Riordan, is an inspiring song with a galloping rhythm reminiscent of \\"Dreams\\".  The powerful use of strings is the key to this song's success.<br /><br />\\"Astral Projections\\" was originally written in 2002 and was performed live throughout 2003.  Finally released on 'Roses', the song is an appropriate fit for the album's dreamy mood.  The guitars and dominant percussion make for a well-arranged song.  Similar to \\"Losing My Mind\\", \\"Astral Projections\\" takes you on a ride of stillness to more of a powerhouse chorus, while quickly returning to its subtler self.<br /><br />\\"So Good\\", also written exclusively by O'Riordan, is the closest song to those found within Dolores's solo work.  A bit repetitive and predictable, \\"So Good\\" is a weaker song for the 'Roses' ensemble, but still has its shining moments - particularly with the use of strings, almost reminding the listener of sounds from \\"Ode To My Family\\".<br /><br />Title track, \\"Roses\\", is a serene song, reflecting on the pain of life and life lost.  Inspired by the health problems experienced by Dolores's father (who passed away in November of 2011), \\"Roses\\" is a somber reminder of pain associated with the loss of a relationship.  Dolores sings each lyrics with a sadness.  The fuzz guitar solo brings out a moving aspect for the song and helps to keep interest in the song's gentle melody.<br /><br />Whether you are an established fan who is listening for that specific Cranberries \\"sound\\" or new to the band, 'Roses' is an incredible collection of quality music, performed by a band with a special sound and a unique chemistry as a musical unit.<br /><br />'Roses' is not a departure for The Cranberries, nor it is a repeat of their earlier hits.  It offers a nice blend of predictability and surprise.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|best version of mahjongg I've played. high quality graphics, lots of features. on the home screen it asks if youre interested in other games by same developer.  I'm using an asus  eee pad transformer prime. again, definitely my most used free app of the day.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great way to pass time and cure boredom. some of the games can be challenging! I would recommend this app.
B006LS7DQE|3.0|This is definitely a solid game... not as good as the original, but that isn't on Android so I'm willing to make do. What I absolutely don't think is acceptable is how this runs on the Kindle Fire. It is choppy from beginning to end, to the point of distraction. The hardware is more than capable of handling this, so I imagine there's sloppy coding to blame.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|I had the free version. It popped up a message that said I needed the paid version to play one of my videos. No dice, no video.
B000002KK2|5.0|I don't speak english but this album was and IS one of my best time machine to go where my mind, childhood and a lot of memories are, just listening Company, young blood, coolsville, after hours, etc...<br />and \\"Chuck e's..\\" we always thought she says \\"jackie's in love\\" my name, so what can I say, I listen other music of Rickie but any one of them catch me the way this one did, next discography is a little bit pretentious and cocaine complexity I'm not in. This one, YES, is commercial, simple maybe, simple to understand but put this record loud on a sunday morning and all the black clouds will go hell.<br />Thanks Rickie
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I love this game it took the best out of old school space games and put it together in one game the neon art looks really good and the game is very fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent app. Very efficient and easy to use. I take notes and use the reading plan. I highly recommend it.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I've been a Whitney Houston fan since 1985. I actually have this on record and cassette tape. But thought I buy it on cd since this was the only Whitney album I didn't have on cd. What can I say but this was another one of my  favorite idols who's gone too soon. So sad that all great artist like these are gone now. All we have is there music to remember them. R.I.P Ms. Houston!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|What a great Mahjong game!  The people complaining about ads are cracking me up.  There is one ad at the beginning that basically asks you to try one of their other games.  So what!?!?  You know you didn't pay for the game!  Even if you did...really?  There is one ad, quit complaining!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's great while I'm sitting in the parkinglot waiting<br />for the kids to get out of school.  my kids love it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great fun. Repetitive in order to get enough points to open new game, but that's the nature of this one.<br />Hey LD in charge of Mole Mania: you should be severely reprimanded for your points structure. Severely.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I chose this cover after reading other reviews on Amazon.  I was very pleased with the how the case locked into place in the and the protective nature of the outer hard shell.  I gave it 4 stars as the ability to use the cover to prop the device at an angle is less than sturdy.  It only works if it is on a flat surface.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend this to protect your Fire.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals. Mostly this is a pleasant book, with short bits in between that are slightly boring. I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting. But overall I think it is worth reading for its messages, plus it's free on the Kindle so I have no complaints.
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|W.E. was beyond what i expected. I totally did not expect it to be such masterpiece, it really blew me away. Everything about this film impressed me from the costume, the lighting, the cast, but most importantly the the accuracy of the story and how Madonna was able to show a different side of the story. As a fan of The British Monarchy i had read a lot about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor but i never bothered to see the Duchess's side of the story and just what she had to go through, what she had to give up. Everyone always thinks about what King Edward VIII gave up, but they never take in consideration the hell she went through and that is what W.E. did for me it made me think and see it from her point of view. Once again Madonna has impressed me with her work, and honestly i don't care what the media says she did a great job directing this film. I am very proud to be a fan of such an intelligent, intellectual, brilliant, and talented artist who never cease to amaze me.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|This is some of Frank Sinatra's finest music. He worked with many during his long career, but being paired with Antonio Carlos Jobim produced a sound that, in my opinion, will never be duplicated. Frank was at his absolute best in the 1960's, and this pairing with Jobim equals or even surpasses his work with Count Basie and Nelson Riddle. If anyone had any trepidations about Frank being paired with the master of the bossa nova, the first studio recordings settled that forever. I was quite pleased to see Desafinado and Bonita make it onto this CD. I think these two were two of Frank's best. I have been a long time fan of Sid Mark's \\"The Sounds of Sinatra\\" radio program in Philadelphia. Sid always seems to give the music Frank did with Antonio a special place in the program, and I believe it deserves to be. The mood; the sun and the beach in Rio de Janeiro mean one thing, Sinatra and Jobim. Some very fine music!
1400064287|5.0|I got the book today and no sooner had I completed reading the first page than I had the urge to write a review because I think it is going to be good. I may write another review after I am through reading but I have to say this. An example that was given about an urban legend stuck in my mind the moment I read the story and even before getting to the tools that can be used to make ideas stick, I already get the point.This is going to be a great book and I just had to share my thoughts even before completing it . look forward for a second review.......
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and competitive. my 3 year old plays these games too and loves it. its impossible to get bored playing these games
B0067Q42BY|5.0|So happy I didn't pay attention to all the complaining about the ads! Picked this up as FAOTD as I'm sure many of the people complaining did as well. Works great on my Fire. Ads for their other apps on the opening page, which is not a bother at all, just tap to play. I personally don't have a problem with the Devs. advertising their other apps on the game paid or not. Gives me a chance to see what they have to offer. I would have happily paid $4.99 for this app.<br />My only complaint is the sleep I miss due to lost track of time! Thanks G5, great game!
B005K2YZ5E|5.0|This is a great product.  The case is slim and easy to carry along, but still provides cushioning for the Kindle (I have the basic Kindle 4).  I also have the marware sport grip around my Kindle and both fit in the case.  It is a little snug, but worth it.  I have the gunmetal/white /robin and love the colors.  The picture is an accurate representation.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|Between us my wife and I have bought three different styles of protective cases for our Kindles. This is by far my favorite. It is a simple sleeve with velcro closure (very fast open and close) with enough padding to give good protection against drops. I find I greatly prefer having no case at all when actually reading. When done it takes two seconds to stash the Kindle in the case and close it securely and toss it in your backpack or purse or on the bedside table. It also has enough room for the charger cord. I find it much more convenient than the cases that stay attached even when you are using the device. Great product.
B005G6QF8Y|4.0|I too was turned onto this album when Amazon offered \\"Wonderland\\" for free. I found it intriguing & eventually bought the album. My first listen was marred by the awful sequencing. There are a couple of throwaway tracks (Broke and an awful remix of Mirrors) that do her no favors and it felt like the shining moments of the album are buried. If you really want to know what she's capable of, listen to Nothing Lasts Forever, If I Was God, Love Is A Suicide - the writing is solid, the vocals are excellent and the music ties it all together. She's destined to be compared to Lady Gaga but it sounds like she's going for Rhianna - if you like that sort of thing, Acid Annie, Break You Hard, Mirrors and Wonderland are all right up that alley, though the lyrics are more demanding. Why they added a will.i.am sample to Free I don't understand... it is by far the most irritating part of the album. The overly chipper broke shopaholic routine was old before it started, but his bits are just inane. Superficial grew on me after a few listens & while Mirrors tries too hard, it's fun to sing along with. Overall, one of the better \\"dance\\" albums I've heard.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|A solid solution for viewing and limited editing  documents on my phone. Very useful and straightforward. Keep up the good work.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|When I first approached the book, my reaction to was that it was very \\"stylized.\\"  However, as I read it, my reaction changed so that I saw it as \\"stylish.\\"  Everything about this novel is different. The characters are so well portrayed, with such authenticity, that I felt they were friends and neighbors.  The story, while taking place during a time period I don't enjoy reading about, is extraordinary in that it is largely told through the voice of Death -- who makes no judgments.  This book is so different and so rewarding that I rated it a 5 and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys modern literature.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Was 4-star until update.  After installing update on Kindle Fire, became very slow, then froze up and forced close.  Reinstalled twice.  Works ok at first, then same thing - slows down, freezes, then force closes.  Need a fix so I can access my email.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|My friend thinks I was crazy, just for the fact I have never EVER seen a musical. And yet I was willing to go see this in theaters. He tried to catch me up on what the Phantom is all about before it started. But I had a pretty good idea, based on the normal Hollywood movies. And I never was a true fan of musicals to be honest. But this... this was such pure art! I never been so drawn into a show like this, the lyrics to the songs, the singers themselves were just flawless, absolute perfection. The stage designs where beautiful and beyond creative. The ending kind of had me tearing up a bit, I can't wait for the rerun in the theater again. I will be seeing it again!<br />And if you haven't seen it, I would strongly recommend you going to see it.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|some enemies will fly into the ships horizontal path and fire horizontally, makeing it imposible to evade. this happens quite often.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very interesting game.  I played all the game three times. My seven years old son likes to play with me.<br />I am going to buy the second part too:-)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think that this app is fun. My bro and i think this app rocks. We always cant decide what apps to get.
1594744769|5.0|I am so thankful for other reader's reviews and it was recommended that this book not be purchased for the Kindle due to the pictures that accompany it. Heeding that advice was one of the smartest things ever. This is not a book I would have ever picked up on my own but after reading it I was sad that it was over. To me, this was like Harry Potter meets the circus meets Ripley's Believe it or Not. The characters were so unique and well defined that I felt I was a part of the story. The imagination of the author to come up with and beautifully tie together all the events of this book was amazing. Every part of this book made sense and fit together to make a wonderful literary experience. The pictures were what presented that Ripley's feeling and I was grateful that I chose a hard copy and had the pictures as reference. In the end of the book it outlines that all the pictures are original vintage photos and describes where they came from, which makes the book that much more magical.<br />This is a book I would have loved as a young child and it is an excellent read for a middle school boy or girl. There is a couple of \\"kissing scenes\\" but it is very innocent and age appropriate based on the main character. They are very brief and not descriptive so it doesn't interfere with the story nor does it change it into a romance story. I have recommended this book to several of my friends and will put it on the shelf until my youngest is old enough to read it.<br />I really enjoy books I can share with my children and it is a unique find to read a book that you can share with your friends and your children. Read this book, you won't be disappointed.
0312576463|5.0|It's been well over a year since I read this book; I think its the best Iv'e ever read. It was incredibly expansive(yet extremely intimate); like East of Eden by Steinbeck - one of those books I don't want to end. Gotta say I did not pay that much attention to the theme of Freedom; was I supposed too?. Franzen does an incredible job of getting inside the psyche of the American culture, at least many aspects of it, as well as the psyche of modern American, with a concentration on the the well educated urban liberal. Though Franzen may be one as well, as well as a good deal of those enjoying the book, what makes him great is his honesty in exposing their pretensions, absurdities and other shortcomings. For example, he does a major dressing down of the aging and arrogant radical baby boomer professors who have developed their own delusional hyper-liberal cocoon (I think it was in another book other than Freedom). I can so well identify with this; I lived in the warm-bath liberal cocoon of South Minneapolis, and loved it. Now in AZ (gotta get outta here) I have to do a much more rigorous job of reconciling different beliefs. Believe me, the liberal cocoon is more pleasant, but greater exposure does lead to a more rigorous examination of all beliefs and opnions.  His description of the gentrified St. Paul neighborhood at the beginning of the book was so spot on I assumed he was from the Twin Cities (he's from St. Louis).<br /><br />After Freedom, I immediately read \\"The Corrections\\" and \\"Strong Motion.\\"  I know The Corrections got great reviews, but I think it was a bit of a dig on the typical Midwest family; slightly too cool for school in its condescending tone. Also, a somewhat depressing tome, but yet having many great moments. \\"Freedom\\" was not like this - it seemed like he now has the confidence, maturity or freedom to set whatever tone he wants.<br /><br />Strong Motion moved slow at times toward the beginning, but also becomes an exciting read with some incredible writing in the latter parts of the book.<br /><br />Franzen has actually altered my notion of what a novel can be.
B005KELQEU|5.0|It is good material and it have the right size. It is all perfect. I am totally satisfied! On the minus side it was rather expensive. Please excuse my bad english.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolutely great Bible tool, love being able to use NIV and ESV, the plans to encourage you to read it daily are great too.
B0058VW36U|5.0|best game ever. wish I could give a 10 star instead. Om Nom is so cute. they should put om nom in an other game. also who could go wrong with eating candy. candy is delicious. yum. it works and looks awesome on my kindle fire.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This set is just as described, if you love the matrix you will love this set of blue rays. Great value as well.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Amazing and absolutely breathtaking.  Gave me goosebumps - so well filmed that you feel as if you were actually there live.
0446571415|2.0|I have read all of the Camel Club books and found this one to be very weak and difficult to keep reading.  There was no real suspense and it was very repetitive.  I love the series but found this one lacking.
0545265355|5.0|Have to say that I had \\"turned my nose up\\" at these books more than once this past year as I can be that way about \\"trends\\". I just finished them this week...quick and compelling reads interrupted only by trips to the store to get each book. These books almost made me want to be a middle or high school teacher so that I could teach them to young people. Great story about courage and heroism in the face of harrowing circumstances. I could think of all sorts of discussions to be gleaned from these stories from personal relationships to politics to how we depend on young people to fight our wars, etc. Bravo Ms. Collins - your Young Adult fiction holds many lessons for all ages!
0061914177|1.0|I can't believe this got published.  I also can't believe there are so many 5 star ratings.  He spends too much time telling you what he'll tell you later in the book, and bragging.  This is at best a bad blog post.  The meat of it includes describing facebook to the reader...  really?  Tim Ferris should be ashamed of himself for lending his name to this.  I will assume he never actually read it before he gave the cover quote.  That is the only explanation.
1857885082|4.0|Having read this book I have finally realised (after many years) that it is just possible that I (of all people) being English and living in the USA, seem ODD to Americans. Me??<br /><br />I am the only one thinking and behaving normally for goodness sake!<br /><br />When my coworker asks me how I am doing on a project and I give her a modest little smile, tell her that it is coming along slowly, and I basically ASSURE HER that it is nothing great, she should surely know that I have been putting my heart and soul into it and am secretly quite impressed with my efforts (and myself) and she should also surely know that it was really rather forward of her to ask such a question!<br /><br />But she doesn't know. I am shocked when she flashes me a quick look that seems for all the world to say \\"oh, poor Louise, never sure of herself, not very accomplished, defintely has her challenges!\\" The cheek of it!<br /><br />It is almost as disgruntling a situation as my other coworker who insists ON TALKING ABOUT HERSELF on a nearly daily basis, and generally behaving like she is being interviewed for a much coveted higher position. Not by her boss, oh no, but by her other coworkers, in the break room, in the office, in the meeting room, outside in the parking lot, in the loo and with whomever seems to be around (or outside the loo door) at the time, and with anyone who is talking about anything even vaguely work related at all. Heaven help us if we are in an actual meeting pertaining to work!  All those poor unfortunates stuck listening do not seem to be irked AT ALL by her sharing about the prior ten years experience she had at another company with a product new to the rest of us and her insider, advanced and superiour knowledge about the said product, or the fact that she was trained by a Dr. (HOW MANY TIMES have a I heard THAT one) or that she understands how and why a ph value determines the efficacy of the serum we are discussing (HEY, we ALL know THAT, but we don't all feelthe need TO BRAG ABOUT IT) . . .noooo, nobody is irked! On the contrary people seem to be IMPRESSED WITH HER!  Everyone seems to think she is very accomplished and intelligent. Not one other soul seems to find her bragging a social sin! The wonder of it all.<br /><br />My own daughter, who I have lived with for 15 years (her whole life) does not understand me. She admittedly has been raised by an American father, has American educators, all American friends, an American voice instructor (I HAVE become slightly Americanised it seems, strangely enough I find that I only feel a little bit uncomfy sharing the private and boastful info that she has a good voice and the EXTREMELY PRIVATE financial info that we spend money on singing lessons) and that basically I am the only English person she is exposed to on a day to day basis.<br /><br />When she asks me if she looks nice and I say (with no eye rolling, in a serious tone, the way humour SHOULD BE delivered, naturally) that no, something odd happened to her over night, she appears to have grown copious amounts of lip hair and is now as skinny as a twig . .. she GETS UPSET! Clearly (come on, she has a mirror) she is not as skinny as a twig and she only has a reasonable amount of lip hair. Nothing she can't remove with a little hot wax.<br /><br />How many times do I have to explain to her that I mean the exact opposite of what I am saying?  That when I am being incredibly rude I am OBVIOUSLY joking (cause come on, I am a nice person, I am her mum, she must know that) and that the more derogatory my comments the more I am thinking to myself that she looks like a supermodel (no, an angel) and how in the world did I have a hand in creating such a gorgeous creature??<br /><br />I'm going to give her this book to read.  But it is long winded and the author decidedly quirky . . . a little like me.  My daughter probably won't read it. In fact I am sure she won't. My coworker's definitley won't read it, as I am not going to givethe nosy braggers a copy.  I suppose I am just going to have to start boasting at work by telling people that I know a couple of things and that I am pleased with how my project is coming along, all just so people will quit giving me pitying looks.  My daughter, however, is going to have to live with me telling her she looks like a woolly mammoth. As Kate Fox says, it is in my DNA, I can't help myself. How else am I supposed to express love and devotion??
B00003CWL6|5.0|Last night's movie was \\"American Beauty\\" (awards edition) and it came off our DVD shelves. We watched it about 6 years ago but I barely remembered it except for a few scenes.<br /><br />Well, what can I possibly say for a movie that has over a thousand Amazon reviewers? I'm not even going to try to add anything new, just give a few of my impressions. It's an excellent movie. Without question. Just look at the review ratings. Look at the awards and critical acclaims it has received. Well, folks, it has earned those awards and accolades, but you might not particularly enjoy the movie.<br /><br />The acting is excellent, right across the board. First rate! The characters come across as real people in real life. Kevin Spacey, in particular, stands out and is the only person in the cast that I can sympathize with. All the rest deserve their fate, in my opinion, but that's getting a bit ahead.  The story involves an ordinary family (father, mother, teen-age daughter) in an ordinary small city (possible midwestern) living in an ordinary tree-lined street. The teen-age daughter has a best friend, I might add, who enters the picture and her mother has a real-estate colleague, who likewise enters into the story. Early in the movie, A marine and his family (father, mother, teen-age son) move in next door. Well, all of the main characters are dysfunctional in some of the worst possible ways. It's a social nightmare. Hopefully, this kind of thing can happen only in Hollywood depictions, but we all know, as we view the film, that it's happening all around us wherever we happen to live. The end result is the death of the lead  character in an abrupt and graphic way. The movie comes across as a type of comedy in many places and you'll be laughing from time to time, but it''s not a comedy, folks. It's tragic from beginning to end and there are no winners. Everyone loses.<br /><br />It's a good movie., Very well done. There's no crying here. None of the characters are the least bit sympathetic. I can easily see how it got so many awards.<br /><br />Gary Petersonympathetic. I can easily see how it got so many awards.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
0446698342|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a very different author. He is not the \\"happily ever after\\" time. On the contrary, he loves to surprised the reader by writing unexpected endings. Even though, is not the best I have read of him but I still like it. The book helps you to understand how awful war is for the soldiers. And, how difficult is for them to come back and live their lived again.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|Had I not watched R.J. Berger I likely would not have given Teen Wolf a shot.  I am old enough to remember when MTV broadcast music videos!  The migration to \\"all reality all the time\\" was not a welcome one.  However, I really do like the direction that MTV has been taking with edgy comedies like the aforementioned \\"Hard Times of R.J. Berger (which deserved a 3rd season) and \\"Awkward\\", along with drama's like \\"Teen Wolf\\" (have not watched Skins).<br /><br />Re: Teen Wolf.  The writing is good, there are enough plot twists to keep one guessing and occasional moments of fright to keep up the heart rate.  Also, Crystal Reed (23-years old in real life) isn't exactly hard on the eyes!<br /><br />Give this one a chance.

B00650SSWG|3.0|The two actors are very appealing in this story of a man and woman who want to be friends who have sex but who do not fall in love or have any further attachments.  As you can imagine, the plans go awry.  There is also the sadder aspect of the man's father having ALZ, but this ties in with what he eventually learns about himself and about love.<br />This will not be a good choice, though, for those put off by the raw sex talk and R-rated language.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Yes, it is a traditional kind of staging--realistic sets (as realistic as possible, given the limits of a stage production of a story that takes place in forests and rivers), appropriate costumes, clear lighting, and minimal special effects. In short, the production does not shout \\"Hey, look at me!\\" but lets the music be foremost, as it should be. The orchestral and vocal performance is excellent, and one of the most important reasons to favor this performance is James Morris as Wotan--he absolutely owns this role. Matti Salminen as Hagen is also unforgettable. I really see no weaknesses here. Even the camera work and sound quality are excellent. This seems to be a definitive Ring cycle unless one is looking for a daringly innovative production.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|If Evil Dead 2 is a sequel to the original Evil Dead, it is essentially a sequel to the original concept of the series, that is a story where demons, released from the pages of a book called the Necronomicon, haunt and torture college students who are staying inside a cabin down in the woods.<br /><br />For this version, everything that happened in the first movie has been retconned and modified. Of the college students staying at the cabin, only Ash and Linda are left to find the Necronomicon. Instead of seeing their woes for eighty minutes like in the first movie, everything is condensed in the first seven minutes as we then see what happens to Ash as he becomes the victim of the Necronomicon curse. Meanwhile, five other characters (Annie, Bobby Joe, Professor Ed Getley, Jake, and the dead Henrietta, played by the excellent Ted Raimi) come into the story and add a lot of baggage to the Necronomicon's true origins, including a shocking twist at the end.<br /><br />The special effects, both stop motion and gory juices, are more sophisticated than in the first movie and used to quite a comedic effect, especially with the hand of a certain character and his psychotic illusions. The camerawork is also perfect as it is once again used to film Ash's troubles, but also plays the role of the Necronomicon spirits as they hunt the characters around the house and the woods, a visual strategy that adds more tension to the story than any special effect done in post-production.<br /><br />The soundtrack by Joseph LoDuca is still as efficient as the first one, but is more classical than in the first movie, which was more experimental. Done with a larger orchestra, the score doesn't suffocate the movie and the characters' actions and is both comical and dramatic, adding the perfect atmosphere to the story.<br /><br />As for the script, this one was richer than the first movie and only kept the best elements of the first version of the Evil Dead story. Unlike the first movie, Evil Dead 2's story rhythm was faster and I didn't feel that some characters were useless to the movie. In fact, there were times I felt that certain traits of Scotty, Cheryl and Shelly were present in Ash, Linda and Annie. In terms of narration, classical devices are used as a narrator informs us of the origin of the book, flashbacks show us how Annie's family discovered the Necronomicon in Sumerian ruins. Finally, instead of doing a gore horror movie like in the first Evil Dead, Sam Raimi mixes more comedy in the story, which gives quite many funny scenes even though the situations are just horrible for all the characters, especially Ash's misadventures which take a final conclusion in Army of Darkness.Dead 2's story rhythm was faster and I didn't feel that some characters were useless to the movie.

0802798225|1.0|My niece was reading this book and asked me what I thought of it. I read it last year (2010) and was so incensed at how horrible it was, this review (which has undergone several revisions from the original pissed-off rant) has been sitting in My Documents until now when the discussion of Perfect Chemistry came up again.  I somehow managed to survive this EPIC RACEFAIL/GENDERFAIL of a book. Seriously, I wondered if author Simone Elkeles ever met a stereotype she didn't like or believe in.  To say that she has become an automatic never-buy-or-read-even-if-she-were-the-last-book-on-earth is an understatement<br /><br />I never set out to just hate a book sight unseen and even though I had the feeling Perfect Chemistry was going to be a perfect disaster, I gave it a chance because some of my Goodreads friends recommended it since they know I love interracial romance. Yes Virginia, I absolutely, positively HATED this book and it's the second book I've ever read where I wished I believed in book burning because this one would be roasting hot dogs by now.<br /><br />Did I mention how stereotype-laden this dreck thinly disguised as a YA romance was? Okay, try Mexican teenage boy who's poor and is in a gang meets pretty, White and rich teenage girl and they fall in love much to the consternation of the people around them. Really? Mexican teenage boy in a gang? Whoa. Just as good as Mexican boy as gardener. Or Mexican teenage boy as car wash attendant. I guess Mexican teenage boy as geeky science student from a stable and loving family wouldn't have worked, right Ms, Elkeles?  Don't tell me, readers wouldn't have bought it.<br /><br />Worse still are her descriptions of \\"gang life\\" which read like they came straight from the film 'American Me' or from the docu-series on A&E, 'Gangland'. It's basically over-the-top gratuitous from the point of view of a woman who thinks a little google research and some television shows are all that's needed to portray 'realistic' gang life sans nuance. The first thing I thought while reading about Alex was, why did he have to be in a gang? The story would have been just fine if he was just from the wrong side of the tracks, a poor kid with smarts trying to make good. And what was with the random high school-esque Spanish thrown in when Alex was talking with his family and his friends?<br /><br />Next on the chopping block, Brittany. There are few female characters I've had the urge to slap silly, and she's right at the top of the list. Puddles have more depth than this girl. Oh yes, she struggles to be perfect, but everything's about her looks. We're constantly told how she's this Barbie Doll brought to life with her perfect hair, skin, body, makeup, boyfriend, etc. Where's the rest of her? I'm sure she's smart but I never got that impression. I got the impression of a spoiled, self-centered little rich girl who tossed this Mexican gangbanger-gone-good named Alex at her upper-crust parents in order to piss them off. I just didn't see any indication that she really cared for Alex, nor he for her (since she was part of a bet over a car). Maybe it was the writing, which was just painfully bad.<br /><br />Unlike some readers, the sex and drugs aspect was probably the most accurate part of the book. Whether we want to deal with it or not, some teens are engaging in this behavior and we have to start dealing with it in an honest fashion. If there was any romance involved, I had a hard time seeing it because of all the rest of the FAIL.<br /><br />The sad fact that this book won so many awards is just mindboggling at best but also shows these groups need a serious shot of diversity on their panels. There's no way a book this racially insulting should be winning anything save a Razzie, if they had them for books. The sad thing is, there's a dearth of well-written YA interracial romances out there. We need them featuring well-rounded characters and not stereotypes.ns nuance.

B0051T47NQ|3.0|First than all I should say that I saw very good commentaries about this movie, and maybe for this, I was disappointed when I watched it. Other reason can be that in my country the myth of trolls is not popular and is hard to find someone that believes in these monsters. The film is not so bad, but its suspense's atmosphere and its characters never touched me and for this reason Troll Hunter is not gonna be one of my favorite horror movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Here is the review I posted over on my own site [ ... ]<br /><br />If you like dystopian fiction, you should read this book.  Originally begun as a short story, the first book in this series was fantastically well written. At 68 pages, I blew through it in an hour and wondered where the time had gone. I'm glad that the author decided to continue the story and then to sell them as a single book in the Omnibus edition.  This book made me feel like an addict, squeezing in a few pages at a time whenever I had a spare minute. It's been a long time since I was this strongly invested in a book.  It is such a compelling world, containing some great characters, and it all wraps up really nicely at the end.  I hate cliffhangers in a book when their isn't a sequel following it shortly (wait to see how I respond when I finish the Game of Thrones series and wait 5 more years for the last book).  I thought it was such a good exploration of how people react in a restricted society and about how little it can take to undermine authority.  I would love to learn more about the history that preceded the end of the surface world, it sounds like it came with the collapse of one of the world powers, I assume the USA, though they don't really say.  I wonder how they did it; wiping out all the people.  We may never know.  It would also be neat to learn about other survivors around the world, if there were any, either early on or later depending on how long they lasted, just because their preparations and ultimate goals would have been very different from that perspective.  It could turn this worlds future into a sort of ultimate cold war of who can last the longest.  And if someone won, they would never know any potential antagonist ever existed or why they were set against each other in the first place.  That said, Howey could do an entire series on what it would be like to reemerge from the silo into the new world.  [MINOR SPOILER ALERT] Interacting with people from the other silos for the first time, beginning to rebuild, and dealing with fear of the outside.  Would it begin with a few explorers venturing out?  Would ambassadors be sent to the nearby silos to initiate a dialog and develop a system for trading?  The whole point was to create a homogenous society, but would fighting break out between the different silos?  I certainly think that it would.  It's a part of human nature to find differences between groups and as fighting developed within groups in the silo, it would almost be assured to happen between silos.  Did the original planners think of this eventuality and plan for it?<br /><br />Howey just posted yesterday (2/27/12) that he is talking to someone about making it into a movie and apparently he already got an offer from the BBC to make it into a television series.  There is inherent risk in turning any good book into a movie, but if well done, I think it could be amazing.t time, beginning to rebuild, and dealing with fear of the outside.

B003UGLCIA|5.0|This is one of my two favorite horror movies (the other one is \\"The ring\\", please don't judge me for this). This movie is full of the most terrifying situations that I can remember in a horror movie. First 30 minutes are a little slow for my like, but suddenly you are involved in an extremely suspense climax. If you have catholic beliefs, maybe you will be touch even more.
B004G6009K|5.0|We happened to see Tangled in 3D in the theater and it was an amazing experience.  So, when it came out on Blu-ray, I chose to pay the extra and get the 3D version - even though at the time I didn't own a 3D TV.  This past Christmas, we remedied that and opted for an active 3D plasma.  WOW!  Tangled has become my favorite Blue-ray to watch in 3D.  Although you don't get the in-your-face, out-in-the-audience effects that you do in the theater, it is more like looking through a rectangular hole in the family room wall and watching a full-dimension play happening right behind it. Well done Disney!

What a fantastic read! I was immediately pulled in by the main character and her great personality! I absolutely love when a character has flaws and you can still love them and Katniss is definitely a character we can all love!<br /><br />I can't wait to see the movie, although somehow I don't think it will do the books justice.

B0059XTUMC|3.0|I might have liked this film but for its story. Anything would have been more interesting than another film about films and a slient movie about the end of slient movies. The same essential story has been done over and over again. Jean Dujardin does a fine job acting out the paint by numbers script and the novelty of reproducing the old form all the way down to the aspect ratio is interesting for a while. And the dog was good.<br /><br />But its all style and no substance. There are all sorts of ways that they could have gone with the story other than dump the whole bag of cliches out. The transition from slient to talking films is about more than just the actors whose careers ended. Sllient films were an international art form while talkies were inherently tied to the language of the performers. Talking films ended up being (initally) much more static and much more controlled (the need for a set where sound was controlled). And the accompying \\"industralization\\" of film production. All sorts of directions that are much more interesting that the old cliche about the out of work actor on the downward spiral.<br /><br />I wanted to like the film. But there just isn't enough there.

The opinions of several family members who loved it led me to plod on, and I am glad I did, finishing the last 200 pages in one night!  The further I got into it, the more compelling, informative and entertaining it became, especially the insider information on how drug companies bring new drugs to market. Grisham's keen ability to milk humor out of the most inept law firm ever will play well on the big screen.  Danny DiVito, here's a script taylor made for you! I can't wait.

B0067QPVD2|4.0|I like so many others loved the 1982 John Carpenter film. I was 12 when i saw it on HBO staying up late one night at my sisters.  It scared the crap out of me and I've always loved the movie for that reason, it is true horror and fear.  Upon watching this movie i was expecting to be let down even after a friend told me it was good.  To my surprise it was very good indded.  They did a great job connecting the films. They show the one guy that cut his own throat sitting in the chair all frozen is a great homage to the original.  I kept wondering though how would this film stand up if you've never seen the 82 version.  But becuase i did see the 82 version im giving it a must see rating!
0783231202|5.0|In the year that saw an Oscar-winning film about another notorious ship brought to the big screen, Steven Spielberg, the adoptive father of a few children of African-American descent, gave the world what was most likely a lesser-known story of U.S.-African relations, written by David Franzoni,and produced by Debbie Allen.<br />  I first learned the story of Sengbe Pei or Cinque(here played very charismatically, passionately, and intelligently by Djimon Hounsu) and the case of the Spanish ship La Amistad in a college history course. My professor mentioned many aspects of the horrors of slavery shown in the film, including suicide by jumping ship as a form of resistance. The audience is not spared the graphic scenes of brutal beatings and rapes of those on board, nor the sight of slaves being drowned.<br /> Amid  the mournful a capella sound of a female vocalist, which sets the dark tone for much of the film, a chained Cinque, trapped in the bottom of the Amistad with other captives, has been busy picking a nail from  a wooden beam, working despite the fact that his hands are bleeding--a nail that  will be used to pick the lock of the chains that bind him, tipping the hand of fate not only for himself, but for all the captors.<br /> That rainy night, Cinque breaks open a box of weapons and arms the captors, who do battle with the crew, killing most of them, although two Africans are shot to death in the struggle as well.<br />  The Spanish sea men Ruiz(Geno Silva) and Montes(John Ortiz) are left alive and at swordpoint, Cinque demands they steer the ship back to Africa, but after an odd encounter with  another ship in which  the Africans now on deck hide and restrain Ruiz and Montes while observing the other ship's passengers enjoying an elegant soiree, the Amistad goes ashore on American soil, and at some point the Africans taken into custody in New England.<br /> Although there could have been more subtitles for more of the Africans' commentary, Spielberg brilliantly captures the feeling of fear and alienation the Africans must have had as they experienced a whole new world in which most appear hostile to them, and even others of their race who don't understand them. Razaaq Adoti, as Yamba, is Cinque's friend and henchman.It is mostly through their dialogue that we come to understand their mindset during their incarceration.<br /> Taking their case after they are charged with murder for killing most of their captors is a young attorney named Roger Sherman Baldwin(Matthew McConaughey).<br /> A major dispute is which party has claim to these mutineers, and also whether they actually were from Africa, as Ruiz and Montez have falsified information about them, claiming they were from Cuba.British Lieutenants Meade(Darren E, Burrows), and Gedney(Ralph Brown),who seized the Amistad after the mutiny, also make claims in this case.<br /> As Cuba, the place where the captives were to be taken, is a Spanish colony, a young Queen Isabella II(Anna Paquin), who ages from nine to eleven during the two-year period of this story(1839-'41), acting upon the counsel of her advisor, also makes a claim that the slaves were hers, illustrating the point of why a spoiled, isolated, out-of-touch child, a slave to the machinations of more savvy adults should not be embroiled in political intrigues, much less sit on a throne.<br /> Morgan Freeman plays the fictional Theodore Joadson, who appears to have been based loosely on Frederick Douglas, a prominent voice in the abolitionist movement. Stellan Skarsgaard is his fellow abolitionist, Taffin.<br /> Nigel Hawthorne is an out-of-touch President Martin Van Buren, who seems perplexed about the significance of the Amistad case. Peter Postelthwaite plays the formidable prosecuting attorney, Holabird.<br /> We see how Joadson and Baldwin learn to communicate with the prisoners by learning to count in Cinque's spoken Mende with the help of a linguist, and counting aloud in the African marketplace to attract the attention of a native speaker who can interpret for them. They attract one Ensign Covey(Chiwetel Ejiofor), who successfully breaks the language barrier, easing the way to justice as the case opens before one Judge Juttson(Allen Rich).<br /> There are many setbacks for the defense as the threats against Baldwin mount.One moment of relevance is when the captives show the court they know enough English to make it clear to all that they want their freedom.<br /> Gradually Juttson is replaced by the younger Judge Coglin(Jeremy Northam), whom, as Secretary John Forsyth(David Paymer) notes, keeps silent about his own Catholic heritage to avoid his own persecution in a Protestant environment.<br /> There is a stirring moment as Yamba discusses the contents of a picture Bible a missionary handed him with Cinque.As they view and discuss the images of the man others know as Jesus, the judge who will tip the balance in their favor is alone before a cross in a chapel, reciting beautiful Latin breviaries as only Jeremy Northam can.<br /> At the state level, Baldwin initially triumphs. As Ruiz and Montez claims are found to be fraudulent, they are taken into custody for slave trading before the court and their former captives, as the captives' freedom is initially declared.<br /> But a setback at the national level angers Cinque, and increases his frustration in dealing with with a vast and complex system in the already alien and alienating world in which he and other Amistad captives have found themselves.<br /> On his third attempt in so doing, Baldwin finally procures the aid of former  President John Quincy Adams(a nuanced performance by Anthony Hopkins), who finally  takes a stand on the issue of slavery, bringing the story to its dramatic conclusion.<br /> While it has been noted that Adams never met the Amistad captives, the dramatic license taken is very effective. It shows Adams not shunning what he learns from Cinque, but incorporating it into his oration before the Supreme Court and winning the case.<br />  The dramatic scenes of a journey home in conjunction to John Williams' score play on a viewer's emotions, as do the powerful scenes of destruction of the slave fortress at Lomboko in Cinque's native Sierra Leone, and the counterbalance of the spoiled little girl-Queen, and the battle in the long-anticipated and dreaded American Civil War that brought her claim in the Amistad case to an end.<br /> As is often the case with historical drama, more than a few liberties are taken,  but a tale of how America returned to Africa at least a few of her children  at such an unlikely time in history is highly noteworthy.

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This writer has such an ability to understand human nature and develop it in her characters, making them deep and multifaceted. She is one of the few authors I regularly read and am never disappointed in. I was reluctant to tackle a book about suicide, for personal reasons, but am glad I read this one
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She really enjoyed it and we don't usually like live concerts. The music is close to the studio version of Adele's music and her commentary between songs is priceless.
